576849	1399158	65750	1.0	The Fury Of The Wolfman ( 1970 ) BOM	Apparently , this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime ; as I said earlier , although I've always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschy's werewolf pictures , this atrocity served as my introduction and , as awful as it most certainly is , I still intend to pursue other entries in the series , albeit very gradually . Despite some high profile disappointments like Joe Dante's THE HOWLING ( 1981 ) , I love werewolf pictures in general but , to be honest , I quickly lost interest in this film's " plot " and just stood there gazing at my TV screen counting its absurdities as it were . There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona ( i . e . going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed , zombie-like state in the very next one - as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside , and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot . . . and , yes , I did know the reasons for this beforehand ) , as well as the " Phantom Of The Opera " look of the Wolfstein character ! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic !
577917	1399158	82700	1.0	CANNIBAL FEROX ( Umberto Lenzi , 1981 ) BOM	This film is an imitation of an already poor prototype ? Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST ( 1979 ) ; ironically , the latter had spoken disparagingly of it at the 2004 Venice Film Festival ( to which Lenzi was himself invited though , of course , he wasn't present at the time ) . The only thing going for it is an appropriately doom-laden score ; otherwise , it emerges to be a barrage of pointlessly exploitative images ? from the totally gratuitous anaconda sequence to the extended and hilariously inventive torture scenes ( my favorite was the brain severing ) . Besides , the subplot involving the NYPD inserted to pad out the running-time feels completely out of place here ! Obnoxious characters , too , prevent any audience sympathy ? which only serves to make the journey even more of an ordeal ! The would-be ironic ending , then , is just stupid : at least CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST had questioned who the real cannibals were but , here , the leading lady ( who was so keen initially to disprove their existence ) has an unconvincing about-face by opting to do the conservative thing and sweep the whole matter under the proverbial rug ! P . S . While my father is usually averse to even the mildest of horror films ( being just not keen on the genre ) , I was surprised to learn that he had watched excerpts from a cannibal-related title some time ago on late-night Italian TV ; he still recalled a couple of the more outrageous moments from it , and it turned out that the film he was referring to was none other than CANNIBAL FEROX ! !
578220	1399158	52077	1.0	PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE ( Edward D . Wood Jr . , 1959 ) BOM	There's little I could say about this legendary film that hasn't been said before . Still , while it's undeniably a hoot ( particularly the script , composed of equal parts deadpan narration and jaw-dropping non-sequiturs ) , I don't find it all that enjoyable really ; it's simply too bad for its own sake ! Certainly the most regrettable - and saddest - aspect of the film is that it turned out to be Bela Lugosi's swan song ( though his brief scenes , re-used many times throughout , were actually shot for another production and incorporated into the narrative here when that project folded ! ) . Still , the decision to cast Tor Johnson ( whose awkward delivery of Wood's dialogue in itself is good for some chuckles ! ) as a Police Inspector was an inspired one , for all the wrong reasons ! There's also the camp solemnity of Criswell and the ghoulish appearance of Vampira ( more or less as themselves ) . . . and don't get me started on the other members of the cast , the non-existent special effects or the film's use of stock footage for its would-be action sequences ! ! Truth be told , I do want to watch Wood's remaining films - GLEN OR GLENDA ? ( 1953 ) , THE SINISTER URGE ( 1961 ) , NECROMANIA ( 1971 ) and even a few of the ones he wrote - but , like I said , their reputation as bad cinema doesn't readily translate into entertainment . . . and I'm not sure I want to part with my hard-earned cash merely for the pleasure of laughing at Wood's ineptitude ! Maybe , having recently been on a two-month film-making course in Hollywood - where , due to circumstances beyond my control , my personal showreel didn't prove exactly stellar ! - I tend now to find such ' trash ' somewhat uncomfortable to sit through . . .
577006	1399158	82363	1.0	FANTASIES ( John Derek , 1981 ; shot 1973 ) BOM	Bo Derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years ? and that's how it should stayed ! John Derek was a competent actor but , as a director , he's virtually the Ed Wood of erotic cinema ? not that this is especially explicit , considering that Bo ( atypically sporting dark hair ) was only 16 when the film was made ! John also wrote and photographed it ; the latter results in some decent footage of the Greek island setting against which the narrative is set ? but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious ! The character played by male lead Peter Hooten has been brought up with Bo's family : they grew up as brother and sister but , now in their teens , the couple discover they're attracted to one another ( but , as I said , don't expect any sexual fireworks ! ) . Still , the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness ? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view ( which , of course , it does at the finale ) ; Derek's is even nuttier ? she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub ! ! For the record , the couple are married by the end of the film . Also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of Bo ( and who , naturally , incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten ) . Occasionally , for no very good reason , we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles ( among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [ 1931 ] ) ! At the end of the day , while Bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming , it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness .
576066	1399158	56950	2.0	HERCULES AGAINST MOLOCH ( Giorgio Ferroni , 1963 )	This peplum has to be one of the low points of the entire genre : not only does it not generate any interest or particular excitement throughout ( most of the time I was merely confused by the plot overcrowded with factions , conspirators and usurpers ) , but the title itself is a cheat : Hercules doesn't really feature in it at all - it's merely the name under which hides muscle-bound hero Gordon Scott , actually the prince to a neighboring empire attempting to free Mycenae from the influence of paganism and the ruling corruption and sadism ; Moloch , then , is nothing like the man-eating God seen in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS ( 1927 ) but the disfigured heir - with his face hidden behind an iron mask shaped like a wolf's head ! - to the throne who's kept hidden in the dungeons ( with a line-up of drum-beating females as company ! ) and occasionally offered victims he can amuse himself with by shooting at them with arrows . Actually , the latter scenes are nicely atmospheric ( director Ferroni had earlier made the fine Gothic-horror piece MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN [ 1960 ] ) ; by the way , the minor peplum LE BACCANTI ( 1961 ) - also helmed by Ferroni - had featured a similar set of underground females , while some of the exterior scenes appear to have been lifted from the director's own - and vastly superior - THE Trojan WAR ( 1961 ) ! Interestingly , the villainous female lead is played by Rosalba Neri who's undeniably attractive but not yet the favored raunchy starlet of Euro-Cult ; also in the cast are Arturo Dominici ( as a despicable officer in Neri's service ) and Michel Lemoine ( in view of his unusual looks , it's surprising to find him on the side of the righteous and carry the film's secondary love interest to boot ! ) . Note : according to the DVD Drive-In review for Trimark's Box Set " The Adventures Of Hercules " , in which this film is included , it's written that Tim Lucas suspects that Mario Bava may have been involved in its making ; apart from the lighting scheme in the dungeon scenes with Moloch , as already mentioned , it's hard to agree with this - but , then , Bava's own peplums hardly constitute his best work . . .
576940	1399158	87451	2.0	THE ICE PIRATES ( Stewart Raffill , 1984 )	After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree : I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad ! Anyway , perhaps appropriately given the characters involved , the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN ( 1973 ) , ZARDOZ ( 1974 ) , LOGAN’S RUN ( 1976 ; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets ! ) , STAR WARS ( 1977 ) , ALIEN ( 1979 ) and MAD MAX 2 : THE ROAD WARRIOR ( 1981 ) ! The plot is simple but not exactly engaging : from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place – so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar ( ! ) rulers . Also involved is a beautiful princess ( Mary Crosby , daughter of Bing ! ) in search of her father , the deposed king ; by the way , the cast includes another famous offspring : Anjelica Huston ( daughter of John ) as one of the pirate band – thankfully , the actress’ mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an Oscar ( under her father’s guidance , no less ) for PRIZZI’S HONOR ( 1985 ) . Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the " Supreme Commander " , the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own – 78-year old John Carradine ( who’s seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene ! ) . The most notable bits ( for all the wrong reasons ) are : the alien using the toilet ; the castration machine ; the clumsy antics ( including karate-style combat ! ) of the inevitable robot companions ; the goofy slave / eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes ; the recurring attacks by the " space herpies " ( whatever that is ) ; the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp ( Crosby becomes pregnant , gives birth , and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds , while leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford stalwart Hank Worden for this scene ! ) – incidentally , the jump-cuts adopted here ( intending to denote the rapid passage of time ) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating .
577104	1399158	47127	2.0	JAIL BAIT ( Edward D . Wood Jr . , 1954 )	Not as well-known as Wood's notorious ' horror ' output but this truly lamentable attempt at a film noir - demonstrating , if only in its ramshackle production values , an affinity with the cinema of Orson Welles and Edgar G . Ulmer - is at least equally inept and hilarious , if still emerging as perhaps his most tolerable effort ! It's practically a manual on how NOT to make a noir : despite a generous dose of hard-boiled - yet godawful - dialogue ( particularly in the scenes depicting the gangster's constant bickering with his moll ) , the film has absolutely no sense of atmosphere , a headache-inducing and inappropriate score , an irrelevant musical number ( in blackface , to boot ! ) and some of the worst , most amateurish acting you're ever likely to see ! Perhaps the main culprit in this regard is elderly Herbert Rawlinson ( who , amazingly , kept working on such rubbish when he was dying of lung cancer and , in fact , kicked the bucket a day after production wrapped ! ) as an eminent surgeon who has to contend with a delinquent son ; the latter gets embroiled in armed robbery and murder and is subsequently killed by his associate , after the surgeon persuades him to give himself up to the Police . However , the gangster blackmails the old man into doing a makeshift job of plastic surgery in order to avoid capture - but , in perhaps the most uproarious scene of the entire film , the doctor discovers his son's corpse in the gangster's kitchen , without so much as a reaction , and decides to turn the tables on him . While not unpredictable , I must say that the twist ending works . . . but , unfortunately , the TV reception got screwed up during the last few minutes of the film , so I missed out on some of the details ! By the way , the younger of two cops who tail Rawlison's son throughout the film is none other than future peplum icon Steve Reeves in his film debut - and he looks as uncomfortable in a suit and tie as Chuck Heston ! !
577057	1399158	78848	2.0	TARGET ( Guido Zurli , 1979 )	This is surely one of the lamest poliziotteschi I've ever come across , with just about the only thing going for it being the unusual and exotic Istanbul locations . Even nominal star Luc Merenda is underused ; in fact , a lot of the running time is devoted to a Turkish family man who happens to be an infallible sharpshooter , and is unwillingly recruited by the mob in order to eliminate narc cop Merenda ( whom he has actually just befriended ! ) . One of the funniest things in the film is the fact that every male in Turkey is seen to be sporting a moustache ! Otherwise , the concoction is the same as before : tough hero ( heroes in this case ) , above-the-law financiers discussing their criminal business around a dinner table , their vicious thugs and abused molls , kidnappings , fisticuffs , shoot-outs , a bit of gratuitous nudity , bad disco soundtrack , etc .
576914	1399158	65243	3.0	ZETA ONE ( Michael Cort , 1969 )	I believe I first became aware of this sci-fi / sexploitationer via the biography for actress Valerie Leon included among the extras on the Anchor Bay DVD of Hammer's superior BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB ( 1971 ) ; incidentally , the film under review was made by rival company Tigon . To begin with , the script was apparently inspired by a comic strip ( such cinematic adaptations were all the rage at the time ? no doubt , the makers were encouraged by the success of BARBARELLA [ 1968 ] ) . Still , even reading through the cast list , I knew not to raise my ' artistic ' hopes too highly ? given that it featured both James Robertson-Justice and Charles Hawtrey , stalwarts of ( respectively ) the popular " Doctor " and " Carry On " comedy franchises ? who actually turn out to be the villains of the piece ! ! The narrative drew heavily on another then-current fad i . e . espionage ? in fact , the hero is a stud-like albeit laid-back secret agent who naturally proves irresistible to the alien women ( actually , an alternate moniker for the film ) the titular figure ( played by veteran Dawn Addams ) sends his way in order to derail his investigation into the abduction of several earth girls . That said , the plot is barely there and becomes especially confusing ? not to say silly ? during the latter stages ; for what it's worth , the film culminates in a chase wherein the otherworldly gals kill virtually all of their male pursuers simply by pointing their fingers at them ( accompanied by the incongruous noise of gunshots ) ! ! Needless to say , ZETA ONE's raison d'etre and prime asset is its relentless parade of innumerable but anonymous starlets of the era in the nude or otherwise scantily-clad : the above-mentioned Valerie Leon herself is underused , but fellow future Hammer lead Yutte Stensgaard ? who engages the hero ( to whom he's recounting his non-exploits ) in a lengthy and decidedly irrelevant game of strip-poker ? comes off quite well ( no pun intended ) . Also worth mentioning are the low-budget but appropriately psychedelic sets and the title tune ( featuring a reasonably effective guitar riff ) .
577948	1399158	51587	3.0	HEROD THE GREAT ( Viktor Tourjansky and Arnaldo Genoino , 1959 )	No sooner did I state in my review of THE PRODIGAL ( 1955 ) above that it was going to be my only tribute to the late Edmund Purdom , that a visit to the local DVD rental shop also provided me with the opportunity to watch this Italian biblical flick . Unfortunately , the end results were even less satisfactory than that earlier Hollywood epic ! For one thing , Purdom makes for a decidedly wooden ruler of Judea who , at the film's start , is seen returning from a lost battle against Octavius Caesar ( ! ) to find all of his elderly subjects ( who , naturally , had stayed home ) seemingly out for his blood ! Even his son and mother-in-law openly hate and scorn him ! Eventually , Herod regains his composure with the appearance of his wife ? and how could it have been otherwise when she is portrayed by the red-headed , curvaceous beauty Sylvia Lopez ? Tragically , in real life she would be dead of leukemia before the year was out but not before making Steve Reeves ' head spin in her most significant role in HERCULES UNCHAINED ( 1959 ) ! Out of the blue , then , the film's second half takes the form of a retread of Shakespeare's " Othello " with Purdom the jilted monarch , Lopez the compromised queen , Alberto Lupo as Herod's innocent right-hand man and Corrado Pani ( as young Herod Antipas ) as his Iago-ish brand new confidant ! The strain is too much for Herod-Purdom to bear and , a little while after ordering the proverbial slaughtering of Judea's first born , he just keels over and dies at the foot of his throne ! Ugh ? which is a pity since a few months ago I had rather enjoyed Purdom's next collaboration with director Tourjansky , THE COSSACKS ( 1960 ) ? which also shares at least three other distinguished participants ( actor Massimo Girotti , screenwriter Damiano Damiani and cinematographer Massimo Dallamano ) with this one .
577730	1399158	64175	3.0	BOOT HILL ( Giuseppe Colizzi , 1969 )	This Spaghetti Western was the third teaming of popular duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer ; the previous two were also in the same genre and directed by Colizzi . Unfortunately , its muddled plot line of gold-prospecting and claim-jumping ( shades of the Rex Beach venerable " The Spoilers " ) is rendered even less intelligible in the budget DVD edition I watched by the rampant panning-and-scanning throughout ? which cramps the on screen action so much that what remains is virtually a succession of disconnected close-ups ! The only original touch here is the fact that the heroes are aided in their struggle against the villainous exploiters by a troupe of traveling circus performers ; one other point in its favor is a solid supporting cast , which includes not only familiar genre presences such as George Eastman but a clutch of Hollywood veterans ? namely Lionel Stander , Woody Strode , Eduardo Ciannelli and Victor Buono ( as the outwardly respectable chief baddie ) .
576047	1399158	122779	4.0	REVENGE OF URSUS ( Luigi Capuano , 1961 )	Despite a meaningless title and a lead ( Samson Burke ! ) who gives new meaning to the word " wooden " , this is not too bad for what is essentially a formulaic muscleman effort . The plot is typically chockful of court intrigues within Ursus ' camp ? by way of the King's deceitful rotund consultant who contrives to have his own master killed , Ursus convicted of the crime and appointing bald-headed Livio Lorenzon ( an above-average village who keeps a leopard for a pet ) as his people's new ruler ; a couple of attractive ladies : one good ( Ursus ' fiancée ' , of course ) and one evil ( who , clad in an iron mask , even disguises herself as the latter at the King's wedding ceremony ! ) ; and , to up the suspense factor somewhat , an independent-minded kid brother for the hero ( from whom he tries to keep his superhuman past by posing as an indefatigable farmer ) ! For what it is worth , at one point the action once again requires Ursus to engage in a tug-of-war with a number of elephants ? although here he needs their impending threat to his little sibling for him to eventually manage in suppressing them !
576243	1399158	87247	4.0	FEAR CITY ( Abel Ferrara , 1984 )	This early flick from Abel Ferrara piles on the sleaze as it deals with a group of strippers being hounded by an unknown night-time assailant ; from a surprisingly good cast for such cheap exploitation fare , Melanie Griffith scores best as the most popular stripper around , who also happens to be her moody boss ( Tom Berenger ) ' s ex , indulges in a lesbian relationship on the side ( with fellow stripper Rae Dawn Chong ) and turns into a full-blown junkie when the latter dies at the hands of our good friend , the serial killer . Nice clean family fare , then , right ? While the film remains watchable throughout and even has a handful of amusing sequences ( most notably when , having been mistaken for the killer , the wrong guy gets beaten up in the kitchen of one of these clubs ) and performances ( in particular , Michael V . Gazzo as an irascible strip-joint owner ) , it is seriously damaged by a frankly dull hero ( or rather anti-hero , since we're basically talking about an ex-boxer-turned-pimp here ) and a very silly villain ( a karate expert / fitness freak / budding writer ) . Billy Dee Williams also stars as an irate cop disgusted by all the squalor around him and Rossano Brazzi turns up for a free plate of pasta as the pre-requisite " respectable " mobster overseeing NYC's underworld . For the record , the film was originally bankrolled by Twentieth-Century Fox but they eventually sold the property to an independent company in view of its objectionable content and a cleaned-up , padded-out version eventually made the rounds on US TV and European videos ; also , the actor playing the serial killer remains uncredited to the end , just as the killer's name is never known throughout the film .
576255	1399158	57227	4.0	KISSIN’ COUSINS ( Gene Nelson , 1964 )	It should come as no surprise to anyone that , before now , I was only familiar with the two best-regarded of Elvis Presley’s films , namely JAILHOUSE ROCK ( 1957 ) and FLAMING STAR ( 1960 ) . However , since this year marks the 30th anniversary of his death , I made it a point to watch as many of his movies I could lay my hands on . . . a sort of " it’s now or never " type of situation , if you will ! Actually , I had caught the beginning of this one on local TV several years ago , where it was shown as part of a mini Elvis retrospective . The " citizens vs . missile-base " plot line here is basically the rural version of Leo McCarey’s RALLY ‘ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! ( 1958 ) but , as it turns out , the hillbilly antics get tiresome pretty quickly – especially whenever the man-chasing Kittyhawks turn up , which is too often for my tastes ! The best gag , then , is when Captain Jack Albertson suddenly leaves the farmers’ dinner table – after " Ma " Glenda Farrell describes the stomach-turning contents of the " delicious " meal he has just partaken of , and " Pappy " Arthur O’Connell asks his soldier kin Elvis if something has come up , to which the latter matter-of-factly quips , " Not yet , but I think it might " ! For what it’s worth , the songs are variable and unmemorable ( except , perhaps , for the title tune ) and even Farrell gets her own maudlin number ! This film is perhaps best-known for offering a dual role for The King , one of whom is a brown-haired layabout , but this eventually leads to an unintentionally hilarious ending where the two characters share the screen doing a number , but every time one sings , the other conveniently turns his back to the camera and a longshot exposes Elvis’ double all-too-clearly !
577700	1399158	78477	4.0	THE WATER BABIES ( Lionel Jeffries , 1978 )	Very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of MARY POPPINS ( 1964 ) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS ( 1971 ) . The human cast is very distinguished - James Mason , Billie Whitelaw , David Tomlinson , Joan Greenwood , Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast ( a 69 year-old Mason as a thieving chimney-sweep ! ) to the inconsequential ( Greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat ) to the bizarre ( Whitelaw plays several ' exotic ' characters - including a circus performer , an old hag , a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason ) . The animated segment of the film , handled by a group of East-European animators , is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and , as usual , with this type of thing , there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with , one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good . The film was directed by noted character actor Jeffries who had previously directed ( far more successfully ) other children's films namely THE RAILWAY CHILDREN ( 1970 ) and THE AMAZING MR . BLUNDEN ( 1972 ; which I've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on R2 DVD by Anchor Bay UK ) .
578217	1399158	57267	4.0	MACHORKA-MUFF ( Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet , 1963 )	I’ve somehow never been drawn towards pursuing the work of these art-house film-makers ( even if a good many of them have turned up over the years on a specialized programme on late-night Italian TV ) ; having now , at long last , stumbled upon one of them I can understand why ! The premise of the 17-minute short , in itself , isn’t too bad – a number of former Nazi officials reconvene years later in order to bestow an honor upon a former colleague – but the treatment is so austere as to be alienating , resulting in a largely unappetizing film ! Intermittently , however , there’s an agreeable irreverence at work here : to begin with , all the Nazis have two surnames ( and always starting with the same letter , such as the titular figure ) ; a dream sequence in which the protagonist enters a museum and uncovers a statue atop a balcony of himself ; the illusion that military men can do no wrong because at no point in the Bible does Christ judge them ! ; the recipient of the tribute – a Major who had suffered dishonor , and subsequently died in exile , because his company suffered losses in combat amounting to a mere 8 , 500 men – has his reputation restored in the wake of an investigation which has firmly established that the death toll was actually in excess of 14 , 500 ! !
576570	1399158	109884	4.0	Genesis - The Creation And The Flood ( Ermanno Olmi , 1994 )	My father rented " The Bible Collection " DVDs over the Easter period , but I was interested in watching only two of these and that was only because of who directed them - this one by Italian film-maker Olmi and the already-reviewed SAMSON AND DELILAH ( 1996 ) by Nicolas Roeg . Of course , as Roeg's film obviously elicited largely unfavorable comparisons to Cecil B . De Mille's 1949 spectacular , so too does this one to John Huston's notorious 1966 biblical flop . Still , much as that film proved a disappointment , its undeniable grandeur is vastly preferable to the ordinariness and quasi-documentary style of Olmi's effort ( the star cast Huston assembled certainly didn't hurt - whereas here only Italian actor Omero Antonutti is recognizable at all , as the rest of the cast is comprised of non-professional Moroccans ) ! To be fair to Olmi , he handles the events with some imagination - as they're presented in the form of campfire tales narrated by nomad Antonutti ( who also takes on the role of Noah ) to his people - and the images ( accentuated by Ennio Morricone's wistful score ) are often poetic . . . but the over-familiarity of it all and the distinct lack of excitement displayed throughout results in sheer dullness ! Thankfully , the film is only around an hour and a half in length - whereas most of the other titles in " The Bible Collection " ran for something like twice that running-time ( as does , after all , John Huston's THE BIBLE - IN THE BEGINNING itself ) . One other asset to the film , at least in its English-dubbed version I watched , is the melodious voice of Paul Scofield ( who dubs Antonutti throughout ) .
577660	1399158	82497	4.0	THE HAND ( Oliver Stone , 1981 )	Nobody can ever accuse Michael Caine of not having had a fascinating career . His incredibly prolific filmography ( 132 appearances and counting in just over 50 years ) is littered with high highs ( a handful of all-time classics and 2 Academy Awards ) and low lows ( actually , from quite early on in his career to , unsurprisingly , the present day ) . Still , the latter bunch are , for all their glaring faults , hardly unwatchable and , at times , fairly tolerable and this rare horror item is certainly among his more interesting failures . Apart from its horror elements and the chance to watch another Michael Caine stinker ( although , as it turns out , Jon Voight and Christopher Walken had both previously turned down the lead role ) , the film's main draw nowadays is watching an early ( though not the first ) directorial stint from Oliver Stone ( he even has an amusing unbilled cameo as an ill-fated tramp ) and , most intriguingly , within an exploitation genre from which he has distanced himself completely since then . As I mentioned earlier , the film ends up being less the disastrous embarrassment I had anticipated and more a watchable ( if hardly original ) horror flick which moves rather slowly but has has the occasional effective shock moment to satiate genre fans . In fact , Stone infuses the film with a modicum of style including subjective shots from the marauding hand's point of view , delirious dream sequences often shot in monochrome and , most incredibly , an utterly grisly freak car accident sequence ( with fake blood galore ) early on in the film in which cartoonist Caine loses his drawing hand and which sets the narrative in motion . The thing is that , while it starts well enough , the film is soon bogged down by repetitive marital squabbles between an increasingly unhinged Caine and his free-spirited wife Andrea Marcovicci . Besides , Caine's stump is not exactly the greatest and , when all is said and done , we have been here once too often and I only need to point out the other more notable cinematic examples of " the walking hand " - THE HANDS OF ORLAC ( 1924 ) , MAD LOVE ( 1935 ) THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS ( 1946 ) , THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL ( 1962 ) , DR . TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS ( 1965 ) and . . . AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS ! ( 1973 ) - for this film's relative redundance to become apparent . Still , that such an old-fashioned concept was revived at this point in time and by these film-makers is extraordinary in itself but , even if they did try to bring it up-to-date with the addition of gore and sleaze , I can't say I was too surprised by the twist ending which - while not making a great deal of sense and somewhat dispelling the strong similarities with Michael Caine's previous role in another imitative ( but much more successful ) slasher , DRESSED TO KILL ( 1980 ) , which had previously been to the fore - provided Hollywood veteran Viveca Lindfors with a very brief but notable cameo as Caine's no-nonsense shrink .
577197	1399158	106317	4.0	ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN ( TV ) ( Christopher Guest , 1993 )	A smartly feminist reading of the 1958 camp classic is the basis of this made-for-TV remake which needlessly opens up the proceedings by adding some 25 minutes of " character development " – which , basically , means new personalities who further traumatize or assist the distressed titular female . Daryl Hannah has trouble coping with the ugly duckling part of the story but grows nicely into her role once the gigantic transformation comes along and in which she is curiously but attractively decked out in cavewoman garb ! Excepting the rather obnoxious Daniel Baldwin ( as Hannah’s philandering husband ) , the rest of the cast is capable enough : Frances Fisher is Hannah’s helpful shrink , William Windom is her greedy tycoon father and , best of all , Cristi Conaway is Baldwin’s sexy mistress who practically changes to a more outrageous wig with every new scene she’s in ; I knew nothing of her going in but , being sufficiently impressed I looked up her resume ' on IMB and , what do you know , she was once married to an actor of presumably Maltese origins named Salvator Xuereb ! ! This is all well and good , perhaps , but I still wouldn’t say that this is an improvement on the unjustly maligned original ; for one thing , there are no giant aliens to be seen here and , worse still , the goofy fat deputy is ( predictably , under the circumstances ) replaced by a squeaky , tomboyish girl . The sheriff and his deputy are here depicted as being avid drive-in cinema-goers and , at one point , Hannah rips off the roof of a cinema which is screening the 1958 original ! The new coda is also quite amusing : having been received inside the spaceship which caused her enormous growth , Hannah is joined by two other gigantic beauties who , sure enough , look upon their tiny hubbies as they go confessing to their various infidelities in interstellar group therapy !
577949	1399158	55923	4.0	WOMEN OF THE WORLD ( Gualtiero Jacopetti , Franco Prosperi and Paolo Cavara , 1963 )	After a little over 5 years from its release , Blue Underground's " The Mondo Cane Collection " is still , for my money , the biggest scam in the history of DVD . It's not because the films themselves were not as " shocking " as they had been played up to be ( I had watched most of them on Italian TV already ) or because the discs were shoddily presented but for the reason that , after hyping their " 10 , 000 Limited Edition " status ? which doubtlessly duped many a serious film collector ( myself included ) into springing for the $120 set ? these same films ( indeed discs ) have subsequently , in 2005 and 2008 , been variously reissued by the same company under different combinations for half the price they were originally being offered for ! This deceit perhaps explains why it has taken me all this time to pop any of the 8 discs included in the original set into my DVD player for the first time ? although , as I said before , only 2 of them ( the title under review and the feature-length documentary on the duo of controversial film-makers ) had been completely unfamiliar to me . As it turned out , WOMEN OF THE WORLD was pretty blah as well ? which kind of increased my despondency about the whole bloody affair ! Anyway , what we have here is a disparate depiction of the plight of women around the world circa 1962 : from Israeli freedom fighters to Japanese pearl divers , from mature Hamburg whores to Swiss pain-free birth clinics , etc . Actually , watching the women from the exotic regions going about their strenuous daily work routine ( carrying heavy loads and so on ) while their lethargic husbands look impassively on , laze about or , worse still , put on make up and act queer , did provoke the occasional heckle from the undersigned but , I regret to say , it was mostly a rather dull ride . At least , the music ( by Riz Ortolani and Nino Oliveiro ) is , typically for like product , quite good . While on the Italian version , the occasionally witty narration is provided by one of the film-makers himself ( Jacopetti ) , the English translation ( which is also present on the disc and , inexplicably , it reverted to while I was watching ) is read by Peter Ustinov !
575970	1399158	63847	4.0	ZORRO THE FOX ( Guido Zurli , 1968 )	Disposable Italian-made adventure of the popular swashbuckling hero which actually plays like a Spaghetti Western ( these were all the rage at the time ) ? not , in itself , a bad thing but the treatment is strictly uninspired ! For what it's worth , bland ( and blonde ) leading man Giorgio Ardisson had already played the character in THE MASQUED CONQUEROR aka ZORRO AT THE Spanish COURT ( 1962 ) ; the heroine , then , is played by Femi Benussi ( though she's given very little to do ) and the villain by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart . The tone is typically light-hearted ? but the comic relief supplied by Sergeant Gomez ( this must have looked at the Disney TV series for inspiration rather than the 1940 Hollywood classic ! ) and a couple of peones , one of whom is perennially coming up with crackpot idioms to make a point , who always seem to get in the way somehow ! For once , rather than have the common people rise up against the tyrants , here it's the noblemen targeted by the ambitious Rossi-Stuart and the Alcalde of a neighboring town , who join Zorro in the good cause ; with this in mind , the climax is O . K . as a multitude of Zorros appear on the scene to confuse the villains . If anything , the swordfights throughout are handled with reasonable energy ? though it all ends on an extremely silly note ? with Zorro's pet carrier pigeon promising us further exploits of the Californian avenger ( which , needless to say , never came to pass , at least in this company ) !
576625	1399158	382625	5.0	THE DA VINCI CODE ( Ron Howard , 2006 )	Given all the controversy surrounding the film , the end result couldn't help being a disappointment - but , coming from Howard , I had no real expectations anyway ! The premise is intriguing in itself - personally , I wasn't bothered by its questioning of Christ's divinity and the possibility that a descendant of his may still be alive - but the plot is simply too complex to be absorbed in a single viewing ( I never read Dan Brown's novel ) . Reportedly , it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the source material but this results in a lot of padding ( too many stops for exposition , including needless character development ) and , consequently , gross overlength for what should essentially be a gripping conspiracy thriller . With regards to performances , while I'm not usually a fan of Tom Hanks I didn't mind him all that much here ( although his hairstyle was an eyesore ! ) , liked Audrey Tatou and Ian McKellen was typically imposing - but the rest ( Jean Reno , Alfred Molina and especially a ludicrous turn from Paul Bettany ) were quite boring ! What had been the film's most discussed sequence prior to its release - Jesus ' wedding , actually shot in Malta - was barely seen in the released version ! I wonder if there was any pressure on the film-makers for this scene to be removed and , hopefully , it will be included as part of an eventual DVD edition . . .
577111	1399158	35096	5.0	The Mummy's Tomb ( 1942 ) :	When I first watched this , some 4 years ago , I remember being very disappointed with it and recall labeling it a lazy overall effort , especially as it heavily borrowed footage not only from the previous film - THE MUMMY'S HAND - but also FRANKENSTEIN ( 1931 ) , BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN ( 1935 ) and THE WOLF MAN ( 1941 ) for its mob scenes at the climax ! However , coming back to it now - and despite having just watched the other " Kharis " films - I found it to be quite enjoyable , atmospheric and competently handled ( especially during Chaney's various rampages and the fiery finale ) . It was nice to see Dick Foran , Wallace Ford and George Zucco ( why on Earth did he wait 30 years to exact his revenge ? ! ) reprise their roles from THE MUMMY'S HAND , if only briefly , as it was to have Mary Gordon - Mrs . Hudson of Universal's contemporaneous " Sherlock Holmes " series - as one of Chaney's victims . As for Chaney himself , I thought that his first stab at the role wasn't bad at all : suitably brutish when required but with a hint of emotion seeping through the wrappings on occasion to provide a balance ( especially when Turhan Bey , yet another misguided High Priest of Karnak , is liable to jeopardize their ' mission ' of restoring Princess Ananka to life by conveniently falling for leading lady Elyse Knox ) .
576934	1399158	52703	5.0	THE COSSACKS ( Viktor Tourjansky and Giorgio Rivalta , 1960 )	Some time ago , I'd watched the above-average peplum THE MONGOLS ( 1961 ) , co-directed by Andre ' De Toth and action sequences helmed by Riccardo Freda ; back then , I had written that it was probably made in the wake of THE VIKINGS ( 1958 ) and that more epics in this vein followed ? with the film under review being one of them . Interestingly , the father / son antagonism plot line here anticipates another favorite Hollywood spectacle ? TARAS BULBA ( 1962 ) ? though that was actually based on a famous Nikolai Gogol novel which had already been filmed at least twice before ; anyway , the results in this case ? the narrative being slightly unbalanced by pageantry and local color ? were rather patchy ( though not without interest ) . The latter , in fact , is mostly due to surprisingly nuanced leads ( Edmund Purdom and John Drew Barrymore , both ex-Hollywood alumni who eventually became peplum regulars ) . The dual romance for the young protagonist ( the Cossack leader's offspring had been bartered during an earlier struggle and , in the interim , received his education at a Russian military academy ) is something of a cliché , but it's not too intrusive under the circumstances . In any event , coming into play towards the end ? when Barrymore is returned to his people so as to dissuade Purdom from keeping up his " holy war " ? the girlish rivalry complements the tense situation between father and son ; besides , with Barrymore having at one point saved the hated Czar's life , the Cossack leader publicly disowned him in favor of a devoted warrior / follower ? who , naturally , doesn't appreciate now the unexpected re-appearance on the scene of the ' prodigal son ' ! The film is typically climaxed by a sweeping battle ? with the Cossacks , greatly outnumbered , ending up decimated ? which is quite well done as these things go ; however , it's undeniably enhanced by the inevitably tragic ( and commendably abrupt ) denouement ? as Purdom is forced to shoot down Barrymore ( whom he perceives a coward for wanting to throw in the towel ) ? but soon realizes it has been a desperate , unfortunate and merely futile gesture ! By the way , THE COSSACKS has some notable credentials : co-scriptwriter Damiano Damiani and cinematographer Massimo Dallamano would both graduate to a director's position , ditto camera operator Sergio D ' Offizi became a d . p . and work on such interesting and stylish fare as DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING ( 1972 ) ; besides , the supporting cast includes the likes of " special guest star " Massimo Girotti ( from OSSESSIONE [ 1943 ] and THEOREM [ 1968 ] , appearing briefly as Alexander II ) , Giorgia Moll ( from CONTEMPT [ 1963 ] , as Barrymore's Russian girlfriend ) and Pierre Brice ( the hero of the fine Gothic horror MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN [ 1960 ] , playing Moll's childhood friend and Barrymore's military companion ) .
576991	1399158	470132	5.0	KIBAKICHI ( Tomoo Haraguchi , 2004 )	The Japanese had already tackled King Kong , Frankenstein and Dracula in the past ? so it was only a matter of time before an Asian Werewolf movie came along ! I had never heard of the film before chancing upon it at the local DVD rental outlet , but the prospect of a Werewolf Samurai seemed too unique to pass by . Actually , what little monster action there is , is restricted to the opening and climactic sequences but they are both busy , well-staged fights that satiate one's expectation of what a Samurai film should provide . The rest of it is a muddled and rather dreary narrative about the Yokai ( monster people ) being ousted by the deceitful humans once and for all , with our hero eventually getting engaged by the leader of the former as one of his henchmen . Again , the opportunity for creative make-up design is not taken to the fullest and falls far short of other foreign ' monster parade ' shows like , say , the Russian VIY , OR SPIRIT OF EVIL ( 1967 ) . What the film does get utterly right is its faithful recreation of the Samurai era which admirably make the film look , sound and feel like something from the early 1960s ! The hero is a taciturn loner with long , shaggy hair who gets to interact ( but , thankfully , not get romantically involved ) with a human girl adopted by the Yokai leader long ago . Apparently , the film proved successful enough on its home ground to be followed by a sequel that very same year !
578176	1399158	38937	5.0	SHOCK ( Alfred Werker , 1946 )	While I'd have been interested in this film regardless , given its genre ( Noir ) and star ( Vincent Price ) , I knew not to expect much from it in view of Leonard Maltin's dismissive rating . With this in mind , I was amazed to see this programmer restored and released as part of Fox's vaunted Noir series on DVD ahead of much more renowned titles ? but that may have had more to do with the fact that SHOCK has lingered in Public Domain hell for a long time , and the studio was eager to ' reclaim ' its property by preparing an edition that was clearly superior to every other available version ( with respect to print quality , transfer and supplements ) and sell it at a very affordable price ! That said , I've purchased all of Fox's Noir titles save 3 ? SHOCK itself , VICKI ( 1953 ) and NIGHTMARE ALLEY ( 1947 ; though I do own this via the superior " Masters Of Cinema " R2 disc ) ? but , ashamedly , I must admit that I've yet to check out any of them ( and there are even 5 first-time viewings in there ! ) ? Anyway , after this longish introduction , let's talk about the film proper : watchable ( being a mere 70 minutes long helps ) , not uninteresting in itself ( if decidedly unoriginal ? the doctor who's been commissioned to help restore a girl's sanity is actually the perpetrator of the murder which drove her into a catatonic state to begin with ! ) and quite atmospheric ( a surreal dream sequence is nicely done and the film's highlight is the rather irrelevant sequence where a homicidal inmate attacks the head nurse in the heroine's room one stormy night ) but it's also very formulaic , thus predictable every step of the way ( who could Price be but the villain , albeit a fairly sympathetic one ? ) ? and , ultimately , too low-key for its own good ( the leading lady is a non-entity ? which considerably dilutes the suspense ? the femme fatale bland and the abrupt wrap-up concludes the film on something of a whimper ) ! I watched this via the Madacy " Vincent Price Collection " DVD which , ostensibly , also includes 3 other PD titles featuring the iconic star ? THE BAT ( 1959 ) and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH ( 1964 ) are there , yes , but HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL ( 1958 ) is nowhere to be found , despite its name appearing on the " Main Menu " screen ( admittedly , the disc I have is a DVD-R and the film may not have been replicated due to a technical glitch ) ?
576933	1399158	61397	5.0	MOVING TARGET ( Sergio Corbucci , 1967 )	After director Corbucci made his mark with the seminal Spaghetti Western DJANGO ( 1966 ) , he didn't merely restrain himself to that genre ? though his work in the field is surely among the most highly regarded ( incidentally , I'll be delving for the first time into two more such efforts in the coming days ) . For this " Euro-Cult " outing , he changed the typical desert landscape in Almeria for the equally evocative streets and landmarks of Athens ; the film , in fact , is a generally lighthearted foray into contemporary espionage ? however , the results aren't nearly as rewarding as Corbucci's more individualistic ' horse operas ' ! To begin with , the American hero ( Ty Hardin ) is rather bland ? he's a notorious thief who's brought in by plane to serve a sentence in the Greek capital ; however , before he has even had time to put his feet on the ground , Hardin is ' kidnapped ' by Communist spies in order to retrieve a microfilm embedded in one of the teeth of a dead man ! A number of other entities soon reveal themselves to be just as interested in its contents ? including " Albanian " Gordon Mitchell and mysterious British agent Michael Rennie ; the only man the hero can trust is former associate Vittorio Caprioli ? playing a character called Pizza ( ! ) and currently the owner of a sleazy but popular nightclub in town ( with vivacious blonde stripper Graziella Granata as star attraction ) . Another girl is also involved ? Paola Pitagora ? who's introduced as a ' murder victim ' of Hardin's , with which the Communists can then blackmail him into acquiescence ! ; that said , she's an unwilling accomplice ? since the girl's infant nephew ( her deceased sister had been involved with the man in possession of the microfilm ) is being held behind the proverbial Iron Curtain . It's pretty convoluted stuff albeit reasonably engaging while it's on ? with plenty of double-crosses , chases ( especially effective when atypically set against the imposing ruins of the famed Acropolis ) , fistfights , shoot-outs , explosions , and what have you ? even if , in the long run , it emerges as little more than a footnote in the director's career ! The film turns a bit serious during its latter stages as both women are killed off , and Caprioli takes a severe beating from Mitchell and his thugs ; the narrative then concludes with a dual twist ? first revealing the identity of the chief spy , who's subsequently deported , but then we're shown that he has made off with a copy of the prized microfilm ( which , for what it's worth , involved fabricated evidence to incriminate a specific faction for a proposed coup d'etat to be executed by their rivals ! ) after all . The bouncy score by DJANGO , KILL ! ' s Ivan Vandor is notable ? as are the stylish end credits ( a characteristic element of spy sagas from this era ) .
576875	1399158	66483	5.0	TRANSPLANT ( Steno , 1970 )	Grotesque , crude but often quite funny knockabout farce which outstays its welcome and does not always fully realize its satirical aspirations . The film deals with an American billionaire , who having married a luscious young wife some 50 years his junior , often breaks into sobbing fits at the sight of her ; it does not take long for us to learn that all is not well between them in the bedroom stakes and he decides ( with the aid of a computer and a coterie of advisers ) to have an organ transplant . No prizes in guessing which organ he is needful of . . . ! After a series of false starts , they arrive to the three final prospective candidates , all of which are , coincidentally , Italian . One is an idiotic but clearly well-endowed brute who , having been " gang-raped " by a group of Swedish female sunbathers , wants nothing else except to go back for more , another is an unassuming family man who happens to have 14 kids and is constantly being harassed by his avaricious relatives into accepting the " job " and , thirdly , a nouveau pauvre Sicilian aristocrat who spends the time dodging his creditors by day and bedding their wives by night ! They are put to several strenuous tests to prove their maximum virility during the course of which they naturally start having second thoughts about going through with the operation . . . The film , co-written by popular Italian comic and latter-day TV personality Raimondo Vianello , stars Carlo Giuffre ' as the impoverished Latin Lover and the diminutive Renato Rascel who , playing the mild-mannered but prodigious father , has much more screen time than his " Special Guest Star " billing would suggest . Director Steno ( real name Stefano Vanzina ) was an expert handler of comics having dealt with the likes of Toto ' , Alberto Sordi , Nino Manfredi , Paolo Villaggio , Terence Hill , Bud Spencer , etc . - not to mention such Hollywood legends as Gloria Swanson , Orson Welles , Christopher Lee and Peter Ustinov ! - throughout his long and distinguished film career .
578195	1399158	64787	5.0	A QUIET PLACE TO KILL ( Umberto Lenzi , 1970 )	To begin with , when I acquired this , I was under the impression it'd be the 1969 Lenzi / Carroll Baker giallo released in English-speaking countries as PARANOIA and originally given the lurid title ORGASMO ; I watched that film , which was quite decent ( and had a jaw-dropping final twist , to boot ) , during the 2004 Venice Film Festival ? with the genial elderly director in attendance ! This one , then , was released in Italy as PARANOIA and , to confuse matters even more , its English title was very similar to the director's follow-up effort ( and which I'll get to presently ) , UN POSTO IDEALE PER UCCIDERE ? translating to AN IDEAL PLACE TO KILL ? which was itself retitled OASIS OF FEAR for export purposes ! For the record , Lenzi made eight giallos in all : none would perhaps rank among the genre's finest offerings ? though , with this , I'm only half-way through them ( having checked out KNIFE OF ICE [ 1972 ] and SPASMO [ 1974 ] as well , the latter also at Venice as part of a night-long marathon ! ) . Anyway , the film turned out to be something of a disappointment : the plot recalls Henri Georges Clouzot's classic DIABOLIQUE ( 1955 ) but , given rather indifferent treatment , it's not particularly engaging in this case . Incidentally , both stars ? Carroll Baker again and Jean Sorel ? would appear in a number of giallos over the years : the two , in fact , had already made THE SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH ( 1968 ) together and , while the former would make four for Lenzi alone , the latter appeared ( among others ) in two of Lucio Fulci's best films ? one of which , ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER aka PERVERSION STORY ( 1969 ) , was also partly inspired by the aforementioned Clouzot thriller ! Perhaps the most determining factors in PARANOIA's lack of stature are its positively underwhelming credentials ( the film is an Italian / French / Spanish co-production ) ; that said , the glossy look ? particularly in the beautiful widescreen print I viewed ? and Gregorio Garcia Segura's bouncy lounge score easily emerge as its most pleasing ( and durable ) assets . After a fairly dreary first half , the narrative gets pretty complicated , though the many plot twists aren't exactly surprising : one I liked , however , was when the scheme of playboy Sorel's two wives to get rid of him backfires , he's quick to take matters into his own hands and dispose of the current spouse ( which would leave him tremendously wealthy ) there and then ! Even so , a third woman enters the picture soon after ? the daughter of the deceased ( gorgeous if perennially sullen Marina Coffa ) who , then , conspires with him to oust his ex ( Baker ) by elaborately framing her for Sorel's ' murder ' ! The frenzied climax , in fact , sees the distraught heroine's car plunging from a cliff ( she's being chased by the police when Sorel's phantom suddenly ' haunts ' her ) ? but Baker has the last laugh after all as , in the search to find his ' missing ' body , the corpse of Sorel's second bride literally turns up to incriminate him ! Mind you , the film's still quite watchable ? as much for the reasons already stated as for Baker's frequent nude scenes ?
577524	1399158	22119	5.0	MAN OF THE WORLD ( Richard Wallace , 1931 )	The oldest and least entry in the Lombard Collection is this would-be sophisticated melodrama , about ex-journalist con-man William Powell who appears to look out for wealthy Americans vacationing in Paris being blackmailed after having been caught in compromising situations – when he’s really the one behind the whole scheme ( with a couple of associates in tow ) . Lombard ( who subsequently married her co-star ) plays the young niece of one such victim ( Guy Kibbee ) ; this is the earliest of her films that I’ve watched and , frankly , if it weren’t for her voice she’d be unrecognizable from her later zanier output . Here , she’s given a very plain look indistinguishable from many an early 1930s leading lady ; in fact , it was only with her performance as a temperamental theatrical star to John Barrymore’s madcap impresario in Howard Hawks’ magnificent screwball comedy TWENTIETH CENTURY ( 1934 ) that she acquired her distinctive – and captivating – personality . Anyway , the film makes for a mildly interesting artifact due to its unusual plot and setting ( though obviously shot on the Paramount back-lot ) ; Powell’s is actually a thoughtful characterization – but Lombard is merely decorous ( needless to say , I’ve always preferred her in comedy roles as opposed to drama ) . Also in the cast is Wynne Gibson as The ( vindictive and somewhat pathetic ) Other Woman , a role that would practically be replicated wholesale in NIGHT AFTER NIGHT ( 1932 ) which , coincidentally , is included on Universal’s " Mae West Glamour Collection " set ! All in all , however , director Wallace fared much better in his more sympathetic depiction of another band of crooks years later in the winsome comedy THE YOUNG IN HEART ( 1938 ) .
577235	1399158	209377	5.0	HIS DAY OF GLORY ( Edoardo Bruno , 1969 )	Included on the second disc of PARTNER ( 1968 ) , this ' underground ' film ( which actually utilizes outtakes from the Bertolucci film for its pre-credits sequence - when proposed leading man Pierre Clementi proved unavailable due to drug-related problems ! ) was virtually lost to the ravages of time ; still , to be honest , the behind-the-scenes vicissitudes ( described in detail by the director himself in an accompanying interview ) are more interesting than the film itself ! It's just as politically oriented as PARTNER , if not more , but lacks its visual sophistication ( being amateurish in every department ) and , while there's an essential plot ( with the central discussion among radicals of various persuasions being a direct nod to Godard's LA CHINOISE [ 1967 ] ) , the film is tiresomely didactic for the most part ( with a tendency towards discussing Brecht's relevance ) . Two other notable movies which also contain long sequences of political debate between radical students are Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT ( 1970 ) and Peter Watkins ' PUNISHMENT PARK ( 1971 ; which I've recently double-dipped on via Eureka / MoC's R2 SE DVD but have yet to check out the disc ) but I certainly don't recall them being as heavy-going and dreary as they were here . The most engaging performer is Maria Carriho , the female lead - a Portuguese undergoing political exile in Italy who took the subject to heart and eventually became a fully-fledged member of the Parliament of the European Union ! The male lead , intended for Tomas Milian after the Clementi debacle , was actually played by his regular stand-in Raul Martinez , albeit rather stiffly . Philippe Leroy , the only professional cast member , is featured in a brief but important role which has a lot to bear on the film's overextended climax ( which is still , perhaps , its most inspired moment ) . Although the supplements on the No Shame disc feature footage of Lou Castel acting in the film , he also did not play the main role eventually but , disappointingly , there is no further elaboration at all on this from the director in his interview . One does learn , however , that HIS DAY OF GLORY was somehow sent to the Berlin Film Festival over an Elio Petri film - presumably A QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY ( 1969 ) , a remarkable psychological horror opus and an altogether superior offering !
578212	1399158	479002	5.0	CONNECTING ( Dan Turner , 2005 )	Curiously included on a preview DVD I acquired of upcoming 2008 theatrical releases was this winner of a Short Film competition organized by the British magazine " Total Film " . The premise is very simple : a young man on a bus , caught in a traffic jam on a rainy day , is driven up the wall by his fellow passengers’ obsession with cell phones . He cracks up , beats the boy sitting next to him to a pulp , threatens others with a gun , and searches furiously in the other people’s various bags for every offending ringing phone . Eventually , it transpires that all of this is just a dream – except that there is a cellphone ringing , which is bugging the hell out of the remaining passengers on the bus . . . and it’s the protagonist’s ! This is a modest but clever little 6-minute film , with the tight editing its most notable element .
576045	1399158	55578	5.0	URSUS IN THE VALLEY OF THE LIONS ( Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia , 1961 )	Though featuring many an unlikely plot point ( starting off with Ursus as a baby ? even if it was the third of his adventures to be released within the same year ! ) , this emerges as a slightly above-average peplum in which the muscular hero is once again played by the affable Ed Fury . He is the heir to some throne , obviously coveted by the villain of the piece ? Alberto Lupo ? and thus the target of assassination ; amazingly , he not only survives this but is also brought up , Tarzan-like , by a bunch of lions ( hence the title ) . Amusingly , though he seems to have effortlessly mastered the faculty of speech regardless , Ursus is blissfully ignorant of etiquette since he sees nothing wrong in taking a dip into a stream while the protesting ( and obviously annoyed ) heroine ? a girl , intended for a slave market , whom he helps ? is bathing ! Special mention , then , is given in the credits to the animal wrangler involved , Orlando Orfei , presumably a relative of the film's villainess Moira Orfei ( who was actually a staple of such fare : as was the case with the first URSUS , she has to contend with another girl over the love of a man , even if the object of her affection here is Lupo ) . Surprisingly , the film maintains a fairly sober tone throughout ? with little concessions to the genre's usual pitfalls ( there is no insufferable comic relief , for instance ) ? but we still get the villain's unconvincing demise at the hands of Simba , Ursus ' favorite lioness ( elsewhere it also bonds with the heroine's snowy-white mutt ) , and some unintentionally hilarious action scenes : Gerard Herter , Lupo's henchman , is hit squarely on the head with a stone-block the hero has dislodged from his prison-cell and lives ( at least long enough to be devoured by a creepy pack of hungry hyenas ) ; a soldier is thrown into a fire during a scuffle , rises up blazing , trips and falls flat on his face ; a number of soldiers are commissioned to demolish a cave , the meeting-place of rebels , only to end up buried within it themselves , etc . In the end , the film provides standard excitements but proves mildly entertaining nevertheless ( if hardly essential ) ; again like URSUS , we find some notable names among the credits ? not just director Bragaglia but composer Riz Ortolani and assistant director Ruggero Deodato ( ! ) .
577693	1399158	67345	5.0	THE LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD ( Kevin Billington , 1971 )	Having fond memories of watching this as a kid , being one of the first VHS I had gotten hold of ( in the mid-1980s ) , I guess I'm more partial to it than would have otherwise been the case ; a measure of my impatience to revisit this over the years is my having recorded it off of Italian TV , almost acquiring it as DivX and eventually coming across a copy of the Image DVD within the space of a week ! Even so , reviewing the film now with an adult perspective clearly exposes its essentially flawed nature . This was a typical ( and typically misguided ) international venture of the time , adapted from an obscure Jules Verne tale and roping in Hollywood veterans ? Kirk Douglas ( who even produced ! ) and Yul Brynner ? in an effort to drum up sufficient box-office receipts ( this was yet another effort by the Salkinds , who were responsible for SANTA CLAUS [ 1985 ] , another very recent re-acquaintance : by the way , I've just recorded off Italian TV , dubbed and regrettably panned-and-scanned , their star-studded version of Mark Twain's THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER [ 1977 ] ) . Anyway , the film's thin plot of a lighthouse keeper ( Douglas , still athletic at 55 ) combating a band of pirates led by a bored-looking Brynner is stretched for a hefty and slow-moving 129 minutes ( which is 9 longer than the official duration given on most sources ! ) . Even if I hadn't checked this out in 20 years or so , I still recalled some of the imagery involved ? such as Douglas hanging upside down from the lighthouse tower , or his showdown with Brynner ( which ends in a fire ) ? to say nothing of those indelible ( and unmistakably European ) faces , some of whom I've come to know by name in the interim , of Brynner's sinister cutthroat cohorts . The rest of the cast includes Samantha Eggar ( ill-at-ease as a shipwreck victim who unwittingly becomes an object of contention between the two male stars : a sure indication of how perfunctory the role was to begin with is that she's ultimately raped and murdered , with not even the hero bothering to do anything about it ! ) , Renato Salvatori ( as another survivor who befriends Douglas but , when finally caught by Brynner and his men , is painfully skinned alive ! ) , as well as Fernando Rey and popular Italian crooner Massimo Ranieri ? both of whose contribution is brief , being literally done away with as soon as the villains make their first appearance ! While the film's tolerable enough as lowbrow epic adventures go , one can't really call it entertaining in view of the seediness and sadism on display ; that said , the thing does become unintentionally hilarious with the clichéd flashbacks to Douglas ' past as a gold-digger in the Old West , and especially the accidental slipping ( almost at the cost of his life ) of Brynner's wild-eyed , long-haired , right-hand man when engaged in an impromptu campy dance in drag !
577931	1399158	59710	5.0	SHE ( Robert Day , 1965 )	I was looking forward to this Hammer Films color remake of the H . Rider Haggard classic , after having re-acquainted myself with the fine 1935 black-and-white version last year . I was also glad to be able to get another Peter Cushing / Christopher Lee collaboration under my belt : this was , in fact , followed by another - Dracula A . D . 1972 ( 1972 ) - but , alas , both films turned out to be duds ! Even if it retains the desert setting of the novel ( whereas the earlier version had transposed the narrative to the Arctic , albeit effectively ) , the film doesn't capture the imagination of the audience , so to speak , and emerges a dullish venture overall . Indeed , even the Hammer stalwarts - Cushing , Lee and composer James Bernard - seem uninspired by the material and their individual contribution is surprisingly below-par ! To make matters worse , the two stars were largely relegated to the sidelines to make way for the insipid three-way romance comprising Ursula Andress , John Richardson and Rosenda Monteros ( though the girls , at least , constitute undeniable eye-candy ) . Having just viewed THE CREEPING FLESH ( 1973 ) , I appreciated Cushing's healthier-looking appearance here - though the Dracula film , needless to say , brought me back to his impossibly gaunt physique which resulted from the untimely death of his beloved wife ! ; as for Lee , ridiculously decked with a beehive-shaped headset during the climactic scenes , he was obviously the villain of the piece . The cast also featured Bernard Cribbins as Cushing and Richardson's companion / servant and a bare-chested ( ! ) Andre ' Morell as Monteros ' father . Despite having previously helmed two Boris Karloff horror vehicles - GRIP OF THE STRANGLER ( 1958 ) and CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( 1958 ; which also featured Lee ) , both of which I've yet to catch up with myself { where are those rumored Criterion / Eclipse SE DVDs ? } - this was Robert Day's only film for the Hammer stable , and it's easy to see why !
578126	1399158	63665	5.0	SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL ( Jean-Luc Godard , 1968 )	This " meeting " of two of the finest artists of the 20th Century - Jean-Luc Godard and The Rolling Stones - is truly a missed opportunity . The footage of the band recording their landmark song ( probably my favorite Stones track ) is certainly fascinating , as we watch the initially slow musical accompaniment for the song taking shape and metamorphose into the energetic , percussion-heavy final version we're familiar with . Sadly , it's also quite apparent here that Brian Jones ( who sits in his booth playing his acoustic guitar , rarely communicating with his bandmates except to ask for a cigarette and eventually disappearing altogether in the second half of the film ) was slipping away fast . Unfortunately for us viewers , Godard ( in full-blown " political activist " mode ) unwisely intersperses the recording sessions with lots of boring stuff featuring militant black people spouting " Black Power " philosophy in a junkyard , white political activists reading their " sacred " texts in a book shop while members of the general public are made to slap two of their comrades and give the Nazi salute and , most embarrassingly of all perhaps , Godard's current wife , Anne Wiazemsky ( playing Eve Democracy ! ) is seen being followed by a camera crew in a field and asked the most obtuse " topical " questions imaginable to which she merely answers in the affirmative or the negative ! As if this wasn't enough , the film has undoubtedly the murkiest soundtrack I've ever had the misfortune to hear ( so that I often had to rely on the forced Italian subtitles present on the VHS copy I was watching ) and I'd bet that even Robert Altman would have objected to Godard's occasional overlapping on the soundtrack of the Stones recording , the Black Power spoutings , an anonymous narrator reading a ( mercifully ) hilarious pulp novel , etc . For some inexplicable reason then , the film ends on a beach where an unidentified film crew is filming a battle sequence ! ! Godard's original intention was to not include the song " Sympathy For The Devil " in its entirety and when producer Ian Quarrier overruled him , he jumped up on London's National Film Theater stage following a screening of the film and knocked him out ! Godard's version , entitled ONE PLUS ONE , is also available on a double-feature R2 DVD including both cuts of the film but it's highly unlikely that I'll be bothering with it any time soon . . .
576592	1399158	83659	6.0	BLOOD LINK ( Alberto De Martino , 1982 )	This obscure Italian film ? made in the English language ? mixes typical elements of the giallo with a few sci-fi trappings , and adds to them a doppelganger theme . Incidentally , given that it deals with Siamese twins who haven't been in contact for years but are able to ' see ' what one another is doing , it somehow feels like the long-lost sibling of two Brian De Palma films itself ? coming , as it does , in between his SISTERS ( 1973 ) and RAISING CAIN ( 1992 ) ! Anyway , it's mildly interesting ( even more so for me , being a twin myself ! ) , good-looking ( the film was shot in the U . S . and Germany ) and features an understated Ennio Morricone score ? but , in the long run , emerges as nothing especially remarkable . Besides , even if the supporting cast is decked out with veteran presences ? Geraldine Fitzgerald , Virginia McKenna and Cameron Mitchell ? they're all basically wasted ( McKenna , for instance , is already dead within the first 5 minutes ! ) . The lead is played by Michael Moriarty , an actor noted for his intense performances ? and , here , we get double the dose ( with the star , predictably , hamming it up particularly in his serial-killer characterization ) ! However , he's flanked by two lovely ladies whose contribution is above-average for this sort of thing ? Penelope Milford ( ex-Oscar nominee for COMING HOME [ 1978 ] ! ) as the good Moriarty's girlfriend and Sarah Langenfeld ( in one of only 4 films she did ) as the daughter of has-been prizefighter Mitchell , whose cold-blooded murder at the hands of the bad Moriarty she witnesses . By the way , the film features a surprising amount of nudity ( by the two girls and others ) ? but it's not done in an overly sleazy or exploitative manner . The ' face / off ' situations between the two brothers provide the expected fireworks ; the climax , then , sees Milford distracting the villainous ( and impotent ) Moriarty by letting him rape her ? thus enabling the police to track him down through his brother's ability to recognize the surroundings ! This is followed , however , by a far-fetched CARRIE ( 1976 ) - like twist set in the city morgue . . . but which leads to an effectively unsettling ' curtain ' where Milford is literally unable to tell which brother she's ended up with ! P . S . If all goes well , I should be getting to another of De Martino's horror films ? HOLOCAUST 2000 ( 1977 ) ? in the near future , which is one I've missed out on numerous times in the past . . .
575974	1399158	61324	6.0	OPERATION ST . PETER'S ( Lucio Fulci , 1967 )	This is yet another caper in the broadly comic style of the classic BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET ( 1958 ) ; actually , it's a semi-sequel to Dino Risi's THE TREASURE OF SAN GENNARO ( 1966 ) ? via the presence in both of three incompetent thieves ( the movie opens with them drilling through the floor of a building , believing it will lead into a museum but they find themselves inside a prison cell where the hero is currently confined ! ) . Besides , it's one of numerous films in this vein which populated Edward G . Robinson's latter-day career ; one further link to an earlier film is the fact that a previous " James Tont " adventure with the same star , Lando Buzzanca ? which I watched recently ? also involved a theft from the Vatican ( the " St . Peter's " of the title ) . Incidentally , the " Operation " isn't the actual robbery itself ? which , committed on the spur of the moment by Buzzanca in a totally casual manner ( making off with Michelangelo's Pieta ' statue on a fork-lifter in broad daylight ! ) , is treated almost like child's play by director Fulci ( well-known for his anti-clerical views ) ? but rather the ultra-organized ecclesiastical retrieval of the missing item ( which , at one point , is even compared to the work of the Mafia ) ! In fact , we see various priests doing incredible stunts on motor-bikes ( ! ) and such ? which renders the second half of this patchy offering agreeably irreverent . Still , there are a few undeniable belly-laughs : when Buzzanca is forced to confess the crime to a priest by his girlfriend ( they met during a failed " snatch & grab " attempt and with whom she fell immediately in love , since he happens to be a dead-ringer for her late husband ! ) , we hear the man in the confessional tumbling down from fainting ; another is when the trio of crooks are discovered lying about in their hide-out by Buzzanca and a Cardinal ( Heinz Ruhmann ) ? the statue is no longer there , so they think that the men had been murdered by Robinson's gang : however , they had only passed out from over-eating ( given them in exchange for the Pieta ' ! ) , not having had a decent meal in some time ? and , in fact , one of them wakes up just in time to burp vigorously and loudly ! ! ; also , during the lengthy climactic chase , a car with two priests inside is bumped into by another vehicle and torn in half ! ; also , among the parties to set out in pursuit of the thieves , are a group of laid-back and constantly chanting monks who use a derelict truck for the journey ? so that , when they finally arrive on the scene , the operation has just wrapped ! Robinson is given a nice role as a former big shot , but who cracked after being beaten up by his own cronies ( he now flicks between a semi-senile nature and his former bloodthirsty self ! ) ; incidentally , it was rather strange to watch the Hollywood veteran in the presence of scantily-clad female assistant Uta Levka ! Reportedly , Fulci was unimpressed by the actor's legacy and seems to have had had little patience with Robinson when the latter couldn't remember his lines ( incidentally , the director didn't even have a kind word for his own film ? calling it " a piece of crap " ) ! Anyway , also notable in the cast is Jean-Claude Brialy , appearing atypically as a speech-impaired Sicilian ( ! ) stud : though married , he uses his dubious skills as crooner to seduce ( and , consequently , live off ) every rich old lady that crosses his path !
577974	1399158	61376	6.0	THE LAST ADVENTURE ( Robert Enrico , 1967 )	Out of an Alain Delon three-film marathon , this was the one I was most looking forward to but , surprisingly , ended up being the most disappointing . The fact that the Italian TV broadcast suffered from intermittent instances of bad reception had a lot to do with this , I guess , but I also found the film ( which was adapted from a novel by crime expert Jose ' Giovanni , dealing with a search for treasure lost at sea ) rather an inconsequential trifle ! Still , the proceedings are considerably bolstered by attractive locations , the delectable Joanna Shimkus ( even if her character , who hitches with stars Delon and Lino Ventura far too quickly , is killed off half-way through ) and Francois de Roubaix's delightful score . Delon ? playing a dashing , reckless flier ? is his typically inexpressive self , but Ventura is as strong as ever as his inventor / racing-car enthusiast partner ; also notable is Serge Reggiani as a nervous yet shifty hanger-on who eventually reveals the exact whereabouts of the crashed airplane in which the loot is stashed . Incidentally , the abandoned fortress in mid-ocean ( Shimkus dreams of owning it , but which is eventually purchased by Ventura after her demise with his share of the recovered fortune ) is a great setting ? which director Enrico ably employs for the film's action climax ( even if the gangsters who assault Ventura and Delon , who are also after the money , make for a bunch of anonymous villains ) .
576190	1399158	52309	6.0	TOTO ' , PEPPINO E LE FANATICHE ( Mario Mattoli , 1958 )	As with many films of its era , this is a satire on the Italian " boom " and the nth pairing of its star duo - which generally made for an assured pleasant diversion . Toto ' and Peppino are henpecked husbands who are driven off the wall by their respective families ' obsession with progress and end up in an asylum , giving way to various amusing flashbacks to their domestic and professional mishaps . The film's last third is devoted to a gala night , highlighting popular musical talent of the period ; actually , crooner / actor Johnny Dorelli is featured as the secondary lead ( playing Peppino's son ) - who , naturally , falls for Toto''s daughter . . .
575975	1399158	83906	6.0	EUREKA ( Nicolas Roeg , 1983 )	Despite intermittent evidence of Roeg's usual quality , this film can be seen as the beginning of his decline : it's interesting , certainly ambitious but , ultimately , unsatisfying . Surprisingly enough , it's not as cryptic as the director's earlier work though still not for all tastes ( particularly given an irrelevant voodoo dance sequence involving a snake-infested orgy ) . The script is by ex-film critic Paul Mayersberg who had already written THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH ( 1976 ) for Roeg . The film , which could comfortably be divided into three parts , is aided by a plethora of talent both in front - Gene Hackman , Theresa Russell , Rutger Hauer , Jane Lapotaire , Ed Lauter , Mickey Rourke , Joe Pesci and Joe Spinell ( a bit part as a thug ) - and behind the camera ( cinematographer Alex Thompson and composer Stanley Myers ) . The first part , in which Hackman strikes it rich , is the best with two scenes that are particularly memorable : a despairing prospector blowing his head off in front of Hackman and , then , when the latter discovers the gold mine - an almost mystical sequence ; however , one still has to contend with Helena Kallianotes ' eccentric performance as a fortune teller / whore who befriends Hackman . The second part , in which we see Hackman twenty years on as a tycoon with a family - all-powerful but emotionally void : this section creates some added tension with Hackman's clashes with playboy Hauer ( who marries his daughter , Russell , without her father's consent ) and unscrupulous business partners Pesci and Rourke , and culminates with his violent death ( quite a graphic sequence , occurring about 80 minutes into the 130-minute picture ! ) at the hands of the latters ' thugs . The third and final part , then , involving Hauer's trial for Hackman's murder is the least compelling - given the latter's obvious absence , but also the silly contrivances which dominate this section ( and particularly the preposterous scene of Russell's hysterics on the witness stand , with Hauer acting as his own defense attorney ! ) . EUREKA was shot in 1981 but the company that financed it couldn't make head or tail of it and decided to shelve the film ; eventually , it was released in the U . K . in 1983 ( I own a copy of the " Movies & Video " magazine from that time , which carries a reasonably favorable review of the film ) and , according to " Leonard Maltin's Film Guide " , didn't open in the U . S . until 1985 !
576756	1399158	34902	6.0	Invisible Agent ( 1942 )	Of the " Invisible Man " series made by Universal , I was only familiar with the first two ( both of which I'll rewatch again presently ) - the James Whale original being one of my all-time favorites . Ever since it was released as part of the " Legacy " set , I had mostly read negative opinions about this film - and even Leonard Maltin gives it a pretty low rating . However , I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it ! True , the leads are rather bland ( why on earth is Ilona Massey credited before Jon Hall ? ! ) but , then , INVISIBLE AGENT has a formidable trio of villains - Peter Lorre , Sir Cedric Hardwicke and J . Edward Bromberg - going for it ( who even make Curt Siodmak's script sound better than it is ) . Besides , I must say that I'm a sucker for both WWII and espionage movies , so that's a big plus as well . . . which , I guess , means that it isn't really a horror film and that The Invisible Man is the hero ! Oh well , you can't have everything ! John P . Fulton's still-impressive special effects ( exposed a bit here by the extra clarity of the DVD transfer ) deliver the goods and , all in all , the film made me keen to get to the remaining titles in the series .
577829	1399158	39595	6.0	MAGIC TOWN ( William A . Wellman , 1947 )	Written and produced by frequent Frank Capra collaborator Robert Riskin and starring the director's three-time leading man James Stewart , one would be excused for mistaking this for a film by the celebrated purveyor of socially-conscious comedies . However , while the plot is typically original and engaging , somehow it lacks Capra's unique cinematic expertise in putting over Riskin's ideas : the tone is too often syrupy and sentimental , while the hero isn't made to face formidable villains such as one finds in Capra's work . Even if director Wellman was more at home in outdoor actioners , he often displayed a social side and , for the record , had previously triumphed in two classic films set in contemporary times ? namely the original version of A STAR IS BORN and the screwball comedy NOTHING SACRED ( 1937 ) . Stewart is a poll expert who believes that one city in the U . S . could be deemed the reference point as to how the whole nation thinks and feels about all aspects of life ? its aspirations , trends , political views , etc . His report leads him to settle on the small Midwestern town of Grandview which , however , is on the point of modernizing itself ( via a project bequeathed to local reporter Jane Wyman by her father ) . This would , doubtless , affect the idealized image being promoted by Stewart of Grandview as the prototypical American town with its simple way of life , so he manipulates the populace ( without letting them on to his line of work ) into opposing Wyman's scheme ! This doesn't prevent the two from falling in love ? a romance which ends , though , when she overhears him speaking to his superior in New York ; distraught , she exposes his racket ? but , in so doing , brings a whole circus of ' prospectors ' and newshounds upon Grandview ? so that the next poll turns out to be a disaster , and the town is disgraced ! Stewart is dismayed by all of this ; however , he keeps in touch with the people of Grandview ( the kids especially had learned to look up to him in view of his basketball prowess ! ) and , of course , Wyman . Eventually , he hits upon the idea that a pompous statement made earlier ( but which remained unpublished ) by the highest authorities in Grandview that , if necessary , they'll erect the proposed civic centre with their own hands could be used now to symbolize the town's determination to re-emerge ? An RKO production , the film also features such reliable performers as Ned Sparks and Donald Meek as Stewart's associates , Kent Smith as a Grandview professor and ex-school chum of Stewart's , and Wallace Ford as one of the eminent townspeople .
576510	1399158	64639	6.0	MAROONED ( John Sturges , 1969 )	Amazingly , this was begun by none other than Frank Capra but the Hollywood veteran – who would subsequently make no more films – was replaced when his requested budget could not be met by Columbia ( though the services of his son as Associate Producer were somehow retained ) ; however , the studio then seemed more acquiescent when John Sturges came on board – given that the picture ended up exceeding the initially proposed budget by some $5 million ! Actually , Sturges had just come from another epic where the protagonists spend much of the time in a cramped environment , i . e . the submarine in ICE STATION ZEBRA ( 1968 ) ; this one , being based on real events and revolving around the novel space program rather than the tired Cold War formula of the Alistair MacLean adventure thriller , was a more significant undertaking – but the end result is nowhere near as entertaining ! The film is both solemn and cold : as expected , it’s meticulously detailed – down to the irritating over-use of up-to-date jargon such as ‘So-and-so systems Are Go’ , ‘Roger’ , ‘Wilco’ , etc . Incidentally , while the presence of an all-star cast may have boosted its box-office potential ( for the record MAROONED came hot on the heels of Stanley Kubrick’s even more bewildering but , ultimately , far more entrancing 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY [ 1968 ] ) , it distracts from the unfolding drama : Gregory Peck’s constricted role of the seasoned but stoic overseer would become a staple of 1970s disaster epics – here , he’s the head of the program who has to decide what to do when a shuttle’s re-entry fire malfunctions and the three-man astronaut crew is stranded in space ( MAROONED can then be seen as the APOLLO 13 [ 1995 ] of its day , though the particular mission that film depicts would only occur in 1970 ! ) . An ex-colleague of theirs now employed in the Control Room ( David Janssen ) is the only one who believes that a rescue mission is possible in the restricted time-frame before the oxygen supply runs out ; in fact , Peck has to be prodded by the U . S . President himself to take the challenge during a fairly risible sequence in which , distraught by the precarious situation he’s facing , Peck’s also pulled over on a highway by a couple of cops for over-speeding – even so , this remote chance is almost lost when the launch site is beset by a hurricane ! The astronauts are well enough played by Richard Crenna , a hysterical Gene Hackman and James Franciscus – all of whom have wives and kids back home anxiously awaiting the resolution of their fate ; when they’re given the chance to talk to them towards the end , the conversations are predictably awkward and touching . In fact , this latter section is the one that generates the most interest and suspense – especially when a Russian spacecraft turns up during the delicate transfer of two of the men ( one has opted to sacrifice himself for the sake of the others ) to the rescue vessel . Unfortunately , one of the film’s trump cards back in 1969 – its Oscar-winning special effects – haven’t worn well the passage of time , being exposed by the extra clarity of the DVD transfer ; however , this takes nothing away from the splendid cinematography by Sturges regular Daniel Fapp . One final thing : while the movie’s official length is given as 134 minutes , the version I watched ran for only 124 ( in PAL mode ) ; taking into consideration the different frame-rate when played in NTSC , it would still leave about five minutes unaccounted for – which I take to be an " Intermission " card , or some such addendum during its theatrical run , which wasn’t included here .
576639	1399158	70121	6.0	GODSPELL ( David Greene , 1973 )	My first viewing ( in a Pan-and-Scan version ) of this one had left me underwhelmed - recorded off Cable TV , I had subsequently erased the tape - and , so , I decided to give it another chance via Columbia's bare-bones DVD . I have to say that the overall impression hasn't changed much the second time around : still , the film ( and show ) is perhaps unjustly overshadowed by the contemporaneous - but more focused and , therefore , more crowd-pleasing - Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR ( 1973 ) . The songs by Stephen Schwarz are pretty good , with the best numbers among them - " Prepare Ye The Way Of The Lord " , " Day By Day " and " Finale " - possessing a decidedly haunting quality . Besides , their staging ( shot on location in New York City , with much prominence given to the World Trade Center ! ) is undeniably energetic ; the confrontation with a tin monster ( standing in for the Pharisees ) is particularly inspired . There are also some unexpected cinematic references here : the " Slowly I Turned " Abbott & Costello routine , the song " Turn Back , O Man " delivered in the tawdry style of Mae West and , most amusing of all , the parable of the Prodigal Son shown via a collage of footage from various unidentified Silent films ! What hasn't aged well are the various hippie / ethnic characterizations on display ( including an insipid and curly-haired Christ ! ) , with their mostly silly antics - amid re-enactments of episodes from St . Matthew's Gospel - rendering the film's pacing uneven to say the least . . .
576686	1399158	25688	6.0	PUNCH DRUNKS ( Lou Breslow , 1934 )	Pretty much on the same level of WOMAN HATERS ( 1934 ) , though without the rhyming dialogue ; ironically , the style of comedy seen here seems like a dry run for later Abbott & Costello efforts ( with the comical prizefighting bout recalling that duo’s 1951 meeting with The Invisible Man ) ! Again , The Stooges consider female companionship as irresistible but essentially intrusive ; Moe slaps his buddies around so often that one wonders whether anyone got hurt during the making of these films ! An interesting twist here is that Curly’s combative skill is triggered by the playing of " Pop Goes The Weasel " ; predictably , Larry’s playing of the song on his violin is made impossible during the decisive fight when Curly falls on top of him from the ring – thus causing Larry to run out of the arena to search for possible replacements ( first coming up with a radio and then a truck fitted with a loudspeaker , which he drives through the walls of the building ) !
577657	1399158	57007	6.0	DONOVAN'S REEF ( John Ford , 1963 )	Brawling , leisurely-paced comedy with an island setting : typical of director Ford in its plethora of colorful characters and occasional sentimentality , but is actually a heavy-handed attempt at the Howard Hawks style ( as displayed most recently in another John Wayne vehicle , HATARI ! [ 1962 ] - which I've just learned , via the McLINTOCK ! [ 1963 ] Audio Commentary , was critic Leonard Maltin's favorite film growing up ! ) ; this is most evident in the love-hate relationship between the Wayne and Elizabeth Allen characters . Despite a stalwart cast , all performers are basically operating below-par ( Lee Marvin's co-star credit isn't really justified , Dorothy Lamour's role is insignificant , while Jack Warden is not only too young to play Allen's father but too ' modern ' to fit in this company ! ) . All in all , it's a harmless but disappointing swansong for one of cinema's most famous and durable director-actor teams ; pity they didn't part company with the elegiac THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE ( 1962 ) - also featuring Marvin - which preceded it !
577568	1399158	140588	6.0	NAZI LOVE CAMP 27 ( Mario Caiano , 1977 )	This is one of the more infamous of the countless Nazisploitation Italian films produced in the wake of Luchino Visconti's THE DAMNED ( 1969 ) ; actually , it's the only one I've watched thus far - though earlier this year I did catch up with Liliana Cavani's THE NIGHT PORTER ( 1974 ) but , like the Visconti film , that one is best termed as Art-house . Still , for such a single-mindedly commercial effort , I was surprised by how effective this film was : after all , it was made by all-rounded professionals who had been in the business for some time - director Caiano ( best-known , perhaps , for the Barbara Steele Gothic horror NIGHTMARE CASTLE aka THE FACELESS MONSTER [ 1965 ] ) and screenwriter Gianfranco Clerici and composer Francesco De Masi ( both Lucio Fulci collaborators ) . The lead role here is played by Sirpa Lane , with whom I was only familiar from Walerian Borowczyk's legendary THE BEAST ( 1975 ) : as much as I love that film , I had always felt that her contribution was upstaged not just by the horny and furry titular creature but by the nominal lead of THE BEAST , Lisbeth Hummel . Therefore , I had no idea that she could actually act and , indeed , the whole film is anchored by her good central performance ; discovered by Roger Vadim , she subsequently worked with a few other noted " Euro-Cult " film-makers - but eventually retired ( after making only 10 films ) and , sadly , died of AIDS at the young age of 44 ! The plot sees Jewess Lane being imprisoned in a concentration camp ( thus adding the ' Women-In-Prison ' subgenre to the already heady mix for good measure - in fact , the film reminded me a lot of Jess Franco's contemporaneous ILSA , THE WICKED WARDEN [ 1977 ] ) , where she's immediately raped and later selected by a lesbian warden ( apparently a given in WIP films ) to serve as a prostitute for the gratification of German soldiers on leave . About to be flogged for rejecting the advances of the warden , she attracts the attention of the Camp Commandant and eventually starts a sado-masochistic relationship with him ( he frequently asks her to whip him , likes to exchange clothes with her and even wants Lane to pleasure his faithful alsation Axel - but the latter doesn't seem too keen on the idea and promptly attacks her ) ! ! The finale sees the Jewish girl elevated to the position of a madam in a Nazi whorehouse ; the man she was in love with at the beginning of the film suddenly turns up at the establishment as a war hero - but it all ends in tragedy ( though not before Lane , her Semitic origins exposed , jokes about Hitler's unemployed ' member ' ! ) . I have to say , though , that the gimmick adopted throughout of intercutting black-and-white stock footage with the main action was rather pointless because , although the events are clearly set in 1942 , we are never told where all this is supposed to be happening so that said footage could be put into perspective ! I watched the film ( which is still unavailable anywhere on DVD ) via a DVD-R culled from an English-dubbed VHS edition ; I don't know whether it's uncut as the editing seemed quite choppy at times - but the amount of violence and nudity on display was certainly profuse ( the former pretty fake but the latter rather graphic , occasionally even stepping into hardcore-porn territory ) . . .
576580	1399158	69715	6.0	. . . AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS ! ( Roy Ward Baker , 1973 )	I remember being underwhelmed when I first watched this ( a pan & scan airing on TV some years ago ) , but re-acquainting myself with it via Anchor Bay UK's exemplary DVD edition has proved surprisingly enjoyable - despite its utter lack of originality ! Being Amicus ' sole foray into full-blown Gothic horror , this film perhaps draws the most comparisons with the ' rival ' Hammer films , and as such manages to keep its own in their company by virtue of its polished ( if not expensive ) production values - Denys Coop's intricate camera-work , Douglas Gamley's atmospheric score and Tony Curtis ' handsome sets - and its top cast , comprised of any number of renowned genre stars . Stephanie Beacham ( who screams and faints like the best of them ! ) actually manages to keep the audience involved in her plight , which is no easy feat seeing that precious little of the plot is revealed during its first half ; Ian Ogilvy is an adequately brooding master-of-the house ; Geoffrey Whitehead is a mysterious and vaguely sinister woodsmen who lives on the property ( actually doubling as his own grandfather in the flashback sequence towards the end ) ; Guy Rolfe and Rosalie Crutchley have small but fairly important roles in support . However , the film belongs to three thespians and it seems that the producers knew this as well , given they were top-billed : Peter Cushing , whose belated arrival does not disguise the fact that he's the true star of the show ( nothing new for him here , really , but he's always worth watching ) ; Herbert Lom as a particularly nasty descendant of Ogilvy's and whose misdemeanors have put a terrible curse over the entire house ; Patrick Magee as the compassionate but eventually weak-willed town medic ( who's regrettably thrown to the sidelines and eventually dispatched once Cushing , who's of a more analytical approach , arrives on the scene ) . The film features a number of effective moments : the hand bursting out of the painting ; the many scenes involving the crawling hand ( though a rather tired motif by now , especially since it was not a part of the original novel ! ) ; likewise , the many appearances of Whitehead's disfigured and spooky ancestor ; the all-important flashback involving Lom's character ( basically lifted outright from Conan Doyle's " The Hound Of The Baskervilles " ) which , apart from brutal ( if not too graphic ) rape and symbolic mutilation , also features some brief nudity - unless I'm mistaken , a first for Amicus ( in contrast , Beacham's violation by the ' ghost ' is presented in a lot subtler way which , by the end , only led to confusion for some viewers as to what had really happened to her ! ) ; the finale is quite interesting for this type of film ( though , again , hardly ground-breaking in the broader scheme of things ) : Ogilvy going mad a ' la WITCHFINDER GENERAL ( 1968 ) and literally digging up his grandfather's corpse while Beacham , equally unhinged by this time , is perplexed by the presence of her new-born child who may or may not be ' possessed ' ( echoes of ROSEMARY'S BABY [ 1968 ] ) - the sight of Cushing presiding over this scene and realizing that all his ' enlightened ' advise has brought only misery upon the couple lends the whole a rare ( and probably unwitting ) poignancy . With respect to the video / audio department , Anchor Bay UK handles this area of the disc satisfactorily . The Audio Commentaries are the icing on the cake for this release - two excellent tracks that take in everything one would possibly want to know about the production , including the fact that all seemingly agree on the singularly unbecoming retitling of the film by producer Max J . Rosenberg , and then some ( Ogilvy comes off as a very pleasant chap who looks back at his days in horror cinema with great fondness , though he continually underestimates his own memory of them ! ; Stephanie Beacham and Roy Ward Baker seem very glad to be once again in each other's company while also evidently very proud of their respective work here ; moderators Darren Gross and Marcus Hearn , respectively , come up with relevant questions and general factoids so that both tracks remain , ahem , on track for the most part ) . Finally , there are film notes , bios , a trailer , some TV spots and a poster / stills gallery which , as with the other discs in this Collection , add up to a very nice extra touch .
577633	1399158	65922	6.0	JULIUS CAESAR ( Stuart Burge , 1970 )	This second big-screen attempt at Shakespeare's play is pretty much neglected in the face of the lavish ( despite being in black-and-white ) and acclaimed 1953 MGM version . A number of cinematic adaptations of The Bard's work had been made in the interim , but the Roman Empire setting and concluding battle sequence seemed ideal at a time of big-budget , star-studded epics . That said , the film under review is noted as being " technically ragged " and has even been likened to a peplum ! I had initially balked at the prospect of adding this to my collection in view of the fact that both existing DVD editions are only available in a full-frame format ; still , I changed my mind so that I could include it in my Charlton Heston tribute . When I was in Hollywood , I had watched another Shakespearean film adaptation from the same director ? OTHELLO ( 1965 ) , with Laurence Olivier ; I recall being somewhat underwhelmed by it ? coming across as excessively stagy and , therefore , uninventive compared to Orson Welles ' highly cinematic rendition from 1952 ( though it may also have been due to the massive length , 166 minutes , of Burge's take on that celebrated play ) . At 116 minutes , JULIUS CAESAR is a more manageable enterprise and , as I said , at least it ' opens up ' towards the end ; besides , its gripping narrative of political machinations is among Shakespeare's more compelling . Which brings us to a comparison of the 1953 and 1970 versions : if there's one thing that could be leveled against the former is that it flaunts the trademark MGM gloss ? plus the fact that it was determined to have a star in even the rather negligible female roles ( Greer Garson as Calpurnia and Deborah Kerr as Portia ) , not so much because they were right for the part but because it would have added to the marquee / prestige value or , more crudely , the budget could afford it ! Otherwise , that film is distinguished by Marlon Brando's fiery Mark Antony , James Mason's thoughtful Brutus and John Gielgud's wily Cassius ? not to mention Miklos Rozsa's typically grandiose score . While the 1970 film adds color and a wider aspect ratio ( somewhat negated here by the disappointing panning-and-scanning of the image ) to benefit the spectacular elements of the plot , and the casting itself looks pretty impressive on paper , it can't really hold a candle to the earlier version ! Charlton Heston is decent as Antony : he had already played the character in a 1950 TV adaptation and would do so again in the 1972 ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA ? based on another Shakespeare play and which he personally directed ( I know this latter film was shown a couple of times in my childhood , including a Sunday matinée ' broadcast on local TV but I'm damned if I recall whether I had sat throughout its entire 170-minute running-time , or even if the print was that long to begin with ; inexplicably , the film seems to have vanished off the face of the earth since then ! ) . In any case , Heston's by-now established larger-than-life persona is enough to carry the weight of the role , and he does especially well in the pivotal oratory at Caesar's funeral ? whilst lacking the essential brooding passion that had marked Brando's earlier portrayal . Jason Robards Jr . is a notoriously glum Brutus ? seemingly uncertain as to how approach the text , his resultant feeble performance truly hurts the overall effort . Richard Johnson , on the other hand , is a fine Cassius : ironically , the fury displayed by him at Brutus ' decision to allow Antony to speak on behalf of Caesar in front of the people is that more palpable here in the wake of Robards ' ineffectual Brutus ! John Gielgud exchanges Cassius's robes from the 1953 film for those of the titular figure ? a legendary interpreter of The Bard's work , he offers a dignified portrayal of the fated conqueror / dictator with a misplaced trust in his peers . Robert Vaughn is a surprisingly good Casca , perhaps Cassius ' closest supporter ; Richard Chamberlain is Octavian , Antony's ally in routing the conspirators ? he only turns up in the last third , with his best moment coming during the confrontation on horseback ( flanked by Antony himself ) with Cassius and Brutus at Philippi . Diana Rigg as Portia has just one scene alongside her husband , Brutus , but the future Dame clearly outshines the miscast Robards ! ; Jill Bennett appears as the superstitious Calpurnia . Christopher Lee , who receives fairly prominent billing , has only a very negligible role ? as a citizen ( mystic ? ) whose advice to Caesar to be wary of his flatterers goes tragically unheeded ? but it was nonetheless nice to see him in this company ; Michael Gough , a horror icon in his own right , is another of Caesar's envious senators determined to bring him down for the good of the Empire ; Andre ' Morell plays Cicero ? his character is often mentioned but the actor's silent contribution is completely redundant , since he only appears in a couple of brief shots ! The opening sequence ? a sinister panorama of a battlefield strewn with rotting corpses and vultures hovering above ? is striking ( this is surprisingly followed by one instance of nudity amid the footage serving as background to the credits ! ) and the finale notches up a few acceptable bouts of action , but the rest of it is generally uninspiring . For the record , I've watched numerous straight adaptations of Shakespeare's work over the years ( beginning from a fairly young age ) ; of late , however , I've become wary of them because of the considerable effort required to get attuned to his idiosyncratic style of writing ? and , even if I was already familiar with this particular play via numerous viewings of the 1953 film , it sadly proved to be no exception to the rule here either ?
576701	1399158	52964	6.0	MAGNIFICENT SINNER ( Robert Siodmak , 1959 )	Following his 11-year tenure in Hollywood between 1941 and 1952 , expatriate German director Siodmak decided to return to Europe ; he would subsequently contrive to make three more English-language films , even if they weren’t up to his best work in the States – but , then , neither was the ‘foreign’ stuff . This costumer ( a remake of a 1938 film by Maurice Tourneur ) is a German / French co-production : it’s a good-looking if stilted melodrama involving impossible love in the Russian court of Alexander II ( Curd Jurgens ) ; with an ailing wife , he draws his amorous attention to a proud teenage beauty ( Romy Schneider ) . Their romance , however , is likely to throw the already troubled Czarist rule ( by the activities of a group of terrorists seeking more humane laws ) into turmoil ; he himself mistrusts his ministers , but they in their turn are willing to collaborate with the ‘enemy’ in order to put a stop to Jurgens and Schneider’s love – which is giving the Empire a bad name thus threatening their own position ! In fact , during the course of the film , we are witness to no fewer than four attempts on the Czar’s life – which is a bit much , if you ask me ; nevertheless , it’s in scenes like these where we get a glimpse of the old Siodmak ( he was one of the finest exponents of Film Noir ) : the film’s most creative bit of direction is Siodmak’s decision to refrain from showing a duel but rather concentrate on the snow-covered trees nearby and only cutting to the bloodied body ( Katia’s officer brother who was defending her honor ! ) once the shots are heard on the soundtrack . The revolutionaries themselves – led by future Claude Chabrol regular Michel Bouquet – are typically depicted as desperate men ( and women ) rather than villainous ( a fate reserved for the Ministers , though they’re actually more pitiful and misguided in their own self-importance than truly evil ) ; the ultimate irony is that Jurgens had always been sympathetic to the terrorists’ cause , but the burden of tradition and a whole set of events ( such as the release of the rebels’ imprisoned friends , promised them by the Emperor via Katia , seen as an act of betrayal when the Ministers arrange for the ex-convicts to be gunned down soon after ) eventually seal his fate . . . just as , with the Empress dead , Schneider was about to take her place on the throne by his side ! For the record , the impossibly young Schneider had actually risen to stardom with a similar Ruritanian i . e . quasi fairy-tale role – that of Princess Sissi in a series of three Austrian films made between 1955 and 1957 ; as for Jurgens , I have his second of two Michel Strogoff films ( made in 1956 and 1961 ) recorded , as was this one , off Italian TV awaiting its turn to be watched . Finally , given KATIA’s silly U . S . retitling , one shouldn’t confuse it with an earlier Siodmak picture from his Hollywood days – THE GREAT SINNER ( 1949 ) which , incidentally , was also a period piece about Russians ( adapted , as a matter of fact , from Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s " The Gambler " ) .
577501	1399158	52924	6.0	Fritz Lang's Indian Epic	I was wary of purchasing Fantoma's 2-Disc Set of " Fritz Lang's Indian Epic " after being somewhat let down by the 1921 Silent original ( co-scripted by Lang himself ) and also its less-than-stellar reputation . For this reason , when the second part of the saga turned up on Italian TV a couple of years ago , I decided to check it out just the same so as to get an inkling of what to expect ! I recall thinking it pretty kitschy and unworthy of Lang's enormous talent , but Fantoma's sale ( through their website ) of their entire DVD catalog a few months back made it an irresistible acquisition ! Well , having now watched the entire saga ( with dialogue and in color , as opposed to the rather static Silent version directed by Joe May - although hearing the Indian-garbed characters talking in German took some getting used to ) , I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely engaging and sheerly enjoyable it all was ! Though it was sold as an epic production ( to the point of concluding ESCHNAPUR with the promise that Part II would feature greater thrills and even more spectacle ) at a time when such films were all the rage , the saga was actually a pretty modest undertaking by eclectic ( and prolific ) German producer Artur Brauner . Despite the two films ' exotic , handsome look ( not least in the provocative dances of Debra Paget ) , the budgetary constraints were painfully obvious in the special effects department , especially the hilarious appearance of a ' ropey ' cobra which is intended to ' test ' ( the scantily-clad ) Miss Paget's faithfulness to the Maharajah ! ! All in all , even if these films hardly constitute Lang's greatest work ( though he harbored an evident affection throughout his life for this particular tale , which was originally conceived by his former wife Thea von Harbou ) , they have great - and enduring - appeal for aficionados of old-fashioned , serial-like adventure stories tinged with romance and mysticism . Even so , while I don't subscribe to that school of thought myself , there are some film critics ( Tom Gunning , Jean Douchet and Pierre Rissient among them ) who think very highly of Lang's Indian diptych - the first considering it one of Lang's towering achievements and the last two numbering it among the ten greatest films of all time ! !
577323	1399158	71507	6.0	FLAVIA , THE HERETIC ( Gianfranco Mingozzi , 1974 )	I first read about this " Nunsploitation " effort ? considered among the most extreme of its type ( infamously featuring a scene in which a naked girl climbs inside the hanging carcass of a cow ! ) ? in the Leslie Halliwell Film Guide , but became even more interested in checking it out in the wake of online reviews for the R1 DVD from Synapse . However , I somehow never got around to acquiring it ? chiefly because the print included was English-dubbed ? though , in retrospect , that's what the actors are speaking ( with leading lady Florinda Bolkan providing her own voice ) . Then , just last week ? coincidentally , on the very same day I acquired an even more obscure entry within the same genre ( albeit of a much-filmed source i . e . THE NUN OF MONZA [ 1969 ] ) ? I stumbled upon a copy of FLAVIA itself and , at this stage , I simply could not let the opportunity pass me by . The film's reputation for gory depictions of carnage and torture was not exaggerated but , seeing how these scenes are part and parcel of its unflinching portrayal of the Middle Ages ( stunningly shot in earthen tones by Alfio Contini ) , they do not feel gratuitous or sensationalistic ; besides , the whole comes wrapped in an evocatively beautiful soundtrack courtesy of future Oscar-winner Nicola Piovani . Bolkan , able to convey much without the benefit of dialogue , is impressive as ever : she convinces in her character's every facet ( including donning a soldier's armor ) , and this is possibly her signature role . Maria Casares ( best-known for playing Death in Jean Cocteau's ORPHEUS [ 1950 ] ) is animated and uninhibited , despite her time-ravaged looks a ' la Alida Valli : for the record , I thought she would be playing the convent's obligatory stern Mother Superior but is actually the one to inspire Flavia towards rebellion . Claudio Cassinelli appears as a Jew befriended by the heroine , whereas Anthony Corlan ( later Higgins ) ? of Hammer's 1972 outing VAMPIRE CIRCUS ? is the young leader of the Muslim invaders ( none of whom look remotely Arabic ! ) aiding the heroine in accomplishing her male / Christian-hating campaign ? until she rejects marriage and conversion to his own religion . While having undeniably greater significance and scope than most films of its ilk ( though the expected hysterical writhing is still present in the form of a wandering sect afflicted by the bite of a tarantula ! ) , plot development is curiously lacking here ? which , coupled with the trademark deliberate pacing of the " Euro-Cult " style , makes for an altogether muddled ( if never less than interesting ) affair . An unexpected touch involves fantasy sequences showing various religious paintings come to life , often as a result of the nuns ' ( typical ) sexual repression . Naturally , we get plenty of nudity and , for violent highlights , anything from numerous beheadings , the castration of a horse ( ! ) , rape , sodomy , cannibalism , boiling oil being poured on a girl's naked body , nipple-slashing , impaling and skinning alive is the order of the day ! One final thing : viewers of the Synapse edition had regretted the lack of a trailer on that disc ; incidentally , a German one has been made available among the extras accompanying the X-Rated Kult R2 DVD of the afore-mentioned THE NUN OF MONZA ?
577635	1399158	74899	6.0	MIDWAY ( Jack Smight , 1976 )	In the vein of THE LONGEST DAY ( 1962 ) and BATTLE OF THE BULGE ( 1965 ) , this one’s basically the equivalent of BATTLE OF Britain ( 1969 ) – as well as a sort of companion piece to TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! ( 1970 ) . For this reason , it tries hard to be as authentic and detailed as possible ( with stock footage of the real WWII battle and constant captions indicating names of places , vehicles and personnel ) but then doesn’t allow much acting opportunity to its star-studded cast : with this in mind , the contribution of James Coburn ( as an officer who mistrusts the information denoting Midway as a probable enemy target ) , Robert Mitchum ( more on his character later ) , Cliff Robertson ( as Heston’s former buddy and superior to his pilot son ) and Robert Wagner ( as Commander Henry Fonda’s aide ) results in being especially negligible . Charlton Heston is the nominal lead : he’s seen having problems with son Edward Albert over the latter’s inopportune relationship with a Japanese girl ( when the latter continues to mope about his personal situation , Heston snaps in his inimitable fashion : " You better shape up , Tiger , or some hotshot Jap pilot's gonna flame your ass ! " ) . Henry Fonda is , as ever , the authoritative figure – playing the Admiral in charge of the defense operation at Midway ; Glenn Ford is Mitchum’s low-ranking replacement ( the latter appears as the well-known Admiral Halsey , who’s been confined to hospital due to a skin disease : apparently , the bulky and notoriously laid-back actor could have chosen to play any real-life character involved but deliberately opted for this thankless role – even so , he lends a welcome dose of humor to the proceedings , especially when he rebukes Ford , who wants to shake Mitchum’s hand for displaying the utmost confidence in him , with " You want us to lose the war ? ! " ) . Hal Holbrook is the enthusiastic old-timer who first detects , through a coded message , the Japs’ intention to attack Midway ; Robert Webber is the Commander of one of the three U . S . cruisers who see action during the famous and decisive battle . Monte Markham is the intelligence officer whom Heston approaches to intervene for the Japanese girl and her parents , who have been detained ; Christopher George is unrecognizable in the cock-pit as one of the leaders of the various flying squadrons involved in the dogfight sequences . Toshiro Mifune and James Shigeta are the most renowned actors on the Japanese side ( one can notice the effort they all did to speak their lines in English ! ) – the country’s defeat at Midway was clearly the result of over-confidence ( brought on by a previous victory , albeit a sneak attack , at Pearl Harbor ) and constant bad judgment on the part of the officers concerned . Incidentally , just for the record , the film features three actors from the cast of THE YAKUZA ( 1974 ) – which I’ve just watched – namely Mitchum , Shigeta and Christina Kokubo ( Albert’s girl ) . The various strategies by which the battle was fought maintain reasonable interest throughout , and the action sequences – which virtually take up the last third of the running-time – are certainly spectacular enough . Hell , even the domestic asides emerge to be less distracting than I had anticipated ( though the same can’t be said of the few scenes from the so-called " TV version " of the film included among the DVD supplements , which introduce the useless character of Heston’s much-younger girlfriend ! ) ; having said that , this added footage does dwell a little on Heston's inability to fly due to a hand injury ( which , of course , has a bearing on his eventual fate ) . In the long run , however , I feel that MIDWAY comes across a bit stiff as entertainment .
576840	1399158	833098	6.0	Masters Of Horror : The Screwfly Solution ( TV ) ( Joe Dante , 2006 )	THE SCREWFLY SOLUTION is my fourth venture into this promising TV series and what attracted me primarily to this particular episode was the involvement of Joe Dante ( whom I often saw – and even spoke to twice – during the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004 ) ; however , the fact that a hunk – BEVERLY HILLS 90210’s Jason Priestley – was going to be the lead didn’t seem too promising on paper and , in fact , the recurring steamy sex scenes ( while related to the theme of the episode ) almost made it seem like something out of the RED SHOE DIARIES series at times ! Still , Priestley’s bedfellow – Briton Kerry Norton – gives a good performance , is the real protagonist of the story and , ultimately , the best thing about it ; Elliott Gould is also on hand to offer fine support as Priestley’s scientific partner and , eventually , together with Norton , one of the last untainted earthly survivors . Unfortunately , the theme – the male population is infected by a virus which makes them viciously exterminate every female they come across indiscriminately – while interesting and engrossing in itself is just too similar to that of 28 DAYS LATER ( 2002 ) and its sequel , 28 WEEKS LATER ( 2007 ) ; besides , its resemblance to the screwfly’s predicament is tenuous at best ( though the revelation as to the source of the epidemic is interesting ) .
576295	1399158	60330	6.0	DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD ( Gerald Thomas , 1966 )	I've only watched 8 of the long-running and hugely popular " Carry On " films ; their overall quality is quite patchy , but the most consistently entertaining so far have been CARRY ON . . . UP THE KHYBER ( 1968 ) and CARRY ON HENRY ( 1971 ) . This one was actually in the same vein as the latter i . e . a period romp and , in fact , I find their brand of bawdy humor works best in this environment - not only because it allows for a contrast between modern times and the era being lampooned ( including , in this case , parlor entertainment that features a minstrel tune whose chorus is lifted from The Beatles ' " She Loves You " ! ) but also because it gives the low-budget films a semblance of grandeur not possible with their outings having contemporary settings . I decided to check this film before others in the series ( happily , my local DVD rental outlet carries a handful of them ) because I'm currently going through a bit of a swashbuckling phase as part of my Christmas marathon . Anyway , it's an extremely typical offering ( despite dropping the " Carry On " from the title , though it did get renamed CARRY ON PIMPERNEL for the U . S . ) that obviously deals with the French Revolution , which is being thwarted by a Scarlet Pimpernel-type figure who calls himself " The Black Fingernail " and leaves as his calling card a drawing with the " Up Yours ! " gesture : the overall effect is hit-or-miss and the pace rather sluggish for what should essentially be a zippy adventure - but the host of practiced regulars from the series are in good form , thus ensuring the occasional hilarious moment or quip ( usually for this gang , these would be double entendres and even include asides to the audience ! ) .
576252	1399158	67256	6.0	L'Istruttoria E ' Chiusa : Dimentichi ( Tante Sbarre ) ( Damiano Damiani , 1971 )	This poliziottesco of sorts isn't quite what I was expecting as lead Franco Nero's plight is only one of several events tackled in the film . The star is ideally cast as a wronged prisoner ; however , Riccardo Cucciolla's paranoid character grows in importance in the film's second half . The initial stages are actually akin to bizarre black comedy ( detailing all the various eccentric antics of the inmates ) , which doesn't quite jell with the more serious tone later on ; John Steiner ( as a despicable lifer ) and Georges Wilson ( as a dying old-timer ) make a particular impression during this first part . The film - whose translated title , " The Case Is Closed : Forget It " , is no better than that of the novel " Many Bars " on which it's based - depicts everybody as corrupt and reprehensible , with even Nero's everyman hero succumbing in the end ( indulging in clandestine sexual encounters with a female inmate and keeping silent over Cucciolla's harrowing murder ) ! Though the score is by Ennio Morricone , it's nothing like the iconic work by the maestro we all know and love - consisting solely of sound effects ( in fact , I had first heard of the film by way of a CD featuring some of his oddest soundtracks ) ! This was Nero's third of four films he made with director Damiani , all in the same vein ; two of them , which I hadn't watched before either , followed this viewing ( I had caught up with HOW TO KILL A JUDGE [ 1974 ] , recently released on R1 DVD by Blue Underground and perhaps the most satisfactory of them , a couple of years ago ) .
577638	1399158	71589	6.0	THE GUN AND THE PULPIT ( TV ) ( Daniel Petrie , 1974 )	Of the various Westerns included in the 2-Discer I rented in order to view THE JACKALS ( 1967 ) , this made-for-TV outing seemed to me to be the least promising or , if you will , the most disposable . However , it seemed silly to me to consciously pass on it as long as it was in my hands and , funnily enough , it turned out to be the most satisfactory of the lot ! The cast list was decent enough , actually – Slim Pickens , Geoffery Lewis , Jeff Corey and Estelle Parsons – so I had that to look forward to from the outset . However , it was the winsome performances of the youngsters – Marjoe Gortner and Pamela Sue Martin – which was the most pleasant surprise . The latter was familiar to me from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ( 1972 ) and her signature role of Fallon Carrington Colby in the TV-series DYNASTY ( 1981-84 ) but the former I only had vague knowledge of i . e . that he appeared in the disaster epic EARTHQUAKE ( 1974 ) and the notorious Euro-Cult item , STARCRASH ( 1979 ; which , incidentally , I recently acquired as a DivX ) . Gortner’s amiable personality – playing a hounded gunfighter opportunistically taking on the identity of a dead parson in a one-horse town – managed to carry the film throughout its brisk 74-minute running time . Frankly , the above-mentioned character actors don’t have all that much to do in the film – apart from Slim Pickens who appears as Gortner’s cynical observer of a sidekick – but Geoffrey Lewis scores as another famed gunfighter out to take Gortner in a face-to-face shootout which sees both duellists missing each other ( out of respect for one another ) !
578075	1399158	78975	6.0	THE SILENT FLUTE ( Richard Moore , 1978 )	I'd been intrigued by this one for some time due its being based on a story concocted by Bruce Lee and James Coburn ; when it emerged as a " Special Edition " via the Blue Underground label , I had considered purchasing the DVD but somehow never got around to it . Eventually , CIRCLE OF IRON ( as it's better-known ) was even expanded into a fully-loaded 2-Disc Set ? but , then , I happened upon the original disc at a local rental outlet and finally decided to check it out . As it happened , I was somewhat let down by the film : I'm all for exotic action / adventure stuff ? a genre which got something of a revival during this era ? but , despite the various trimmings ( martial arts , mystical overtones , plus a number of rather superfluous cameo appearances by the likes of Roddy MacDowall , Eli Wallach and Christopher Lee ) , THE SILENT FLUTE came across as invincibly low-brow ! Besides , while David Carradine is ostensibly the star ( and even gets to play four different parts for no discernible reason ! ) , the hero proper of the narrative was played a beefy protégé of his ? Jeff Cooper ? whose wooden performance here really drowned the film for me ! ! The plot ? the winner of a martial arts tournament is assigned the task of seeking the whereabouts of a famous wizard ( played by horror legend Lee ) who is in possession of an all-powerful book ? sounds intriguing on paper but , to be honest , the way this plays out on screen it's not terribly compelling ; worse still , the denouement is a real cop-out ! That said , the numerous action sequences and Carradine's characterization of a blind shepherd ( himself a martial arts champion ) who guides Cooper on his danger-fraught journey make the film palatable for the most part . Despite the obvious low-budget at his disposal , too , one-time-only director Moore ( his more typical credit is as a cinematographer ) lends the film reasonable visual style ? accentuated by the expansive Israeli locations ( which constitutes the film's main asset along with Australian composer Bruce Smeaton's beautiful score ) . As a matter of fact , Moore admits in the disc's Audio Commentary that the main reason that seemed to have gotten him the assignment in the first place was because his background as a cameraman assured ( in the eyes of the producers , at least ) outstanding visuals ! THE SILENT FLUTE is , ultimately , a hodgepodge of disparate ideas ( with its most bizarre element being Wallach's masochistic " Man In Oil " and his diatribe on the virtues of a life without one's own genitalia ! ) which don't really jell and , consequently , it works only in fits and starts . . .
578204	1399158	63606	6.0	SIMON BOLIVAR ( Alessandro Blasetti , 1969 )	To begin with , I had never heard of this one before its late-night screening on Italian TV not too long ago ; the sole appraisal I read about it back then gave the film ? revolving around the struggle under the titular general to unite the South American countries into repelling the Spanish oppressors ? the thumbs down but I have to say that I liked it well enough . Incidentally , it proved distinguished director Blasetti's swansong ? a return to the epic scale of his most famous productions i . e . THE IRON CROWN ( 1941 ) and FABIOLA ( 1948 ) , though certainly not up to them despite effort all round . Maximilian Schell makes a fine , thoughtful lead ; he is supported by the likes of Rosanna Schiaffino ( as the unfulfilled wife of an enemy officer who becomes romantically involved with Bolivar ) and Francisco Rabal ( as a peasant leader who , at first , is unwilling to serve under the Venezuelan general but subsequently emerges the most loyal among his allies ) . As a matter of fact , Schell brings together about 5 different factions ? all of whose individual endeavor had proved futile , while as one army they manage to make a considerable dent in the Spanish lines ; that said , Bolivar's zeal ( driving the exhausted soldiers on to further conquests ) is misconstrued even by his own followers and ends up accused of dictatorial presumptions ! Needless to say , the film's tone is heavily redolent of the revolutionary fervor which marked the latter half of the 1960s : in that respect , one can also detect links with the Spaghetti Western subgenre ? particularly in view of a jauntily rousing score by the reliable Carlo Savina . The emphasis here is on impassioned speeches and period detail ( the widescreen location photography is a big plus , too ) rather than sweeping battle scenes yet , when it has to rely upon them , they are still reasonably well-staged .
577756	1399158	413267	6.0	SHREK THE THIRD ( Chris Miller and Raman Hui , 2007 )	I had enjoyed the first Shrek film due to its novelty but was somewhat lukewarm towards the second ; I'm even more so , then , with respect to this new entry . It's still eminently watchable for the gags , the in-jokes and the apparently unlimited possibilities of the CGI technique . The best new character is surely Eric Idle's accident-prone Merlin , while the most amusing sequences are those involving the Frog King's death and Shrek's nightmare about his upcoming parenthood . However , its gang of gung-ho fairy-tale heroines and the generally modern attitudes on display – to say nothing of the typically refurbished pop / rock songs on the soundtrack ( including , of all things , Led Zeppelin's " Immigrant Song " ! ) – seem less intent on fulfilling the necessities of the plot than catering to potential box-office receipts !
576385	1399158	462499	7.0	RAMBO ( Sylvester Stallone , 2008 )	The fourth Rambo movie has been a long time coming ? 20 years ? and is the first one to be directed by Stallone himself ; like ROCKY BALBOA ( 2006 ) , this is a surprising return to form for Sly ? and , in this case , emerges as perhaps the best in the series . Even so , the storyline is pretty thin ? Rambo is hired to free a group of doctors taken prisoners in the war-torn jungles of Burma ? and the film atypically short for contemporary fare ( the end credits start rolling around the 80-minute mark ! ) . However , Stallone makes up for these with a thoroughly unflinching portrayal of the cruelty and gruesomeness of war ? which , instead of a modern Hollywood blockbuster , brings to mind those objectionable Italian-made jungle adventures or even the notorious " video nasties " of the 1980s ! As a result , it would be interesting to see how the previous entries in the series stack up against this no-holds-barred bloodthirsty update but , alas , presently I don't have enough time on my hands to find out ! What is certain , however , is that Stallone's " Planet Hollywood " pals ? Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis ? must be gnashing their teeth in envy ? as Rambo unequivocally proves here that he truly is " The Last Action Hero " . Incidentally , one is never really sure why the atrocities on the Burmese villagers are being perpetrated ( and on whose orders ) which , if one isn't bothered to come up with the expected metaphors , rather makes the relentless display of carnage throughout seem somewhat pointless and altogether less than entertaining ? despite the familiar strains of Jerry Goldsmith's stirring Rambo theme ! P . S . By the way , the print I watched sported the JOHN RAMBO title which , bafflingly , was shortened for the U . S . ? as it would have tied in well with ROCKY BALBOA itself .
576620	1399158	61204	7.0	THE WRONG BOX ( Bryan Forbes , 1966 )	A typical all-star extravaganza of the 1960s ( which I had also first caught on Italian TV ) based on a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson , this black comedy perhaps aspires to be a zany updating of KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ( 1949 ) as it revolves around the assorted mishaps of various people on the way to gaining the proceeds of a lottery . However , being patchy overall ? insufficiently witty and often resorting to heavy-handed comedy which outstays its welcome ? it fails to achieve that film's level of artistic merit ( culminating in a fracas at a graveyard , then , it also brings to mind the contemporaneous THE LOVED ONE [ 1965 ] ) ; however , we do begin promisingly enough with a number of nice skits wherein the long line of candidates to the fortune is severely diminished ( there's even a gag involving an accident-prone Queen Victoria ! ) . As for the remarkable cast , it's led by Ralph Richardson ( amusingly bugging everybody with his pomposity ? a coachman whispers to himself " God save us ! " at Richardson's hope that they meet again ) and John Mills ( atypically involved in pratfalls , especially when attempting to do in brother Richardson : the two live next door to each other and , yet , haven't spoken in 40 years ! ) as the last survivors of the deadly tontine . Also on hand are Michael Caine ( as Mills ' grandson ) who shares a rather boring , and unnecessarily flashily-presented , romance with Nanette Newman ( Richardson's ward and director Forbes ' real-life wife ) , Peter Cook and Dudley Moore ( making for a characteristically unscrupulous albeit bumbling duo ? incidentally , I should get to their maligned spoof rendition of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES [ 1978 ] presently ) , Wilfrid Lawson ( who's fun as Mills ' doddering butler ) and Thorley Walters ( the lawyer charged with handing over the money to the eventual winner ) . Besides , we also get guest spots by Peter Sellers and Tony Hancock in decidedly ill-advised character turns as eccentric doctor and befuddled Police Inspector respectively . The evocative period detail ( courtesy of cinematographer Gerry Turpin and production designer Ray Simm ) and John Barry's lovely score are flawless , however . For the record , the Spanish ( ! ) DVD edition I acquired is hardly optimal ? being not only regrettably panned-and-scanned but even going out-of-synch during the climax ? yet it will have to suffice for the moment .
577418	1399158	78111	7.0	PRETTY BABY ( Louis Malle , 1978 )	This was Louis Malle's first American movie and another one - like ZAZIE DANS LE METRO ( 1960 ) , MURMUR OF THE HEART ( 1972 ) , LACOMBE LUCIEN ( 1974 ) , BLACK MOON ( 1975 ) and AU REVOIR , LES ENFANTS ( 1987 ) - which dealt with the world of children . It was also a notoriously scandalous film because of child pornography issues ( the setting is a New Orleans brothel ) , which makes it a surprising choice for DVD release in this age of political correctness - although Paramount basically just slapped it onto disc , as it's a no-frills release ( with not even a trailer to go with it ) ! However , despite a notable cast ( Keith Carradine , Susan Sarandon , Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham ) , the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage . As a matter of fact , Shields became an international superstar with her role in PRETTY BABY - which is similar to the one played by Jodie Foster in TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) . Malle does not shrink from showing its protagonists ( especially 12 year-old Shields ) in the nude - but it's always tastefully presented , i . e . in a non-exploitative manner . Besides , the film's period reconstruction is impeccable . . .
577809	1399158	352248	7.0	Cinderella Man ( 2005 )	A pretty good and surprisingly compelling biopic which , apart from obviously emphasizing the traditional elements of a boxing drama for commercial purposes , tries to faithfully portray its background of 1930s Depression America ; this it does in meticulous detail but also excessive sentimentality , I think . Besides , the ' modern ' ( i . e . mannered ) performances of its stars and the occasionally over-emphatic direction rather serve to detach oneself from that particular environment ? which is not at all what the director intended ! Still , the film's trump card remains its technically proficient and tremendously exciting boxing sequences ( particularly the smooth transition from one fight to the next and the lengthy final bout between Braddock and Max Baer , though the latter is rather lazily presented as a one-dimensional villain in order to put the audience , no pun intended , firmly in Braddock's corner ) .
576870	1399158	1010048	7.0	SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE ( Danny Boyle , 2008 )	A curious mix of CITY OF GOD ( 2002 ) and QUIZ SHOW ( 1994 ) , this surprising multi-Oscar winner is a good film to be sure but also somewhat overrated ( as was director Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING [ 1996 ] after all ) . The editing is deftly intricate ( spanning several years , the story continually jumps back and forth in time ) and the exotic score certainly effective ; however , Boyle's flashy technique rings false within the context of its underprivileged setting ! SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have alerted the rest of the world to the dire conditions of life in ( the so-called ) modern India but , at the same time , it cannot have benefited the country's tourist industry any ! The film's trump card is actually the ' impossible romance ' at its core : the two young leads are believable and undeniably appealing . The whole " Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ? " angle , then , has a decidedly contrived feel to it : though apparently based on fact , the film was clearly intended as a fable . That said , some of the flashbacks do not really illuminate us as to how the hero knew the respective answer : for instance , does someone need to know who invented the revolver just because he owns one ( much less an uneducated person ) and would the final all-important question of such a show be one to which the answer could have easily been arrived at by common sense ( had it not been a recurring motif ) ?
576688	1399158	56912	7.0	CARRY ON CABBY ( Gerald Thomas , 1963 )	This is another solid entry in the popular series which , again , recalls earlier classics of British comedy – such as the Ealing and Boulting Brothers films . Kenneth Williams’ presence is missed here : apparently , he turned down the role of the shop steward ( probably influenced by Peter Sellers’ similar , award-winning characterization in I’M ALL RIGHT , JACK [ 1959 ] and eventually played by Norman Chappell ) because he felt the script was substandard – I disagree and , in fact , Talbot Rothwell became the series’ official writer from this point on ! Joan Sims is also conspicuous by her absence ( the " Carry On " stalwart’s typical role is played here by the slimmer Liz Fraser – incidentally , also a cast member of JACK ) . Sid James , however , is clearly in control – with Hattie Jacques as his female counterpart ; even Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey’s characters feel subsidiary here , the film being heavier on plot than the previous series outings I’ve just watched , though both get their big scene ( more on this later ) . The narrative concerns Jacques’ elaborate way of dealing with husband James’ slacking attentions : he’s a cab-service owner and totally absorbed in his work so , unbeknownst to him , she contrives to open a rival business – but with the advantage of young and attractive women drivers ! Connor is James’ sidekick ( involved with Fraser , tending bar at the cab-driver’s café ) who , at one point , appears in drag when he’s made to infiltrate the ‘enemy camp’ ( as part of a plan by James to get at the competition ) ; Hawtrey is an accident-prone novice driver ( his ‘baptism of fire’ is unsurprisingly fraught with disaster ) ; Jim Dale appears in his first " Carry On " as well , in a bit as an expectant father who takes cabbies James and Connor ‘on a ride’ and causes the former to miss his anniversary celebration ! While there’s some tit-for-tat routines between them ( the women – knowledgeable of the fact that the men have intercepted their radio signals – deliberately give out fake addresses , while James & Co . show their force by tampering with the vehicles driven by the ladies . . . except that the latter still get the upper hand , because their passengers are all-too-willing to lend a helping hand ! ) , the companies finally get together when one of Jacques’ cabs – with her , Fraser and the girls’ payroll inside – is abducted by a gang of crooks . All the various vehicles set out in co-ordinated pursuit and manage to corner the ‘stray’ cab in open-country ; the final gag , then , sees Hawtrey driving James’ car into a tree – so that the boss has no alternative but to hail a cab for himself !
577026	1399158	109550	7.0	DARK WATERS { Director's Cut } ( Mariano Baino , 1994 )	I first heard about this film relatively recently through the Internet and , then , became even more interested in it when the now sadly defunct No Shame label announced two separate DVD releases ? a 1-Disc " Special Edition " and a Limited 2-Disc Set , with added supplements and even a replica of the powerful amulet depicted in the film ! While a friend of mine who had watched DARK WATERS in the past told me he had been underwhelmed by it , I knew it'd be hard for me to resist blind-buying the not inexpensive set ? especially after reading the generally positive reviews which began cropping up ( often accompanied by awesome-looking stills from the main feature ) . Even so , it took me a long time to finally sit down and ? as it eventually transpired ? dedicate a whole evening to the work of Mariano Baino ! Anyway , I was glad to see for myself ( please bear in mind that I'm not usually a fan of the modern style in horror ) that the hype surrounding this particular flick was indeed justified ? for this is surely one of the most audacious and impressive genre outings to emerge in the last two decades , even if the plot itself is derivative of several older ' classics ' . In fact , the cut-off and openly hostile community smacks of THE WICKER MAN ( 1973 ) ; the inquisitive female lead ( often dressed in red ) and the generally weird goings-on brought SUSPIRIA ( 1977 ) to mind ; the creepy girl featured in the flashbacks could well have strayed in from KILL , BABY ? KILL ! ( 1966 ) ; and the members of a religious order with their blind leader ( sinister-looking but eventually revealed to have benign intentions ) stems from THE SENTINEL ( 1977 ) . Besides , the film's overall look ? with full-size crosses fitted in candle-lit caverns , to where self-flagellating nuns habitually convene ? clearly owes a strong debt to ALUCARDA ( 1975 ) . Still , it all makes for a highly intriguing mélange of visceral thrills ( Lovecraftian monster , some instances of gore ? including depictions of cannibalism ) and mysticism ( the afore-mentioned amulet , a mystery from the heroine's past residing within a series of riddles ) ; dialogue is minimal as well ( which is just as well ? in view of the fact that the film was shot in English in the Ukraine with a multi-national cast and crew ) , and there are definite moments of lyricism throughout ( given its elemental and spiritual overtones ) . While rather drab-looking ? as opposed to the traditionally garish " Euro-Cult " style ( DARK WATERS came at the extreme tail-end of the trend ) ? and featuring a largely unobtrusive score , this austerity actually helps the essentially oppressive mood which permeates the film . The result , then , contains more than its share of haunting images : the line-up of nuns along the horizon carrying burning crosses , the grotesque figure of the crucified ' monster nun ' ( ! ) , Sister Sarah's revolting ' unclothed ' appearance as a half-human / half-beast at the climax , and the closing reveal of the heroine as the convent's new blind sentinel . With an elliptical narrative ( typified by the scene where the lead suddenly finds herself on the shore eating raw fish ) infused with symbolism and the deft juxtaposition throughout of image and sound ( a death in a blazing cabin intercut with a murderous attempt on Sister Sarah , or the association between children crying and the growling creature ) this is the kind of film which needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate ! At the end of the day , however , the evident low-budget of the production couldn't effectively cater to all the various themes conveyed in its over-ambitious script ? so that some plot points remain obscure ( such as where the mural painter apparently dwelling within the depths of the convent fits in the whole scheme of things ) , whereas the fact that the appearance of the creature is downplayed during the climax was probably forced on the film-makers rather than a deliberate decision on their part ? but these don't effect one's evaluation of the finished product in any significant way . Incidentally , the No Shame edition presents the film in a new director's cut ( running 92 minutes though , not 89 as listed ) which removes 7 minutes from the theatrical release version ; this footage is still included as deleted scenes ( even if it's perhaps the weirdest collection of outtakes that I've come across since , on several occasions , a mere number of frames were taken out of specific scenes ! ) . As I said at the start , I followed this viewing with three short subjects by Baino , which proved equally stylized ( and unpleasant ) ? making for a decidedly grim night ! I wish I had the time to delve into the other extras as well ? the two documentaries and the various commentaries ? as Baino seems to be a talent to watch , and I'd certainly like to know more about the main feature ( whose making was reportedly fraught with problems ) .
576788	1399158	18119	7.0	THE LOVE OF ZERO ( Robert Florey and William Cameron Menzies , 1927 )	The experimental nature of this fairytale-style short ( by a couple of notable craftsmen ) means that the technique on display swamps what little plot there is ? in fact , it was part of a DVD collection of American avant-garde films . In any case , we get a dapper-looking artist in love with a girl : she returns his affections , but is promised to someone else ; undaunted , he tries to impress another woman but she just laughs in his face ? after which he breaks down and is haunted by demons ! The film is actually intrinsically bizarre : not just in its marvelous CALIGARI-inspired Expressionist look , but the appearance and mannerisms of the lead character ( which are no less stylized ? particularly the speeded-up dance routine he occasionally engages in ) . The rest is made up of clever camera tricks which , though having little point in themselves , still manage to delight .
577411	1399158	87428	7.0	THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE ( Tony Richardson , 1984 )	At first , writer-director Richardson seems an odd choice here ? until one sees the jokey approach in action , redolent of his much earlier TOM JONES ( 1963 ) ; incidentally , despite being an American film , he brought along top exponents of the " British New Wave " such as cinematographer David Watkin and production / costume designer Jocelyn Herbert . Based on a celebrated satirical novel by John Irving ( author of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP [ 1982 ] ? which I guess I should get to now ) , it garnered mixed reactions but I found it quite engaging apart from the occasional heavy-handedness ; that said , having read the source material for myself , I have to say that the film falls short of extracting its full potential . There is no real plot to speak of , but a plethora of oddball characters ? not just the central family ( among them Beau Bridges , Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe ? not to mention their compulsively farting dog [ ! ] ) but also Wallace Shawn as a cycle-riding Dr . Freud with a bear companion , Nastassja Kinski as the latter's ' replacement ' after it is killed ( ! ) and Amanda Plummer as a gawky teen dubbed " Miss Carriage " . The film touches on some potentially controversial subjects such as incest ( Lowe is obsessed with Foster ) , homosexuality ( of both sexes ) and rape ( Foster falls foul of Lowe's football buddies , led by a young Matthew Modine ? who actually plays two roles ! ) . The acting is uniformly good , with Foster and Kinski ( despite a limited role ) coming off best . Reportedly , the rock band Queen was supposed to contribute to the soundtrack - with the song ' Keep Passing The Open Windows ' ( a much-repeated phrase in the film ) eventually finding its way onto their album " The Works " from the same year .
578001	1399158	64754	7.0	OH ! WHAT A LOVELY WAR ( Richard Attenborough , 1969 )	Attenborough's directing debut is patchy but impressive ( even garnering a Directors Guild Award nod ) , immediately demonstrating his affinity for grandiose subjects ; however , it was brave of him to go against the typically romantic view of British Imperialism ( not that it was an isolated case during this time - witness the comparable military caricatures depicted in Tony Richardson's THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE [ 1968 ] or , for that matter , Lindsay Anderson's irreverent expose ' of the education system in IF . . . [ 1968 ] ) . The all-star cast assembled for the film looks extraordinary on paper but , actually , only a few of them are given substantial roles - Dirk Bogarde's contribution is especially insignificant if still amusing . I was under the impression that the musical numbers featured in the film were written for the stage show which inspired it : interestingly , they're really a collection of songs that were popular around the time of World War I - notably sarcastic ditties ' improvised ' by the soldiers to take their minds off the grueling experiences on the battlefields ; best of all , perhaps , is a sequence in which a popular hymn is sung simultaneously by a church gathering and an army troop ( with the latter replacing the verses altogether to give it their typically cynical and anarchic perspective ! ) . Production values are top-notch but the overall structure , though generally admirably transferred to the screen , remains somewhat disjointed - the film coming across too often as a series of revue sketches which alternate between the cheerfully jingoistic ( Maggie Smith's stirring recruiting song ) , the broadly comic ( as in the scenes involving John Mills ' fanatical yet foolhardy Commander ) and the immensely poignant ( the wonderful sequence in which hostilities mutually cease over Christmas and the soldiers of both sides decide to meet in No Man's Land in order to share drinks and each other's company , not to mention the famous closing tracking shot over the endless graveyard ) , or else serve merely as expository passages ( as in the recurring stylized pier scenes where the leaders of the various countries - among them Ralph Richardson , John Gielgud , Jack Hawkins and Ian Holm - are seen converging to examine the progress of the war ) .
577286	1399158	435625	7.0	The Descent ( 2005 )	Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS ( 2002 ) with this nail-biting sleeper . After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE ( 1972 ) mode , the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise . The all-female cast members are relative newcomers , a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements , the supernatural and , at times , themselves . It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the " Crawlers " ( with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up ) for as long as he does ; if I were to nitpick , I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different ' voice ' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC ( 1997 ) . The surprise , downbeat , open-ended ' twist ' ending , then , is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before .
576485	1399158	536830	7.0	Carry On Laughing : Short Knight , Long Daze ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	This one's a good entry in the alternate " Carry On " series , once again revolving around a medieval theme . Kenneth Connor is an unlikely , pint-sized King Arthur ( he's possibly my favorite actor from the gang and perhaps the most underrated ) , Peter Butterworth is a bumbling Merlin , Joan Sims a flirtatious Guinevere , Jack Douglas ( a late but welcome addition to the " Carry On " team ) is the effeminate Sir Gay ( ! ) , Bernard Bresslaw the imposing knight who's supposed to defend the King's valor but prefers to spend time with the Queen ! A jousting tournament intending to showcase the cowardly Bresslaw's prowess sees Connor and Butterworth ? with the dubious help of Douglas ? cheat by devising a concoction capable of rendering the latter invisible to slay the proposed challengers ; on the day of the event , however , the effect wears off and they have to resort to a different weapon ! Incidentally , that same year , the Monty Python gang ? who started out in TV and then went into features ? made a big-screen ( and obviously superior ) lampoon of Arthurian times with the classic MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL ( 1975 ) .
577675	1399158	65895	7.0	MACHINE GUN McCAIN ( Giuliano Montaldo , 1968 )	This is a stylish , complex and exciting gangster melodrama ( which Leonard Maltin in " Movies & Video Guide " calls " junk " and awards a mere ! ) bolstered by an infectious Ennio Morricone score ( especially the title ballad ) . Amazingly , it was shown on Italian TV at the time of the Cannes Film Festival as part of a series of past nominees ; unfortunately , however , the print was of the choppy 94-minute U . S . version ( bearing the Columbia logo upfront ) and panned-and-scanned to boot ( making the Techniscope compositions pretty claustrophobic ) ! ! I've been unable to determine the film's original length , but I've seen running-times as long as 119 minutes ! The film is well-served by a great cast : an intense and fearless John Cassavetes as the title character , a delectable Britt Ekland as a girl he meets and marries on being sprung from jail ( who becomes an accomplice in his criminal schemes without batting an eyelid , at least in this version ! ) , Peter Falk as a bad-tempered small-time hood whose ambitions see him clash with his ruthless superiors , Florinda Bolkan as his even more avaricious wife , Gabriele Ferzetti as the crossed Don who goes to teach Falk a lesson ( and who seems to be having an affair with Bolkan ! ) , Luigi Pistilli ( rather under-used as Falk's right-hand man ) , Salvo Randone ( as the No . 1 Mafia Boss who keeps track of the situation from his New York office ) , Tony Kendall ( as the hit-man dispatched to eliminate both Falk and Cassavetes ) and " Special Guest Star " Gena Rowlands ( as McCain's tough old flame - together they were a legendary criminal double-act , and the real-life couple demonstrate undeniable chemistry in their one scene together ! - who , still having feelings for him , aids in his escape from the Mob and suffers the consequences for her actions ) . It's an interesting mix of ' styles ' : the Italians give it authenticity , the women a touch of class and the two male stars ( who , regrettably , don't share any screen-time but were eventually re-teamed in a gangland milieu in MIKEY AND NICKY [ 1976 ] - which I recently watched - and where they were practically inseparable ! ) an aura of intelligence . Some sources credit The Doors ' frontman Jim Morrison in the role of a lackey , but it certainly didn't seem like him to me ! The best sequence is the ingenious heist from a Las Vegas casino ( indeed , the glitzy and often sleazy locations are a definite asset ) and , in the cynical fashion of cinema in the late 60s , the films ends - rather abruptly - with a downbeat ' curtain ' . Montaldo didn't make that many films but from the three I've watched - the others being the enjoyable light-hearted caper GRAND SLAM ( 1967 ) and the excellent IL GIOCATTOLO ( 1979 ) , a Death Wish-type drama with a remarkable leading performance from Nino Manfredi - he certainly knew his business .
577521	1399158	57295	7.0	MATANGO ( Inoshiro Honda , 1963 )	This is the seventh Honda film that I've watched but only the second that I found to be in any way satisfying ? the other being , of course , GOJIRA ( 1954 ) ; actually , I've got five more of his titles to go ( which I'll be checking out throughout the week ) ? though , in all honesty , I only expect the earlier effort RODAN ( 1956 ) to be any good ! The theme and setting of the film derives from a number of earlier horror / sci-fi classics : for instance , the flashback framework where the hero's tall tale is disbelieved by everyone ? not to mention the scene in which he's seduced to the ' other side ' by his transformed lover ? was certainly inspired by INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS ( 1956 ) . Conversely , it looks forward to another good Japanese genre outing i . e . GOKE ? BODY SNATCHER FROM HELL ( 1968 ) with its disparate group of stranded passengers and the influence on them of the unfamiliar ' contaminated ' environment ( which slowly but surely leads to the disruption of the unit ) . Incidentally , despite the distinction given to each of the characters ( psychologist , author , entrepreneur , skipper , etc . ) ? including two females ( one a sluttish chanteuse and the other a naïve student ) ? none are developed in enough detail to be allowed to take center-stage . Interestingly , too , the identity of the sole male survivor among them is not immediately disclosed ; the revelation at the end , then , takes proceedings into unexpected amour fou territory ! As for the mutant creatures ( the U . S . title of the film , in fact , was the catchpenny ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE ) , they're quite silly-looking in themselves ? but , sensibly , these are mainly depicted as menacing shadowy figures . Though not quite the sci-fi masterpiece that Enrico Ghezzi ( eccentric presenter of " After Hours " , the programme during which the Honda TV marathon was held ) proudly claimed in his introduction , it's quite an engaging and effective piece ? if somewhat lacking in pace . All in all , I wouldn't mind owning the SE DVD of MATANGO from Media Blasters eventually ( also given the fact that the Italian subtitles on the version I watched were too rapid to read through at times , while the image itself suffered from occasional momentary freezing ! ) . . .
575994	1399158	57323	7.0	I MOSTRI ( Dino Risi , 1963 )	This is considered a classic of Italian comedy – one of many anthologies satirizing their way of life while showcasing the versatile talents of particular stars ( in this case , Vittorio Gassman and Ugo Tognazzi ) ; director Risi would himself later make the similarly episodic I COMPLESSI ( 1965 ) , SESSOMATTO ( 1973 ) and this film’s own sequel , I NUOVI MOSTRI ( 1977 ) – which , quite surprisingly , was a Best Foreign Language Academy Award nominee the following year . As with most films of its type , quality varies throughout the 20 ( ! ) episodes – some of these are so short that they’re over before having even begun , while others work their way to a punchline which can be seen coming a mile off ; however , a fair number of them are genuinely inspired and side-splitting to boot ( the general tone throughout , as befits the title , is one of irreverence ) . A few episodes include other name performers – such as Michele Mercier and Lando Buzzanca – but it’s Gassman and Tognazzi’s show all the way ( the two appear either separately or as a team ) . Armando Trovajoli’s upbeat score ( which is mixed with a handful of current hit songs ) is the perfect accompaniment to this entertaining and well-made compilation . My favorite episodes are the following : the opening one – in which scoundrel Tognazzi’s schooling of his nerd-ish son ( real-life offspring Ricky , later an actor and director in his own right ) works all too well , to his own personal detriment ; another where a gang of ‘thugs’ including Gassman kidnap an old lady ( apparently for the nth time ) . . . as it transpires not for ransom purposes but , rather , so that she can perform a dangerous and humiliating stunt involving a wheelchair-bound woman being thrown into a pool in a film whose director is Gassman himself ( in another role ) ! ; also , a courtroom drama in which simple-minded Tognazzi’s voluntary testimony is turned against him by the underhanded tactics of the defense counsel ( a flamboyant Gassman ) ; the most famous episode , then , is the concluding one with the stars as a couple of boxers way past their prime who decide to try their luck at the game one last time ( with Gassman in the ring and Tognazzi as his manager ) – we last see them flying a kite on the beach , Gassman having taken such a severe beating that he is reduced to a vegetable ! Other notable skits include the titular episode where a murderer is captured by a couple of cops – except that these are so ugly that one wonders who The Monster actually is ! ; one involving a soldier ( Tognazzi ) who meekly presents his deceased sister’s diary to a newspaper , ostensibly the one she was most sympathetic to herself . . . except that it eventually transpires that he was merely interested in how much he could make out of the salacious memoirs and that he naturally would let them go only to the highest bidder ! ; yet another deals with Gassman , living in the slums with a plethora of kids and relatives , cursing his rotten luck – and , yet , has no qualms about spending his measly pay on soccer matches every Sunday ( where he contrives to forget all his misery and lets rip with enthusiasm for the game ) ! Two ( minor ) episodes , then , play with issues of gender and sexual orientation : in one Gassman even appears in drag as a female literary critic ( who awards the " Book Of The Month " prize to none other than her own protégé , a novice author ! ) , and in another Tognazzi and Gassman play beach studs who discover they have greater affection for each other than their possible ‘preys’ !
577761	1399158	64902	7.0	THE BLOOD ROSE ( Claude Mulot , 1969 )	I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it , so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare . Even more surprising is the fact that I found this to be so good and engaging , despite being the nth revamping of one of my all-time favorites - Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE ( 1959 ) . Also , I expected it to be much trashier ? considering the dubious epithet " the first sex-horror film " that's attached to it ; there is a reasonable amount of nudity here , but this is generally tastefully presented . Actually , it exudes a rather classy atmosphere ( with cinematography by the renowned Roger Fellous ) peculiar to French horror cinema ? similar , in fact , to other Mondo Macabro releases such as MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN ( 1960 ) , THE DIABOLICAL DR . Z ( 1965 ) , GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY ( 1971 ) and SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan ( 1974 ) . Lead Philippe Lemaire is appropriately debonair as the celebrated painter whose life and career take a nose-dive once his wife is no longer able to act as his muse ; the actor later worked for Jess Franco and Walerian Borowczyk but , sadly , ended his own life in 2004 . Anne Duperey is luscious and graceful during the early section of the film : the girl's loving relationship with her husband is presented in some detail , so as to render her subsequent bitterness ( which even drives her to commit cold-blooded murder ) both believable and poignant . The appearance of her scarred features , then , is subtly handled throughout ( presented mostly as blurry POV shots ) and the make-up itself quite well done . The actress eventually broke into the mainstream with PARDON MON AFFAIRE ( 1977 ) , a successful comedy later Americanized as THE WOMAN IN RED ( 1984 ) . Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype ? since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR . ORLOFF ( 1961 ) , a character to which actor and director would often return ( the last time in FACELESS [ 1988 ] , a viewing of which followed the next day ) . In THE BLOOD ROSE ( released as RAVAGED in the U . K . ) , he again plays the surgeon who aims to graft the face off a live victim : here , however , he's blackmailed into the task and actually doubts his own success ( his eventual fate , then , comes as a total shock ) . The dwarf manservants seen here may be something of a genre requisite , but they're actually well-integrated into the plot ? their rape / murder of a captive girl ( an intended , but obviously unwilling , face donor ) and subsequent beating by their disfigured mistress seemed a gratuitous digression at first , but it does help set up the film's wild and completely unexpected final act ! It's rather odd , however , that no revenge was visited upon the spited socialite who perpetrated Duperey's accident . The catacomb-like design of Lemaire's art gallery complements the Gothic atmosphere of his family château . As for the film's deliberate pace , this is characteristic of the " Euro-Cult " style ? typified by the scene in which an inquisitive girl is made to prowl the castle grounds for minutes on end . Unsurprisingly , Mulot ( who tragically drowned in 1986 ) later dabbled in porn cinema ? though the obscure crime film THE CONTRACT ( 1971 ) is considered as his best work . The DVD supplements include an interesting 23-minute interview with the film's assistant director ( and Mulot's brother-in-law ) , and a reasonably informative essay about the history of French horror cinema over the years ( going all the way up to the most recent examples ) .
577206	1399158	22074	7.0	THE SMILING LIEUTENANT ( Ernst Lubitsch , 1931 )	" The Lubitsch touch " was all the rage at the start of Hollywood's Talkie era , which is why musical trifles such as this one or the preceding THE LOVE PARADE ( 1929 ) ? skilfully made and pleasantly risqué though they might be ? ended up being major Academy Award contenders for a spell . In fact , the film under review got its sole Oscar nod for Best Picture ? an achievement which would become virtually impossible in a decade's time . Popular Continental crooner Maurice Chevalier plays his typical role of a Viennese roué who steals the girl ( an almost unrecognizably young Claudette Colbert appearing as a concert violinist ) of his comrade-in-arms ( Charles Ruggles , who unaccountably disappears from the film after the first few scenes ! ) ; standing guard at the ceremony of visiting royalty , he creates a diplomatic scandal for seemingly winking at the naïve princess ( Miriam Hopkins ) when in fact he had been making eyes at Colbert who was watching the parade from the sidelines ! To make amends , he is forced to marry Hopkins but he is not about to be tied down to a life of luxurious boredom and slips out in the commoner's uniform of straw hat and tuxedo for a night on the town every chance he gets ; in the meantime , the flustered King comforts his lonesome daughter by playing chess in her boudoir ! Colbert and her bandmates give a recital in Chevalier's kingdom and she finds herself invited to the Palace ? but it's Hopkins who summoned her ? to seek advice on how to ignite Chevalier's passion ! Curiously enough , Chevalier had been unusually loyal to Colbert instead of his usual roving self and it is only on the latter's advice ( and her involvement in Hopkins ' jazzy makeover ) that he finally abides willingly to his marital duties . As is customary for Lubitsch , what is left unsaid is about as important as what is spelled out and THE SMILING LIEUTENANT provides the director several instances wherein to indulge his subtle wit : the very opening sequence showing a tailor , who had called at Chevalier's to demand payment , leaving when the door is unanswered while a girl is ushered inside soon afterwards by the accomplice-butler ; the sequence showing Ruggles trailing behind Chevalier and Colbert and carrying her violin case ; Colbert's indoctrination of the stuffy Hopkins into what the modern woman wears and which music she plays , etc .
577034	1399158	950754	7.0	NEVER EVER AFTER ( Mariano Baino , 2004 )	This is a modern fairy-tale , not too far removed from the world of Tim Burton . While Baino's feature , DARK WATERS ( 1994 ) , had revealed an interest in esoteric subjects and medieval settings , the three accompanying shorts on its No Shame 2-Disc LE demonstrate an equal affinity for creating suburban nightmares with a definite satirical tone . Though more accomplished than his earlier cruder examples , it's also clearly a step-down from the narrative denseness of DARK WATERS ? since this is basically a one-joke film and , at 13 minutes , the shortest title in the set ! Being a cautionary tale about women's obsession with their physical appearance , resulting in a less than ideal fate for its likable leading lady , it's interesting that the two mad doctors here ? amusingly called Dr . Frank and Dr . Stein ( Baino must have watched Hammer's THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN [ 1958 ] at some point ) ? are also female ; both of them , then , sport an outrageous coiffure and ham it up incessantly throughout ! It's all very stylized , undeniably amusing , and even includes its own " Making Of " featurette on the disc ( which I did not have time to watch yet ) ; however , one hopes that Baino can come up with a subject for a feature-length film that would adequately follow up his striking first effort . . .
575952	1399158	51542	7.0	CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( Robert Day , 1958 )	Well , as it turned out , I needn't have worried that I would eventually regret my purchase of the Criterion set " Monsters And Madmen " - as this film proved superior to THE HAUNTED STRANGLER ( 1958 ) . Featuring literate dialogue and a more realistic story ( incidentally , inspired by the book " Triumph Over Pain " on which Preston Sturges also based his THE GREAT MOMENT [ 1944 ] ! ) , the film was made for something like twice the budget of THE HAUNTED STRANGLER and had the advantage of being shot on existing sets at the MGM-British studios . All of this allowed for an evocative and meticulous recreation of mid-19th century London , highlighting Geoffrey Faithful's cinematography and Anthony Masters ' production design . The film's opening sequence creates an admirable mood of mystery and dread , which is generally sustained throughout - propelled considerably by Buxton Orr's powerful score . Besides , here we have a truly remarkable cast - in my opinion , one of the best ever assembled for a horror film : Boris Karloff , Betta St . John , Francis Matthews , Christopher Lee ( impressive as the quietly-spoken black-clad resurrectionist ) , Francis de Wolff , Adrienne Corri , Yvonne Romain , Frank Pettingell , Finlay Currie , Basil Dignam and Nigel Green . While the film has some thematic points of reference with the Jekyll & Hyde story ( already dealt with in THE HAUNTED STRANGLER ! ) , Karloff's mad doctor cycle over at Columbia during the early 40s ( though all of these had contemporary settings ) , as well as THE BODY SNATCHER ( 1945 ) , it manages to hold its own perfectly well - and , as such , succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of cinematic convention into which THE HAUNTED STRANGLER falls ( rather than physically turn into a monster , here Karloff becomes addicted to chloroform ) . The film has been much criticized for its supposed gore , but it's really quite tame ( perhaps it's the intensity of the operation scenes that does the trick , suggesting a lot more than it actually shows ) ; I know the present version is slightly incomplete , but even the few seconds of deleted footage found among the supplements isn't all that graphic ! Even so , I really liked the way in which slow motion is utilized for the climax when acid is thrown into a character's face . The accompanying Audio Commentary is just as entertaining as all the Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon tracks I've heard : most fascinating here is the discussion centering around the film's chequered history - CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( by the way , though also known as DOCTOR FROM SEVEN DIALS , it was never shown under that title ) was released in the U . S . as part of a double-bill with the low-brow Italian horror WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS ' DORMITORY ( 1961 ) , which I watched a few months back ( on the other hand , THE HAUNTED STRANGLER was paired with another Gordon production , the maligned but quite effective sci-fi FIEND WITHOUT A FACE [ 1958 ] , also available as a " Special Edition " from Criterion ) . Just as informative are the separate interviews featuring director Day and co-star Francis Matthews ( he hates his performance and , amusingly , implores the audience not to watch the film merely for his sake ! ) and the audio-only career overview with starlet Yvonne Romain ( I was surprised to learn that she's half-Maltese and , apart from enjoying her recollections of the various distinguished leading men throughout her career , I was especially glad that she mentioned the ironic fact that Oliver Reed - with whom she appeared four times in film and TV - died in Malta ) . Finally , I didn't generally mind the fact that both this and THE HAUNTED STRANGLER were presented full-frame rather than being slightly matted so as to duplicate their theatrical exhibition - but there was quite a bit of overscan during the credit sequence of CORRIDORS OF BLOOD . . .
577000	1399158	48696	7.0	TARANTULA ( Jack Arnold , 1955 )	This is one of the most fondly remembered of the ' giant monster ' films popularized by THEM ! ( 1954 ) and , in hindsight , still ranks among the best of its type . I had first watched it on late-night Italian TV in my early teens and recall being somewhat let down ; I was more receptive towards the film on a secondary viewing ? since it's clearly a notch above the other titles in the " Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection " set ( save , obviously , for THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN [ 1957 ] ) . Anyway , the film echoes THEM ! ( which is the superior effort , by the way ) in several aspects , but is sufficiently different to stand on its own merits . Actually , it's a logical extension of the earlier film ? because even if we have only one mutant monster here ( not necessarily a budgetary imposition ) , it's an insect species that's far deadlier than the ants seen in THEM ! Besides , even if the resultant growth in size is man-made , it's the product of an experiment involving a genuine concern for mankind's future ( the creation of synthetic food , which would eliminate the problem of famine facing Earth's ever-growing population ) ; the fault , then , lies in man's own impatience at achieving his goal ! An original subtext to the central narrative ? and which , as Leslie Halliwell opined , is perhaps even scarier than the idea of an over-sized spider ? is the fact that the experiment is eventually conducted on human beings , causing acute acromegaly ( shown via amusingly exaggerated make-up ) ! The cast of TARANTULA may not be as prestigious as that of THEM ! , but it's certainly agreeable : regular Universal hero John Agar ( who's always a doctor of some kind in this type of flick ) and his sidekick Nestor Paiva ( here in a bigger part than usual as the sheriff ) ; we also get a sexy heroine in Mara Corday ( she later did similar duties in two other ' giant monster ' pictures , namely THE GIANT CLAW [ 1957 ] and THE BLACK SCORPION [ 1957 ] ) , and ever-reliable character actor Leo G . Carroll as the misguided ? and eventually deformed ? scientist . While the special effects of the rampaging spider seem variable at this juncture ( although rather better than I recalled them ) , they were probably considered state-of-the-art back then . Even so , perhaps the film's best sequence is the one where the monster attacks the doctor's house and lab , crushing them under its weight ; the image of the giant spider's eyes peering into Corday's window is still creepily effective ( and must have given 1955 audiences veritable nightmares ! ) . The satisfying climax ( featuring a bit by a very young pre-stardom Clint Eastwood ) first sees Agar , the authorities and the townsfolk unite in an attempt to deal with the arachnid their own way ? but , when this fails , they call a nearby military base for help ( whose speedy intervention , an obvious plug to the resourcefulness of the U . S . Air Force , proves infinitely more successful ) .
576294	1399158	36104	7.0	THE LEOPARD MAN ( Jacques Tourneur , 1943 )	Apart from its classic murder sequences ( particularly the first with its bloody pay-off ) , this one has an original , audacious structure ( criticized at the time because it was not understood ) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION ( 1994 ) , but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY ( 1974 ) ! ! Dennis O'Keefe is a wonderful lead as the sleuth figure ; in fact , the film is actually more of a thriller since the murders do not have a basis in the supernatural ( as was the case with the previous two Lewton / Tourneur collaborations ) . Though Jean Brooks is ostensibly the heroine , Margo is given more screen-time and her role is a lot more interesting : her performance as the doomed artiste - frequently resorting to her fortune-teller friend Isabel Jewell , who unfailing turns up the death card ! - is quite moving . James Bell underplays his pivotal role as the museum curator / animal expert ( which is similar to the brief doctor part he essayed in I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE [ 1943 ] ) ; also fine is Abner Biberman as the owner of the escaped leopard , who blacks out during his frequent drinking binges and thinks he may be the murderer . The small-town atmosphere is brilliantly captured on a studio set ( marred only by some corny elements in the script intended to accentuate the local color , such as the over-use of Margo's castanets - to the point where they even become a motif - or the birthday song delivered to the second victim of the titular creature . . . but , especially , the infuriatingly stupid mother of the little girl - who bullies her innocent and fearful daughter to an early grave ! ) ; the ' outdoor ' climax , then , is given an added touch of strangeness by taking place in the midst of a procession headed by a group of caped villagers ! Curiously , both the Leslie Halliwell and Leonard Maltin film guides give the running-time as a mere 59 minutes ; however , the two times I've watched the film , it's always been by way of the full-length 66-minute version ! William Friedkin's Audio Commentary is a good listen , despite his tendency to describe the on-screen action ( though almost always accentuated by his own interpretation of events ) ; this was his favorite among the Lewton horrors - and , in fact , it's very much underrated among fans but , personally , I loved it immediately !
576138	1399158	20668	7.0	The Bat Whispers ( 1930 )	The film does feel creaky , the humor is laid a little too thick for my tastes at times ( much like Paul Leni's THE CAT AND THE CANARY [ 1927 ] , in fact ) and Maude Eburne as the cowardly maid IS unbearable ? but this is more than made up for , in my opinion , by the film's dazzling cinematography , atmospheric sets and deliberate theatricality ( complete with asides to the audience in the finale ) . In any case , it's easily miles ahead of the inept and boring Vincent Price remake of 1959 ! You will have noticed that I have preceded ( as is my fashion ) the film's name with that of its director . I'll be the first to admit that nearly nobody today remembers Roland West , let alone be prepared to accord him " auteur " status , but you'll agree that the VERY distinctive visual style of the film indicates an assured guiding hand behind the whole project . Although hardly as well-known today or as easy to find , THE BAT WHISPERS is by no means West's only notable feature ; as a matter of fact , based on the minute information I've managed to find on them in my reference books , I'd be very interested in watching THE UNKNOWN PURPLE ( 1923 ; an intriguing-sounding precursor to James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN [ 1933 ] ) , THE BAT ( 1926 ; the original Silent-film version of THE BAT WHISPERS ) , the gangster drama ALIBI ( 1929 ; which even earned Chester Morris a Best Actor Academy Award nomination ) and CORSAIR ( 1931 ) , his last film . As for myself , the only other Roland West film I've seen is the atypical and rather unsatisfactory Lon Chaney vehicle THE MONSTER ( 1925 ) , which also happens to be a bizarre ' old dark house ' melodrama . Elliott Stein , in Richard Roud's indispensable tome , " Cinema : A Critical Dictionary ? The Major Film-Makers " described Roland West as " one of America's supremely original visual stylists , the director of a series of stunning thrillers . " He also names ALIBI " one of the most oppressive films ever made ? the distorted sets , odd angles and restless camera make it West's most Germanic work ? this claustrophobic little nightmare would be fully at home in a retrospective of the American avant-garde film . " Furthermore , he acclaims THE BAT WHISPERS as " a pictorial knock-out " and CORSAIR " a visual treat " ! Unfortunately , his promising career was suddenly curtailed by a real-life tragedy . West was involved and living with renowned comedienne Thelma Todd ( a frequent foil for Laurel & Hardy and The Marx Brothers ) in Malibu at the time of her mysterious death in 1935 . Neighbors heard them quarreling the night before the morning she was found in her garage overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning ; though a suspect , he was never arrested but , of course , he could never work in Hollywood ( or elsewhere ) again . I've only watched THE BAT WHISPERS ( twice ) , in Widescreen , on VHS and I've been meaning to pick up Image's DVD edition ( comprising also the ' alternate ' full-frame version , shot simultaneously by a different cameraman ! ) for the longest time . As it happens , from the online reviews I've read of the disc , the verdict as to which version is actually ' better ' seems to be pretty mixed .
577585	1399158	59924	7.0	YANKEE ( Tinto Brass , 1966 )	This was the notorious Brass’ sole legendary stint at a Spaghetti Western ( albeit one he subsequently disowned due to unwarranted interference from production executives ) : while perhaps not among the very best outings in the genre , it’s nonetheless individualistic enough ( featuring zooms , odd angles and flashy editing galore ) to intimate that the director should have allowed himself to be more versatile throughout his career ( rather than pooling his resources mostly on smutty erotica ) . I say this judging also by his following effort , the pop art semi-giallo DEADLY SWEET ( 1967 ) – which I had watched during the Italian B-movie retrospective at the 2004 Venice Film Festival ( with Brass himself in attendance ! ) . As can be deduced from the title , the leading character is an American – albeit played by a Frenchman , Philippe Leroy ( who proves a satisfactory figure under the circumstances , bringing out the lone gunman’s charisma , slyness and agility ) ; he’s identified simply by that epithet , which is a clear nod to Clint Eastwood’s iconic " Man With No Name " from Sergio Leone’s seminal " Dollars " trilogy . In fact , just as in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS ( 1964 ) , the Yankee here forms an uneasy partnership with the villainous boss ( flamboyantly played by an Adolfo Celi sporting a highly atypical dyed black hair-do ! ) and is eventually punished in memorable fashion – tied to a wheel and encircled by fire – when his ruse is discovered ; like Eastwood in the earlier film , too , Leroy finds an unlikely yet convenient ally in the meek local mortician ( who performs the duties of barber on the side ! ) . Incidentally , the chief baddie himself is flanked by a person who can best be described as his direct opposite – in this case , " philosopher " Jacques Herlin ; of course , there’s a woman involved as well – a shapely fortune-teller who’s subsequently abducted by Leroy and ends up killed by her own boss / lover when she tries to stand up for the American ! Though slightly marred by insufficient plotting ( the narrative essentially resolves itself into one long battle-of-wills ) and long drawn-out footage of horsemen on the move ( it seems that Brass found these outdoor transitions the perfect vessel for Nini Rosso’s wonderfully jaunty score ) , the film certainly delivers in the action stakes – with plenty of gunfights , brawling , a fiery reprisal on the innocent Mexican villagers , and an elaborate climax ( capped by the inevitable showdown between hero and villain ) involving an ambush by the bandits on a cache ' of gold being transported down river by the U . S . Cavalry .
577823	1399158	67350	7.0	LITTLE MURDERS ( Alan Arkin , 1971 )	High-pitched black comedy which descends into hysteria by the end and , being overlong for its purpose , becomes something of an exhausting experience . While the connotations to the urban / social malaises being satirized are decidedly disturbing , the film is nonetheless anchored by an excellent script ( Jules Feiffer adapted his own play for the screen – that same year , he would write CARNAL KNOWLEDGE which proved equally frank and perceptive of human relationships ) and performances . Elliott Gould – one of the most representative actors of American cinema in the 1970s – is in typical unconventional hero mode ( he had actually originated the role on the stage ) , while Marcia Rodd – who’s delightful – co-stars as his levelheaded girlfriend . Vincent Gardenia appears as Rodd’s human dynamo of a father , Lou Jacobi as a matrimonial Judge , Sutherland as a radical Minister and director Arkin himself as a seriously disturbed Detective . Given the latter’s acting background , it’s not surprising that he would choose to highlight just these aspects in his first feature-length stint behind the camera . The result , then , may be technically unfussy – though a happy exception is made with the inspired slow-motion depiction of Rodd’s shocking assassination . In view of the script’s prevalence for monologues , Arkin tends to favor long takes : especially effective are those delivered by Jacobi , Sutherland and Gould himself – when , immediately prior to the sniper incident , Rodd cajoles him into expressing why he " feels " the way he does i . e . apathetic ( by his own admission ) and which has reduced him to literally photograph excrement for a living ! The contributions of the flustered Gardenia ( the head of an eccentric family whose houselights are forever dimming ) , Sutherland ( in the first of two re-unions with Gould , his co-star from M . A . S . H . [ 1970 ] – the wackiness of his appearance here reminded me of the actor’s bit as Jesus Christ in the anti-war drama JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN from the same year ) , Arkin ( who , naturally , gives himself a brilliant paranoid speech – compounded by a stammer ) , Gould’s ultra-sophisticated parents ( including John Randolph ) , and even an inveterate obscene telephone caller nicknamed ‘The Breather’ ( with his sudden snapping to normality when informed of Rodd’s demise , thus giving himself away as a former beau of hers ! ) are extremely funny for those attuned to the film’s uniquely offbeat if melancholy mood . The surreal ending , then , sees Gould and Rodd’s family barricaded in their house and taking to indiscriminate sniping themselves ! Incidentally , Fox’s DVD edition of this includes an Audio Commentary featuring Feiffer and Gould – which must be pretty interesting ( for the record , I got hold of the film through ulterior sources ) .
577127	1399158	479143	7.0	ROCKY BALBOA ( Sylvester Stallone , 2006 )	The sixth ROCKY entry comes tiptoeing out of retirement after a 16-year hiatus and , against all expectations , practically revitalizes the initially highly-successful but subsequently maligned franchise . Sylvester Stallone takes complete control once again by starring in , writing , directing and serving as executive producer of this flawed but well-crafted and solidly entertaining audience-pleaser . I say flawed because of several ( mostly plot-related ) factors : firstly , Stallone is 60 years old and while not especially looking it , his physique has taken an undeniably flabby appearance ( particularly the face ) which does not exactly lend credence to the fact that the Boxing Commission eventually permits him to ply his past trade once more ; the brain damage implications which arose in ROCKY V ( 1990 ) are completely omitted here ; Rocky is now a widower and , although we see him sitting by his wife's grave several times throughout the film , Stallone could not resist giving in to convention and minority groups by introducing an unlikely - and saccharine - love interest in the figure of an old acquaintance ( Geraldine Hughes ) and her half-Jamaican son ; his ringside opponent here ( Antonio Tarver ) , while still colored as had been Rocky's most formidable nemesis Apollo Creed , sports none of Carl Weathers ' charisma or panache ( which made one care for the character if not exactly cheer for him ) , even if this could constitute a sarcastic jab by Stallone at today's utterly colorless { sic } celebrities in most entertainment spectrums . Even so , the film has other assets in Stallone's own determined , even moving performance , the presence of the grouchy ( but always welcome ) Burt Young and , most surprisingly , a well-written , perceptive script which highlights not only the plight of an ex-World Champion prize-fighter in today's disrespectful age dominated by computers and the search for increase of wealth over the old-fashioned values of dignity and pride but also , in the film's emotional highlight , the strained father-son relationship which arises when the younger generation has to regretfully live under the old one's ( however pale ) shadow . One cannot review a ROCKY film without mentioning the climactic boxing match and the one we have here , while understandably ( and judiciously ) more muted than the ones we had in the first four entries in the series , is still quite satisfying and invigorating . All in all , while I can't really join in the " Oscar buzz " chorus which was bandied about by a few here , Stallone would surely be in the running had there been an Academy Award for Best Comeback of the Year .
576125	1399158	60095	7.0	ALVAREZ KELLY ( Edward Dmytryk , 1966 )	This is another film I decided to re-acquaint myself with in order to pay a well-deserved tribute to the late , great Richard Widmark . It’s one of the last Westerns he did and , in fact , it came at a time when the old-style Hollywood approach to the genre was coming to an end ; actually , Widmark’s co-star from ALVAREZ KELLY – William Holden ( here playing the title character ) – would only a few years later feature in the film that gave the Western new-fangled maturity and an equally potent elegiac tone i . e . Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH ( 1969 ) ! Anyway , to get back to the matter at hand , ALVAREZ KELLY seems to me to be unjustly neglected when it comes to discussing large-scale Westerns of the era . It may be because there is little action per se – though the climactic skirmish / chase ( culminating in the blowing-up of a bridge : let’s not forget that Holden was one of the leads in two big-budget , star-studded war adventures , namely THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI [ 1954 ] and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI [ 1957 ] ) is exciting enough – or the fact that the plot is atypical ( inspired by a true incident in which a herd of cattle , sold to the Yanks by neutral Holden during the American Civil War , is stolen en masse from under their very noses by the opposing Confederate side , led by Widmark and who has abducted Holden to this end ! ) . With respect to this curious narrative , the film opens with a nice animated sequence depicting the importance of securing food at a time of war throughout the ages . The two stars’ respective parts have been tailor-made for their established screen personas . Holden is cynical , opportunistic and charming ( ironically , I’ve just recalled that I used these exact same words to describe Widmark’s younger character in GARDEN OF EVIL [ 1954 ] ! ) . Widmark , on the other hand , is here a tough army man whose commitment to the Southern cause makes him ruthless above all else – alienating him from fiancée Janice Rule , and even considering drowning the entire herd in a swamp if it’s to fall back into the hands of the Yanks ; sensing his unreasonable outlook early on , Holden quips : " God save me from dedicated men " ! They’re at their best in a couple of major confrontation scenes : the first in which a one-eyed Widmark shoots off one of Holden’s fingers ( while the latter is in prison ) because of his lack of co-operation , and when Holden coolly explains to an aghast – and subsequently furious – Widmark that the clandestine passage he arranged for ( on a steamboat which has just sailed ) was not for himself but rather the disenchanted Rule ! Predictably , but believably , the two men’s relationship ends in mutual respect – with Widmark even saving Holden’s life towards the end . The supporting cast is led by the afore-mentioned Rule , who does quite well by her Southern belle role ( another lady – played by Victoria Shaw – proves more responsive and loyal to Widmark’s exploits ) , and Patrick O’Neal in the part of the Unionist Major who negotiated the initial deal with Holden , is having a hard time convincing his superiors of the enemy’s incredible plan , and who can’t fathom how the black slaves are unwilling to emancipate themselves ( but rather shield those who want to keep them under their thumb ! ) . By the way , surely one of the film’s main assets is John Green’s cheerful and memorable score ( complete with a hackneyed yet agreeable title tune sung by The Brothers Four , an obscure folk group which seems to have remained active to this day ) . This unusual Western , then , is more than just a pleasant diversion ( an epithet by which it’s often dismissed ) : good-looking , engaging , and certainly never boring – despite a not inconsiderable length of 110 minutes ( though it’s listed officially on most sources at my disposal as being 116 ! ) .
576692	1399158	51452	7.0	CARRY ON NURSE ( Gerald Thomas , 1959 )	The second in the popular series is one of the best , but also the first in a quartet of medical lampoons from this stable – the others being CARRY ON DOCTOR ( 1968 ) , CARRY ON AGAIN , DOCTOR ( 1969 ) and CARRY ON MATRON ( 1972 ) ; I’ve watched the latter but not the other two , though I should be able to get to them fairly soon . . . Anyway , coming very early in the series , CARRY ON NURSE – which manages to make the most of its single setting – isn’t as crude or as slapdash as a good many of the later entries regrettably proved to be : in fact , it’s pretty much in the vein of classic British comedy of the time ( such as the satirical films by the Boultings ) . The cast brings together several practiced performers in the field : Kenneth Connor ( his " Cor , Blimey " attitude as a boxer with a broken hand is somewhat reminiscent of Norman Wisdom ) , Kenneth Williams ( having a less central role than would be the case later but in quite good form as a bookworm nuclear scientist who’s also something of a misanthrope ) , Charles Hawtrey ( playing a radio fanatic , where his prissy antics are already a bit over-the-top ) , Joan Sims ( as an accident-prone nurse ) , Hattie Jacques ( as the fearsome Matron – which became her trademark role ) , Wilfrid Hyde-White ( as an old man whose military record allows him privileged service at the hospital but hasn’t rescinded his gambling mania ! ) , Leslie Philips ( as a fun-loving sort who in a drunken binge with his fellow patients decides to have them perform his delayed operation themselves – the latter scene is the film’s hilarious highlight where , predictably , laughing gas is let loose at the most inopportune moment ) . The nominal leads here are actually Terence Longdon as a recovering reporter and gorgeous Shirley Eaton as the idealized nurse , who provide the obligatory romantic interest ; Jill Ireland ( the future Mrs . Charles Bronson ) has one of her earliest roles as the girl who finally ensnares Williams , while both Michael Medwin and Norman Rossington appear briefly – as , respectively , Connor’s manager ( a self-proclaimed showman ) and a punch-drunk remnant of the boxing profession . Other gags revolve around a snob patient who’s continually embarrassed by his commoner wife , another who’s occasionally compelled to run riot in the corridors , and an impossibly solemn-looking student nurse . Apart from throwing Longdon and Eaton in each other’s arms , the denouement sees the release of several of the ‘star’ patients from the hospital – and culminates with the long-suffering nurses’ revenge on the fastidious Hyde-White , by fitting a daffodil in his rectum instead of a thermometer just as the Matron is making her rounds !
576259	1399158	105636	7.0	TRESPASS ( Walter Hill , 1992 )	Enjoyable , fast-moving action flick which manages to make the most of its single situation – two white men in search of gold hidden years before are besieged inside a dilapidated building in a black neighborhood by a local street gang . Despite the modern trappings ( street-smart attitude , rap music , excessive foul language ) , the film is distinctly old-fashioned – in a good way – in its characters’ moral codes and plot development . One can see affiliations with John Huston’s THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ( 1948 ) with the squabbling white men in the Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt roles , and the wily old black tramp who inhabits the apartment where the loot is stashed filling in the old Walter Huston part ( the black gang , then , would be the Mexican bandits led by the scheming Alfonso Bedoya ) . Of course , this connection is tenuous at best ( since the Huston film has much more scope , whereas this is mostly confined to its apartment-building setting ) – but director Hill , or the surprising writer / producer team of Robert Zemeckis ( ! ) and Bob Gale , may well have looked at the earlier classic for inspiration . Needless to say , the cast of this one ( led by Bill Paxton ) is no comparison to Bogart et al but the rude and suspicious tramp character is fun – and , unsurprisingly , is the one to come out on top at the end . Thankfully , too , Hill has lost none of his flair in the handling of action sequences . . . even if , in the long run , the film doesn’t have the lasting power of his best work , namely THE DRIVER ( 1978 ) , THE WARRIORS ( 1979 ) and SOUTHERN COMFORT ( 1981 ) .
577503	1399158	44502	7.0	Clash By Night	Despite several of the genre's quintessential elements ( director Fritz Lang , director of photography Nicholas Musuraca , Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan ) , this is not a film noir in the strict sense of the word and , in fact , as was the case with DILLINGER ( 1945 ) , it made for a rather baffling choice to be included in Warners ' " Film Noir Collection Vol . 2 " ! Actually , it's one of Lang's least typical films , though his beloved theme of Man being unable to escape his Fate does in fact play a major part in the proceedings . In any case , CLASH BY NIGHT remains full of interest throughout and the melodramatic flourishes of the ( familiar ) ' love triangle ' plot - adapted from a stage play by Clifford Odets ( hence the tendency to overstate its points from time to time ) - seem to have inspired the cast and crew to give it their all : one simply can't ignore the excellent performances ( including a wonderfully disarming turn from Marilyn Monroe , not yet a star ) and the typically great , hard-boiled ( if often , necessarily , theatrical ) dialogue ( my favorites are two lines delivered , in his uniquely contemptible fashion , by Ryan - having had enough of a tediously uneventful night-out at the local tavern , he exclaims : " Excuse me while I shake this dump upside down ! " ; and describing the failed relationship with his estranged wife with the delicious " Sometimes I'd like to stick her full of pins . . . just to see if blood runs out ! " ) . Still , when all is said and done , perhaps the film's mostly notable for its remarkable documentary-style depiction of the fishing community ( Monterey , California ) in which it is set .
576771	1399158	55952	7.0	Monitor : Elgar ? Portrait Of A Composer ( TV ) ( Ken Russell , 1962 )	While considered something of a breakthrough in British TV , coming early in the director's career , he wasn't allowed to use actors in his film on composer Sir Edward Elgar other than in long shot or have them speak ! Despite this fact ( and noting also that none of Russell's subsequent trademark excesses are to be found here ) , I was surprisingly engrossed in it regardless . Incidentally , in the accompanying audio commentary , it's revealed that some of the episodes depicted ( or mentioned in the almost-constant narration ) had no real basis in fact ? with the director readily admitting that he had to fabricate much of it simply because there just wasn't that much known about Elgar at the time to begin with ! Russell makes good use of stock footage , ably juxtaposing military / royal parade with the horrors of war ( Elgar lived through both the Boer conflict and the First World War ) . Besides , he doesn't beat around the bush and repeatedly states that Elgar's talent was all but appreciated in his homeland and that the composer himself would eventually come to somewhat begrudge the fact that his best-known piece was the stirring yet ultra-jingoistic " Land Of Hope And Glory " ( so popular that it was virtually held as a second national anthem for Great Britain while , as Russell explains in the commentary , this music is played at the graduation ceremony of every school in America ) ! When all is said and done , however , the film is at its most effective during the lyrical passages in the countryside .
577542	1399158	44333	7.0	AGAINST ALL FLAGS ( George Sherman , 1952 )	By 1945 , and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces , Errol Flynn’s hold over U . S . box office had started to decline so , in spite of the increased burden of waning looks , he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name : the swashbuckler . The first of these was a good one actually – ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN ( 1948 ) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget Hollywood starring vehicle . The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe : in England for KIM ( 1950 ) , THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE ( 1953 ) and THE DARK AVENGER ( 1955 ) , in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN ( 1951 ) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL ( 1953 ) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS ( 1954 ) . However , Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers ‘A’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak . . . Still , the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and , while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self , his red-headed leading lady Maureen O’Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady . Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles , so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano , a role he attacks with gusto . Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH ( 1954 ) – a viewing of which preceded this one – AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant TV viewing when vintage Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels . For all I know , this might well have been the very first pirate movie I’ve ever seen and I cringe at the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about ! As I said earlier , AGAINST ALL FLAGS might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same . Nowadays , the amorous persistence of the child-like Indian princess ( Alice Kelley ) towards her pirate captor Flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of THE SEA HAWK ( 1940 ) and THE BLACK SWAN ( 1942 ) , to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging . Incidentally , the film would later go on to be remade as THE KING’S PIRATE ( 1967 ) with Doug McClure ! For what it’s worth , the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and , as a matter of fact , AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out " Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection " set from Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER’S GIRL ( 1950 ; with Yvonne De Carlo ) , DOULE CROSSBONES ( 1951 ; with Donald O’Connor ) and YANKEE BUCCANEER ( 1952 ; with Jeff Chandler ) ! Value for money , perhaps but , so far , I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources ; even so , if the mood strikes me in future , I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk’s MUTINY ( 1952 ) , the afore-mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA ( 1961 ) .
577619	1399158	139414	7.0	LAKE PLACID ( Steve Miner , 1999 )	Despite being aware of the good reviews it garnered on its release , I never got to watch until now : a ' B ' horror movie at heart , this is good old-fashioned entertainment ( despite the new-fangled CGI effects ) . Considering Miner had helmed a couple of lame Friday THE 13TH films ( which I've just watched , incidentally ) , this is a far more satisfying genre effort from him : engaging protagonists ( best of all is flustered sheriff Brendan Gleeson , but Betty White's eccentric character is also memorable - with the scene where she feeds a cow to ' her ' crocodile verging on the surreal ) , good level of suspense , thrilling action , some gore , and there's also a healthy dose of humor . . . though its attempt to lend gravitas to the main theme ( with the crocodile considered a form of deity ) doesn't work . There have been few croc films , with the most notable examples being THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE ( 1959 ) - which I'd love to rewatch , though I guess not enough to purchase Fox's bare-bones DVD - and ALLIGATOR ( 1980 ; to which this compares quite favorably ) - released as a SE by Anchor Bay UK , along with its straight-to-video sequel . By the way , while watching this I was reminded of another acquatic monster picture of recent vintage which I also missed out on - DEEP BLUE SEA ( 1999 ) - and I guess now's as good a time as any to check it out . . .
576183	1399158	26249	8.0	THE CRUSADES ( Cecil B . De Mille , 1935 )	To begin with , being a fan of the epic genre , I had always wanted to check this one out and , in fact , was very pleased when Universal released it as part of their 5-Disc Cecil B . De Mille collection ; however , since I already owned both THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ( 1932 ) and CLEOPATRA ( 1934 ) via TCM showings , I kept postponing the purchase of this set ? until I acquired the lot through a friend of my father's ! Having been duly impressed with those two De Mille spectaculars , I had intended to watch this immediately ( I got the film around the middle of last year ) but for various reasons ? I even had to exclude it from my Christmas viewing ? I could only get to it now that Easter is approaching ! Incidentally , the 5th of March happened to mark the centenary from the birth of actor Rex Harrison , who had starred as Saladin ( the villainous ' infidel ' of THE CRUSADES ) in KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS ( 1954 ) , which I recorded off Italian TV ( even if I had already watched it and in spite of its poor reputation ) expressly for the purpose of accompanying my viewing of De Mille's film ! Anyway , THE CRUSADES is another notable achievement ( from the days prior to the epic heyday of the 1950s and 1960s ) which goes to prove ? yet again ? that De Mille was perhaps cinema's greatest purveyor of hokum disguised as inspirational art for the masses ( even if this particular example , reportedly , flopped at the box-office ) . The central relationship between gorgeous Loretta Young ( such strong female presences abound in the director's work ) and De Mille regular Henry Wilcoxon ( an unusually handsome , and Godless , Richard the Lionheart ? amusingly referred to by Saladin as " The Lion King " ! ) goes through some interesting , yet oddly believable , tangents during the course of the film . Starting off in antagonistic vein more typical of then-current screwball comedies ( he even prefers carousing with his men to their wedding ceremony , where his place is eventually taken by the royal sword ! ) , it develops into one that borders on amour fou ? which could jeopardize the outcome of the whole crusade ( it's actually comparable to the bond-to-the-death between Roman centurion Fredric March and Christian slave Elissa Landi in the earlier THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ) ! The excellent supporting cast includes , among others , Ian Keith ( as Saladin ) , Joseph Schildkarut ( typically sneaky as one of the Christian rulers ) , C . Henry Gordon ( as the French King , whose sister Katharine De Mille ? the director's adopted daughter ? Richard has deliberately spurned ) , Alan Hale ( as Richard's minstrel / sidekick , a Little John type that would soon become his trademark ) , C . Aubrey Smith ( as the old hermit who is challenged by the overly confident Saladin at the beginning of the picture to rally the Christian countries in a crusade against his forces and , later , made hostage and chained to a cross to bar passage to the advancing army , he asks Richard to proceed with the attack regardless ! ) and Mischa Auer ( in an early role as a monk ) . While the script obviously eschews the Robin Hood legend that has become associated with Richard and the Crusades ( the Douglas Fairbanks version of 1922 about that popular outlaw figure , in fact , spends more time with him as a knight than the proverbial ' Merrie Man ' ! ) , subtlety is still the last thing one would hope to find in a De Mille pageant . In fact , Young's abduction by the Muslims ( with her dressed as a sentry in a suicidal bid to end the discord between the various royals ! ) is pretty contrived ; similarly , the fact that Young is contended in the terms laid down by Saladin for the truce with the Christian world is pure Hollywood . With this in mind , the dialogue ( co-written by Dudley Nichols ) is consciously stilted throughout ? albeit featuring such good lines as Saladin's defiant claim to the monarchs gathered in their tent , " There is room enough in Asia to bury all of you ! " Made after the dreaded ( and stifling ) Hays Code came into force , it's not as bloodthirsty as the afore-mentioned THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ? even so , the battle scenes are quite realistic ( with the clanging of heavy steel being heard as the opposing armies clash in a confusion of warriors and horses ) and may well have influenced Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander NEVSKY ( 1938 ) . There is one evident display of viciousness here on an isolated member of Schildkraut's treacherous army as a clutch of Muslim riders ( appearing on the scene to rescue the cornered Wilcoxon at the instigation of Saladin himself , in the hope of thus winning Young's love ) fall on him en masse with their spears . Boasting superlative photography ( Victor Milner's work in this capacity presented the film with its sole Oscar nomination ) and massive crowd scenes , the film survives as tremendous entertainment even after all these years . Incidentally , it seemed common practice in spectacles of the era to provide villains of the Muslim persuasion ? as can be gathered from the likes of ABDUL THE DAMNED ( 1935 ; a British production I first watched over Christmas ) , THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER ( 1935 ) , THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE ( 1936 ) and GUNGA DIN ( 1939 ) .
577464	1399158	47959	8.0	CRAZY MIXED UP PUP ( Tex Avery , 1954 )	From its title , I wasn't aware that I had watched this one before ? which , despite being a latter-day Avery effort , is every bit a classic cartoon . Again , the premise is simple yet totally insane : a man and his dog are trampled by a car while crossing the road ; a cross-eyed male nurse mistakenly applies the wrong kind of plasma to each , with the result that the man takes on the habits of the dog and vice versa . Of course , this sends the wife ( and the dog's own ' spouse ' ) up the wall ? even if both intermittently revert to their natural states and , obviously , think that it's their respective mates who are nuts ! Predictably , then , the ending sees the wife and her pet getting the exact same affliction after being run over themselves by a car ? and subsequently revived by the same eager but clueless medical attendant ! And they all lived happily ever after ?
576198	1399158	60862	8.0	The Professionals ( 1966 )	I've watched this terrific action-packed Western a couple of times in the past via my full-frame VHS and therefore I'll definitely upgrade now that this release is on its way . I'm certainly glad that Columbia has proved me wrong because I never thought they'd do it given that it's already available as a barebones disc . Anyway , the fact that THE PROFESSIONALS is indeed something special is borne out by all the major awards ( listed below ) it was nominated for at the time of its original release and which are not commonly bestowed on this type of genre picture : Best Direction ( Richard Brooks ) ? Academy Awards ; Best Adapted Screenplay ( Richard Brooks ) ? Academy Awards ; Best Motion Picture Drama ? Golden Globes ; Best Direction ( Richard Brooks ) ? Directors Guild Of America ; Best Written American Drama ( Richard Brooks ) ? Writers Guild Of AmericaFeaturing a great cast ( Burt Lancaster , Lee Marvin , Robert Ryan , Jack Palance , Woody Strode , Ralph Bellamy and Claudia Cardinale ) , beautiful camera-work and a typically fine Maurice Jarre score , the film is highlighted by Richard Brooks ' witty script and Lancaster's boisterous performance . It's worth noting here that Brooks had already directed Lancaster towards his only ever Academy Award in ELMER GANTRY ( 1960 ) and that the former made two other excellent Westerns in his career ? THE LAST HUNT ( 1956 ) and BITE THE BULLET ( 1975 ) . While THE PROFESSIONALS rarely crops up when classic Westerns are discussed , I'd say it lies somewhere between THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN ( 1960 ) ? where a bunch of " experts " on the fringes of the law are recruited for a seemingly impossible mission ? and THE WILD BUNCH ( 1969 ) ? where these same people realize they're getting on in their years and ultimately find themselves out of touch with the times they're living in .
577947	1399158	60544	8.0	INVASION ( Alan Bridges , 1965 )	This low-budget British sci-fi outing is so rare that I have had to make do with a copy sporting forced French subtitles for this first viewing ! I was glad to confirm that the film's solid reputation was well-deserved ; plot-wise , it is not dissimilar from two other notable genre entries from this country which I caught quite recently ? namely UNEARTHLY STRANGER ( 1963 ) and THE NIGHT CALLER ( 1965 ) . I recall being particularly impressed with the former and , actually , I feel that INVASION is very much on a par with it ; incidentally , the title is a misnomer since the aliens here are actually stranded on earth and their mission is to recapture an escaped prisoner they were escorting rather than occupation ! Even so , we do get a show of their ( typically advanced ) technology and , needless to say , there are human casualties involved ; to be fair , though , we never learn of their true intent until quite late into the game and , consequently , the carefully-built suspense and smart handling throughout ( this was director Bridges ' feature-film debut ) makes for consistently satisfying viewing . One rather clever notion has the aliens requiring to physically touch an Earthling before they can speak our language ? though , of course , no explanation is given as to why they happen to have an Oriental complexion ! In the long run , the modest scale of the production ( the setting is largely confined to a hospital and the woods nearby , with events unfolding over just one night ) works in its favor , making the central concept both gripping and persuasive . Hero Edward Judd was something of a fixture in British sci-fi around this time : his rugged good looks and evident intelligence were always good value for money in these fantastic surroundings ; leading lady Valerie Gearon does well by her role too , familiar character actor Anthony Sharp has a prominent ( if rather unlikely ) role early on in the proceedings and , obviously , the intervention by the military is a requisite in this type of film . Among the more visually striking moments are a shot where a door opening leads into a doll-house , with the camera then panning up to reveal the actual room , and a car very realistically crashing ( into the invisible barrier created by the aliens in order to isolate the area ) with its driver spurting out of the windscreen . As to flaws , these are indeed negligible ? but I suppose I should mention the fact that one of the alien women unaccountably disappears during the film's last third , while the climax is a bit rushed ( if still quite unique : the pursuing alien deliberately crashes her spaceship into a fleeing rocket bearing her quarry ! ) .
576553	1399158	86489	8.0	TWICE UPON A TIME ( John Korty and Charles Swenson , 1983 )	Despite the patronage of George Lucas , this captivating and totally original fantasy in " Lumage " ( a combination of animation through live action cut-outs ) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by Ralph Bakshi in his heyday . Brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog Ralph ( one of a duo of bumbling , rejected heroes ) , Synonamess Botch ( the hilariously foul-mouthed villain ) and Rod Rescueman ( the pompous novice superhero ) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept : Frivoli vs . Murkwood or , the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares . In this context , the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do . It's a real pity , therefore , that I have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot ( culled from a TV screening ) of the uncensored version ? there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its VHS release ? since the film is otherwise unavailable on DVD . Interestingly , both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities .
577703	1399158	29843	10.0	THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD ( Michael Curtiz and William Keighley , 1938 )	Possibly the greatest ( and most celebrated ) of swashbucklers , it's also the best Robin Hood film ( once again improving on Douglas Fairbanks ' already impressive Silent version ) and Errol Flynn's finest hour : delightful script ( not only providing several great lines for the actors to sink their teeth into - Claude Rains ' Prince John in particular - but it's put in the service of a plot which remains absorbing despite its over-familiarity ) , beautiful three-color cinematography ( by no less than three top-notch cameramen ! ) and costumes , an outstanding and Oscar-winning Erich Wolfgang Korngold score ( he virtually composed all of Flynn's swashbucklers and some of the best Warner Bros . films from this period ) , expansive sets ( Hollywood credibly standing in for 12th century England - Carl Jules Weyl's art direction receiving another Oscar , with a third going to Ralph Dawson's exciting editing ) . It might well be the epitome of Hollywood entertainment during its golden era with the colorful legendary characters - all flawlessly enacted by one of the best casts ever brought together for one film - supplying comedy ( and not just that involving Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin , which I didn't find as icky as I remembered it ! ) , drama and romance ( Flynn and Olivia De Havilland's Maid Marian not only are cinema's last word on this famous fictional couple , but their pairing here also proved to be the highpoint of their lengthy on-screen collaboration which stretched to 8 films ) ; not forgetting , of course , countless unforgettable and stirring action scenes : the ambush in Sherwood Forest , the contest for the Golden Arrow , Robin's escape from the gallows , the final storming of the castle ( highlighted by one of the best-remembered duels ever to grace the silver screen between Flynn and Basil Rathbone's Guy of Gisbourne ) , etc . Interestingly , three actors - Rathbone , Eugene Palette and Montagu Love - would go on to co-star together again in another equally renowned swashbuckler , THE MARK OF ZORRO ( 1940 ; which I also just rewatched ) : Love , then , can be seen as well in yet one more similar film - the definitive 1937 version of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA ( which is forthcoming on DVD from Warners as part of a " Literary Classics Collection " and coupled with its inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake ) ; incidentally , all of these classics virtually constitute the three top titles in the entire swashbuckling genre ! Curiously enough , the film was started by William Keighley ( apart from having helmed the Flynn swashbuckler THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER [ 1937 ] , he had been responsible for Warners ' previous venture into three-strip Technicolor GOD'S COUNTRY AND THE WOMAN [ 1937 ] ) . However , studio executives were dissatisfied with how the action sequences had turned out and summarily handed the film over to Michael Curtiz - who had directed Flynn in his two most popular vehicles up to this point , CAPTAIN BLOOD ( 1935 ) and THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE ( 1936 ) ; neither he nor Flynn , apparently , were happy with this decision as they despised one another : nonetheless they made all of 12 films together , several of them bona-fide classics . In the end , this has certainly made me want to pick up the " Errol Flynn Signature Collection " ( also featuring a documentary on the notorious star ) a . s . a . p . - especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately , given that a second set is actually coming in March ; that said , of the 10 films included , only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL ( 1938 ) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium ( rather than in the worn , and often colorized , prints I've had to make do with up till now ) ! Needless to say , there have been scores of films about this popular character and , going by the IMDb , apart from the afore-mentioned 1922 Douglas Fairbanks ROBIN HOOD , I've also watched the following : THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN ( 1952 ; a live-action Walt Disney version ) , SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST ( 1960 ; a Hammer Films effort directed by Terence Fisher and co-starring Peter Cushing as the Sheriff of Nottingham ! ) , ROBIN HOOD ( 1973 ; the Disney animated feature ) , ROBIN AND MARIAN ( 1976 ) , ROBIN HOOD ( 1991 ; TV ) and ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES ( 1991 ) . Still , the IMDb listings appear to be incomplete , as at least the first two among those I would like to watch are omitted : THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST ( 1946 ) , ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST ( 1950 ; Alan Hale's third and last stab at the character of Little John , following those of the 1922 and 1938 classics ! ) , THE MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST ( 1954 ; if only because it's directed by Val Guest ) , ROBIN AND THE 7 HOODS ( 1964 ; a musicalized version featuring The Rat Pack and reset to 1920s Chicago ) , A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD ( 1967 ; another Hammer Films variation ) , L'ARCIERE DI SHERWOOD ( 1970 ; a " Euro-Cult " obscurity directed by Giorgio Ferroni and starring Giuliano Gemma ) and ROBIN HOOD : MEN IN TIGHTS ( 1993 ; the inevitable Mel Brooks spoof which , amazingly , I've yet to catch up with in its entirety ! ) .
576651	1399158	40636	10.0	THE NAKED CITY ( Jules Dassin , 1948 )	I had watched this on Italian TV , but the last time was years ago ; it's a seminal noir , truly one of the finest examples of the genre ( and , arguably , Dassin's best film ) ? made in a semi-documentary style comprising compelling police procedural and remarkable location shooting . It was realistic where most preceding noirs had been expressionist ; this approach actually adds to the excitement ; on the other hand , the constant narration and the treatment of police officers ' domestic lives are the aspects which have perhaps dated the most . The film deservedly won cinematography and editing Oscars , but should have also been a contender in most top categories as well ? such as Picture , Direction , Actor ( Barry Fitzgerald ) and Script . THE NAKED CITY , therefore , was very influential and much imitated ? including one in which Fitzgerald had a similar role , UNION STATION ( 1950 ; which , consequently , I revisited the very next day ) ? and features a justly celebrated climactic chase and a legendary final line that's actually a cheat . The investigation of the central murder case also helped solve another ( the killer's own associate ) as well as a series of robberies involving Howard Duff ( who had been one of the desperate prisoners in director Dassin and producer Mark Hellinger's previous noir , BRUTE FORCE [ 1947 ] ) ? described by Fitzgerald as the worst liar he has come across in his long years of service ! Pint-sized Irish character actor Barry Fitzgerald really nails his part of Detective Muldoon ? bringing a mix of authority , warmth and humor to the otherwise grueling ( and often frustrating ) investigation ; it's also interesting that the case is cracked by the inexperienced assistant ( Don Taylor ) who , on a hunch , decided to follow a trifling lead . The scene involving an eccentric old lady ? who turns up at the police station claiming to be able to help , but whose contribution is totally worthless ? may well have inspired Thelma Ritter's Oscar-nominated role of an elderly ( albeit shrewd ) police informer in Samuel Fuller's gritty noir PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET ( 1953 ) . The film also features several noted character actors in small roles ? I recognized Paul Ford , James Gregory , Arthur O'Connell and David Opatoshu , but the IMDb mentions Kathleen Freeman , Nehemiah Persoff and John Randolph as well ? while Stanley Kubrick is said to have served behind-the-scenes as a stills photographer ! Unfortunately , the audio on the main feature ? of course , I rewatched this via the recently released Criterion " Special Edition " ? was kind of low for my taste ( particularly during the second half ) .
