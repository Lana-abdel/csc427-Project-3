576849	1399158	65750	1.0	The Fury Of The Wolfman ( 1970 ) BOM	Apparently , this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime ; as I said earlier , although I've always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschy's werewolf pictures , this atrocity served as my introduction and , as awful as it most certainly is , I still intend to pursue other entries in the series , albeit very gradually . Despite some high profile disappointments like Joe Dante's THE HOWLING ( 1981 ) , I love werewolf pictures in general but , to be honest , I quickly lost interest in this film's " plot " and just stood there gazing at my TV screen counting its absurdities as it were . There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona ( i . e . going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed , zombie-like state in the very next one - as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside , and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot . . . and , yes , I did know the reasons for this beforehand ) , as well as the " Phantom Of The Opera " look of the Wolfstein character ! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic !
577006	1399158	82363	1.0	FANTASIES ( John Derek , 1981 ; shot 1973 ) BOM	Bo Derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years ? and that's how it should stayed ! John Derek was a competent actor but , as a director , he's virtually the Ed Wood of erotic cinema ? not that this is especially explicit , considering that Bo ( atypically sporting dark hair ) was only 16 when the film was made ! John also wrote and photographed it ; the latter results in some decent footage of the Greek island setting against which the narrative is set ? but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious ! The character played by male lead Peter Hooten has been brought up with Bo's family : they grew up as brother and sister but , now in their teens , the couple discover they're attracted to one another ( but , as I said , don't expect any sexual fireworks ! ) . Still , the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness ? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view ( which , of course , it does at the finale ) ; Derek's is even nuttier ? she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub ! ! For the record , the couple are married by the end of the film . Also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of Bo ( and who , naturally , incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten ) . Occasionally , for no very good reason , we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles ( among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [ 1931 ] ) ! At the end of the day , while Bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming , it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness .
576066	1399158	56950	2.0	HERCULES AGAINST MOLOCH ( Giorgio Ferroni , 1963 )	This peplum has to be one of the low points of the entire genre : not only does it not generate any interest or particular excitement throughout ( most of the time I was merely confused by the plot overcrowded with factions , conspirators and usurpers ) , but the title itself is a cheat : Hercules doesn't really feature in it at all - it's merely the name under which hides muscle-bound hero Gordon Scott , actually the prince to a neighboring empire attempting to free Mycenae from the influence of paganism and the ruling corruption and sadism ; Moloch , then , is nothing like the man-eating God seen in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS ( 1927 ) but the disfigured heir - with his face hidden behind an iron mask shaped like a wolf's head ! - to the throne who's kept hidden in the dungeons ( with a line-up of drum-beating females as company ! ) and occasionally offered victims he can amuse himself with by shooting at them with arrows . Actually , the latter scenes are nicely atmospheric ( director Ferroni had earlier made the fine Gothic-horror piece MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN [ 1960 ] ) ; by the way , the minor peplum LE BACCANTI ( 1961 ) - also helmed by Ferroni - had featured a similar set of underground females , while some of the exterior scenes appear to have been lifted from the director's own - and vastly superior - THE Trojan WAR ( 1961 ) ! Interestingly , the villainous female lead is played by Rosalba Neri who's undeniably attractive but not yet the favored raunchy starlet of Euro-Cult ; also in the cast are Arturo Dominici ( as a despicable officer in Neri's service ) and Michel Lemoine ( in view of his unusual looks , it's surprising to find him on the side of the righteous and carry the film's secondary love interest to boot ! ) . Note : according to the DVD Drive-In review for Trimark's Box Set " The Adventures Of Hercules " , in which this film is included , it's written that Tim Lucas suspects that Mario Bava may have been involved in its making ; apart from the lighting scheme in the dungeon scenes with Moloch , as already mentioned , it's hard to agree with this - but , then , Bava's own peplums hardly constitute his best work . . .
576940	1399158	87451	2.0	THE ICE PIRATES ( Stewart Raffill , 1984 )	After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree : I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad ! Anyway , perhaps appropriately given the characters involved , the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN ( 1973 ) , ZARDOZ ( 1974 ) , LOGAN’S RUN ( 1976 ; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets ! ) , STAR WARS ( 1977 ) , ALIEN ( 1979 ) and MAD MAX 2 : THE ROAD WARRIOR ( 1981 ) ! The plot is simple but not exactly engaging : from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place – so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar ( ! ) rulers . Also involved is a beautiful princess ( Mary Crosby , daughter of Bing ! ) in search of her father , the deposed king ; by the way , the cast includes another famous offspring : Anjelica Huston ( daughter of John ) as one of the pirate band – thankfully , the actress’ mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an Oscar ( under her father’s guidance , no less ) for PRIZZI’S HONOR ( 1985 ) . Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the " Supreme Commander " , the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own – 78-year old John Carradine ( who’s seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene ! ) . The most notable bits ( for all the wrong reasons ) are : the alien using the toilet ; the castration machine ; the clumsy antics ( including karate-style combat ! ) of the inevitable robot companions ; the goofy slave / eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes ; the recurring attacks by the " space herpies " ( whatever that is ) ; the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp ( Crosby becomes pregnant , gives birth , and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds , while leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford stalwart Hank Worden for this scene ! ) – incidentally , the jump-cuts adopted here ( intending to denote the rapid passage of time ) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating .
576205	1399158	74478	2.0	Emanuelle In Bangkok ( Joe D ' Amato , 1976 )	Notorious film director D ' Amato's first entry in the " Black Emanuelle " series is somewhat better than its predecessor but , the version I watched on Italian TV is so sloppily trimmed that several sexy scenes end abruptly , thus making them quite senseless ! Here Emanuelle attracts the attentions of a Thai Prince ( Ivan Rassimov , of all people ) , her on-off archaeologist boyfriend ( real-life husband Gabriele Tinti ) , a world-renowned historian and a shy Thai bell-boy , as well as 4 ( ! ) females - an Oriental masseuse , a repressed American tourist ( played by the lovely Ely Galleani from A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN [ 1971 ] and BABA YAGA [ 1973 ] ) , Tinti's " official " schoolmarmy girlfriend and , most intriguingly , an American Consul's ( possibly manic-depressive ) daughter ! I say intriguingly because Emanuelle is shown really losing her head for the young , inexperienced girl ( almost up to the point that she starts considering forsaking her hedonistic lifestyle ) but , before you can say , " Copout ! " , she gets a call from her newspaper sending her off to Paris for another assignment ! ! By the way , towards the middle of the film , Emanuelle's Bangkok apartment gets broken into and she loses her passport and all her valuable rolls of film ( apparently because she was getting too close to Prince Rassimov who has a coup d'etat on his mind ) and , for good measure , there's some local color ( opium smoking and sensuous dancing ) and even animal cruelty ( in the form of a bloody mongoose vs . cobra duel ) . What the f !
577603	1399158	95952	2.0	DIAL : HELP ( Ruggero Deodato , 1988 )	This is only the fourth effort I’ve watched from this director ( whom I met and found quite genial at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-movie retrospective ) and also , possibly , the worst . As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER ( 1989 ) , which preceded it , this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time ! Here , in fact , we get a plot revolving around – I’m not kidding , folks – a killer phone ! Pretty but bland Charlotte Lewis – in her third film after PIRATES ( 1986 ) and THE GOLDEN CHILD ( 1986 ) – is a model who , apparently , has just ended an affair ; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but , every time the phone rings , all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond ( or some such crap ) . She befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who , conveniently , knows of an authority on paranormal activity ( William Berger ) – who , hilariously , explains that the negative energy which is unleashed , say , during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force ( I swear I ain’t making this up ) ! Among the highlights . . . er . . . lowpoints of the film are : the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times ( it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having Lewis go through her paces again , EXTERMINATING ANGEL ( 1962 ) - style ! ) , the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display , the apparatus of the heroine’s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill , the sarcastic cop who greets Lewis on reporting the strange occurrences ( " And what’s the toaster up to , I wonder ? " ) , the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth , and Berger’s own bloody demise ( with the phone affecting the pacemaker he’s fitted with and causing the doctor’s heart to explode ) ! The film’s climax is rather confusing and , apparently , finally sees all the ‘lost souls’ inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the ‘possessed’ office ( a lonelyhearts service ! ) . For what it’s worth , the score – by ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less – is effective enough , despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack .
577031	1399158	373751	2.0	BAD INCLINATION ( Pierfrancesco Campanella , 2003 )	Lamentable attempt at a giallo revival ? it gets most things wrong ( particularly the atmosphere so essential to this subgenre , completely negated here by flat TV style ) and should , in fact , have been called BAD FILM-MAKING ! For what it's worth , the cast includes three past exponents in the field : noted transsexual Eva Robins ( TENEBRE [ 1982 ] ) as a has-been TV star whose plan for a comeback coincides with a killing spree occurring in her apartment building ; Florinda Bolkan ( A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN [ 1971 ] , DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING [ 1972 ] ) as a crooked art dealer and painter with a fondness for violent themes ; and Franco Nero ( THE FIFTH CORD [ 1971 ] ) who gets an amusing but , at the same time , thankless bit as a disillusioned - magistrate - turned - street - preaching - bum ! Besides featuring one of the silliest murder weapons ever ( an architect's set square ) , dialogue is hilariously overwritten throughout and the young cast emerges to be generally inadequate ( even if virtually all of the performances here are stilted ) ? but , at least , it does manage a bit of the traditional nudity ( courtesy of two entirely gratuitous shower scenes ) and even throws in a few lesbian couplings as a bonus ! Finally , while it's kind of interesting that two of the three murders attributed to the serial killer aren't actually committed by the latter ( and , in fact , is never caught or even identified ) , it's quite stupid of him to add to his list of victims the incompetent magistrate who had hastily condemned an innocent man so as to appease the irate public opinion ! !
576679	1399158	370032	2.0	ULTRAVIOLET ( Kurt Wimmr , 2006 )	Incredibly , this one proved to be even worse than AEON FLUX ( 2005 ) , which I watched recently ! For starters , it looks - and feels - more like a video game than a movie ; besides , the bland futuristic setting and the trite plot ( concerning humans vs . vampires , again ! ) offer nothing at all new . Despite virtually non-stop action , this is mostly laughable - especially when considering just how many times heroine Milla Jovovich ( a veritable one-woman army ) is surrounded by scores of heavies , only to emerge unscathed from the carnage ; one rooftop scene even has them killing each other as she contrives to avoid all their bullets ! The impossibly slender star ( with her constantly bare midriff almost a character in itself ! ) is sexy but expressionless in her role ; while certainly the only eye-catching element in the film , ultimately , she's just a pale shadow of Uma Thurman in the " Kill Bill " movies ( ) ! A subplot involving child actor Cameron Bright - whose blood , ostensibly , is a weapon for the vampires ' annihilation but could also provide an antidote to their ' disease ' - doesn't help , especially when it descends into sentimentality . The scene when Jovovich opens a case ( shaped like a toilet basin ! ) she's been ordered to retrieve only to find the comatose boy inside is just too surreal for words ! ! At one point , the villain utters the line " What a pathetic picture ! " ; never was an unintended self-reference more truly spoken !
577641	1399158	67229	2.0	I DRINK YOUR BLOOD { Director's Cut } ( David E . Durston , 1970 )	This is considered a " Grindhouse Classic " ? the former it may well be , but the latter it definitely ain't ! The film was released as a double-feature with the re-issue of ZOMBIES ( 1964 ) , now renamed I EAT YOUR SKIN : both of these titles actually end up being misnomers , chosen strictly for their exploitation value . Again , this starts off with a rite ( Satanic rather than voodoo ) ? which here , too , has nothing to do with the rest of it ! The gang of youths concerned attack an uninvited girl and then take it up on her relatives when they confront them . Eventually , a young boy decides to avenge himself upon the group in a rather vicious manner ( feeding them meat pies from his family's bakery infected with the blood of a rabid dog ! ) ? and , unwittingly , unleashes an epidemic of madness and murder . The violence ( coupled with the foaming-at-the-mouth make-up ) is so unconvincing as to be laughable ? and , for added queasiness , there's a completely gratuitous scene involving a boa ! A measure of the film's contrived nature is the fact that the group takes quite some time to show the effect of the disease ( one of them is a nymphomaniac who ravishes a bunch of construction workers ? conveniently spreading the virus ? before expiring ) , but their victims all turn rabid at the bat of an eyelid ! One more unexplained factor is that each member of the Satanic cult develops a particular abhorrence of one another ? with their Indian leader dispatched by his former black pal in memorably grisly fashion .
577637	1399158	890870	2.0	SAW IV { Unrated Version } ( Darren Lynn Bousman , 2007 )	Director Darren Lynn Bousman must be doing something right to be handed the reins of three successive entries in the SAW franchise ; for the life of me , however , I can’t figure out what the damn thing is because it seems to me that the series is getting progressively worse with each new sequel . The fourth film , therefore , is the worst of the lot – not because it is the goriest ( which I don’t think it is , curiously enough ) but because it doesn’t make a lick of sense – at all ! The film-makes clearly assume that whoever ventures into this one is already familiar with the earlier movies but , frankly , I lost the plot completely a couple of times while trying to remember who every newly-introduced character is ( or was supposed to be in the prequels ) . As far as I know , the character of Jigsaw ( finally ) expired in SAW III ( 2006 ) but he is all over the place in this one , too ! – both under his real , normal identity ( in a series of flashbacks depicting the miscarriage of his child , etc . ) and in any number of his silly costumed video messages from beyond the grave ( or whatever ) . I don’t really need to go into all the gory details of the various torture sequences seen throughout but the dismemberment of the sadistic fat slob is perhaps the ( comic ) highlight ; still , Jigsaw’s schemes are always so incredibly tortuous that , more than anything else , they make him seem like an elderly , human and more successful version of Wile E . Coyote ! ! Angel of vengeance-cum-serial killer , my eye . . .
577651	1399158	64443	3.0	THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR ( Michael Armstrong and , uncredited , Gerry Levy , 1969 )	I wasn't expecting much from this one , given that I had been let down by the director's subsequent - and signature - film , the notorious MARK OF THE DEVIL ( 1970 ) ; I would still like to watch HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS ( 1983 ) , however , which Armstrong only scripted ( it was directed by Pete Walker and featured genre stalwarts Vincent Price , Christopher Lee , Peter Cushing , John Carradine and Sheila Keith ) . Similarly , the fact that the majority of the cast was made up of juveniles ( with Frankie Avalon - referred to in the film as " the epitome of Swinging London " ! - the most experienced among them ! ) wasn't exactly enticing ; however , at least a couple of the girls - Jill Haworth and Gina Warwick - don't register too badly under the circumstances and , interestingly enough , a pre-stardom David Bowie had originally been slated for the role of the killer ! As for Dennis Price , he's wasted as the investigating officer ; the role , insignificant as it was , had been intended for Boris Karloff - but he was too ill to appear , and died not long afterwards . Anyway , the end result is a truly lame film full of obnoxious characters ( particularly the couple that's supposed to provide comic relief ) , wooden acting . . . and pointless zooms onto the Gothic architecture of the titular house ! Surely the best thing about it is the rapid editing of certain sequences ( a couple of brutal murders , a suspenseful scene at a gallery ) , in which the director admits - during the Audio Commentary - to being influenced by the work of Sergei Eisenstein ! Reg Tilsley's score - except for a terrible song near the beginning composed by Gerry Levy ( more on him later ) - is quite good . . . and the ending offers a couple of surprises as well , but all this isn't enough to salvage the film ! It was released in the U . S . as a double-bill with CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR ( 1968 ) , which I watched for the very first time only a couple of days prior to this one . Writer-director Armstrong's Audio Commentary was very interesting , however , because he went into great detail about how the film was taken out of his hands by AIP ( it was made in conjunction with Tigon ) and changed considerably : a new director - Gerry Levy - stepped in , generally softening the characters and toning down the sex ( which became practically non-existent ) and violence ( one bloodless killing was clearly his work ) , but also adding a new subplot involving an extra-marital affair between Warwick and George Sewell ! It's very probable that the original version made a better film altogether , but there's little to suggest that it would have been anything special - despite Armstrong's vehement , denigrating comments throughout about Levy and AIP's Louis M . ' Deke ' Hayward ! Ironically , the exact same thing happened to Armstrong on his second film ( the intrusion this time around came from producer Adrian Hoven ) , which basically put him off directing for good - though his bad experience during the making of THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR did translate into a feature-film script , ESKIMO NELL ( 1975 ) ! Interestingly , I followed this with the only film Gerry Levy directed by himself - THE BODY STEALERS ( 1969 ) - which , being a Tigon release as well , it ended up as part of the same Box Set with THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR ! Needless to say , Armstrong had no kind remarks about Levy's film ( despite the presence in it of one of my favorites , George Sanders ) - but I'll comment on that film in its own brief space . . .
576087	1399158	56472	4.0	GLADIATORS SEVEN ( Pedro Lazaga , 1962 )	Although only a few days have elapsed since I've watched this one , I've already forgotten practically everything about it ? as my memories of the film seem to have melted into all the other peplums I've been watching of late ! Obviously , from the title one can gather that it's basically a transposition of the SEVEN SAMURAI ( 1954 ) / THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN ( 1960 ) plot to the Roman Empire ? and the rating suggests that I found it to be a middle-of-the-road peplum , not very good perhaps but not especially bad either . Richard Harrison is the lead here and , while he may not have much range as an actor , at least he's not as wooden as Dan Vadis ; as a matter of fact , over the last week , I've watched two films ? and both , incidentally , turned out to be more or less of the same quality ? by either of these Euro-stars . I do recall , however , that the print utilized for the DVD transfer of GLADIATORS SEVEN was perhaps the best of all the English-dubbed peplums I rented and , surprisingly enough , it was presented in the correct aspect ratio ( unlike the majority of the titles , which were available only in horrendous pan-and-scan editions ) .
577529	1399158	66315	4.0	Roy Colt And Winchester Jack ( Mario Bava , 1970 )	While this comic Spaghetti Western was nowhere near as bad as its low reputation amidst the director’s canon would seem to suggest , it can’t possibly hold a candle to Sergio Leone’s classic THE GOOD , THE BAD AND THE UGLY ( 1966 ) – and it would be puerile for anyone to attempt comparisons of this sort ! It’s the last of Bava’s three such genre efforts but , actually , the first I’ve watched ; I used to think that he was constrained within the number of relatively low-brow peplums he made , but even those showed greater commitment – and vigor during the action sequences . Here we get plenty of brawling and shooting , to be sure , but the handling throughout is decidedly sloppy . . . as if Bava , rather than be inspired by these traditionally ‘big’ moments , wanted to get such genre requirements out of the way ! That said , despite utilizing a wide variety of locations in its plot about two rival outlaw gangs’ quest for gold , these don’t seem to have stimulated the director’s trademark compositional skills ; even worse , the comedy element comes across as heavy-handed most of the time , resulting in a flat and drawn-out film ( even if it runs for a mere 85 minutes ) ! Brett Halsey ( from Bava’s FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT [ 1969 ] ) and Charles Southwood don’t exactly generate fireworks in the title roles and , in fact , the best in the cast are Marilu ' Tolo as Winchester’s spirited ( and shrewd ) Indian girl and Teodoro Corra ' as The Reverend , the atypically buffoonish baddie – a Russian émigré who still can’t get over the cold of his native land . Isa Miranda ( who would work again with Bava when he treaded more familiar ground in BAY OF BLOOD [ 1971 ] ) appears as the brothel Madame in what is perhaps the most slapsticky and forced set-piece in the entire film . Hardly memorable in itself , there are still a few mild highlights in this reasonably agreeable , innocuous yet patchy genre offering : the spastic gunman at the beginning , the obviously fake snake which menaces Winchester ( reminiscent of the one in Fritz Lang’s THE Indian TOMB [ 1959 ] ) , the exploding villain , and the final shot with the heroes’ feet up in the air as they engage in yet another fisticuff . Piero Umiliani’s lively score certainly contributes to the film’s characteristically light touch .
576698	1399158	70235	4.0	I WILL WALK LIKE A CRAZY HORSE ( Fernando Arrabal , 1973 )	This was my third Arrabal movie after VIVA LA MUERTE ( 1971 ) and THE GUERNICA TREE ( 1975 ) ; all three were released as a DVD Collection by Cult Films – however , I came to own all of them via alternate formats . . . which , frankly , saved me from doling out my hard-earned cash for the set ( especially since I only really liked THE GUERNICA TREE ) ! To be honest , Arrabal has here reconfirmed himself an exponent of the kind of Surrealism which I find hollow , ostentatious and positively grating – much like the work of his contemporary Alejandro Jodorowsky ( though in his case I’m , as at least I’m partial to two of the four films I’ve watched so far ) . Mind you , as I’ve said more often than I care to remember , my all-time favorite film-maker is Luis Bunuel – perhaps Cinema’s foremost Surrealist – and the art form itself is one I feel to be most congenial to the language of film . . . but not when it resorts to emetic , shocking-for-shock’s sake detail ( such as the pointless images here of ejaculation , scatology , various sexual perversions , and ending with cannibalism ) ! What little plot there is concerns a murder mystery , which then develops into a chase when the victim’ own son is somehow targeted as the perpetrator ; the unsubtly-named Police Inspector Gay follows the handsome anti-hero into the desert , where the latter meets a magically-endowed dwarf . In spite of the danger , the man returns to the city ( Paris ) and takes the little man along : the latter’s incongruity with his surroundings – he’s a shepherd who never caught up with the modern world – is fairly perceptive and , even if the midget’s behavior is generally nothing short of obnoxious , this constitutes just about the only tolerable aspect of an otherwise grossly self-indulgent film . For what it’s worth , everything comes to a head when one character takes over the personality of the other ! Incidentally , given the number of ‘humiliating’ scenes she appears in , it’s baffling how a respected actress like Emmanuelle Riva ( playing the mother ) allowed herself to be involved with this kind of extreme stuff ! And , just as much of a paradox is the fact that , for all his intended savagery and pointed irreverence , Arrabal gives the film a curiously polished look – which is accompanied besides by a quite agreeable soundtrack ( highlighting gibberish children’s vocals ) . . .
576744	1399158	368774	4.0	The Heart Is deceitful Above All Things ( Asia Argento , 2004 )	Argento's second directing effort is as self-indulgent as the first but , at least , the American setting and some surprise cameos give it a more ' professional ' look . With regards to her personal contribution , she would perhaps have done better to give the role she eventually played to another actress ? so that she would have concentrated on the directing ? but , at least , her tenure in the U . S . has undoubtedly improved her English ! Still , as was the case with SCARLET DIVA ( 2000 ) , the film is basically a compendium of social and sexual disorders : the leading character is actually the son of the woman played by Argento ? incarnated in its various stages of growing-up by three different actors ! ? and he goes through parental neglect , bad influence ( from his free-spirited ? make that hooker ? mum and the various low-lifes she brings home or meets on the road ) and abuse ( of both the physical and sexual kind ) ! Perhaps its most excessive ? and would-be provocative ? episode is that featuring notorious rocker Marilyn Manson ( sans make-up ) when he seduces the boy who , having been ' transformed ' into a girl by his mother for no reason at all , he imagines to be Argento herself ! ! Then again , the film is extreme in its viewpoint : apparently , the only alternative to the unwholesome background provided by the boy's mother is that of a group of fanatical Evangelists ( headed by Peter Fonda and Ornella Muti , playing his grandparents ) ; there's a funny scene here , though : asked what psalms he knows , he says that he can't recite any but has learned the words of a few songs , promptly bursting into the Sex Pistols ' " Anarchy In The UK " ! Another hilarious moment ( perhaps unintentional ) comes with the obscene country song heard on the radio at one point . After 90 minutes of this , with the boy taken out of Argento's custody a number of times , they are re-united at the end and take once more to the road ? thus resolving nothing definitively , and making the whole venture more pointless than penetrating into the bargain ! Argento's interview on the R2 DVD I watched was a lucid and informative talk , but the accompanying one by the author of the book on which the film was based ? J . T . Leroy ? was a rambling piece which rather demonstrates that she is more adept ( and comfortable ) at communicating her thoughts via the printed page !
577308	1399158	757061	4.0	MASTERS OF HORROR : IMPRINT ( TV ) ( Takashi Miike , 2006 )	I saw a bit of Japanese cult director Miike at the 2004 Venice Film Festival , though I hated his own contribution to it i . e . IZO ; for the record , this opinion is true of all that I've checked out so far from his incredibly vast ( and mostly sick ) body work and this latter venture into Miike's filmography certainly doesn't break the trend . It's easily the most extreme entry in the " Masters Of Horror " series , but also possibly the least ; incidentally , the TV-film's planned screening was eventually banned on account of its disturbing imagery ( not only graphic depictions of torture but the female protagonist is a " freak " ) and themes ( involving such taboo material as incest and abortion ) . Even if , typical of Asian films , the attention to period detail and the color scheme are notable , what really stands out here ( and this is not meant as a compliment ) is leading man Billy Drago's rampant histrionics and , even more so , the presence of the heroine's unforgettably ( indeed amusingly ) vile , misshapen evil twin . At the end of the day , the episode strives too much for significance by dealing with too many issues and ends up going on too long for its own good .
577152	1399158	87237	4.0	FANNY HILL { R-Rated Version } ( Gerry O'Hara , 1983 )	When I chanced upon FANNY HILL at the local DVD rental shop , I only had a vague notion of either this version existing or of what the " classic " novel was about ? but since American sexploitation maverick Russ Meyer had made it into an intriguing movie himself back in 1964 , I figured it was a bawdy period romp and , since I had been in a costume picture state-of-mind for a while now , I decided to give it a spin . The presence of three veteran film stars ( Oliver Reed , Shelley Winters and Wilfrid Hyde-White ) was also enticing but , unsurprisingly , they are only there for marquee value : Reed's almost incoherent Popeye-ish accent is simply embarrassing , likewise watching flabby madam Winters being surrounded by all that petite naked flesh ( not hers , of course , but that of her charges and their consorts ) flailing about , but it's octagenarian Hyde-White ( in his last film , no less ) who tops both of them by snuggling in bed with the title character ? who is all of 19 years of age ; I've seen Hyde-White in several of his earlier films and I'm positive he never performed a love scene in any of them ! Indeed , it's gorgeous leading lady Lisa Foster ? who , thankfully , indulges in much full-frontal nudity by shedding her clothing completely at every possible opportunity ? which , even in the heavily-censored variant I've watched , makes this consistently raunchy period piece tolerable ; it's a pity that she didn't get much ahead in her acting career as one would certainly have liked to see even more of her . Interestingly enough , she later switched to doing animation work and was also involved in the digital restoration of Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS ( 1937 ) ! The orphaned innocent Fanny Hill soon falls in with some ladies of ill-repute as she reaches London to better her prospects , and is immediately instructed in what is expected of her by a more experienced companion Phoebe ( Maria Harper ) by jumping into bed with her , and later spying on their fellow co-workers in action through hidden holes in the wall BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) - style ! In fact , the film's plot line is very similar to that of Jess Franco's MARQUIS DE SADE'S JUSTINE ( 1968 ) and it's small wonder that the producer of that one , Harry Alan Towers , is also behind this production but , while I'd say FANNY HILL is a more agreeable picture , ultimately it's just too blandly made to stick in one's mind for much longer after it's finished .
576285	1399158	78350	4.0	THE SWARM { Extended Version } ( Irwin Allen , 1978 )	This one is often often considered , along with WHEN TIME RAN OUT . . . ( 1980 ) , as Irwin Allen's nadir - not to mention one of the all-time worst films ! Michael Caine himself said it's the worst film he's ever been in ( contradicting his apparent enthusiasm shown in the accompanying promo ) - although he must have clearly forgotten THE ISLAND ( 1980 ) . . . Given the impeccable credentials , it seems that I keep giving it a chance - since this here was already my third viewing ( albeit the first via the extended version ) . It was also one of several ' attacking insects / small animals ' movies in the seventies - FROGS ( 1972 ) , PHASE IV ( 1974 ) , SQUIRM ( 1976 ) , KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS ( 1977 ) , EMPIRE OF THE ANTS ( 1977 ) , etc . ; other semi-notable bee movies are THE DEADLY BEES ( 1966 ) and THE SAVAGE BEES ( 1976 ; made for TV ) . They certainly spared no expenses where the cast was concerned : Michael Caine hams it up as a constantly fuming entomologist ; ditto for Richard Widmark's general ( who , at least , has the sense to not take it seriously ) ; Richard Chamberlain has a similar role to the one he played in THE TOWERING INFERNO ( 1974 ) ; Jose ' Ferrer turns up for a thankless one-minute cameo , whereas Cameron Mitchell appears unbilled . While it was nice to see all those Hollywood old-timers , the three-way romance between Fred MacMurray , Olivia DeHavilland and Ben Johnson was embarrassingly corny ! Incredibly , some 40 minutes were salvaged from the cutting-room floor to make up this inflated Extended Version - but the film seriously outstays its welcome in the second half , as it lumbers its way toward a ' philosophical ' conclusion . Apparently , several incidents in the film are ' inspired ' by THE KILLER SHREWS ( 1959 ) - but also THEM ! ( 1954 ) , especially the huge bug every victim kept seeing ( which is shown so often that it eventually becomes risible rather than scary ) . Even in spite of its great length , there are still a couple of blatant plot holes : Caine , Katharine Ross and Patty Duke Astin get locked inside a freezer during an attack on the town by the killer bees but we never learn how they manage to get out ; likewise , we're not told how the boy ( in whom Caine and Ross take a special interest all through the picture ) got ' sick ' again , a ' relapse ' he actually doesn't survive ! Ultimately , it's not the unmitigated disaster most people say it is - but the dialogue is so preposterous as to be unintentionally funny ( my favorite being Henry Fonda telling Caine that the raunchiest book he ever read was one the latter had written about the mating habits of the Queen Bee ! ) and the theme itself simply too far-fetched ( despite all the earnest sermonizing and the film's ecological stance ) ! INSIDE ' THE SWARM ' ( Andrew J . Kuehn , 1978 ; ) , included on the DVD , is a fluffy TV featurette made during production of THE SWARM : it ' s no great shakes and is mainly of interest for showing Irwin Allen at work during the 1970s ' " Disaster Movie " heyday . . . when the all-star cast are not trying to convince us that the film's earnest warning - that a catastrophic bee attack upon the whole of humanity is imminent - should not be taken lightly and we are therefore instructed to take every precautionary measure necessary ( the first being , I assume , to go watch the film at your nearest local theater ) !
576664	1399158	74776	4.0	THE LAST HARD MEN ( Andrew V . McLaglen , 1976 )	This one came out during the Western genre’s last gasp ; unfortunately , it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field ! To begin with , the plot offers nothing remotely new : James Coburn escapes from a chain gang , intent on killing the man ( now retired ) who put him there – Charlton Heston . While the latter lays a trap for him , Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter ( Barbara Hershey ) . Naturally , the former lawman – accompanied by Hershey’s greenhorn fiancé ( Chris Mitchum ) – sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers , all of whom broke jail along with him . Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-Fordian style , McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease : repellent characters , plenty of violence , and the sexual tension generated by Hershey’s presence among Coburn’s lusty bunch . Incidentally , Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western – the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE ( 1965 ; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD , though I recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off TCM UK ) . Anyway , the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for ( suggested also by the title ) : then again , both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most American of genres – WILL PENNY ( 1968 ) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID ( 1973 ) ! At least , though , Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be ; the latter , however , tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax ( relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of Hershey ) . Apart from the latter , this lengthy sequence sees Heston try to fool Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID ( 1961 ) , the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists ( as was his fashion , Heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice ! ) . The supporting cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffectual town sheriff , Jorge Rivero as Coburn’s Mexican lieutenant , and Larry Wilcox – of the TV series CHiPs ! – as the youngest member of Coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over Hershey ( while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away ! ) . Jerry Goldsmith contributes a flavorful but , at the same time , unremarkable score .
577488	1399158	86984	4.0	BODY DOUBLE ( Brian De Palma , 1984 )	De Palma's thrillers are always worth watching for their instantly recognizable style - and even more for his myriad borrowings from the work of Alfred Hitchcock ! Here , however , he seems somewhat unsure of himself as he even turns to his own earlier films for inspiration : while the main theme of Craig Wasson as a voyeur clearly owes a debt to REAR WINDOW ( 1954 ) , his obsession over a woman comes from - what else ? - OBSESSION ( 1976 ; and , by extension , VERTIGO [ 1958 ] ) , the film-making milieu ( with the nostalgic title sequence being especially nicely done ) from BLOW OUT ( 1981 ) and the ruse of committing a murder in disguise ( in order to put the lead character - and the audience with him - off the track ) from DRESSED TO KILL ( 1980 ; and , obviously , PSYCHO [ 1960 ] ) ! Still , the mystery isn't particularly involving - though Wasson isn't bad in registering his character's curiosity and confusion , while being able to romance both the victim ( Deborah Shelton ) and her double ( Melanie Griffith ) - and , other than adding an extra element of sleaze , the porn subplot is more of a distraction than anything else ! The villain , too , is totally uninteresting which rather makes the resolution less compelling - though the excessive violence ( Shelton is pinned to the floor with a power drill ! ) , camera gymnastics and , above all , Pino Donaggio's typically wistful score certainly keep one watching . . . even if De Palma has clearly made better films !
578042	1399158	113690	4.0	LORD OF ILLUSIONS { Theatrical Version } ( Clive Barker , 1995 )	I'd been underwhelmed by Barker's signature film HELLRAISER ( 1987 ) ; however , since this was rated on the " Cult Filmz " website , I decided to check it out given that it was often shown on local Cable TV . As it happened , the film is available in two versions ( the original theatrical release at 109 minutes and the Director's Cut , running 122 ) and it's the former which I ended up watching ; incidentally , I had planned to include this in my Halloween horror schedule back in October ? but I only managed to get to it now ! Anyway , the film is a mix of noir and diabolism ( other similar examples are ANGEL HEART [ 1987 ] , which I still haven't caught up with but may be able to do so soon enough , and FALLEN [ 1998 ] ) : it's fairly intriguing during the first hour ? but , as I said in relation to other recent horror outings ( see my review of RE-ANIMATOR [ 1985 ] below ) , the intricacies of the plot get lost eventually in a wave of special effects and mindless gore ! The narrative concerns private eye Scott Bakula ( just off a case dealing with exorcism ) who's asked to investigate a series of deaths occurring within the individual circles of a couple of rival magicians ? the elder of whom seems to have gone too far and the other , a former student , is intent on putting a stop to his activity . The film opens with a prologue in which he does just that ( by way of a BLACK Sunday [ 1960 ] - type iron mask ) ? but , then , it transpires that a creepy acolyte who has escaped the initial onslaught is waiting for the opportune moment in which to revive him . In the interim , the younger magician has acquired prestige but the endeavor has also unbalanced his mind somewhat ? while the girl he saved from the hands of his nemesis , and who had subsequently brought about the latter's come-uppance , has become his wife ( played by Famke Jannsen ) . Unsurprisingly , however , their relationship isn't genuine and she gradually becomes involved with Bakula . The young magician fakes his own death ( via a stage act gone wrong involving a number of falling swords ) and , in the end , turns up for a final showdown with his old mentor ( the latter having himself disposed of the remaining members of his cult because he deemed them unworthy of his exalted state ) . Of course , Jannsen and Bakula get mixed-up in the fracas and narrowly escape with their lives . As I said earlier , this had the makings of a good occult thriller ? but , ultimately , is defeated by its own excesses .
577142	1399158	71568	4.0	GOLDEN NEEDLES ( Robert Clouse , 1974 )	Despite bringing together a newly-born film star – Joe Don Baker , fresh from the box-office smash , WALKING TALL ( 1973 ) – and action director – Robert Clouse , of ENTER THE DRAGON ( 1973 ) fame – this a lamentably lackluster martial arts flick about the search for ( or rather the chase after ) a bronze statue which contains seven golden all-curing acupuncture needles which is craved by various parties . Baker is a retired detective slumming it out in Hong Kong who is hired by an enterprising ‘cowgirl’ ( Elizabeth Ashley ) to look for the titular commodities on behalf of her mysterious employer . Baker comes in possession of the statue early on in the game but it is subsequently stolen from the house of an old Asian teacher of his who is murdered ; consequently , he teams up with his colored partner Jim Kelly ( saddled with an Afro hair-do typical of the era ) in L . A . to go after the bad guys – with a little help from a butt-kicking Asian policewoman and her colleagues . Hollywood veterans Burgess Meredith ( as the villainous old businessman who seeks immortality ) and Ann Sothern ( as a Hong Kong madam who takes punishment like a man to protect Baker ) bring some much needed spice to the largely indifferent proceedings .
578133	1399158	64470	4.0	LATITUDE ZERO ( Inoshiro Honda , 1969 )	This is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director Honda ( with more evidently elaborate sets ) ? though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them ( witness the giant bats and rodents on display ) . It also utilizes a surprising number of American actors : Joseph Cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill-at-ease and frail ( but , then , his character is supposed to be 204 years old ! ) , an innocuous Richard Jaeckel is the photographer hero while , as chief villains , we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina ( both essentially campy ) . As I've often said , I grew up watching English-language films dubbed in Italian ? but hearing Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing entirely ! LATITUDE ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Verne adventure , and is fairly entertaining on that level ; indeed , it's preferable to Honda's low-brow variations on the monsters-on-the-rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set-up in this case . The plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by Romero ? he was intended to establish himself in the underwater , technologically advanced city devised by Cotten ( to which the world's foremost minds are being recruited ) . We're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs , but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on Romero's cave ? in fact , Cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits ( via flames and laser emitted from his glove ! ) must surely count as the nadir of his acting career ; the other elder in the cast , Romero , is more in his element ? after all , he had been The Joker in the BATMAN TV series and movie of the 1960s ! Cotten has a scantily-clad blonde physician on his team , and is assisted by a hulking Asian ; Romero , on the other hand , is flanked by an Oriental femme fatale ? who , however , ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts ( the girl's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condor ? which is among the phoniest-looking creatures you ever saw ! ) . Apparently , a 2-disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very day ! !
576334	1399158	5336	4.0	La Folie Du Docteur Tube ( Abel Gance , 1915 )	It’s ironic that , of Gance’s more celebrated Silent work , this should be the one I watch first : it’s a one-reel short about a mad scientist – hence its inclusion in the " Horror Challenge " , though the tone throughout is distinctly comical ! The titular figure is played by Albert Dieudonne – later the incarnation of Napoleon in the director’s eponymous epic of 1927 – and who’s fitted here with an exaggerated domed head , which he finally shelters inside a cage ! Even so , its raison d’etre is Gance’s use of the wide-angle lens in depicting the disorientating effect on people when subjected to a drug ( in the form of dust particles ) concocted by the protagonist . However , this gimmick – which actually prevents one from following what’s going on ! – is kept up for an inordinate length of time : consequently , even at a mere 10 minutes , the gimmick outstays its welcome . . .
576084	1399158	66743	4.0	ACQUASANTA JOE ( Mario Gariazzo , 1971 )	Like SARTANA IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH ( 1970 ) , I watched this via C'Est La Vie's R2 DVD and , in hindsight , both film and disc are of similar quality . The lead is Lincoln Tate in the title role of the bounty hunter pursuing Ty Hardin's band of Renegade Union soldiers ; Richard Harrison appears as one of the latter's associates who later double-crosses him . Having watched so many Spaghetti Westerns this past week , the films ' plots get intertwined in my mind ? and , frankly , I can't recall much of what this one was about ! ; I do know that Hardin's gang carries with it a cannon to aid in their bank robberies and that his leadership is challenged at one point by a bald-headed associate whom Tate eventually dispatches with a horde of arrows in the style of Akira Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD ( 1957 ) . Hardin eventually joins forces with Tate to retrieve a stash of money hidden in a cave , and also involved is Hardin's half-breed ( and gun-toting ) woman ? who has her eyes on Tate as well . The director biography , included among the extras , makes some claim for him being a versatile film-maker but , personally , it's the first I've ever heard of him : his career spanned all sorts of genres from Spaghetti Westerns to crime thrillers , horror , sci-fi and even erotica ( as it turns out , he also made the sentimental drama THE BALLOON VENDOR aka THE LAST CIRCUS SHOW [ 1974 ] ? starring James Whitmore and Lee J . Cobb ? which , when released in Malta back in the day , proved a huge box-office success ) !
576727	1399158	48573	4.0	SABAKA ( Frank Ferrin , 1954 )	I only watched this film due to Boris Karloff's presence ; however , I don't know why he even bothered as his supporting role here gives him precious little to do ! Still , this juvenile Indian adventure is harmless enough - and mercifully short . Despite being filmed on location , it's pretty obvious that most of its jungle sequences featuring wild animals are actually stock footage ! I have to say , though , that for a kiddie film it's unusually mean-spirited : animals and human beings alike get burned alive , while Victor Jory as one of the members of a fire-worshipping cult is cruelly dispatched by his high priestess ( played by June Foray , more familiar to film and TV buffs as a voice artist in animation , and the only one who manages to enter into the spirit of the thing ) by leading him straight into the grip of a deadly cobra ! By the way , the lead character is named Gunga Ram ( I wonder how they ever came up with that one ? ) ! !
578017	1399158	52601	5.0	THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE ( John Gilling , 1959 )	Surprisingly enough , this proved to be a totally routine desert adventure from many of the same people behind ZARAK ( 1956 ) , of which THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE is only a pale shadow ; while no classic in itself , the inherent campiness of the earlier film rendered it irresistible ? but that has been replaced here by relentless dullness ( the extremely faded print I watched certainly did not help matters ) ! Victor Mature once again makes for a wooden ( and , having had his family murdered , humorless ) lead ; incidentally , the narrative spends more time with the obligatory young couple ( Anthony Newley [ ! ] and Anne Aubrey ) ? though Norman Wooland more or less serves the same function that Michael Wilding did in ZARAK . The writer-director of this one had actually written the latter and would return again to this milieu for Hammer's THE BRIGAND OF KANDAHAR ( 1965 ; which I may be watching soon at the same venue which hosted the screening of THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE itself ) . Incidentally , I have also just acquired KILLERS OF KILIMANJARO ( 1959 ) , yet another Warwick production centering around a fading Hollywood star ( Robert Taylor ) ? but also featuring the aforementioned Newley and Aubrey . Anyway , to get back to the film at hand : at a trim 80 minutes , I suppose it makes for passable unassuming entertainment but is also utterly forgettable ; for the record , it does climax in a lengthy ( and reasonably exciting ) skirmish ? even if the low-budget involved meant that the same sets as ZARAK would have to be used ( and probably some of its action footage as well ) ! As usual with this company , reading the credits I could not help but notice how producer Albert R . Broccoli , story writer Richard Maibaum and cinematographer Ted Moore would be far more inspired when they set out to make the initial James Bond extravaganzas a mere 3 years later ( by the way , a regular of that series , Walter Gotell , is the chief villain here who mortally wounds Mature at the finale but is himself despatched by the now understanding Wooland ) . For what it is worth , the biggest laugh this film got from the five-man audience who were watching it ( myself included , of course ) was when a heavy-set Indian henchman spat out what seemed like a bucketful of saliva at the British and clumsy soldier Anthony Newley almost slips in it ! !
577122	1399158	4181	5.0	JUDITH OF BETHULIA ( D . W . Griffith , 1914 )	This was something of a milestone ? denoting a leap for pioneer D . W . Griffith from his customary one or two-reelers to a then considerable length of 49 minutes in this version ( its length may vary on account of differing speeds utilized during projection of Silent movies ) as well as from a modern-day , or at least American , setting towards apparently unlimited scope . In that regard alone , JUDITH OF BETHULIA is worthy of attention ? but Griffith's Victorian sensibilities ( which he could never , or would not , shake off ) still ground it into the antediluvian quality of film-making which is perhaps the most common objection raised by certain viewers nowadays to watching Silent pictures ! Anyway , this was obviously inspired by the Old Testament tale in which a saintly woman sacrifices her dignity in order to release the Jewish people ( depicted as long-bearded stereotypes which would not go down well today ! ) from oppression by the Assyrian army : she ingratiates herself within the affections of King Holofernes , whom she gets drunk one night and decapitates ? after which the invaders disperse . Apart from a lengthy offensive outside the city walls , the running-time is padded-out with the plight of a young couple ( the boy is a brave warrior and the girl eventually enslaved inside the enemy camp ) and , also appearing from time to time , is Lillian Gish in a typical role symbolizing motherhood . Unfortunately , the print I acquired of this 95-year old title was extremely fuzzy ? rendering the elaborate and often chaotic visuals even harder to make out ? and it was accompanied besides by one of the most incongruous scores I have ever heard , approximating to a circus jingle ( complete with laugh track ! ) which one finds at its most jubilant when the on-screen events seem to demand emotions of an entirely different nature ! !
576875	1399158	66483	5.0	TRANSPLANT ( Steno , 1970 )	Grotesque , crude but often quite funny knockabout farce which outstays its welcome and does not always fully realize its satirical aspirations . The film deals with an American billionaire , who having married a luscious young wife some 50 years his junior , often breaks into sobbing fits at the sight of her ; it does not take long for us to learn that all is not well between them in the bedroom stakes and he decides ( with the aid of a computer and a coterie of advisers ) to have an organ transplant . No prizes in guessing which organ he is needful of . . . ! After a series of false starts , they arrive to the three final prospective candidates , all of which are , coincidentally , Italian . One is an idiotic but clearly well-endowed brute who , having been " gang-raped " by a group of Swedish female sunbathers , wants nothing else except to go back for more , another is an unassuming family man who happens to have 14 kids and is constantly being harassed by his avaricious relatives into accepting the " job " and , thirdly , a nouveau pauvre Sicilian aristocrat who spends the time dodging his creditors by day and bedding their wives by night ! They are put to several strenuous tests to prove their maximum virility during the course of which they naturally start having second thoughts about going through with the operation . . . The film , co-written by popular Italian comic and latter-day TV personality Raimondo Vianello , stars Carlo Giuffre ' as the impoverished Latin Lover and the diminutive Renato Rascel who , playing the mild-mannered but prodigious father , has much more screen time than his " Special Guest Star " billing would suggest . Director Steno ( real name Stefano Vanzina ) was an expert handler of comics having dealt with the likes of Toto ' , Alberto Sordi , Nino Manfredi , Paolo Villaggio , Terence Hill , Bud Spencer , etc . - not to mention such Hollywood legends as Gloria Swanson , Orson Welles , Christopher Lee and Peter Ustinov ! - throughout his long and distinguished film career .
578084	1399158	198624	5.0	SWORD OF DAMASCUS ( Mario Amendola , 1964 )	I recall a childhood viewing on Italian TV of a film entitled IL LADRO DI DAMASCO ( which , officially , translates to THE THIEF OF DAMASCUS ) ; over the years , having completely forgotten it , I was under the impression that the movie I’d watched was the 1952 Sam Katzman-produced effort ( which actually drops the article ) co-starring Lon Chaney Jr . – but , all of a sudden , this Italian peplum turns up on TV and it turned out to be the film I’d come across eons ago . . . Given the ultra-modest credentials , I wasn’t really expecting anything here but was merely curious to re-acquaint myself with it , if anything for purposes of nostalgia . However , the film emerged to be a harmless enough outing and , all in all , quite a pleasant romp : in essence , the plot transposes the roguish hero of many an Arabian Nights tale to Ancient Rome – typically , he ( played by bland but affable Tony Russel ) gets into all kind of scrapes but is always able to get out of them unscathed with cunning and the help of his devoted pal ( Ferruccio Amendola once again , who also happened to be the nephew of the film’s writer / director ! ) The main villain is a treacherous Syrian merchant who , in cahoots with the Roman governor , seeks to be made the first local potentate in return for revealing the identity of the patriotic rebels . As usual for such juvenile fare , this slimy individual has also set his eyes and heart on the local beauty whose true love , it goes without saying , is our thieving hero . Predictably , she is abducted to the former’s palace and is ingeniously saved by the comically black-faced and acrobatic intervention of Russel and Amendola ( who , in making up their gibberish Negrospeak , contrive to include contemporary Italian musical fads like " Ully Gully " and " Dadaumpa " ) ! ! The elaborate climax involves a free-for-all confrontation between Romans and Syrians and , when all seems lost ( including Russel’s head to the executioner ) , a tell-tale bodily scar reveals the thief’s true patrician lineage !
576367	1399158	47298	5.0	ONE GOOD TURN ( John Paddy Carstairs , 1954 )	As I had been expecting , the second Norman Wisdom vehicle was more of a sentimental comedy - since it finds him taking care of an orphanage ( again , a favorite theme with star comedians ) which is set to be torn down by ruthless developers - and , in fact , there is an excess of pathos present , especially in Norman's relationship with a lonely ( and very uncharismatic ) boy . However , on the upside , this turned out to be quite a plot-packed and gag-filled film , though it runs out of steam towards the end . The level of invention is certainly average ( though already a few gags and plot details are reprised from its immediate predecessor , TROUBLE IN STORE [ 1953 ] ) , notably the trip to Brighton culminating in a marathon walk , Norman's hilarious stint as an orchestral conductor ( even if it's a situation that's been done to death , and the subsequent destruction of the stage was practically ripped off The Marx Bros . ' A NIGHT AT THE OPERA [ 1935 ] ) and the star's myriad attempts to raise money in order to buy the boy a motor-car he had promised him . Interestingly , watching Wisdom at work here immediately after MORGAN - A SUITABLE CASE FOR TREATMENT ( 1966 ) irresistibly draws parallels with David Warner's own child-like behavior in that film ( albeit dealt with , obviously , in a more adult manner ) .
576928	1399158	63587	5.0	PAYMENT IN BLOOD ( Enzo G . Castellari , 1967 )	This was the fifth ( ! ) Spaghetti Western I've watched from director Castellari ( whom I met at the 2004 Venice Film Festival ) ? it's not too bad an effort actually , though still far away from the admirably elegiac quality he would eventually achieve in KEOMA ( 1976 ) . The plot is pretty typical of the genre : after the end of the Civil War , a Confederate Colonel ( Guy Madison ) wants to keep up the fight and recruits a band of outlaws to finance his campaign through random pillaging ; given that the original Italian title makes an explicit reference to the fact that the gang totals seven men , I guess the film intended to be a roguish version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN ( 1960 ) ! Anyway , as expected , an outsider ( Edd Byrnes ) soon joins their ranks ? after having rescued one of them ( Enio Girolami , the director's brother and who , in the role of a peon , irritatingly speaks almost exclusively in Spanish throughout ! ) . However , it transpires ( equally unsurprisingly ) that he's really a government agent out to ensnare Madison and his men by ostensibly leading them to a buried cache ' of Confederate money ! Along the way , a female character is also thrown into the fray ? which , naturally , causes discord among the Colonel and his ' underlings ' since , rather than share her with them as was their habit , he decides to keep her for himself ; at the end , she too turns out to have been on the side of the law ( and in cahoots with Byrnes all along ) ! The film features plenty of action ? set to a rousing score by Francesco De Masi ? and climaxes agreeably with an atmospheric sequence set inside a cave ( where the now worthless money is stashed ) that served as burial ground for some Indian tribe or other .
577822	1399158	949731	5.0	THE HAPPENING ( M . Night Shyamalan , 2008 )	One of my pet peeves has always been when movies have identical names but absolutely nothing else in common with each other ; this is just such a case since , back in 1967 , Elliot Silverstein had already directed Anthony Quinn and Faye Dunaway in a now-forgotten hippie kidnappers comedy which , incidentally , I’ve caught on Italian TV ages ago . Typically for M . Night Shyamalan’s recent movies , his latest offering was coolly received by both critics and audiences but I actually thought that , at least for the first hour , it was pretty good . Hell , even Mark Wahlberg gets better with each successive film I see him in – or at least seems more tolerable as a leading man here than in that deplorable PLANET OF THE APES remake from 2001 ! Like the director’s previous films THE VILLAGE ( 2004 ) and , to a lesser extent SIGNS ( 2002 ) , this one also has an intriguing premise which is , however , marred by an unsatisfying denouement . In any case , the film’s would-be apocalyptic feel and the eventual discovery of its natural aggressor bring to mind equally modest ( but vintage and decidedly superior ) sci-fi outings like PANIC IN YEAR ZERO and THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS ( both 1962 ) . The belatedly introduced ‘redneck granny’ character was hard to take at times and , besides , as often happens to me while watching disaster movies , I break out in giggles every time there is depicted an event of mass hysteria ( which come in droves here ) . One does wonder at this point , though , where Shyamalan’s career might possibly be headed since he has basically been stuck in the same allegorical / apocalyptic fantasy rut for far too long now . . .
577471	1399158	65073	6.0	TASTE THE BLOOD OF Dracula ( Peter Sasdy , 1970 )	For being the first Hammer film I ever came into ' contact ' with ? almost 25 years ago I had missed out on a local black-and-white TV screening ? it took me a hell of a long time to actually catch up with it ! ! TASTE THE BLOOD OF Dracula emerges as Hammer's oddest Dracula entry , arguably even more so than the 1970s updatings ; though rather sluggishly paced , the film is too different to be ignored ? even if the execution itself is decidedly clumsy ! Frankly , it was dispiriting to see Christopher Lee's most demeaning stab at his signature role ( especially after recently witnessing his effectively understated contribution to Jess Franco's COUNT Dracula [ 1969 ] ) . While the film opens with an ingenious and arresting reprise of Lee's spectacular demise from Dracula HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE ( 1968 ) , his revivification ? a pile of dust cracking open ( ! ) to reveal the vampire ? is kind of laughable ( even if the shot of his blood-red eyes is , in itself , undeniably creepy ) . Otherwise , he's not even all that interested in blood-drinking ? since his main focus seems to be on avenging the death of his disciple ( Ralph Bates ) , while uttering a few lines of witless dialogue ! ! Normally , it would be far-fetched for Dracula to even bother with Bates , but one has to understand that the vampire was supposedly inhabiting his body ? that is to say , here we have virtually the same situation as in FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMEN ( 1967 ) . Bates is a compelling presence ( incidentally , his role was intended to be bigger but Hammer thought best to stick with Dracula ? and Lee , begrudgingly , accepted ! ) though he eventually overstays his welcome ? particularly with his weird inflection of the satanic verses spoken during the hysterical titular ceremony , where his scheme to impress a trio of hypocritical ageing thrill-seekers rebounds on himself . Still , following Bates ' uncomfortable exit halfway through , the film goes slowly downhill . The young folk ( with the boys sporting ridiculous haircuts ) are quite boring ? apart from the luscious ( if somewhat plump ) Linda Hayden ? though , for once , they serve a purpose as , rather perversely , Bates ( through Dracula ) uses them to execute his designated victims ! Incidentally , while the kids seem to be inseparable , their parents act like strangers to one another so as to cover their clandestine immoral association ; John Elder has inserted a pointed critique of Victorian society into his script , but it comes off as half-hearted amid the traditionally naive Hammer formula . The version I watched was the recently restored one released to DVD by Warners , which includes previously snipped footage of gore but also has an extended incongruous brothel scene ? complete with effeminate host , a bit of nudity and a completely gratuitous snake dance straight out of a Ken Russell film ! ! One of the prostitutes here is played by Madeleine Smith , who would soon appear in lead roles for Hammer in THE VAMPIRE LOVERS ( 1970 ) and FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL ( 1974 ) . The climax , then , is a major disappointment : Lee's exit from the desecrated church ( in which he came back to life to begin with ! ) is barred by crucifixes strategically placed by the heroic young couple ? he goes berserk , is hit by a sudden attack of vertigo and just drops dead on the altar ! ! Incidentally , isn't it silly that nobody seems to believe in or even know anything about vampires , but always happen to have some ancient tome in their library on which to fall back on when danger strikes , and immediately turn themselves into expert vampire killers ? The film is , however , blessed with an above-average cast which also includes Geoffrey Keen ( as Hayden's father and the stuffiest of the elderly English ' gents ' ) , Hammer regular John Carson ( as one of his two companions , who loses a daughter to Dracula ) , Roy Kinnear ( as the businessman who finds a way of profiteering even from the remnants of the vampire Count ) ; Michael Ripper has a more interesting role than usual as the police inspector , but he's still underused . Needless to say , we also get the usual Hammer attributes of low-cost production values and a typically effective James Bernard score . Finally , watching the film has decided me on ? at long last ? acquiring HANDS OF THE RIPPER ( 1971 ) , Sasdy's last effort for Hammer , via Network's " Special Edition " R2 DVD . . .
576585	1399158	56404	6.0	LOVE ON A PILLOW ( Roger Vadim , 1962 )	While their short-lived marriage was long gone , this is the fourth of five Roger Vadim / Brigitte Bardot collaborations and only the second I've watched myself . After opening in a light comedy vein , this rather scrappy film turns into an unappetizingly ponderous melodrama on the lines of LA DOLCE VITA ( 1960 ) , complete with a risibly " beat " orgy sequence and a surfeit of pretentious chat ; nevertheless , the whole is somewhat redeemed by the attractive Italian locations in its second half and the nice musical score throughout . For what it's worth , it tells of a bourgeois girl ( Bardot ) ? shortly to be married to an unassuming young man ? travelling from Paris to Dijon to hear the will of her late aunt , who accidentally stumbles on the suicide attempt of a bohemian , pulp-thriller-loving misanthrope ( Robert Hossein ) who , upon recovering , literally turns her life upside down . The cast is completed by James Robertson Justice ( as Hossein's sculptor friend ) , Macha Meril ( as Robertson's tramp companion ) and , in one sequence , Michel Serrault as a notary . In the end , the original title of THE WARRIOR'S REST sounds far more interesting that what's on offer here and the fact that I was misinformed about the film's running time ? I thought it was a good 22 minutes shorter ! ? did not help to earn it much affection from my end . But , then , the sight of Bardot in her prime ( and , Vadim being Vadim , in various stages of undress as well ) is always welcome . . .
576898	1399158	52604	6.0	THE GIANT OF MARATHON ( Jacques Tourneur and , uncredited , Mario Bava , 1959 )	A momentous collaboration between two ( past and future ) masters of the horror genre which should perhaps have been made in that particular field , especially since the overall effect ( as with most Italian low-grade epics ) is somewhat juvenile - unlike either's best work - but also because there are no monsters involved ( unlike , say , THE GIANTS OF THESSALY [ 1960 ] ) ! Steve Reeves and Sergio Fantoni make for an above-average hero and villain ; Daniela Rocca fares a lot better here than she would do in COLOSSUS AND THE AMAZON QUEEN ( 1960 ) ; and Mylene Demongeot is one of the loveliest heroines in all peplums , evoking memories of the early Brigitte Bardot - who had herself appeared in a supporting role in HELEN OF TROY ( 1955 ) , one of many film versions centering around another legendary Greek battle ( among them THE Trojan HORSE [ 1961 ] , starring Reeves himself and which I watched later on in my peplum marathon ! ) . The slow-starting film ( which , thankfully , features no intrusive comic relief ) eventually picks up with the impressive battle sequence , which occupies about half its length ! Bava's camera-work is exemplary and his special effects are apparent in the over-the-top violence , particularly towards the end .
575936	1399158	439815	6.0	SLITHER ( James Gunn , 2006 )	Once one gets past the " Oh , no . . . not another flesh-eating zombie flick " factor , this is quite an engaging and effective mish-mash of Romero's LIVING DEAD films , attacking bugs movies like Jeff Lieberman's SQUIRM ( 1976 ) and even more cerebral stuff like David Cronenberg's SHIVERS ( 1975 ) ! The special / make-up effects here are among the grossest ever - the creature Michael Rooker eventually turns into , the massive fat entity his " girlfriend " becomes and the repeated scenes of bugs entering people's mouths - but this is partially redeemed by a smart script and amiable performances , especially the foul-mouthed Mayor played by Gregg Henry and leading lady Elizabeth Banks as Rooker's wife ; Tania Saulnier's good looks certainly don't hurt either . Having said that , leading man Nathan Fillion is quite bland and his lifeless delivery of lines makes some of the jokes fall flat . . .
576753	1399158	87995	6.0	REPO MAN ( Alex Cox , 1984 )	This is a cult sci-fi comedy that is highly regarded in some circles but one which I never had the opportunity to watch before now ; as usual with such ' modern classic ' fare for me , while I liked it well enough , its uneven tone and general bleakness cause it to fall short of its reputation . A punk kid is reluctantly roped in as a Repo Man , a renegade band of people who repossess unpaid-for cars ; their workforce includes world-weary Harry Dean Stanton , secretary Vonetta McGee and philosophical caretaker Tracey Walter . While there's an admittedly witty script replete with four-letter words , we also get some gratuitous grossness ? such as having Emilio Estevez vomiting ( for no good reason ) after a chase on foot ! Typical of writer-director Cox , the soundtrack is full of rock / punk songs ; appropriately , his next film ? SID AND NANCY ( 1986 ) ? would be a biopic of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his notorious girlfriend Nancy Spungen , which I might just acquire anyway now . The sci-fi elements involve an unseen ' alien ' locked inside the trunk of a car which is chased through the streets of L . A . by two rival bands of Repo Men ? a ' la MOTHER , JUGS AND SPEED ( 1976 ) that I've recently watched ? as well as the C . I . A . The meltdown experienced by anyone coming into contact with the ' alien ' resembles the explosively atomic climax of KISS ME DEADLY ( 1955 ) ? and a further tribute to that noir masterwork is the fact that the end credits here likewise read from down to up ! In any case , the flying finish ? with the now-sizzling car soaring skywards ? was a nice touch .
577366	1399158	56645	6.0	THE VALIANT ( Roy Ward Baker , 1962 )	This was one of a number of Italian WWII-set collaborations with English-speaking countries , a couple of which I watched recently ? namely THE CAPTIVE CITY ( 1962 ) and TORPEDO BAY ( 1963 ) . While the handling is fairly dull , the film's main plot develops into a sustained suspense situation as a British vessel ( commandeered by stiff-upper-lipped John Mills ) is planted with explosive charges by Italian naval officer Ettore Manni and his ( wounded ) companion , who are then imprisoned on the ship itself after refusing to give details of their mission including the whereabouts of the bomb itself . An underwater search at night fails to reap the desired results and Mills ? with the help of officer Robert Shaw ( who's married to an Italian girl ) ? determines to retrieve the necessary information which could save the ship and the life of more than a thousand men on it . Doctor Liam Redmond opposes his treatment of the P . O . W . s , but remains on board to cure the injured man even after the vessel has been evacuated . The explosion eventually occurs early the next morning ? when the ship was scheduled to set sail for war duty ; the film , then , ends with Mills awarding Manni for his integrity and loyalty to his cause three years after the fact . As I said , the film is generally interesting ( like the same director's DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK [ 1952 ] , it's mostly confined to a single setting ) though the interrogation / confrontation scenes do get repetitive ; it's also bogged down by resistible comic relief provided by two marines appointed to guard the saboteurs . P . S . I'd love to revisit Mills ' previous effort with Baker ( in all , they worked six times together ) i . e . the eccentric psychological Western THE SINGER NOT THE SONG ( 1961 ) ? which I acquired some time ago .
577792	1399158	66495	6.0	THE TWELVE CHAIRS ( Mel Brooks , 1970 )	I had first watched this as a kid on Italian TV and it must have seemed very different to me than the typical Mel Brooks film ( after all , THE TWELVE CHAIRS was only his second outing ) but , back then , I wasn't familiar with THE PRODUCERS ( 1968 ) either ; it was with his next effort , BLAZING SADDLES ( 1974 ) , that Brooks really found a congenial formula , i . e . parody , which would occupy most of his subsequent career . This was adapted from a popular Russian source much filmed over the years all over the world : in Britain as KEEP YOUR SEATS , PLEASE ( 1937 ) , with George Formby ( which I have just acquired but , alas , don't have time to watch at present ) , in the Hollywood as IT'S IN THE BAG ( 1945 ) , co-starring Jack Benny , the international production 12+1 ( 1969 ) featuring the last appearance of the ill-fated Sharon Tate and a starry cast ( Vittorio Gassman , Orson Welles , Terry-Thomas , etc . ) and there's even a Cuban version from 1962 by Tomas Gutierrez Alea ( which has recently been released on R2 DVD but which I have yet to acquire ) . Brooks ' version , then , is the only one I know of to utilize the original Russian setting which , in spite of generally amusing ( if overly familiar ) situations , rather makes for a dreary-looking film . For the most part , too , the show's more glum than fun ? with pratfalls uncomfortably rubbing shoulders with ( misplaced ) social conscience ! In any case , Ron Moody ( fresh from the success of OLIVER ! [ 1968 ] ) is ideally cast as an impoverished aristocrat in search of the family fortune sown into one of twelve chairs which have been sold to various parties following the 1917 uprisings . His co-stars are a dashing Frank Langella ( who , incidentally , I watched performing on a London stage in January 2007 and might well be up for an Academy Award next February in Ron Howard's film adaptation of that very play I saw him in , i . e . FROST / NIXON ) as a wily schemer , who plays it straight but is equally effective , and Dom DeLuise as the greedy priest to whom Moody's relative has confessed before expiring ; I suppose that his hysterical shtick and zany antics seemed funny at the time but it's rather overbearing to watch nowadays . Last but not least , Brooks himself cameos ( he'd appear in all of his own films from then on ) as Moody's loyal but befuddled servant .
575948	1399158	57085	6.0	FURY AT SMUGGLERS ' BAY ( John Gilling , 1961 )	The title tells all in this second-rate but enjoyable adventure on a popular subject ; star Peter Cushing gives it his all , as ever , and he's matched by a larger-than-life performance by Bernard Lee as the chief villain . Still , Cushing's previous collaboration with writer / director Gilling ? THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS ( 1959 ) ? had proved a lot more substantial ( despite being shot in black-and-white ) . Anyway , the remaining cast includes veteran George Coulouris , playing a French merchant convicted by squire Cushing as a wrecker , while John Fraser ( in the role of the latter's son ) and Michele Mercier ( as the Frenchman's daughter ) comprise the requisite love interest . Other notable characters to figure in the plot are a mysterious highwayman known only as " The Captain " and a young boy who goes by the name of Juma ( also the name of the actor ! ) , both of whom start off by being in cahoots with Lee and his gang but gradually change loyalties to emerge heroic by the film's conclusion . The widescreen print I watched ( culled from the Region 2 DVD ) displays some color fading but is otherwise pretty decent . In the end , when compared to the similar but superior CAPTAIN CLEGG ( 1962 ; with Peter Cushing in the title role ) ? which being a Hammer production is , unsurprisingly , a more horror-oriented venture ? this is unassuming family fare ; two more films in the same vein I'd love to catch up with ( both , incidentally , Hammer titles co-starring Christopher Lee ) but which have never turned up in my neck of the woods are PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER ( 1962 ; also directed by Gilling ) and THE DEVIL-SHIP PIRATES ( 1964 ) . . .
577724	1399158	60865	6.0	CIRCUS OF FEAR ( John Moxey , 1966 )	This film is living proof of the wonders a stunning-looking print on DVD can do to a film : when I first saw it ( in a dubbed version on late-night Italian TV ) , I had felt it was nothing more than average and dismissed it somewhat . Truth be told , a few weeks prior to this I had watched the other Christopher Lee / John Moxey film - THE CITY OF THE DEAD ( 1960 ) - by way of VCI's exemplary DVD edition , and perhaps I compared it unfavorably to this minor horror classic . I had long known Blue Underground were preparing a SE and I was not sure it was worthwhile for me to invest in it , but now I'm certainly glad I did because I enjoyed the film immensely ( even though I had my heart in my throat all the time , expecting the picture to freeze and break up any minute - which , thankfully , did not occur ! ) . It's still nothing great , I guess ( Lee certainly made many better films where his talents were more immediately in evidence ; the hood and the fairly ridiculous accent hamper his performance here somewhat ) but it's easily the best film from BU's " The Christopher Lee Collection " Set - and in fact it and the restored edition of THE BLOODY JUDGE ( 1970 ) , not forgetting the plentiful and wonderful supplements , save this relatively expensive purchase from being a wasted opportunity ( considering the low profile of all four titles in the Lee canon ) ! The plot is pretty convoluted ( I can certainly believe Jess Franco here when he said that Harry Alan Towers is a very good writer , not evidenced by the two Fu Manchu films ) : while the identity of the killer could have easily been established if one had thought about it for a while ( considering it follows the Agatha Christie maxim that the least suspicious-looking character is indeed the guilty party ) but , frankly , the film provides red herrings and new twists at every turn that when the final revelation is made , it still comes as fairly surprising ( it's perhaps harder to swallow that the buffoonish if clearly ambitious Eddie could be the delicious Margaret Lee's secret lover ! ) . The film also features an arresting opening robbery sequence and is beautifully shot for such a low-budget film . The music score is very atmospheric and the circus scenes consist mainly of stock footage but the lion-taming and knife-throwing acts inject a measure of excitement at appropriate moments . Casting is certainly above-average for this type of film ; there are some pretty good performances here : Leo Genn's above all as the amiable yet dogged Police Inspector ; Margaret Lee is more than a radiant beauty - despite her sluttish character , she was fairly sympathetic ( especially after having been threatened by a lion ) and I think that the film loses something with her sudden , tragic exit ; I liked Skip Martin a lot , amusingly named " Mr . Big " - he is a pretty interesting character to begin with ( sort of a cynical Chorus to the proceedings ) , and even more so for being involved in some shady business on the side , for which he gets his just desserts in the end ! ; Klaus Kinski is eminently watchable despite his limited role ( at least he does manage an effective death scene ) ; Cecil Parker added some nice but not overstated British humor ; Heinz Drache made for a pretty engaging hero ; Suzy Kendall , on the other hand , was more decorative than anything else - though , in all fairness , she could only do so much with her thinly-written role . As I've already mentioned , it's disappointing that Christopher Lee was not involved at all with this release ; an interview would have been nice . The gloved killer of this film brings up comparisons with the giallos being made contemporaneously in Italy , though it's nowhere near as violent ( in fact , this one is pretty tame in the scares / gore department ) . I did notice some flaws in the story : Christopher Lee taking off his hood when his mortal enemy ( Drache ) is beside him is a miscalculation , in my opinion ; ditto , we never learn how Drache finds Lee and Kendall's hiding-place in the cave so easily when we had just been told the Police had scoured the area thoroughly , bearing no results ! Also , Lee's death comes as a surprise : he is not the villain and if it was done because it was deemed ' obligatory ' , it was certainly a silly move ! I only saw the film for the first time a couple of years back but , for the life of me , I have no idea what constitutes the ' new ' 8-minute sequence which was supposedly unearthed for this release ? Can anyone shed some light on the matter ? The Audio Commentary is somewhat dry , though Moxey's enthusiasm for his films ( if not his memory of them ) is constantly felt throughout the discussion ; again , disappointingly , the cuts this film was subjected to are hardly mentioned and certainly not listed in any way - though , in all fairness , Moxey probably wouldn't have watched any of the export versions ( not recently anyway ) !
576273	1399158	35706	6.0	CALLING DR . DEATH ( Reginald LeBorg , 1943 )	I hadn't intended to purchase this Set - and only did so after constant prodding by Joe Karlosi ; in essence , these films are no worse than the lower-profile sequels of the Universal monster pictures , such as the follow-ups to THE MUMMY ( 1932 ) and THE INVISIBLE MAN ( 1933 ) . This was the first of six " Inner Sanctum " mysteries all starring Lon Chaney Jr . ( with his frequent voice-over linking them rather naively with the concurrent noir subgenre ) and featuring portentous - and hilarious - intros by a disembodied head in a crystal ball ! It's not too bad in itself , with the plot overly familiar but fairly involving - Chaney's mind goes blank one weekend and when he comes to , discovers his unloving wife has been murdered ! Of course , he's the chief suspect of dogged detective J . Carroll Naish ( the best thing about the entire film ) though it's the woman's lover , named Robert Duval ( ! ) , who's actually accused - and convicted - of the crime . The characters are all relatively engaging ( Chaney is a celebrated neurologist with beautiful Patricia Morison as his devoted assistant ) and the plot development plausible enough , making for an entertaining and fast-paced 63 minutes . The final revelation , then , is at once surprising and satisfying .
576687	1399158	26000	6.0	WOMAN HATERS ( Archie Gottler , 1934 )	I’m virtually a beginner when it comes to The Three Stooges : I’d seen a few of their films – and episodes from the animated series – as a kid ( this short being one of them , incidentally ) but not enough to rank them judiciously in the pantheon of classic comedy . Anyway , this has been advertised as " a musical novelty " – influenced by the work of Ernst Lubitsch , no doubt – with all dialogue written in verse ! In essence , it lies somewhere between Laurel & Hardy ( with the train setting recalling BERTH MARKS [ 1929 ] in particular ) and The Marx Bros . – but emerging , in the long run , as less sympathetic than either . The gang joins the titular club but Larry , practically blackmailed into marriage , attempts to keep his status from pals Moe and Curley – but can’t , because his spouse turns out to be a flirt who has her eyes on them as well ! Walter Brennan appears briefly as the train conductor . I have to say that the slap-happy antics of the comic trio gets tiresome after a while . To be honest , I wonder how I’ll be able to stick the relentless display of such childish behavior through 19 Stooges shorts I’ve got scheduled ( given that I’ve just acquired a copy of the official Columbia 2-Disc collection ) . . .
576536	1399158	60429	6.0	FRANKIE AND JOHNNY ( Frederick De Cordova , 1966 )	This is an oddity in Elvis’ filmography : a quaint but pleasing musical comedy based on the popular song which had already inspired a similarly-titled film from 1936 starring Helen Morgan – apart from being featured in the Mae West vehicle SHE DONE HIM WRONG ( 1933 ) and , again , as recently as Robert Altman’s A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION ( 2006 ) . The star isn’t entirely comfortable amid the 1890s riverboat setting , what with a few of his musical performances ( and especially his hairdo ) coming off as inextricably modern . Still , the plot – thin as it is – emerges to be quite engaging ( what with its backdrop of fortune-telling , gambling parlors , variety acts and costume parties and involving mistaken identities , misunderstandings , an attempted murder and a bar-room brawl ) ! The cast presents three notable female roles : Donna Douglas ( as Frankie ) , Nancy Kovack as Elvis’ red-headed lucky charm and the flame of his jealous boss , and Sue Ane Langdon as a ditzy " blonde " – who , along with Presley’s long-suffering sidekick Harry Morgan , turns out to be the most likable character as well as the purveyor of the film’s comic relief . Elvis’ best ‘new’ number is " Hard Luck " ; apart from the title tune , he also gets to sing the standard " When The Saints Go Marching In " ( while dressed in full military regalia ) ! The film is short enough at 87 mins . not to overstay its welcome , but the rather low-key presentation also prevents it from being anything more than unassuming entertainment . I wouldn’t classify it among the top-flight Presley vehicles , therefore , but it’s certainly superior to some of the bigger-budgeted ( yet simple-minded ) fluff he made over at MGM – this being a production from independent producer Edward Small released through United Artists .
578072	1399158	65839	6.0	Hoffman ( Alvin Rakoff , 1970 )	This is at once one of Peter Sellers ' least-known and more interesting vehicles ; the film is virtually a two-hander ? with Sinead Cusack ( daughter of actor Cyril and later Mrs . Jeremy Irons ) as the young girl blackmailed by a middle-aged colleague ( Sellers ) into becoming his lover , because he knows of her boyfriend's involvement in a robbery . While the film is considered a comedy , it doesn't sound like it from that synopsis ; it's really a character-driven piece on a serious theme ? mid-life crisis ? which has been treated several times over the years , though rarely in such perceptively intimate detail ( for which it was deemed tasteless at the time ) . The humorous element ( if one can call it that ) springs from the fact that Sellers ' character ? who had been fantasizing about Cusack for months ? doesn't have the courage to do anything with her once they're together ! Incidentally , Hoffman's innately cruel nature was so similar to the real Peter Sellers that one might be inclined to think that his dialogue was improvised ? but this wasn't the case ! With this in mind , the film can be seen as talky ( though Ernest Gebler's script , adapted from his own novel , does contain a smattering of good lines ) , low-key and claustrophobic ( the narrative strays only occasionally from Sellers ' flat , and the two almost never interact with other people ) ? not to mention repetitive and overstretched at 113 minutes ! One particular sequence included an ambitious shot lasting for some 18 minutes , which certainly belied the rumors that Sellers had suffered brain damage during that infamous incident from the early 1960s in which he suffered no less than seven heart attacks in one day . The film's happy-ending-of-sorts , then , is highly improbable ? but I guess it works well enough in this context ( given that Cusack's boyfriend is depicted as a one-dimensional character and , therefore , no match for the intellectual Sellers ) . Gerry Turpin's cinematography of the bleak London settings is one of the film's main assets , while the tone of romantic melancholy ? inherent in Ron Grainer's score and his Don Black-penned theme song , " If There Ever Is A Next Time " ( sung by Matt Monro ) ? infuses the whole film and even serves as exposition for the main narrative during its deliberately vague early stages . By the way , director Rakoff had already handled the same material as a TV production starring Donald Pleasance ; at his own admission , the film version was too slow ? because the pace seemed to be dictated by the lead actor ? and professed to having misgivings also about the choice of music . As for Sellers himself , he was so disappointed with the final result that the star offered to buy back the negative from the producer and shoot it again from scratch ( the film , in fact , was such a resounding flop that it wasn't shown in New York until 1982 ) !
577677	1399158	52744	6.0	THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA ( Anthony Asquith , 1958 )	An interesting but not particularly engaging George Bernard Shaw satirical play is given a serviceable cinematic treatment from director Asquith - who clearly had fared much better with PYGMALION ( 1938 ) - but , nonetheless , the film is buoyed by a good cast ( Leslie Caron , Dirk Bogarde , Alastair Sim . Robert Morley , Felix Aylmer , Michael Gwynne , Alec McCowen ) and production values ( cinematographer Robert Krasker , composer Joseph Kosma , costumer Cecil Beaton , production designer Paul Sheriff ) . As it happens , some performers acquit themselves better than others : Bogarde is fun as an impoverished but Machiavellian painter dying of tuberculosis and Sim and Morley are their usual pompous selves as two renowned " quacks " competing to treat him so to earn favors from his lovely wife ( an unfortunately out-of-her-league Caron ) .
577323	1399158	71507	6.0	FLAVIA , THE HERETIC ( Gianfranco Mingozzi , 1974 )	I first read about this " Nunsploitation " effort ? considered among the most extreme of its type ( infamously featuring a scene in which a naked girl climbs inside the hanging carcass of a cow ! ) ? in the Leslie Halliwell Film Guide , but became even more interested in checking it out in the wake of online reviews for the R1 DVD from Synapse . However , I somehow never got around to acquiring it ? chiefly because the print included was English-dubbed ? though , in retrospect , that's what the actors are speaking ( with leading lady Florinda Bolkan providing her own voice ) . Then , just last week ? coincidentally , on the very same day I acquired an even more obscure entry within the same genre ( albeit of a much-filmed source i . e . THE NUN OF MONZA [ 1969 ] ) ? I stumbled upon a copy of FLAVIA itself and , at this stage , I simply could not let the opportunity pass me by . The film's reputation for gory depictions of carnage and torture was not exaggerated but , seeing how these scenes are part and parcel of its unflinching portrayal of the Middle Ages ( stunningly shot in earthen tones by Alfio Contini ) , they do not feel gratuitous or sensationalistic ; besides , the whole comes wrapped in an evocatively beautiful soundtrack courtesy of future Oscar-winner Nicola Piovani . Bolkan , able to convey much without the benefit of dialogue , is impressive as ever : she convinces in her character's every facet ( including donning a soldier's armor ) , and this is possibly her signature role . Maria Casares ( best-known for playing Death in Jean Cocteau's ORPHEUS [ 1950 ] ) is animated and uninhibited , despite her time-ravaged looks a ' la Alida Valli : for the record , I thought she would be playing the convent's obligatory stern Mother Superior but is actually the one to inspire Flavia towards rebellion . Claudio Cassinelli appears as a Jew befriended by the heroine , whereas Anthony Corlan ( later Higgins ) ? of Hammer's 1972 outing VAMPIRE CIRCUS ? is the young leader of the Muslim invaders ( none of whom look remotely Arabic ! ) aiding the heroine in accomplishing her male / Christian-hating campaign ? until she rejects marriage and conversion to his own religion . While having undeniably greater significance and scope than most films of its ilk ( though the expected hysterical writhing is still present in the form of a wandering sect afflicted by the bite of a tarantula ! ) , plot development is curiously lacking here ? which , coupled with the trademark deliberate pacing of the " Euro-Cult " style , makes for an altogether muddled ( if never less than interesting ) affair . An unexpected touch involves fantasy sequences showing various religious paintings come to life , often as a result of the nuns ' ( typical ) sexual repression . Naturally , we get plenty of nudity and , for violent highlights , anything from numerous beheadings , the castration of a horse ( ! ) , rape , sodomy , cannibalism , boiling oil being poured on a girl's naked body , nipple-slashing , impaling and skinning alive is the order of the day ! One final thing : viewers of the Synapse edition had regretted the lack of a trailer on that disc ; incidentally , a German one has been made available among the extras accompanying the X-Rated Kult R2 DVD of the afore-mentioned THE NUN OF MONZA ?
576429	1399158	79135	6.0	FASCINATION ( Jean Rollin , 1979 )	This is the seventh Rollin film I've watched , after THE IRON ROSE ( 1973 ; still his finest work ) , THE DEMONIACS ( 1974 ; the least among his vintage efforts ) , LIPS OF BLOOD ( 1975 ; another good one ) , THE GRAPES OF DEATH ( 1978 ; not bad ) , THE LIVING DEAD GIRL ( 1982 ; one of his most compelling ) and Fiancée ' OF Dracula ( 2002 ; an unsatisfactory hodgepodge of ideas ) . This unusual ' lesbian vampires ' film ? of which the director made quite a few , though the only other such title I'm familiar with is the above-mentioned ( and slightly superior ) LIPS OF BLOOD ? evokes much of the same atmosphere , not only of Rollin's work but of that of Jess Franco as well . In fact , the scenes depicting a scantily-clad Brigitte Lahaie walking the castle grounds ( albeit armed with a scythe ! ) in search of victims brings to mind Lina Romay in the Spaniard's own ( rather dismal ) FEMALE VAMPIRE ( 1973 ) ! One of Rollin's traits seems to be that of throwing modern-day characters ( in this case a handsome but dumb crook ) into essentially Gothic i . e . uncanny surroundings ( the annual reunion at the château by a bunch of lovely ladies ) . The thief believes their mysterious activities to be of a sexual nature and decides to stick around , despite being warned by the two girls who came to the venue beforehand in preparation for the ' ceremony ' that the only other male likely to appear is none other than Satan himself ! Having the jaded aristocracy of another era indulge in odd rites ( such as drinking ox's blood to treat anaemia ! ) is an intriguing notion ? a group of depraved female members , then , decide to take the cure one step further and periodically resort to the intake of human blood ( the revelation isn't all that surprising , but nicely handled just the same ) . An ' unexpected ' development results when it's time to do in with the young man ( his criminal associates , who were actually pursuing him after he ran away with the stash of gold , had already been swiftly dealt with by Lahaie's scythe ) . Though the latter had already been sexually involved with him , her companion believes she has fallen in love and , when the leader of the ' vampires ' dispatches Lahaie to eliminate the thief , the other girl shoots her instead ! Lahaie stumbles outside to the passageway and , with the spilling of the girl's own blood drawing her ' anaemic ' cohorts , they feast on her indiscriminately ! The thief pleads with his savior to flee the cursed place together ? but , on relating to him their back-story , she realizes that the ' call of blood ' is too strong for her to ignore ? Inevitably , the film has all the trademarks of Rollin's style ( and , by extension , the whole " Euro-Cult " vibe ) : lethargic pace , an effective score and ? it goes without saying ? plenty of naked women ( even if , save for Lahaie's unmistakable looks , most prove interchangeable due to the film's essential dearth of characterization ! ) . All of this ensures a haunting and often beautiful piece of work though , not necessarily , a fulfilling { sic } one ; by the way , the DivX copy I acquired ( which also regrettably displayed brief instances of pixellation ) bafflingly omitted any form of credits either at the start or the conclusion ? not even the film's very title is anywhere to be seen ?
577751	1399158	60218	6.0	CAST A GIANT SHADOW ( Melville Shavelson , 1966 )	Earnest , well-mounted but essentially dreary epic about the real-life involvement of an American Jew in the post-war struggle for Israel's independence ? thus sharing its theme with EXODUS ( 1960 ) , and clearly aiming ( but failing ) for a " Marcus Of Israel " feel ! Kirk Douglas stars as Mickey Marcus ? perhaps chosen due to the character's similarities to another historical figure forced by circumstances into leadership , Spartacus , whom Douglas had portrayed in 1960 . He's supported by an eclectic cast which includes Angie Dickinson as his neglected ( ! ) wife , Senta Berger as the Israeli girl he falls for , Topol as an ill-tempered Arab sheik , Luther Adler as a local politician , a plethora of reliable British character actors ? and even guest appearances by Frank Sinatra ( which doesn't amount to much ) , a glum Yul Brynner as a fellow freedom fighter , and John Wayne as a U . S . General whom Douglas initially falls foul of but the two eventually end up respecting one another ( still , seeing Wayne at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp is about as incongruous as his stint playing the Roman Centurion at Christ's crucifixion in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD [ 1965 ] ! ) . Despite a sharp script and good individual sequences , the film is compromised by its necessity to be both a spectacle and a message picture ( the WWII flashbacks , for instance , are unnecessary and merely render the film overlong ) ; unsurprisingly , it works best during the action highlights ( complemented by a typically fine Elmer Bernstein score ) . Apparently , the events have been partially fictionalized ? I wonder whether these embellishments concerned the romantic complications and the Hollywood-style ironic ending . For the record , Shavelson had started out as a scriptwriter ( and later director ) of Bob Hope and Danny Kaye vehicles ; this was his most serious effort ? a brave try , but not quite the ' giant ' film he clearly intended . . .
576252	1399158	67256	6.0	L'Istruttoria E ' Chiusa : Dimentichi ( Tante Sbarre ) ( Damiano Damiani , 1971 )	This poliziottesco of sorts isn't quite what I was expecting as lead Franco Nero's plight is only one of several events tackled in the film . The star is ideally cast as a wronged prisoner ; however , Riccardo Cucciolla's paranoid character grows in importance in the film's second half . The initial stages are actually akin to bizarre black comedy ( detailing all the various eccentric antics of the inmates ) , which doesn't quite jell with the more serious tone later on ; John Steiner ( as a despicable lifer ) and Georges Wilson ( as a dying old-timer ) make a particular impression during this first part . The film - whose translated title , " The Case Is Closed : Forget It " , is no better than that of the novel " Many Bars " on which it's based - depicts everybody as corrupt and reprehensible , with even Nero's everyman hero succumbing in the end ( indulging in clandestine sexual encounters with a female inmate and keeping silent over Cucciolla's harrowing murder ) ! Though the score is by Ennio Morricone , it's nothing like the iconic work by the maestro we all know and love - consisting solely of sound effects ( in fact , I had first heard of the film by way of a CD featuring some of his oddest soundtracks ) ! This was Nero's third of four films he made with director Damiani , all in the same vein ; two of them , which I hadn't watched before either , followed this viewing ( I had caught up with HOW TO KILL A JUDGE [ 1974 ] , recently released on R1 DVD by Blue Underground and perhaps the most satisfactory of them , a couple of years ago ) .
577925	1399158	67367	6.0	LUST FOR A VAMPIRE ( Jimmy Sangster , 1971 )	Like THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN ( 1970 ) , this is one of the most reviled Hammer efforts - but , again , I found it not that bad after all ! Still , being one of the countless vampire-themed outings from the studio , it does feel like a tired rehash of better films ; actually , it happens to be the middle part of Hammer's " Karnstein Trilogy " ( inspired by J . Sheridan Le Fanu's classic short story " Carmilla " ) - if , admittedly , the least of them . As was the case with THE VAMPIRE LOVERS ( 1970 ) and would be again with TWINS OF EVIL ( 1971 ) , the main behind-the-scenes credits weren't the usual Hammer stalwarts : producers Harry Fine and Michael Style , screenwriter Tudor Gates and composer Harry Robinson . While the latter's score is appropriately grandiose for the most part , the love song - apparently inserted without director Sangster's consent , or even knowledge - is a total embarrassment ! It starts off well enough : all-too-typical material , to be sure , but very atmospheric ( Carmilla's reincarnation , for instance , or the scene where hero Michael Johnson is surprised at the dilapidated Karnstein Castle by three cloaked female figures he takes to be vampires ) and reasonably entertaining for all that . Other effective moments include : Carmilla's botched seduction of the Suzanna Leigh character ; a couple of falls down a well , rendered stylized by the use of slow-motion ; and the climax with the vampires trapped inside their flaming castle ( lit by the inevitable torch-bearing villagers ) . However , following the demise half-way through of top-billed Ralph Bates ( yet another impressive turn from Hammer's candidate to replace Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee ) , the film slowly falls apart ; reportedly , Cushing was supposed to have played the scholar / would-be vampire disciple - but I can't help feeling he'd have been both too old and ill-suited for the role . Similarly , Sangster replaced Terence Fisher : it would have been interesting to see Hammer's top director tackle " Carmilla " - but I wonder how he'd have handled the erotic aspects of the story . With its full-frontal nudity and scenes of lesbian love-making , THE VAMPIRE LOVERS had been credited with pushing the boundaries of permissiveness in Hammer horror - and this certainly follows in that tradition , with the script coming up with every possible excuse to have its scrumptious female cast disrobe ! The film does suffer from the lack of a star cast or even those familiar Hammer faces ( other than Bates , that is ) : there's no denying that leading lady Yutte Stensgaard looks great throughout but , ultimately , she makes for an inadequate vampire ( since she's depicted as being more pathetic than evil ) ; Suzanna Leigh , then , is an equally attractive heroine ; Barbara Jefford and Mike Raven , however , don't exactly ignite the screen as the Karnstein descendants ( he was an especially poor choice and Hammer apparently realized this , to the extent that they had his voice dubbed by Valentine Dyall - while close-ups of Christopher Lee's eyes were roped in to ' aid ' his character display the requisite fierceness ! ) ; Helen Christie is unintentionally funny as the headmistress of the school ( where a good deal of the action takes place ) , who breaks down at ill-fated Police Inspector Harvey Hall's interrogation after a girl goes missing - which she fails to report immediately so as not to damage the school's reputation ! In the Audio Commentary , Sangster explains how he was dismissed by the producers ( with whom he never saw eye to eye ) during the editing stage . Suzanna Leigh spends more time discussing her career ( in particular the actress ' brief stint in Hollywood ) than her contribution to the film proper , also mentioning her role in an episode of Hammer's JOURNEY TO THE UNKNOWN ( 1968-9 ) TV series - that , incidentally , was entirely filmed in Malta - and , at one point , even describes an out-of-body experience she went through in the mid-70s ! However , Leigh does recall the atmosphere on the set of LUST FOR A VAMPIRE as being somewhat tense - with the troupe divided into two camps ( one of which was snobbish about the profession , while the other kept a good-humored attitude towards the whole thing ) . Curiously , no mention is made at all of the film's literary origins - or , for that matter , the fact that it formed part of Hammer's Karnstein trilogy !
576819	1399158	67341	6.0	LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH ( John Hancock , 1971 )	For all its cult reputation ( especially given the loud decrying by fans over the film's unavailability on DVD - until recently , that is ) , this initial viewing proved somewhat underwhelming . Being a studio product ( courtesy of Paramount ) , it did receive some exposure on original release : for instance it's listed in " Halliwell's Film Guide " , which usually skimps over such non-mainstream fare ! Still , some of its independently-made low-budget contemporaries - which I came across thanks largely to the Internet - were more immediately impressive ( BONE [ 1972 ] , DEATHDREAM [ 1972 ] , GANJA & HESS [ 1973 ] , DEAD AND BURIED [ 1981 ] ) . For starters , the unknown performers fail to bring conviction to ( or elicit much sympathy for ) the rather dully-written characters . Besides , the film can't quite make up its mind what it wants to be - ghost story , psychological study , or an exercise in low-grade artiness a ' la the contemporaneous work of Jean Rollin ! That said , despite its overly-familiar depiction of a hostile backwoods townsfolk , the eerie lakeside atmosphere ( coupled with an evocative score ) is undeniably effective - resulting in the occasional well-timed frisson ; if anything , the tense latter stages ( with their enigmatic revelation and inconclusive ending ) improve on a slow-moving and somewhat uncertain beginning . Furthermore , the film's clever device of concluding with a repetition of ( actually , a lead-up to ) the opening sequence - that is , without alerting the audience to its essential flashback structure - is also note-worthy and has been imitated in such recent supernatural thrillers as FALLEN ( 1998 ) .
576965	1399158	75114	6.0	STRANGE OCCASION ( Nanni Loy { uncredited } , Luigi Magni and Luigi Comencini , 1976 )	This is another of the myriad Italian compendium films , highlighting some of their more popular stars and dealing with one of the most commercial of subject matters – sex . The first episode with Paolo Villaggio was the centre of controversy over its tastelessness , resulting in director Loy removing his name from it . The star resides in Amsterdam with his wife , making very little money selling specialty Italian food ; one day he crosses paths with a local bigwig who notices the generous size of his member and , soon , Villaggio starts bringing home lots of dough – appearing in mask and costume , billed as the " Italian Superman " , in live porn shows making love to nubile girls stretched out on a large plate of pasta ! It’s not long , however , before the wife finds out – but , rather than ask him to stop , she wants to get in on the act ; the catch is that he can’t ‘work’ with his wife , and this soon leads him to be replaced by a Turkish hunk ! Perhaps the best moment in this episode sees Villaggio hanging over the side of a ship : on chasing his initially distraught wife , he tries to explain that he’s doing it for her as well as the country’s honor , before nonchalantly confessing that he has just s his pants ! Nino Manfredi’s episode may be the most ordinary of the lot , since it’s not much different from many another Italian comedy of the era where an ageing man has one last fling with a teenage acquaintance . However , the star’s wonderful performance – not to mention the lovely presence of the entire female cast ( including Manfredi’s elegant wife and their spunky daughter ) – make it a very engaging romp ( while also commenting on the state of ‘modern’ families ) . The final episode is universally considered the best of the three : it revolves around a very simple situation , where Monsignor Alberto Sordi is trapped in an elevator for three days with sexy young Stefania Sandrelli . They start off by loathing one another , but their predicament ( which happens during Italy’s Ferragosto period , where literally everybody goes on vacation ! ) soon has them bonding . The girl is even lulled into confiding her deepest secrets to the elderly man of the cloth , i . e . how she chose to console a young boy she just met whose mother had recently died ( though when Sandrelli tells the priest that she wasn’t comfortable doing it , due to the presence of the boy’s sister at the same party , he bursts out with a spontaneous " What the f ? " ) . Sordi , however , is eventually revealed to be less pious than he lets on – and his declaration that someone freeing his natural instincts under abnormal conditions ( as happens to him in the dark with Sandrelli here ) isn’t responsible for them is rather a moot point ! With respect to the erotic content in the film , there’s full-frontal nudity only in the first episode , while it’s pretty mild in the second and – understandably – non-existent in the third ; still , one has to admire such respected stars as Manfredi and Sordi for not being afraid to play characters which , basically , could only be labeled ‘dirty old men’ ! Typically , the film is accompanied by a lively lounge score from the late Piero Piccioni . Incidentally , I recently taped a similarly-themed compendium ( starring and directed by Sordi ) called A COMMON SENSE OF MODESTY ( 1976 ) , which I hope to watch one of these days . . .
577763	1399158	595622	6.0	Hammer House Of Horror : The Thirteenth Reunion ( Peter Sasdy , 1980 ) ( TV )	The second episode in the series is directed by a veteran ( albeit a latter-day recruit ) of Hammer Films . Again , while hardly outstanding , this is a more than adequate effort ? even if , for the most part , the narrative follows a mystery-thriller pattern rather than outright horror . Then again , the studio has had its fair share of films in this style and , in any case , the final revelation is horrific ( if not exactly unpredictable ) ? truth be told , it's more ' shocking ' than most of their now rather quaint films ! The casting is modest but nonetheless effective : Julia Foster overacts somewhat ( particularly when supposed to show bewilderment ) as the reporter heroine covering the goings-on at a newly-established diet clinic , Dinah Sheridan ( best-known for her role in GENEVIEVE [ 1953 ] ) is her newspaper editor , Gerard Kelly the young funeral attendant who alerts Foster to his employers ' extra-curricular activities ( which she discovers have a connection with the clinic ) , and Warren Clarke ( Dim from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE [ 1971 ] ) gets a nice role as an ill-fated patient who befriends Foster but ends up getting the wrong sort of raw deal !
576985	1399158	67491	6.0	NIGHT OF DARK SHADOWS ( Dan Curtis , 1971 )	Well , this was nowhere near as bad as the Leonard Maltin Film Guide claimed ? where it's been unenviably slapped with a BOMB rating ! Nonetheless , I was confused by the fact that , while the events once again take place in the Collinswood manor , there's no mention at all of vampirism ? in fact , the ' villain ' of the piece is a witch who , like Barnabas Collins from HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS ( 1970 ) , is intent on kindling an unnatural romance with the lookalike descendant of her former lover ( in this case , young painter David Selby ) . Even more baffling is the fact that several actors return from the first film but as totally different characters ( for instance , Grayson Hall is now the enigmatic housekeeper devoted to her former mistress in the best Mrs . Danvers tradition , while Thayer David merely appears in a flashback as the witch's nemesis ! ) ? still , we get here a similar unhinged acolyte played by a different actor who , however , serves no discernible function this time around ! In any case , the hero arrives with a wife ( future Charlie's Angel Kate Jackson ) in tow ? incidentally , his progenitor had also been married to another woman , and the witch was actually his own brother's spouse ! ; Selby , initially mystified by intermittent visions from the past , eventually falls under the witch's spell and retreats to the tower to paint ? barring entry to his wife , whom he begins to neglect and mistreat ( culminating in a murder attempt ! ) . Though hardly original , the plot is more complex ( and , in a way , intriguing ) than that of the previous film ? approximating , in fact , the classic Gothic / romantic melodrama in the tradition of " Jane Eyre " and , as already intimated earlier on , " Rebecca " . The film , therefore , is much more of a mood-piece than its predecessor with the various nightmares , apparitions and other strange occurrences throughout giving the whole an agreeably uncanny , even surreal vibe ; tying in with this , Robert Cobert's evocative score seems even better suited to the tone of this particular film than that of the more genre-specific HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS . That said , the end result ( at least , judging by the 94-minute Theatrical Release Version under review ? since the ' lost ' Director's Cut was , reportedly , a hefty 129 minutes long ! ) emerges to be vaguely unsatisfactory ( not helped by the less-than-stellar quality of the source , bearing fuzzy credits and a distracting echoey soundtrack ) : for one thing , the ' established ' actors were generally better served by their roles in the first film ? while the new recruits don't exactly set the screen on fire ! The script does take care to provide one final twist leading to a downbeat ' curtain ' ( of the type we have relentlessly suffered from in recent years ? note my comments to the recently-viewed HATCHET [ 2006 ] ) ? though its coda of a newspaper report describing the mysterious road accident in which the central couple's married friends were killed ( but which is then interrupted half-way through ) proves a genuine " What The F ? ! " moment . The film was immediately followed by two distinct theatrical trailers for it , as well as an alternate one for HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS than what was included on its own edition .
577565	1399158	75221	6.0	GOOD NIGHT , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ( Luigi Comencini , Nanni Loy , Luigi Magni , Mario Monicelli and Ettore Scola , 1976 )	This was the second of three films I watched in tribute to Luigi Comencini's passing , which happened over the Easter period . It's one of a myriad of portmanteaus to emerge from Italy over the years : usually , these came in the form of a number of sketches on a particular subject ; this one , emanating from the mid-70s - a time of political strife in the country where kidnappings and assassinations were commonplace - it couldn't help being a scathing satire on religion , politics , the legal system and TV . In fact , so single-minded was the concept that a group of top directors and writers received credit for all the various episodes as a sort of co-operative ! For this purpose , some of Italy's finest actors were summoned - Vittorio Gassman , Marcello Mastroianni , Nino Manfredi , Ugo Tognazzi and new comic star Paolo Villaggio . However , as can be expected , the end result is variable - being generally heavy-handed but occasionally inspired . Mastroianni appears in the linking sequence as a flustered TV newscaster ; Gassman's two episodes are rather weak ; Tognazzi also appears in a couple of segments , but is at his best in the one with scatological overtones - where a military hero loses his dignity along with his decorations and most of his clothing prior to a parade and , unable to face up to this humiliation , opts to take his own life ; the same applies for Villaggio's contribution : two episodes , but the one involving the " Disastrometer " quiz show - where the most wretched of three contestants will eventually emerge victorious - proves to be superior ; Manfredi is featured in just one segment , but it's the longest and possibly best one overall - revolving around a battle for the Papacy which descends to base intrigues and , eventually , mass murder ( also proving somewhat prophetic , given Pope John Paul I's mysterious death in 1978 after just 33 days in office ! ) . Two other amusing episodes involve the chaos brought on by a presumed bomb ( with its ironic denouement ) and a critique on outdated court laws - in which an assembly of senile members deliver unintelligible speeches and engage in a dance to an operatic aria ( the scene recalled a similar episode set in the House Of Lords in THE RULING CLASS [ 1971 ] ) . Among the supporting cast are the likes of Adolfo Celi , Senta Berger , and several regulars from Villaggio's popular and long-running " Fantozzi " series ( then just at its beginning ) . Furthermore , two of Italy's major singer-songwriters , Lucio Dalla and Antonello Venditti , were responsible for the soundtrack of GOOD NIGHT , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN .
577438	1399158	75377	6.0	VAI GORILLA ( Tonino Valerii , 1975 )	Unusual poliziottesco on a topical subject – " Euro-Cult " regular Fabio Testi is an undercover cop doubling as the bodyguard ( hence , " Gorilla " ) of a cantankerous middle-aged industrialist targeted for extortion . Amazingly , to bring the culprits out into the open , he beats the criminals at their own game by purporting to kidnap his own master ( with the aid of his delinquent brother ) ; to complicate matters further , he becomes involved with the industrialist’s own rebellious teenage daughter ( naturally , she falls for him in the blink of an eye ) ! The rest of the ingredients are par for the course within this genre : pulsating score , nonstop action ( notably a heart-pounding scene in which Testi is trapped inside a bottom-less elevator and the FRENCH CONNECTION-inspired chase finale involving a police car and a speeding train – the chief villain’s demise is particularly stunning ) , Testi’s best pal ( Al Lettieri from THE GETAWAY and THE GODFATHER { both 1972 } ) turns out to be corrupt , etc .
576207	1399158	66105	7.0	THE PRICE OF POWER ( Tonino Valerii , 1969 )	I was unfamiliar with this film , until I saw it included in a list of the Top 20 Spaghetti Westerns I recently came across ( following the marathon I made these last few weeks of films from the subgenre ) ; it was auspicious , then , that the film had to turn up almost immediately on late-night Italian TV ( for the first time , I'm pretty sure , in a good number of years ) ! Unfortunately , the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasn't been great lately : I recorded the film on VHS but I decided not to keep it due to this factor ; as it happened , the very next day I watched the film , I found out that it was available on a Region 2 DVD from Italy ( featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi ) - and , having been sufficiently impressed , I decided to order it there and then , even if I knew that I wouldn't be getting to the DVD for quite a while as I like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next ! A brief parenthesis here : when I recently purchased a spate of Spaghetti Westerns on Italian DVD , I opted not to order Sergio Sollima's FACE TO FACE ( 1967 ) , since I was under the impression that it was a bare-bones affair ; however , I've just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director ( as had been the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [ 1966 ] , which I bought ) . It did seem baffling to me that Sollima wouldn't offer similar contribution to that film's DVD edition when he actually considered FACE TO FACE as his favorite work ( as per the director's talent bio included on the Blue Underground Region 1 disc of yet another Sollima Spaghetti Western - RUN , MAN , RUN [ 1968 ] ) ; the trouble is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed it with a viewing of FACE TO FACE via the recording I owned made off Italian TV ! I did order the DVD of that film now - especially since it's still discounted - but as I said with respect to a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER ( although I may still check out Sollima's interview when the disc arrives ) . . . O . K . , rant over : the film under review is quite an unusual Spaghetti Western and a very interesting , indeed ambitious one at that , being a transposition of the JFK assassination case to an Old West setting ! Actually , it's reminiscent of Anthony Mann's terse black-and-white thriller THE TALL TARGET ( 1951 ) - which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of then-U . S . President Abraham Lincoln . It features one of the most popular Italian stars from this subgenre , Giuliano Gemma , in what is perhaps his most impressive Western role ( many of his other films tended to have a light-hearted bent ) . The supporting cast includes at least two other notables : Van Johnson ( in one of his few and mainly unremarkable Italian films ) as the American President killed in post-Civil War Dallas and Fernando Rey as the head of a conspiracy of Southerners - who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting U . S . leader , Johnson's Vice-President , by means of blackmail ! Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who pursues Gemma all through the picture , and with whom he's engaged a couple of times in a ' duel in the dark ' - with the guns resting on the floor rather than in their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys ' cigars ! Also involved is Ray Saunders as Gemma's black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed " Lee Harvey Oswald " figure . Stelvio Massi - who later cut his teeth , as director , on a number of poliziotteschi - is behind the film's luminous cinematography ; similarly , Luis Enrique Bacalov supplies yet another great " Euro-Cult " score - which is different enough from the style of Ennio Morricone as to be equally distinguishable . Valerii's direction here may mot be as imposing as that in other Spaghetti Westerns but he handles the proceedings efficiently enough ( the final gunfight is especially nicely done ) ; the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre and , for those so inclined , the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for . . .
578021	1399158	56406	7.0	REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT ( Ralph Nelson , 1962 )	I had missed out on an Italian TV broadcast of this acclaimed boxing drama in the 80s and , even if it did get released on DVD on both regions , I never got to pick it up until now because its lack of any significant supplements kept pushing it back . Anyway , I got to watch and own it now and it was certainly worth the wait as this must surely rank among the best films that deal with boxing . Interestingly , REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT was originally previewed at a much longer running time ( featuring some 16 minutes of additional footage ) but the version I watched is the more familiar 86-minute cut . The film was superbly written by Rod Serling ? best-known for writing many of THE TWILIGHT ZONE ( 1959-64 ) episodes and introducing the show ? who , among others , provided the screenplay for such notable films as PATTERNS ( 1956 ) , SEVEN DAYS IN MAY ( 1964 ) and PLANET OF THE APES ( 1968 ) . Actually , this was the fourth filming of the play and previous TV versions ? both made in 1957 ? starred Jack Palance and , of all people , Sean Connery in the role played here by Anthony Quinn ! The four leads are all outstanding : Quinn gives what is arguably his most moving performance as the dim-witted boxer who cannot even talk coherently with all the beatings he took in the ring and might even lose his sight if he keeps at it much longer ; Jackie Gleason is excellent as Quinn's manager who is driven to bet against his own man in order to collect some fast dough and pay off his debts to an androgynous racketeer breathing down his neck ; Mickey Rooney is just terrific as Quinn's loyal handler ( and an ex-prizefighter himself ) who quickly sees through all of Gleason's schemes to keep Quinn in the ring for his own personal gain ; and Julie Harris as the lonesome social worker who takes pity on Quinn and tries to get him employed away from ringside perils . The blooming MARTY ( 1955 ) - ish romance between Quinn and Harris is perhaps a bit too good to be true and occurs rather too suddenly for this cynical viewer but it does not in any way detract from the film's stifling recreation of the seamy ambiance ? strikingly similar to that of THE HUSTLER ( 1961 ) , also featuring Jackie Gleason ? aided in no small measure by Arthur J . Ornitz's noir-ish lighting and Laurence Rosenthal's jazzy score , not to mention the appearance of real-life boxing pros such as Cassius Clay ( playing himself as one of Quinn's ringside opponents ) and Jack Dempsey . Ralph Nelson was an erratic director with pretensions : I've watched 8 of his films so far and a few more have been numerous times on TV ? FATHER GOOSE ( 1964 ) , ONCE A THIEF ( 1965 ) , THE WRATH OF GOD ( 1972 ) ? so I guess I should make an extra effort now to catch them the next time they're on ; REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT , while actually his debut film , remains possibly his most satisfying work all round and deservedly earned him a nod from the Directors ' Guild of America .
576337	1399158	61391	7.0	BEDAZZLED ( Stanley Donen , 1967 )	While I consciously had never bothered with the recent remake , I did miss the original a couple of times in the past on Cable TV ; now that I have finally caught up with it , I'd say it's a curious , with-it updating of the Faustian legend for the Swinging Sixties crowd which , in spite of frequently hitting its various targets , is rather patchy overall , thus rendering its cult status slightly overrated . The three leads ? Dudley Moore ( as the timid cook hero ) , Peter Cook ( as Mr . Spiggott alias The Horned One ) and Eleanor Bron ( Moore's co-worker and object of desire ) ? are very appealing , although the film is perhaps best-remembered today for Raquel Welch's steamy , scene-stealing cameo as one of Spiggott's cohorts , Lilian Lust . Moore's various role-plays ? during the granting of his seven wishes ? are quite amusing , especially the accent he adopts during his intellectual mode and his befuddled countenance while impersonating a cuckolded aristocrat ; at one point , he is even turned into a fly on the wall ! The leaping nuns segment is perhaps the most outrageous one of all but it works surprisingly well , as does Peter Cook's deadpan song recital ( during the black-and-white pop idol sequence ) which is an unexpected highlight ; Mr . Spiggott is also seen intermittently creating mischief towards the general public ? releasing a group of wasps onto some nearby peaceful hippies , removing the bottom from under a woman's shopping bag , ripping the last pages off Agatha Christie mysteries , etc . ) The witty screenplay , written by Peter Cook himself , features several in-jokes : " Julie Andrews " is the magic phrase which transports Moore from one misadventure to the next ; Cook at one point makes a reference to director Stanley Donen's own earlier popular musical , SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS ( 1954 ) ; the name of the character played by Dudley Moore is Stanley Moon ? which is how Sir John Gielgud ( who would later famously co-star with Moore in the ARTHUR movies ) had erroneously referred to Moore in a letter praising a stage performance he had seen him in ! Unfortunately , the subplot involving the ongoing investigation of Moore's supposed suicide / disappearance doesn't really work ( despite the welcome presence of investigating officer Michael Bates ) because there would have been no reason for the police to question Bron for so long since she was only a colleague of Moore's ( and one with which he barely exchanged words to boot ) and not his fiancée ! Dudley Moore also composed the music score which , during the opening credits , is great but the rest of the film merely features variations on the same theme . Although by far the most successful , BEDAZZLED was not the first screen teaming of comic duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore ( who originally hailed from TV ) : it was preceded by the all-star THE WRONG BOX ( 1966 ; with which I am familiar ) and was followed by MONTE CARLO OR BUST ( 1969 ) , THE BED-SITTING ROOM ( 1969 ; which I have on DivX but have yet to watch ) and the reportedly disastrous THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES ( 1978 ) . Furthermore , Stanley Donen had previously tackled the Faust theme as a Hollywood musical , DAMN YANKEES ( 1958 ) ; having shot the Hitchcock pastiche ARABESQUE ( 1966 ) in England , Donen stayed on the Continent for three more films : the marital comedy-drama TWO FOR THE ROAD ( 1967 ; starring Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn ) , BEDAZZLED , and his misguided depiction of the gay lifestyle , STAIRCASE ( 1969 ; starring Richard Burton and Rex Harrison ) .
577958	1399158	455590	7.0	THE LAST KING OF Scotland ( Kevin MacDonald , 2006 )	Forest Whitaker deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his vivid portrayal of Ugandan dictator , General Idi Amin ( even though newsreel footage at the end shows there is not that much of a facial resemblance ) , who starts out as being fairly benign but gradually turns to mass-murdering tyranny through his paranoia and mood swings . Showing the events from the viewpoint of his out-of-his-league Scottish physician was an innovation but , eventually , this drags the film into dreary melodramatics when the doc impregnates one of Amin's wives and , ultimately , serves to render the film unfocused and overlong . The film is certainly very well done and generally compelling but , once one realizes that the Scottish doctor is a fictional character , the viewer is left wondering whether the director ( or the author of the book on which the script was based ) opted to take a foreigner's eye-view of this turbulent period in South African history because otherwise the project would have had no commercial momentum ! Not much barbarity is shown but , when it is , the results are quite chilling - such as the vivisected body of Amin's duplicitous wife and his hideous torture of the doctor practically in full view of the Entebbe hostages , scenes which wouldn't have been amiss in a horror film !
576349	1399158	87755	7.0	The Muppets Take Manhattan ( Frank Oz , 1984 )	The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing , with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright ( yet volatile ) lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism . Of course , their first attempt fails and Kermit ( leader of the group and author of the show ) blows his top ; so , the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them . Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner ( the old man , then , has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs ! ) . We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars : Art Carney ( as a producer ) , James Coco ( as an overzealous dog owner ) , Dabney Coleman ( as a confidence trickster ) , Elliott Gould ( who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [ 1979 ] ) , Gregory Hines , Liza Minnelli ( as herself ? having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit's , sporting fake moustache , as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets ' show ) , Brooke Shields , and even director John Landis ( in possibly the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig ! ) . The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces , with ( regrettably ) less space given to Gonzo this time around ; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me , the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress ? and especially her violent reaction to this ? are undeniably funny . What disappoints , however , is the climactic show itself ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue ) which , rather than the expected splashy routines , procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy !
577078	1399158	451094	7.0	SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE ( Chan-wook Park , 2005 )	This turned out to be even more elaborate than Park's OLDBOY ( 2003 ) but , ultimately , not as good or as involving . For one thing , all the various characters are repellent and there is much irrelevant detail about the leading lady's prison comrades ! As had been the case with OLDBOY , the violence is depicted in an extremely graphic fashion - which one can't quite associate with the director's meek-looking self ( I was lucky to attend a Press Conference he gave , along with fellow directors Takashi Miike and Fruit Chan , for their compendium film THREE . . . EXTREMES during the 2004 Venice Film Festival ) ! Still , the visual style deployed by the director is arresting enough and the film's centerpiece - a lengthy scene revolving around a child murderer's come-uppance at the hands of relatives of his various victims - is appropriately distressing . The film is the concluding segment in a loose trilogy which also comprises OLDBOY and the similarly-titled SYMPATHY FOR MR . VENGEANCE ( 2002 ) . I haven't yet caught up with the latter and , in fact , JSA ( 2000 ) is the only other Park film I've watched . . .
578028	1399158	454848	7.0	INSIDE MAN ( Spike Lee , 2006 )	This is only my third Spike Lee movie ( the others being DO THE RIGHT THING [ 1989 ] and MALCOLM X [ 1992 ] ) , but I'd say that it's his most atypical film to date - a very enjoyable and smartly-written thriller which , thankfully , does not take itself too seriously and besides features a good cast in fine form ( Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster , the latter cast against type , are particularly impressive ) . The throwback half-way through to MARATHON MAN ( 1976 ) territory is unexpected and not totally convincing , however , especially since Clive Owen's real motives are kept from the spectator . There's the occasional caper / police procedural cliché , too , to be sure - but , overall , the film manages to work around them in clever and original ways . Also , while the film deals with Washington's family life from time to time , it's mercifully left in the background and doesn't get in the way of the main plot . Lee's direction is needlessly flashy at times , but one can't really blame him for playing the Hollywood game when given a big budget and a specific genre to work in .
576675	1399158	64612	7.0	MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S ( Eric Rohmer , 1969 )	Certainly among Rohmer's better work due , more than anything else , to his using top actors - as it's actually one of the film-maker's more cerebral efforts ; in fact , its relentless preoccupation with religion and morality makes it pretty heavy-going ( as much , I'd say , as Bunuel's THE MILKY WAY [ 1969 ] ) ! The plot , in itself , is pretty simple but - even in spite of rather murky black-and-white cinematography - it holds one's interest because the three main characters are so well written by Rohmer and enacted by Jean-Louis Trintignant ( such a consummate performer that he could virtually adapt to the style of any director ! ) , Francoise Fabian and Marie-Christine Barrault . Not being a great fan of Rohmer's , I opted to rent this one before deciding whether or not to buy Criterion's upcoming Box Set of his " Six Moral Tales " ( of which this is the third ) - even though I had previously watched LA COLLECTIONNEUSE ( 1971 ; actually shot in ' 67 ) , which didn't impress me , and CLAIRE'S KNEE ( 1970 ) , which I recall being quite good . . .
576464	1399158	470705	7.0	BUG ( William Friedkin , 2006 )	I have to agree with Michael Elliott that this is one strange movie ! Admirably for a modern film , the director refrains from the temptation to open-up the narrative ( it's mostly set inside a single motel room ! ) . Despite Friedkin's typically probing camera , the emphasis is on the dialogue and the acting : the former is perceptive if not especially compelling during the first half ; again , the latter starts off as variable but becomes intense as the situation between the two protagonists spirals into paranoid hysterics . Ironically , just as the unrelated 1975 film BUG ( which I've just watched ) starts out one way and then goes off the rails into completely unexpected territory , the same is very much true in this case : while the initial romantic character drama ( which sees independent woman Ashley Judd torn between aggressive boyfriend Harry Connick Jr . and sweet-but-enigmatic acquaintance Michael Shannon ) provides its own tension , nothing could have prepared one for the psychological / conspiracy theory thriller it slowly evolves into ? with that amazing tinfoil-wrapped set and the bleakest of endings !
576729	1399158	155796	7.0	DR . AKAGI ( Shohei Imamura , 1998 )	Interesting if typically overlong multi-character drama with a wartime setting , about the exploits of an ageing and old-fashioned doctor ( whose diagnosis for all his patients is always the same : hepatitis ! ) in a fishing community . Several enjoyable vignettes along the way : the young prostitute who becomes the doctor's aide but continues in her clandestine profession against his better judgment ; the doctor's appearance at a Tokyo medical conference , in which he is moved to tears by the reception given him by the more illustrious colleagues present ; the girl hiding an injured soldier who has escaped from a P . O . W . camp , involving the doctor and several other people from the village ( who are later tortured by the authorities ) ; the girl hunting a blue whale , in emulation of her legendary fisherman father , at the film's surprising and strangely beautiful climax - after which she and the doctor witness the historic blast of the atom bomb ( which , to the latter appears in the form of an enlarged liver , a common trait of the dreaded hepatitis ! ) .
578001	1399158	64754	7.0	OH ! WHAT A LOVELY WAR ( Richard Attenborough , 1969 )	Attenborough's directing debut is patchy but impressive ( even garnering a Directors Guild Award nod ) , immediately demonstrating his affinity for grandiose subjects ; however , it was brave of him to go against the typically romantic view of British Imperialism ( not that it was an isolated case during this time - witness the comparable military caricatures depicted in Tony Richardson's THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE [ 1968 ] or , for that matter , Lindsay Anderson's irreverent expose ' of the education system in IF . . . [ 1968 ] ) . The all-star cast assembled for the film looks extraordinary on paper but , actually , only a few of them are given substantial roles - Dirk Bogarde's contribution is especially insignificant if still amusing . I was under the impression that the musical numbers featured in the film were written for the stage show which inspired it : interestingly , they're really a collection of songs that were popular around the time of World War I - notably sarcastic ditties ' improvised ' by the soldiers to take their minds off the grueling experiences on the battlefields ; best of all , perhaps , is a sequence in which a popular hymn is sung simultaneously by a church gathering and an army troop ( with the latter replacing the verses altogether to give it their typically cynical and anarchic perspective ! ) . Production values are top-notch but the overall structure , though generally admirably transferred to the screen , remains somewhat disjointed - the film coming across too often as a series of revue sketches which alternate between the cheerfully jingoistic ( Maggie Smith's stirring recruiting song ) , the broadly comic ( as in the scenes involving John Mills ' fanatical yet foolhardy Commander ) and the immensely poignant ( the wonderful sequence in which hostilities mutually cease over Christmas and the soldiers of both sides decide to meet in No Man's Land in order to share drinks and each other's company , not to mention the famous closing tracking shot over the endless graveyard ) , or else serve merely as expository passages ( as in the recurring stylized pier scenes where the leaders of the various countries - among them Ralph Richardson , John Gielgud , Jack Hawkins and Ian Holm - are seen converging to examine the progress of the war ) .
577286	1399158	435625	7.0	The Descent ( 2005 )	Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS ( 2002 ) with this nail-biting sleeper . After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE ( 1972 ) mode , the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise . The all-female cast members are relative newcomers , a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements , the supernatural and , at times , themselves . It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the " Crawlers " ( with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up ) for as long as he does ; if I were to nitpick , I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different ' voice ' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC ( 1997 ) . The surprise , downbeat , open-ended ' twist ' ending , then , is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before .
577049	1399158	92067	7.0	LAPUTA - CASTLE IN THE SKY ( Hayao Miyazaki , 1986 )	As I was about to write this , I decided to re-read my review of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE ( 2004 ) - which I watched earlier this year - and I realized that what I had said about that film pretty much applies to this one as well , even if there's practically a 20-year gap between them ( I guess the inference here is that this celebrated animator's style hasn't developed all that much in the interim , which is not necessarily a bad thing ) . To quote myself , then : " a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius ; however , it also features his typical faults - to me , at least - of presenting an over-ambitious ( and overly weird ) plot line which , due to its excessive length , tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming ( if not necessarily memorable ) visual experience ! As usual , the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive " . Granted , the plot of LAPUTA isn't nearly as involved as some of Miyazaki's later work , though this is still far from a kiddie film - particularly in its climactic set-piece , where all parties concerned ( the children , the sky pirates - whose hard exterior mellows gradually to reveal an essential softness underneath - and the army - whose leader , too , isn't what he seems to be ) converge on the titular flying citadel , each having their own goal . It's evident , therefore , that characterization is not at all one-dimensional ( though Miyazaki dispenses with anthropomorphism this time around ) - while the robotic guardians of the island castle are strikingly designed , as well as suitably imposing ; the score ( by frequent Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi ) , too , emerges as a definite asset . To tie in with how I began this review , then , I believe that it's been my over-exposure to Anime on Italian TV as a kid which has diluted the overall impact that such feature-length efforts ( and Miyazaki's films in particular ) seem to have - pretty much unanimously - on audiences from other parts of the world . . .
577283	1399158	65916	7.0	JOE ( John G . Avildsen , 1970 )	A fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural / political aura of the late 60s ( taking in the class struggle as well ) which , ironically , in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views , makes full use of the permissiveness that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize ! Norman Wexler's incisive Oscar-nominated script is superbly enacted by Peter Boyle ( in a powerhouse performance ) who manages to make his garrulous , down-to-earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character ( with a barely-disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion ) likable , even admirable ; indeed , he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young Marlon Brando ! Similar to other generation gap movies of its era like TAKING OFF ( 1971 ) and HARDCORE ( 1978 ) but also nihilistic vigilante films like DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) and TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) - interestingly enough , two of these also feature Boyle - JOE ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm . . .
577538	1399158	66040	7.0	Don't Deliver Us from Evil ( Joel Seria , 1971 )	I recently made a binge of DVD purchases , and among these were 6 Mondo Macabro releases I had been eyeing for some time . This is the first one I checked out , and it's a stunner - for several reasons ! I had never heard of the film before its DVD announcement - but now I feel that it's been seriously neglected and , hopefully , Mondo Macabro's wonderful " Special Edition " can give this title a new lease of life . Inspired by the same events which were eventually treated directly in Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES ( 1994 ) , the film is a perverse little item with rampant anti-Catholicism at its fore and which , unsurprisingly , was banned when it emerged ; with this in mind , I love the way Mondo Macabro ended their description of it on the back cover : " It's a film that should be viewed only by those with very open minds " ! Concerning two teenage girls ' rebellion against their repressed upbringing by making a Satanic pact , in which they dedicate their lives to committing evil , it reminded me of other notorious " Chick Flicks " from the same era such as ALUCARDA ( 1975 ) and TO BE TWENTY ( 1978 ) . The film doesn't have much of a plot and is deliberately paced , but it's held firmly together by the deliciously malevolent performances of the two leads ( and particularly the untrained Jeanne Goupil , from whose viewpoint the events are related , and who subsequently hitched up with first-time director and former actor Seria ! ) . It seems to me that the reason the film is so obscure is that , when new , it was ahead of its time but , even now , it would be almost impossible to make ( despite the ostensibly graphic nature of French cinema today ) - featuring any number of shocking and potentially offensive images , which I won't spoil here for the uninitiated ! Still , I have to mention the disturbing double rape inflicted - or , rather , invited - upon Catherine Wagener ( though playing under-aged , the actress was actually 19 at the time ) and the incredible finale , set inside a crowded school auditorium , which is sparked { sic } by the two girls ' recital on stage of a strange poem by Baudelaire . The simple yet haunting music - performed on the organ or as a cantata - is highly effective , and the DVD extras ( featuring , among others , separate interviews with Seria and Goupil ) complement the film very nicely indeed .
577527	1399158	25965	7.0	WE’RE NOT DRESSING ( Norman Taurog , 1934 )	I can’t say that I was particularly looking forward to this musical comedy , but it turned out to be a very entertaining 1 hour and 14 minutes . Being a Bing Crosby vehicle ( albeit featured on Universal’s Carole Lombard set ) , there’s a plethora of dated romantic songs – and since a young ( not to say slim ) Ethel Merman appears in support , she chimes in as well . . . and so does comic Leon Errol ! Still , as I said , it’s a generally fun seafaring ride ( inspired by J . M . Barrie’s " The Admirable Crichton " ) – though given a rather silly and entirely meaningless title ! Also in the cast are another comic couple – George Burns ( who really achieved stardom after an Oscar-winning turn some 40 years later ! ) and real-life spouse Gracie Allen – and a young ( though somewhat stiff ) Ray Milland as one of two aristocratic parasites hoping to win Lombard’s hand . However , she’s got her eyes on crooning sailor Crosby – but , of course , their relationship runs far from smoothly ! Starting off on Lombard’s yacht , the group are shipwrecked on a tropical island ( thanks to a tipsy Errol sabotaging the boat’s commands ) – where explorers Burns and Allen ( ! ) are carrying out some kind of research . Actually , the two parties rarely interact : in fact , very little happens on the island itself – other than that the feckless idle rich are taught a moral lesson by the manly and resourceful Crosby ( anticipating Lombard’s own MY MAN GODFREY [ 1936 ] in this respect ) . It’s refreshing to find Lombard in a non-wacky role , but her performance is just as delightful as ever ; equally notable are the amusing contribution of Errol ( Lombard’s uncle but who’s sympathetic to commoner Crosby ) and the various antics of the harebrained Allen ( which includes her devising an unlikely and complicated method to trap wild animals ) . Even so , an amiable bear named Droopy ( Lombard’s pet ! ) steals everybody’s thunder – especially in the way it cuddles up to Crosby when singing a particular tune , and a hilarious scene in which the animal runs riot on the deck of the yacht after Errol fits it with skating shoes ! There’s even a joke at the expense of another Paramount star , Mae West , when a sailor describes the acronym ‘B . C . �� as ‘Before " Come Up And See Me , Sometime " ’ .
576684	1399158	60271	7.0	THE GAME IS OVER ( Roger Vadim , 1966 )	From what little I've watched of Vadim's work , this is his most consistently satisfying effort ( though the best overall film would still be his famous horror compendium SPIRITS OF THE DEAD [ 1968 ] , co-directed with Federico Fellini and Louis Malle ) . Based on a novel by Emile Zola ( curiously enough , the very next day I watched THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA [ 1937 ] , a superb Hollywood biopic ! ) , the film deals with a bourgeois family disrupted when the ageing patriarch's second and much younger bride falls for her husband's son from his earlier marriage ( who is her peer ) ; while the script isn't especially deep , the film is absorbing all the way . Impeccably shot by Claude Renoir , its garish style is very typical of 60s European Art-house cinema and the sitar-tinged score even gives it a psychedelic vibe ! The three main roles - Jane Fonda ( married to Vadim at the time and therefore still in her " sex kitten " days ) , Peter McEnery ( a surprising choice but a good one ) and Michel Piccoli ( effortlessly hypnotic , he's simply one of the finest - if largely unsung - actors of his generation ) - are splendidly filled . The ending is somewhat abrupt and unresolved but , again , it's totally in keeping with the times in which it was made !
577946	1399158	40185	7.0	THE BOY WITH GREEN HAIR ( Joseph Losey , 1948 )	Losey's first feature film was this unexpected Technicolor fantasy with a strong anti-war message . Dean Stockwell is a boy whose parents are busy doing war duty during the London blitz ; after they're killed , he's taken in by cheerful Irish former actor Pat O'Brien ( who bursts into song at the drop of a hat ) ? in perhaps the least typical scene in the director's entire oeuvre ( more suited to an MGM musical , in fact ! ) , he recalls his private performance before a European king ! Anyway , things take a curious turn when , in direct opposition to children's suffering in wartime , Stockwell's hair goes from black to green ( the color of Spring and , therefore , hope ) overnight . However , this defiant gesture isn't easily understood by either the boy's peers ( who take to bullying him ) or the local elders ( who treat him as an outcast ) ; amusingly , milk-man Regis Toomey drops his consignment of bottles off-camera when the physical change which has occurred in Stockwell finally dawns on him ! Medical science can't help the boy either , but a ' visit ' by other war orphans reassures him of the symbolic role he has to play . Even so , as with virtually every harbinger of an inconvenient truth , he still ends up victimized : his head is completely shaved and , running away , comes across sympathetic children's doctor Robert Ryan ( ! ) ? to whom the story thus far is recounted in flashback . Given the vital importance of color here , this emerges a very pleasant-looking film indeed ; the ensuing drama is remarkably well handled with , thankfully , little concession to sentimentality . Though there's regrettably too little of Ryan to counterbalance O'Brien's malarkey , the whole is undoubtedly boosted by the haunting tune " Nature Boy " ( which would somehow find its way effectively into the eclectic MOULIN ROUGE [ 2001 ] score ! ) .
576477	1399158	71424	7.0	DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY ( John Hough , 1974 )	I hadn’t intended to watch this just now but a couple of coincidences made it inevitable – once again , Vic Morrow has a featured role ( it’s chilling how the actor feared that , having to spend about half the running-time inside a chopper in this case , would be the end of him ! ) and it re-united director Hough and co-star Susan George from EYEWITNESS ( 1970 ) . This is among the most popular road movies from an era full of such efforts , complete with a memorable title and matching theme tune ; Peter Fonda and Adam Roarke , both of whom had flourished in biker movies during the late 1960s , here exchange their typical vehicle for a racing car . In this respect , it resembles most closely VANISHING POINT ( 1971 ) – as per one of the trailers on the Anchor Bay SE DVD , the two were even re-issued as a double-bill ! – though largely eschewing that film’s philosophical overtones . As can be expected , it’s generally fast-paced , tyre-screeching and stunt-heavy fun ; the film ( Englishman Hough’s first in the U . S . and which manages to capture that peculiar mid-American flavor ) , however , provides more than just the obvious kind of thrills . To begin with , the narrative opens with a supermarket caper ( the one scene in which an uncredited Roddy McDowall , fresh from the same director’s scary ghost story THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE [ 1973 ] , appears ) but we also get plenty of confrontation scenes ( and not just between fugitives and law enforcers , but within each individual group ) . This occasions some hilarious dialogue exchanges , such as when George rejects Fonda’s advances – he quips that the night before she had no qualms about it and , in fact , kept begging for more . . . but she retorts that that ought to have clued him in about just how little she was actually getting ! Similarly , veteran cops Morrow and Kenneth Tobey often clash about how to approach the manhunt : at one point , the former argues that the latter’s obsession with apprehending the fugitives is merely a middle-aged man’s grasping to hold on to his job but he’ll only be physically worn-out by the experience ( Morrow , then , believes that Tobey doesn’t want to put all he’s got into the chase simply because he’s been promised a new set of police cars – which , most likely , won’t be forthcoming if he proves overly efficient ! ) . As a matter of fact , one of the reasons the film ( which , according to the accompanying featurette , was partly improvised ) works so well is because each of the principal roles is perfectly cast – thus ensuring that characterization isn’t lost amid all the hair-raising action ; incidentally , the IMDb lists additional footage ( extending a couple of scenes ) that was utilized for the film’s network showings . Among the most notable stunts are : the one in which an impulsive young police officer’s car ( which he has " souped up " – after the original engine overheated – in order to keep up with Fonda et al ) is crushed by a falling telephone pole ; another flies through a billboard ; one more runs off the road backwards and ends up in a stream ; the fugitive’s own ‘classic’ Dodge Charger ( which they exchange midway through the chase ) leaping across a drawbridge ; and , of course , its climactic crash into a speeding train – giving the whole a fashionable , yet appropriately sobering , downbeat ending ( ominously , Morrow’s relentless chopper itself often looms perilously close to its quarry before ultimately running out of gas ! ) . I haven’t listened to Hough’s full-length Audio Commentary , but the half-hour documentary was nonetheless a pretty solid affair which covered most of the bases ; highlights included Fonda’s declaration that he idolized former sci-fi / B-movie hero Tobey ( despite sharing no scenes with him in the actual film ! ) , as well as the star’s surprised admission that DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY out-grossed even his signature effort EASY RIDER ( 1969 ) , not to mention the expected ( albeit brief ) but well-deserved tribute to Morrow – of the three titles I’ve watched with him over the past week or so , his contribution in this one was clearly the most substantial and satisfactory ( definitely proving him worthier of greater attention than merely for his acclaimed debut performance as the disaffected punk in BLACKBOARD JUNGLE [ 1955 ] and his ill-fated swan song ) . Finally , having enjoyed this so much , I was reminded that I’ve probably got scores of other films from the iconoclastic and eclectic 1970s in my collection which I’ve yet to go through . . .
577271	1399158	64013	7.0	That Damned Hot Day Of Fire ( Paolo Bianchini , 1968 )	I'd never heard of this one before its recent late-night Italian TV screening ; on a hunch , I looked the film up on the " Spaghetti Western Database " , where it's given a favorable write-up ? and I'm glad I did , because this is a solid entry within the genre . I also wasn't familiar with director Bianchini ? but , then , the same also held true for Mario Lanfranchi of DEATH SENTENCE ( 1968 ) , another unconventional Spaghetti Western I was impressed by of late . The film is enjoyable , reasonably stylish and displays plenty of invention throughout ; at the same time , we have to contend with some resistible ( albeit brief ) humor . It's also quite a violent offering : the hero is dragged by a horse , tied to a tree and beaten-up en masse , buried alive and shot at a number of times ( the film's single most startling moment ? which I'm amazed wasn't cut for TV ? involves the graphic extraction , in gloating close-up , of a bullet from his hand ! ) . The action scenes are undeniably well-staged ? with the hero always managing to outwit the villains and emerge victorious ( despite being greatly outnumbered ) . Having mentioned all of this , it's interesting that I should be following the film with the newest James Bond adventure ? I may be wrong here , but this Western seems to have been inspired to some extent by that highly popular franchise ( then in its heyday ) : the complex plot ( involving espionage at the time of the American Civil War , having a Gatling gun for the obligatory " McGuffin " , and where one of the characters is revealed to be a ' defector ' ) , dour womanizing hero ( with the leading lady typically picked out from the opposite side and another who's dispatched by the villains for her involvement with him ) , etc . Casting , too , is more than adequate : Robert Woods ( who would feature in a dire Spaghetti Western I'd watched not too long ago , SAVAGE GUNS [ 1971 ] , but also six Jess Franco movies ? including the haunting THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR [ 1973 ] ) , John Ireland ( excellent as an uncouth half-breed bandit who can throw a deadly knife with his toes { ! } and , to feign a tough exterior , lights a match against his bare feet and eats an onion raw ? though there's also an anti-racist angle surprisingly attached to his character ) , Evelyn Stewart , George Rigaud and Gerard Herter . With respect to the soundtrack , apart from an effectively atypical jazzy score by Piero Piccioni , there's a nice atmospheric touch in the constant buzzing of flies ( due to the oppressive heat ) . For the record , the framing on the edition I watched was slightly compromised by being opened up from the original Techniscope ( 2 . 35 : 1 ) to the 1 . 85 : 1 ratio . By the way , an alternate title for the film is GATLING GUN ? another Western by that name was made in 1973 ( and one which is readily available for DVD rental locally ) .
577890	1399158	64045	7.0	THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU ( Basil Dearden , 1969 )	Typical 1960s big-budget all-star entertainment with an unlikely but intriguing backdrop ( the political turmoil in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century ) and agreeably treated as black comedy . As can be surmised , the titular organization ? headed by Oliver Reed and numbering among its members Telly Savalas , Curt Jurgens , Philippe Noiret , Clive Revill and Kenneth Griffith ? disposes of people it deems criminal but which the law apparently can't reach ? until some of them start to get too big for their boots , while Reed accepts lady journalist Diana Rigg's offer of a contract on himself ! Stylish and colorful ( shot on a variety of stunning European locations and with great care given to sets , costumes and props ) , the film is vastly entertaining along the way ? gleefully poking fun at politics and murder at every turn . Reed and Rigg make a very appealing couple , while Savalas , Jurgens et al have fun sending up their respective images ; of course , Rigg and Savalas would be re-teamed that same year for the James Bond outing ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE . The script , therefore , delivers plenty of suspense and surprise ( including numerous disguises and near-escapes for the hero ) and is capped by a spectacular climax in which a bomb attack via zeppelin ? targeting a castle where all the rulers of Europe have convened for a peace conference ? is thwarted .
576101	1399158	51622	7.0	THE FLY ( Kurt Neumann , 1958 )	I had watched this as a kid during an all-night horror marathon on Italian TV ? though I missed out on the sequel , RETURN OF THE FLY ( 1959 ) , which was part of the same program ( and will only now catch up with it all these many years later ! ) . The original may deserve its status as a sci-fi / horror classic but David Cronenberg's ultra-visceral 1986 remake makes it look quaint nowadays and , even at the time , it must have seemed one of the genre's sillier examples ; in fact , one would be hard-pressed to keep a straight face throughout ( particularly during the family's extended search for the ' white-headed ' fly ) . Still , it's clearly well done ( nicely shot in color by genre veteran Karl Struss and boasting an intelligent script by , of all people , James Clavell ! ) ? with an interesting flashback structure that undeniably helps augment the suspense factor , as well as Canadian settings which may not be so unusual for a horror film of its era ( though the strain on the actors having to fake a French accent throughout is apparent ! ) and yet prove to be entirely gratuitous in the long run . The cumbersome laboratory equipment and artless design of the all-important teleporting device date the film somewhat as well . However , the make-up ( of both ' species ' of human fly ) is admirably grotesque and its " look " is withheld from the audience long enough for major effect ? while the plot's latter stages ( detailing the agonized yet completely rational interaction between David Hedison's mutated scientist and devoted wife Patricia Owens ) is genuinely affecting and , really , is what gives the film its raison d'etre ; even so , Hedison gives up rather too easily on finding a cure and his transporting himself fully clothed seems risible today ? this is in direct opposition to the admittedly absorbing but incredibly disgusting ' body horror ' experience of Cronenberg's remake ( though still the superior version of the two all things considered ) . Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall lend distinguished support ? the former as Hedison's brother who's secretly in love with his wife ( a role the horror icon would reprise in the next installment of " The Fly Trilogy " ) , the latter as the elderly and reasonably sympathetic Police Inspector on the case ( Hedison and Owens had together engineered the former's ' release ' from his precarious physical and mental condition , for which she has been charged with murder ) . For the record , I found Paul Sawtell's music score to be too bombastic at times and , tragically , director Kurt Neumann did not enjoy the fruits of his biggest box-office success as he took his own life before THE FLY went into general release ( apparently as a result of his wife's own recent demise ) !
576926	1399158	1099938	7.0	BUNUEL ? ATHEIST THANKS TO GOD ( Julien Gaurichon , 2005 )	This is yet another insightful documentary on the great Surrealist film-maker ; the sub-title is a reference to a typically Bunuelian non-sequitur which has become perhaps his most quoted saying . Of course , the director's preoccupation with both God and godlessness can be felt throughout much of his work ? but it applies most strongly , for obvious reasons , to THE MILKY WAY ( 1969 ) ? his " gleeful put-down of Christian dogma " , to steal from my own review of that film . Unfortunately , my very relative quibbles with it ? being inordinately highbrow and rather obscure ? is curiously replicated in the documentary as well , since the various speakers tend to over-analyze Bunuel's ultimate intent and his own personal approach to religion ( something the director himself would have vehemently disapproved ) ! As a matter of fact , in his position ( being on the outside looking in , so to speak ) , Bunuel seemed to appreciate better than most the mysteries inherent within Christianity . Perhaps the highlight of the documentary is the account by co-scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carriere of a group of gypsies who went to watch the film ( despite being unable to understand either dialogue or subtitles ! ) everyday for a week ; however , when the manager of that particular cinema queried them ( out of sheer curiosity ) as to the reason behind this ' pilgrimage ' ? what coincidence , given the plot of THE MILKY WAY itself ! ? they never came back ! ! As for Bunuel , he blatantly refused to rationalize the incident ? while clearly cherishing its singular nature ? when Carriere told him about it .
577000	1399158	48696	7.0	TARANTULA ( Jack Arnold , 1955 )	This is one of the most fondly remembered of the ' giant monster ' films popularized by THEM ! ( 1954 ) and , in hindsight , still ranks among the best of its type . I had first watched it on late-night Italian TV in my early teens and recall being somewhat let down ; I was more receptive towards the film on a secondary viewing ? since it's clearly a notch above the other titles in the " Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection " set ( save , obviously , for THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN [ 1957 ] ) . Anyway , the film echoes THEM ! ( which is the superior effort , by the way ) in several aspects , but is sufficiently different to stand on its own merits . Actually , it's a logical extension of the earlier film ? because even if we have only one mutant monster here ( not necessarily a budgetary imposition ) , it's an insect species that's far deadlier than the ants seen in THEM ! Besides , even if the resultant growth in size is man-made , it's the product of an experiment involving a genuine concern for mankind's future ( the creation of synthetic food , which would eliminate the problem of famine facing Earth's ever-growing population ) ; the fault , then , lies in man's own impatience at achieving his goal ! An original subtext to the central narrative ? and which , as Leslie Halliwell opined , is perhaps even scarier than the idea of an over-sized spider ? is the fact that the experiment is eventually conducted on human beings , causing acute acromegaly ( shown via amusingly exaggerated make-up ) ! The cast of TARANTULA may not be as prestigious as that of THEM ! , but it's certainly agreeable : regular Universal hero John Agar ( who's always a doctor of some kind in this type of flick ) and his sidekick Nestor Paiva ( here in a bigger part than usual as the sheriff ) ; we also get a sexy heroine in Mara Corday ( she later did similar duties in two other ' giant monster ' pictures , namely THE GIANT CLAW [ 1957 ] and THE BLACK SCORPION [ 1957 ] ) , and ever-reliable character actor Leo G . Carroll as the misguided ? and eventually deformed ? scientist . While the special effects of the rampaging spider seem variable at this juncture ( although rather better than I recalled them ) , they were probably considered state-of-the-art back then . Even so , perhaps the film's best sequence is the one where the monster attacks the doctor's house and lab , crushing them under its weight ; the image of the giant spider's eyes peering into Corday's window is still creepily effective ( and must have given 1955 audiences veritable nightmares ! ) . The satisfying climax ( featuring a bit by a very young pre-stardom Clint Eastwood ) first sees Agar , the authorities and the townsfolk unite in an attempt to deal with the arachnid their own way ? but , when this fails , they call a nearby military base for help ( whose speedy intervention , an obvious plug to the resourcefulness of the U . S . Air Force , proves infinitely more successful ) .
576626	1399158	67277	7.0	JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN ( Dalton Trumbo , 1971 )	I had always been intrigued by this film because of its ( admittedly morbid ) subject matter - and became even more so when I learned that Trumbo had originally approached my favorite director , Luis Bunuel , to direct it ! It's an undeniably effective anti-war parable which , though based on Trumbo's own 1939 novel ( set during WWI ) , proved especially timely in view of the ongoing controversy over the U . S . ' military involvement in Vietnam . Still , having a writer making his first ( and only ) stab at directing a film , the overall result is a brilliant one but which tends to be literate to a fault . Perhaps unconsciously , Trumbo inverts the technique used by The Archers in A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH ( 1946 ) by utilizing black-and-white for the present day occurrences and color for the flashback / fantasy sequences ; it must be said that the monochrome hospital scenes , though essentially repetitive , are suitably harrowing and poignant which indirectly seem like a plea for euthanasia . Unfortunately , Timothy Bottoms ' flashbacks are somewhat hit-and-miss : while some of them are quite moving ( particularly two episodes which feature Bottoms interacting with his girlfriend and a friendly whore who lived through the 1906 San Francisco ' quake ) , whimsical ( the scenes featuring Donald Sutherland as Jesus Christ , finding himself at a loss when it comes to aid Bottoms in his unique plight , are highly amusing , doubtless offensive to some and , most probably , the remnants of Bunuel's tenure in the project's development ) or absurdist ( his stint at the front-line , which is capped by the tragic and life-changing accident ) , others fall flat , particularly some of the fantasy sequences featuring Jason Robards as his shoe-maker / fisherman father and an irrelevant and lengthy bakery / send-off party sequence . That said , the rest of the cast is capably assembled ( it was a particular pleasure for me to watch Charles McGraw as Bottoms ' prospective father-in-law ) and Jerry Fielding contributes a typically impressive score . Obviously , Trumbo is best-known today for his troubles with HUAC but this film , while it could have benefited from firmer and more experienced control , is arguably his most personal statement and , deservedly I think , won him the Special Jury and F . I . P . R . E . S . C . I . prizes at the Cannes Film Festival , in a year in which one of the members of the Jury was Sergio Leone and where more renowned films like Nicolas Roeg's WALKABOUT ( 1971 ) and Louis Malle's MURMUR OF THE HEART ( 1971 ) went away empty-handed !
576294	1399158	36104	7.0	THE LEOPARD MAN ( Jacques Tourneur , 1943 )	Apart from its classic murder sequences ( particularly the first with its bloody pay-off ) , this one has an original , audacious structure ( criticized at the time because it was not understood ) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION ( 1994 ) , but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY ( 1974 ) ! ! Dennis O'Keefe is a wonderful lead as the sleuth figure ; in fact , the film is actually more of a thriller since the murders do not have a basis in the supernatural ( as was the case with the previous two Lewton / Tourneur collaborations ) . Though Jean Brooks is ostensibly the heroine , Margo is given more screen-time and her role is a lot more interesting : her performance as the doomed artiste - frequently resorting to her fortune-teller friend Isabel Jewell , who unfailing turns up the death card ! - is quite moving . James Bell underplays his pivotal role as the museum curator / animal expert ( which is similar to the brief doctor part he essayed in I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE [ 1943 ] ) ; also fine is Abner Biberman as the owner of the escaped leopard , who blacks out during his frequent drinking binges and thinks he may be the murderer . The small-town atmosphere is brilliantly captured on a studio set ( marred only by some corny elements in the script intended to accentuate the local color , such as the over-use of Margo's castanets - to the point where they even become a motif - or the birthday song delivered to the second victim of the titular creature . . . but , especially , the infuriatingly stupid mother of the little girl - who bullies her innocent and fearful daughter to an early grave ! ) ; the ' outdoor ' climax , then , is given an added touch of strangeness by taking place in the midst of a procession headed by a group of caped villagers ! Curiously , both the Leslie Halliwell and Leonard Maltin film guides give the running-time as a mere 59 minutes ; however , the two times I've watched the film , it's always been by way of the full-length 66-minute version ! William Friedkin's Audio Commentary is a good listen , despite his tendency to describe the on-screen action ( though almost always accentuated by his own interpretation of events ) ; this was his favorite among the Lewton horrors - and , in fact , it's very much underrated among fans but , personally , I loved it immediately !
577052	1399158	9973	7.0	BUMPING INTO Broadway ( Hal Roach , 1919 )	Despite the title , the plot of this Harold Lloyd short is evenly distributed among three different settings : a boarding-house , a theater and an exclusive club . As in FROM HAND TO MOUTH ( 1919 ) , comedy emerges out of the characters ' desperation - but there's no denying the assuredness of the gags ( in fact , I'd say that this one's an even better film ) and , in any case , H . M . Walker's title cards are among the wittiest for a Silent that I've come across ! Lloyd is in his element as the perennial dreamer , a novice playwright , and Bebe Daniels is an ideal co-star as an aspiring Broadway star . Still , the best scenes are probably those set in the casino - where the penniless Lloyd accidentally cops himself a large sum of money but , needless to say , he's not allowed to reap the rewards of his fortune because the joint is raided soon after by the Police !
575953	1399158	51706	7.0	THE HAUNTED STRANGLER ( Robert Day , 1958 )	Having been - as was the case with THE TIN DRUM ( 1979 ) - the one to ' announce ' several years ago the re-release on DVD of 4 Richard / Alex Gordon productions through Criterion on another online Forum ( after writing to Image Entertainment to see if their bare-bones OOP editions were going to be re-issued ) , this set has been a long time coming indeed ! As some of you may know , I'd never watched this one prior to purchasing the expensive " Monsters And Madmen " set - or , for that matter , its follow-up CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( 1958 ) ; however , I knew enough of their reputation as two of Boris Karloff's best latter-day films to make me spring for them regardless . To be honest , as I lay watching THE HAUNTED STRANGLER , I was somewhat let down by it and my heart actually sank when , in the Audio Commentary , both Richard Gordon and Tom Weaver opine that they prefer this one over CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ! Still , going through the film twice in a matter of hours can sometimes work wonders : at first glance , it's a handsome-looking yet rather lurid film - reveling in the permissiveness of the time to include as many ( often gratuitous ) instances of sleaze and sadism as it possibly could ; in that respect , it's similar to THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS ( 1959 ) - incidentally , another well-regarded title I had long wanted to watch and been underwhelmed by on a preliminary viewing . The film actually precedes Hammer's DR . JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE ( 1971 ) in that it mingles the Stevenson perennial with the equally popular exploits of Jack The Ripper ; to these it attaches a thriller angle by having Karloff act as a detective investigating an old series of murders , ostensibly to prove a miscarriage of justice , but whose repercussions are far worse - to say nothing of closer to home - than he could have imagined ( itself an oft-used device as in , say , THE BIG CLOCK [ 1947 ] ) ! While I knew of the twist from reading about the film beforehand ( and which is actually revealed fairly early in the game ) , I feel that it doesn't quite work here because , for one thing , the star was simply too old for the role ( though I'll readily admit that he entered with glee into its quite physical attributes , even coming up with the economical make-up design himself ! ) but also because the character's mental condition and its effect on his backstory is conveniently kept under wraps until the revelation ( when it should , at least , bother him equally as much as wanting to prove the innocence of an anonymous and legally convicted serial-killer ) . Incidentally , though strangulation is involved in the crimes , the film's title is somewhat misleading because it's the scalpel which sets the ' monster ' off and , for this reason , the U . S . moniker is rather more accurate ! Anyway , one of the film's major assets is surely Lionel Banes ' black-and-white cinematography ; the second half of the narrative , then , creates reasonable suspense and excitement with the scenes involving the rampaging ' monster ' and his ultimate identity crisis . In the end , I wouldn't really classify THE HAUNTED STRANGLER as one of the star's very best vehicles - but it's undoubtedly among the more satisfying from his later work that I've watched ( along with THE RAVEN [ 1963 ] and TARGETS [ 1968 ] ) . The DVD supplements are very adequate : the Audio Commentary featuring genre authority Tom Weaver and the film's producer Richard Gordon ( with interjections from his late brother / partner Alex ) is especially interesting - apart from the privilege of having Weaver and the two Gordons name their 3 favorite Karloff pictures , amongst many other things I learned that Boris once almost worked with Edward D . Wood Jr . ( and Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr . to boot ) on the project which eventually became BRIDE OF THE MONSTER ( 1955 ) !
576614	1399158	408236	7.0	Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street ( Tim Burton , 2007 )	I knew of the gory exploits of the Demon Barber via the 1936 barnstorming vehicle for British ham extraordinaire Tod Slaughter , though I haven’t watched that particular film itself ; on the other hand , I was vaguely aware that Stephen Sondheim had turned it into an unlikely but , by all accounts , successful musical . Tim Burton is a genuine but somewhat erratic talent but , whenever he joins forces with one of today’s finest actors – Johnny Depp – he seems to be particularly inspired , and this one’s no exception . As ever , the film’s visuals ( of a seedy and forbidding 19th century London ) are impeccable – and SWEENEY TODD deservedly emerged the Oscar winner in the art direction / set decoration category last Sunday night ! Interestingly , Depp had never sung on film previously but he does extremely well and , indeed , figured prominently – somewhat surprisingly ( this is a horror musical , after all ) but rightly so , in my opinion – among the year’s Best Actor nominees ; his brooding good looks are perfect for the character’s mix of pent-up emotions and cool viciousness . He’s matched by Helena Bonham-Carter , the director’s own mate , as the pie-shop owner who decides to spice up her traditional recipe – and is delighted to see the formerly dormant business flourish ( with the helping hand of revenge-seeking barber Depp ) ! The supporting cast is headed by reliables such as Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall and newer star acts like BORAT ( 2006 ) ’s Sacha Baron Cohen as a pompous traveling barber / charlatan ( and , hence , a rival / victim for Todd ) . SWEENEY TODD has been criticized for its vigorous blood-letting , and I do concede that Burton should have restrained his predilection for these grisly scenes – since they tend to become repetitive and , eventually , lead the film towards overlength at almost two hours . A local critic whose opinion I usually respect and value was underwhelmed by the film and only gave it ; he was also unimpressed by the songs or the actors’ idiosyncratic rendition of them ; I personally found Sondheim’s score quite effective and rousing at just the right moments . . . though , admittedly , it could also be grating i . e . whenever the actors have to sing separate choruses on top of one another . Similarly , Mrs . Lovett’s fantasy beach scene comes across as a distraction – as if we’d been suddenly thrown back to the environment of Burton’s own BIG FISH ( 2003 ) ! The narrative’s overwhelming Gothic bleakness remains unrelieved till the very end – with events leading to the inevitable frenzied climax tinged with a tragic irony ; we should perhaps have been allowed a ray of hope by being shown the young lovers united but , since the film is really about the plight of Depp’s character and his luckless wife , it’s appropriate that we stick with their fate .
576803	1399158	20691	7.0	THE BIG TRAIL { Standard Version } ( Raoul Walsh , 1930 )	Sweeping and still impressive early Talkie Western of pioneering days ; other contemporary films in the same vein include THE COVERED WAGON ( 1923 ) , THE IRON HORSE ( 1924 ) and CIMARRON ( 1931 ) ? none of which I've watched , though I do have the latter on VHS . It was simultaneously filmed in the " Standard " fullscreen ratio and in an experimental Widescreen process called " Grandeur " , but only the former has been released on the bare-bones Fox DVD ; one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio , but the careful framing ? not to mention the splendid cinematography ? is evident enough even in the " Standard " version . Young John Wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead ( a role which , however , didn't lead to the expected stardom ? as he'd languish in ' B ' Westerns for the best part of the next decade , before John Ford came to his rescue with STAGECOACH [ 1939 ] ! ) ; anyway , he and Marguerite Churchill ( from DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [ 1936 ] ) make a nice couple ? despite her somewhat tedious character . Supporting characters include a variety of stock types : veteran westerner , comic-relief sidekick ( with a penchant for making noises with his mouth ! ) , burly and uncouth villain ( played by Tyrone Power Sr . ! ) , his two slimy cohorts ( a Mexican and a Southerner , the latter also filling in as Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand ) , etc . Also among the members of the wagon party is a timid Swede ( full of optimism for the promised land , but who's continually put down by his irascible mother-in-law ) and later Wayne regular Ward Bond . The episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball , lyrical and action-packed vignettes ? as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements , the Indians and themselves ; the film , however , has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality . Also , the editing is somewhat choppy ( particularly during the second half ) ? little wonder , since the DVD edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158-minute " Grandeur " version !
576795	1399158	35957	7.0	GUADALCANAL DIARY ( Lewis Seiler , 1943 )	This is one of the better ( and most topical ) of Hollywood’s wartime efforts , but which seems to have been largely overlooked among the surplus of such films – possibly because it was helmed by journeyman director Seiler . Still , the handling is entirely professional and the film makes the most of a good script by Lamar Trotti – peopled with believable characters ably portrayed by a fine cast ( Preston Foster , Lloyd Nolan , Richard Conte , Anthony Quinn , Richard Jaeckel ) . The requisite comic relief provided by William Bendix and Lionel Stander is slightly overstated . . . but , then , Bendix delivers the film’s most moving speech towards the end . The film – unavoidably jingoistic but , at the same time , realistic i . e . thankfully free of gung-ho heroics – balances taut action sequences ( culminating in the so-called " Great Offensive " ) with a handful of undeniably powerful , lingering images ( particularly the line-up of dead U . S . marines ambushed on a beach by the devious Japanese forces ) . I’ll be following this with Cornel Wilde’s well-regarded BEACH RED ( 1967 ) , which also deals with WWII combat in the Pacific ; besides , I also own – but have yet to watch – the R2 DVD of Lewis Milestone’s contemporaneous THE PURPLE HEART ( 1944 ) , which tackles similar events from a unique perspective .
575988	1399158	75318	7.0	The Career Of A Chambermaid ( Dino Risi , 1976 )	This homage to Italy’s " White Telephone " films ( sophisticated comedy-dramas revolving around working-class girls ) of the 1930s gives Agostina Belli her best role – going from chambermaid to prostitute to singer to film-star to mistress of ‘Il Duce’ ! – for which she received a special David Di Donatello award , the Italian equivalent of the Oscar . Incidentally , the English title evokes memories of Octave Mirbeau’s ‘scandalous’ novel " Diary Of A Chambermaid " – thrice brought to the screen ( in Hollywood in 1946 by Frenchman Jean Renoir , in France in 1964 by Spaniard Luis Bunuel and in 1974 , typically as a sexploitationer , by prolific " Euro-Cult " exponent Jess Franco : the latter being the only one I haven’t watched and don’t own in any form ) . At other points in the narrative , the film also reminded me of A STAR IS BORN ( itself filmed several times ) and BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) , Bunuel’s celebrated classy treatment of prostitution . . . The rest of the cast here is interesting : Cochi Ponzoni is Belli’s unlucky boyfriend , sent to various war-fronts but always turning up to curse and / or embarrass the heroine ; Vittorio Gassman as an ageing matinée idol of the silver screen whose speech impediment forces him to be dubbed ( a character inspired perhaps by John Gilbert ) ; Renato Pozzetto is a Fascist who lands Belli into a bordello run by is own mother ! ; Lino Toffolo is a musician she meets at the whorehouse with a peculiar idiosyncrasy which sees him dressed in a baby outfit and asking Belli to bottle-feed him ! ; Alvaro Vitali ( future protagonist of the low-brow " Pierino " sex-comedy series ) is also taken to the joint – by his own father , who’s blissfully unaware of the boy’s homosexual tendencies ; and Ugo Tognazzi as a hunchbacked scavenger whose specialty is turning over Jews to the Fascists ! Its meticulous recreation ( especially the Venice locations , which include the Palazzo del Cinema , as well as the Excelsior Hotel my brother and I visited a number of times – clandestinely , I hasten to add – in September 2004 ! ) makes for a good-looking movie further blessed with a typically nice Armando Trovajoli score . However , despite its generally comic tone , the film is also effective as an expose ' of Fascism : at its most outrageous when Gassman plays a prank on his industrialist guests by faking a news flash in which it’s stated that the Government will be taking over all private enterprises – only to have one of them asking to be excused and proceeds to shoot himself in the next room ! ; Gassman’s own fortunes are dissipated with a spell in a private clinic ( due to substance abuse ) , and he turns up to Belli’s chagrin during a party inaugurating the coalition of German and Italian Fascists ; his own demise is poignant as , while playing a Fascist in a comeback role , he is mistaken for the genuine article by a band of partisans – they play at executing him via firing squad , but he actually expires out of sheer fright ! Finally , I should point out that the picture features a remarkably profane script which renders it particularly hilarious to those fluent in the language ( and are of the Catholic faith to boot ) !
577138	1399158	59729	7.0	THE SLENDER THREAD ( Sydney Pollack , 1965 )	The late Sydney Pollack tried his hand at several different genres and succeeded in most ; since he never demonstrated an individualistic style ( for many he was the antithesis of an auteur ! ) , he could adapt himself to virtually anything ( and Pollack often set his sights on grand themes ) – though the end result would always be somewhat artificial ( if undeniably slick ) because of the director’s impersonal approach ! Anyway , for his debut film , he settled on an intimate melodrama – shot on location in glorious black-and-white ( incidentally , all his subsequent work would be in color ) . The plot is simple : Sidney Poitier is a student who works nights at a Seattle Crisis Clinic ; on one occasion , a call comes in where a wealthy socialite at the end of her tether ( Anne Bancroft ) declares she has deliberately overdosed on barbiturates ! She phoned not so much because she wanted help but rather so that someone will know of her outcome ; Poitier , however , determines to keep her on the line – while he sets in motion a complex operation in order to trace Bancroft’s whereabouts and save her life . For about the first third of the film , Bancroft barely appears : we only hear her world-weary voice booming across the room at the clinic , Poitier having switched the call to the loudspeaker ; eventually , she starts to let her hair down and , in intermittent flashbacks , we see her movements during the last few days ( which boils down to her alienation from familial cords due to a past mistake which has come back to haunt her ) . While this was certainly a way to do it , I’m baffled as to why we never cut to where Bancroft is now until the last act : consequently , we have to contend with a fair bit of padding during the ‘re-enactments’ ( which could have easily been covered via dialogue delivered by the heroine ) ! That said , I guess it was a conscious decision on Pollack’s part to ‘open up’ the drama ( not merely to include other characters – most prominently , Steven Hill as the woman’s husband – but also to utilize a number of exteriors , where he was able to exercise a keen eye for realistic detail ) . Still , the film compels attention despite an essentially contrived central situation : for instance , at this point , it’s best not to go into how Bancroft manages to remain lucid for so long or , even more importantly , why she just doesn’t hang up on Poitier ; and what about the plausibility of the latter’s temper-tantrums ( to the exasperation of clinic psychiatrist Telly Savalas ! ) to coerce the woman into reacting , thus hanging on to life in spite of herself ? But that’s Hollywood for you . . . and , in a talky film such as this , the emphasis is on the writing ( by Stirling Silliphant ) and the acting ( Bancroft is typically excellent and Poitier’s contribution , amounting to a variation on his PRESSURE POINT [ 1962 ] role , just as good if slightly overstated in the long run ) . Even so , as a counter-balance to the ongoing histrionics , reasonable suspense – aided by up-to-date methods of detection – is generated throughout by the race-against-time to locate Bancroft . At the end of the day , THE SLENDER THREAD emerges as a quite impressive ( and generally still powerful ) first outing – recalling the gritty work of many a contemporary film-maker who , like Pollack , had emerged from TV .
578174	1399158	59792	7.0	PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES ( Mario Bava , 1965 ) Italian Version : ; U . S . Version :	I had long wanted to watch this solitary foray into sci-fi territory by the great Bava : however , even if the film was released on R1 DVD ( now OOP ) and I had actually owned a copy of the slightly different English-language version ( in Pan-and-Scan ! ) on DivX for some time , I'm glad I waited to catch it for the first time via the Italian original ; just for the sake of comparison , my viewing of the R2 DVD was followed with that of the DivX ? and , for all kinds of reasons , the former blows the latter out of the water ! Anyway , the film itself is a minor classic of the genre though not without its faults : admittedly , the Italian brand of sci-fi cinema hasn't been exactly prolific or impressive ? still , Bava's effort is miles ahead of the ones that I've watched so far . To begin with , something about the English title : the aliens / monsters here are actually more zombies than vampires ( the fact that one never knows who can be trusted also links it with both INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [ 1956 ] and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH [ 1964 ] ) ; hence , the original title ? TERRORE NELLO SPAZIO , i . e . TERROR IN SPACE ? is preferable , not only because it's more literary but it also lends mystery to the proceedings ( as the threat inherent in the plot line isn't categorized from the get-go ) . Curiously , Ib Melchior is credited as co-screenwriter on both the Italian and English versions ; early on , there's an overuse of nonsensical technical jargon ( which , in hindsight , takes away some of the surprise element from the ending ! ) , but this is thankfully downplayed in the film's latter stages . Of course , this being Bava , the look of the film ? actually similar to FORBIDDEN PLANET ( 1956 ) , it may well have inspired ALIEN ( 1979 ; with which it also shares much of the main theme ) ? is essential , and quite remarkable when considering the low-budget the director had at his disposal : the sets ? economical but undeniably stylish ? are very interesting , as are the various props on display ( that giant skeleton from an earlier civilization discovered on the planet is awesome ) ; while obviously modest , the visual / make-up effects are handled with great care and creativity ; the camera-work features an odd choice of angles mingled with Bava's typical zooms ; the pacing is generally terse but every opportunity to create mood and generate suspense is milked for all it's worth ; ultimately , the film's color scheme is so rich that one is almost tempted to turn off the audio and just allow himself to be immersed in the visuals ! Veteran Barry Sullivan makes for an imposing lead and Norma Bengell is his attractive co-star . Among the more notable sequences are the attack on Sullivan by his ' possessed ' crew ? very effective because it is unexpected ? and also the famous slo-mo rise of the shrouded monsters from their foggy graves . However , we also get a slightly confusing climax ( where the various characters become interchangeable due to their identical space-suits , especially when pursuing one another among the rocks ) ? but this is more than made up for by the double-twist at the end ( the first inspired , once again , by BODY SNATCHERS and the other deliciously chilling ) . As for the differences between the two versions of the film : the English-language edit has new and bland opening / closing shots , while some dialogue is either different or missing entirely ; worst of all here is Kendall Schmidt's horrid electronic score ( which , reportedly , had been added to the film by Orion and wasn't ported onto the R1 DVD ) ; on the other hand , the Italian print contains some minor extended bits ? but it's superior chiefly because of the more natural-sounding dubbing job . The only major complaint I have regarding the R2 DVD is that the audio is rather low ; the supplements are pretty minimal as well ( am I wrong in assuming that this won't be forthcoming as part of the Mario Bava series of R1 DVDs from Anchor Bay ? ) but , thankfully , the video has been recently remastered in anticipation of its screening during the Italian B-movie retrospective at the 2005 Venice Film Festival ( I had attended a similar and more extensive one the previous year , where I watched quite a few Euro-Cult gems ? but , alas , no Bava ! ) .
577394	1399158	28953	7.0	THE GREAT GARRICK ( James Whale , 1937 )	With every new Whale film I watch , it's becoming increasingly evident that it's not just his horror output that was unique ; this one , in fact ? the director's sole effort for Warner Bros . ? feels nothing like any of their productions ! The title would seem to suggest a biopic of the celebrated English actor ? many similar prestige films emerged from Hollywood during this time , such as THE GREAT ZIEGFELD ( 1936 ) and THE GREAT WALTZ ( 1938 ) ? but Whale and screenwriter Ernest Vajda concentrate instead on one curious incident ( the fact that it never actually occurred is immaterial ) . Most of the director's typical qualities ? and faults ? are to be found in the film : his eye for pictorial detail ( accentuated by Anton Grot's distinctive set design ) , the fluid camera-work ( courtesy of Ernest Haller ) , the dry English humor , etc . However , he also tends to over-indulge his character actors ( which , this being essentially a celebration of the art of performing , is hardly surprising in this case ) and , consequently , the film's initial momentum isn't sustained throughout ? the second half is somewhat chaotic and ham-fisted ? but picks up again for the splendid finale . Nevertheless , Whale biographer James Curtis considers THE GREAT GARRICK his last wholly satisfying film ? which , actually , makes me look forward all the more to watching THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK ( 1939 ) someday given its own solid reputation ! Inevitably , the cast has been carefully and most ably chosen : the underrated Brian Aherne is superb in the title role , while it's always a pleasure to see Edward Everett Horton ( playing nervous and cowardly as always ) ; among the endless list of supporting actors , perhaps the most impressive are Etienne Girardot ( funny and poignant as an elderly stage prompter and Garrick's most devoted fan ) and Luis Alberni ( a specialist in servant roles relishing his one-shot opportunity at essaying the showier part of a lunatic ) ; in contrast , demure Olivia De Havilland ? a Warners contract player ? feels somewhat lost in such company , to the point where additional close-ups were imposed by the studio ( notably the unwarranted and corny final shot ) . This stylish and delightful gem is truly one of the unsung films about the acting profession , in every way a worthy companion piece to such major works as Marcel Carne''s CHILDREN OF PARADISE ( 1945 ) and Jean Renoir's THE GOLDEN COACH ( 1952 ) . Unfortunately , the audio on the DVD-R I watched ( made from a TCM broadcast ) was occasionally accompanied by a distracting echo ; given Warners ' recent DVD release of Whale's WATERLOO BRIDGE ( 1931 ) ? as part of the " Forbidden Hollywood " set ? and the rumored one for SHOWBOAT ( 1936 ) ? along with two other cinematic adaptations of the popular musical ? I hope that THE GREAT GARRICK won't be left behind ( after all , those two films were actually Universal productions which became the property of Warners solely by virtue of the MGM remakes ! ) .
576441	1399158	65988	8.0	LITTLE BIG MAN ( Arthur Penn , 1970 )	Having first watched this in my childhood , my belated re-acquaintance with it didn't perhaps live up to expectations , but it's an undeniably impressive film nonetheless . Apart from a couple of sober sequences of Indians being massacred by General Custer and his men , the film pretty much treats the Old West in a humorous way - trashing many a myth in the process ! The Indians refer to themselves as the " Human Beings " , and it's clear where Penn's sympathies lie ; as a matter of fact , Chief Dan George was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar ( and deservedly so ) for his wonderful characterization of the old Indian sage who takes Dustin Hoffman under his wing . The ' white ' cast is impeccable as well , however - Hoffman ( who gets to age to a 121 ! ) and Faye Dunaway are in top form , but it's the character actors who really shine : Martin Balsam as the quack medicine salesman ( who loses a limb every time he appears ! ) , Jeff Corey as Wild Bill Hickock , and especially Richard Mulligan as a lunatic's idea ( ! ) of Custer . There were other films prior to this one which had dealt with the General's life - Raoul Walsh's THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON ( 1941 ) , with Errol Flynn , and Robert Siodmak's CUSTER OF THE WEST ( 1968 ) , with Robert Shaw - but , needless to say , their viewpoint had been far more traditional ( and glamorous ) ! For another idiosyncratic look at Custer , look no further than the typical Marco Ferreri oddity that is DON'T TOUCH THE WHITE WOMAN ! ( 1974 ) in which Custer is played by , of all people , Marcello Mastroianni ! Still , to get back to LITTLE BIG MAN , the ' realistic ' widescreen cinematography and a simple yet evocative score emerge as equally vital elements in the cementing of Penn's vision on the screen . The film arrived when the genre was already on a downward spiral , following the Spaghetti Western boom which flooded - and , in the process , gradually eradicated - the market . For this reason , most examples from the U . S . during this period were less nostalgic and opted to show the Old West , more or less , as it really was ( these were eventually dubbed " Revisionist " ) . By doing so , they were subtly commenting on the precarious state of modern America : for instance , the Indian massacre here ( a similar one was depicted in Ralph Nelson's excessively violent SOLDIER BLUE [ 1970 ] ) was a direct reference to the 1968 My Lai incident which occurred during the Vietnam War ! My viewing of LITTLE BIG MAN will , hopefully , result in my finally catching up with Robert Altman's equally unconventional BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS , OR SITTING BULL'S HISTORY LESSON ( 1976 ) - which I've had , taped off Italian TV , for an uncommonly long time now !
578180	1399158	39768	8.0	RIDE THE PINK HORSE ( Robert Montgomery , 1947 )	By stepping behind the camera for the first time with the Philip Marlowe mystery LADY IN THE LAKE ( 1947 ) , Robert Montgomery showed that , apart from being a likable actor , he was also an inventive film-maker . That opinion is more than consolidated in his second dual effort as star-director that was made in quick succession and on similar noir lines . Driven by a cracking script by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer , the movie tells of our world-weary ex-GI hero's attempt to avenge his buddy's death at the hands of vicious racketeer Fred Clark ? by extorting $30 , 000 in exchange for an incriminating personal cheque , or else turning him over to the federal authorities already on his heels in his Mexican hideout . Every performance is equally top-notch : from Montgomery himself ? upon his arrival at the bus depot , nonchalantly affixing the all-important locker key stuck into a piece of chewing gum to a directions board or , after receiving a serious knife-wound in the back , deliriously calling on his opponent to confront him all over again ? to Thomas Gomez's Oscar-nominated turn as the friendly carousel barker ; from Fred Clark's sleek , hearing-aid sporting villain to Art Smith's sympathetic government agent ; and from Wanda Hendrix ( soon to be , albeit very briefly , Mrs . Audie Murphy in real life ) as the enigmatic local girl who sticks by the hero's side like glue , to Andrea King as Clark's sultry accomplice seducing Montgomery within an inch of his life . Unjustly denied greater exposure among film buffs by its unavailability on DVD , it has thankfully been regularly shown on TCM USA ( which is where the copy I watched was sourced from ) ; it was subsequently remade for TV as THE HANGED MAN ( 1964 ) by another noir expert , Don Siegel , and featured quite a remarkable cast : Robert Culp , Edmond O'Brien , Vera Miles , J . Carroll Naish , Norman Fell , Seymour Cassel , Al Lettieri , Gene Raymond and Edgar Bergen .
576057	1399158	67144	8.0	THE GO-BETWEEN ( Joseph Losey , 1971 )	Richly-detailed period romantic drama , told more or less from a child's viewpoint but treated with the maturity one has come to expect from a Losey film ( the main plot is interspersed with fragmented clips of the boy as an old man - played by Sir Michael Redgrave - revisiting the aristocratic country estate where the majority of the narrative takes place ) . Though the characters are rather swamped by their surroundings ( the two leads are particularly subdued ) - as captured by the gleaming cinematography of Gerry Fisher and the elegant décor of Carmen Dillon - the film allows for several good performances from a sturdy cast , including Dominic Guard ( as the boy Leo who acts as messenger in the impossible love between upper-class Julie Christie and commoner Alan Bates , both of whom he idolizes ) , Edward Fox ( as Christie's intended , a war-hero ) , as well as Margaret Leighton and Michael Gough ( as her parents ) ; Leighton's role remains in the background for most of the time but , then , she asserts herself during the last third to bring down the couple's relationship - with the unwilling assistance of the bewildered Guard . Besides , Michel Legrand contributes an atypically ominous yet haunting score . This was the third and last time Losey and screenwriter Harold Pinter worked together , constituting a very fruitful and quite extraordinary collaboration ; for about two-thirds of its length , the film finds Losey somewhere near his best - the contemporary subplot where Leo reprises his ' services ' for an older Christie works less well , in my opinion ( and is too sketchily presented anyway ) , rendering an already deliberately-paced film somewhat overlong ! THE GO-BETWEEN won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival , was nominated for an impressive 12 BAFTA awards ( winning 4 ) but received only 1 Oscar nomination ( for Leighton as Best Supporting Actress ) .
578039	1399158	36341	8.0	THE SEVENTH VICTIM ( Mark Robson , 1943 )	This had been one of the most elusive of Lewton's classic horror films and , in fact , I only first caught up with it a couple of years ago on Italian TV ( where it was dubbed , of course ) . While I recall being very impressed with it then I only rated it a and , given that I boosted the rating now , one would naturally assume that I loved it even more ; however , the film's low-key nature doesn't make it ideal viewing after a long day's work - but , then , Steve Haberman's excellent Audio Commentary proved quite enlightening ( pointing out some of the subtleties I might have missed ) so that , by the time I was done with the DVD , I felt that I had ' got ' it sufficiently to merit that extra half a star ! As with the first three entries ( after which a change of director was ordered by RKO - but , then , he had to fight for first-timer Mark Robson ! ) , the film basically revolves around a number of highly-charged and brilliantly-handled suspense sequences : the walk down the dark corridor of the cosmetics shop ( the firm is pretentiously named " La Sagesse " , meaning Wisdom ) where an opportunistic but sympathetic pint-sized detective meets his doom ; a Hitchcockian scene aboard a train ; the shower sequence in which a member of the devil cult bursts in on lead Kim Hunter , warning her not to get involved any further ( though entirely different in development , this could well be the cinematic fore-runner of the legendary scene in PSYCHO [ 1960 ] ! ) ; yet another walk across a dark alley with a threat to one of the characters which could come at any moment and from any corner . The film is undercast , but effectively so : Kim Hunter is impressive in her debut performance ; her two suitors , however , are rather too fey - though the poet character is , at least , intriguing ( if giving rise to a decidedly over-literate script , already peppered with Lewton's typically pretentious quotations ! ) ; Tom Conway actually reprises his role from CAT PEOPLE ( 1942 ) , making it one of cinema's first examples of a prequel - since his character died in the earlier movie ! ; Jean Brooks - writer / director Richard Brooks ' wife - was a somewhat vapid heroine in THE LEOPARD MAN ( 1943 ) , but this quality ( accentuated by her dark wig , which is every bit as iconic as the one sported by Louise Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX [ 1928 ] and must have inspired Uma Thurman's look in Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION [ 1994 ] ) actually fitted like a glove her enigmatic and nihilistic character here ! Even though the latter does not make an appearance before the 30-minute mark of this 71-minute film - and she only has about 10 minutes of actual screen-time in all ! - her presence permeates the entire movie , much like Orson Welles ' Harry Lime would in THE THIRD MAN ( 1949 ) . Though , at first glance , the devil cult may not seem particularly sinister ( apart from their leader , Ben Bard ) the scene where they finally catch up with Brooks and attempt to induce her to suicide is superbly done ; then again , its depiction of Satanists as normal people who lead normal social lives anticipated ROSEMARY'S BABY ( 1968 ) by a quarter of a century ! The script also manages to sneak in several allusions to lesbianism ( which are there for anyone who cares to pick them up ) ; certainly an unusual emphasis for the time . It also features one of the bleakest endings to any film ( particularly coming from a Hollywood studio product ! ) , featuring yet another brief but haunting turn from Elizabeth Russell as a dying woman ; even though I was aware of how it was all going to end , it still took my breath away ( the closing lines - from a sonnet by John Donne - are unforgettable and among the greatest ever , in my opinion ) ! The Audio Commentary ( perhaps the finest in this Box Set ) goes into some detail about deleted footage that expanded on the interesting relationship in the film between Conway and the young poet , and also between Conway and a one-armed member of the cult ( whose role is severely diminished in the final film ! ) ; as a matter of fact , Conway's motives here are even more obscure than in CAT PEOPLE : he's seen as a prominent figure at the parties given by the devil-worshippers , and yet it's because Brooks spilled the beans to him that the latter want her dead ( he , meanwhile , seems intent on harboring her despite his cynical veneer ) ! Haberman also mentions the efforts of British film-makers to watch THE SEVENTH VICTIM in wartime ( American films of this era only reached foreign shores after the end of WWII ! ) - among them the Boulting Brothers , Carol Reed and Michael Powell ( the last , according to DVD Savant but which I can well believe , since Kim Hunter was cast in the added subplot for the alternate U . S . version of The Archers ' A CANTERBURY TALE [ 1944 ] ! ) - and a hilarious anecdote of scenarist De Witt Bodeen ( the script was co-written with Charles O'Neal , father of actor Ryan ! ) attending a real devil-worship meeting in which harmless-looking old ladies cast terrible spells on Hitler while nonchalantly sipping tea ! ! The theory of doubles he comes up with is interesting , too , if one I hadn't actually picked on myself ; regrettably , however , the Commentary omits biographical data for cast and crew members , which is usually thorough for even the minor characters ( as I would have liked to know more , for instance , about the actors who memorably played the ill-fated detective and an old newspaper woman - despite their limited screen-time ) .
577129	1399158	381061	8.0	CASINO ROYALE ( Martin Campbell , 2006 )	Against every conceivable odds , the 21st James Bond adventure is one of his best : the highly unpopular choice of leading man ( with die-hard fans of the series ) paid off in spades as blonde Daniel Craig - who had previously impressed more for his restrained acting than his animal magnetism in both ROAD TO PERDITION ( 2002 ) and MUNICH ( 2005 ) - lends the character a determination , temerity and , most importantly perhaps , vulnerability missing since the earlier Sean Connery incarnations . The fact that he was faced with the burden of playing one of the screen's most iconic characters and encountering such overwhelming opposition at first , seems to have merely aided in making Craig's characterization of James Bond as , ironically , more believable than perhaps ever before . This is not to say that the spectacular stunts and action sequences - not to mention Bond's enviable way with a witty line or prowess in the bedchamber - have been jettisoned or diluted in favor of realistic minimalism but , the fact remains that more time than usual is dedicated here to delving into the various characters appearing in the story instead of previous upping-the-ante tactics which necessitated numerous climaxes seeking to upstage not only the ones seen in previous films but even those within the film itself . The relationship between Bond and his partner Vesper Lynd ( the luscious Eva Green ) is one of the most emotional and satisfying in the entire series and , despite my initial misgivings prior to watching the film , Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a terrific opponent with a subtly effective make-up to go with his intense performance . The supporting cast is also worth mentioning : apart from Judi Dench ( who is by now filling in impeccably for the formidable Bernard Lee ) as M , we have Jeffrey Wright's bemused Felix Leiter and Giancarlo Giannini's reptilian Mathis , a welcome ally to Bond as he steps into the spider's lair that is the Casino of the title but , as usual with these spy sagas , loyalties - to say nothing of love - cannot be taken at face value . At 144 minutes , this is also the longest James Bond vehicle so far but as I mentioned earlier , CASINO ROYALE is easily the best of the series in 25 years ( at the very least ) . Frankly , I've only been able to take Roger Moore's overtly tongue-in-cheek James Bond persona in small doses , have had little use for Timothy Dalton's glumness and only been wholly satisfied with Pierce Brosnan's take in TOMORROW NEVER DIES ( 1997 ) . It is , therefore , very refreshing to see , for once , a James Bond film whose plot is not only exciting but , free as it is of the ingenious but distracting gadgets which proliferated in previous outings , also quite absorbing . The black-and-white introduction is a nice touch , the rather harrowing torture sequence is possibly a first for the series and , among the handful of action highlights , the crumbling of a Venetian edifice towards the end is as spectacular as they come .
576062	1399158	55597	9.0	VICTIM ( Basil Dearden , 1961 )	One of the best , if largely neglected , British films of the 60s ( perhaps because it wasn't made by an auteur ) ; despite receiving a couple of citations ( mentioned below ) , this controversial classic was conspicuously absent from the BAFTA's Best Film category - while a number of less deserving titles were ( in my opinion , Oscar consideration should not have been amiss either for such a fine piece ) ! The first film to openly deal with homosexuality - and especially the way it's looked at in Britain , where it was considered a criminal offense till 1966 ! - it does so in a very subtle and adult ( i . e . unsensationalistic ) manner . Cleverly , the excellent script ( a deserving BAFTA nominee ) approaches its delicate theme by way of a thriller plot involving several eminent personalities being targeted by a gang of blackmailers ; the details of their ' scandalous ' behavior is held off for as long as possible , which actually serves to suck the audience into the narrative from the very start . Interestingly , while several actors refused to appear in it , at least two well-known ( and highly-respected ) stars - Dirk Bogarde and Dennis Price - who were actually gay risked their reputation by not flinching from the material ! However , while Bogarde's career subsequently flourished with mature works for Joseph Losey and Luchino Visconti among others , Price's spiralled downwards and mostly degraded himself with thankless roles in cheap , sleazy exploitation fare ( most notably for Jesus Franco ) ! Tellingly , however , the film still cautiously depicts Bogarde as trying to suppress his true feelings and seek to live out a normal life with his on-screen wife Sylvia Syms who , uncharacteristically perhaps , also opts to stick by her man and face the upcoming turmoil together . Having said that , Bogarde had just played another sexually ambiguous character in Roy Ward Baker's eccentric semi-Western THE SINGER NOT THE SONG ( 1961 ) - in which his black-clad villain seems more interested in parson John Mills than leading lady Mylene Demongeot - and would go on to do so again in Visconti's DEATH IN VENICE ( 1971 ) . The entire cast of VICTIM - including plum roles for Norman Bird , Charles Lloyd Pack , Peter McEnery , Derren Nesbitt and Nigel Stock - delivers superb ( and sometimes moving ) performances , with Bogarde ( also a BAFTA nominee ) in peak form ; his sensitive scenes with Syms are especially effective . Production values receive equal consideration , with Otto Heller's striking location photography leading the pack . Basil Dearden ( whose film career ended prematurely with his tragic death in a car accident in 1971 ) may not have been one of the great directors but his career is a distinguished one and he tackled efficiently most types of subjects ; like VICTIM , however , his most notable work was done in the thriller genre - the seminal THE BLUE LAMP ( 1950 ; also featuring Bogarde ) , the racially-sensitive SAPPHIRE ( 1959 ) and the lighthearted caper THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN ( 1960 ) .
577132	1399158	16895	9.0	FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ( Sam Taylor , 1926 )	This is one of Harold Lloyd's least-known films and , consequently , perhaps his most underrated feature ; I was first made aware of this factor by Leonard Maltin's awarding it the full rating in his Film Guide and , ever since that time , I've been pining to catch up with it ! Now that I've watched it for myself , I can say that the film is an undoubted classic ( certainly among Lloyd's best work ) and the only reason that I didn't quite go all the way with my own rating is the fact that , even for its brief 58-minute running-time , the plot line is somewhat thin : Harold is a millionaire who becomes the unwitting benefactor of a modest mission ; believing himself to have been conned into such a position , he determines to put a stop to it - that is , until he meets and falls for pretty missionary's daughter Jobyna Ralston . Then , he resolves to attract customers to the joint - which , considering that the neighborhood is filled with tough guys and gangsters , this will take considerable resource on his part . Nevertheless , he succeeds and the men eventually become fond of him so that , when Lloyd's impending marriage to Ralston is announced in the papers and his rich society-pals decide to ' save ' him from such a fate , the gang take action to bring the couple back together again . While clearly reminiscent of what is perhaps Charlie Chaplin's greatest short , EASY STREET ( 1917 ) , the film's level of gags and the star's typical ingenuity is extremely high - with only the gangsters ' drunken havoc during its last third overstaying its welcome ; this section , however , leads to one of Lloyd's most hair-raising stunts - actually inspired by similar scenes in both GET OUT AND GET UNDER ( 1920 ) and GIRL SHY ( 1924 ) - as a double-decker bus ( with atop it the star and his ' flock ' ) races driverless along busy city streets on its way to Harold's wedding . Other hilarious highlights include : the early destruction of two cars owned by our reckless hero - the first happens because of a crate of cat food in the middle of the street , which the black chauffeur mistakes for the real thing and tries to avoid but ends up slamming straight into another car , while the second contrives to run out of gas on a railway track and is summarily scuttled by an oncoming train ; as well as another re-used ( this time from GRANDMA'S BOY [ 1922 ] ) but undeniably irresistible routine involving the indigestible ' cakes ' which Lloyd is made to eat by his beloved at the mission .
