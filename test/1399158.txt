577626	1399158	71227	1.0	THE BLACK SIX ( Matt Cimber , 1974 ) BOM	If it's at all possible , this one's even worse than THE BLACK GESTAPO ( 1975 ; see above ) : it concerns the revenge perpetrated by the free-spirited , peace-loving but ultimately tough brother ( and his five equally brawny cronies ) of a black man killed by a group of bikers for daring to go out with a white girl . The title characters are played by a variety of American Football stars but , apart from the novelty factor , this does the film no good as none of them can act - not that the rest of the cast is any better , as witness the old woman for whom they work early on in the film or the hysterical owner of the roadhouse diner they end up trashing after being insulted by their racist clientele ! Even at this juncture , I can hardly remember anything about it - except for the exaggerated Afro hairstyle of the lead character's radical younger sister who rebukes him for going off on their bikes rather than joining the Black Cause - after which one of the guys tells him , " Ma-aaa-n , you have one he-aaaa-vy li'l sistah ! " Also , the print I watched was so muddy and dark that , due to the characters ' skin color , I could hardly distinguished one from the other , especially during the climactic fight ! ! There's also an eccentric white biker named Thor who , appropriately enough , dons a Viking helmet but I have no idea what he really had to do with the main plot at the end of it ! Finally , the end credits show a hilarious title card which warns white " honkies " that if they " hassle a brother " , they'll find the Black Six on their heels . . . or something ! The director later made the intriguing horror film THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA ( 1976 ) - whose R1 SE DVD from Subversive Cinema I've been eyeing for purchase for the longest time - but , after watching this piece of trash , I'll think twice before going for it as a blind buy . . .
577917	1399158	82700	1.0	CANNIBAL FEROX ( Umberto Lenzi , 1981 ) BOM	This film is an imitation of an already poor prototype ? Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST ( 1979 ) ; ironically , the latter had spoken disparagingly of it at the 2004 Venice Film Festival ( to which Lenzi was himself invited though , of course , he wasn't present at the time ) . The only thing going for it is an appropriately doom-laden score ; otherwise , it emerges to be a barrage of pointlessly exploitative images ? from the totally gratuitous anaconda sequence to the extended and hilariously inventive torture scenes ( my favorite was the brain severing ) . Besides , the subplot involving the NYPD inserted to pad out the running-time feels completely out of place here ! Obnoxious characters , too , prevent any audience sympathy ? which only serves to make the journey even more of an ordeal ! The would-be ironic ending , then , is just stupid : at least CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST had questioned who the real cannibals were but , here , the leading lady ( who was so keen initially to disprove their existence ) has an unconvincing about-face by opting to do the conservative thing and sweep the whole matter under the proverbial rug ! P . S . While my father is usually averse to even the mildest of horror films ( being just not keen on the genre ) , I was surprised to learn that he had watched excerpts from a cannibal-related title some time ago on late-night Italian TV ; he still recalled a couple of the more outrageous moments from it , and it turned out that the film he was referring to was none other than CANNIBAL FEROX ! !
577807	1399158	55946	1.0	Eegah ( 1962 ) BOM	Unlike THE PRINCESS BRIDE ( 1987 ) , this one fully deserves its reputation as one of the worst films ever . I couldn't stop laughing at the amateurishness of it all , from the inane premise to the ghastly acting ( especially Arch Hall Jr . , who even displayed his inexistent talents as a rock'n'roll performer ) to the obviously post-synched soundtrack , where at several instances dialogue ( or grunts in the case of the caveman ) could be heard when it was evident that the characters ' lips weren't even moving ! ! The caveman's would-be rampage at the end is especially pitiful . As much as I ' enjoy ' myself watching bottom-of-the barrel garbage like this , I can't bring myself to give them a higher rating than BOMB - even if I can't say that I was bored with it ( as was the case with , say , THE BROWN BUNNY [ 2003 ] ) . . .
575954	1399158	91164	2.0	HALF MOON STREET ( Bob Swaim , 1986 )	From the title and what little I knew about its subject-matter , I was expecting a BELLE DE JOUR-meets-JACK THE RIPPER kind of thing but imagine my disappointment when , after an intriguing start , this is forsaken for boring political machinations which ineffectively breach thriller territory towards the end . Actually , it gets sillier by the minute : from having Sigourney Weaver ( playing a researcher in Anglo-Arab relations moonlighting as a high-class escort ) chatting up an Arab playboy's cinematic banter at a society party with " Am I supposed to say ' Your place or mine ? ' " to which he retorts , " No , these days you say " Betamax or VHS ? ' " ; to seeing Michael Caine ( as a celebrity British diplomat ) standing in the rain holding out a bouquet of flowers for Weaver - whom he has fallen for in the course of her extra-curricular activities and with whom he has had a minor falling out ! Still , the often-nude Weaver is nevertheless quite good in her role but the film is certainly no BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) and it is easy to see why Bob Swaim's career went downhill very quickly after having made the excellent French policier LA BALANCE ( 1982 ) .
578222	1399158	38974	2.0	THE SPIDER WOMAN STRIKES BACK ( Arthur Lubin , 1946 )	Despite the title and the presence of two of Sherlock Holmes ' most formidable nemesis ( Gale Sondergaard and Rondo Hatton - hilariously named Zenobia and Mario respectively ! ) , this is one lame film which has nothing whatsoever to do with one of the better Universal Sherlock Holmes entries . As a matter of fact , the story is weak , the premise far-fetched , the resolution predictable and the treatment uninspired ! Besides , the fiery climax is clumsily executed and Hatton's fidgeting . . . er . . . sign language eventually gets on one's nerves ! It's fair to say , then , that director Lubin fared much better with the other two ' horror ' films he made for the studio - BLACK Friday ( 1940 ) and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA ( 1943 ) , even if these weren't completely satisfying either . . .
576066	1399158	56950	2.0	HERCULES AGAINST MOLOCH ( Giorgio Ferroni , 1963 )	This peplum has to be one of the low points of the entire genre : not only does it not generate any interest or particular excitement throughout ( most of the time I was merely confused by the plot overcrowded with factions , conspirators and usurpers ) , but the title itself is a cheat : Hercules doesn't really feature in it at all - it's merely the name under which hides muscle-bound hero Gordon Scott , actually the prince to a neighboring empire attempting to free Mycenae from the influence of paganism and the ruling corruption and sadism ; Moloch , then , is nothing like the man-eating God seen in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS ( 1927 ) but the disfigured heir - with his face hidden behind an iron mask shaped like a wolf's head ! - to the throne who's kept hidden in the dungeons ( with a line-up of drum-beating females as company ! ) and occasionally offered victims he can amuse himself with by shooting at them with arrows . Actually , the latter scenes are nicely atmospheric ( director Ferroni had earlier made the fine Gothic-horror piece MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN [ 1960 ] ) ; by the way , the minor peplum LE BACCANTI ( 1961 ) - also helmed by Ferroni - had featured a similar set of underground females , while some of the exterior scenes appear to have been lifted from the director's own - and vastly superior - THE Trojan WAR ( 1961 ) ! Interestingly , the villainous female lead is played by Rosalba Neri who's undeniably attractive but not yet the favored raunchy starlet of Euro-Cult ; also in the cast are Arturo Dominici ( as a despicable officer in Neri's service ) and Michel Lemoine ( in view of his unusual looks , it's surprising to find him on the side of the righteous and carry the film's secondary love interest to boot ! ) . Note : according to the DVD Drive-In review for Trimark's Box Set " The Adventures Of Hercules " , in which this film is included , it's written that Tim Lucas suspects that Mario Bava may have been involved in its making ; apart from the lighting scheme in the dungeon scenes with Moloch , as already mentioned , it's hard to agree with this - but , then , Bava's own peplums hardly constitute his best work . . .
577637	1399158	890870	2.0	SAW IV { Unrated Version } ( Darren Lynn Bousman , 2007 )	Director Darren Lynn Bousman must be doing something right to be handed the reins of three successive entries in the SAW franchise ; for the life of me , however , I can’t figure out what the damn thing is because it seems to me that the series is getting progressively worse with each new sequel . The fourth film , therefore , is the worst of the lot – not because it is the goriest ( which I don’t think it is , curiously enough ) but because it doesn’t make a lick of sense – at all ! The film-makes clearly assume that whoever ventures into this one is already familiar with the earlier movies but , frankly , I lost the plot completely a couple of times while trying to remember who every newly-introduced character is ( or was supposed to be in the prequels ) . As far as I know , the character of Jigsaw ( finally ) expired in SAW III ( 2006 ) but he is all over the place in this one , too ! – both under his real , normal identity ( in a series of flashbacks depicting the miscarriage of his child , etc . ) and in any number of his silly costumed video messages from beyond the grave ( or whatever ) . I don’t really need to go into all the gory details of the various torture sequences seen throughout but the dismemberment of the sadistic fat slob is perhaps the ( comic ) highlight ; still , Jigsaw’s schemes are always so incredibly tortuous that , more than anything else , they make him seem like an elderly , human and more successful version of Wile E . Coyote ! ! Angel of vengeance-cum-serial killer , my eye . . .
576428	1399158	73856	4.0	IN SEARCH OF Dracula ( Calvin Floyd , 1975 )	I'd long been interested in this documentary on the history behind the archetypal vampire figure due to Christopher Lee's involvement ( as both narrator and actor ) but also given the fact that director Floyd would follow it with the well-regarded THE TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN ( 1975 ) , a faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's horror classic . However , the result in this case is mainly dull and patchy at best : not only were several of the accounts involving " Dracula " novelist Bram Stoker and the inspirations for his creation ( chiefly the notorious Vlad the Impaler ) already familiar to me ? but such other interjections as J . Sheridan LeFanu's equally famous female vampire story " Carmilla " , the way the inherently predatory nature of femme fatales drew upon that of the vampire ( hence the epithet ' vamp ' ) , or the documentation of a real-life modern-day blood-sucker ( who may well have inspired George A . Romero's MARTIN [ 1978 ] ) felt like padding more than anything else ! The film's real coup , then , lies in the makers ' decision to shoot in authentic locations ? which , amazingly , have retained their Old World and genuinely eerie quality . Even so , Lee ( who appears as Vlad himself and , of course , Dracula in both an ageing guise ? the way he was actually depicted in the original ? and , bafflingly , excerpts from the Hammer film SCARS OF Dracula [ 1971 ] ) looks positively bored throughout , in spite of his typically authoritative voice ! Besides , the segment on Dracula's cinematic incarnation ? with obvious references to NOSFERATU ( 1922 ) , Bela Lugosi and , naturally , Lee's own stint in the part ? comes across as disappointingly schematic ?
577846	1399158	61015	4.0	SPINOUT ( Norman Taurog , 1966 )	This wasn't shown in time for the 30th anniversary from Elvis Presley's passing , but it did turn up on TCM UK some time later ; still , it took me this long to watch and , as a matter of fact , only opted to check the film out alongside two contemporary vehicles by fellow singers Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin – that said , it can't really compare with them ! It's the second of three Presley titles with a racing milieu , though this element isn't as much to the fore here as in the others ; conveniently , he doubles as a swooning singer / guitarist with a band – and most of the running-time sees him dodging a couple of marriage proposals from eminent figures in the community ! It transpires that even the tomboyish female drummer in his outfit secretly pines for him . . . but , given the film's jejeune nature , everything is neatly sorted out by the end – as a writer researching The Perfect Male eventually hitches up with Presley's proposed racing employer ( played by a U . S . TV stalwart who was completely unknown to me but is a real dead ringer for Darren McGavin ! ) , the latter's young daughter ( Shelley Fabares , from the star's earlier vehicle GIRL HAPPY [ 1965 ] ) realizes she loves her father's goofy secretary after all , and the drummer ( who's something of a gourmet ) finds a like-minded soulmate in , of all things , a highway policeman ! Not that it matters much given their thankless roles but two veteran character actors from Hollywood's Golden Age - Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel - also appear in this film . The songs aren't exactly memorable either and , while the film's certainly harmless in itself , it's also not engaging enough to warrant more than a cursory viewing ( I , for one , was greatly surprised to learn that it was co-scripted by Theodore J . Flicker – who , soon after , would write and direct the cult political satire THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST [ 1967 ] with James Coburn ) . . .
578046	1399158	47960	4.0	Creature With The Atom Brain ( Edward L . Cahn , 1955 )	This one's basically an update of Boris Karloff's Mad Doctor cycle of the 1930s and 1940s , many of which were actually made at Columbia . It concerns an ex-gangster teaming up with an eminent German scientist who has fallen into disrepute of late ; together , they contrive to re-animate a series of dead bodies ( apparently , their second life-expectancy is very short ! ) in order to eliminate the people involved in convicting the mobster ? unsurprisingly , some of the victims end up themselves as zombies ! ! In this respect , the film is mildly entertaining ? but , in view of the utter lack of novelty on display ( the means of resuscitation may have changed but the result is the same as before ) , it tends to feel draggy even at a mere 69 minutes ! A measure of the film's low-budget is the fact that the montage half-way through of the zombies ' exploits is assembled from shots that would eventually form part of the film's very own climax ! The lead here is played by lanky Richard Denning ( from TARGET EARTH [ 1954 ] and THE BLACK SCORPION [ 1957 ] ? neither of which I've watched ) as a scientist / cop . By the way , director Cahn later made the similarly cheapskate IT ! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE ( 1958 ) . CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is actually the first Sam Katzman-produced horror film I've checked out ? and it's one of four that were recently packaged together in Columbia's ongoing " Icons Of Horror " series of genre Box Sets ; a second , THE GIANT CLAW ( 1957 ) , followed this straight away ? and , even if I wasn't exactly enthused with either of them , I'd still like to catch up with the remaining two titles ( namely THE WEREWOLF [ 1956 ] and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU [ 1957 ] ) . Incidentally , watching this I was reminded of a couple more low-brow sci-fi outings I had rented as a double-feature DVD some years back , which I might as well add to my collection at this juncture i . e . Edgar G . Ulmer's very minor THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN ( 1960 ) and the semi-interesting THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE ( 1962 ) ?
576243	1399158	87247	4.0	FEAR CITY ( Abel Ferrara , 1984 )	This early flick from Abel Ferrara piles on the sleaze as it deals with a group of strippers being hounded by an unknown night-time assailant ; from a surprisingly good cast for such cheap exploitation fare , Melanie Griffith scores best as the most popular stripper around , who also happens to be her moody boss ( Tom Berenger ) ' s ex , indulges in a lesbian relationship on the side ( with fellow stripper Rae Dawn Chong ) and turns into a full-blown junkie when the latter dies at the hands of our good friend , the serial killer . Nice clean family fare , then , right ? While the film remains watchable throughout and even has a handful of amusing sequences ( most notably when , having been mistaken for the killer , the wrong guy gets beaten up in the kitchen of one of these clubs ) and performances ( in particular , Michael V . Gazzo as an irascible strip-joint owner ) , it is seriously damaged by a frankly dull hero ( or rather anti-hero , since we're basically talking about an ex-boxer-turned-pimp here ) and a very silly villain ( a karate expert / fitness freak / budding writer ) . Billy Dee Williams also stars as an irate cop disgusted by all the squalor around him and Rossano Brazzi turns up for a free plate of pasta as the pre-requisite " respectable " mobster overseeing NYC's underworld . For the record , the film was originally bankrolled by Twentieth-Century Fox but they eventually sold the property to an independent company in view of its objectionable content and a cleaned-up , padded-out version eventually made the rounds on US TV and European videos ; also , the actor playing the serial killer remains uncredited to the end , just as the killer's name is never known throughout the film .
576176	1399158	282587	4.0	Family Theater : I Beheld His Glory ( TV ) ( John T . Coyle , 1953 )	This pretty much presents the same familiar story as HILL NUMBER ONE ( 1951 ) , though shot in color ? so , in fact , does the following film THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION ( 1958 ) ? but it's told from the viewpoint of a Roman officer ( George Macready ) . Curiously enough , Macready is actually not actively involved in any of the events on the way to Calvary and he catches the Christianity bug from his various conversations with the doubting Apostle Thomas ! As if that wasn't enough of a handicap to one's involvement into the whole affair , the treatment is pretty stolid overall and easily emerges as the least rewarding of the four modest films made by various evangelical groups about Christ's Passion that I watched in quick succession .
577581	1399158	55302	4.0	PIRATES OF TORTUGA ( Robert D . Webb , 1961 )	One of the myriad cheapies churned out by independent film producers ( here Sam Katzman ) under the aegis of a major Hollywood studio ( 20th Century Fox ) and which revolves around the exploits of a notorious pirate figure ( Sir Henry Morgan ) . Despite being fully aware of the film’s non-reputation even among others of its type , I was still taken in by the relatively decent cast ( Robert Stephens , Leticia Roman and John Richardson ) and the promise of colorful entertainment ( brought on by my recent spate of similar superior outings ) . Unfortunately , PIRATES OF TORTUGA falls far short of earlier movies about Morgan – THE BLACK SWAN ( 1942 ) or even the contemporaneous MORGAN , THE PIRATE ( 1961 ) – and proves to be a lackluster affair with a poverty of imagination on display that is quite dispiriting . To start with , Morgan ( an over-the-top Stephens ) himself only appears half-way through with the result that we are left largely in the company of a truly overbearing gypsy of a leading lady ( Roman ) , a listless hero ( Ken Jones ) and his puerile cronies ( Richardson and Dave King ) . Add to that the intermittent usage of action stock footage lifted from earlier Fox seafaring productions , the uncharacteristic popping up of modern slang in the dialogue and the sheer predictability of the whole venture and it’s small wonder that very little time has elapsed before the film starts to sink . . . right out of one’s memory ! For the record , director Robert D . Webb had much earlier won an Oscar as an assistant director ( in one of the few times these awards where handed out ) on IN OLD CHICAGO ( 1937 ) and had also guided Elvis Presley through his first film LOVE ME TENDER ( 1956 ) ; incidentally , I might get to check out six ( ! ) of his other directorial chores in the future : not just two notable Westerns WHITE FEATHER ( 1955 ; with Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner , which I have in my DVD collection ) and THE PROUD ONES ( 1956 ; with Robert Ryan and Jeffrey Hunter again , which I intend to acquire ) but also a few more available at local DVD rental outlets : BENEATH THE 12-MILE REEF ( 1953 ; which I haven’t watched in ages ) , the aforementioned LOVE ME TENDER , THE CAPE TOWN AFFAIR ( 1967 ; a remake of Samuel Fuller’s PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET [ 1953 ] ) and THE JACKALS ( 1967 ; featuring Vincent Price and a remake of William A . Wellman’s YELLOW SKY [ 1948 ] , which I own and intend to watch presently as part of my ongoing Richard Widmark tribute ) .
577488	1399158	86984	4.0	BODY DOUBLE ( Brian De Palma , 1984 )	De Palma's thrillers are always worth watching for their instantly recognizable style - and even more for his myriad borrowings from the work of Alfred Hitchcock ! Here , however , he seems somewhat unsure of himself as he even turns to his own earlier films for inspiration : while the main theme of Craig Wasson as a voyeur clearly owes a debt to REAR WINDOW ( 1954 ) , his obsession over a woman comes from - what else ? - OBSESSION ( 1976 ; and , by extension , VERTIGO [ 1958 ] ) , the film-making milieu ( with the nostalgic title sequence being especially nicely done ) from BLOW OUT ( 1981 ) and the ruse of committing a murder in disguise ( in order to put the lead character - and the audience with him - off the track ) from DRESSED TO KILL ( 1980 ; and , obviously , PSYCHO [ 1960 ] ) ! Still , the mystery isn't particularly involving - though Wasson isn't bad in registering his character's curiosity and confusion , while being able to romance both the victim ( Deborah Shelton ) and her double ( Melanie Griffith ) - and , other than adding an extra element of sleaze , the porn subplot is more of a distraction than anything else ! The villain , too , is totally uninteresting which rather makes the resolution less compelling - though the excessive violence ( Shelton is pinned to the floor with a power drill ! ) , camera gymnastics and , above all , Pino Donaggio's typically wistful score certainly keep one watching . . . even if De Palma has clearly made better films !
577142	1399158	71568	4.0	GOLDEN NEEDLES ( Robert Clouse , 1974 )	Despite bringing together a newly-born film star – Joe Don Baker , fresh from the box-office smash , WALKING TALL ( 1973 ) – and action director – Robert Clouse , of ENTER THE DRAGON ( 1973 ) fame – this a lamentably lackluster martial arts flick about the search for ( or rather the chase after ) a bronze statue which contains seven golden all-curing acupuncture needles which is craved by various parties . Baker is a retired detective slumming it out in Hong Kong who is hired by an enterprising ‘cowgirl’ ( Elizabeth Ashley ) to look for the titular commodities on behalf of her mysterious employer . Baker comes in possession of the statue early on in the game but it is subsequently stolen from the house of an old Asian teacher of his who is murdered ; consequently , he teams up with his colored partner Jim Kelly ( saddled with an Afro hair-do typical of the era ) in L . A . to go after the bad guys – with a little help from a butt-kicking Asian policewoman and her colleagues . Hollywood veterans Burgess Meredith ( as the villainous old businessman who seeks immortality ) and Ann Sothern ( as a Hong Kong madam who takes punishment like a man to protect Baker ) bring some much needed spice to the largely indifferent proceedings .
576829	1399158	79319	4.0	HURRICANE ( Jan Troell , 1979 )	In view of the disaster-movie cycle of the 1970s , somebody got the bright idea of remaking the John Ford classic THE HURRICANE ( 1937 ) ? lavishing on it a considerable budget , a handful of stars , and the best that special effects wizardry could afford at the time ; however , the end result was so dreadful ( and old-fashioned ) that the film proved a notorious flop ! The setting ( adapted from a book by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall , best-known for another adventure with an exotic backdrop , " Mutiny On The Bounty " ) is a South Sea island run by the American Navy ; the arrival of the Governor's daughter causes a commotion ? the newly-crowned native King forsakes his local girl for the white woman's charms ; this obviously creates problems between the two sets of inhabitants , who do not wish to have their blood mingle ? but , before the situation can be resolved , the Forces of Nature contrive to mete out their own form of justice ( via the titular catastrophe ) . Jason Robards Jr . is the Governor , Mia Farrow his daughter , and Dayton Kane the young ruler ; besides , Max von Sydow is a doctor , Trevor Howard a priest , Timothy Bottoms a Navy officer ( with feelings for Farrow ) and James Keach as Kane's hostile keeper ( the latter having been convicted of his fiancé's death , who drowned after fleeing a ceremony in which her virginity was to be ascertained ! ) . Despite enviable credentials ? producer Dino De Laurentiis , acclaimed Swedish director Troell , cinematographer Sven Nykvist , composer Nino Rota ( whose contribution is particularly notable ) and production designer Danilo Donati ? the film is something of a snoozer , with endless footage devoted to local color and the unconvincing central romance ? until the spectacular climax ( but which still isn't really enough to redress the balance ) ! Having re-acquainted myself with this ( I'd already watched it as a kid ) , I hope someday to get a fresh appraisal of the Oscar-winning original as well ; it was available on DVD very early into the format , but hasn't been re-issued since going out-of-print !
577871	1399158	60124	4.0	THE MAN FROM NOWHERE ( Michele Lupo , 1966 )	This is the eighth Spaghetti Western I've watched starring Giuliano Gemma - the others had been A PISTOL FOR RINGO ( 1965 ) , THE RETURN OF RINGO ( 1965 ) , FORT YUMA GOLD ( 1966 ) , DAY OF ANGER ( 1967 ) , A SKY FULL OF STARS FOR A ROOF ( 1968 ) , THE PRICE OF POWER ( 1969 ) and SILVER SADDLE ( 1978 ) . All of them are superior to THE MAN FROM NOWHERE - which turned out to be a sub-standard example of the genre and , though not an intentional parody , is so clichéd as to seem that way ! Incidentally , the U . S . title is quite stupid since the main character ( named Arizona Colt - also the film's original title ) explicitly states he is named after the state he hails from ! ! Fernando Sancho ( again ) is the trigger-happy chief villain ; among his ragged outlaw gang is a drunkard Mickey Shaughnessy type who , unsurprisingly , befriends the hero - while favorite Euro-Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears as a saloon-hostess , though she's killed off almost immediately ! The film is stretched to a length of almost two hours for no very good reason which , with a none-too-exciting plot line at its centre ( concocted by the ubiquitous Ernesto Gastaldi ) , quickly becomes tedious ; even so , it does work its way to a good climax ( with the hero utilizing a fake pair of hands to divert his adversary's attention , followed by a shoot-out in semi-darkness inside a funeral parlor ) . The Wild East DVD I watched was extremely poor , which certainly didn't help my involvement in the film any : first off , the English dubbing is horrendous ( Gemma's character is saddled with a ludicrous Southern accent ) ; the muddy print - presented in a masked 1 . 85 : 1 ratio so as to simulate the original 2 . 35 : 1 Techniscope format ! - features a number of jarring jump-cuts ( indicating missing or damaged frames and suggesting , somewhat distressingly , that the film's supposed to be even longer than it already is ) and , during one early instance , even falls several generations below the already unsatisfying standard on display . For the record , THE MAN FROM NOWHERE had a follow-up in ARIZONA COLT , HIRED GUN ( 1970 ) - with a different actor in the lead ( Anthony Steffen ) , it's mainly notable for being Sergio Martino's debut film .
576334	1399158	5336	4.0	La Folie Du Docteur Tube ( Abel Gance , 1915 )	It’s ironic that , of Gance’s more celebrated Silent work , this should be the one I watch first : it’s a one-reel short about a mad scientist – hence its inclusion in the " Horror Challenge " , though the tone throughout is distinctly comical ! The titular figure is played by Albert Dieudonne – later the incarnation of Napoleon in the director’s eponymous epic of 1927 – and who’s fitted here with an exaggerated domed head , which he finally shelters inside a cage ! Even so , its raison d’etre is Gance’s use of the wide-angle lens in depicting the disorientating effect on people when subjected to a drug ( in the form of dust particles ) concocted by the protagonist . However , this gimmick – which actually prevents one from following what’s going on ! – is kept up for an inordinate length of time : consequently , even at a mere 10 minutes , the gimmick outstays its welcome . . .
576338	1399158	63612	4.0	SKIDOO ( Otto Preminger , 1968 )	Perhaps stemming from a desperate need to remain relevant during a period of constant and drastic change , Hollywood's most serious film directors ? among them , Joseph Losey , John Huston and Otto Preminger ? tried their hands at zany comedy during the 1960s and even embraced the counter-culture for a while ; thus , we were subjected , in quick succession , to MODESTY BLAISE ( 1966 ) , CASINO ROYALE ( 1967 ) and SKIDOO . Earlier still , we even had the foremost message-monger in filmdom , Stanley Kramer , concoct that epic comedy IT'S A MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD WORLD ( 1963 ) ? which , however , would prove to be a far more successful enterprise than any of the others that followed later in the decade . In fact , prior to this , Otto Preminger was the main contender for Stanley Kramer's title and had been directing a succession of ponderous , self-important message pictures like EXODUS ( 1960 ) and HURRY SUNDOWN ( 1967 ) ? to mention the least of them . In the words of David Thomson , " . . . of all the Hollywood veterans , none seems to have lost his way as completely as Preminger . . . " and , as a matter of fact , the director's career took a nose-dive following BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING ( 1965 ; arguably his last good work ) , and the film under review is exceeded in awfulness only by ROSEBUD ( 1975 ; which I'd pick as his career nadir ) ; nevertheless , I wouldn't mind catching up with the one remaining film from this period , the black comedy SUCH GOOD FRIENDS ( 1971 ) . Therefore , while I knew of SKIDOO's bad reputation going in , I was still unprepared for how lame it actually was . Clearly aiming for the style of the hip , anything-goes comedy extravaganzas prevalent at the time ? spearheaded by WHAT'S NEW , PUSSYCAT ? ( 1965 ) ? unfortunately , it doesn't have the necessary in either plot ( gangsters learn to " Make Love , Not War " after meeting up with a community of hippies ) or laughs ( there are a few scattered chuckles but nothing side-splitting or truly memorable ) to be anything more than a messy curiosity ! Personally , I am an admirer of Preminger's but I found practically nothing of his personality here and his approach to the material is as heavy-handed as was to be expected after treating all those serious subjects for so long ( in spite of having worked closely with the great Ernst Lubitsch during the latter's final years ) . Preminger did have a knack for rounding up impressive all-star casts for his movies , however , and the line-up he roped in for SKIDOO was , at least on paper , certainly no exception : Jackie Gleason , Carol Channing ( who even gets to sing Harry Nilsson's catchy title song at the climax while dressed up as Napoleon Bonaparte ! ) , Frankie Avalon , Fred Clark ( who's quite fun as a prison guard fed LSD ) , Frank Gorshin , Richard Kiel , John Phillip Law ( as the most prominent of the flower children ) , Peter Lawford , Groucho Marx ( his comeback performance ? as a self-exiled criminal boss called God with a fiery , bare-backed , black female for an assistant ? is especially disappointing ) , Burgess Meredith , Austin Pendleton , Slim Pickens , George Raft ( as Marx's yacht skipper ! ) , Cesar Romero ( yes , we get three actors from the 1960s BATMAN TV series ? in which Preminger himself featured as Mr . Freeze ! ) and Mickey Rooney ? but , alas , no one's really given all that much to do ! Allegedly , the director experimented with LSD himself in preparation for this film but , unlike the altruistic effect this drug seemed to have on the flower people , it did not alter Preminger's customary tyrannical conduct towards his actors ? including the 78-year old Marx ( who was forced to put on his famous " Groucho " make-up complete with cigar ) ; besides , Faye Dunaway ? who was currently under contract to Preminger ? refused to appear in the film following her triumph in BONNIE AND CLYDE ( 1967 ) and was promptly taken to court by the director ! Furthermore , one must remember that Preminger's very first message movie had been that great anti-drug film , THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM ( 1955 ) and , here , he seemed to be advocating for the wanton consumption of LSD ! ! At any rate , in the very opening sequence of SKIDOO , the director made some kind of a statement about the way feature films are treated when shown on TV ( exemplified by a screening of his own WWII epic , IN HARM'S WAY [ 1965 ] ) ; it's ironic , then , that this viewing of mine came via a pan-and-scan Australian TV broadcast ( complete with frequent ad breaks ? though the actual publicity is , thankfully , omitted ) ! I guess that , apart from watching all those stars making fools of themselves , Nilsson's song score is perhaps the film's other major asset ? though , in a self-satisfied gesture , this includes a song wherein ( literally ) all the credits are sung ? which is not as novel an idea as it might initially appear since Ennio Morricone had previously done it for Pier Paolo Pasolini's HAWKS AND SPARROWS ( 1966 ) ! For what it's worth , the highlight ? if so it can be called ? is an LSD-induced hallucinatory production number entitled " Living in a Garbage Can " which features midgets dancing about in trash cans and , brace yourselves , mooning football players ! Incredibly enough , Bob Dylan ( ! ) had been Preminger's first choice to handle the musical chores on his picture ? which received two viewings from the folk / rock legend at Otto's own mansion before he ( wisely ) declined the assignment ! ! I've purposefully left the storyline well alone since , in the case of a film like this , it's superfluous to dwell much on the details of the plot anyhow : for better or worse , it's an experience every individual viewer has to make his own mind up about ? just for the record , eminent British film critic Leslie Halliwell called it " one of the most woebegone movies ever made " ! Still , in the unlikely event that Paramount decides to grant this notorious turkey a legitimate DVD release some day . . . who knows ? I might be tempted to give it another peek !
576730	1399158	66153	5.0	History Of Postwar Japan As Told By A Bar Hostess ( Shohei Imamura , 1970 )	I was looking forward to following up my small Imamura retrospective with the 3-hour long THE PROFOUND DESIRE OF THE GODS ( 1968 ) , but I had to abort my VHS viewing after the first 10 minutes because the tape was mangled ( which , had I been aware of it , I would certainly have rerecorded the film when it turned up again recently during the " After Hours " programme on Italian TV ) ! In this respect , I have to agree with Michael Elliott's preference of DVD to VHS as one need only turn over the disc to know if it's scratched or not , but with VHS you cannot know beforehand in what state the tape is going to be ! ! So , I had to make do with the next entry in the Imamura canon that I had scheduled to watch . Well , it turned out to be as dreary and unappetizing as the film's very title would suggest , treating as it does events which would mostly only be familiar to Japanese people anyway . As a matter of fact , only the various scenes of military conflict and political turmoil held some measure of interest for me ; indeed , the picture comes off as a very tedious whole , demonstrating that few film-makers can successfully make the leap into the field of documentary ( and , frankly , only Werner Herzog comes to mind at the moment ) .
577546	1399158	61377	5.0	THE ROVER ( Terence Young , 1967 )	Given a very limited distribution ( despite the people involved ) this international production remains , even now , an obscure ( and unappetizing ) historical piece ; not all that much of a surprise , however , since it just isn't very good ? either as drama , adventure , or as an adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel . Director Young was an expert at action ( having pretty much cemented the style of the James Bond extravaganzas ) ; however , this is a largely talky and stodgy affair ? which , perhaps in keeping with the film's very title , doesn't seem to know where it's headed ! Ennio Morricone provides the suitably melancholic music ; the main cast seems impressive on paper but , for the most part , it has very little to work with here ? resulting in generally awkward performances . The titular seafaring character is played by Anthony Quinn ? a veteran of ( much better ) pirate sagas , such as the prime THE BLACK SWAN ( 1942 ) , the vintage AGAINST ALL FLAGS ( 1952 ; with which I should be re-acquainting myself over the next week-end , incidentally ) and the similarly meaningful but more successful A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA ( 1965 ) ? whose exploits , typically for the larger-than-life actor , end in self-sacrifice ( albeit a recurring motif in the author's fatalistic work as well , as can be judged from the likes of " Heart Of Darkness " and " Lord Jim " ) . Rosanna Schiaffino has the most difficult ? and self-conscious ? part as the unstable yet voluptuous woman ( whose odd behavior is eventually explained in a brief flashback ) protected by Quinn from harassment by the locals and the lustful attentions of her ageing ' guardian ' . For an actress who had been the personification of allure and glamour , Rita Hayworth is here saddled with an unenviable frumpy look and , even worse , a thankless characterization ( by the way , she and Quinn had last appeared together 26 years previously in BLOOD AND SAND [ 1941 ] ) ! Richard Johnson's earnest officer , then , supplies belated antagonism to Quinn in the fields of both romance and patriotic duty ( the setting is post-Revolutionary France ) .
576933	1399158	61397	5.0	MOVING TARGET ( Sergio Corbucci , 1967 )	After director Corbucci made his mark with the seminal Spaghetti Western DJANGO ( 1966 ) , he didn't merely restrain himself to that genre ? though his work in the field is surely among the most highly regarded ( incidentally , I'll be delving for the first time into two more such efforts in the coming days ) . For this " Euro-Cult " outing , he changed the typical desert landscape in Almeria for the equally evocative streets and landmarks of Athens ; the film , in fact , is a generally lighthearted foray into contemporary espionage ? however , the results aren't nearly as rewarding as Corbucci's more individualistic ' horse operas ' ! To begin with , the American hero ( Ty Hardin ) is rather bland ? he's a notorious thief who's brought in by plane to serve a sentence in the Greek capital ; however , before he has even had time to put his feet on the ground , Hardin is ' kidnapped ' by Communist spies in order to retrieve a microfilm embedded in one of the teeth of a dead man ! A number of other entities soon reveal themselves to be just as interested in its contents ? including " Albanian " Gordon Mitchell and mysterious British agent Michael Rennie ; the only man the hero can trust is former associate Vittorio Caprioli ? playing a character called Pizza ( ! ) and currently the owner of a sleazy but popular nightclub in town ( with vivacious blonde stripper Graziella Granata as star attraction ) . Another girl is also involved ? Paola Pitagora ? who's introduced as a ' murder victim ' of Hardin's , with which the Communists can then blackmail him into acquiescence ! ; that said , she's an unwilling accomplice ? since the girl's infant nephew ( her deceased sister had been involved with the man in possession of the microfilm ) is being held behind the proverbial Iron Curtain . It's pretty convoluted stuff albeit reasonably engaging while it's on ? with plenty of double-crosses , chases ( especially effective when atypically set against the imposing ruins of the famed Acropolis ) , fistfights , shoot-outs , explosions , and what have you ? even if , in the long run , it emerges as little more than a footnote in the director's career ! The film turns a bit serious during its latter stages as both women are killed off , and Caprioli takes a severe beating from Mitchell and his thugs ; the narrative then concludes with a dual twist ? first revealing the identity of the chief spy , who's subsequently deported , but then we're shown that he has made off with a copy of the prized microfilm ( which , for what it's worth , involved fabricated evidence to incriminate a specific faction for a proposed coup d'etat to be executed by their rivals ! ) after all . The bouncy score by DJANGO , KILL ! ' s Ivan Vandor is notable ? as are the stylish end credits ( a characteristic element of spy sagas from this era ) .
576475	1399158	481797	5.0	YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH ( Francis Ford Coppola , 2007 )	Coppola’s first feature film in a decade was a much-anticipated event : while appropriately ambitious and undeniably intriguing , the end result is too often muddled and distinctly heavy-going ( demonstrating an obsession with philosophy and linguistics ) . The film’s running-time is divided between two interlocking stories : the first involving an old professor’s rejuvenation after being hit by a bolt of lightning ( the condition also unleashes a couple of doppelgangers which , having little real point , only confounds the issue all the more ! ) and the second the reincarnation of an Indian mystic into a girl who also happens to be the double of the learned man’s long-lost love ( the glitch is that , with each lapse into the former personality – regressing into ever more ancient forms of communication – the body of her current vessel ages ! ) . Casting – Tim Roth , Alexandra Maria Lara and Bruno Ganz ( the latter two both from DOWNFALL [ 2006 ] ) – is generally effective ; also making a good impression is Alexandra Pirici appearing as a German seductress / Nazi agent ( it appears that Hitler is interested in exploiting Roth’s predicament towards the proverbial creation of a new master race ! ) , while Matt Damon ( star of the director’s preceding effort , THE RAINMAKER [ 1997 ] ) turns up in a rather trivial cameo . Among the many European locations to which the narrative relocates from time to time is Malta – even if , since the fairly lengthy and important sequence wasn’t filmed over here , Coppola gets much of the geographical detail wrong ! At the end of the day , this is a film that clearly displays a sense of style throughout but which becomes increasingly weighed down by its own thematic pretensions .
577122	1399158	4181	5.0	JUDITH OF BETHULIA ( D . W . Griffith , 1914 )	This was something of a milestone ? denoting a leap for pioneer D . W . Griffith from his customary one or two-reelers to a then considerable length of 49 minutes in this version ( its length may vary on account of differing speeds utilized during projection of Silent movies ) as well as from a modern-day , or at least American , setting towards apparently unlimited scope . In that regard alone , JUDITH OF BETHULIA is worthy of attention ? but Griffith's Victorian sensibilities ( which he could never , or would not , shake off ) still ground it into the antediluvian quality of film-making which is perhaps the most common objection raised by certain viewers nowadays to watching Silent pictures ! Anyway , this was obviously inspired by the Old Testament tale in which a saintly woman sacrifices her dignity in order to release the Jewish people ( depicted as long-bearded stereotypes which would not go down well today ! ) from oppression by the Assyrian army : she ingratiates herself within the affections of King Holofernes , whom she gets drunk one night and decapitates ? after which the invaders disperse . Apart from a lengthy offensive outside the city walls , the running-time is padded-out with the plight of a young couple ( the boy is a brave warrior and the girl eventually enslaved inside the enemy camp ) and , also appearing from time to time , is Lillian Gish in a typical role symbolizing motherhood . Unfortunately , the print I acquired of this 95-year old title was extremely fuzzy ? rendering the elaborate and often chaotic visuals even harder to make out ? and it was accompanied besides by one of the most incongruous scores I have ever heard , approximating to a circus jingle ( complete with laugh track ! ) which one finds at its most jubilant when the on-screen events seem to demand emotions of an entirely different nature ! !
576403	1399158	536826	5.0	Catty On Laughing : And In My Lady's Chamber ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	Typically vulgar and empty-headed latter-day drawing-room TV skit by the " Carry On " team ( included on the R2 Special Edition DVD of CARRY ON MATRON [ 1972 ] ) : following the arrival home of one of the doddering but lecherous master's off-springs , various people ( father , daughter , brother , friend , society hostess neighbor , servants ) engage one night in comic ? yet repetitive and confusing ? bed-hopping antics . If anything , the practiced cast ? including series stalwarts Kenneth Connor , Barbara Windsor , Joan Sims , Jack Douglas and Bernard Bresslaw ? moves the ultra-thin plot along to render this decent episode palatable enough .
577288	1399158	71256	5.0	The Ghost Galleon ( 1974 )	The third entry in " The Blind Dead " series is arguably the weakest : dull , uninvolving and peopled with thoroughly unsympathetic characters who are hard to identify with and , ultimately , care much about . The Knight Templars are , yet again , not the same ' characters ' seen in the previous films , as these here have been punished for their evil deeds to perpetually roam the seven seas in the Ghost Galleon of the title ; also , they seem to have diminished to a handful as opposed to the endless array of Knight Templars from the previous film . The ending , however , is a beauty : having disposed of the Blind Dead into the deep sea , the two surviving characters reach the shore and , supposedly , safety - only to see the Dead rise from the sea and make their way s-l-o-w-l-y but surely towards them ! Some people have seen this film as being a major influence on John Carpenter's infinitely superior THE FOG ( 1980 ) but , to me , those comparisons are tenuous at best .
576036	1399158	82118	5.0	THE BURNING ( Tony Maylam , 1981 )	Opinions vary with respect to this slasher : Leonard Maltin rates it a BOMB , while our own Michael Elliott had awarded it ! Surprisingly , I found myself leaning towards the more favorable rating ? though I wouldn't quite go all the way . It is somewhat better than most of the Friday THE 13TH films ? which it most closely resembles in view of the summer camp backdrop . Unusually , though , we learn that the disfigured maniac at the center of it was always something of a villain ? which certainly doesn't elicit our sympathy for him ! Still , the hero is allowed to get away with having participated in the prank which sent the former off the deep end ( then again , his companions ? who are never seen again after the prologue ? have it way better than him ) ! As for the youngsters , I guess it's a tie : some kids are likable enough , a few of the girls are certainly pretty but there are , of course , the obnoxious egocentrics / show-offs in their midst as well . Unsurprisingly , the latter get their just desserts but , then , so do a number of the others ? with the girls more often than not caught , for our benefit , with their knickers down . The murder weapon utilized most often throughout ? a pair of garden shears ? undoubtedly allows for a number of graphic slayings . Interestingly , then , for the finale , the villain brings out a blowtorch ( intending to give the hero the treatment he got himself , albeit accidentally ) . Needless to say , though , it all ends horribly for the killer ( clad in dark clothes a ' la the typical giallo maniac ! ) ? destined forever to become the subject of camp-fire tales told by the teenagers he hates so much ( is the guy unlucky or what ? ) ! ! Technically , the film ? which , incidentally , proved the Weinstein brothers ' baptism of fire ( no pun intended ! ) ? is nothing special and relies rather too obviously on cheap scares . A definite asset , however , is to be found in Rick Wakeman's electronic score ; Tom Savini's make-up of the villain ? when finally glimpsed ? is quite effective , too .
577652	1399158	66815	5.0	THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR ( James Kelly , 1970 )	This was the first title from Anchor Bay UK's " Tigon Collection " Box Set that I checked out - being already familiar with the higher-profile titles among them , namely WITCHFINDER GENERAL ( 1968 ) and THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW ( 1970 ) . While the film isn't as bad as its reputation would suggest , and is actually well worth watching , it is by no means a classic . The interesting premise classifies it as an anti-war movie but it was deemed to be too talky by executive producer Tony Tenser and , along with some cuts , he ordered the addition of sex and violence inserts to heighten its commercial potential . However , incongruous as they may seem alongside the film's generally deliberate pace , these rapidly-cut scenes of the rampaging ' beast ' work quite well ! The film's mainstay , of course , are committed performances by the two elderly female leads - Beryl Reid and Flora Robson - but also T . P . McKenna as the police official investigating the murders . John Hamill and Tessa Wyatt's contribution - intended to provide the requisite romantic interest - is largely negligible , however . Perhaps the best scene in the film is Reid's lengthy account to McKenna of their family's back-story , disclosing the identity of the ' beast ' and the reason for its violent behavior . One may notice inconsistencies in the lighting scheme throughout ; this is the result of having two separate cameramen - with very different styles - working on the film , albeit both very well regarded exponents of the field ( Harry Waxman and Desmond Dickinson ) . Tony Macaulay's over-emphatic score , however , works against the film's attempt at creating suspense and , ultimately , is what dates it most of all . THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR was actually released as a double-bill with the far superior THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW , which I rewatched later in the week . Director Kelly made only one other film before his untimely death - NIGHT HAIR CHILD ( 1971 ) - which , incidentally , I should also be watching fairly soon since I recently got a copy of it ! The main supplement on the Anchor Bay UK DVD is the Audio Commentary , which is pretty adequate : Tenser's memory isn't so lucid and is occasionally hard to understand , but associate producer Christopher Neame ( son of director Ronald ) made up for this by his highly articulate observations and recollections about this particular film .
576592	1399158	83659	6.0	BLOOD LINK ( Alberto De Martino , 1982 )	This obscure Italian film ? made in the English language ? mixes typical elements of the giallo with a few sci-fi trappings , and adds to them a doppelganger theme . Incidentally , given that it deals with Siamese twins who haven't been in contact for years but are able to ' see ' what one another is doing , it somehow feels like the long-lost sibling of two Brian De Palma films itself ? coming , as it does , in between his SISTERS ( 1973 ) and RAISING CAIN ( 1992 ) ! Anyway , it's mildly interesting ( even more so for me , being a twin myself ! ) , good-looking ( the film was shot in the U . S . and Germany ) and features an understated Ennio Morricone score ? but , in the long run , emerges as nothing especially remarkable . Besides , even if the supporting cast is decked out with veteran presences ? Geraldine Fitzgerald , Virginia McKenna and Cameron Mitchell ? they're all basically wasted ( McKenna , for instance , is already dead within the first 5 minutes ! ) . The lead is played by Michael Moriarty , an actor noted for his intense performances ? and , here , we get double the dose ( with the star , predictably , hamming it up particularly in his serial-killer characterization ) ! However , he's flanked by two lovely ladies whose contribution is above-average for this sort of thing ? Penelope Milford ( ex-Oscar nominee for COMING HOME [ 1978 ] ! ) as the good Moriarty's girlfriend and Sarah Langenfeld ( in one of only 4 films she did ) as the daughter of has-been prizefighter Mitchell , whose cold-blooded murder at the hands of the bad Moriarty she witnesses . By the way , the film features a surprising amount of nudity ( by the two girls and others ) ? but it's not done in an overly sleazy or exploitative manner . The ' face / off ' situations between the two brothers provide the expected fireworks ; the climax , then , sees Milford distracting the villainous ( and impotent ) Moriarty by letting him rape her ? thus enabling the police to track him down through his brother's ability to recognize the surroundings ! This is followed , however , by a far-fetched CARRIE ( 1976 ) - like twist set in the city morgue . . . but which leads to an effectively unsettling ' curtain ' where Milford is literally unable to tell which brother she's ended up with ! P . S . If all goes well , I should be getting to another of De Martino's horror films ? HOLOCAUST 2000 ( 1977 ) ? in the near future , which is one I've missed out on numerous times in the past . . .
576753	1399158	87995	6.0	REPO MAN ( Alex Cox , 1984 )	This is a cult sci-fi comedy that is highly regarded in some circles but one which I never had the opportunity to watch before now ; as usual with such ' modern classic ' fare for me , while I liked it well enough , its uneven tone and general bleakness cause it to fall short of its reputation . A punk kid is reluctantly roped in as a Repo Man , a renegade band of people who repossess unpaid-for cars ; their workforce includes world-weary Harry Dean Stanton , secretary Vonetta McGee and philosophical caretaker Tracey Walter . While there's an admittedly witty script replete with four-letter words , we also get some gratuitous grossness ? such as having Emilio Estevez vomiting ( for no good reason ) after a chase on foot ! Typical of writer-director Cox , the soundtrack is full of rock / punk songs ; appropriately , his next film ? SID AND NANCY ( 1986 ) ? would be a biopic of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his notorious girlfriend Nancy Spungen , which I might just acquire anyway now . The sci-fi elements involve an unseen ' alien ' locked inside the trunk of a car which is chased through the streets of L . A . by two rival bands of Repo Men ? a ' la MOTHER , JUGS AND SPEED ( 1976 ) that I've recently watched ? as well as the C . I . A . The meltdown experienced by anyone coming into contact with the ' alien ' resembles the explosively atomic climax of KISS ME DEADLY ( 1955 ) ? and a further tribute to that noir masterwork is the fact that the end credits here likewise read from down to up ! In any case , the flying finish ? with the now-sizzling car soaring skywards ? was a nice touch .
577366	1399158	56645	6.0	THE VALIANT ( Roy Ward Baker , 1962 )	This was one of a number of Italian WWII-set collaborations with English-speaking countries , a couple of which I watched recently ? namely THE CAPTIVE CITY ( 1962 ) and TORPEDO BAY ( 1963 ) . While the handling is fairly dull , the film's main plot develops into a sustained suspense situation as a British vessel ( commandeered by stiff-upper-lipped John Mills ) is planted with explosive charges by Italian naval officer Ettore Manni and his ( wounded ) companion , who are then imprisoned on the ship itself after refusing to give details of their mission including the whereabouts of the bomb itself . An underwater search at night fails to reap the desired results and Mills ? with the help of officer Robert Shaw ( who's married to an Italian girl ) ? determines to retrieve the necessary information which could save the ship and the life of more than a thousand men on it . Doctor Liam Redmond opposes his treatment of the P . O . W . s , but remains on board to cure the injured man even after the vessel has been evacuated . The explosion eventually occurs early the next morning ? when the ship was scheduled to set sail for war duty ; the film , then , ends with Mills awarding Manni for his integrity and loyalty to his cause three years after the fact . As I said , the film is generally interesting ( like the same director's DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK [ 1952 ] , it's mostly confined to a single setting ) though the interrogation / confrontation scenes do get repetitive ; it's also bogged down by resistible comic relief provided by two marines appointed to guard the saboteurs . P . S . I'd love to revisit Mills ' previous effort with Baker ( in all , they worked six times together ) i . e . the eccentric psychological Western THE SINGER NOT THE SONG ( 1961 ) ? which I acquired some time ago .
576948	1399158	48119	6.0	THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING ( Richard Fleischer , 1955 )	This is a glossy melodrama ( scripted by Charles Brackett , who also produced , and Walter Reisch ) about a famous early 20th century crime of passion . The love triangle comprises Ray Milland ( ideally cast but who isn’t particularly stretched by his role of architect Stanford White ) , Joan Collins ( in one of her better Hollywood parts – by the way , the real-life Evelyn Nesbitt acted in a few Silents herself and served as a consultant on this film ! ) and Farley Granger . The latter is a revelation : usually playing self-effacing types , here he’s arrogant , temperamental and possessive ; he reminded me of Robert Ryan’s equally neurotic millionaire in Max Ophuls’ CAUGHT ( 1949 ) . Besides , Granger’s jealous probing into Collins’ past relations on their wedding night basically replicated a scene from Luis Bunuel’s EL [ 1952 ] ; and , likewise , his murder of the Milland character over Collins presents a similar situation to a subplot in the Pre-Code BABY FACE [ 1933 ] – which , interestingly enough , I watched the very next day ! Fleischer handles the proceedings efficiently enough ( he was certainly adept at real-life crime stories , as his later dramatizations of the lives of other infamous murderers such as Leopold and Leob , Albert De Salvo and John Christie – in COMPULSION [ 1959 ] , THE BOSTON STRANGLER [ 1968 ] and 10 RILLINGTON PLACE [ 1970 ] respectively – can attest ) but , here , he’s somewhat bound by the commercially-minded formula approach of the studio system which , for instance , necessitated the inclusion of corny musical numbers . . . even if Collins’ character does start off as a dancer in a variety act . Unfortunately , too , the courtroom scenes aren’t the most compelling ever put on film – but they’re nonetheless elevated by Luther Adler’s presence as Granger’s defense attorney . Another valued appearance is that of author Cornelia Otis Skinner : this was one of only 4 films she did ( which include the classic ghost story THE UNINVITED [ 1944 ] , also with Milland , and the existentialist drama THE SWIMMER [ 1968 ] , starring Burt Lancaster ) ; she has one interesting scene towards the end where Granger’s mother recounts his overly-protected childhood to Collins , and which inevitably marked his character forever . Collins’ mother , then , is nicely played by veteran character actress Glenda Farrell . While THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING has been a regular on Italian TV over the years , I had first watched it as a kid ; I decided to check the film out again now in view of Fox’s upcoming SE DVD , as part of THE JOAN COLLINS COLLECTION . By the way , the final scene – with Collins doing the titular stage act for impresario Emile Meyer , who’s eager to exploit her new-found notoriety – ends the film on a satisfyingly ironic note .
576192	1399158	66471	6.0	TOO LATE THE HERO ( Robert Aldrich , 1970 )	While I didn't watch this in the most congenial of conditions ( due to lethargy on my part caused by the excessive Summer heat ! ) , it still emerged as something of a disappointment given the enormous talent at hand ! ! Perhaps its greatest fault is that the film is distinctly unmemorable , despite a fairly engaging plot of British troops and one American ( Cliff Robertson ) stranded on a Pacific island at the mercy of the Japanese . The largely British cast looks impressive on paper - Michael Caine , Ian Bannen , Harry Andrews , Denholm Elliott - but few really get a chance to shine : Caine , for instance , seems content most of the time to take a back seat to Robertson . As for Henry Fonda's cameo at the start , he might as well have phoned in his performance ! For all that , the film generates some genuine tension during the second half with its cat-and-mouse game between Robertson and Caine on one side and the Japanese major on the other . This is no jingoistic fare , however , a fact which is borne by the script ( co-written by Aldrich ) and , for this reason , Joseph Biroc's cinematography is deliberately murky - which also means that Gerald Fried's rousing score is actually an ironic comment on the glorification of war ! Curiously enough , the film appears to have a different survivor at the end depending on which version ( British or American ) one happens to catch : since I watched it via the R2 DVD , it's Caine who makes it ; I wonder if the R1 Anchor Bay disc ( now out-of-print ) and the more recent MGM edition are indeed different . . .
577281	1399158	61059	6.0	THE EMBRYO ( Koji Wakamatsu , 1966 )	A mildly interesting if more explicit ( as is to be expected of the Japanese ) variation on William Wyler's THE COLLECTOR ( 1965 ) , the film nevertheless doesn't quite equal the deliriousness of Yasuzo Masumura's similar BLIND BEAST ( 1969 ) : as a matter of fact , the obsessiveness of the relationship at the centre of that film is infinitely more compelling , since the female victim here never seems to grow from the intense experience she goes through and only wants to escape her predicament , without ever striving to understand the motives of her captor ! Indeed , the film's depiction of the aggressor as mother-fixated ( screaming for her even at the moment of death ) is perhaps its only novelty . . .
576756	1399158	34902	6.0	Invisible Agent ( 1942 )	Of the " Invisible Man " series made by Universal , I was only familiar with the first two ( both of which I'll rewatch again presently ) - the James Whale original being one of my all-time favorites . Ever since it was released as part of the " Legacy " set , I had mostly read negative opinions about this film - and even Leonard Maltin gives it a pretty low rating . However , I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it ! True , the leads are rather bland ( why on earth is Ilona Massey credited before Jon Hall ? ! ) but , then , INVISIBLE AGENT has a formidable trio of villains - Peter Lorre , Sir Cedric Hardwicke and J . Edward Bromberg - going for it ( who even make Curt Siodmak's script sound better than it is ) . Besides , I must say that I'm a sucker for both WWII and espionage movies , so that's a big plus as well . . . which , I guess , means that it isn't really a horror film and that The Invisible Man is the hero ! Oh well , you can't have everything ! John P . Fulton's still-impressive special effects ( exposed a bit here by the extra clarity of the DVD transfer ) deliver the goods and , all in all , the film made me keen to get to the remaining titles in the series .
576787	1399158	546	6.0	DREAM OF A RAREBIT FIEND ( Edwin S . Porter , 1906 )	Famous fantasy short with a moral : a man spends a night stuffing himself with food and drink in a restaurant ; stumbling his way home , he sees the buildings ' dancing ' around him and , on arriving , things only get worse . The bed starts to shake violently as if possessed and even throws itself , with the man still tucked in , through the window ( the film's single funniest bit ) ! Flying around town a ' la Scrooge , he's sure to have learnt his lesson by the next morning . As far as I know , the only other Porter film I've watched is THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY ( 1903 ) , celebrated for being the first Western ; this one , then , contains a number of crude camera tricks in the contemporary style of Frenchman Georges Melies . Incidentally ( and Michael Elliott is sure to raise an eyebrow or two at this ! ) , in spite of their undeniable historical value , I can't bring myself to appreciate such primitive stuff other than as mere curiosities ?
576591	1399158	65584	6.0	SAFETY CATCH ( Yves Boisset , 1970 )	Fairly interesting Euro thriller revolving around the investigation into an apparent suicide who , prior to her demise , was involved in a brief romance with a troubled young man but had also attended a dubious photo-model session . The latter scene , which opens the film , features some mild bondage ? thus eliciting memories of Henri-Georges Clouzot's swan-song LA PRISONNIERE ( 1969 ) ; it's also interesting that the girl concerned is played by Raffaella Carra ' ( whose last film appearance this proved to be prior to her breakthrough as a top showgirl / presenter on Italian TV ? a status she holds , by and large , to this day ! ) . Unusual , too , is the fact that the detecting work here doesn't involve the police at all . The initially ambivalent relationship between disgraced doctor Bruno Cremer ( expelled for performing euthanasia ) and self-destructing bourgeois Renaud Verley ( who feels guilty for Carra''s death ) suggests this is going to be a clinical Chabrol-like character study . However , it turns into a conventional thriller before long ( with the heroine ? played by Martine Combrell ? used as bait for the sleazy amateur photographer ) ; still , Mario Adorf manages to invest the latter role with some degree of panache . Jean Martin , best known as the colonel who leads the oppressive French forces in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS ( 1965 ) , appears here as Verley's valet ( who doesn't seem to take kindly to Cremer's intrusion ! ) . As a means of livening up proceedings , director Boisset opts for a car chase climax involving speed-freak Verley and the fleeing ( and flustered ) Adorf . Needless to say , this being a product of the late 60s , we get the added feature of bad dancing in various pub scenes ( though set to some groovy music ) !
577829	1399158	39595	6.0	MAGIC TOWN ( William A . Wellman , 1947 )	Written and produced by frequent Frank Capra collaborator Robert Riskin and starring the director's three-time leading man James Stewart , one would be excused for mistaking this for a film by the celebrated purveyor of socially-conscious comedies . However , while the plot is typically original and engaging , somehow it lacks Capra's unique cinematic expertise in putting over Riskin's ideas : the tone is too often syrupy and sentimental , while the hero isn't made to face formidable villains such as one finds in Capra's work . Even if director Wellman was more at home in outdoor actioners , he often displayed a social side and , for the record , had previously triumphed in two classic films set in contemporary times ? namely the original version of A STAR IS BORN and the screwball comedy NOTHING SACRED ( 1937 ) . Stewart is a poll expert who believes that one city in the U . S . could be deemed the reference point as to how the whole nation thinks and feels about all aspects of life ? its aspirations , trends , political views , etc . His report leads him to settle on the small Midwestern town of Grandview which , however , is on the point of modernizing itself ( via a project bequeathed to local reporter Jane Wyman by her father ) . This would , doubtless , affect the idealized image being promoted by Stewart of Grandview as the prototypical American town with its simple way of life , so he manipulates the populace ( without letting them on to his line of work ) into opposing Wyman's scheme ! This doesn't prevent the two from falling in love ? a romance which ends , though , when she overhears him speaking to his superior in New York ; distraught , she exposes his racket ? but , in so doing , brings a whole circus of ' prospectors ' and newshounds upon Grandview ? so that the next poll turns out to be a disaster , and the town is disgraced ! Stewart is dismayed by all of this ; however , he keeps in touch with the people of Grandview ( the kids especially had learned to look up to him in view of his basketball prowess ! ) and , of course , Wyman . Eventually , he hits upon the idea that a pompous statement made earlier ( but which remained unpublished ) by the highest authorities in Grandview that , if necessary , they'll erect the proposed civic centre with their own hands could be used now to symbolize the town's determination to re-emerge ? An RKO production , the film also features such reliable performers as Ned Sparks and Donald Meek as Stewart's associates , Kent Smith as a Grandview professor and ex-school chum of Stewart's , and Wallace Ford as one of the eminent townspeople .
577628	1399158	65644	6.0	DISPERATAMENTE L'ESTATE SCORSA ( Silvio Amadio , 1970 )	Having recently watched Amadio's lesbian drama ISLAND OF THE SWEDES ( 1969 ) , I checked out another of his films but , alas , it turned out not to be erotic at all ( he also made the giallo AMUCK ! [ 1972 ] with Euro-Cult starlets Barbara Bouchet and Rosalba Neri , and which I may get to fairly soon ) . Still , I found this to be fairly engaging for what it is : the budding romance on a remote island between young Italian widow Paola Pitagora ( accompanied by her son ) and mysterious foreigner Nino Segurini takes a hazardous turn when a couple of sinister-looking men arrive on the scene and it becomes apparent that they've come for Segurini and won't take no for an answer ! The first half is pretty slow and rather uneventful as we're shown in flashback how the couple first met ( they happen to be neighbors ) , the man's friendship with the woman's inquisitive offspring ( who comes to consider the former as a surrogate father and calls him " Uncle " ) and also her slow realization that , in spite of how little she knows about his past , she has fallen in love with him . Eventually , it transpires that Segurini had fled East Germany in possession of a state secret ( for which his sister had already given her life ) ; this we see in another ( rather quaint ) flashback which is presented in monochrome . The latter stages of the film generate some measure of suspense as Segurini attempts to elude his dogged pursuers - with Pitagora and son in between ; in fact , he only gives himself up when they threaten the boy . The woman , however , doesn't stay put and , in a scene which might well have been inspired by a similar one in POINT BLANK ( 1967 ) , she bumps her car repeatedly into that of the Germans just as they're about to board the ship that will take them ( and her lover ) off the island for good . Still , Segurini flees once again and even fakes his own death - but decides to keep away from his loved ones so as not to endanger their lives any longer ! Not a bad film overall , therefore , but it's also true that its raisons d'etre are Pitagora's excellent performance ( I haven't seen her in that many films - but , hopefully , should be adding REVOLVER [ 1973 ] to these fairly soon - recalling above all her turns as a member of the dysfunctional family in FISTS IN THE POCKET [ 1965 ] and as the quietly seductive murderess of SENZA SAPERE NIENTE DI LEI [ 1969 ] ) and an equally fine score by the ever-reliable Riz Ortolani . By the way , the film's long title translates to DESPERATELY LAST SUMMER ; curiously , I couldn't determine whether this was ever released outside Italy - and yet , other than the title itself , all the credits on the print I watched were in English . . . ! !
578137	1399158	43299	6.0	AS YOUNG AS YOU FEEL ( Harmon Jones , 1951 )	Though released on DVD as part of Fox's " Marilyn Monroe Collection " , her role ? playing the spirited , though obviously dumb , secretary at a printing factory headed by Albert Dekker ? is actually very brief . The film is an amusing , Capraesque comedy about 65 year-old printer Monty Woolley who refuses to accept the age imposition which sends him into retirement . The plot involves him impersonating the President of the corporation which owns the factory , paying them an unexpected visit and making a speech in which he retracts the current policy ? thus enabling Woolley the printer to get back his job ! Complications arise when David Wayne ( fiancé of Woolley's niece Jean Peters ) , who also works at the factory , recognizes him ? but also with the attentions given Woolley by Dekker's neglected wife Constance Bennett . The film features a solid supporting cast which includes Allyn Joslyn ( as Woolley's son ) , Thelma Ritter ( as his wife , who's proud of her Brooklyn origins ) , Clinton Sundberg ( as Wayne's ambitious colleague at the plant who could blow Woolley's cover at any moment ) , Minor Watson ( as the real President of the conglomerate ) and a young Russ Tamblyn ( playing Dekker and Bennett's confused son ) . It's a pleasant enough diversion ? adapted by Lamar Trotti from a Paddy Chayefsky ( ! ) story ? given Fox's typically polished ( if fluffy ) treatment .
577146	1399158	536837	6.0	Carry On Laughing : Under The Round Table ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	There's a definite sense of deja'-vu to this Arthurian tale with Kenneth Connor ( Arthur ) , Jack Douglas ( Sir Gay ) , Joan Sims ( Guinevere ) , Peter Butterworth ( Merlin ) and Bernard Bresslaw ( the intrepid yet bumbling knight who ends up getting it on with the Queen ) ; Victor Maddern plays the alcoholic knight Sir Osis Of The Liver ! It's pleasant enough in itself but , as I said , not particularly inventive ; of course , there's a lusty wench on hand to tempt the chaste Bresslaw ? who's also supposed to defend the kingdom from a dragon hiding in a cave ? but , needless to say , things do not go as planned for anybody !
576462	1399158	35489	6.0	THE UNDYING MONSTER ( John Brahm , 1942 )	Along with MAN MADE MONSTER ( 1941 ; also very recently released on DVD ) , this has been my most-wanted horror film of the 1940s for many years ; previously , I only had a huge still of John Howard in full werewolf make-up found in one of my father's film books to whet my appetite ! I was aware that this film is not generally considered to be in the same league as Universal's THE WOLF MAN ( 1941 ) ? with which it was originally intended to compete ? and , in hindsight , I certainly concur with that opinion ? which is a pity because this is a much-better directed film : witness that stunning , long tracking shot at the very beginning with the camera prowling through the Hammond mansion or the first attack seen , via jerky camera movement , from the werewolf's POV ( subsequently much copied not least in the definitive werewolf movie , John Landis ' AN American WEREWOLF IN London [ 1981 ] ) . The cast is quite decent ( if still unspectacular when compared to the star-studded line-up roped in for THE WOLF MAN ! ) : James Ellison ? later of I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE ( 1943 ) ? as the bemused detective hero , John Howard as the troubled current head of the Hammond family , Bramwell Fletcher ? best-known for going mad after witnessing THE MUMMY ( 1932 ) ' s " little walk " and who gives the best performance in this film ? as the mysterious Hammond family doctor , Halliwell Hobbes as the Hammonds ' superstitious butler , Aubrey Mather as Ellison's boss and an uncredited Charles McGraw as the Hammonds ' gamekeeper . The female cast is much less impressive , and Ellison's ditzy partner is a particular liability ! On the other hand , Lucien Ballard's atmospheric black-and-white cinematography is the film's best quality . The werewolf make-up is not bad in itself but , again , falls rather short of Jack Pierce's famous Larry Talbot look ; the script even copies THE WOLF MAN's legendary ditty but in this version , it is a distinctly lame one ! Disappointingly , though , the monster only really comes to prominence in the last ten minutes of the film and is far from being immortal like the title says : in fact , it is briskly dealt with by a couple of close range gunshots from the unusually efficient police force ! The fact that the curse of lycanthropy is passed on from one generation to another not through a bite but rather as punishment for an ancestor of Howard's having sold his soul to the devil is ingenious ? but the potential of this interesting subplot is hampered by the film's own briefness and , consequently , is never treated in any significant way ; similarly , Fletcher's budding romance with Howard's sister is intimated very early on and that's it ? making these people somewhat less than three-dimensional characters .
577635	1399158	74899	6.0	MIDWAY ( Jack Smight , 1976 )	In the vein of THE LONGEST DAY ( 1962 ) and BATTLE OF THE BULGE ( 1965 ) , this one’s basically the equivalent of BATTLE OF Britain ( 1969 ) – as well as a sort of companion piece to TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! ( 1970 ) . For this reason , it tries hard to be as authentic and detailed as possible ( with stock footage of the real WWII battle and constant captions indicating names of places , vehicles and personnel ) but then doesn’t allow much acting opportunity to its star-studded cast : with this in mind , the contribution of James Coburn ( as an officer who mistrusts the information denoting Midway as a probable enemy target ) , Robert Mitchum ( more on his character later ) , Cliff Robertson ( as Heston’s former buddy and superior to his pilot son ) and Robert Wagner ( as Commander Henry Fonda’s aide ) results in being especially negligible . Charlton Heston is the nominal lead : he’s seen having problems with son Edward Albert over the latter’s inopportune relationship with a Japanese girl ( when the latter continues to mope about his personal situation , Heston snaps in his inimitable fashion : " You better shape up , Tiger , or some hotshot Jap pilot's gonna flame your ass ! " ) . Henry Fonda is , as ever , the authoritative figure – playing the Admiral in charge of the defense operation at Midway ; Glenn Ford is Mitchum’s low-ranking replacement ( the latter appears as the well-known Admiral Halsey , who’s been confined to hospital due to a skin disease : apparently , the bulky and notoriously laid-back actor could have chosen to play any real-life character involved but deliberately opted for this thankless role – even so , he lends a welcome dose of humor to the proceedings , especially when he rebukes Ford , who wants to shake Mitchum’s hand for displaying the utmost confidence in him , with " You want us to lose the war ? ! " ) . Hal Holbrook is the enthusiastic old-timer who first detects , through a coded message , the Japs’ intention to attack Midway ; Robert Webber is the Commander of one of the three U . S . cruisers who see action during the famous and decisive battle . Monte Markham is the intelligence officer whom Heston approaches to intervene for the Japanese girl and her parents , who have been detained ; Christopher George is unrecognizable in the cock-pit as one of the leaders of the various flying squadrons involved in the dogfight sequences . Toshiro Mifune and James Shigeta are the most renowned actors on the Japanese side ( one can notice the effort they all did to speak their lines in English ! ) – the country’s defeat at Midway was clearly the result of over-confidence ( brought on by a previous victory , albeit a sneak attack , at Pearl Harbor ) and constant bad judgment on the part of the officers concerned . Incidentally , just for the record , the film features three actors from the cast of THE YAKUZA ( 1974 ) – which I’ve just watched – namely Mitchum , Shigeta and Christina Kokubo ( Albert’s girl ) . The various strategies by which the battle was fought maintain reasonable interest throughout , and the action sequences – which virtually take up the last third of the running-time – are certainly spectacular enough . Hell , even the domestic asides emerge to be less distracting than I had anticipated ( though the same can’t be said of the few scenes from the so-called " TV version " of the film included among the DVD supplements , which introduce the useless character of Heston’s much-younger girlfriend ! ) ; having said that , this added footage does dwell a little on Heston's inability to fly due to a hand injury ( which , of course , has a bearing on his eventual fate ) . In the long run , however , I feel that MIDWAY comes across a bit stiff as entertainment .
577763	1399158	595622	6.0	Hammer House Of Horror : The Thirteenth Reunion ( Peter Sasdy , 1980 ) ( TV )	The second episode in the series is directed by a veteran ( albeit a latter-day recruit ) of Hammer Films . Again , while hardly outstanding , this is a more than adequate effort ? even if , for the most part , the narrative follows a mystery-thriller pattern rather than outright horror . Then again , the studio has had its fair share of films in this style and , in any case , the final revelation is horrific ( if not exactly unpredictable ) ? truth be told , it's more ' shocking ' than most of their now rather quaint films ! The casting is modest but nonetheless effective : Julia Foster overacts somewhat ( particularly when supposed to show bewilderment ) as the reporter heroine covering the goings-on at a newly-established diet clinic , Dinah Sheridan ( best-known for her role in GENEVIEVE [ 1953 ] ) is her newspaper editor , Gerard Kelly the young funeral attendant who alerts Foster to his employers ' extra-curricular activities ( which she discovers have a connection with the clinic ) , and Warren Clarke ( Dim from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE [ 1971 ] ) gets a nice role as an ill-fated patient who befriends Foster but ends up getting the wrong sort of raw deal !
576449	1399158	78919	6.0	BUTCH AND SUNDANCE : THE EARLY DAYS ( Richard Lester , 1979 )	This unnecessary prequel to a seminal western is still fairly enjoyable on its own and the two leads ( Tom Berenger and William Katt ) , then virtually unknown , mimic Paul Newman and Robert Redford , respectively , surprisingly well ; Jeff Corey is even on hand to reprise his role from the earlier film ! Good-looking if forgettable entertainment - and curiously straightforward , given the stylization of the original and the involvement of Richard Lester ( A HARD DAY'S NIGHT [ 1964 ] , PETULIA [ 1968 ] ) who , earlier in the decade , had also directed two rousing adventures , THE THREE MUSKETEERS ( 1973 ) and its sequel , THE FOUR MUSKETEERS ( 1974 ) !
576394	1399158	79082	6.0	THE DRILLER KILLER { Edited Version } ( Abel Ferrara , 1979 )	With this , I've watched 11 films from this director : I can't say I'm a fan , though , because I didn't like many of them ! This , however , is one of his most discussed efforts ? having acquired notoriety due to its being singled out during the UK's " Video Nasties " case of the early 1980s . Ferrara made a couple more horror films ? namely the OK but unnecessary BODY SNATCHERS ( 1993 ) reworking and THE ADDICTION ( 1995 ) , his depressing equation of vampire and junkie ? but this is most certainly the one that leaves the greatest impact . It's far from entirely successful , but its unflinching look at New York low-life is quite unnerving and rivals that seen in TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) ! Interestingly , the director himself plays the protagonist ( under the alias Jimmy Laine ) ? he's a painter frustrated by his heritage ( the first scene has him meeting his bum father in church but failing to acknowledge their connection ) and his surroundings ( he lives in a dingy flat with his bisexual girlfriend and her dazed lover ) . He's further aggravated by the demands of his employer and a punk band's occupation of the apartment underneath ( their scenes are fairly annoying and , given that none of them subsequently figure among the fatalities , this subplot tends to come across as just padding ) . Eventually , the hero snaps and goes out on the streets at night attacking tramps and bystanders with an electric drill ? but this is no mere exploitation flick a ' la THE TOOLBOX MURDERS ( 1978 ) , and it must have confused audiences back in the day expecting just those kind of cheap thrills ! Incidentally , the director's trademark self-indulgence is most evident here in the flashes to his character's nightmare visions and the open-ended finale in which the entire screen unaccountably turns to blood-red . Unfortunately , the R2 DVD I watched was trimmed by 1 minute due to its graphic content ; I don't know whether the confusion felt at the end is smoothed over in the full-length version , particularly with respect to the fate of the lesbian / junkie ' lodger ' . The film , therefore , exudes an undeniable raw power throughout which ? ironically ? could only be possible thanks to its very amateurishness . Interestingly , while I was somewhat let down by a number of cult 1980s horror titles , I find those emanating from the previous decade generally deserving of their reputation ( a ' classic ' I've been postponing for what seems like forever is Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES [ 1977 ] ) ?
576884	1399158	75260	6.0	COP IN BLUE JEANS ( Bruno Corbucci , 1976 )	Surprisingly engaging poliziottesco spoof which actually led to a series , all featuring star Tomas Milian as maverick cop Nico Giraldi ; in fact , a total of 11 films were made between 1976 and 1984 ! I know a few of them turned up on Italian TV as a kid but I had always considered them - and Milian's other contemporaneous series revolving around a character nicknamed " Monnezza " ( Italian slang for " garbage " ) , but which lasted for only 3 ' episodes ' - low-brow , indeed bottom-of-the-barrel , stuff ; considering that their titles - and I'm sure plot lines - were basically interchangeable certainly makes their longevity astounding ! Well , action-packed though it is - with the star ( playing a street-wise ex-delinquent dressed as a bum with a mouse , Serpico , for a pet ! ) going through many a stunt on a motor-bike - the film's most prominent trait is its vulgarity which doesn't merely extend to a proliferation of colorful swearwords ; indeed , the very first scene shows a chubby young man mooning a group of Japanese tourists from across the street , in order to distract them while his accomplices make off with their luggage in a van ! As such , the film is enjoyable in an unassuming way - though the muddy soundtrack and the characters ' frequent resort to the use of dialect made the dialogue a bit of a chore to understand , even for one who's fluent in the language like myself ! - and it's certainly made even more tolerable by the presence of a predictably ruthless Jack Palance ( whose real identity proves quite a revelation ! ) . The finale , then , is at once amusing and clever in that Milian - assigned to a special squad dealing with " snatch & grab " cases , hence the original title SQUADRA ANTISCIPPO - resorts to just such a crime in order to help his lovely girlfriend , whose job it is to smuggle provocative literature into the country ! ; they had met when Milian saved the girl from being raped : keeping her watch and other valuables in her bra , he wonders what she'd say if someone asked her the time , perhaps " a quarter to tits " ? ! P . S . at one point , Milian says " La Polizia Ringrazia " ( The Police Is Thankful ) - which happens to be the title of the 1972 film ( released in the U . S . as EXECUTION SQUAD ) credited with kick-starting the poliziottesco subgenre !
578214	1399158	75299	6.0	HOSPITAL ( Krzysztof Kieslowski , 1976 )	The best of eight shorts I watched in quick succession is this ‘day in the life of a hospital’ film ; it uses the hours of the day as a guide-line for the development of particular situations . The subject is actually pretty grim as various people come in for serious bodily treatment , sometimes parting with a limb in the process : the most excruciating sequence involves a graphic knee-cap operation ( which , however , unexpectedly descends into black comedy as instruments get lodged into the bone-structure or else come apart ! ) ; interestingly , there’s even an investigation into the case of a patient who has thrown herself out of the fourth floor of the building ! At 20 minutes , it’s the longest of the lot – but this actually benefits one’s appreciation of the nonstop goings-on at such an obviously sensitive place .
577432	1399158	40553	6.0	THE LUCK OF THE IRISH ( Henry Koster , 1948 )	Mildly entertaining romantic comedy with a touch of whimsy , rather too slight to live in the memory ? but , nevertheless , worthwhile for Cecil Kellaway's delightful Oscar-nominated performance as a mischievous leprechaun . Newspaperman Tyrone Power is on his way to meet gruff boss Lee J . Cobb ( with a bicarbonate-of-soda bottle never far from reach ! ) , who harbors political ambitions and wants to appoint the hero as his ' ghost writer ' ? even if their views on the matter are on a different wavelength ! Actually , Cobb's daughter ( Jayne Meadows ) , who's also Power's fiancée is the one pulling the strings ; the trouble is that , while passing through Ireland , he falls for inn-keeper's daughter Anne Baxter ? not to mention running into ' cobbler ' Kellaway by a waterfall ( although the residents deny the existence of both man and location ! ) . Back in the States , Power beckons to the will of Cobb ( or rather Meadows ) ; he's even given a plush apartment to live in ? but , when calling for a manservant , it's Kellaway who turns up ! Besides , a chance encounter ? actually ' arranged ' by the genial leprechaun ? with Baxter ( who has come to America for some private family business ) relights his interest , obviously reciprocated , in the girl ; consequently , he begins to neglect his work in order to be with her . Eventually , though , Cobb is ready to appoint Power as editor of his old newspaper if he's elected to the Senate himself ? a position he politely declines ; realizing she's beaten , Meadows gives him up and Power and Baxter are free to return to carefree Ireland . In the last scene , Power ? now married and living at Baxter's father's tavern ? is shown following a local custom ( which he had himself witnessed the old man perform earlier on ) by placing a whiskey bottle outside the tavern door ? which is then said to be picked up by a leprechaun ( and , just as he had done before , the prancing and giggling Kellaway appears soon after to retrieve it ) .
576543	1399158	63634	6.0	SPEEDWAY ( Norman Taurog , 1968 )	This is basically a neat reworking of IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD’S FAIR ( 1963 ) by the same director , no less : Bill Bixby replaces Gary Lockwood as Elvis’ scoundrel sidekick ( and results in being quite amusing ) , Nancy Sinatra stands in for ( and easily upstages ) Joan O’Brien – Ol’ Blue Eyes’ daughter , a singing star in her own right , makes a better-than-usual match for The King – and , instead of one Asian child , we get six homeless kids and their ex-racer father , etc . Besides , the songs are also above-par and rockier than usual and even Sinatra gets her own " impromptu " number . The instances of crazy comedy – usually brought on by Elvis’ frustration with I . R . S . " agent " Sinatra’s doggedness – are also present here and anticipate the next , and last , Presley / Taurog collaboration , LIVE A LITTLE , LOVE A LITTLE ( 1968 ) ; among the highlights are Elvis punching through a hotel-room door and knocking out a passerby and then punching his racing rival in the hotel lobby who consequently slides on his back all the way into an empty elevator ! The racing-car scenes themselves are okay – a milieu with which Elvis was quite familiar , having already played similar roles ( or so I hear ) in both VIVA LAS VEGAS ( 1964 ) and SPINOUT ( 1966 ) .
576758	1399158	48554	6.0	Revenge Of The Creature ( 1955 )	The Creature was the last of the classic Universal monsters I got into , which only happened in 2001 via the original DVD release of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON ( 1954 ) . I loved the film immediately , however , and was very much interested in watching its two sequels - REVENGE OF THE CREATURE and THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US ( 1956 ) . Now that I've caught up with both of them , I'd say that Universal did well enough by this particular monster , and that having arrived so long after the Studio's other notables ( Dracula , Frankenstein , The Mummy , The Invisible Man and The Wolf Man ) proved fortuitous , because The Creature wasn't allowed to become redundant in his own ' starring vehicles ' as was the case certainly - and sadly - with both The Frankenstein Monster and The Mummy . As for the film itself , it isn't up to the original ( with which I should be re-acquainting myself over the week-end ) - despite having the same director . The change in setting is interesting , and it works most of the time ; the main problem , I guess , lies with The Creature's alarmingly limited characteristics : it can only either swim ( in the water ) or go on a rampage ( on land ) - although , to be fair , The Mummy is perhaps even duller ! Still , the film offers reasonable entertainment and the leads are O . K . if , again , failing to match those of the original .
576925	1399158	65026	7.0	THE SPECIALIST ( Sergio Corbucci , 1969 )	Cult film-maker Corbucci's rarest of his thirteen Spaghetti Westerns ( of which I'm only left with WHAT AM I DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [ 1972 ] to catch ) is one I only became aware of fairly recently via Marco Giusti's " Stracult " guide ; it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece , THE GREAT SILENCE ( 1968 ) , complete with desolate snowy landscapes . Johnny Hallyday , the French Elvis Presley , whom I first saw in Jean-Luc Godard's DETECTIVE ( 1985 ) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti-hero Hud ( who , like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from Sergio Leone's celebrated " Dollars Trilogy " , is fitted with a steel-plate armor for protection ) ; incidentally , I had ' met ' Hallyday's stunning daughter Laura Smet at the 2004 Venice Film Festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director , Claude Chabrol ! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold ( serving pretty much the same function that Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE ) but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing Francoise Fabian ; the latter , then , plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals . Sylvie Fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by Hallyday and who , at one point , is entreated into Free Love by ' hippie ' Apache Gabriella Tavernese ( with this is mind , it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese ) ! Incidentally , the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths ( who also engage in dope-smoking and revolutionary talk ) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance ? but it all eventually adds to the fun ( besides , even the black barmaid sports an Afro hairdo ! ) . Mario Adorf , too , enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a larger-than-life Mexican bandit nicknamed " El Diablo " ? who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side ( an element which may have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [ 1992 ] ) and , at one point , challenges the captive Moschin to a head-butting duel ! Having mentioned this , the film also contains one very unusual ' weapon of death ' ? as Hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash-register of the saloon into his face ! As always , the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over-emphatic sound effects ; equally typically for the genre , however , the wistful score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino emerges a most significant asset . Actually , the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone ? after Fabian's comeuppance at the hands of the locals , the hippies ( who had previously idolized Hud ) suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town ( forcing everyone on the street and unclothed ) ? but the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge ( they , however , scurry away at the prospect of facing him ! ) and then rides out of town , leaving Fennec behind . In conclusion , I acquired this via a good-quality Widescreen print in Italian albeit with French credits and the occasional lapse ? about one minute of screen-time in all ? into the French language ( where , apparently , the original soundtrack wasn't available ) .
576388	1399158	78129	7.0	QUATERMASS ( TV ) { Episodes 1-4 } ( Piers Haggard , 1979 )	I viewed this as part of a two-film retrospective of John Mills titles ( the other being THE SINGER NOT THE SONG [ 1961 ] ) to commemorate the centenary of his birth on the 22nd of February . Incidentally , I'd purchased the R4 DVD edition ? and two other Nigel Kneale-scripted made-for-TV efforts , THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS ( 1968 ) and BEASTS ( 1976 ) ? following the death last year of that noted sci-fi literary figure , one of my favorite exponents of the genre , but hadn't yet gotten around to watching it until now ! Of course , this is the fourth ( and last ) of Kneale's serials revolving around Professor Bernard Quatermass ? submitting yet another scary ( but totally persuasive ) scenario to challenge our established notions of humanity , the world and beyond . Interestingly , the protagonist was played by a different actor each time : here , Mills turns in a typically excellent ( albeit low-key ) performance . However , the muddled apocalyptic plot ? in which space missions go horribly wrong , Britain is reduced to a wasteland , a mass of fanatical but deluded youth is " harvested " ( read exterminated ) , senior citizens are forced to literally live underground , etc . ? is somehow insufficient for the film's 200-minute length ; this eventually gives rise to a fair bit of repetitiveness throughout ( particularly with respect to the gibberish chants of the Planet People ) . The serial does culminate in an intense and moving finale in which Quatermass meets up with his missing granddaughter , who has joined the ranks of the Planet People , just as he's set to fire a nuclear missile at the death ray from outer space ; about to perish himself ( from a heart attack ! ) , it's she who guides his movements in saving the world . One of the definite assets here is the effectively moody synthesizer score ; besides , the supporting cast is led by Simon MacCorkindale ( from JAWS 3-D [ 1983 ] and the MANIMAL [ 1983 ] TV series ) ? who's good in his role of the young scientist aiding Quatermass understand the extraterrestrial phenomenon ; a histrionic Barbara Kellerman appears as his wife , who soon falls victim to the devastation ; Margaret Tyzack ( 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY [ 1968 ] ) , Brenda Fricker ( future Oscar winner for MY LEFT FOOT [ 1989 ] ) and actress / rocker Toyah Willcox also appear . While not up to Kneale's earlier QUATERMASS scripts in the long run , this is still quite good ? with the 20-year gap since that character's last TV appearance enabling a far smoother production . In fact , there was no need to adapt it for the cinema as Hammer had done with the first three ; rather , the serial was probably made with this in mind ( director Haggard had made another cult-based supernatural horror piece ? THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [ 1971 ] ) and subsequently got reduced to about half its length for theatrical exhibition . Originally shot in Panavision , the four episodes are however presented here open-matte so as to preserve the standard TV format ; the Australian 3-Disc Set I purchased , then , thoughtfully includes both versions .
577818	1399158	56350	7.0	THE PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER ( John Gilling , 1962 )	I'd been wanting to check this one out ever since coming across a poster of it , as a double-bill with MYSTERIOUS ISLAND ( 1961 ) , amongst a whole bunch of old newspaper cuttings of local releases from the 1950s and 1960s which my father used to collect and glue in scrapbook form in his teenage years ! It's never been shown on TV in my neck of the woods , so I had to wait until now to watch the film ? and it didn't disappoint : a familiar but undeniably vivid , indeed vigorous , action-packed adventure with no ounce of fat during its 87-minute length ? yet containing the expected Hammer touches of nastiness , particularly with its notorious piranha sequences ( which is the reason why the river of the title is so named ! ) . Casting is terrific all round : Kerwin Mathews ( at his best in such surroundings ) is a believable hero ; Christopher Lee looks great with an eye-patch and even affects a more-or-less authentic French accent ; his pirate entourage , then , includes the likes of Peter Arne , Oliver Reed and Michael Ripper ( though his quaint pirate lingo begins to grate after a while ) ; among the locals are Glenn Corbett , FIRST MAN INTO SPACE ( 1959 ) ' s Marla Landi ( as Mathews ' sister and over whom Arne and Reed engage in a duel blindfolded ! ) , and Andrew Keir ( as the hero's stern father but who ultimately sacrifices himself for the good of the community ) . Incidentally , considering the piracy theme , one of the oddest aspects about this particular film is that the action takes place entirely on land ! When we first see Lee and company , they ' save ' the life of Mathews ? who's just escaped from a penal colony ( to which his own father had sentenced him after being caught red-handed in an adulterous liaison and whose partner ended up food for the killerfish ! ) . They decide to accompany him to his people's settlement ? fugitive Huguenots who have established themselves in England ? because Lee believes them to be in possession of a fortune ( even if Mathews himself tells the pirates there's no such thing ) . Soon , the buccaneers take over the village and start to exterminate the citizens ( in twos ) for the length of time that the location of the treasure isn't divulged ! ; eventually , Mathews is told it does exist and that , as community leader , his father is the only one who might be aware of the actual ' site ' ? so he pleads with him to give up the gold for the sake of the people ? but the old man is still cross with his son and refuses ! The sly Lee , observing the scene from afar , concludes that the plunder may be hidden behind the statue of the community's founder ? which he orders his men to pull down , only to reveal nothing ; however , Mathews insists and decides to scrape off the paint on the statue , which turns out to be made of solid gold ! After this , the pirates are ready to leave but they take both Mathews and Keir for insurance ? especially since a small group of townsfolk , led by Corbett , have fled their control and are organizing raids against them and laying booby-traps in their path ! Finally , the two bands meet head-on by the river ( where the pirates have built a raft to transport both the loot and their own ever diminishing number ) ; incidentally , the buccaneers themselves rise against their leader ? an opposition led by former lackey Ripper , whom Lee had earlier slighted . In any case , as is typical of such films , the prime members of each group are made to face off ? so that we get Arne fighting Corbett and Lee dueling with Mathews ? and , as always , however inexperienced , good triumphs over evil ( though , in the meantime , as I said earlier , the burly Keir throws himself into the river to demolish the raft ? before both he and the pirates on board once more attract the attention of the piranhas ) . From what I've read since this film's DVD release as part of Columbia / Hammer's " Icons Of Adventure " set , it seems to be the one getting the least consideration ; I beg to differ and find it perhaps the most purely enjoyable of the lot ? if , for nothing else , due to the stalwart cast but also the sure-fire elements of hidden loot and underwater menace . Finally , it's worth noting that co-writer / director Gilling ( here working from a Jimmy Sangster story which he would himself rehash into another Hammer / Lee / Ripper adventure outing , THE DEVIL-SHIP PIRATES [ 1964 ] , conveniently also included on the Columbia set and which I actually watched soon after ! ) made quite a few films in similar vein : THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE ( 1959 ) with Victor Mature ; FURY AT SMUGGLERS ' BAY ( 1961 ) , a non-Hammer effort with Peter Cushing ; and , for the famed horror company , THE SCARLET BLADE ( 1963 ) and THE BRIGAND OF KANDAHAR ( 1965 ) ? both with Oliver Reed . For the record , out of all of these , only the Cushing title is available on DVD and a Region 2 exclusive at that !
577094	1399158	26123	7.0	The Black Room ( 1935 )	Another film I had been reading about since childhood but up till now have had no opportunity to watch . An interesting star vehicle for Boris Karloff allowing him to play two roles as contrasting twins ; the fact that one of them is deformed may owe something to Lon Chaney and here Karloff demonstrates himself a most worthy successor to the Master's mantle . The period setting - its-folk-tale quality hearkens back to German Expressionism - serves the handsome production extremely well , especially when considering that Columbia Pictures at the time was just starting to pose a serious challenge ( following the Oscar sweep of Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT [ 1934 ] ) to the major studios . Director Roy William Neill handles the proceedings with great efficiency and style providing plenty of visual flourishes along the way . The only criticism one can level at the film regards a couple of slightly contrived plot points : the evil Karloff , who has done away with his benign but paralyzed sibling and whom he impersonates in order to win the girl he loves , is rather stupidly caught by the girl's father when he is spotted in a mirror using his ' lame ' hand to sign the marriage contract ; Karloff's come-uppance is brought about by his dead brother's faithful mastiff which hates his guts - it's implausible to think that the dog has kept away from Karloff for days ( by which time the girl's lover has been convicted for her father's murder ) only to conveniently reappear on his wedding day ! However , the ironic climax - which allows the prophecy tied with Karloff's family name to be fulfilled - is a splendid one . All in all , along with THE MASK OF FU MANCHU ( 1932 ) and THE WALKING DEAD ( 1936 ; see below ) , THE BLACK ROOM is Karloff's best vehicle of the 1930s which wasn't produced by the studio which made his name , Universal .
576497	1399158	66301	7.0	RIO LOBO ( Howard Hawks , 1970 )	While hardly the most auspicious of swan songs , Hawks’ underrated final film sees a reprise of some of his favorite themes – including the siege / hostage exchange situation from RIO BRAVO ( 1959 ) , a Western he had already partially remade as EL DORADO ( 1966 ) ; incidentally , John Wayne starred in all three titles . It opens with an elaborate gold shipment robbery from a moving train by Confederate soldiers ; Wayne is a Unionist Colonel who goes after the culprits but , the war over , befriends ‘enemies’ Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum when they reveal the identity of a couple of Yankee traitors – one is a deputy sheriff and the other an unscrupulous landowner ( Victor French ) . The film shares its partnership - between - Union - and - Confederate - soldiers angle with Wayne’s earlier Western THE UNDEFEATED ( 1969 ) – but , Hawks being Hawks , it’s presented here in a far more complex ( and rewarding ) manner . As is usual for the director , a spirited female protagonist is thrown into the fray – in this case , Jennifer O’Neill as a traveling-show performer who falls foul of French and his dastardly sheriff ( Mike Henry ) ; of course , she becomes romantically involved with Rivero – a situation Wayne observes with bemusement . Jack Elam is a delight as Mitchum’s trigger-happy coot of a foster parent , making him an ideal replacement for the Walter Brennan of RIO BRAVO . The film also features an unusually wistful score for a genre effort courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith . All things considered , however , RIO LOBO still emerges as the least of the loose Wayne / Hawks Western trilogy : this is chiefly due to severe undercasting when compared to the earlier efforts – with , say , Rivero being no match for James Caan from EL DORADO . Though a lot of exposition is necessary for the various plot threads to fall into place , the film ( co-scripted by Hawks regular Leigh Brackett ) provides plenty of action throughout its almost 2-hour length . The climax is exciting and well-staged , and includes the revenge on Henry by a young girl he has viciously scarred for life ( played by Sherry Lansing , future head of the Fox and Paramount studios and currently Mrs . William Friedkin ) – which , however , calls for O’Neill to be virtually absent from these final stages and the film to end abruptly ( albeit on a running joke involving Wayne ) ! Unfortunately , too , the DivX copy I watched proved rather hazy and suffered from occasional compression artifacts .
576468	1399158	70622	7.0	SSSSSSS ( Bernard L . Kowalski , 1973 )	Well , talk of an omen ! In my review of BUG ( 1975 ) , I had written that I didn't have the courage to watch this title because of my fear of snakes ; a mere 2 days later , I learned of its director's recent passing ? so , I said to myself , slimy critters be damned ? now's the time to check out this bugger ! ! From Kowalski's work , I was familiar with the cheap sci-fi / horror ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES ( 1959 ) and the adventure disaster about a volcanic eruption KRAKATOA , EAST OF JAVA ( 1969 ) ? hardly notable fare , I know , but Leonard Maltin did award SSSSSSS a respectable ? which I found to be well-deserved ! The film ? produced by Richard D . Zanuck and David Brown , who subsequently scored a big hit for Universal with JAWS ( 1975 ) ? is really a slick update of his previous genre work , and possibly the loopiest concept yet conceived within the resurrected " Nature Gone Wild " cycle . That said , it's quite reminiscent of both THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE ( 1959 ) and Hammer Films ' THE REPTILE ( 1966 ) ? while Jack Cardiff's THE MUTATIONS aka THE FREAKMAKER ( 1974 ; which I've yet to watch despite being available as a SE DVD ) , in which Donald Pleasence transforms people into plants , seems to be at least as nonsensical ! Well , as it turned out , there's sure plenty of snake footage here ? but it only became genuinely skin-crawling when filmed in close-up . Besides , I never thought I'd say this but I actually came to like Strother Martin's pet snake Harry ( with its fragile squeak , as opposed to the reptile's typical aggressive hiss , and penchant for alcohol ? " Look sober , Harry ! " , advises Martin as disapproving daughter Heather Menzies arrives home ) and felt sorry when it was killed . What I especially enjoyed about the script ( which maintains a reasonable balance between educational overview on the common misconceptions relating to the subject matter and providing the vicarious thrills dictated by its B-movie roots ) are the little , almost casual moments which eventually pay off in a big way . These include : the opening scene involving a mysterious container , and the later revelation of its carrier as a carnival-show proprietor ; the lecture given by the Professor about the subtle difference between two particular species of snake , and the quandary he finds himself in when a prisoner in Martin's basement ; the isolation of a sick python , which eventually gets the better of the afore-mentioned Professor ; Dirk Benedict drawing Heather Menzies ' attention to the carnival Snake Boy's blue eyes ( remarked upon again by a postal worker from town ) , which alerts her to the fate of Martin's former assistant ; Benedict's contention over Menzies ' grief at her favorite pet's demise ? " Harry was just a snake ! " ? which , of course , takes new and ironic meaning when he starts turning into one himself ; also , Martin's taking a rather unwise condescending attitude towards the cobra throughout ? which , inevitably , sets up his painful come-uppance at the end . Martin is brilliantly cast : benign-looking yet utterly chilling when he's spouting the requisite mad doctor credo ( by quoting the passage by Walt Whitman which also found its way in the contemporaneous THE WICKER MAN [ 1973 ] ? though , in its case , available only in the " Extended Version " ) . Well , I have to hand it to all the actors here in showing this much commitment to their craft : it takes guts to act ? and , with respect to Martin , sustain the necessary concentration to deliver quality work ? around a plethora of deadly snakes ( reportedly , Martin got bit for his troubles ) ! Incidentally , the actor showed a surprising branching-out into horror roles during this period ? THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan ( 1971 ; which I own on DVD and is an even superior effort ) came prior to SSSSSSS , while NIGHTWING ( 1979 ; with which I'm unfamiliar , but it doesn't seem to be readily available for appraisal ) followed later on in the decade . Benedict is pretty bland at first , but his emotional breakdown ? as the snake genes begin to take over his body ? is reasonably convincing ; true , it's kind of dumb of him to take so long to realize just what's really going on with his frequent inoculations ? but , then , who could have truthfully conceived of Martin's demented plan ? ! Curiously enough , a later role for the actor ? in the episode THE MARK OF THE DEVIL from the TV series HAMMER HOUSE OF MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE ( 1984 ) ? also saw him devastated by an unexpected physical change . The subplot in the film involving Benedict's bullying by a brash and strapping fellow student ( the University's champion football player ) is dispensable as such , but the nature of his demise leads to a welcome element of black comedy ? when his over-sexed girlfriend reports to the police that she may have been responsible for his fatal heart attack ! Menzies is a likable female lead , and would eventually appear in another well-regarded genre effort ? PIRANHA ( 1978 ) . However , she's also involved in a nude bathing scene with Benedict which is so contrived and chaste as to be quite redundant ( though the script does manage to squeeze in a joke here at the expense of her character's myopia ) . The film , then , concludes abruptly on a freeze-frame of her screaming as she witnesses Benedict-as-cobra fighting a mongoose . John Chambers ' make-up is remarkably effective in detailing the various stages of Benedict's ' affliction ' ( as well as the botched Snake Boy ) ; however , it was disappointing that the metamorphosis from man into snake is so complete ( the finalization process itself was pretty silly ) ? to the point where one can't tell the two cobras apart ! It's unclear whether the character was subsequently intended to revert back into human form , as was the case with THE REPTILE ? where the monster was actually a hybrid . Equally notable here is a very good , unsettling score by Pat Williams .
577404	1399158	61389	7.0	BEACH RED ( Cornel Wilde , 1967 )	This one emerges as Cornel Wilde’s second-best directorial effort after THE NAKED PREY ( 1966 ; still bafflingly M . I . A . on DVD ) . It’s an unflinching depiction of warfare – with a surprising amount of gore for the time , punctuated by touches of dark humor – which must have influenced Steven Spielberg’s SAVING PRIVATE RYAN ( 1998 ) , even down to having the first third of it consisting of one seemingly endless battle . The film , however , also anticipates Terrence Malick’s THE THIN RED LINE ( 1998 ) by 30 years in its pre-occupation with the soldiers’ domestic lives ( via multi-character narration and flashbacks ) – but , commendably , takes care to show that of the enemy as well . Plot-wise , it doesn’t really lead anywhere ; then again , that’s probably in order to show the futility of war itself and often resorts to creative i . e . showy , but now dated , Oscar-nominated editing to make its points . There’s also the occasional symbolism – for instance , a crushed beetle standing in for the decimation of untrained U . S . troops at the hands of the wily Japanese ( at one point , disguising themselves en masse in American uniforms ! ) . Featuring a largely anonymous cast , the film tries to be contemporary by focusing on the exploits of two youthful soldiers – their sexual hang-ups and fear of dying . The only familiar names are Wilde himself ( as the platoon leader – appropriately war-weary yet staunchly dedicated to his men ) , Rip Torn ( as his tough-as-nails lieutenant ) and " guest star " Jean Wallace ( Wilde’s real-life spouse playing his on-screen wife as well in a few flashback instances and singing the film’s melancholy title song ) . Torn’s bloodthirsty character personifies the dehumanizing effect of war throughout the film : in the long run , cynicism gets the upper hand – brushing away even a poignant plea for tolerance at the finale !
577161	1399158	39344	7.0	DEDEE D ' ANVERS ( Yves Allegret , 1948 )	This was a contender for the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion ? facing such stiff competitors as THE FALLEN IDOL , David Lean's OLIVER TWIST , THE RED SHOES , THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and the eventual winner , Laurence Olivier's HAMLET . Incidentally , leading lady Simone Signoret and director Allegret were husband and wife at the time of shooting , but they divorced the following year . On the surface , the film does feel suspiciously like an inferior rehash of Marcel Carne's PORT OF SHADOWS ( 1938 ) ? not just its harbor setting and noir-ish ambiance , but the characterizations themselves : with Signoret neatly replacing Michele Morgan , Italian writer - turned - director - and - actor Marcello Pagliero ( he starred in Roberto Rossellini's ROME , OPEN CITY [ 1945 ] and later directed the similarly-titled ROMA , CITTA ' LIBERA [ 1946 ] ) instead of Jean Gabin , Bernard Blier standing in for Michel Simon , and Marcel Dalio essaying the role of the cowardly crook portrayed by Pierre Brasseur in the earlier film ! Even so , the four leads are all excellent in their respective roles : Signoret , especially , has a star-making turn as the optimistic bar hostess / streetwalker and Dalio is deliciously slimy as her wimpish pimp who is not above beating her to get the girl to extort more money from her clients , which he then squanders on his infallibly doomed schemes . The film is very well done in all departments ( an unexpected highlight is a brutal street scuffle early on , not to mention the vicious ending ) and makes one look forward to eventually sampling Allegret's other well-regarded efforts ? UNE SI JOLIE PETITE PLAGE ( 1949 ) , MANEGES ( 1950 ; also with Signoret and Blier , which I have on VHS but only in French ) and THE PROUD AND THE BEAUTIFUL ( 1953 ) . Ultimately , DEDEE D ' ANVERS has the disadvantage of being sort of stuck in the middle between two superior movies on a similar theme ? the afore-mentioned PORT OF SHADOWS and Jacques Becker's CASQUE D'OR ( 1952 ; also starring Signoret ) . While one has to be grateful to Italian TV channels for the loyalty they show towards French cinema in the way they keep pumping them out throughout their daily schedules , I have to complain about the dire state of the print quality on evidence here : the video is hazy in the extreme and is saddled besides with a tagged-on , anachronistically modernistic soundtrack !
576546	1399158	17918	7.0	THE GAUCHO ( F . Richard Jones , 1927 )	Unusual but beautifully made and typically enjoyable Douglas Fairbanks vehicle , which finds the star at his most roguish ( while still being his dashing and athletic self ) ; with the Argentine pampas for backdrop , the film ? whose full official title is DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS AS THE GAUCHO ? can be considered a semi-Western . The narrative encompasses romance ( supplied by fiery Lupe Velez ) , religion ( via the presence of a miraculous shrine overseen by a saintly shepherdess ? we even get a couple of visions of the Madonna herself , played by Fairbanks ' own equally popular actress wife , Mary Pickford ! ) as well as more characteristic action ( in the form of The Gaucho's opposition to the rule of tyrannical Gustav von Seyffertitz ) . A subplot which ties in with the element of faith sees the hero being deliberately contaminated by a carrier of " The Black Doom " whom he had previously slighted , though both are eventually cured . Fairbanks ' trademark pioneering spirit in the technical department is also well in evidence here ? with matte paintings giving the illusion of a truly elaborate visual design , reversed film for one particularly showy leap by the star onto his faithful steed , and even the wholesale horse-driven transportation of a house at one point !
577075	1399158	65375	7.0	THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD ( Jerzy Skolimowski , 1970 )	I was pleasantly surprised by this one : Leonard Maltin rates it a BOMB but I found it great fun , if uneven . Skolimowski's first English-language film was actually shot in Cinecitta ' and , in fact , features many Italians in the cast ( all of whom struggle with the literary - and very English - nature of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original ! ) . There's still plenty of amusing detail to savor - the subject matter of the Napoleonic Wars is treated as farce most of the time and , in fact , there's quite a bit of slapstick involved ( to which Skolimowski's technique is happy to oblige via numerous camera tricks , pretty much the sole link here to his early Polish films ) - and , accordingly , all the performances are broadly delineated : Peter McEnery is a pompous yet likable ne'er-do-well hero ; Eli Wallach is a buffoonish ( and gay ) Napoleon ; while Jack Hawkins has a whale of a time ( which , alas , happened very seldom in the films he made following the tragic loss of his voice ) as the flustered leader of a bandit rabble who have adopted novel means of torture and execution , and are even dressed in Klan-type garb ! Apart from asides to the audience , McEnery also engages in a constantly interrupted duel with British officer Mark Burns - with whom he also spars for the affections of beautiful and fiery Spanish countess Claudia Cardinale . John Neville is the Duke of Wellington in his last film for almost 20 years ( when he achieved some latter-day notoriety , in another tongue-in-cheek fantasia no less , with the title role of Terry Gilliam's THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN [ 1988 ] ) . Riz Ortolani contributes a suitably jaunty , yet frequently rousing , score . Unfortunately , some of the film's visual impact was inevitably lost in the pan-and-scan version I watched ( taped off Cable TV ) ; originally shot in Panavision , I wouldn't mind owning this in its proper Aspect Ratio on DVD . . .
577431	1399158	43668	7.0	I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU ( Roy Ward Baker , 1951 )	I'd been looking forward to this one , in view of its time-travel / reincarnation theme ( released as part of a 10-movie set of minor Tyrone Power vehicles , I had opted to acquire it through ulterior sources ? though I may still get my hands on some of the other titles ) . Still , I was surprised by how well this implausible yet fascinating theme is handled here ? surely making for one of the star's most underrated ( and unusual ) efforts . Made in Britain , the film was based on John L . Balderston's romantic fantasy play " Berkeley Square " ( the literate adaptation here is by Ranald MacDougall ) ? already brought to the screen in 1933 under that name ( while the original title of this one is actually THE HOUSE IN THE SQUARE ) ; the first version is virtually impossible to see nowadays , though it did land Leslie Howard an Oscar nomination ? the ultimate irony , given that the transcendental narrative essentially bestows its protagonist with immortality , is that an untimely demise was in store for the leading man of both cinematic renditions ! Anyway , Power is an American scientist working in England ( the initial radiation experiment is intriguing but superfluous and misleading under the circumstances ) who lives in a house belonging to an ancestor of his and who conveniently looked just like him . Finding the latter's diary , he learns that he had been persecuted for his strange beliefs and practices and was eventually locked up in an insane asylum ? he becomes convinced that , by some quirk of nature , the two had actually exchanged places and , soon enough , he's hit by a bolt of lightning and wakes up in 1784 ! He meets the family of his forebear including the latter's future wife ( Beatrice Campbell ) ; thanks to letters which had been preserved and that he had read , Power's initially able to comfortably fill his shoes ? however , he then meets and falls for Ann Blyth , Campbell's sister and of whom he was unaware ! Soon , the hero begins to commit other gaffes by which he demonstrates to be perceptive of things that hadn't yet occurred or , at least , weren't common knowledge ( from the gift of a shawl for Campbell which Blyth hadn't even unpacked , the secret and subsequently famous portrait of a Duchess ? played by Kathleen Byron ? by the painter Gainsborough , delivering the lady's own obituary at a ball , not to mention ' feeding ' Dr . Johnson with some of his own celebrated epigrams [ ! ] , etc ) . This doesn't sit at all well with either Campbell ( who's unwilling to keep up her engagement to Power , not least because of his constant attentions for her sister ) or the vindictive Raymond Huntley ( Blyth's much older suitor ) . The hero , finding himself increasingly out-of-touch with the times , retires to a basement in a poor quarter of town to ' recreate ' future inventions such as the light bulb and the model of a steam-ship ; when these are discovered , they're branded the handiwork of a sorcerer by eminent scientist Felix Aylmer ? the place is destroyed there and then , while Power is on his way to perpetual confinement in Bedlam ! Other notable cast members are Dennis Price ( playing an amiable rake , as was his fashion during this time ? the relentless and rather effeminate pursuit of etiquette by the aristocrats , in fact , is just about the sole blemish on the picture ) and Michael Rennie ( as Power's pragmatic scientist associate in the modern-day sequences ) . Incidentally , the film utilizes moody black-and-white cinematography for these bookends ? while soft but attractive color is employed throughout the central ' fantasy ' section ; both are courtesy of Georges Perinal , a top French cameraman resident in Britain for over thirty years . Similarly , Power effectively tackles both facets of his character : the film , ultimately , can be read as both a morality play ( the hero's decision to tempt Fate which , as often happens , subsequently threatens to unbalance the order of the things ) and a celebration of that well-worn Surrealist concept ? l ' amour fou ? in his relationship with a radiant Blyth ( herself playing a dual role , the second as Rennie's sister who had cared for the Power's even more bewildered ancestor in his unseen tenure in the 20th century ) . Given my appreciation for THE HOUSE IN THE SQUARE ( the title I'm partial to myself ) , I'm all the more interested now in one day catching the original version . Finally , this was one of British director Baker ( a future horror regular ) ' s brief four-movie brush with Hollywood ? I'd already watched DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK ( 1952 ; which I also own ) and INFERNO ( 1953 ) , but not the minor noir NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP ( 1952 ) .
577293	1399158	39211	7.0	Born To Kill ( 1947 )	This is a pretty tough and cynical film to come from the typically tasteful Robert Wise : an exemplary noir with both Claire Trevor and the indomitable Lawrence Tierney at their very best ; BORN TO KILL also offers memorable roles to such sterling character actors as Walter Slezak , Elisha Cook Jr . , and ( especially ) Esther Howard . The film was intended to put leading man Tierney into the Hollywood big league but , ultimately , his erratic and violent behavior off-screen put those plans to rest ; he still managed to work steadily over the years , eventually becoming an iconic figure which undoubtedly led to his landing a pivotal role in Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS ( 1992 ) . The Audio Commentary on Warners ' DVD offers some hilarious anecdotes about Tierney's off-screen antics , even in his old age : at a 1999 screening of the film at Grauman's Egyptian Theater , among other things , he verbally berated director Wise ( who was the guest of honor ) for claiming " authoriship " of the film . It's a pity that when I was there ( on numerous occasions ) a few weeks ago , nothing quite as colorful took place ! Unfortunately , my disc seems to be incompatible with my Pioneer DVD player as it pixilated like crazy when I inserted it ; however , it played without a glitch on my computer's DVD-ROM ! !
577359	1399158	65421	7.0	THE ARISTOCATS ( Wolfgang Reitherman , 1970 )	Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself ( he died in late 1966 ) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output . The main problem is that , on the surface , the film seems merely to be the feline version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP ( 1955 ) or 101 DALMATIONS ( 1961 ) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans Even so , being both an animation and cat lover , I dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat ( voiced by Eva Gabor ) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady ( Hermione Baddeley ) ' s greedy butler . Luckily , they meet a streetwise alley cat ( Phil Harris ) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band ( led by Scatman Crothers ) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs ; meanwhile at home , Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets . Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song ( which includes a verse in French ) and Scatman's band indulge in a breezy number " Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat " .
577373	1399158	26494	7.0	HORSES ' COLLARS ( Clyde Bruckman , 1935 )	This is another wonderful Three Stooges short , despite the meaningless title . Here , the boys are Pinkerton detectives sent out West to help an innocent girl being bullied by a ruffian – a premise which actually anticipates Laurel & Hardy’s classic WAY OUT WEST ( 1937 ) , and even includes a similar scene in which The Stooges attempt to retrieve an important document from the villain’s safe ! Gags include the boys playing tough guys at the saloon – where they inadvertently set the sheepskin trousers of the baddie’s henchman on fire – and taking to the dance-floor in a ruse to get at the piece of paper jealously guarded by the heavy inside his wallet . Still , the best moments of the film involve Curley going into a raging fit – a similar affliction to the one he had in PUNCH DRUNKS ( 1934 ) – at the sight of a mouse ( asked why , Moe replies " That’s because his father was a rat ! " ) which he’s only able to get out of by being force fed a piece of cheese ( " Moe , Larry . . . cheese ! " ) .
576144	1399158	22454	7.0	Svengali ( 1931 )	I've only watched the film once ? by way of Roan's fine if not outstanding DVD - and this happened fairly recently . SVENGALI follows its source novel ( " Trilby " by George Du Maurier ) pretty closely , which is rare for horror film-adaptations of the 1930s . Apart from John Barrymore's appropriately mesmerizing leading performance ( here revisiting the genre after a whole decade ) , I recall one particularly amazing tracking shot demonstrating Svengali's hypnotic powers over Trilby , and there are even brief flashes of nudity ( remember this was a Pre-Code film , but also that our heroine is a model ) ! Barrymore followed SVENGALI with the thematically-similar THE MAD GENIUS ( 1931 ) but , unfortunately , I haven't had the opportunity to watch that one ?
577710	1399158	43288	7.0	ANNE OF THE INDIES ( Jacques Tourneur , 1951 )	This is one of several period sea-faring yarns of its era , which has the added distinction ( although not in itself unique ) of a female buccaneer at its center . At first , both leads – Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually , thanks no doubt to the talented players ( Herbert Marshall , Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice ) who support them . Velvety-voiced Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship’s obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor , and Gomez is suitably larger-than-life as Blackbeard The Pirate . The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan’s wife , who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom Jourdan instills the first pangs of love ( which , however , does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword-wound ) ; incidentally , the film was the second exotic teaming of Jourdan and Paget in one year , following Delmer Daves’ BIRD OF PARADISE . The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne’s character is her falling out with Blackbeard’s crew , and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded Jourdan , Paget and Marshall . While the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type , Jacques Tourneur’s energetic direction and Franz Waxman’s grandiose score ensure an above-average effort that moves along at a brisk pace ; incidentally , Tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle , THE FLAME AND THE ARROW ( 1950 ) . As usual with vintage Technicolor productions , the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating . By the way , differing running-times are given for this film ( 81 or 87 minutes ) and , for the record , the version I watched was the shorter one .
577286	1399158	435625	7.0	The Descent ( 2005 )	Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS ( 2002 ) with this nail-biting sleeper . After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE ( 1972 ) mode , the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise . The all-female cast members are relative newcomers , a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements , the supernatural and , at times , themselves . It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the " Crawlers " ( with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up ) for as long as he does ; if I were to nitpick , I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different ' voice ' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC ( 1997 ) . The surprise , downbeat , open-ended ' twist ' ending , then , is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before .
576595	1399158	536829	7.0	Carry On Laughing : Orgy And Bess ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	This is one of the funniest entries in the alternate TV comedy series , most of which were period spoofs of famous historical events and figures ; it's also notable as being the " Carry On " swan-song for both Sid James and Hattie Jacques ? they play Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth I respectively . The script includes such a barrage of ( typically ) vulgar puns and topical gags ( some of them fairly obscure at this juncture ) that one's barely able to keep up with it ! As was to be expected by now , too , one of the central characters ? Sir Walter Raleigh ? is depicted as outrageously effeminate ; latter-day series regular Jack Douglas , then , appears in two roles for no very good reason . Of course , the ubiquitous " Carry On " siren ? diminutive , buxom and plucky Barbara Windsor ? is on hand to divert Drake's attentions from the corpulent queen , so that his position as the latter's chief confidante can be usurped by Douglas ' scheming Lord Essex ! When caught in the act , Jacques immediately forgives James ? except that , just then , her intended suitor appears on the scene ? Kenneth Connor as King Philip II of Spain ( made to speak gibberish when delivering lines in his ' native ' language : incidentally , much is made of the fact that the two monarchs share their names with England's own current royals ! ) ; this affront , of course , throws the two countries into war ? fought and won off-screen by the ' heroic ' Drake ? the direct result of which is the promise set up by the risqué title ( obviously derived from the celebrated George Gershwin musical " Porgy And Bess " ) though , of course , the only thing we're allowed to see is the queen's chambers being filled by prancing courtiers !
576485	1399158	536830	7.0	Carry On Laughing : Short Knight , Long Daze ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	This one's a good entry in the alternate " Carry On " series , once again revolving around a medieval theme . Kenneth Connor is an unlikely , pint-sized King Arthur ( he's possibly my favorite actor from the gang and perhaps the most underrated ) , Peter Butterworth is a bumbling Merlin , Joan Sims a flirtatious Guinevere , Jack Douglas ( a late but welcome addition to the " Carry On " team ) is the effeminate Sir Gay ( ! ) , Bernard Bresslaw the imposing knight who's supposed to defend the King's valor but prefers to spend time with the Queen ! A jousting tournament intending to showcase the cowardly Bresslaw's prowess sees Connor and Butterworth ? with the dubious help of Douglas ? cheat by devising a concoction capable of rendering the latter invisible to slay the proposed challengers ; on the day of the event , however , the effect wears off and they have to resort to a different weapon ! Incidentally , that same year , the Monty Python gang ? who started out in TV and then went into features ? made a big-screen ( and obviously superior ) lampoon of Arthurian times with the classic MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL ( 1975 ) .
576999	1399158	47577	7.0	THIS ISLAND EARTH ( Joseph M . Newman and , uncredited , Jack Arnold , 1955 )	While my first viewing of this one ( which took place ages ago on Italian TV ) had suffered from a botched reception , this second attempt came via a full-frame DivX copy ? resulting in the intermittent jerky movement during playback which characterizes this particular format ! Anyway , the film may not be as cerebral as FORBIDDEN PLANET ( 1956 ) or as philosophical as THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN ( 1957 ) , but it's certainly more ambitious ( and intelligent ) than your average sci-fi flick ? though , ultimately , emerging to be more interesting than entertaining ( chiefly due to its surplus of technical chat ) . Jeff Morrow is an unusually benign presence among the typically superior ( with elongated foreheads to show for it ! ) and tyrannical aliens ? intent on colonizing the Earth because their own planet , Metaluna ( literally meaning ' half-moon ' ) , is dying . Handsome , deep-voiced Rex Reason makes for a rugged lead ? while Faith Domergue provides the requisite female / romantic interest ( though she's hardly believable as an ace atomic scientist ! ) . The electronic score ( credited to Universal's Head of Music Department Joseph Gershenson , but which is actually a combination of several pieces by Henry Mancini , Hans Salter and Herman Stein ! ) underlines the film's pervading mood of mystery and fantasy . Interestingly , this was edited by Virgil Vogel ? who was soon to step into the director's chair for the rather dismal THE MOLE PEOPLE ( 1956 ) , which I've just watched . THIS ISLAND EARTH ( adapted from a novel by Raymond F . Jones ) is , perhaps , best-remembered for its scenes on Metaluna ( which were allegedly re-shot by none other than Jack Arnold ! ) ; however , these only take up the last twenty minutes of the running-time ? while the appearance of the famous dome-headed mutants ( with their pincer-like hands ) , disappointingly , amounts to a limited screen-time and very little purpose ! One further quibble here is the fact that , after having taken the trouble to kidnap Reason and Domergue out of space so as to ensure their help in the defense of Metaluna , the inhabitants are ready to lobotomize the couple at the first sign of defiance ! That said , the general look of the film is suitably impressive ? and it was deemed an important enough undertaking to be shot in color ( even if this came across as rather muddy , especially during the first half , in the print I watched ! ) . One doesn't really mind the charmingly dated special effects ( which culminate in the destruction of Metaluna ) , or the fact that the planet's surface is depicted largely through matte paintings . By the way , an essay I often read as a kid ( found in an old movie-magazine of my father's ) had named THIS ISLAND EARTH one of the top 3 efforts from Hollywood's Golden Age of Sci-Fi movies ? along with 20 , 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA ( 1954 ) and FORBIDDEN PLANET !
577283	1399158	65916	7.0	JOE ( John G . Avildsen , 1970 )	A fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural / political aura of the late 60s ( taking in the class struggle as well ) which , ironically , in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views , makes full use of the permissiveness that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize ! Norman Wexler's incisive Oscar-nominated script is superbly enacted by Peter Boyle ( in a powerhouse performance ) who manages to make his garrulous , down-to-earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character ( with a barely-disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion ) likable , even admirable ; indeed , he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young Marlon Brando ! Similar to other generation gap movies of its era like TAKING OFF ( 1971 ) and HARDCORE ( 1978 ) but also nihilistic vigilante films like DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) and TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) - interestingly enough , two of these also feature Boyle - JOE ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm . . .
577761	1399158	64902	7.0	THE BLOOD ROSE ( Claude Mulot , 1969 )	I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it , so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare . Even more surprising is the fact that I found this to be so good and engaging , despite being the nth revamping of one of my all-time favorites - Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE ( 1959 ) . Also , I expected it to be much trashier ? considering the dubious epithet " the first sex-horror film " that's attached to it ; there is a reasonable amount of nudity here , but this is generally tastefully presented . Actually , it exudes a rather classy atmosphere ( with cinematography by the renowned Roger Fellous ) peculiar to French horror cinema ? similar , in fact , to other Mondo Macabro releases such as MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN ( 1960 ) , THE DIABOLICAL DR . Z ( 1965 ) , GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY ( 1971 ) and SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan ( 1974 ) . Lead Philippe Lemaire is appropriately debonair as the celebrated painter whose life and career take a nose-dive once his wife is no longer able to act as his muse ; the actor later worked for Jess Franco and Walerian Borowczyk but , sadly , ended his own life in 2004 . Anne Duperey is luscious and graceful during the early section of the film : the girl's loving relationship with her husband is presented in some detail , so as to render her subsequent bitterness ( which even drives her to commit cold-blooded murder ) both believable and poignant . The appearance of her scarred features , then , is subtly handled throughout ( presented mostly as blurry POV shots ) and the make-up itself quite well done . The actress eventually broke into the mainstream with PARDON MON AFFAIRE ( 1977 ) , a successful comedy later Americanized as THE WOMAN IN RED ( 1984 ) . Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype ? since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR . ORLOFF ( 1961 ) , a character to which actor and director would often return ( the last time in FACELESS [ 1988 ] , a viewing of which followed the next day ) . In THE BLOOD ROSE ( released as RAVAGED in the U . K . ) , he again plays the surgeon who aims to graft the face off a live victim : here , however , he's blackmailed into the task and actually doubts his own success ( his eventual fate , then , comes as a total shock ) . The dwarf manservants seen here may be something of a genre requisite , but they're actually well-integrated into the plot ? their rape / murder of a captive girl ( an intended , but obviously unwilling , face donor ) and subsequent beating by their disfigured mistress seemed a gratuitous digression at first , but it does help set up the film's wild and completely unexpected final act ! It's rather odd , however , that no revenge was visited upon the spited socialite who perpetrated Duperey's accident . The catacomb-like design of Lemaire's art gallery complements the Gothic atmosphere of his family château . As for the film's deliberate pace , this is characteristic of the " Euro-Cult " style ? typified by the scene in which an inquisitive girl is made to prowl the castle grounds for minutes on end . Unsurprisingly , Mulot ( who tragically drowned in 1986 ) later dabbled in porn cinema ? though the obscure crime film THE CONTRACT ( 1971 ) is considered as his best work . The DVD supplements include an interesting 23-minute interview with the film's assistant director ( and Mulot's brother-in-law ) , and a reasonably informative essay about the history of French horror cinema over the years ( going all the way up to the most recent examples ) .
577750	1399158	404203	7.0	LITTLE CHILDREN ( Todd Field , 2006 )	I had watched ? and been sufficiently impressed with ? this director's acclaimed previous film , IN THE BEDROOM ( 2001 ) ; the follow-up effort proves to be altogether more accomplished . Again , we're treated to a variety of suburban neuroses ? which I can't help feeling some of the characters bring upon themselves ( more on this later ) . Anyway , the director has the temerity to stretch the melodramatic proceedings ? essentially revolving around three interweaving plot threads ? to a hefty 137 minutes . That it doesn't collapse under its own weight is due to a perceptive script ( compounded by pointed narration ) and excellent performances ; the actors generally manage to steer clear of hysterics ( which only really come into play towards the end ) . Both the talent and beauty of leading ladies Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly is on display here ? though the latter's role is rather small and colorless . I'm not familiar with either of the actors playing their characters ' respective husbands ? in this case , it's Winslet's husband who fares the worst ( as he's inexplicably absent throughout most of the film , except when the director needs to harp on his particular mania ! ) . Jackie Earle Haley is effectively understated in a difficult role as a convicted paedophile ; he obviously incurs the wrath of the neighborhood which is full of kids ? and is hounded by an ex-security officer who , as it happens , had been disgraced himself after accidentally shooting and killing a child ! As I said , the director makes it hard for the audience to empathize with anyone ( despite paralleling Winslet's character with one of the most famous tragic heroines of literature , Madame Bovary ) because the people concerned can hardly help themselves . The two couples don't really do anything to save their respective marriage but , in the end , the straying partners ? no doubt burdened by the presence of a child in each of their lives ? seem uncommitted towards taking that decisive step to freedom . Connelly and her husband manage to remain together after a stupid skateboarding accident , but things seem less certain in Winslet's vapid household . As for Haley , every time he manages to move us by his predicament ( a combination of ' sensitive soul ' and ' mama's boy ' ) is then offset by some needlessly punishing exhibition ? the incident at the pool , the way he ruins his one chance at a date , and the inevitable final act . Well-made and acted , therefore , but essentially contrived ? and , like the director's previous outing , the film doesn't lend itself easily to rewatchability in view of its subject matter ( not so much the controversial issues as the soap-opera elements ) and considerable length . . .
577028	1399158	90192	7.0	TRANCERS ( Charles Band , 1985 )	This sci-fi entry comes across as a charmingly trashy amalgam of BLADE RUNNER ( 1982 ) and THE TERMINATOR ( 1984 ) ? not as good as either , sure , but arguably more entertaining . It involves an unshaven , raincoat-clad police detective from the 23rd century ( the film , in fact , was re-issued as FUTURE COP ) chasing the leader of a group of Trancers ( gullible " squibs " who turn vicious and expire fluorescently in a pile of ashes ) back to the present day , where the latter intends to exterminate the ancestors of the three council members who brought about his downfall . Except for a young Helen Hunt , I was unfamiliar with the main cast ? though craggy-faced lead Tim Thomerson evokes the perfect blend of machismo , world-weariness and bewilderment the role requires . The film is also refreshingly tongue-in-cheek ? with the funniest bits being the hard-boiled hero lighting a match against his own teeth and when , on entering a discotheque frequented by punk rockers , he deadpans " It looks like a room full of Trancers to me " . As a matter of fact , the sharply-written script has a fair amount of amusing one-liners : when Thomerson complains about the implausibility of a name like Peter Gunn upon catching an episode of the vintage series on TV , Hunt quips , " What kind of a name is Jack Deth ? " ( i . e . the character played by Thomerson himself ) . While the special effects afforded by the modest budget could best be described as quaint , the action sequences are adequate enough ? including a couple in which the hero manages to halt time ( via a James Bond-like gadget wrist-watch ) in order to flee the presence of Trancers who have him cornered and , then , to save the heroine from certain death . Though perhaps too low-key for its own good and somewhat under-developed at 76 minutes , the film seems to be deserving of a cult reputation ( for what it's worth , it was followed by two sequels also featuring Thomerson ) ? but , alas , hasn't been served at all well by the DVD format so far ( this viewing came by way of the no-frills fullscreen R2 edition from a budget label ) . I , for one , wouldn't be averse to a more exhaustively packaged and properly framed re-issue . . .
577048	1399158	36191	7.0	MUNCHHAUSEN { The 2004 Restored Edition } ( Josef von Baky , 1943 )	I first watched this in the early 1990s on Italian TV ; back then , I didn't even know it existed and , in all probability , the version I watched was trimmed - since the full-blown restoration wasn't carried out until 2004 ! Anyway , I remember the film with affection and I thoroughly enjoyed rewatching it on DVD ( even if this version is still several minutes shy of its 134-minute original length ! ) . For being made right in the middle of WWII , this is an obscenely expensive - circa $35 million in today's currency - spectacle ( given pretty much carte blanche , the producers went overschedule and overbudget ) commissioned by the Nazis - but scripted , ironically , by a Jew - on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Germany's foremost film unit , UFA , it was also seen as a direct response to such foreign-made extravaganzas as Hollywood's THE WIZARD OF OZ ( 1939 ) and Britain's THE THIEF OF BAGDAD ( 1940 ) ! The character of the tale-spinning Baron Munchausen originated in a book by 18th century author Gottfried August Burger which , along the years , has inspired 4 feature-film adaptations ( as well as a Silent short by pioneering wizard Georges Melies and an animated short that was thankfully included on the Kino DVD and which will be discussed separately ) . Despite the stature accorded the 1988 Terry Gilliam version THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN ( which I watched only once several years ago and recall being a somewhat hit-or-miss affair ) , the 1943 film emerges as perhaps the most satisfying cinematic rendition overall . The film is book-ended by scenes with a contemporary i . e . 1940s setting , in which the Baron ( played as a dashing yet cunning womanizer rather than the Quixotic fool envisioned by Terry Gilliam ) recounts some of his adventures - in the third person - to a naïve young couple ( the female member of which had fallen under his spell at a fancy-dress ball ) . The rest is an episodic fantasia in which Munchausen - usually driven by the promise of a romance and accompanied by his faithful sidekick - journeys from one country to the other ( meeting along the way historical historical figures like Czarina Catherine The Great , Giacomo Casanova and the magician Cagliostro , who endows him with both immortality and the power of invisibility , as well as purely invented characters such as the self-proclaimed " world's fastest runner " ) until he ends up on the moon itself . Quality varies but the end result , as a whole , is a delight and a veritable feast for the eyes ( thanks , in no small measure to the highly pleasing Agfacolor , the splendid production design and the charmingly primitive special effects ) . Still , one thing that bothered me about the DVD was the fact that the subtitles barely allowed one time to read them ( in all fairness , this had a lot to do with the virtually uninterrupted flurry of the film's dialogue itself - hence , something other than a thin white font should have been adopted ) ! The extras were more extensive than I had anticipated and up to Kino's standards for a " Special Edition " release - the best , however , was the 17-minute interview with the head of the German archival company that handled the current restoration , which goes into some detail about this as well as the production of the film itself . DIE ABENTEUER DES BARON MUNCHHAUSEN - EINE WINTERREISE ( Hans Held , 1944 ) { } : A pleasant animated short from Germany about the popular title character , made in color but containing no dialogue ; it came hot on the heels of the 1943 epic film version - though the latter , apparently , left no recognizable impression on it ( as the Baron here looked and acted nothing like the part as played by Hans Albers , nor was the plot ' lifted ' from some particular sketch in the episodic film ) . In fact , the short presents only a couple of incidents ( presumably taken from the book which inspired the film version in the first place , and several others made before and after it ) : one in which the Baron's horse ends up dangling in the air from the façade of a building ( seen in the front-cover illustration of the book from which Albers reads during the modern sequences in the film , though the episode itself is not re-enacted ) and then when the two of them are chased by a hungry wolf in the snow , with the latter proceeding to swallow the horse in one gulp and replaces it in leading the Baron's sled !
577904	1399158	452332	7.0	Les Modeles De " Pickpocket " ( TV ) ( 2003 )	This lengthy documentary is a reasonably insightful look at the three protagonists of Robert Bresson's PICKPOCKET ( 1959 ) - Martin Lassalle , Marika Green and Pierre Leymarie - detailing not only how their appearance in the film has affected their careers and their life in general , but also Bresson's unique working method . While the latter seems to have been as rigid and as elusive as the master's own films , all three are proud to have been associated with what was even then considered an unmistakable work of art . Lassalle seems to be quite a colorful character with his long , white hair and beard which gives him the look of a wise old man or even an aging Robinson Crusoe ; he currently resides in Mexico where he is seen waxing lyrically about his plants and speaking to his children in different languages ! As it happens , he had quite a long-standing career as a film actor and I was surprised to discover that he had appeared in such Euro-Cult fare as THE MANSION OF MADNESS ( 1971 ) and ALUCARDA ( 1975 ) ! Green , who was around 60 when this documentary was shot , is still a very beautiful woman and , like Lassalle , did continue in films after her appearance as the angelic Jeanne in PICKPOCKET . . . although , ironically , only the erotic smash-hit EMMANUELLE ( 1974 ) is truly well-known among the other films she has been in . I was quite delighted when , during her interview , she enthusiastically leafed through an old film magazine in which PICKPOCKET and Bresson are discussed , a copy of which is sitting right next to me as I'm writing this ! ! Unlike his fellow co-stars , Leymarie never worked in films again and is therefore reasonably muted if still quite proud about his meeting with Bresson . He does have one funny anecdote which , in a way , could sum up Bresson's cinema in the eyes of the uninitiated : when his father learned that he would be appearing in a movie , he proudly announced this to everyone who would listen but , after watching the film , he scolded the young Leymarie for his " terrible " acting ! !
577224	1399158	71411	7.0	DERSU UZALA ( Akira Kurosawa , 1975 )	The 1970s was not a particularly happy decade for Akira Kurosawa , Japan's foremost film director . It started with his being taken off of helming the Japanese sequences for the ambitious U . S . / Japan co-production of TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! ( 1970 ) , was followed by the critical and box-office disappointment of his first film to be shot in color ? DODES'KA-DEN ( 1970 ) ? and culminated in a horrible wrist-slashing suicide attempt which , thankfully , failed ! All of this , however , ensured the consequent dissolution of a recently-formed partnership with other major Japanese film-makers ? namely Kon Ichikawa , Keinosuke Kinoshita and Masaki Kobayashi . It's not all that surprising , then , that Kurosawa wandered off to Russia for his next venture ? but it is doubly ironic that his sole work away from his home-ground and made during such a lean creative period would eventually win him the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award ! Among the other contenders for that honor were Dino Risi's SCENT OF A WOMAN and Andrzej Wajda's PROMISED LAND , but it was this slow-moving adventure ? redeemed by its stunning visual splendor ( in spite of the color fluctuation in the battered Kino print I watched ! ) ? which emerged triumphant . Not top-flight Kurosawa , then , but generally compelling nevertheless and providing a good balance between his trademark humanism ( although the majority of the Russians are tritely depicted as fun-loving and rather immature ) and action ( a scuffle with bandits , a river rescue , a tiger hunt ) . The best sequence in the entire film is a spectacular blizzard which bonds together trapper / guide Dersu Uzala ( remarkably played by Maxim Munzuk ) and the narrating Russian captain ( Yuri Solomin ) . This clash of cultures , therefore , turns into a celebration of friendship with its succession of dramatic , poignant , even humorous vignettes . Dersu's incompatibility with modern civilization ? an oft-used device during this particular era in cinema ? brings to mind THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER ( 1975 ) and THE ELEPHANT MAN ( 1980 ) ; curiously , all three films were inspired by real events ( DERSU UZALA being based on his companion Vladimir Andreyev's memoirs , and which had been adapted for TV during the previous decade ) . By the way , knowing George Lucas ' fondness for Kurosawa , the amiable and pint-sized titular character here ? who has an awkward way with words but displays infinite wisdom throughout ? may well have inspired the puppet Yoda from the " Star Wars " saga ! Curiously enough , the film itself was distributed in the U . S . by none other than Roger Corman's New World company ! !
577589	1399158	36840	7.0	FRENCHMAN’S CREEK ( Mitchell Leisen , 1944 )	Director Leisen , who started out as Cecil B . De Mille’s art director , was one of Hollywood’s supreme stylists throughout the 1930s and 1940s ; unfortunately , his reputation has dwindled in recent years and , consequently , much of his filmography has so far been neglected on DVD ( only DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY [ 1934 ] , HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE [ 1935 ] and GOLDEN EARRINGS [ 1947 ] are available – with EASY LIVING [ 1937 ] and MIDNIGHT [ 1939 ] coming up ) ! While he’s best-known for sophisticated comedies in the vein of Lubitsch , Sturges , Wilder et al – all four , incidentally , worked most often at Paramount – he also dabbled in other genres ( or mixed them with utmost confidence ) and , this , in fact is a costumer / romance / swashbuckler all in one ! The film is based on a novel by Daphne DuMaurier – very popular around this time , including two Hitchcock adaptations ( JAMAICA INN [ 1939 ] and REBECCA [ 1940 ] ) ; the latter had made a star of Joan Fontaine , who also fills the leading role here – throughout the decade , she would appear in a number of costumers ( JANE EYRE [ 1944 ] , IVY [ 1947 ] , LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN [ 1948 ] and , later on , IVANHOE [ 1952 ] and CASANOVA’S BIG NIGHT [ 1954 ] ) . Lavishly-mounted ( copping an Oscar for Hans Dreier’s production design ) and shot in rich Technicolor ( as was the case with THE Spanish MAIN [ 1945 ] by George Barnes and an Academy Award winner , incidentally , for the afore-mentioned REBECCA ) , Leisen is ably served by the fine cast he managed to assemble in this case . Even if he’s supposed to be French , Arturo de Cordova is a most interesting choice for the dashing and virile pirate ; I acquired a soft spot the Spanish actor after viewing his impressively nuanced central performance in Luis Bunuel’s study of pathological jealousy EL ( 1952 ) – still one of the most fascinating character studies ever put on film ! Basil Rathbone is a stalwart in this type of film , though he’s a lecherous aristocratic villain here rather than a rival swordsman for the hero ; his startling death scene at the hands of Fontaine is an undeniable dramatic highlight . Cecil Kellaway is terrific as Fontaine’s amiable but mysterious butler , who’s eventually revealed to be a foremost member of de Cordova’s pirate entourage ; the popular Australian character actor would soon after play the painter Gainsborough in another costumer by Leisen , KITTY ( 1945 ) – a variation on " Pygmalion " starring Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard which remains one of the director’s finest films . Smaller roles were given to Nigel Bruce , typically obtuse and pompous as an aristocratic pirate victim ( interestingly , this is the only film he and Rathbone would make together outside of their classic , and long-running , " Sherlock Holmes " series ) and Ralph Forbes in the role of Fontaine’s insufferably fey husband . Incidentally , being aware of Mitchell Leisen’s homosexual tendencies ( together with those of executive producer David Lewis ) , one can hardly escape the film’s gay subtext : apart from the afore-mentioned character of Fontaine’s husband ( who is clearly more interested in his best friend Rathbone ) , Fontaine herself dresses up as a cabin boy for a chunk of the movie , De Cordova is often seen bare-chested and surrounded by his handsome lieutenants , his crew gleefully dress up in the women’s clothing they’ve just pillaged , etc . With a not inconsiderable length of 112 minutes , the film’s first half – more akin to the so-called " woman’s picture " – is somewhat leisurely-paced and rather dreary . However , it eventually bursts into satisfying excitement and suspense – with such sequences as the pirates’ theft of a merchant ship from the docks , de Cordova’s decision to confront the nobility gathered at Forbes’ estate to plan his apprehension , the ensuing scuffle between the two factions and , finally , after the hero has been cornered and jailed , his shrewdly-organized flight from captivity with the help of the loving Fontaine and the devoted Kellaway . The CASABLANCA-like finale , in which the dutiful mother Fontaine sacrifices her own happiness to return to a repentant husband and their children , is unusual for this type of film and only adds to its already apparent value as a superior example of the genre ( s ) .
577522	1399158	48289	7.0	A LAWLESS STREET ( Joseph H . Lewis , 1955 )	This is really no lesser an achievement than the renowned Randolph Scott / Budd Boetticher Westerns ; then again , director Lewis was no slouch ( for he made his fair share of minor classics ) ! Scott's role is typical ? a legendary marshal involved in a HIGH NOON ( 1952 ) - type situation , where he's practically left alone to clean up a town riddled with corruption and violence ? but the underrated actor invests it with warmth , humor , tenacity and a quiet dignity . The star , then , is supported by a most excellent cast : Angela Lansbury ( a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse ) , James Bell ( a usurped town leader ) , Jean Parker ( an ageing belle and the latter's wife ) , Wallace Ford ( predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor ) , Ruth Donnelly ( as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper ) , Jeanette Nolan ( as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense ) , and an interesting trio of villains ? powerful boss Warner Anderson ( who also fancies himself a ladies ' man and , in fact , strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout ) , shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate ( making for a worthy opponent to Scott ) . The above-average script by Kenneth Gamet ( an in-joke shows the calendar in the hero's room as being sponsored by Gamet's Vegetable Compound ! ) gives characterization reasonable depth : Scott and Lansbury are married but she had left him because of his dangerous job ( a situation which she has to live through again now ) ; Scott tells Donnelly that he hears The Beast ( which symbolizes the scourge of the town ) every morning until it's replaced by church-bells at the end of the picture . The highlights ? most of the action seems to take place in and around one particular saloon , though in a montage we're shown that Anderson's ' protection ' extends to many others in town ? include an energetic and brutal fistfight between the hero and a dim-witted giant ( who subsequently joins forces with him ) , an astonishing shoot-out two-thirds of the way involving Scott and Pate which ends with the former left for dead , and the splendid extended climax . On top of it all is the pleasing cinematography by an expert in color lensing , Ray Rennahan .
576432	1399158	75422	7.0	BEASTS ? Episode 5 : WHAT BIG EYES ( TV ) ( Donald McWhinnie , 1976 )	This one's easily the best " Beasts " episode : the plot ? involving lycanthropy , and putting forth yet another of Nigel Kneale's controversial theories of evolution ? is most intriguing ; the whole , then , is transfixed by an unforgettable performance from a typically intense Patrick Magee . He plays an eccentric and reclusive old scientist ( with long scruffy hair and a high-handed attitude to match ) who believes that humans evolved from wolves and has been attempting to restore the link in his private laboratory ( situated above a pet shop owned by his long-suffering middle-aged daughter , whom he actively resents ) . His activities arouse the suspicions of a dogged young R . S . P . C . A . man ? the latter's initial worries simply concern the safety of the wolves , but he soon realizes that he's bitten off more than he can chew . Magee himself doesn't shy away from expounding on his particular line of work ? deliriously ' corroborating ' his arguments by frequent references to the Little Red Riding Hood folk-tale ( from where the title of the episode itself emanates , incidentally ) and in which he states that Grandma wasn't gobbled up as we'd been led to believe but rather she was a werewolf to begin with ! Eventually , Magee succumbs to " acute blood poisoning " ( naturally , he was his own guinea pig ) during a critical point in his experiments ? his last act , compounded by howls in reply to the caged animal's own calls , takes the form of an impromptu speech to an imaginary gathering of fellow ( and previously disapproving ) colleagues ; incidentally , the man from the R . S . P . C . A . is forced to " put down " the wolf , having been injected with the serum as well . The woman's liberating reaction to her father's death results in the decimation of both the shop and the lab ? in fact , everything that reminds her of Magee ; about to vent her anger on the scientist's shrouded corpse itself , we then get a subliminal facial metamorphosis ?
577318	1399158	421082	7.0	CONTROL ( Anton Corbijn , 2007 )	The haunting music of Joy Division transcended the band's minimal output and modest cult status among British indie bands to become a highly influential sound . Shot in color but desaturized to be shown in black-and - white , CONTROL is a carefully-made biopic of their troubled singer Ian Curtis who , at just 23 years of age , tragically took his own life to become rock's first celebrity suicide . Although I had thought that this fateful decision was taken mainly on account of his debilitating epileptic condition , the film reveals that this had more to do with the fact that Curtis , being clearly unwilling to embark on Joy Division's impending first U . S . tour , had lost control of the band he fronted for ( hence the title ) and , more importantly , was deeply conflicted about the two relationships he had going on at the same time ? with his wife Deborah back home ( who had also borne him a daughter ) and a Belgian amateur journalist / groupie that followed him around when performing . Based on Mrs . Curtis ' memoirs , the film by necessity concentrates more on his personal than creative life ; besides , director Corbijn , a former music video helmer , knew the band members personally and creates a remarkably straightforward and affectionate portrayal of Curtis ' life and times . Apart from Samantha Morton ( as Deborah ) , the cast is virtually made up of unknowns : at first , Sam Riley did not seem to me to look much like the real Ian Curtis but , before long , he had effectively inhabited the character ( down to his awkward moves during Joy Division's stage act ) ; the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara ( whom I had actually already watched in DOWNFALL [ 2004 ] and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH [ 2007 ] as Curtis ' Belgian girlfriend , Annik Honore ' ) and Toby Kebbell ( as the band's overzealous manager Rob Gretton ) also score in the acting stakes . Furthermore , the extraneous music is well-chosen : apart from the well-documented fact of Curtis having watched Werner Herzog's STROSZEK ( 1977 ) and listened to Iggy Pop's " The Idiot " ( 1977 ) just before hanging himself , we also have The Velvet Underground ( another band whose musical legacy ran a similar course to Joy Division's ) , David Bowie ( ironically , Curtis is seen listening to the chameleon artist's own crossover album " Aladdin Sane " [ 1973 ] , written during his first U . S . tour ! ) , Roxy Music and The Sex Pistols .
576371	1399158	63679	7.0	TEPEPA { Full-Length Version } ( Giulio Petroni , 1968 )	Perhaps the Spaghetti Western genre's last word on the Mexican Revolution ( around which so many fine examples are centred ) - barring , of course , Leone's marvelous DUCK , YOU SUCKER ( 1971 ) - from one of Italian cinema's foremost political writers , Franco Solinas . Tomas Milian is at his best here ( with which he appears to concur himself , as per quotes found in the actor's biography included on the DVD ! ) ; his ambiguous character is mainly revealed through the film's intermittent flashback structure ( borrowed from Sergio Leone ) . Like Petroni's own DEATH RIDES A HORSE ( 1968 ) , the film sees the title character being constantly ' shadowed ' by someone for unspecified reasons and , like Sergio Sollima's FACE TO FACE ( 1967 ) , we are presented with a clash of two personalities ( and two worlds ) - in this case , larger-than-life Mexican revolutionary Milian and quietly-spoken British doctor John Steiner - that could turn violent at any moment . . . although the confrontation between Milian and an influential Army Colonel - surprisingly underplayed by Orson Welles ( but , then , his presence can only add to the film's stature ) - is , at least , as important and central to the plot ; indeed , their long-awaited showdown is quite splendid ( even if the plot still has a couple more twists up its sleeve ! ) . Needless to say , Ennio Morricone's stirring and unforgettable score is one of the film's trump cards ( and , in fact , the SE from Italy's Alan Young Pictures I own includes the soundtrack - running approx . 26 minutes - on a second disc ! ) and includes a beautiful ballad sung by Christy ( which , alas , is only heard in its complete form on the CD ! ) ; another crucial asset , of course , is the film's beautiful Techniscope photography . Even so , powerful and moving though it is , the film ends up being tiresomely long if wholly engrossing : the print on offer here is vaunted as being the complete 136-minute version which has been virtually unseen since the film's original release ; actually , it only lasts for 127 minutes in PAL mode , which would bring it to about 133 minutes in full . . . but , then , a deleted scene has been included as an extra on the DVD ( albeit without sound , though accompanied by the director's comments : the dialogue couldn't even be re-recorded for completeness ' sake because Petroni himself has no idea what is being said and admitted that , once a film is finished , he throws away the script ! ) and that's 3 minutes in length , which would account for that discrepancy ! As a matter of fact , when I first watched the film ( recorded off late-night Italian TV ) , it ran for a mere 97 minutes . . . though , since it's been a while , I can't discern any of the new footage - Petroni does remark , however , that the cuts effected Morricone's compositions quite severely ; as for myself , I recall being underwhelmed by that preliminary experience ! Among the extensive bonus features are offered a number of mostly complimentary reviews from the time of its original release and publicity shots with the stars and director , where the film was still being advertised under its working title of VIVA LA REVOLUCION ! The Audio Commentary , however , turns out to be a disappointment : advertised as being full-length , it only runs for 73 minutes ( jumping to relevant scenes but , even then , there are a few gaps which sometimes run for several minutes at a stretch ! ) ; still , even if Petroni seems to be hazy about many details , his comments - urged by a moderator - make for an interesting listen nonetheless . Apparently , Solinas clashed with the director over the ending ( which he didn't write and consequently hated ) with the face of the deceased Tepepa superimposed on a shot of the revolutionaries riding off into the sunset ( led by the young kid who plays an important part in the film , particularly in relation to the John Steiner character and who utters the great final line ; weirdly enough , the child actor himself grew up to be a mafioso ! ) . Ironically , too , Welles ' involvement seems to have worked against the film because , like one of his own projects , it's been butchered and released over the years in various forms ! This has resulted in TEPEPA being largely neglected in discussions of the more significant Spaghetti Westerns ; with this ' new ' version , where its essential quality is more than evident , it's definitely ripe for reappraisal . . .
577509	1399158	48215	7.0	IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA ( Robert Gordon , 1955 )	This film marked the beginning of the Charles H . Schneer / Ray Harryhausen collaboration on various fantasy films which lasted till the early 1980s . It’s a typical sci-fi effort of the period : a usually harmless creature , rendered huge and deadly via radiation , is unleashed upon a large American city ( though , being an octopus , its fury is restricted to the bay area ) – and the U . S . Navy teams up with a couple of renowned biologists to battle the monster . Fast-moving , fairly gripping and featuring solid characterizations – even going so far as to include a mildly risqué ménage-a'-trois situation involving the protagonists ! – the film generally delivers the goods as the unassuming but professionally-made entertainment it was meant to be . It stars Kenneth Tobey from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD ( 1951 ) as the Atomic Submarine Commander who first realizes that something’s wrong ‘down below’ , and Faith Domergue from THIS ISLAND EARTH ( 1955 ) as the female member of the biological team . Basically , they’re duplicating their roles from the earlier films I mentioned – except that Domergue emerges here to be sexy as well as brainy ( rather than staid as she was in THIS ISLAND EARTH ) , especially in a scene where she cajoles a frightened seaman into recounting his near-fatal brush with the giant squid . Considering that the creature’s appearance is usually relegated to the flash of one of its tentacles ( occasionally done in close-up for maximum impact ) , Harryhausen’s effects aren’t quite as spectacular ( or extensive ) as in his later colorful mythological adventures . That said , the monster’s seen pulling a ship down to the bottom , causes considerable mayhem at the Golden Gate bridge , and is even given one scary effect when its eye suddenly opens underwater just as Tobey and his ‘rival’ ( Domergue’s colleague / lover ) dive for a closer inspection . I had been toying with the idea of picking up Columbia’s " Ray Harryhausen Collection " DVDs for ages – somehow , I managed to get hold of all of them except for MYSTERIOUS ISLAND ( 1961 ; which should be rectified soon as I happened upon it at a DVD rental store ! ) . This viewing of IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA ( 1955 ) – which came by way of a DivX copy , thus bearing the format’s usual trait of wobbly video quality ( but , in this case , also muffled audio ! ) – will be followed by TWENTY MILLION MILES TO EARTH ( 1957 ; just recently announced for a 2-Disc " Special Edition " re-issue ! ) and FIRST MEN IN THE MOON ( 1964 ) . . .
577017	1399158	51756	7.0	I Married A Monster From Outer Space ( Gene Fowler , Jr . , 1958 )	I had always been interested in this modest sci-fi effort whose legendary catchpenny title has turned into a cult . The film is one of several made during this time revolving around an alien takeover theme ( the most famous example , obviously , being Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [ 1956 ] ) ; its plot , then , is in the same ' paranoid ' vein ? and , while the end result isn't exactly comparable , it's nonetheless effective when taken on its own terms . The aliens ? shown only intermittently throughout ( exposed for what they are , for instance , during thunderstorms ! ) ? are pleasingly weird creations : needless to say , their scenes provide the requisite chills ( particularly a gratuitous encounter between one of them , wearing a raincoat and seen staring blankly at a shop window [ ! ] , and a bar floozie ) . While generally undercast , Tom Tryon and Gloria Talbott ( from Edgar G . Ulmer's delightfully wacky DAUGHTER OF DR . JEKYLL [ 1957 ] ) handle the tension which slowly builds between their characters adequately enough , and also featured is Peter Baldwin ( later of LA DONNA DEL LAGO aka THE POSSESSED [ 1965 ] , which I've recently watched and been impressed by ) as a police officer . Predictably , when the heroine realizes her husband's true nature and turns to the authorities for help , they've already been ' replaced ' ; interestingly , the ' old ' bodies are kept in the spaceship attached to a machine ? which , when switched off , kills the aliens instantly ( another way to dispose of them is by severing a tube in their ' make-up ' , after which they're reduced to blobs of oozing goo ) ! Having watched this soon after THE CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS ( 1962 ) , it bears a strikingly similar ploy by which the monsters intend to mate with humans in order to keep their dying race alive ! Though they try to explain the reason behind their mission , the aliens are still depicted as essentially villainous ? so that their ultimate decimation ( amusingly , at the hands of a bunch of prospective fathers rallied from a hospital maternity ward ! ) is inevitable . For the record , the film ( ostensibly projected in a Widescreen ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ) appeared stretched to full-frame in the DivX copy I acquired ? which was then fixed by switching my TV viewing mode to the 16 : 9 format ?
577908	1399158	312004	7.0	The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit ( 2005 )	I hadn't watched CHICKEN RUN ( 2001 ) or the " Wallace & Gromit " TV series , so I didn't quite know how I would take this feature-length effort ; I must say that I was very surprised with the results . The film was a delight : very funny , clever and with any number of wonderful sight gags that ought to shame the makers of what passes for comedy nowadays ! Wallace and Gromit turned out to be a very likable pair after all , as were the " villainous " dog and the flock of bunnies who , obviously , play a pivotal role in the proceedings . Besides , its take on werewolf films is quite nicely done . The form of clay animation adopted here is somewhat crude ( when compared to the standard Disney style ) . . . but I vastly prefer it to CGI !
577118	1399158	48512	7.0	THE PRISONER ( Peter Glenville , 1955 )	Inspired by the plight of Catholic Cardinal Josef Mindszenty behind the Iron Curtain ? already the subject of a worthwhile low-budget Hollywood film , GUILTY OF TREASON ( 1950 ; see above ) ? this prestigious British production ( based on a Bridget Boland play , who adapts her own work for the screen ) boasts two powerhouse performances by Alec Guinness ( as the proud Prince of the Church ) and Jack Hawkins ( as the wily Interrogator ) . Their interaction is a beauty to behold and one cannot help but be reminded how these formidable actors had already worked together in , curiously enough , MALTA STORY ( 1953 ) and , of course , would go on to do so again under David Lean's Oscar-winning direction in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI ( 1957 ) and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA ( 1962 ) . Although much of the running time is devoted to their rigorous one-on-one sessions ( enough for it to be deemed a two-hander ) , the film allows ( at least ) another fine actor to shine : Wilfred Lawson as Guinness ' jailer who grows to respect his prisoner with time . The small cast also includes Kenneth Griffith as Hawkins ' eager-to-learn subordinate ? incidentally , the latter also appeared in two episodes of Patrick McGoohan's later cult TV series of the same name but which bore no relation to this movie ! ? and Raymond Huntley as Hawkins ' impatient superior . Conversely , the romantic subplot between doubting Communist Ronald Lewis and his Catholic girlfriend Jeanette Sterke seems forced and intrusive ? almost like an afterthought ( whereas it had been far more effectively handled in the aforementioned Hollywood treatment ) . But , as I said before , the film's trump card is its gradual depiction of the evolving relationship between the two leads , which really has no equivalent in GUILTY OF TREASON ( where Charles Bickford's tormentors were various and generally shrouded in darkness ) . Although the main characters and the setting remain unnamed throughout ( lending it a pretentious air of political allegory also missing from the earlier film ) , the controversial subject of THE PRISONER got it banned from participating in both the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals ? although it did get nominated for 5 BAFTAs and , eventually , won a couple of other international awards .
578185	1399158	66919	7.0	The Working Class Goes To Heaven ( Elio Petri , 1971 )	The Spirit of Social Justice of the May ' 68 uprisings is still very much alive in this heavy-going but compelling parable of the rise and fall in the fortunes of an Italian factory worker dubbed Lulu ( Gian Maria Volonte ' ) : starting out as the Boss ' darling for being the exemplary employee and pacesetter of the company , the loathing of his co-workers ( who despise him for how his excessive zeal makes their own lackluster performance look bad in the eyes of the manager ) and his female companion Mariangela Melato ( who never gets any piece of the action at night because of his constant fatigue ) eventually gets to him one day ? with the result that he loses his concentration at work and suffers the loss of a finger in an accident . This changes his whole outlook on life as he becomes engrossed in an extremist workers ' union , finally makes love in his car to a virginal female co-worker / union member he is obsessed with , is quitted by his consumerist hairdresser companion and his surrogate son and , when he is given the sack at work and is on the point of selling off his belongings , another more moderate workers ' union comes to his aid by winning him his old job back . Although there is obviously much footage here of socio-political discussions , scenes of picketing and police riots , confrontations between diverse unions , etc . , the film also has that winning whimsical streak promised by its title and exemplified by amusing episodes in a mental institution ( where Volonte ' visits his cracked-up ex-colleague Salvo Randone ) , the quasi-surreal sequence of Volonte ' taking it out on all his useless possessions ( including a giant inflatable doll of Scrooge McDuck ! ) , and the concluding description at the assembly line of the titular incident itself which Volonte ' had in a dream the previous night . Ennio Morricone's inventively ' metallic ' music underscores the robotic gestures of the factory workers who , despite slaving eight hours a day at their machines , are not even aware what becomes of the parts they produce ! While the film may seem overdone and dated in today's apathetic age , it clearly hit a nerve at the time of its release winning a handful of international awards including the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival .
577191	1399158	34862	8.0	HOLIDAY INN ( Mark Sandrich , 1942 )	As I've said often enough , I've somewhat outgrown the Musical genre over the years and , consequently , I do not go back to it as often as I ought to perhaps . Seeing how this is my third viewing of the classic first screen teaming of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire , therefore , it follows that HOLIDAY INN is something rather special and , indeed , I believe it is . Although the film is nowadays best-known perhaps for introducing the world's best-selling single record ? Irving Berlin's evergreen Oscar-winning " White Christmas " ? it is also an amiably heartwarming slice of impeccable entertainment as only Hollywood during its Golden Age was able to provide . The storyline is simple enough : a trio of entertainers " quarrel " over the girl in the middle and while one ( Fred Astaire ) proposes to her , the other ( Bing Crosby ) quits showbiz to settle down in a remote farming community . But , as often happens in such marriages , the union is short-lived and Astaire soon heads towards Connecticut to try out Bing's happy " busy doing nothing " lifestyle . Meanwhile , the latter has hooked up with an ambitious girl but Astaire immediately sets his eyes on her as a potential dancing partner for himself . . . Although HOLIDAY INN's association with " White Christmas " gives one the impression that the events taking place in it are set exclusively around Christmas-time , the title of the film itself is much more appropriate as the inn Crosby sets up is one that specifically opens on the 15 public holidays which crop up in the American calendar throughout the year ? which are illustrated for us on the screen as they occur , including an amusingly animated one with a confused turkey on Thanksgiving Day ! The musical numbers prepared by Crosby and Astaire for their patrons are delightfully elaborate ones with Crosby singing in blackface ( on Abraham Lincoln's birthday ) and Astaire donning a wig ( on George Washington's birthday ) . Astaire also has a tour-de-force solo number with lots of firecrackers for his partners ? one he frantically cooks up on the spot to impress Hollywood talent agents after the girl that was supposed to accompany him fails to appear ( thanks to one of Crosby's recurring ruses to put an end to their partnership ) . Apart from that Oscar-winning song , Irving Berlin's wonderful score also includes " Easter Parade " ( which was brought to the screen six years later by Astaire himself and Judy Garland ) , " I'll Capture Your Heart Singing " ( a dueling duet between Crosby and Astaire ) and " You're Easy To Dance With " ( sung by Astaire as he dances with his new partner , Marjorie Reynolds ) . The cast is a very strong ingredient in contributing towards the film's overall success : Bing Crosby is at his best ( in a lightly , comedic vein ) as the laid-back proprietor of Holiday Inn ; Fred Astaire is perfectly cast as his self-absorbed romantic rival and has a great drunken dance sequence around the film's mid-point ; the relatively unknown Marjorie Reynolds is a very likable leading lady ( she worked steadily in films for years without ever attaining stardom and , apart from this one , her most high-profile role was in Fritz Lang's MINISTRY OF FEAR [ 1944 ] ; Walter Abel was one of Hollywood's most consummate character actors and he is his usual flustered self here as Astaire's conniving agent ; Irving Bacon has a small but winning role of a yokel Crosby hires to detain Reynolds ( by any means necessary ? which ultimately sees him driving his car straight into a river ! ) from performing at Holiday Inn when Hollywood comes knocking , etc . Director Mark Sandrich ( who helmed some of the best entries in the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers cycle in the 1930s ) displays an admirably light touch throughout which ensures that the film breezes through its alternately comic and musical phases without a bump . Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire would later be reteamed for the less successful BLUE SKIES ( 1946 ) ? which I haven't seen yet but wouldn't mind doing so eventually ? and HOLIDAY INN itself would be revamped ( less effectively ) the following decade as WHITE Christmas ( 1954 ) , a Vistavision color vehicle for Crosby again , Danny Kaye , Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen .
576894	1399158	39895	8.0	THEY MADE ME A FUGITIVE ( Alberto Cavalcanti , 1947 )	This is a relatively rare example of a British film noir , but one which can hold its own alongside the more celebrated American variety . Director Cavalcanti's background in documentaries certainly served him in good stead here , bringing complete authenticity to the situations and settings . Still , thanks to Otto Heller's outstanding camera-work and lighting , he manages a number of strikingly cinematic visuals ( for instance , the scene where heroine Sally Gray is beaten up by chief villain Griffith Jones ) . It features a splendid cast , all of whom deliver excellent performances : Trevor Howard is an unusual hero-type but totally credible ; lovely leading lady Sally Gray may come off a bit too good to be true ( she initially commits herself to the framed Howard merely because her gangster boyfriend has jilted her for the latter's own fiancée ! ) but she elicits all the petite sex appeal of a Veronica Lake ( meanwhile her love / hate banter with Howard evokes memories of the Robert Donat / Madeleine Carroll pairing from Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS [ 1935 ] ) ; Griffith Jones is a suave yet ruthless leader of a black-market ring ( but who gets his just desserts in particularly gruesome fashion ) ; Mary Merrall is Jones ' elderly associate , whose level-headedness and experience keeps the violent gangster in check ; a young Ballard Berkeley is a sympathetic Scotland Yard man , but who doesn't think twice about using Howard as bait to capture the entire gang ; Peter Bull turns up for a bit as a police informer . The general gloominess ( a mainstay of thrillers emanating from the post-war era ) is leavened somewhat by its constant flurry of hard-boiled dialogue courtesy of screenwriter Noel Langley . The terrific climax is set inside the gang's ' business ' office - a funeral parlor , amusingly named " The Valhalla Undertaking Co . " . Still , perhaps my favorite scene in the entire film is Howard's surreal encounter with the zombie-like Vida Hope - in whose household he stumbles while on the run ; she turns out to be deranged , and even tries to talk our hero into murdering her alcoholic husband ( Maurice Denham ) ! As is typical of old films released on DVD by Kino , the quality of the print and transfer leave a lot to be desired - but one has to be grateful still , because otherwise gems such as this one would remain unavailable indefinitely . . .
578180	1399158	39768	8.0	RIDE THE PINK HORSE ( Robert Montgomery , 1947 )	By stepping behind the camera for the first time with the Philip Marlowe mystery LADY IN THE LAKE ( 1947 ) , Robert Montgomery showed that , apart from being a likable actor , he was also an inventive film-maker . That opinion is more than consolidated in his second dual effort as star-director that was made in quick succession and on similar noir lines . Driven by a cracking script by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer , the movie tells of our world-weary ex-GI hero's attempt to avenge his buddy's death at the hands of vicious racketeer Fred Clark ? by extorting $30 , 000 in exchange for an incriminating personal cheque , or else turning him over to the federal authorities already on his heels in his Mexican hideout . Every performance is equally top-notch : from Montgomery himself ? upon his arrival at the bus depot , nonchalantly affixing the all-important locker key stuck into a piece of chewing gum to a directions board or , after receiving a serious knife-wound in the back , deliriously calling on his opponent to confront him all over again ? to Thomas Gomez's Oscar-nominated turn as the friendly carousel barker ; from Fred Clark's sleek , hearing-aid sporting villain to Art Smith's sympathetic government agent ; and from Wanda Hendrix ( soon to be , albeit very briefly , Mrs . Audie Murphy in real life ) as the enigmatic local girl who sticks by the hero's side like glue , to Andrea King as Clark's sultry accomplice seducing Montgomery within an inch of his life . Unjustly denied greater exposure among film buffs by its unavailability on DVD , it has thankfully been regularly shown on TCM USA ( which is where the copy I watched was sourced from ) ; it was subsequently remade for TV as THE HANGED MAN ( 1964 ) by another noir expert , Don Siegel , and featured quite a remarkable cast : Robert Culp , Edmond O'Brien , Vera Miles , J . Carroll Naish , Norman Fell , Seymour Cassel , Al Lettieri , Gene Raymond and Edgar Bergen .
576057	1399158	67144	8.0	THE GO-BETWEEN ( Joseph Losey , 1971 )	Richly-detailed period romantic drama , told more or less from a child's viewpoint but treated with the maturity one has come to expect from a Losey film ( the main plot is interspersed with fragmented clips of the boy as an old man - played by Sir Michael Redgrave - revisiting the aristocratic country estate where the majority of the narrative takes place ) . Though the characters are rather swamped by their surroundings ( the two leads are particularly subdued ) - as captured by the gleaming cinematography of Gerry Fisher and the elegant décor of Carmen Dillon - the film allows for several good performances from a sturdy cast , including Dominic Guard ( as the boy Leo who acts as messenger in the impossible love between upper-class Julie Christie and commoner Alan Bates , both of whom he idolizes ) , Edward Fox ( as Christie's intended , a war-hero ) , as well as Margaret Leighton and Michael Gough ( as her parents ) ; Leighton's role remains in the background for most of the time but , then , she asserts herself during the last third to bring down the couple's relationship - with the unwilling assistance of the bewildered Guard . Besides , Michel Legrand contributes an atypically ominous yet haunting score . This was the third and last time Losey and screenwriter Harold Pinter worked together , constituting a very fruitful and quite extraordinary collaboration ; for about two-thirds of its length , the film finds Losey somewhere near his best - the contemporary subplot where Leo reprises his ' services ' for an older Christie works less well , in my opinion ( and is too sketchily presented anyway ) , rendering an already deliberately-paced film somewhat overlong ! THE GO-BETWEEN won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival , was nominated for an impressive 12 BAFTA awards ( winning 4 ) but received only 1 Oscar nomination ( for Leighton as Best Supporting Actress ) .
577964	1399158	40335	8.0	QUARTET ( Ralph Smart , Harold French , Arthur Crabtree and Ken Annakin , 1948 )	A number of portmanteau films had been made before this celebrated and influential British example – the most notable to emanate from the country prior to it being the superb horror-oriented DEAD OF NIGHT ( 1945 ) . QUARTET , however , took a novel concept by bringing together a handful of tales by the same ( famous ) author , specifically W . Somerset Maugham ; the formula was subsequently even imitated in Hollywood with O . HENRY’S FULL HOUSE ( 1952 ) . The renowned R2 DVD company , Network , released the film as a 3-Disc Set along with its two follow-ups – TRIO ( 1950 ) and ENCORE ( 1951 ) , comprising six more short stories by Maugham ; thankfully , I was able to acquire the collection recently through Network themselves during an online sale ( and those films will be following in short order ) . I think it’s important to note at the outset the fact that most of the so-called ‘classic’ British cinema was marked by a rather genteel quality ( evident not just in the behavior of characters on-screen but also the unfussy technique adopted in their making ) in comparison to , say , equivalent American product from the same era . Therefore , at a cursory viewing of the film , one might feel Leonard Maltin’s rating a mite excessive since there’s nothing particularly outstanding about it ; what we get here , quite simply , is a display of sheer professionalism to abet Maugham’s own keen writing skills . Anyway , the first story involves a young man’s indoctrination into " The Facts Of Life " – a promising talent at tennis , he’s sent to Monte Carlo to take part in a tournament ; his conservative father ( Basil Radford ) advises him to use his money wisely and keep away from both gambling and women . However , once there , he does his own thing and , through a series of lucky strokes , is able to contradict his old man : not only does he win a large sum of money at the casino , but he lends some to a beautiful young woman ( Mai Zetterling ) ; she then takes the boy home with her , fully intending to rob him of his gains , but it’s he who outwits her and returns to England triumphant . The episode is also notable for being yet another teaming of that amiable odd couple comprising Radford and Naunton Wayne ( first brought together in Alfred Hitchcock’s THE LADY VANISHES [ 1938 ] ) . The second tale , called " The Alien Corn " , stars Dirk Bogarde as the heir to an English estate ; however , his passion is piano-playing – which greatly displeases the rest of the family . His cousin ( lovely young Honor Blackman ) who’s besotted with him comes up with a compromise – Bogarde can study for two years in Paris , after which time he’s to be examined by a professional to determine whether he shows real promise in the field or is merely an amateur . When the time for the assessment comes , he’s pretty confident in his skills – but the judgment of the expert ( Francoise Rosay ) is brutally frank . The family is relieved : as for Bogarde , while he seems to acquiesce to their decision and give up the piano ( even admitting to Blackman to be resigned to his fate ) , he commits suicide the minute he’s left to his own devices ! " The Kite " is the least of the segments , but also the oddest : George Cole and his family ( Mervyn Johns and Hermione Baddeley ) are kite enthusiasts , which doesn’t sit well with his fiancée Susan Shaw – who believes it to be trivial kids’ stuff . Torn between his love of the girl and his passion for the hobby ( he even designs experimental models himself ) , he’s forced to choose – and , of course , he opts for the latter while still paying alimony to Shaw ( having , by now , become his wife ) . The situation , however , comes to a head when he finds his ‘masterpiece’ all broken up and , naturally blaming his wife , he refuses to give Shaw her dues – which lands him in jail ! The tale ends with prison visitor Bernard Lee mediating between the couple . . . by persuading the girl to humor her hubby and develop a fondness for kite-flying herself ! The fourth and last episode , " The Colonel’s Lady " , is the longest – and best – of the quartet : no-nonsense military officer Cecil Parker is married to dowdy Nora Swinburne ; one day , he discovers that she’s been writing poetry and has managed to publish a collection . He initially scoffs at the idea but , when the book becomes a resounding success ( apparently for its " earthy " depiction of a love affair ) , he can no longer ignore it . . . especially since all his colleagues ( including eminent critic Ernest Thesiger ) start congratulating Parker and even refer to him as the husband of a celebrity ! Finally obliged to read the book for himself , which is written in the first person , he becomes jealous of Swinburne’s mysterious conquest – which is ironic ( to say nothing of hypocritical on his part ) since Parker himself carries on a clandestine romance with attractive society woman Linden Travers who , of course , loves Swinburne’s book ( incidentally , like the afore-mentioned Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne , Parker and Travers had appeared before as a couple in THE LADY VANISHES ) . Determined to get his wife to confess the name of the party involved in her past misdemeanor , he’s then astounded to learn that the man she was describing had been his former , younger and more caring self ( at which he breaks down ) ! By the way , the film is book-ended by appearances from Maugham himself – though , apparently , the epilogue was dropped in either re-issue or foreign versions ( the ‘alternate ending’ included as a supplement on the DVD , then , simply reprises the concluding moments from " The Colonel’s Lady " ! ) . For the record , I have several unwatched compendiums ( mostly Italian films but also Julien Duvivier’s American-made TALES OF MANHATTAN [ 1942 ] ) on various formats – and this has certainly made me game to check some of them out . . .
578101	1399158	51305	8.0	QUATERMASS AND THE PIT { Episodes 1-6 } ( Rudolph Cartier , 1958-59 ; TV )	I had always considered the third - and most ambitious - Quatermass film ( made in 1967 ) as a masterpiece ; if anything , the original serial is even better as the accumulation of detail ( Kneale's decidedly cerebral script taking in an archaeological expedition overrun by the military , paranormal manifestations going hand in hand with a secret alien invasion , a startling revelation concerning Homo Sapiens , riots provoked by the sudden appearance of an energy-consuming demon , and ending with a plea for tolerance ! ) is more smoothly distributed - and , consequently , better digested - over the period of 3 ½ hours rather than a film little more than 90 minutes in length ! ! Casting is very strong and about the best of all three serials , with Andre ' Morell ( standing in for the recently deceased John Robinson ) emerging as the finest Quatermass ever ; Michael Ripper - the actor with more Hammer Films credits to his name ( though not , curiously enough , their version of this serial ! ) - is featured in a supporting role . The film - among the top two or three ever turned out by Hammer - obviously substituted color for black-and-white ( arriving 10 years after the last Quatermass picture with a new director and lead actor ) ; an inspired touch , however , was its resetting the excavation site where the alien spacecraft is discovered to a branch of the London Underground and , besides , this time around they could afford to show the demon and its subsequent destruction ! Of course , having watched the Hammer films numerous times prior to going through the serials themselves , the narratives hold no real surprises - but , then , because Kneale's concepts are so fascinating and even persuasive , they keep one riveted ( and , despite their considerable length , don't make one restless to get to the ' goodies ' , so to speak ) . Again , the opening credits and the score set the tone wonderfully for what's to come - and , contrary to the monster of " The Quatermass Experiment " ( which the BBC hated so much that the final episode of that first serial was deleted immediately ! ) , some care was evidently allowed here to the preparation of the Martian creatures so vital to the program ! ! Unfortunately , I experienced freezing around the 147-minute mark during playback of this particular disc - but , by fast-forwarding and rewinding a bit , I managed to make it through the effected part regardless . . .
577674	1399158	35440	9.0	THUNDER ROCK ( Roy Boulting , 1942 )	I had always wanted to watch this in view of its fantasy elements ; I knew of the bare-bones R2 DVD but , considering the variable quality of prints available for old ( and rare ) British films , I was on the fence about purchasing it - the favorable DVD Beaver review , then , proved the deciding factor . Given the little information there is about the film , I didn't quite know what to expect : as it turned out , the propagandist elements are as much to the fore but it's really the various human dramas contained within that are its most compelling aspect . Michael Redgrave ( in one of his best roles ) is the lone lighthouse keeper who was once a spokesman against the onslaught of Fascism ( shown in a sequence of montages that clearly bear the influence of CITIZEN KANE [ 1941 ] ) , who has retired from the world when his warnings were dismissed . He's able to withstand his remote existence by imagining how the passengers of a ship who drowned 90 years earlier near the titular location lived ! ; these events are then enacted for us and , with the help of ship's captain Finlay Currie ' acting ' as mediator , he's able to communicate with them ! ! This concept was not only very original but also rather cerebral ( especially for the time ) and is certainly its most intriguing trait ; interestingly , all the passengers , like Redgrave himself , seem to be escaping from the intolerance of their own era ! The life-stories of the individual passengers ( though , for obvious reasons of time constraint , the writers opted to focus on only three ) are all somewhat melodramatic but the one involving progressive doctor Frederick Valk and Lili Palmer ( who even has feelings for Redgrave , i . e . he imagines she has ! ) is the most engaging . The plot and setting allowed the director and cameraman ( Max Greene , who later shot Jules Dassin's British-made noir NIGHT AND THE CITY [ 1950 ] ) to experiment with light and shadow which , along with the literary dialogue ( it was adapted from a play by Robert Ardrey that was intended to urge America into World War II , which had already happened by the time the film came out ! ) and the marvelous ensemble acting , emerges as one of the film's most impressive qualities . As a matter of fact , the cast was made up of established , upcoming and ( to me ) unfamiliar names but , apart from the ones already mentioned , James Mason's all-too brief appearance as Redgrave's sparring pal - who has no qualms about doing his thing for the war effort - is especially notable . The climax , too , is terrific : first , we have the ' ghosts ' realizing what has really happened to them ( shades of " Outward Bound " but also looking forward to THE SIXTH SENSE [ 1999 ] ) and , then , their refusal to ' leave ' unless Redgrave goes back to civilization and do his duty ( his being dominated by entities he's supposed to be controlling himself , interestingly enough , foreshadows his unforgettable turn as the Ventriloquist in the celebrated horror compendium DEAD OF NIGHT [ 1945 ] - which , incidentally , also featured Valk as a doomed doctor ! ) . The Boulting Brothers - John produced the film while his twin brother Roy directed it , but they often exchanged roles ! - always liked to tackle topical subjects and , though they later concentrated on satires , their sober earlier efforts were no less effective as clearly demonstrated by this neglected gem but also the noir about the British underworld BRIGHTON ROCK ( 1947 ) and the semi-documentary anti-Nuclear tale SEVEN DAYS TO NOON ( 1950 ) .
577132	1399158	16895	9.0	FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ( Sam Taylor , 1926 )	This is one of Harold Lloyd's least-known films and , consequently , perhaps his most underrated feature ; I was first made aware of this factor by Leonard Maltin's awarding it the full rating in his Film Guide and , ever since that time , I've been pining to catch up with it ! Now that I've watched it for myself , I can say that the film is an undoubted classic ( certainly among Lloyd's best work ) and the only reason that I didn't quite go all the way with my own rating is the fact that , even for its brief 58-minute running-time , the plot line is somewhat thin : Harold is a millionaire who becomes the unwitting benefactor of a modest mission ; believing himself to have been conned into such a position , he determines to put a stop to it - that is , until he meets and falls for pretty missionary's daughter Jobyna Ralston . Then , he resolves to attract customers to the joint - which , considering that the neighborhood is filled with tough guys and gangsters , this will take considerable resource on his part . Nevertheless , he succeeds and the men eventually become fond of him so that , when Lloyd's impending marriage to Ralston is announced in the papers and his rich society-pals decide to ' save ' him from such a fate , the gang take action to bring the couple back together again . While clearly reminiscent of what is perhaps Charlie Chaplin's greatest short , EASY STREET ( 1917 ) , the film's level of gags and the star's typical ingenuity is extremely high - with only the gangsters ' drunken havoc during its last third overstaying its welcome ; this section , however , leads to one of Lloyd's most hair-raising stunts - actually inspired by similar scenes in both GET OUT AND GET UNDER ( 1920 ) and GIRL SHY ( 1924 ) - as a double-decker bus ( with atop it the star and his ' flock ' ) races driverless along busy city streets on its way to Harold's wedding . Other hilarious highlights include : the early destruction of two cars owned by our reckless hero - the first happens because of a crate of cat food in the middle of the street , which the black chauffeur mistakes for the real thing and tries to avoid but ends up slamming straight into another car , while the second contrives to run out of gas on a railway track and is summarily scuttled by an oncoming train ; as well as another re-used ( this time from GRANDMA'S BOY [ 1922 ] ) but undeniably irresistible routine involving the indigestible ' cakes ' which Lloyd is made to eat by his beloved at the mission .
577873	1399158	28358	9.0	THINGS TO COME { Edited Version } ( William Cameron Menzies , 1936 )	This Alexander Korda production - adapted for the screen by visionary author H . G . Wells from his own novel - can be seen as a companion piece to Fritz Lang's equally mesmerizing and fanciful METROPOLIS ( 1927 ) ; incidentally , this viewing of THINGS TO COME came via the budget DVD from Diamond Entertainment , where it was actually paired with Lang's film ! I know the film has been available over the years in various versions ( running anywhere between 92 and 130 minutes ) ; various sites and articles have been dedicated to this masterpiece of sci-fi cinema , delineating the cut footage ( which seems to amount to snipped dialogue within existing scenes rather than entire missing passages , thus explaining the many noticeable jump-cuts throughout the film ) . The Diamond print - dark as it was and with rather muffled dialogue - was 95 minutes long ( though the trademark London Films opening logo is absent here while , at the conclusion , the scene just fades out without a superimposed " The End " or anything ! ) ; incidentally , the upcoming ( though too often delayed ) R2 DVD from Network has been announced as being a restored 119-minute version - and also to be confirmed is the rumor that Criterion has acquired the Korda library , and the film may therefore be released by them somewhere down the line . . . Wells , one of the most important exponents of science fiction , seems to have an ambiguous attitude towards progress ; while the villains in the film are portrayed in a somewhat one-dimensional manner as either despots ( Ralph Richardson ) or agitators ( Cedric Hardwicke - replacing Ernest Thesiger ) , the over-optimistic hero Cabal ( Raymond Massey ) comes off as no less ruthless in his drive for evolution . Naïve and exaggerated though Wells ' predictions turned out to be ( if not entirely inaccurate - war was indeed just around the corner , while the notions of video and even space travel have certainly come to pass ! ) , there's no denying the ambition and scope of his script and Korda and production designer / director Menzies ' dynamic and dazzlingly imaginative realization of it . Especially compelling is the lengthy section devoted to the war , enhanced by a number of brilliant montages - the work of William Hornbeck ; despite - or , perhaps , because of - their Art Deco look , the concluding space-age scenes are pretty staid in comparison . Other assets are to be found in Arthur Bliss ' powerful score , Vincent Korda's impressive sets and the marvelous special-effects work by Harry Zech and Ned Mann . The cast is peppered with established or up-and-coming British stars but - with the possible exception of Margaretta Scott as Richardson's femme fatale-ish companion ( also cast as Massey's wife of 2036 , all her later scenes have been deleted from current prints but she can be seen in surviving stills ) - the three thespians mentioned above dominate the proceedings with their showy roles . In the end , even if I'm aware of its dismal reputation , I'd be interested in checking out the film's 1979 remake ( under the title of Wells ' original book , THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME ) starring Jack Palance - though , I guess , not enough to cough up my hard-earned cash for the Blue Underground DVD . . .
577905	1399158	53168	10.0	Pickpocket ( 1959 )	" PICKPOCKET is Bresson's first film . Those he made beforehand were nothing but rough drafts . In fact , for those who appreciate the merits of this film-maker , the opening of PICKPOCKET is one of the four or five great dates in the history of the cinema . " These wildly enthusiastic ( if not a little hyperbolic ) comments , written by fellow film director Louis Malle at the time of its original release , seem to belie critic Richard Roud's assertion that PICKPOCKET was " almost universally disliked " back in 1959 , even if this did not prevent him from naming it Bresson's masterpiece . Over the years , for some inexplicable reason , I missed out on it a couple of times on late-night Italian TV so I was ecstatic when Criterion released a typically exhaustive SE DVD of it in late 2005 ; even though I purchased PICKPOCKET while I was in Hollywood , I preferred to wait for the ' right ' time to watch it . . . and that time was a week ago today ! Even if I haven't exactly been watching much challenging fare lately , I have to say that I haven't stopped thinking about the film in all of that time . The basic story is , as with most of Bresson's films , deceptively simple : a compulsive pickpocket who seems unable to mend his erring ways despite all the goodwill shown him from a friend and a police inspector , finally sees the light and redeems himself through the love of a saintly young girl . Although it seems that this basic story-line shares more than a passing resemblance to Dostoyevsky's " Crime and Punishment " - hardly surprising given Bresson's future cinematic adaptations of Dostoyevsky in A GENTLE CREATURE ( 1969 ) and FOUR NIGHTS OF A DREAMER ( 1971 ) - as usual with Bresson , the substance of the work under scrutiny is in the microscopic curiosity with which he studies his subjects or " models " as he used to call his performers . In this instance , the models he utilizes are even more ' distant ' than in his previous films : Martin Lassalle as the pickpocket Michel has a great , blank face which perfectly encapsulates a character who cannot help himself from flirting with danger by accosting perfect strangers in trains , racetracks and the like and furtively proceed to strip them of their valuables ; the angelic visage of Marika Green ( the aunt of the equally scrumptious Eva Green ) as a neighbor of Michel's sickly mother who secretly harbors an unrequited love for him but who will eventually be his unwitting road to salvation ; and Pierre Leymarie as Michel's well-meaning but gutless friend Jacques . Bresson , as is his fashion , prefers to watch the proceedings from a distance and fails to pass any kind of moral judgment on Michel's relentless plying of his anti-social trade . This may not sit in well with mainstream film-goers in search of an exciting thriller - although Bresson did admit that the germ of the idea that became PICKPOCKET was sown after a viewing of Samuel Fuller's terrific Cold War noir , PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET ( 1953 ) - or a moralistic tale with a neat resolution . Having said that , PICKPOCKET is at its best during the positively enthralling ( and , in retrospect , chilling ) pickpocketing sequences in which wallets are seen performing incredibly acrobatic acts as they pass from one thief's deft hand to the other's and back again to its snug original position inside the pockets of its blissfully unsuspecting owner ! Michel's companions in crime are played by the film's " technical adviser " ( and future sleight-of-hand cabaret performer ) Kassagi and Pierre Etaix ( who would subsequently become a multi-talented film comic of the Keaton school ) . Bresson's powers of film editing , which due to his films ' deliberate solemnity are not immediately apparent , reach an intoxicating level of precision in these scenes which leave one breathless and improbably rooting for the pickpockets . Even so , their luck does run out along the course of the film and all three ( although Michel seems to openly invite it ) are eventually apprehended and brought to justice . Some critics have tried to attach a sexual ( even homosexual ) subtext to , among other things , Michel's " orgasmic " elation as he transfixes his victims with his stare while skillfully rummaging through their personal belongings . . . but , from this one viewing , I can't seriously buy into that . Bresson strips away all unnecessary sentiment and rhetorical explanation for Michel's immoral actions and his unflinchingly uncompromising cinematic viewpoint extends to dismissing the death of Michel's mother and a narrow escape to London - two events which would have been expounded upon unnecessarily by lesser film-makers - in a couple of short shots which barely register if one is not sufficiently attentive : the mother's demise is particularly ironic in that Michel is seen exclaiming assuredly to her that she will live through this current ordeal but the very next shot takes us to her wake during which the brash , arrogant Michel - he who " believed in God . . . for three minutes " - cannot help but let a lone tear stream down his cheeks . On the other hand , however , Bresson occasionally deems it fit to repeat things ( sometime three times over ) as when , for example , the events of a pickpocketing incident inside a bank are seen written in Michel's diary - although whether this is part of Michel's jail-term memoirs a ' la Dennis Price's in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ( 1949 ) is unclear - narrated over the soundtrack by Michel himself and actually enacted out visually as well ! As you can see PICKPOCKET is a subtly complex and sublimely rewarding film experience and the fact that it runs for a mere 76 minutes makes that rare achievement all the more remarkable . The film also boasts what has now become one of my favorite closing lines in all of cinema : " Oh , Jeanne , what a strange path I had to take to find you ! " So , what is the final verdict : is PICKPOCKET Bresson's greatest film ? Debatable . Is it one of the greatest films ever made ? Undoubtedly .
576141	1399158	26029	10.0	The 39 Steps ( 1935 )	One of Hitchcock's most sheerly enjoyable films and as such is one of my firm favorites of his . Truth be told , I haven't seen it in ages and , although , I've been meaning to reacquaint myself with it via Criterion's SE DVD for some time , I keep postponing such a viewing not least because I have an awful lot of other less familiar Hitchcock films on disc to get through first ? not to mention those by other directors which I haven't seen at all ! The film is full of memorable characters ( particularly Godfrey Tearle's villain and Wylie Watson's Mr . Memory ) and sequences , one of which ( the innocent hero having himself arrested by the police in a public place to get out of the villains ' clutches ) was recycled by Hitch himself in such subsequent movies as SABOTEUR ( with Robert Cummings as the hero ) and , of course , NORTH BY NORTHWEST ( with , who else , Cary Grant ) . Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll are thoroughly engaging in the leads and their perky banter throughout the film is a joy to watch and quite unique for a thriller of its day . Robert Donat was a great British star of the 30s and 40s but is perhaps chiefly remembered today for having snatched the Best Actor Academy Award from Clark Gable ( playing his greatest ever role of Rhett Butler in 1939's GONE WITH THE WIND no less ) playing a mild-mannered schoolteacher in GOODBYE , MR . CHIPS ; among his impressive credits are THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII ( 1933 ; with an Oscar-winning Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester ) , THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ( 1934 ; directed by Rowland V . Lee and which I've yet to see ) , THE GHOST GOES WEST ( 1935 ; with Lanchester again ) , KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOUR ( 1937 ; with Marlene Dietrich ) and THE CITADEL ( 1938 ) . Madeleine Carroll , who rejoined Hitchock the following year for the bizarre SECRET AGENT ( 1936 ) , was for a time married to Sterling Hayden and appeared in only a few distinguished films , most notably THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN ( 1936 ) with Gary Cooper , the splendid David O . Selznick-produced THE PRISONER OF ZENDA ( 1937 ) with Ronald Colman and the delightful Bob Hope vehicle , MY FAVORITE BLONDE ( 1942 ) . Although I own the original John Buchan novel , I've never read it but I understand that it has almost nothing to do with Hitchcock's film . I've seen two other reasonably entertaining but unmemorable cinematic versions of the story ? the 1959 shot-by-shot remake directed by Ralph Thomas with Kenneth More and Taina Elg and the Robert Powell / Karen Dotrice version directed by Don Sharp which , I believe , was reasonably faithful to the original source novel .
576307	1399158	404032	10.0	The Exorcism Of Emily Rose	A very effective and surprisingly compelling ' horror ' film with a unique ' courtroom-drama ' framework , in which the uniformly excellent performances propel somewhat familiar ( if still frightening ) events . While THE EXORCIST ( 1973 ) remains the ultimate in ' possession ' films , this entry ( little publicized when it emerged ) certainly gives it a run for its money by providing a balancing act of solid scares ( some of which , admittedly , are not very subtle ) and spirituality . Perhaps the most disturbing element of this fact-based story is that , unlike THE EXORCIST , the victim is conscious of the possession and is even allowed to lapse , momentarily , into her normal self - but equally disquieting is the fact that the female attorney defending the Priest ( accused of the possessed girl's death shortly after the exorcism rite failed ! ) is herself ' attacked ' by the Forces of Evil during the course of the trial ! ! Among the most effective scenes in the film are the first manifestation of Evil in the girl's dormitory room ( in which she manages to fight the ' demons ' ) , the girl escaping the benign influence of the Priest by flying through the window in the initial stages of the exorcism , and the intense sequence detailing the failed rite itself ( set inside a barn ! ) .
