407735	865972	122603	1.0	Truly abysmal .	" Legion of Fire : Killer Ants ! " is indeed one of the worst horror films ever made . It's so bad and stupid it has to be seen to be believed . The cast is horrible and the special effects are even worse . I ask the film-makers : what is scary in computer-animated ants ? The only good thing about this piece of crap is beautiful photography . Avoid this pile of garbage like the plague . My rating : - what else ?
407510	865972	92669	1.0	Unwatchable garbage .	" Blood Diner " is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies ever made . I couldn't find any merit , any redeeming values in this trash . It's amazing that some people actually like this movie . The story is extremely stupid , the cast is horrid and the music is awful . It's obvious that this is a zero-budget movie , because the special effects are so laughably fake , so inept that I found myself laughing a lot during the film . OK , some people may say " Come down ! This is a Troma picture ! " . Sure , but if they want to make a horror movie , they should make it scary or extremely bloody . " Blood Diner " isn't scary , isn't even gory enough . It's simply a piece of garbage . If you have seen Troma's " Redneck Zombies " and you like that kind of stuff you might even like this trash , as for me , I give up . Not recommended .
408166	865972	357507	2.0	Epitomizes everything what's awful with mainstream American horror .	A young man named Tim is traumatized by memories of terrible events he experienced in his childhood bedroom . Years later he reluctantly returns home to face his fears of a monstrous entity called Boogeyman that could be real or merely a figment of his imagination . Did a Boogeyman really steal his father away from the house all those years ago ? Are his nearest and dearest in danger as the monster returns from the past to haunt the present ? Does anybody want to suffer whilst watching this piece of garbage ? " Boogeyman " is just another lame and politically correct horror film that's not even remotely scary . The film has all the typical horror movie cinematic clichés for example lightning and thunder , silhouetted figures outside in the rain and dead people that talk on screen . The jump scares are irritating and the use of CGI effects is awful . The characters are completely uninteresting and there is absolutely no suspense . Avoid this bloodless piece of junk like the plague . This is surely one of the worst horror films of 2005 .
407712	865972	93614	2.0	Total garbage .	Joseph Merhi's " The Newlydeads " is a textbook example of late 80's slasher . The spirit of a dead drag queen kills honeymoon couples at the lakeside resort where he was murdered . This film is so horrendously bad that it truly has to be seen to be believed . The acting is awful , the suspense is non-existent and there is plenty of cheesy gore . The character of drunken preacher is hilarious . This is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking that they must have intended it to be bad-this couldn't be some sort of accidental mistake . Avoid this one like the plague . .
407544	865972	91444	2.0	Absolutely awful .	" I Like Bats " is about a beautiful Polish woman , who is a vampire . She would like to become a human , so she seeks help from a psychiatrist . There is no doubt that Polish horror movies are incredibly rare , but this vampire laugh-fest is truly awful . Extremely boring , badly acted and stupid it features the most laughable depiction of vampires ever put to film . If you want a piece of good Polish horror check out " Wilczyca " ( 1983 ) or " Widziadlo " ( 1983 ) . Avoid this steaming pile of crap like the plague-you'll thank me later . and that's being generous . Recommended only if you need a perfect cure for insomnia or if you are desperate to see all the horror movies ever made .
406913	865972	165870	2.0	Extremely horrible pseudo-horror film .	In this bizarre horror film , Ilsa and Sabrina are a mother / daughter team of lesbian nurses with sadomasochistic tendencies who , with their compatriot Greta , enjoy luring unsuspecting strangers back to their remote clinic and subjecting them to various homegrown tortures . Somewhere down the line , Sabrina falls victim to a cadre of feminist terrorists who have decided that she is to be part of their plan for world domination . " Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy " is a truly abysmal exploitation film which was released in America by exploitation film masters Troma Team Pictures . It has also appeared under the title " Bloodsucking Freaks II " , though it has no connection to Joel M . Reed's memorably sleazy 1977 cult abomination . The film itself is boring and there is very little nudity . The acting is amateurish and the storyline is completely absurd . The funniest thing is that " Maniac Nurses " is apparently a Hungarian porno film that's been edited into one of the most delirious stinkers you'll ever see . The hardcore sex scenes were cut out and Troma or somebody else decided to dub it . Some women are absolutely gorgeous and there is a gory moment where a guy's feet is sliced off his body when he runs into a trip wire type booby-trap , but you'll suffer watching this mess . .
407783	865972	104515	2.0	Piece of trash .	" Intensive Care " by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made . This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations . A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner . The acting is abysmal , the action is slow and the climax is laughable . A famous surgeon has a car accident . He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage . " Intensive Care " is clearly influenced by American slasher films including " Halloween " and " Friday the 13th " series . The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid . Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look . You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me !
407529	865972	338526	2.0	Typical brainless so-called ' horror film ' for mainstream audience .	" Van Helsing " is easily one of the worst so-called ' horror films ' of 2004 . Why people compare this CGI-laden piece of crap to Universal classics or Hammer vampire movies is beyond me . Instead of focusing on suspense the film is loaded with tons of unimpressive CGI-imagery . The script is painfully weak and the characters are totally one-dimensional . Admittedly , the opening scene is pretty good as it follows a mob of angry villagers as they storm Dr . Frankenstein's castle . It's shot in black and white and ? for a little while , anyway ? captures the eerie , fog-ridden atmosphere of such horror staples as " Frankenstein " and " The Wolf Man " . After this short prologue we meet Van Helsing and the film quickly becomes stupefying mess . The dialogue is particularly atrocious and there is no suspense or gore , just lots of loud noises and computer animated vampires and werewolves . The film may be entertaining for popcorn eaters , but everyone who calls himself or herself a true horror fan will hate it . . Avoid this travesty like the plague .
408133	865972	219096	2.0	Hideously bad .	On a weekend hunting trip two firefighters Alex Kerwood and Wayne Higley stumble onto a mysterious burial site . They dig it up and find the skull of an ancient horned creature . Big mistake ! Suddenly the unleashed monster starts killing people in a small American town . . . OK , I'm a pretty tolerant guy when it comes to low-budget indie horror , but " In the Woods " is bad to the bone . The script is lifeless and dull , the suspense is non-existent and the action takes place in the woods for only 10 minutes or so . The DVD proudly claims " Creepier than ' The Blair Witch Project ' " . Yeah , right ! Avoid this piece of cow dung like the plague unless you want to be bored beyond comprehension .
406832	865972	71198	2.0	Terrible horror film .	After being bitten by a bat in a cave , a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat creature . His wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him , it's all just due to rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he's taking . The local cop thinks that John is responsible for several gruesome murders . " The Bat People " by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible film . The script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity . This pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it . Even the design of a man-bat creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable . Avoid this stinker like the plague . .
407808	865972	175526	3.0	Truly dreadful teen slasher .	" Cherry Falls " tries to mix slasher flick with teen sex comedy and it fails miserably . The town of Cherry Falls has a psycho killer , who is knocking off the town's teenagers . He chooses his victims among the town's virgin population . I have to admit that such premise is certainly interesting . However the script is bland and predictable , the acting is weak and there is no suspense . The are some violent set-pieces , unfortunately almost all of the gore wound up on the cutting room floor . It's perfectly clear that " Cherry Falls " owes a lot to Italian giallos , but there is no convincing mystery here . The pace of the film is slow with a lot of boring stretches where nothing happens . The lack of gore is also very disappointing . So if you like teen slasher movies you can give it a look . I prefer slasher films from late 70's or early 80's which are better than most of the crap being churned out today . .
407096	865972	111686	3.0	Another mainstream crap .	What I would like to say is that " New Nightmare " has to be one of the most overrated horror movies ever made . Everyone who thinks that this film is scary is possibly 15 years old or even younger . Sure , there are some good special effects in the film , but there's not enough gore for my liking . The acting is solid , the script is okay , unfortunately " New Nightmare " becomes quickly boring . Someone has to say it : Craven's horror movies are mostly stupid ( " Deadly Friend " , " The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 " , " Shocker " ) , laughable and goreless . Why this guy is considered as the horror master is beyond me . If you want to see a good Craven's horror movie-check out " Last House on the Left " ( 1972 ) , " The Hills Have Eyes " ( 1977 ) or even " Deadly Blessing " ( 1981 ) . Avoid " New Nightmare " like the plague !
407987	865972	382628	4.0	Boring drama masquerading as horror .	" Dark Water " shouldn't be called horror movie simply because it isn't horror at all : a full hour passes before anything remotely scary occurs and all the suspenseful scenes take place in the final ten minutes . What's left is gigantic tedium and a seemingly endless build-up to nothing much at all . The main horror emits from the ghost of a little girl with long , dark , straggly hair . Of course Walter Salles horror drama is a remake of Hideo Nakata's very creepy " Dark Water " . It tells the story of a recently divorced mother who moves into a haunted , slum-like apartment with her daughter . Admittedly Jennifer Connelly is pretty believable as Dahlia , who suffers from migraines and must summon the courage to battle her ex-husband's lawsuits and deal with the mucky leak in her ceiling and Tim Roth steals the show as her lawyer , but the lack of suspense is extremely disappointing . Skip it .
407816	865972	95539	4.0	Terrible low budget werewolf horror .	The Colorado town of Fairview is plagued with a vicious string of wild dog attacks . The dogs are mutilating humans , especially around Fairview School . No one has actually seen these wild dogs , but there are also reports of a large wolf walking on its hind legs . . . Who is the werewolf ? This is one of the many cheesy horror flicks from late 80's . Admittedly the make up effects and a few gore scenes are decent , so if you like rubbery transformation sequences you shall enjoy this crappy flick . The utterly terrible music is credited to the awful ' heavy metal ' band called Tyxe . Overall , " Lone Wolf " sucks massively and is only recommended for non-discriminating fans of grade-Z horror trash . .
406838	865972	105401	4.0	Not worthy of " Man Behind the Sun " title .	Unit 731 has to shut down its base in Manchuria and all evidence that it existed must be destroyed . During the shut down , a soldier gets infected with some plague and ends up riding a train back home and somehow this means there is a " biological time bomb , aimed at the heart of the Japanese empire " . The first " Man Behind the Sun " is incredibly disturbing and devastating film , on the other hand " Laboratory of the Devil " is just a rip-off of the original with some scenes of shocking violence added for good measure . " Narrow Escape " mostly takes place on a train . The film is loaded with flashbacks of graphic experiments from the previous installments and offers literally nothing fresh or interesting . Unfortunately they didn't replay the scene of the guy having his innards squeezed out of him inside the pressure chamber . So if you want to watch this one for sickening violence and gore you'll be sorely disappointed . Watch only " Man Behind the Sun " and " The Nanking Massacre " - don't bother with Godfrey Ho's uninteresting rip-offs .
406796	865972	827782	4.0	Pretty abysmal horror flick with plenty of CGI-gore .	A group of paper-thin characters is again trapped in the abandoned asylum named the Vanacutt Mansion for greedy reasons , namely treasure hunting . Ariel Wolfe , fashion magazine editor and sister of Sarah , one of the survivors of the incident seen in the previous film is kidnapped by Desmond and his group of pathetic mercenaries and forced to enter this dilapidated building where ghosts seem still roaming . Amanda Righetti is actually pretty decent as Ariel . Unfortunately " Return to House on Haunted Hill " lacks the creepy atmosphere of 1999 remake . It relies on gore instead . Some of the bloody scenes include one of the thieves getting torn apart limb from limb and another having her face literally removed with a scalpel . The entire premise of the Baphomet statue is a little ridiculous and there is plenty of unconvincing CGI-effects . The lesbian scene is a nice touch , though . .
407418	865972	182996	4.0	Pure schlock .	" Don't Go in the Woods " is often regarded as the worst slasher movie ever made . I can honestly say that I have seen worse slasher flicks like " Hollow Gate " , " The Last Slumber Party " or " The Newlydeads " . A crazy killer stalks and kills tourists and campers in the woods . Anyway , this film is without a doubt beyond horrible . The acting is incredibly awful and both female leads are uglier than hell . The music is abysmal , the script makes no sense and the cinematography is really weak . The killer is just an old bearded guy who doesn't even have a motive or reason for killing campers . Fortunately this slasher flick is never boring and it contains many gory murders ( for example a photographer guy gets his arm ripped off , a crippled guy is decapitated ) . So if you are a fan of trashy and mindless Z-grade slasher flicks give this one a look .
407748	865972	317676	4.0	Very loud and dumb .	Uwe Boll's " House of the Dead " is based on the Sega Dreamcast video game . It's cheesy and totally unscary , but it can be pretty amusing if you're in the right mood . Five friends hop on a boat to take them to a large-scale rave party on a nearby island . But when the group reaches shore , they find that local legends surrounding the island are terrifyingly real and there are bloodthirsty zombies everywhere . The acting is laughably bad and there is absolutely no suspense . The characters are one-dimensional and incredibly dumb . There is plenty of violence and gore on display , including some nice head explosions , but not much else . Avoid this one like the plague , but be sure to check out Uwe Boll's earlier horror film " Amoklauf " ( 1992 ) , which is much better than this load of crap .
406945	865972	1090360	5.0	Politically correct " Cannibal Holocaust " knock-off .	" Welcome to the Jungle " tells the story of four spoiled and obnoxious Americans who set out into the jungles of New Guinea armed with a few digital cameras to find the missing Michael Rockefeller and make themselves rich by getting an exclusive interview with him . Of course they are captured and killed by the tribe of savages . I must admit that the story is fairly convincing and the location sets provide some spooky atmosphere , but the characters are dumb and annoying . I really wanted them to suffer painful death just not to listen their constant whining . Almost complete lack of gore and nudity is very disappointing . While Jonathan Hensleigh has denied that his film has anything to do with Ruggero Deodato's infamous " Cannibal Holocaust " the similarities are obvious ( check out the girl impaled on bamboo stick ) . There are a couple of moments where the graphic special effects are actually done quite well , but the inane dialogue and my general hatred for half the cast reduced my enjoyment . Better watch " Cannibal Holocaust " , " Eaten Alive " or " Jungle Holocaust " again .
407004	865972	845442	5.0	Too melodramatic and dull .	Mommy's little girl Hyeon Su is a normal 17-year old student , beautiful enough to disregard her friends latest obsession : plastic surgery . Or maybe the lack of interest is due to the fact her gentle mother Yong Hee is a plastic surgeon . When one of her friends decides to go under the knife for a little skin revision , Yong Hee gives her more than a pretty new face . The result is blood all over the place . Seeing so many of her friends die , Hyeon Su finds comfort in her friend Seung Eun , but then she discovers a creepy secret of her mother . . . Some reviewers compared this film to masterful " A Tale of Two Sisters " , but it's clearly not as good and memorable . In fact it's pretty dull and offers almost zero scares . " Cinderella " looks slick , the acting is fine and Korean girls are jaw-droppingly beautiful , unfortunately the action moves at the snail's pace . Skip this one . .
407169	865972	113253	5.0	Okay horror flick , if you're bored .	Here-in this installment-we learn that Michael Myers isn't just the Bogeyman , he's some sort of ancient Druidic avatar sacrificing members of his family to the pagan gods . The script doesn't make much sense and is full of meaningless plot developments , and horror veteran Donald Pleasance died during the production . I did find a couple of things to like-the cast is pretty good and John Carl Buechler's gore effects are suitably nasty ( gotta love especially this cool head explosion ! ) . Plenty of blood and violence to satisfy gore-hounds and there's also a fair amount of suspense as well . Overall , " Halloween 6 : The Curse of Michael Myers " remains worth watching and might even provide a few chills on a dark night . Check it out .
407649	865972	1010271	5.0	Murder is clean in " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " .	" The Poughkeepsie Tapes " - a faux documentary about the activities of the mixed serial killer from Poughkeepsie called The Waterstreet Butcher garnered tons of hype before its official release . The premise of the film is certainly interesting : the police raids a home of suspect and finds it empty aside from boxes of VHS tapes . On these video cassettes are hundreds of hours of footage recorded by a serial killer as he filmed the abductions , torture , murder and disposal of his victims . " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " plays like a tame version of " August Underground " series . The amount of violence and terror is surprisingly minimal . What drags " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " down is truly horrible acting . The interviews with investigators ( there is even laughable " dismemberment expert " ) are terrible as was the archive footage of court proceedings and press conferences . The killer is also ridiculous as he giggles and yells and acts more like a total buffoon . " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " is not shocking or disturbing . The torture and murder scenes are usually off-screen and they lack a bite . If you want to see truly horrifying serial killer movie check out Austrian " Angst " from 1983 . .
407820	865972	93974	5.0	A ridiculous sequel to " Silent Night , Deadly Night " .	Little Ricky ( Eric Freeman ) , the brother of our killer Billy from " Silent Night , Deadly Night " , is grown up now and has inherited his brother's dislike for naughtiness . In the office of his 13th psychiatrist , he tells his family's background , including events following the first movie , where Ricky kills random people . " Silent Night , Deadly Night Part 2 " offers nothing new in comparison to the original . In fact the first 35 minutes or so are just flashbacks from the first film . The acting of Eric Freeman is incredibly lousy , however the killing spree in a yuppie neighborhood is slightly amusing to say the least . " Silent Night , Deadly Night Part 2 " is mildly entertaining in its intentional awfulness-that's why I'd give it . Stick with the original .
406980	865972	373883	5.0	Not as bad as it's reputed to be , but Carpenter's original is still better .	The first half of Rob Zombie's " Halloween " covers Michael Myers youth , where he was a long-haired blonde kid who liked to torture and kill animals . On the Halloween night Michael kills his scumbag stepfather , his sister and her boyfriend , then he is placed in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where he spends a long time visited by the his psychiatrist Dr . Loomis . After 15 years Loomis moves on Myers escapes and the slaughter in Haddonfield begins . . . Every horror fan knows exactly the plot of John Carpenter's horror classic " Halloween " , so I won't be wasting my time describing it in detail . Rob Zombie's remake differs from it in some aspects : the atmosphere is dirty and grimy , the characters are sleazy and the killings with a butcher knife are quite gory . Zombie also likes his nods to the horror genre : black and white movies like " The Thing From Another World " and " White Zombie " pop up on television sets , finally Blue Öyster Cult's " Don't Fear The Reaper " and The Misfits " Halloween " adorn the soundtrack . Overall , if you want to see somewhat vicious and mean-spirited remake of an instant horror classic check it out . .
407042	865972	105121	6.0	Pretty mediocre horror film .	Wes Craven's " The People Under the Stairs " is a weird horror film that plays like a dark fairy tale . The film is not scary and there is very little gore , so fans of splatter will be disappointed . Still the production values are excellent , the old house and the mazes within are nicely constructed . The acting is exceptionally good , albeit Brandon Adams overacts sometimes as the hero Fool . On the other hand , there are some bits of lame slapstick comedy that are simply out of place . The film also features rather grisly themes of child and animal abuse , incest , S & M and murder , but it's not offensive . So if you're a fan of Wes Craven's horror films give this one a look . However I still consider " Last House on the Left " as his best film to date . My rating : .
407710	865972	83659	6.0	Above average psycho thriller .	Alberto De Martino's " Blood Link " is a pretty good thriller . Michael Moriaty plays a doctor , who has frightening visions of murder and discovers that this may be because of a psychic link to his siamese twin brother , who is murdering women in Germany . He tries to find him and stop the madness . The cast is pretty good with excellent performance by Michael Moriaty and the score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant . There is some violence and plenty of nudity . The film reminds me a little bit Brian De Palma's masterful " Sisters " ( 1973 ) , but it has enough suspense and surprises to satisfy horror fans . Check it out .
407754	865972	105196	6.0	Very entertaining Cat III piece of sleaze .	One night , an office worker in a rubber raincoat rapes a pretty secretary ( Veronica Yip ) , then accidentally kills her on a memo spike . Later that week , he goes to a hostess bar and sees the girl's lookalike named Minmin , and offers her a pile of cash to show up for work the next morning and tender her resignation . This would have worked if Yip hadn't been rescued from an abduction and rape by a kung fu businessman-who coincidentally happens to be the dead woman's business associate ! Veronica's more capable than any of the men , so she decides to take the dead girl's place , which means the rapist-killer has only one option . Not to be confused with the American politically correct piece of garbage starring Julia Roberts , this " Pretty Woman " features incredibly hot Veronica Yip plus plenty of sleaze . Veronica's ten minutes long shower sequence is truly arousing . There is also a little bit of bloody violence and some great martial arts action scenes , so I'm not complaining . Give this sleazy film a look . .
407761	865972	130487	6.0	Not bad .	Dean Crow's " Backwoods " is nothing special . The film itself is quite entertaining as it reminds me a little bit " Luther the Geek " . Jack O'Hara , who plays William , is truly amazing as a drooling and bearded weirdo . He kills chickens by biting their heads off and goes mad on numerous occasions . The film offers plenty of female nudity and a little bit of gore . The action is rather slow-moving , but the climax is pretty suspenseful and memorable . So if you're a fan of low-budget horror give this one a look-just don't expect something scary or original . My rating : . Here are my other recommendations : " Just Before Dawn " , " Hunter's Blood " , " Blood Tracks " , " Blood Salvage " and " The Hills Have Eyes " .
407706	865972	65480	6.0	Frankly boring .	" Bloodthirsty Butchers " ( what a great title ! ) is possibly Andy Milligan's most famous film . Unfortunately I found it disappointing-I enjoyed his " The Ghastly Ones " ( 1968 ) more . There are some good scenes of splashy gore and butchery , but the rest of the film is overtalked and dull . In my humble opinion Andy Milligan was an underrated filmmaker-I'll definitely check out more of his stuff if I have a chance . - a breast in a pie scene is priceless !
406892	865972	248535	6.0	A trilogy of darkly humorous and creepy tales .	" Terrorgram " is a pretty good low-budget horror movie . It has a nice amount of suspense , a bit of disgusting gore and some surprises . The acting isn't as bad as I expected-my favourite story is the first one called " Heroin Overdose " . It's very funny , quite offensive ( check out fingers cutting scene ! ) and politically incorrect ! All in all I enjoyed this film , so check it out , if you can find it !
407864	865972	91902	6.0	Sleazy fun .	Mario Gariazzo's " Amazonia : The Katherine Miles Story " ( 1986 ) is an Italian exploitation film set in the Amazon . Supposedly based on a true story it has plenty of gore , but no actual cannibalism . Elvire Audray plays an 18 years old girl abducted by native tribe and she is pretty terrible actress . Fortunately she is naked through most of the film , so fans of sleaze won't be disappointed . The gore is pretty good ( there are numerous decapitation scenes , stabbings etc . ) and the film has an obligatory animal cruelty scene . So if you're a fan of Italian exploitation cinema or cannibal sub-genre give this one a look-just don't expect another " Cannibal Holocaust " ( 1979 ) .
407611	865972	416853	6.0	A passable South Korean horror with lotsa spooky dolls .	A cute sculptor Hae-mi and four other people are invited to a gallery of dolls . They are excited to pose to be a doll model . Superintendent Mr . Choi and Jae-won a doll-maker are the hosts who invite them to this gallery . After just being in the house a short while strange things start to happen to each one of the newly arrived guests and there are also other strange things going on there , like a man being chained in the basement and some weird acting girl in a red dress showing up every now and then . I must admit that the dolls in " The Doll Master " are spooky as hell . However the climax is disappointing and the pace is slow . Still " The Doll Master " is decent enough to watch it once . .
406833	865972	131449	6.0	Rather mediocre horror film .	" Kiss of the Tarantula " is a mildly interesting horror film about a teenage girl named Susan ( Suzanne Ling ) and her fondness for spiders . When anyone crosses her or her mortician father , the spiders come out to set things right . Her leering uncle and town sheriff ( Eric Mason ) has eyes for her , and she has the perfect plan to dispose of him . She also takes vengeance on the high school kids who broke into her house and killed her prized spider . She unleashes a slew of her friendly eight-legged buddies in their VW Bug at a drive-in . It's a pretty gruesome , but also very silly scene . Although its ' low budget shows , the film still has some nice touches and a great ending which shouldn't be missed . Director Chris Munger also made exploitation flick " Black Starlet " ( 1974 ) and producers Daniel Cady and John Hayes were also responsible for " Grave of the Vampire " ( 1972 ) and " Garden of the Dead " ( 1972 ) . Give it a look , if you like tarantuals . .
407519	865972	75984	7.0	Trashy mix of soft core porn and cannibal mayhem .	" Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals " is a sleazy cannibal exploitation sickie made by Joe D'Amato . It has lovely Laura Gemser plus plenty of soft core sex , some nasty gut munching and gore . The soundtrack by Nico Fidenco is quite effective . Laura Gemser plays a journalist Emanuelle who joins an expedition into the darkest and deepest corners of the Amazon after the patient in the lunatic asylum turns out to be sporting cannibal tattoo . The film is loaded with long scenes of sex and masturbation and there are some pretty sadistic gore scenes added for good measure . " Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals " isn't bad by any means , so anyone who likes sleazy Italian exploitation cinema won't be disappointed . Recommended . .
408161	865972	444759	7.0	Surprisingly gruesome Thai occult horror .	" Art of the Devil " is Thanit Jitnukul's first stab at horror which tells the story about one family's disaster after the father's mistress uses black magic to get revenge against him . The back of my VCD says : a mysterious and bizarre murder of a millionaire's entire family grips the attention of the public . Not a clue is uncovered ; not a person can be fingered as the killer . The mysterious and gruesome deaths baffle everyone . A crime reporter goes to investigate the case , which leads to a beautiful lady . How can he convince others that she is the mistress of the occult , a witch who is skilled in the art of the devil . " Art of the Devil " offers some gruesome effects including eels vomiting and bloody regurgitation . The acting is mediocre , but the film is quite interesting . Still there is not enough tension for my liking , but if you like horror films which deal with black magic you can give it a try . .
407824	865972	91343	7.0	Okay low-budget creature / horror flick .	Dr . Amanda Hollins , a molecular biologist who , in distress and ill health requests her son John to destroy all the lab notes from her last genetic experiment . She also blurts out that he had a brother named Anthony . From her natural son's living tissue , Amanda has created a half-human monster that sits dormant in her basement . Unfortunately for John and his friends Anthony has come to life as an oozing , tentacled and slime-covered monster , ready to taste human blood . . . " The Kindred " is a seriously underrated little horror flick . The creature effects are pretty good , the acting is fine and there is a little bit of gore . The action is fast-paced and the film manages to be both entertaining and gruesome . All in all , " The Kindred " provides a few chills plus a few intense moments . Give this obscure little gem a look . .
408024	865972	372921	7.0	Lots of gore and nudity . Can't be bad .	A mysterious man named John Stoker invites a group of paranormal investigators to The Fischer House , which appears to be haunted . It turns out that occult sleaze-ball Alfred Fischer has turned his turn of the century whorehouse into a modern day Horror House with the help with Caroline Munro's Carla the Gypsy . The bloodbath ensues as the paranormal investigators are killed one by one by three sexy succubis . " Flesh for the Beast " is far from being a good horror film . The acting is terrible and the script is pretty bad . Still the film is surprisingly enjoyable in a campy way . There is plenty of gore including fantastic Fulciesque moment in which a poor guy vomits up his entire digestive tract and some sleazy full-frontal nudity . .
407787	865972	65233	7.0	Surprisingly bleak and unsettling piece of Japanese exploitation .	Koji Wakamtsu's " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " is a classic pinku eiga film . Wakamatsu was raised to be a farmer but made his move to the big city and tried his hand at being a gangster and a convict before he found his true calling as Japan's most notorious experimental movie director , who made over 30 films between 1963 and 1974 , many of them too raw and disturbing to be shown in theaters but acclaimed at fine-film festivals . " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " tells the story of of Poppo ( Mimi Kozakura ) , a young girl raped ( for the second time in her young life ) by a gang of street ruffians one August night in Tokyo . Left bleeding on a rooftop , she survives the night and meets Tsukio ( Michio Akiyama ) , a fellow teenager with problems of his own . Together they explore the darker side of life and sex , with Poppo's suicidal obsessions matching similar threads in Tsukio's unsuccessfully published book of poetry . The joy they find in each other inflames their rage at the unjust world around them , and their love engenders a tragic killing spree . " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " is a beautifully shot film and the cinematography is brilliant . Most of the film is in gorgeous black-and-white , with a few tinted sequences and a full-color flashback to Tsukio's unfortunate orgy experience . So if you are a fan of Japanese art-house exploitation give this one a look . .
407063	865972	359658	7.0	Pretty nasty and nihilistic Mark Savage's debut .	" Marauders " tell the story of two sociopaths named JD and Emilio on the wild murder and rape spree in Aussie countryside . Paul Harrington's character runs over one of the psychos by accident , injuring the loon's leg and does a hit and run . A pursuit follows that leads to an apocalyptic showdown in the deep Australian woods . " Marauders " plays like a nasty homage to " Death Weekend " and " Last House on the Left " . Despite some amateurish acting and atrocious dialogue the film offers lots of violence and is hugely entertaining . The often talked rape scene is quite tame , especially in comparison to the scenes of sexual violence shown in Savage's disturbing " Defenceless " . The production values are pretty high and the editing is pretty good . Overall , I enjoyed this little Aussie exploitation flick and you should too , if you are into violent no-holds-barred cinema .
407577	865972	116287	7.0	Okay thriller that rips-off " Straw Dogs " !	I just saw this thriller on Polish TV and I can safely say that I enjoyed it . The relationship between David ( Mark Wahlberg ) and Nicole ( Reese Witherspoon ) is well-handled by director James Foley . The film is fast-paced and Wahlberg is pretty good as a psychotic boyfriend of Reese . The climax rips-off " Straw Dogs " , but the movie is entertaining enough to watch without falling asleep . There is a bit of violence and some frightening moments , so the film is worth checking out for horror / thriller fans . !
407319	865972	494815	7.0	" When you hear the siren , don't go out . "	In 1976 the inhabitants of an isolated island of Yamajima were massacred . Thirty years later , Yuki Amamoto goes to the island with her father and her little brother who suffers from neurological disorders . The islanders are not very friendly towards them . When the siren begins to roar , the severed bits of mystery begin to assemble together to reveal the truth of the 1976 massacre and finally unravel the creepy secret of the siren . . . This adaptation of popular PS2 game is pretty decent . The pace is slow and there are several quietly menacing moments . The film lacks gore and draws certain parallels with " Silent Hill " film adaptation . The mystery aspect works quite well and the acting is fine . Give this one a look . .
408041	865972	87161	7.0	Polish horror at its best !	" Dom Sary " by Zygmunt Lech is based on the short story written by a famous Polish horror writer Stefan Grabinski . This is a tale of a young woman Sara Braga who kills her lovers with the help of her servant Juliusz . She is a succubus and her servant is a personification of Asmodeus . " Dom Sary " is a very obscure and rarely seen Polish horror film that offers plenty of atmosphere . The action is slow-moving and the film relies more on the acting than special effects . So if you are a fan of old-fashioned suspense and atmosphere give this one a look . It's really a shame that Polish horror films like " Dom Sary " , " Lokis " or " Wilczyca " are not available on DVD and VHS abroad . My rating : .
406884	865972	89338	7.0	Very violent Ruggero Deogdato's action / adventure !	" Cannibal Holocaust " ( 1979 ) is one of my favourite horror movies ever . It's truly a masterpiece of gut-wrenching horror . In comparison to it " Cut and Run " is rather tame , but it features some nasty scenes of violence like where one guy is cut in half by the jungle trap . Sure , it's brutal but not as nasty as " Cannibal Holocaust " or even " Jungle Holocaust " ( 1978 ) . There's no animal cruelty or sexual violence ( apart from the rape scene near the beginning ) , but the action is fast-paced , the acting is decent enough ( I love especially the performance by Michael Berryman-this guy is creepy ! ) and the script by Cesare Frugone and Dardano Sacchetti is fairly good . So if you like violent and sleazy action give this one a look , just don't expect another " Cannibal Holocaust " . .
407983	865972	95851	7.0	A passable thriller with highly misogynistic streak .	A psychotic man named Brandon Poole played by Tom Dugan , mad at the female race because he's contracted the AIDS virus , travels around in his pickup truck raping and infecting women with the disease . He works for a moving company , picks his next two victims , aspiring models Carrie and Melissa , when he moves their belongings into a new apartment in Los Angeles . When in the apartment during the moving phase , Brandon drugs the milk in the refrigerator and returns that night to find them passed out on the floor . He breaks into the apartment and he spits through a plastic tube directly into Carrie's nose and then cuts his wrist and bleeds into Melissa's mouth . He then rapes Carrie and when he hears her baby crying in the next room , he screams to Carrie , " I have news for you , slut . Your kid is an orphan ! " . . . " Perfect Victims " is not an easy film to stomach . It's pretty sleazy and depraved . The idea of AIDS-infected misogynist is repulsive enough to make some viewers disturbed . Tom Dugan is particularly memorable in a truly demented performance . .
407837	865972	123371	7.0	Highly entertaining little monster flick .	" Aberration " is often trashed by horror fans , but this film is certainly well-made and fairly entertaining . Pamela Gidley plays a vacationing young girl who comes back to the cabin of her childhood . Unfortunately she begins to hear strange noises throughout the house and her cat is killed . A wandering research scientist working the area meets up with her and they both fight with mutant geckos . " Aberration " is clearly not as bad as it's reputed to be . There is a lot of action and plenty of gore , so I wasn't disappointed . The monsters are cheesy looking , but generally they are convincing enough . So if you enjoy watching low-budget horror films , give this one a look . .
407654	865972	1139134	7.0	Another horror film based on Junko Furuta's savage murder .	Gunji Kawasaki's 1997 movie " Juvenile Crime " aka " Schoolgirl in Cement " was based on the same real-life murder case as Katsuya Matsumura's 1995 movie " Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder Case " and Hiromu Nakamura's 2004 movie " Concrete " . It has been mistaken for Matsumura's movie by a number of bootleggers . In November of 1988 four young men abducted and held Furuta for several weeks in the house of one of the captors . The girl was violently raped and subjected to torture and sexual degradation for example she was forced to masturbate . On 4th January 1989 four sadists beat her with an iron barbell , poured lighter fluid on her legs , arms , face and stomach and immolated her . She died later that day of shock and her mutilated corpse was hidden in an oil-drum filled with cement . " Juvenile Crime " is an incredibly sleazy and unpleasant film loaded with scenes of sexual violence , rape and abuse . It purely exploits the brutal murder of Junku Furuta , unlike Katsuya Matsumura's supremely nihilistic and overall better " Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder Case " . .
407489	865972	121556	7.0	Okay slasher .	A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck . " Mirage " is obviously inspired by Spielberg's " Duel " and Craven's " The Hills Have Eyes " . Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore . The film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck . There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences . The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak , but the film is fast-paced and shocking . B . G . Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening . The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong . Overall , if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look . .
407345	865972	350774	7.0	Very enjoyable gore flick with lots of humorous moments .	A group of friends on their way to a wedding get lost in the vast Midwest , and are forced to stop for the night in the quiet little town of Lovelock . The friendly innkeeper , Mr . Wise ( David Carradine ) , shows them their rooms then promptly drops dead the next day , forcing the group to stay in town during the investigation . But while the local sheriff does his work , a mysterious force sweeps the town , turning its residents into murderous zombies . " Dead and Breakfast " is a vastly entertaining zombie flick filled with amusing jokes and gore . The make-up effects are some of the best I have ever seen , especially when Erik Palladino is dancing around with a chainsaw grinding into his neck , or when the top half of a zombie's head is removed . The combination of humour , gore , and good old fashioned zombie horror gloss make " Dead & Breakfast " one of the finest horror films of 2004 . The cast is okay and the action is never dull . If you enjoyed " Evil Dead 2 " or " Braindead " give this film a chance . .
407950	865972	890870	7.0	Watchable horror film , but nothing spectacular .	Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead . Now upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder , two seasoned FBI profilers Agent Strahm and Agent Perez arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grizzly remains and piecing together the puzzle . However when SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and thrust into a game , the last officer untouched by Jigsaw has but ninety minutes to overcome a series of demented traps and save an old friend or face the deadly consequences . First of all I'm not a fan of " Saw " series . " Saw IV " in some ways is a lot easier to follow than part three and the film really works on many different levels , while going from past to present and from present to past whenever it pretty much chooses to . Unfortunately I found the final twist to be predictable and disappointing . Overall , this film should make " Saw " fans happy as the usual demented traps , the loads of blood and gore are still present . The autopsy of Jigsaw at the beginning is especially gruesome and memorable . .
407643	865972	302551	7.0	He liked his women naked . . . and dead !	" Fantom Kiler " is definitely the most sexually violent giallo ever made . It makes " The New York Ripper " and " Giallo a Venezia " look tame . The plot is simple : A small town is plagued with a series of brutal slayings of young women . The bodies are found naked and savagely mutilated . A misogynistic serial killer ( Fantom Kiler ) is unstoppable ! The film is packed with the scenes of sexual violence , there's also plenty of sex and explicit nudity . Still the killings are very stylish and really sick-one victim is literally raped with the knife ! The acting is pretty bad , but the ladies are really sexy . However I don't think this film is Polish at all . I'm from Poland and I know Polish horror genre very well , but I've never heard about Roman Nowicki before . In fact this sleazy series ( yes , there are also " Fantom Kiler 2 " and " Fantom Kiler 3 " ) isn't even known in Poland . The funniest thing is that the Polish and Russian dialogue doesn't even match with English subtitles ( actually some Polish lines were clearly stolen from various Polish films like " Nic Smiesznego " or " Tato " ) . I'm fairly sure that this film was made in the UK and the credits are all pseudonyms-just like in " Last House on Dead End Street " . This is surely very mysterious ! All in all if you like erotic horror movies give this one a look . Recommended .
407338	865972	384537	8.0	Pretty effective adaptation of " Silent Hill " video game series .	In this rather faithful adaptation , mother Rose ( Radha Mitchell ) takes daughter Sharon ( Jodelle Ferland ) to the ghostly town of Silent Hill . It is a town with a daemonic past that harbors a dark secret at its burning core . After Sharon is captured by a fanatical cult , Rose must make a pact with evil to get her back . " Silent Hill " is a pretty good horror film that packs a few creepy moments and offers a nicely ambiguous conclusion . The town of Silent Hill looks very eerie and the periods of darkness are ominous . Visually " Silent Hill " is seriously great ; well-directed and with gruesome effects that resulted in some disturbing imagery . The environments and sets for Silent Hill itself are quite creepy and interesting , and true to the game . Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional , the scares are almost completely absent and there is only a little bit of gore . Still the monsters look amazing and a couple of killings are truly gruesome . However the script by Roger Avary is rather mediocre and the dialogue becomes increasingly worse as the story goes on . Overall , " Silent Hill " is a vast improvement over such horrible adaptations of video games like " Doom " or " House of the Dead " , but as a fan of " Silent Hill " games I expected more . .
407868	865972	204700	8.0	Fascinating .	" Trouble Every Day " has to be one of the most surprising horror movies I have ever seen . Newlyweds Shane and June ( Vincent Gallo and Tricia Vessey ) arrive in Paris for their honeymoon , but Shane seems to have other motives for the trip . He leaves his wife and goes looking for someone named Leo ( Alex Descas ) . Leo has an apparent research subject and possible lover ( Beatrice Dalle ) locked up in his attic : Dalle is very dangerous because she has the unfortunate habit of luring young men to her bed and then killing them as she has sex with them . She bites their necks and smears their blood on herself ( for example in one truly unpleasant scene , she actually chews off one's face ) . The film is monotonous and slow-moving , so fans of Hollywood's horror tripe will be disappointed . Still it's a great piece of thought-provoking cinema so if you're a horror fan give this nasty little gem a look .
407998	865972	56552	8.0	Charming adaptation of three Edgar Allan Poe stories .	" Tales of Terror " is a splendid mix of humour and horror . The first story - " Morella " is rather creepy , albeit a little bit predictable , the second one - " The Black Cat " is my favourite-filled with black humour , and Peter Lorre is just amazing in the main role ! The third story - " The Facts in the Case of M . Valdemar " is quite good and it features Vincent Price as a zombie-woah ! To be fair all three stories contain English horror veteran Vincent Price . All in all I liked this one so choose it as your next horror film .
407670	865972	85701	8.0	Stylish vampire flick .	" The Hunger " ( 1983 ) by Tony Scott is a stylish vampire flick filled with some wonderful visuals . The film is excellently acted-a stunningly beautiful Catherine Deneuve is truly memorable as Miriam-an ageless vampire and former Egyptian queen . There is plenty of blood and vampire lesbian sex , so everyone who is into horror films or Goth music should see this cult flick . The opening scene with Bauhaus playing " Bela Lugosi is Dead " is priceless !
406955	865972	99222	8.0	Short and sweet !	" Carmilla " is an adaptation of a short story written by Sheridan Le Fanu . The film is really pleasant to watch with noteworthy performances by Ione Skye and Meg Tilly . It's atmospheric and strangely sensual with plenty of spooky locations . Highly recommended especially if you're into very subtle horror cinema . My rating : !
407361	865972	285789	8.0	Another violent Japanese pinku eiga flick .	A sexually frustrated office worker hit his boss in the night club . The next day he is told to be demoted to a different position in the company . He gets so disturbed and thus begins his rape rampage-he rapes a number of hard-to-get ladies in his company . Surprisingly the ladies are stimulated by his assault and finally help him in getting promoted . Yukihiro Sawada's " Flesh Target " is one of the countless pink rape flicks produced by Nikkatsu . The rape scenes are brutal and there are tons of sleaze for fans of Japanese exploitation to enjoy . The acting is fine and the cinematography is great . Overall , I liked this film and you should too , if you are into pinku eiga genre . Fans of " Beautiful Girl Hunter " or Yasuharu Hasebe's politically incorrect rape flicks should give it a try .
407498	865972	66380	8.0	A psychedelic exploitation .	Linda Westinghouse ( Ewa Stromberg ) travels to a small island in Turkey to help Countess Nadine Carody ( beautiful Soledad Miranda ) complete an inheritance from Dracula's . The Countess turns out to be someone appearing in her dreams . But the Countess is a vampire and seduces Linda and drinks her blood . " Las Vampiras " / " Vampyros Lesbos " is really a soft-core lesbian take on " Dracula " . The film is filled with hallucinatory atmosphere and sensuality , so fans of violent exploitation may be disappointed . Jesus Franco plays a creepy hotel worker who likes to take women down into the basement . The soundtrack is pretty groovy-I liked it a lot . Overall , " Vampyros Lesbos " is a masterpiece and a must-see for fans of sleazy horror .
406926	865972	223848	8.0	Vastly entertaining pinku flick .	Ran Masaki plays a beautiful teacher who is transferred to a remote mountain school where she is gang-raped and abused by the male students . She is also turned into sex slave and subjected to sexual torture by bondage freaks . Masahito Segawa's " Beautiful Teacher in Torture Hell " is not as nasty as its lurid title suggests . Of course there is plenty of rape and sado-sexual violence , but the film never reaches the level of nastiness of " Captured for Sex 2 " or " All Women Are Whores " . The plot is interesting and offers some surprises and the acting is decent . All in all , if you are pinku eiga completist you can't miss it-just don't expect something totally depraved or disturbing . .
407207	865972	288221	8.0	Another perversely entertaining Japanese nunsploitation flick .	After being brutally raped , Mikki attempts to commit suicide . A friendly priest talks her out of it and she decides to become a nun . Once inside the convent , she becomes again a victim of sexual abuse . " Wet and Rope " by Koyu Ohara is a truly fantastic piece of sleaze . It's not as beautiful and visually stunning as Norifumi Suzuki's exploitation classic " School of the Holy Beast " , but certainly offers everything a nunsploitation fan could want-beautiful and often nude women , a perverse priest , a nunnery full of lesbians and wickedly deviant finale . The acting is pretty good and the main actress Yuki Nokihara has a great body and beautiful eyes . A must-see for fans of nunsploitation sub-genre or exploitation cinema in general . . Highly recommended .
407024	865972	78437	8.0	Pretty graphic cannibal gut-muncher .	Ruggero Deodato's " Jungle Holocaust " is nearly as good as " Cannibal Holocaust " . This would be Deodato's first cannibal film and it's pretty entertaining . The film is filled with animal cruelty so sensitive horror fans should avoid it . Here , we see the natives kill a python , and kill and cut-open a medium sized crocodile . The camera work is solid and captures perfectly an ever growing sense of hopelessness . The direction is good and the gore effects are very graphic . The scene where Me Me Lai has her head chopped off and is cut open from throat to groin , and later has her guts pulled out , is very disgusting and memorable . The acting is very good-especially Foschi is quite believable as Harper . Overall , " Jungle Holocaust " is a surprisingly good cannibal film filled with animal cruelty , gratuitous nudity and plenty of gore . It's not as powerful as " Cannibal Holocaust " , but it's close . . . Highly recommended .
407131	865972	287396	8.0	Great pinku eiga flick .	" Rope and Skin " is the last film of Japanese S & M queen Naomi Tani . It was directed by Shogoro Nishimura , once again based on an Oniroku Dan novel and had a part for fellow ' Pink queen ' Junko Miyashita . Tani stars as the tough yakuza card dealer named Okoma , who is subjected to sexual torture and S & M abuse by the rival clan leader and his people . There is plenty of sleaze and some pretty harsh scenes of sexual violence , but the film offers much more . The storyline is actually interesting and filled with several bloody fight scenes . I have only seen " All Women Are Whores " by Nishimura so far , but now I'm dying to see more . So if you are in the mood for some rough pinku eiga from Nikkatsu you can't go wrong with " Rope and Skin " .
406778	865972	67121	8.0	Erotic , yet bizarre art-house horror / drama .	" Frustration " is a quintessential , low-budget and sleazy Eurotika's horror / drama from the Pope Of Perversion himself , director Jose Benazeraf ( recent recipient of the ' Golden Penis ' for lifetime achievement in porn ) . Tormented by incestuous fantasies , a sexually repressed woman makes love to her brother's wife and then kills herself . This truly bizarre piece of 1970s Eurosleaze is not easy to analyze . It's also loaded with scenes of sex and torture , but the nudity is pretty sparse and not explicit . " Frustration " has been passed for cinema exhibition in 1972 , rated X of course , but has never submitted on video . It's a crying shame , because this stylish little " Repulsion " knock-off needs to be seen . Give it a look . .
408109	865972	67119	8.0	Surprisingly creepy British horror flick .	Amanda ( Susan George ) , a young babysitter is called to watch the child at an isolated British manor . The child's mother , Helen ( Honor Blackman ) , has had her husband committed after he tried to murder her and the child . Helen's psycho husband ( excellent Ian Bannen ) returns home and terrorizes young Amanda while Helen and her new boyfriend are out on the town . The film is pretty creepy-there are numerous false scares which work pretty well . The most surprising is the fact that " Fright " is pretty similar to " Halloween " - for example both movies take place mostly at night with a babysitter in peril . There is no gore and nudity at all , but like I said before , there are some effective scares throughout the film . I agree that " Fright " is pretty boring at times , but if you are a fan of British horror cinema give this one a look !
407917	865972	161637	8.0	Psychedelic bloodbath .	" Guinea Pig : Lucky Sky Diamond " aka " Bloody Fragments on White Walls " is often considered as a part of infamous " Guinea Pig " series , unfortunately such claims are wrong . This has nothing to do with those Japanese sickies . " LSD " tells the story of a girl named Yoko who wakes up strapped to a bed in a strange clinic . She is injected with drugs and taken by the doctor and the nurse to an operating room for her brain surgery . Soon the bloody madness ensues . . . Izo Hashimoto , the director of perplexing " Evil Dead Trap 2 " , created also this unforgettable gorefest . Lots of gore and over-the-top visuals and wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere of clinic with walls randomly dripping blood , bleeding flesh creating nauseating piles on white floors and surgical procedures carried out in an absolutely insane environment . The acting is hysterical and the sense of chaos is completely overwhelming . The film is filled with relentless Yoko's screams that are fairly difficult to stomach . " LSD " is among the most bizarre horror films I have ever seen . It truly reminds me a bad acid trip . .
407926	865972	291532	8.0	Cold and detached bestiality pinku .	At heart , " Horse Woman Dog " is an extremely perverse rural pinku , in which a necrophiliac ( Kazuhiro Sano ) lives in a secluded house with a female amnesiac and a woman who murdered her sister . Sato centers his attention on the psycho-sexual deterioration of his protagonists . The film is quite unsettling with two graphic bestiality scenes involving a dog and a horse . There is also plenty of perverse sex on display , unfortunately the erotic scenes are heavily censored optically . The lack of subtitles on my DVD-R is the main reason of the absence of details in this review . Still Sato is a very interesting pinku director that tries to disturb the viewer and usually succeeds . .
408100	865972	129332	8.0	Delicious horror film .	Antonia Bird's " Ravenous " is one of the finest low-budget horror movies of recent years . It's a brilliant mix of cannibalism , gruesome gore , sly black humour and quasi-philosophy . The script by Ted Griffin is absolutely stupendous . It's an irresistible blend of Native American legend ( you absorb the strength or spirit of who you eat ) , the Donner tragedy , and the story of Sawney Bean . Bean with his wife and his numerous offspring , dwelt in a cave in Galloway , Scotland , during the sixteenth century . The family cave was close to the sea and they lived by highway robbery : ambushing , killing and then eating passers-by . Any parts of the body which they were not able to eat once were pickled in brine or hung in their cave . Over a period of twenty-five years it was proved that Bean and his family were estimated to have killed and eaten more than a thousand people . The acting is wonderful-Guy Pearce shines in a difficult role as a Lieutant John Boyd . " Ravenous " was shot in the Czech Republic and Slovakia , and the landscape and climate is put to fantastic use . The score by Damon Albarn ( of British band Blur ) and Michael Nyman is very spooky and atmospheric . The film is loaded with brutal violence and gore , so if you're squeamish give it a miss . However if you're a horror fan with a taste for something dark and sinister , then you're in for a rare treat . Highly recommended .
407887	865972	287701	8.0	Sleazy Japanese nunsploitation flick .	Japanese nunsploitation cinema is not as popular as Italian . Some entries in this genre include Norifumi Suzuki's very stylish " School of the Holy Beast " , Masaru Konuma's " Cloistered Nun : Runa's Confession " , Koyu Ohara's " Sister Lucia's Dishonor " and " Wet Rope Confession " , Hiroshi Mukai's " Nun : Secret " , Nobuaki Shirai's " Nun Story : Frustration in Black " and Mamoru Watanabe's " Rope Of Hell : A Nun's Story " and " Electric Bible : Sister Hunting " . " Nun Story : Frustration in Black " is a pretty perverse and blasphemous Japanese nunsploit . There is plenty of sex and whipping on display and even two scenes of nun rape . I have this Nikkatsu pinker in Japanese with no subtitles , so the plot went completely beyond me , but as a fan of Japanese exploitation I enjoyed it . .
406844	865972	1001333	8.0	Very gory low-budget slasher .	A bunch of college age kids stop at a roadside bar / restaurant and are asked by the manager if they can go up to his shed in the woods of Halcyon Ridge to take care of a few things for him because he can't do it for some reason . He agrees to give them some cash and feed them and take care of their first night of drinks on their first night of vacation . The teenagers agree to help out . While in the shed they come across a projector and decide to watch some films . The films however are explicit and graphic murders of campers in the woods . It appears that there is a fat butcher in the woods preying on unsuspecting campers . . . This independent horror flick is surprisingly well-made and acted . The story itself is not original , the lack of suspense is the main drawback , but " Carver " certainly delivers the graphic gore . Some kill scenes are actually very brutal and unpleasant and that's why I enjoyed this slick and highly unoriginal flick with the killer resembling fat hulking Buddy from " Slaughterhouse " . .
407622	865972	371839	8.0	Absolutely vile and sickening film .	Daisuke Yamanouchi's " Mu Zan E " is about a young journalist , who is searching for snuff movies . The film shows us a snuff / porn making underground industry ala " Last House on Dead End Street " or " Tesis " . It's extremely grim and gory and it pulls no punches with its sheer nastiness . There are some incredibly revolting scenes of gore and sexual violence , so fans of Japanese pinku eiga sickies won't be disappointed . It seems to me that Japanese culture is loaded with sadism and bloodletting and this carries over into the realms of cinema and literature . Anyway , if you're a fan of the " Guinea Pig " series or " Cannibal Holocaust " you can't miss this one . However if you're squeamish don't watch it !
407143	865972	85609	9.0	Truly bizarre horror film from Hong Kong .	" Red Spell Spells Red " is one of the rarest HK horror films in my collection . I managed to get this extremely obscure piece of gory horror on VCD whilst being in Kuala Lumpur . In a big cave an evil dwarf sorcerer is performing a bizarre ritual . Suddenly four righteous sorcerers enter the cave and attack him . In the subsequent struggle they wound the dwarf sorcerer fatally and throw him into a stone coffin . They carefully seal the coffin . The present time : a group of photographers investigate the legend of the evil sorcerer . They enter the cave and break the seal . Red smoke gushes from the coffin and ghastly things start to happen . A young man is killed by an unseen force , another is killed by the woods that came alive . When dozens of scorpions attack the people in the village , it seems clear that village is cursed . An old sorcerer tries to remove the powerful spell . " Red Spell Spells Red " is a dark and suspenseful horror film that left me stunned . The tone of the film is serious , albeit there is a little bit of humor to be found here . The scenes of scorpions attacking people are creepy and horrifying . The film has some grisly scenes of animal cruelty thrown in for a good measure . Some pigs are killed with a knife and in truly disgusting moment a possessed man kills a hen by eating it alive in front of the camera . The gore effects are surprisingly effective for example a hand is cut off after the sting of the scorpion or a woman is attacked by a fishing net and wooden beams . The film is almost impossible to find , so don't hesitate to get a copy . .
407844	865972	75931	9.0	A techno-horror masterpiece !	I watched this one yesterday and all I can say is : wow ! Very clever , intelligent and stylish horror / sci-fi with some memorable visuals and lots of suspense . Julie Christie ( " Don't Look Now " ) is excellent in the lead role , and Donald Cammell's direction is well-handled . The film is pretty hard to find , so if you get a chance watch it ! - a must-see !
407817	865972	285853	9.0	Another great rape-themed violent pink from Yasuharu Hasebe .	A Japanese policewoman is raped by a black-gloved truck driver in a very stylish and unsettling rape scene . After the sexual assault the woman becomes obsessed with rough sex and rape . " Attacked ! " is not as vicious as " Assault ! Jack the Ripper " or " Rape ! 13th Hour " , but sleaze comes quick and heavy in this misogynistic exploitation classic . The classical score is awesome and welcome change from usual jazz scores of Hasebe's violent pink flicks . For fans of Nikkatsu's Roman Pornos or pinku eiga cinema in general " Attacked ! " is a must-see . Finally big thanks for fertilecelluloid for giving me an opportunity to watch this unfairly forgotten and ignored violent pink . .
407255	865972	67690	9.0	A masterpiece of lesbian vampire horror .	Delphine Seyrig plays the Countess Erzsebet Bathory ( a real historical figure who murdered hundreds of young women in her quest for immortality ) . In the film , Bathory and her young female companion ( Andrea Rau ) cross paths with a young couple , Valerie and Stefan who are honeymooning during the off-season in Europe . At first the couple seem fairly normal , but things quickly sour , as the woman is shown to be emotionally unstable and the man is very violent and turned on by death . Their relationship is also undermined by homosexuality on both sides . There are intimations that Stefan is in thrall to an older man back in England and Valerie soon falls under the spell of the ageless and beautiful Countess Bathory . " Daughters of Darkness " is a mesmerizing and hypnotic masterpiece of lesbian vampire film . The use of color is extremely stylish , the mood is fantastic and the atmosphere is chilling and sexually tense . The visual beauty of this film is simply phenomenal !
407362	865972	287802	9.0	Surprisingly comical rape extravaganza .	" Raping ! " is another very rare pinku eiga rape film made with gallons of style by Yasuharu Hasebe . It's ultra-sleazy and surprisingly comical as the main heroine is raped constantly on her way to Tokyo . The rapists are for example a trucker , an owner of love hotel , a mechanic , a doctor , even the cops . There is also a homosexual gang-rape scene of a would-be rapist by three leather-clad bikers . Despite of its short running time " Raping ! " looks terrific . The acting is fine and the jazz score is brilliant . Of course " Yaru ! " is not as upsetting as Yasuharu Hasebe's earlier pinky violence flicks , however fans of cinematic filth should give it a look as soon as possible . Highly recommended , especially for pinku eiga newbies .
407603	865972	67696	9.0	Wonderful Italian giallo .	Umberto Lenzi's " Seven Blood-Stained Orchids " is a surprisingly well-made and captivating giallo . A black-gloved killer is murdering beautiful women and one of them survives , but her assailant thinks that she is dead . So her hubby decides to look for the killer . The film is never boring and there are some tension-filled moments . The murders are pretty tame , but the power drill scene is quite gruesome . The women here are absolutely gorgeous and there is a nice amount of nudity . The opening with the black gloved figure driving at night is a terrific scene . So if you're a fan of Italian giallos you can't go wrong with " Seven Blood-Stained Orchids " . Highly recommended . .
407136	865972	288217	9.0	Severe sexual abuse of Japanese schoolgirls .	While stopping off for a toilet break , a busload of 35 high school girls on a study trip and their teacher find their vehicle hijacked by three armed thugs , who start systematically degrading , raping and then discarding their victims onto the roadside where they are picked up and rescued by a sympathetic trucker following in pursuit of the fleeing bus . " White Rose Campus : Then Everybody Gets Raped " has to be seen to be believed . It's so ridiculously over-the-top that it's hard to take it seriously . Still the misogyny is rampant through its projection time and the scene of rapist inserting the bloody tampons up his nose totally cracked me up . Fans of pinku eiga should give it a try . .
407374	865972	80464	9.0	Excellent shocker !	A concentrated evil power coming by an evil mirror wreaks havoc with the inhabitants of a small American farming community . " The Boogeyman " directed by Ulli Lommel ( " The Devonsville Terror " ) isn't just a generic slasher film . It borrows some elements from " Halloween " ( 1978 ) and " The Exorcist " ( 1973 ) , but it's very creepy ! There are some gruesome death scenes , the film includes also mirror symbolism , childhood trauma etc . This is pure horror without any humor , so check it out ! Recommended !
407109	865972	884328	9.0	Very good adaptation of a stunning Stephen King's novel .	" The Mist " originally appeared in the 1980 horror anthology " Dark Forces " and was later reedited and included in the Stephen King short story collection " Skeleton Crew . " Before making the leap to the silver screen , " The Mist " was also released as a fully dramatized audio version and served as an inspiration for the successful video game franchises " Half-Life " and " Silent Hill " . A large group of people is trapped in a big shopping mall . Shortly after arriving at the packed supermarket a local runs through the doors screaming that " something in the mist took his neighbor . " It seems that something very dangerous is hidden in the fog . . . Of course the trapped in a building formula is nothing new , but the idea of not knowing what has them trapped is utterly fascinating . " The Mist " is atmospheric , incredibly well-acted and the use of " Host of Seraphim " by Dead Can Dance during the depressing climax is absolutely wonderful . .
407074	865972	66040	9.0	Satanic horror drama not for the easily offended .	" Don't Deliver Us From Evil " tells the simple story of two teenage convent girls who dedicate ourselves to Satan . Gorgeous raven-haired Anne and her best friend Lore are fascinated by evil . After renouncing Jesus Christ they start to seduce men , kill the groundskeeper's bird and perform various acts of blasphemy . The film is pretty controversial as the both actresses look very young . It's disturbing to watch a child-like girl getting her clothes torn off . There's a lot of sacrilegious imagery and it seems that the director clearly hates Catholic Church , but the violence is kept to minimum . The sleaze is quite plentiful , though . The film is inspired by the original ' Heavenly Creatures ' Pauline Parker and Juliet Hammond , the two girls whose close friendship resulted in murder . It studies the themes of female friendship and teenagers alienation and questions faith and rules . I applaud it for that . .
407108	865972	463854	9.0	Easily tops the original .	The plot of " 28 Weeks Later " goes like that : survivors start arriving home in ' District One ' , a safe zone established on the Isle of Dogs in London . Engineer Don , who survived the Rage plague in ways that haunt his sleep meets his kids as they return from Spain , where they'd been fortunate enough to be vacationing when infection broke out ; the family reunion is uneasy . Army doctor Scarlet is deeply troubled about what she's seeing in the blood samples in her microscope . American sniper Doyle is uncomfortable with this strange duty babysitting returnees in this desolate city . Soon all the hell breaks loose , when the freshly arrived carrier starts spreading infection in ' District One ' . . . Very bleak , action packed and bloody sequel to apocalyptic hit " 28 Days Later " . The escape through the pitch black tunnels , shot partially through the night vision lens of a sniper rifle compounds the feelings of fear and dread . The use of helicopter blades as a weapon , shot from the pilot's vantage point adds to the desperation . And without a doubt , the sweeping shots of London deserted and desolate are unnerving and eerie . .
407833	865972	159391	9.0	A nerve-shredding experience .	I saw this incredible horror / short during Horror Fiesta Film Festival in Warsaw as a part of three short horror films made by Douglas Buck called " Family Portraits : A Trilogy of America " . The first short " Cutting Moments " ( 1997 ) simply blew me away . It's an incredibly depressing and cold journey into into family alienation , murder and masochistic self-mutilation . A young wife Sarah played convincingly by Nica Ray desperately wants to be loved , but her husband Gary Bettsworth has no remaining feelings for the woman , so he turns his jaded sexuality onto his son , whom he abuses . She dresses up in red to become more appealing to her husband ( unsuccessfully ) and after that Sarah horribly mutilates herself . She scrubs her lips bloody before cutting them off , the final act of utter desperation that encourages her husband to indulge into obscene act of feeling . A truly masterful short filled with despair and horrific gore . The second film " Home " ( 1998 ) plays almost like a remake of " Cutting Moments " and has similarly disturbing tone without relaying on excessive gore . We see another dysfunctional family living in their own private hell and that makes the climax more bleak and depressing . " Home " is not as good as " Cutting Moments " , but it surely left me emotionally drained . The last film " Prologue " ( 2003 ) tells the story of a young teenage girl , who was brutally attacked and raped one year earlier . She emerges from the hospital in a wheelchair and arrives back home with her parents . Soon the emotional horror begins as a young woman decides to confront her attacker , a local artist called Benjamin Miller , who draws obscene sexual pictures of a young girls . Still " Prologue " seems to be the most optimistic film of the trilogy and I really recommend it . Douglas Buck is certainly one of the bravest directors around and I can easily say that I liked " Family Portraits " . My rating : .
407698	865972	81184	9.0	Hilariously funny , grisly and bizarre horror comedy .	" Motel Hell " has loads of style and rural atmosphere , plenty of laughs plus a little bit of gore . The film was somewhat influenced by " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " ( 1974 ) and " Eaten Alive " ( 1976 ) , but there are some original ideas floating here like planting ( ? ) people in the garden . Rory Calhouln is amazing as a Farmer Vincent , and the finale when he wears the pigface is a hoot ! Highly recommended .
408106	865972	161638	9.0	Truly sickening gorefest .	A painter named Hayashi ( Shigeru Saiki ) finds a wounded mermaid ( Mari Somei ) and saves her . He takes her home and puts her into his bathtub where she keeps decomposing , the spreading disease spurting blood and pus . Hideshi Hino's " Guinea Pig 4 : Mermaid in the Manhole " is easily one of the most disgusting horror movies I have ever seen . The make-up effects made by Nobuaki Koga are incredibly revolting . The character of Hayashi is pretty sympathetic and the film has a mood of a very sad romance . The mermaid represents painter's wife and " all the beautiful things " he has lost , so she is bound to rot and vanish too . " Mermaid in the Manhole " works as a piece of extreme art , so anyone who loves Japanese horror should give it a look . However if you're easily offended avoid this one like the plague .
407683	865972	61994	9.0	Truly bizarre Italian giallo .	" Death Laid an Egg " by Giulio Questi is a wonderful giallo full of surrealism . Mark only married his wife Anna because of her chicken fortune . They run a chicken farm between the two of them . Mark has been having several affairs including one with Gabriella . Things start to complicate when Gabriella moves in with Mark and Anna . Gabriella and Mark continue their affair and plot Anna's death . " Death Laid an Egg " is a psychedelic giallo that has to be seen to be believed . The acting by Gina Lollobrigida and Jean-Louis Trintignant is excellent and the score by Bruno Maderna fits the mood perfectly . So if you like weird Italian cinema give this one a look . My other recommendations : " Autopsy " by Armando Crispino and " A Quiet Place in the Country " by Elio Petri .
406848	865972	71292	9.0	Violent and exciting survival thriller .	Three Vietnam war buddies have been given a taste for violence and make a game of torture , rape and hunting humans . They abduct a couple and imprison them in the lodge . After sexual degradation of the woman both victims are set free and hunted down . A father of one of their victims decides to take revenge . " Open Season " is a taut and disturbing survival thriller with enough nastiness to satisfy fans of early 70's exploitation cinema . The screenplay was adapted by author David D . Osborn from his own novel of the same name . The film is exciting , brutal and suspenseful . The characters are well-developed and the scenes of violence are pretty hard hitting . Why this cult classic is not on DVD is beyond me . The same can be said about criminally underrated " Wolf Lake " . .
407705	865972	64369	9.0	An enjoyable gorefest from trash master Andy Milligan .	I remember reading wonderful Stephen King's book " Danse Macabre " about horror movies-and this famous writer totally trashed this film . He called it " an idiot's delight " or something like that . I wouldn't go so far to call " The Ghastly Ones " a masterpiece , but I found it immensely enjoyable . Of course the acting is rather bad and the budget is extremely low , but the gore scenes are amazing . I loved especially the scene when one guy is butchered in the cellar-I suppose Hershell Gordon Lewis would be proud . What else I liked ? Hmm , the hunchback is an extremely funny and grotesque character . I laughed my ass off when he killed a rabbit . - check out this cheap and gory horror , if you like low-budget grindhouse fare .
407867	865972	296042	9.0	Excellent mix of sadistic violence and humour .	Takashi Miike's " Ichi the Killer " is a masterpiece of insane cinema . This film is surely challenging-filled with enough sadistic violence and rape to satisfy fans of Japanese harrowing cinema . It's based on the popular manga by Hideo Yamamoto . The character of Ichi is truly amazing-he is a mysterious figure who slices various individuals into numerous bloody pieces with razor sharp blades strapped to his boots . The gore is pretty extreme as Ichi literally slices people in half with his razor-sharp boots . The acting is surprisingly good-Nao Omori and Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Ichi and Kakihara . Highly recommended , especially if you have strong stomach . .
408048	865972	378760	10.0	Very creepy Italian horror film .	Ivan Zuccon's " The Shunned House " has been made quite cheaply and has Italian actors talking in English with partly atrocious accents . Still I enjoyed it very immensely and I'd recommend " La Casa Sfugitta " to anyone interested in Italian horror . The film is based on three short stories by H . P . Lovecraft and it features really haunting sequences and some disturbingly violent moments like throat slashing with a razor . Another plus is that " The Shunned House " is visually stunning and easily captures extremely dark atmosphere that Lovecraft is so famed for . Many horror fans trashed this eerie flick , but I really don't understand why . Give this movie a chance and you won't be disappointed . My rating : .
407596	865972	972883	10.0	The best adaptation of Jack Ketchum's novel so far .	Jack Ketchum's brilliant novel tells the story of an elderly man Avery Ludlow , who has a dog named Red he loves more than life . A simple lonely man he has few good things in his life after losing family members tragically years before . On the day he takes his dog fishing with him , three young boys come along , rob him and shoot his dog for no reason . After this cold-blooded murder he tries to seek justice , but two of the boys are coming from a rich and powerful family . Each thing he tries is thwarted until he takes matters into his own hand . The climatic outburst of violence is inevitable . . . " Red " is a slow-moving and meditative drama punctuated with sudden explosions of violence . The acting by Brian Cox is phenomenal , the supporting cast is also splendid . Overall , " Red " is a sad and beautiful story about a man and his dead dog . Thank You very much Lucky McKee and Trygwe Aliester Disen for such powerful piece of work . I have seen " The Girl Next Door " and " The Lost " , but " Red " is the best adaptation of Ketchum to date . I'm glad that I saw it in the cinema during 2008 Warsaw Film Festival .
408009	865972	87805	10.0	Brilliant trash !	Sam Firstenberg's " Ninja 3 : The Domination " mixes martial arts with " The Exorcist " like horror . The horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable , but the film works as a mindless action / martial arts flick . The fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting , and the film is never boring . So forget stupid dialogue , lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out ! Highly recommended !
408067	865972	80040	10.0	Very creepy horror film .	" Tourist Trap " is a genuinely spooky low-budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans . It contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear . Some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when Chuck Connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls off . There is very little gore , but the violence is quite strong for PG-rated horror film . The mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying . David Schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including " Crawlspace " , " Puppet Master " and " Netherworld " . Still " Tourist Trap " is definitely his best horror film , so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look . .
406996	865972	454841	10.0	Brutal , savage and unrelenting - the way horror film should be .	A family on their way to California come across a rundown gas station in the middle of the New Mexico desert . They then think they're taking a shortcut through the hills , thanks to the kindly suggestion of the gas attendant , but find themselves stranded in the middle of no where . And to make things worse , the whole thing was a trap so a group of deformed mutants can butcher and eat them . " The Hills Have Eyes " remake was made by Alexandre Aja , the guy behind " Haute Tension " . It offers plenty of nasty violence and gore , several scenes with nail-biting tension and a few solid scares . One of the most radical departures from Wes Craven's original is to give the cannibals back-stories . In the 2006 movie , they are miners who were deformed by the radiation fallout from 1940s and 1950s nuclear testing . The trailer attack sequence is wonderfully audacious and the violence is brutal and bloody . Aja manages to unsettle the viewer few times , such as when he intercuts the burning alive of the family matriarch Bob with the suggested rape of younger daughter Brenda . The mutant and gore effects by Howard Berger and Gregory Nicotero are excellent and the photography of the desert landscape is great . A must-see for fans of intense survival horror !
407995	865972	113303	10.0	Excellent horror / thriller !	I've seen earlier Brett Leonard's horror film " The Dead Pit " ( 1989-check out my comment of it ! ) and this director is incredibly overlooked and talented . " Hideawy " is excellent-fast-paced , violent and really dark . The visuals ( especially the vision of Hell ) are really impressive , and Jeremy Sisto as a satanic killer Vassago is outstanding-he is pure evil ! Great soundtrack bu such industrial / metal bands like KMFDM , Fear Factory , Godflesh ( " Nihil " - I love this song ! ) and Front Line Assembly . My absolute recommendation .
407379	865972	230600	10.0	" This house is ours . "	This creepy and uncanny horror movie has to be one of the best horror films of 2001 . It's an old-fashioned haunted house film which reminds me such movies like " House on Haunted Hill " ( 1958 ) , " The Haunting " ( 1963 ) , " The Turn of the Screw " ( 1992 ) or " The Woman in Black " ( 1989 ) . The acting is excellent ( kudos for Nicole Kidman-she is brilliant ! ) , the music by Alejandro Amendbar perfectly sets the mood , and the atmosphere is deliciously creepy . Add to this a number of really effective shocks and we have a winner . Instead of computer graphics and gore we get suspense and incredible tension . The ending is extremely surprising ! - a masterpiece !
407442	865972	165623	10.0	Extremely brutal , disturbing and nihilistic serial killer film .	Gerald Kargl's " Angst " is one of the most depressing and disturbing serial killer movies ever made . It's loosely based on an actual crime case-in 1980 Werner Kniesek from Salzburg horrendously murdered three people . Later he told the judge " I just love it when women shiver in deadly fear because of me . It is like an addiction , which will never stop " . " Angst " is often compared to John McNaughton's " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " , but it's even more unsettling and hopeless . The film is shot with a strong use of high-angle shots and hand-held camera-work . It tells the story of disorganized serial killer , who is released from prison . First he tries to strangle the female taxi driver , but she manages to kick him out of the car and escapes . The killer flees through the forest until he reaches a huge villa , where the family of three lives . In the orgy of extreme violence he murders them . A disabled and mentally retarded son on wheelchair is slowly drowned in a bathtub in a truly agonizing sequence , a middle-aged mother is strangled in her bedroom and finally her adolescent daughter is stabbed to death with a bread-knife . The killer viciously mutilates her corpse and rapes her post-mortem . All of this is shown in unflinching detail that made me squirm . " Angst " is a hauntingly realistic portrayal of disorganized serial killer on the loose . This disturbed guy is a serious threat to every human being crossing his path . Erwin Leder as the killer is incredibly convincing . The murder sequences are so savage and shocking that you'll need an iron stomach to watch them . The camera work by Zbigniew Rybczynski is simply stunning and the film looks like semi-documentary . " Angst " is easily one of the most gut-wrenching serial killer flicks I have ever seen . It makes " The Silence of the Lambs " and " Seven " look like kindergarten stuff . Highly recommended , but not for the easily disturbed . .
407990	865972	71519	10.0	One of my favourite horror films from Hammer .	I love all Hammer horror films simply because they are a part of my childhood . " Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell " is great-the acting is really good and the film is quite scary in a subtle way . Peter Cushing as a Baron Victor Frankenstein / Dr Claus Victor is as always amazing , and Dave Prowse is very believable as an ugly monster . There's a bit of gore , which is quite unusual for Hammer horror . Fans of " Scream " and similar teen-oriented garbage won't like this one-you have to be a true horror fan to fully appreciate this film . However if you like old-fashioned horror , give this one a look .
407579	865972	82592	10.0	Possibly the best backwoods slasher ever made .	Jeff Lieberman's " Just Before Dawn " is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made . The film , whilst a little bit influenced by " Deliverance " and " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " , is extremely creepy and memorable . The suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie . The cast is excellent , Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female leads . The inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers . The film is beautifully shot-it was actually filmed on location at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon . There is very little gore , but one killing , when Verchel is stabbed in the groin , is pretty nasty and unpleasant . A must-see for slasher fans . - what else ?
407852	865972	190232	10.0	People are just imperfect corpses .	Katsuya Matsumura's " All Night Long 3 " is pretty much on the same level with " All Night Long 2 " ( 1995 ) , and has the most pessimistic tone of the whole series as it suggests that humans are nothing but filth and rubbish . Kikuo is a Japanese boy who works in a sleazy hotel where men bring women for sex . One day he takes bag which contains a woman's personal items that she has thrown away . Becoming increasingly interested , he starts obsessively collecting her refuse . " All Night Long 3 " is by far the most extreme of the three films and the hardest to watch . The violence is extremely graphic in this part and comes sudden and shocking to hit the viewer numb . Some scenes like a brutal torture , murder and dismemberment of a young Japanese girl are truly sickening . All in all if you liked the first two " All Night Long " films give this one a look . Recommended !
406818	865972	81248	10.0	Excellent zombie film-one of the best of its kind !	" Burial Ground " is perhaps the sickest and sleaziest of Italian zombie gut munchers of the eighties ! Andrea Bianchi's film is filled with extreme gore , bad acting and lame music , but the most outrageous thing is the small boy character of one of the elders , as these two , mother ( played by beautiful Mariangela Giordano ) and son ( Peter Bark ) have a very unusual relationship together . The boy has a sexual lust for his mother and it results in one of the nastiest death scenes in the history of zombie movies . The gore is extreme with lots of gut munching-for example one victim has her head slowly pulled towards a broken window to have the shards of glass stick into their face . Still my favourite gore scene is near the end-after the young kid Michael is killed , he returns as a zombie and bites off Mariangela Giordano's nipple ! The dialogue is extremely funny-like the classic lines " Mother , this cloth smells of death " and " Hey , stop [ the zombies ] , I'm your friend " among others ! A must-see for fans of Italian cult cinema . !
407088	865972	161634	10.0	Shocking and disturbing .	The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . She is beaten savagely , spun around in the chair endlessly , has her finger nails pulled , animal guts are thrown at her , hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle ( really sick and nasty scene ) . The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . Of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . I have seen also " Flowers of Flesh and Blood " which is more gory and sadistic , but less disturbing . Anyway , this one is a must-see for horror fans !
