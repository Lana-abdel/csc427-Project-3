407735	865972	122603	1.0	Truly abysmal .	" Legion of Fire : Killer Ants ! " is indeed one of the worst horror films ever made . It's so bad and stupid it has to be seen to be believed . The cast is horrible and the special effects are even worse . I ask the film-makers : what is scary in computer-animated ants ? The only good thing about this piece of crap is beautiful photography . Avoid this pile of garbage like the plague . My rating : - what else ?
407794	865972	89274	1.0	Another proof that Wes Craven is overrated .	Wes Craven-many horror fans consider him as a master of horror , but after watching his truly god-awful movies like " Deadly Friend " , " Invitation to Hell " and this one I came to conclusion that he is very overrated . Only three of his movies are actually worth watching : " Last House on the Left " which is brilliant , " The Hills Have Eyes " and " Deadly Blessing " which are pretty good . His other movies , including overrated " Scream " and " A Nightmare on Elm Street " are a typical Hollywood garbage . " The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 " is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters , who are attacked by cannibals : Pluto ( Michael Berryman ) and his uncle Reaper ( John Bloom ) . Absolutely no suspense , even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks ( although there's a nice throat slashing ) . The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid . The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb , but also hilarious at the same time . Avoid this junk like the plague . Not recommended .
407086	865972	117611	1.0	Total failure .	Recently I saw this piece of crap on the Polish TV and phew ! what a stinker , I can't believe the good reviews people give it here . Michael Rooker , who gave us an incredible performance as Henry Lee Lucas in " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " is totally wasted as a well-armed priest , yeah right ! ! ! While a few effective sequences do exist ( notably the beginning of the movie ) the overall effect is lame . The film resembles me a TV movie and lacks any scares , gore and violence . The acting is alright , I suppose , but these CGI-effects are terrible and the plot is boring . So if you're looking for a good horror movie , then try to avoid this one at all costs .
407510	865972	92669	1.0	Unwatchable garbage .	" Blood Diner " is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies ever made . I couldn't find any merit , any redeeming values in this trash . It's amazing that some people actually like this movie . The story is extremely stupid , the cast is horrid and the music is awful . It's obvious that this is a zero-budget movie , because the special effects are so laughably fake , so inept that I found myself laughing a lot during the film . OK , some people may say " Come down ! This is a Troma picture ! " . Sure , but if they want to make a horror movie , they should make it scary or extremely bloody . " Blood Diner " isn't scary , isn't even gory enough . It's simply a piece of garbage . If you have seen Troma's " Redneck Zombies " and you like that kind of stuff you might even like this trash , as for me , I give up . Not recommended .
408166	865972	357507	2.0	Epitomizes everything what's awful with mainstream American horror .	A young man named Tim is traumatized by memories of terrible events he experienced in his childhood bedroom . Years later he reluctantly returns home to face his fears of a monstrous entity called Boogeyman that could be real or merely a figment of his imagination . Did a Boogeyman really steal his father away from the house all those years ago ? Are his nearest and dearest in danger as the monster returns from the past to haunt the present ? Does anybody want to suffer whilst watching this piece of garbage ? " Boogeyman " is just another lame and politically correct horror film that's not even remotely scary . The film has all the typical horror movie cinematic clichés for example lightning and thunder , silhouetted figures outside in the rain and dead people that talk on screen . The jump scares are irritating and the use of CGI effects is awful . The characters are completely uninteresting and there is absolutely no suspense . Avoid this bloodless piece of junk like the plague . This is surely one of the worst horror films of 2005 .
407712	865972	93614	2.0	Total garbage .	Joseph Merhi's " The Newlydeads " is a textbook example of late 80's slasher . The spirit of a dead drag queen kills honeymoon couples at the lakeside resort where he was murdered . This film is so horrendously bad that it truly has to be seen to be believed . The acting is awful , the suspense is non-existent and there is plenty of cheesy gore . The character of drunken preacher is hilarious . This is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking that they must have intended it to be bad-this couldn't be some sort of accidental mistake . Avoid this one like the plague . .
406976	865972	106666	2.0	Extremely cheap and awful monster movie .	An astronaut gets infected by space spores and turns into one of the stupidest looking creatures I have ever seen . His spaceship crashes in a Florida swamp and the monster quickly begins killing people . There are some hilarious moments in this piece of utter garbage like the attack of armadillo or a worm bursting out of some idiot's neck . There is a decent amount of gore , but the film lacks any scares and features almost no nudity . The plot is bland and the final showdown with an alien is so utterly ridiculous that it defies description . I have seen plenty of awful Z-grade horror flicks in my time and " Dark Universe " is among the worst . It truly reeks . .
406829	865972	84592	2.0	Incredibly awful .	When Dr . Alan Harker travels to the crumbling estate of his university mentor Dr . Usher , he finds the man plagued by a horrible paranoia-destroyed by his repeated attempts at awakening his comatose daughter . Haunted by ghosts of his dead family members , Dr . Usher is rushing toward madness , with only Harker left to save him . I can easily say that I'm a big fan of Jesus Franco , unfortunately " Revenge in the House of Usher " is breathtakingly awful . Those expecting gore and sex in a Eurohorror title ( especially from Franco ) will be sorely disappointed , because there is absolutely no nudity or blood in this one . The pacing is horribly slow and there are a lot of ' flashback ' scenes taken from Franco's earlier horror classic " The Awful Dr . Orloff " . Avoid this piece of stinking crap like the plague .
408108	865972	124307	3.0	Pure crap .	Bill Rebane's " The Capture of Bigfoot " is one of the most awful horror movies ever made . A greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen ( Richard Kennedy ) decides that he wants Bigfoot captured at all costs . However local game ranger Dave Garrett ( Stafford Morgan ) learns that the Bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition , and sets out to protect the creature . There is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap . The film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects . No gore , no suspense-just gigantic boredom . Avoid this horrible junk like the plague .
408086	865972	242998	3.0	Another slickly made teen slasher garbage .	" Valentine " is just another teen slasher from Jamie Blanks , the director of extremely generic " Urban Legend " . It tells the story of five school friends now grown up . One by one the girls start to receive strange cards around Valentine's Day . The cards all bear the same initials and when the girls and the detective get together they all point the finger at a school nerd they knew years ago whom they had all humiliatingly knocked back at the local school dance . From then on in as the girls are killed one by one you are left to work out if is it the school nerd or whether someone else is responsible . " Valentine " is a suspenseless and almost completely bloodless slasher film that literally offers nothing new . The acting is surprisingly flat and the plot heavily borrows from Canadian slasher " My Bloody Valentine " . The script is poorly written , the conversations are all lifeless and dull and as for the plot , it's safe to say you won't find many more stupid than this one . The climax is awful with totally pointless plot twist at the end . The film is slickly made and moderately entertaining , but the lack of gore is hard to forgive . A typical trash for teens , who don't know the genre . . If you want truly grisly and savage piece of horror rent " Haute Tension " .
407873	865972	268307	3.0	What the hell ?	I doubt that the reviewers are reviewing the same film I saw today . Sam-519 from London is obviously reviewing Tamakichi Anaru's porno / pseudo-snuff " Niku Daruma " from 1998 . Maybe Kevlin is reviewing the right film , I ain't sure . However " Flesh Meat Doll 1 : Doll for Pleasure " or perhaps different film left me disappointed . It's a boring and heavily censored optically S & M porno with no gore and violence . Basically a Japanese woman played by Saki Yuri is sexually pleasured and degraded by the driver of a red car . The film looks amateurish , the porno scenes are pixellated and it lacks gore and grisly violence of " Niku Daruma " . Maybe somebody who actually seen all four movies of " Flesh Meat Doll " series will point me at the right direction . - the biggest disappointment I have in years .
406995	865972	250698	4.0	A mediocre voodoo-themed horror film .	Alice Dodgson , a New York doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug , resulting in the patient's death . Without a job , Alice is forced to go to Jamaica , where she tends to the brother of a wealthy white landowner . The brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in the local people's voodoo practices and rituals . " Ritual " is a mediocre horror flick . The action is pretty dull , the plot twists are silly and there is no suspense . There is a bit of gore as someone is killing off white people with a machete , but not too much . The cinematography is decent , however the acting is truly woeful . Definitely one to avoid . .
407629	865972	71754	4.0	Pretty bad soft-core sex comedy .	There is nothing even remotely interesting or particularly arousing in this boring piece of soft-core sex trash . The only reason to watch it is lovely Sylvia Kristel from " Emmanuelle " and " Private Lessons " . The sex scenes are strictly soft-core and rather uninteresting . The last sex scene on tennis court in the rain is pretty good , though . The acting is mediocre and the film is loaded with some truly annoying and laughable characters . Sylvia Kristel provides some nudity , but there is not enough T & A for my liking . " Julia " is a pretty obscure film , so if you're a fan of cheerful exploitation you may give it a look . Just don't expect something really arousing , because this film is just average . Watch Joe D'Amato's sleazy sexploitation movies or Walerian Borowczyk's erotic stuff instead . My rating : .
407328	865972	80346	5.0	Hilariously bad and cheap zombie flick .	The premise of " Alien Dead " is that a space-born disease infected a bunch of bayou rednecks and after they finished up all the alligators they start eating the locals . Fred Olen Ray's " Alien Dead " is so bad that it quickly becomes hilarious . The acting is utterly terrible , only veteran actor Buster Crabbe can act . The makeup consists of Halloween masks for the male zombies and the women are mostly leggy hot blonds with white and black face paint . There is also a decent amount of gore including some cannibalistic feasts . I have seen plenty of awful zombie flicks including " The Chilling " , " Zombie Lake " or " Zombie Brigade " and I must say that " Alien Dead " is at least watchable , if you are in the right mood . That's why I give it .
407336	865972	279730	5.0	At least it's marginally better than terrible part VI .	When calls for her eccentric grandmother go unanswered , Jamie Lowell is shocked to discover that her grandmother's last known address is a condemned tenement building overrun by murderous children . But as Jamie slowly uncovers the truth behind her grandmother's mysterious disappearance , she merely disturbs a powerful evil that now seeks to destroy Jamie as well ! First of all I'm not a fan of " Children of the Corn " series , however the description on the back of my tape sounded good enough to watch this film . Guy Magar's " Children of the Corn : Revelation " lacks gore and scares and is filled with huge plot holes . Still the location sets are suitably atmospheric-the hallways are dark and slimy looking . Unfortunately the ridiculous climax truly got on my nerves . Overall , this isn't the best in the " Children of the Corn " franchise , but it sure is better than horrible part 6 .
407376	865972	70198	5.0	Obscure horror from South Africa .	The title of this film is very misleading , because there are no zombies here . This South African horror deals with science and magic . The script is actually decent , but the film is really boring and dull , and there's no gore at all . To be fair , there are two or three suspenseful scenes , and the ending is quite exciting-this is enough for me to classify " House of the Living Dead " as a decent horror film , so I'll give it .
407095	865972	104511	5.0	Pretty funny .	" Innocent Blood " is an unusual mix of comedy , gangster movie and gory horror . Anne Parrilaud is a vampire with a strong appetite for blood . She turns to Italians as her next food source . The film has some great moments of humour , and there is plenty of cheesy gore and violence . The eye effects are outstanding and the film is well-written and doesn't fall into too many vampire cliches . It's also notable because of the short appearances of Tom Savini , Sam Raimi , Dario Argento and Linnea Quigley . Worth a look , if you want to be entertained !
407804	865972	140581	5.0	Terrible .	Francis Teri's " The Suckling " is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made . It's sleazy , disgusting and incredibly stupid , so fans of trash cinema won't be disappointed . This time the monster in this movie is created when a teenage couple go to the whorehouse for an abortion . The fetus is flushed whole down the toilet and lands in the sewer , right beneath the leak from a barrel of toxic waste . The small embryo becomes a hideous monster , who promptly starts killing people . . . This hilariously awful horror film has to be seen to be believed . The acting is horrid , the special effects are downright horrible and the sound is weak . Still there is plenty of gore and nudity and the climax is pretty creepy and rather sick . So if you're a fan of trashy low-budget monster movies give this one a look . .
406880	865972	100528	5.0	An average fare .	The miners discover strange runestone in the mine . The runestone is transported to New York . Not long after that an archaeologist Martin Almquist , while studying a discovery , cuts his finger and becomes a blood-thirsty monster . This creature-on-the-loose flick isn't very good , but isn't completely bad either . The film tries to be scary and exciting at the same time , some lines are also pretty funny . No gore at all-for me the lack of blood is disappointing . The acting is acceptable , the monster is creepy looking and kills so many cops that it has to be seen to be believed . Good for the rainy day , just don't expect anything special . My rating : .
407605	865972	161633	5.0	Just average .	I have seen all " Guinea Pig " movies and " Android of Notre Dame " is surely nothing special . It's definitely not as shocking as " Devil's Experiment " or " Flowers of Flesh and Blood " . There is a reasonable amount of blood and gore , but the action is pretty dull . The film is neither funny nor disgusting . Anyway " Android of Notre Dame " is about Japanese dwarf who is trying to bring his girlfriend back to life by inserting various machine parts into her body . . . So if you're a fan of " Guinea Pig " series give this one a look , just don't expect something really repellent . .
406812	865972	110667	6.0	An enjoyable horror film made for the teenage audience .	" Night of the Demons 2 " is an okay sequel of Kevin Tenney's " Night of the Demons " . At Saint Rita's Catholic college Shirley Fenerty ( Zoe Trilling ) and several friends are banned from attending the school Halloween party for fooling around with boys so decide to hold their own party at Hull House . Several years ago at Hull House some teenagers were killed , all except one girl , Angela ( Amelia Kinkaid ) , whose body was never found . But as the party begins the demonic Angela appears and starts killing people . The film is just average-there are some good gore effects , unfortunately there's no suspense or atmosphere whatsoever . The scene when Zoe Trilling's breasts morph to envelop one character's hand totally cracked me up . So if you're in the mood for a campy horror give this one a look .
408055	865972	83573	6.0	A wall-to-wall Spanish porno sleaze .	A band of kinky perverts kidnap a young heiress and teach her the joys of sexual decadence in this rare psycho sleazefest from Carlos Aured and Sergio Bergonzelli . The hard core Italian language print is definitely one to find as it offers tons of delicious sleaze for example we see women cramming pool cues and switchblades up their hairy vaginas . The film is loaded with lots of rough sex and sexual torture , so fans of dirty exploitation cinema will be pleased . Overall , " Apocalipsis Sexual " is among the nastiest Spanish sexploitation flicks I have ever seen . It makes Wes Craven's " Last House on the Left " and " Late Night Trains " look like kindergarten stuff . So if you are a fan of Lina Romay or Ajita Wilson you can't miss this nasty piece of filth . .
408137	865972	93346	6.0	Fun low-budget gore slasher .	In " Killing Spree " an airplane mechanic becomes so convinced that his wife is as unfaithful to him that he launches an inventive and elaborate campaign to dispatch her numerous lovers , in the most violent , gory and repulsive ways imaginable . The bloody effects rank from pretty good to awful , but if you are a rabid gore fan you will love " Killing Spree " . The gore is plentiful including the scene , where our hero rips open a man's belly with chainsaw and then electrocutes him through his exposed intestines . A couple of the kills are hilariously ludicrous and the scene in which the wife ' gives head ' to her husband's best friend is unlike any horror film moment you've ever seen . The acting is unfirmly awful and the editing is bad , but if you enjoy watching low-budget gore flicks grab some beer and give " Killing Spree " a try .
407668	865972	78300	6.0	Sleazy and dirty giallo - " Giallo a Venezia " is much better .	Barbara Magnolfi plays Ursula , who along with her sister Dagmar checks into a beautiful hotel by the sea in sunny Italy . Soon the guests start to be murdered by an unseen assailant with a dildo . Ursula , being a touch neurotic due to the trauma of her fathers recent death has a bad feeling about the hotel and some of the guests , especially the shady Fillipo , drug addict boyfriend of the hotels resident cabaret star Stella Shining . I must admit that I'm a fan of super sleazy Italian giallos from 70's like " Giallo a Venezia " or " Play Motel " , however " La Sorella di Ursula " is the worst of the bunch . The soft-core sex scenes are quite steamy , each one followed by a murder . Still the film is poorly acted and made . Give it a look , only if you are a fan of Italian sleaze . Enzo Millioni went on to direct only two more films after " La Sorella di Ursula " the most notable being " Fuga Dalla Morte " ( 1989 ) , one of the five films that Lucio Fulci supervised and used the footage from it in " Cat in a Brain " .
408049	865972	422779	6.0	Lots of grue and sexual violence , but where is the plot ?	The plot of " Murder-Set-Pieces " is almost non-existent : a serial killer ( Sven Garret ) is raping and butchering hookers and strippers in Las Vegas . The film itself is more or less a remake of Nick Palumbo's earlier horror film " Nutbag " . It borrows some elements from William Lustig's horror classic " Maniac " too . The cinematography is excellent and the musical score is pretty moody . Unfortunately the lead actor Sven Garret is quite awful as a murderous Neo-Nazi . His constant overacting really get on my nerves . " Murder-Set-Pieces " tries so hard to be disturbing and disgusting that it almost becomes laughable . I have seen tons of extreme stuff including scat , bestiality stuff , some vomiting and underaged gonzo-style misogyny , so I wasn't particularly shocked or disturbed . Really " Murder-Set-Pieces " is nothing in comparison to " Mu Zan E " or " Psycho : The Snuff Reels " . Even such serial killer staples like " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " or Gerald Kargl's " Angst " are much more effective and disturbing . Of course the gore effects by Toe Tag crew are great , but lots of them still appears off-screen . Overall , " Murder-Set-Pieces " is a pretty over-hyped horror film that should only satisfy fans of gore and graphic nudity . Fans of horror films that contain an actual story will be sorely disappointed . and that's being generous .
407714	865972	70622	6.0	Pretty bad .	Bernard L . Kowalski's " SSSSSSS " is an amusing horror cheapie . Kowalski is the director of many B-movies including " Attack of the Giant Leeches " ( 1960 ) and " Night of the Blood Beast " ( 1958 ) . The acting is decent and Strother Martin steals the show as the mad scientist . The use of real snakes is pretty effective , but the script is very mediocre and absurd . The snake man make-up is okay , but the final transformation scene is beyond horrible . " SSSSSSS " is surely good for few laughs , so if you have enough time to kill give it a look . .
407267	865972	120804	6.0	An enjoyable , but completely unscary zombie romp !	" Resident Evil " isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made , but movie of the year ? ! . . . come on ! I'm sad to have say that this is actually more action flick than horror . As cool as the games are ( at least the first two ) , as mediocre is Anderson's film . Almost no gore at all , pretty bad acting ( the characters in the computer game almost seem lively ) and no uncanny atmosphere to be found . And , by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of " Dawn of the Dead " . Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here . There's one reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning . The sequence where several characters are trapped in the bright , shiny corridor with a deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile . The battle between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent . The climax is okay and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel . The film is well-made and looks really nice , but the lack of gore can't be forgiven . However there are better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example " Zombi 2 " , " Burial Ground " , " The Beyond " , Romero's " Living Dead " trilogy , " Flesheater " , " Meat Market " series etc . The game is also a lot more scarier-if you want a really good , albeit forgotten horror film which is quite similar to the first " Resident Evil " game , please check out " Scarecrows " ( 1988 ) .
407706	865972	65480	6.0	Frankly boring .	" Bloodthirsty Butchers " ( what a great title ! ) is possibly Andy Milligan's most famous film . Unfortunately I found it disappointing-I enjoyed his " The Ghastly Ones " ( 1968 ) more . There are some good scenes of splashy gore and butchery , but the rest of the film is overtalked and dull . In my humble opinion Andy Milligan was an underrated filmmaker-I'll definitely check out more of his stuff if I have a chance . - a breast in a pie scene is priceless !
407587	865972	319255	6.0	Obscure and forgotten precursor of " The Fog " .	The zombie ghost of a drowned excursion boat captain Manfred Gohr haunts an Austrian lake in search of vengeance against those who caused the accident . The plot of " Dark Echo " sounds familiar for an avid horror fan . It pretty much reminded me John Carpenter's horror classic " The Fog " . The film offers some atmospheric moments shot in caves and old castles and few interesting underwater shots . The gore is completely absent apart from badly made decapitation of the witch . The acting is decent , but the pace is terribly slow . Still if you are a collector of extremely tough to find European horror films you can give " Dark Echo " a look . I'm also sure that Robotham's debut was released many years ago in Poland on VHS under the title " Mroczna glebia " . .
407967	865972	161849	6.0	Good stuff !	Antonio Climati's " The Green Inferno " is obviously inspired by Ruggero Deodato's unforgettable masterpiece " Cannibal Holocaust " ( 1979 ) . Professor Koranz is missing so 4 individuals ( one woman reporter and three guys ) head off to the Amazon to search for him . They encounter fish that feed on the intestines of live humans , bat attacks , unfriendly headhunters , anacondas and more jungle horrors . " The Green Inferno " is nothing special . It has some rather unpleasant scenes involving animals , but the amount of violence is extremely low . Still if you like Italian exploitation cinema give this obscure little flick a look . However fans of Antonio Climati's downright unpleasant mondo movies will be sorely disappointed . .
407018	865972	76590	6.0	Not as good as " Shivers " and " The Brood " .	A collision between motorcycle and motorhome on a country road leaves Hart Read ( Frank Moore ) and his girlfriend Rose ( Marilyn Chambers ) badly injured . Read is stable enough to be shipped to a hospital , but Rose is shipped to the clinic . The operation to save her life appears at first to be a complete success , but soon all hell breaks loose . Marilyn Chambers is pretty believable as Rose-even Cronenberg was surprised that she didn't do more mainstream movies . The film has some great moments of terror-the shooting of a man trying to get into a car and the immediate washing down of the windshield that follows , is a perfect example . " Rabid " isn't as gruesome as " Shivers " and " The Brood " , but if you are a fan of Cronenberg's movies you can't miss it . Highly recommended .
407406	865972	71439	6.0	Trashy entertainment from Jesus Franco .	Jesus Franco's movies are really strange : on the one hand they're really trashy and brainless , on the other hand they always deliver a good amount of sleaze and are simply fun to watch . " La Venganza del doctor Mabuse " is an enjoyable trashy romp filled with bad acting , sleaze and nudity . The monster is extremely laughable and the characters ( especially those stupid cops ) are very funny . So if you like Franco or Spanish cinema give this one a look .
407876	865972	1047660	6.0	Routine but suitably creepy Indonesian horror flick	Maya and her younger sister Andin are orphans since a year back and have just started to move on with their lives . Maya is getting married to her boyfriend soon and Andin is afraid that Maya will forget about her . To patch things up with her sister , Maya decides to buy Andin her own apartment now that she's starting college and has to take care of herself . What she doesn't know is that the building is haunted and the terrifying ghost starts to haunt Andin . It's a surprise that such derivative horror flick received so many glowing reviews . It obviously borrows from " Shutter " , " Ju-on " , " The Eye " and many other successful Asian horror movies . Admittedly some scenes are pretty creepy , but I wasn't paralyzed with fear . Jaume Balaguero's recent horror hit " Rec " is far more scarier . Still a stark , white and empty apartment building , with claustrophobic rooms and dark shadowy corners and hallways is the perfect setting . .
408078	865972	104112	6.0	Nothing really impressive .	Toru Murakawa's " Distant Justice " is a mediocre action film . Like any self-respecting " Death Wish " clone , it certainly delivers plenty of violence , but there is absolutely no suspense to be found here . Visiting America for the first time with his wife and daughter , Inspector Rio Yuki ( Bunta Sugawara ) discovers how dangerous Boston can be . After Rio's wife inadvertently photographs a drug buy , she is gunned down and his daughter Sakura ( Sakura Sugawara ) is kidnapped . Despite assurances from his police buddy , soon-to-retire Chief Bradfield ( George Kennedy ) Rio decides to take the law into his own hands . The film isn't as bad as its rating suggests-it is just extremely routine and predictable . There is a nice amount of violence ( even gang-rape attempt scene ) , so fans of gritty action movies won't be disappointed . My rating : .
407194	865972	104409	6.0	Unsatisfying .	Clive Barker's " Hellraiser " is an entertaining horror film as is " Hellbound : Hellraiser II " , but I'm going to say that " Hellraiser III : Hell on Earth " is a big disappointment . The film is really boring , but it has some interesting elements . The gore is plentiful and some of the scenes like Pinhead's nightclub massacre truly blew me away . Doug Bradley is excellent as Pinhead , unfortunately these new Cenobites are more laughable than scary . A guy who shoots razor-sharp CD's , another with a camera in his head , and another who breathes fire ? Come on , these villains look more like carnival sideshow freaks than hellish Cenobites . The film is still marginally entertaining , so if you're a fan of " Hellraiser " series give it a look . My rating : .
407303	865972	94262	6.0	Interesting concept , yet mediocre execution .	Steve and Rachel move from New York to a small town . Steve runs a movie rental store and noticed the people in the town are obsessed with violent slasher flicks . One day someone accidentally returns a video of a real life murder . Can it be real or is someone just playing a joke on the towns new residents . They will soon find out and the blood will be shed . It seems that the entire town is involved with psychotic serial killers Howard and Eli in a craven conspiracy to create and distribute their own snuff films . When I was a kid I loved renting tons of gory horror from various rental palaces . Horror is still my life and I'm damn proud of it . " Video Violence " is loaded with cheesy gore , crappy acting and nudity . It brings sweet memories of my gore-soaked childhood . .
407159	865972	116616	7.0	Sex and violence HK style .	" The Imp " is just another of countless cheap HK exploitation flicks made during 90's . Stunningly sexy Pan Dang plays a Hong Kong woman who's traveling in search of her twin sister , who disappeared leaving nothing more than a native doll , the eponymous imp . Along the way she hooks up with a mobile film crew led by Category III veteran Mark Cheng . They discover that something isn't quite right with the boarding house in which they're staying . " The Imp " offers plenty of raunchy sex and the last 15 minutes or so are pretty violent , but the pace is slow and the script is silly . However Pan Dang steals the show with her impressive breasts . Fands of HK sleaze should give this Cat III offering a look .
407426	865972	75814	7.0	Surprisingly obscure and perverse giallo .	A young girl named Edie is mysteriously kidnapped and taken to a country house where she is tied up , stripped and hung from the ceiling by her wrists . She is then tortured and finally killed by a long spear that penetrates her soft flesh Meanwhile the beautiful Margaret just released from a women's prison takes a room at Mrs . Grant's remote country mansion . Soon the strange things begin to happen . . . This sleazy and rather perverse giallo from Ramiro Oliveros is quite similar to Massimo Pupillo's " The Bloody Pit of Horror " . The action is slow and the mystery elements aren't well-handled , but there is enough nudity and misogynistic violence to keep fans of Euroexploitation happy . Give this one a chance . .
407841	865972	95423	7.0	Okay , but nothing memorable !	Kadaicha are ancient Aborigine stones whose hellish curse reaches from beyond the grave . Anyone receiving such a stone is doomed to die in terrifying circumstances . A group of local teenagers are each experiencing the same nightmarish dream about an eerie cave with sinister rock paintings and the brooding evil which dwells within . Each awakens to find an evil stone lying coldly next to them . . . The plot sounds really good , but the film is only decent . There are some gruesome death scenes like the spider sequence in the library , and the score is suitably creepy and menacing . - okay horror film !
407149	865972	325534	7.0	Rather average South Korean horror .	Television producer Han-Soo Jin is covering detective Choi , the main cop on a serial murder case whose victims are all women , with special interest . Choi follows the suspect through a nightclub filled with party goers , with producer Han following with her camera . Suddenly a woman on the dance floor falls to the ground . Han can't believe what she saw through the viewfinder , but during that time the woman has died . She thought she saw ' something ' going inside the woman's body , causing it to swell . The investigating team are drawn deeper into the case by the discovery that all the victims had visited a mysterious website called ' White Room ' . " Unborn But Forgotten " clearly copied many ideas from Japanese horror hit " Ringu " and " FearDotCom " . We've got another killer website which kills women , only this time it takes fifteen days for people to die instead of seven or two . Admittedly the film is well-made with all the high production values I expected from Korean cinema . There are some creepy moments and the soundtrack is wonderful . Unfortunately this is strictly routine stuff , but if you like Asian horror give it a look . .
406763	865972	365513	7.0	Funny and absurd horror comedy with a healthy dose of gore .	Two city guys are driving through Hicksville USA when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road . Having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker , they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees , one of whom warns them of ' the demon out there ' . But they don't listen . Big mistake ! " Monster Man " by Michael Davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well . The film borrows heavily from " Duel " , " The Blair Witch Project " , " Jeepers Creepers " and " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . The story is pretty silly , but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy . I enjoyed especially the performance of Justin Urich , which offers the film its comedy relief . Still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive . Give this one a chance , if you have some time to waste . . Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy ?
407325	865972	74356	7.0	Okay old-fashioned Sasquatch flick .	Pahoo and Rives , two anthropology students from the University of Chicago travel to Oil City in Louisiana to track down Sasquatch . They try to find old-timer Joe Canton , whose best friend was allegedly snatched in the swamps by Sasquatch , but run into a wall of hostility and opposition from the locals . " Creature from the Black Lake " is a Bigfoot flick , unfortunately Sasquatch is rarely seen throughout . Still the rural atmosphere of Louisiana is well-captured , the acting is okay and there is a few suspenseful moments . The downside of this is that the film becomes absorbed by its portrait of a small town to the extent of almost everything else . Still if you are a fan of Bigfoot horror flicks like " Night of the Demon " , " Shriek of the Mutilated " or " Screams of a Winter Night " you may give it a look . .
408167	865972	70116	7.0	Artistic sleaze .	A young woman is interrogated by the police and the judges , suspected of being a modern witch . The girl who shared her apartment has been found dead with a pair of scissors impaled through her heart , as she lay attached to the bedposts . Apparently , the girl does have powers , to make all people around her fall prey to her spell , glissing progressively into desire , lust and the unknown . Alain Robbe-Grillet has to be one of the most innovative French novelists and film-makers . His " Successive Slidings of Pleasure " is a wonderful film that contains plenty of surreal moments and lots of sleaze . The movie itself is truly unique and bizarre , so fans of unusual European art-house exploitation won't be disappointed . So if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works give this one a look . This is my first journey into Alain Robbe-Grillet's visions and I'm highly impressed !
407902	865972	74403	7.0	Satanic porno horror from Zebedy Colt .	" The Devil Inside Her " is set in England in 1826 . Faith loves the gardener Joseph , but her father forbids it . Faith's sister Hope lusts after Joseph and sells her souls to the Devil to get Jospeh for herself . Zebedy Colt was the director of several truly depraved porno roughies including " Sex Wish " and " Unwilling Lovers " . " The Devil Inside Her " is also a pretty twisted film with rather interesting plot . Still the hard core sex scenes in this one are slightly disappointing-they are very short and sometimes unerotic . Still there is plenty of vaginal sex with blow jobs , both female and male masturbation , lesbianism and sexual orgies . The location sets are great as they add to the overall mood of the film . So if you enjoyed " Sex Wish " or Alex De Renzy's " Femmes de Sade " you may give this porno horror a try . .
407447	865972	397065	7.0	Fast-paced and amusing horror flick .	" House of Wax " is an above-average horror flick that certainly shows some imagination . Carly and her boyfriend , Wade , have hit the road with a four of their friends to attend a championship college football game ; while camping out for the night , the gang makes the mistake of getting on the wrong side of a mysterious local redneck , and the next morning they discover that Wade's car no longer works . As the others continue on to the big game , Carly and Wade make their way into the closest town , Ambrose , and discover it's all but deserted , except for a local tourist attraction , the House of Wax . However , it isn't long before they find out why the wax sculptures at the museum look so incredibly real , and discover a pair of murderous brothers are keen on making them part of the next exhibit . " House of Wax " is a routine slasher flick that is aimed to the teenage audience . This is actually a remake of the 1953 Andre de Toth 3-D horror classic about corpses turned into wax figures , which was itself a remake of Michael Curtiz's neglected 1933 two-strip Technicolor masterwork " The Mystery of the Wax Museum " . The acting is average with the exception of Paris Hilton , who is painfully bad as slutty Paige . Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra manages to create some eerie visual images : the interior of the wax museum is appropriately creepy and the climactic scene therein is well worth waiting for . There is a little bit of genuine tension and lots of fast cuts and extreme close-ups . There are some surprisingly gory death scenes including knifings , finger cuttings and decapitations , so I was pleased . Overall , if you are a fan of slasher flicks give this one a look , just don't expect too much . .
407666	865972	97942	7.0	Occasionally amusing and gruesome Indonesian horror .	An American woman named Cathy asks her Indonesian boyfriend Hendra to help her investigate Balinese black magic known as ' Leyak ' . Leyak is the most powerful black magic there is and she soon begins to pay a terrible cost when she turns into a flying head that feasts on unborn babies . I have seen my share of crazy Indonesian horror cinema and " Mystics in Bali " is perhaps the most known of ' em all . It is based on Indonesian mythology and for a supernatural culture largely undiscovered by Western movie fans . The special effects are incredibly cheesy and inept , the dubbed dialogue is absolutely hilarious , still there's a flying head which has the body's internal organs trailing behind , along with a little foetus eating and an evil sorcerer for all of you fans of Indonesian trash . The main actress Llona Agathe Bastian is incredibly wooden-in fact she was never an actress at all , but a German tourist spotted in Bali by one of the producers . Give this amusing trash a look . .
407737	865972	95812	7.0	Typical Italian horror film .	" Paganini Horror " isn't a masterpiece , but it is a solid horror flick that will keep almost all horror fans entertained . The acting , apart from Daria Nicolodi ( " Deep Red " , " Tenebre " ) and Donald Pleasance ( " Phenomena " , " Halloween " ) , is pretty bad and the rock music is extremely cheesy and annoying . Director Luigi Cozzi ( " Il Gatto Nero " ) desperately tries to create some spooky atmosphere and , in my opinion , he partially succeeds . The film is full of rich , glowing colors , and the gore effects are pretty well-done ( for example nasty head explosion , violin stabbings etc ) . All in all I really enjoyed this one , so check it out for yourself .
406963	865972	90322	7.0	Violent and controversial Italian horror flick .	Franco Prosperi's " The Wild Beasts " is a fairly routine Italian horror flick about nature gone nuts . The real animals were used in this movie and in many cases killed just for the sake of this Italian shocker . The animal attack scenes are very gory , but the photography by Franco Delli Colli is too murky . The use of animals in " The Wild Beasts " is quite stunning , unfortunately the acting is truly horrible . Still it's nice to see Lorraine De Selle of " Cannibal Ferox " and " House on the Edge of the Park " fame in the main role as a professor . There is also a really tense sequence where a cheetah chases a VW bug down the road and a scene where some rats are burned off a windshield in slow motion . So if you are a fan of Italian horror cinema give this one a look . .
407475	865972	439015	7.0	Surreal , bizarre and often repulsive .	Directed by Japanese underground legend Yoshihiko Matsui , most famous for his epic film " Noisy Requiem " , and his early work with maverick Japanese director Sogo Ishii , " Pig Chicken Suicide " is a veritable assault on the senses , mixing violent images of animal butchery , racial strife and surrealism to tell the story of two Koreans living in Japan , who's love is destroyed due to overwhelming racial discrimination . This seriously bizarre and demented film tells the story of a weird guy , who thinks that he's a chicken and works in a slaughterhouse . He eats dirt , walks like a chicken and masturbates whilst seeing Japanese woman touching herself . " Pig Chicken Suicide " is a gross art-house Japanese piece of sleaze that is as dirty as they come . I enjoyed this demented little flick and you should too , if you like surreal and off-beat cinema . Check it out in pair with Thierry Zeno's " Wedding Trough " for some wonderful sickness . .
407678	865972	104115	7.0	An enjoyable fantasy from Full Moon .	Two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension , one ( Brian Thompson as a Kabal ) trying to destroy the Earth , the other ( Jeffrey Combs as a Anton Mordrid ) trying to save it . " Doctor Mordrid " is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese . The plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent , but the film is very short and entertaining . So if you have enough time to kill give this one a look . My rating : .
407012	865972	71233	7.0	Pretty funny . ( Spoilers )	Paul Morrissey's " Blood for Dracula " is definitely a cult classic . Udo Kier is excellent as a Dracula . He can't suck the blood of anyone but a virgin or he vomits . In one outrageous scene he licks the blood of a virgin off the floor . The film is about as sleazy and politically incorrect as you can get . There is plenty of soft-core sex in this one plus incredibly gory climax when Dracula is dismembered . There is also a lovely cameo by Roman Polanski ( " Rosemary's Baby " , " The Tenant " ) . Check it out in pair with its companion piece " Flesh for Frankenstein " ( 1974 ) .
406990	865972	371949	7.0	Another Daisuke Yamanouchi's sickie .	" Girl Hell 1999 " aka " Injured Murder Rape Film " is another nasty film from Daisuke Yamanouchi's oeuvre . I own this sickie in Japanese , so the plot is not fully understandable for me , but here we go : a girl enjoys riding her bike and she meets a homeless lady in a field who is breastfeeding a doll ( actual milk comes out ) . One day she comes back home and she sees her father raping her mother who is bandaged almost head to toe . A rich pervert is stalking her and she encounters two teenagers on a murder and rape rampage . Japanese exploitation director Daisuke Yamanouchi specializes in making obscure and very nasty pinku eiga oriented films filled with sadistic rape and sexual abuse . " Girl Hell 1999 " has a feeling of " Red Room " movies and " Mu Zan E " as it offers plenty of nihilism . An interesting curio for fans of ero gro . All others should avoid it . .
407345	865972	350774	7.0	Very enjoyable gore flick with lots of humorous moments .	A group of friends on their way to a wedding get lost in the vast Midwest , and are forced to stop for the night in the quiet little town of Lovelock . The friendly innkeeper , Mr . Wise ( David Carradine ) , shows them their rooms then promptly drops dead the next day , forcing the group to stay in town during the investigation . But while the local sheriff does his work , a mysterious force sweeps the town , turning its residents into murderous zombies . " Dead and Breakfast " is a vastly entertaining zombie flick filled with amusing jokes and gore . The make-up effects are some of the best I have ever seen , especially when Erik Palladino is dancing around with a chainsaw grinding into his neck , or when the top half of a zombie's head is removed . The combination of humour , gore , and good old fashioned zombie horror gloss make " Dead & Breakfast " one of the finest horror films of 2004 . The cast is okay and the action is never dull . If you enjoyed " Evil Dead 2 " or " Braindead " give this film a chance . .
407675	865972	106335	7.0	Great arthouse drama .	Peter Greenaway is one of the most unique directors at work in cinematic arthouse today . He made several truly original movies like " The Falls " ( 1980 ) , " A Zed and Two Noughts " ( 1985 ) , " The Pillow Book " ( 1997 ) etc . " The Baby of Macon " is pretty demented with the scenes of cannibalism , incest , rape and gore . The film is difficult , challenging , brutal and darkly beautiful . A baby is born from a supposed virgin woman , so a chain of hysteria about divine intervention in the birth takes place . The scene when stunningly beautiful Julia Ormond is gang-raped is really hard to watch-it is not graphic , but her agonizing screams are quite convincing . Highly recommended if you want to see totally challenging piece of art .
407840	865972	131496	7.0	Bruno Mattei's sleazefest !	Caesar Neron indulges himself in any known debauchery including incest with his mother when his Empire slowly declines . Bruno Mattei's " Nerone e Poppea " isn't as outrageous as Joe D'Amato's " Caligula-The Untold Story " , but still offers some delicious sleaze . There's plenty of nudity and some nicely filmed lesbian sequences to keep fans of Italian sleaze entertained . Rudy Adams is wonderfully over-the-top as a crazy Neron and Patricia Derek is one of the sexiest women ever ! There's even a castration scene and some rather nasty torture sequences . The film is long out of print , but you might run into it in a very old video store . A must-see for fans of sleaze !
407280	865972	118652	8.0	Interesting , yet confusing horror film .	When Trevor Blackburn awoke from a coma , he had no memory of his past . In search for answers , he breaks into the secret attic with another patient , as the others are being killed one by one . A darkly sinister doctor played by a horror regular Jeffrey Combs informed him that he'd been committed to a sanitarium for the criminally insane for the sacrificial murder of his fiancée . Thrown into a bizarre halfway house filled with strange psychos he plunges into a violent world of magic , nightmares , wild sexual escapades and torturous medical experiments . The above synopsis on the back of my tape sounded pretty good , so I finally decided to check this film out . " The Attic Expeditions " is a pretty unusual horror flick . It contains a decent amount of violence and nudity . The plot is interesting as it showcases plenty of unique twists and turns , but in the end becomes extremely confusing . .
407338	865972	384537	8.0	Pretty effective adaptation of " Silent Hill " video game series .	In this rather faithful adaptation , mother Rose ( Radha Mitchell ) takes daughter Sharon ( Jodelle Ferland ) to the ghostly town of Silent Hill . It is a town with a daemonic past that harbors a dark secret at its burning core . After Sharon is captured by a fanatical cult , Rose must make a pact with evil to get her back . " Silent Hill " is a pretty good horror film that packs a few creepy moments and offers a nicely ambiguous conclusion . The town of Silent Hill looks very eerie and the periods of darkness are ominous . Visually " Silent Hill " is seriously great ; well-directed and with gruesome effects that resulted in some disturbing imagery . The environments and sets for Silent Hill itself are quite creepy and interesting , and true to the game . Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional , the scares are almost completely absent and there is only a little bit of gore . Still the monsters look amazing and a couple of killings are truly gruesome . However the script by Roger Avary is rather mediocre and the dialogue becomes increasingly worse as the story goes on . Overall , " Silent Hill " is a vast improvement over such horrible adaptations of video games like " Doom " or " House of the Dead " , but as a fan of " Silent Hill " games I expected more . .
406986	865972	76023	8.0	Racist and politically incorrect rape and revenge film .	Three escaped convicts led by racist Jessie Lee Kane head across the state line in a stolen car . They conduct a convenience store robbery where they shoot the owner and take black woman Corrie Turner hostage . They drive to her place where they take the Turner family prisoner as they sit down to Sunday dinner . There the gang proceed to torture , rape and racially abuse the family . This blacksploitation version of " Last House on the Left " is worth checking out especially for insane William Sanderson's performance as Kane . His racial hatred and use of racial insults can be pretty hard to stomach for non-exploitation fans . The scene of a young boy , who has his head bashed in with a rock by Chinese criminal is also pretty brutal and disturbing . It's a shame that " Fight for Your Life " was the last film Robert A . Endelson would ever get to make .
407557	865972	808276	8.0	Pretty creepy Norwegian slasher .	It's midwinter . Five youngsters are heading for the Jotunheimen mountain area to go snowboarding . On the slope , one of them has a bad fall and breaks a leg . There is no sign of any other people around and their mobile phones are out of range . They catch sight of a mountain hotel in the distance and decide to find shelter there . The hotel lies emtpy and silent , obviously closed down years ago . The phone lines are dead and the youngsters realize they have to spend the night in the hotel . Unbeknownst for them there is somebody else in the building-somebody thirsty for their blood . . . Pretty eerie Norwegian slasher with truly creepy looking killer . The director Roar Uthaug manages to create few moments of suspense and terror . There is very little gore and the motivation of the killer is fairly silly , but if you want to be scared give " Cold Prey " a look .
406929	865972	85928	8.0	An enjoyable early 80's HK possession flick .	An insane man is shot dead by two cops , Kung and Hsiao , after he refused to listen to them and tried to kill a woman . After that , the two cops have to deal with the ghosts and Hsiao's girlfriend is haunted as well . . . " Possessed " by David Lai is an enjoyable HK possession flick . The film is not as intense and gruesome as " Flesh and the Bloody Terror " or " Calamity of Snakes " , but the skinning sequence is quite nasty and memorable . Throw in also some unwarranted sex scenes , ghostly rape and a requisite battling back against the spirits and you got yourself a fairly good time despite . " Possessed " is available separately or bundled together with the sequel , unfortunately the regarded " Possessed II " is quite heavily cut compared to other Hong Kong video versions . .
407385	865972	67732	8.0	Very stylish Spanish shocker .	" Cannibal Man " by Eloy de la Iglesia is a notorious Spanish shocker about slaughterhouse worker named Marcos . He works in a canning plant attached to the local slaughterhouse . One night , he kills a taxi driver in self defense and then strangles his girlfriend , the only witness to the crime . Desperate with fear , he murders several other people . " Cannibal Man " is a slow-paced Spanish shocker that contains some graphic gore . The film is also extremely stylish and the atmosphere of decay and frustration is simply overwhelming . It certainly gained some notoriety as a former video nasty in the UK , but it's nowhere nearly as explicit as for example Lucio Fulci's gorefests . However the most interesting fact is that Eloy de la Iglesia was one of the major directors to push Spanish censorship boundaries with this film and a number of powerful gay-oriented films like " El Diputado " or " Los Placeres Ocultos " . So if you are a fan of Spanish horror give it a try . .
407274	865972	475584	8.0	Shocking and disturbing stuff .	" First Transmission " is a deeply unsettling compilation video that features several films made by The Temple ov Psychick Youth . It's about 6 hours long , it has the ' satanic abuse and murder ' on it , a bunch of interviews , some ritual pornography , footage of People's Temple leader Jim Jones , Psychic TV on BBC2 , and truly sick quasi-snuff film called " Castration Movie " . " Psychic TV Vol . 1 " for example contains " The Ritual ov Psychick Youth " which documents a brutal and sadistic TOPY initiation ritual . We see a bound man whipped , drugged , ritualistically mutilated with a knife and smeared with his own blood . Then he is given a blood enema . This forty minutes long video is truly disturbing as it's obviously real with no special effects involved . Its sheer power to shock and disturb resulted in labelling Genesis P . Orridge as a Satanist . On the other hand , " Psychic TV Vol . 2 " features incredibly upsetting ' snuff ' video " Castration Movie " . A disclaimer in which claims that the following footage is being investigated by the FBI for acts of actual violence and mutilation , as well as the exploitation of children . The video then begins and you can kind of tell it was made in the mid maybe late 70's by the clothing and cars . It is grainy mostly looking like it was shot on a home camera of some sort . Two men are apparently making the video , one a doctor of some sort and a cameraman whom we never see . " Castration Movie " documents the two men setting up shop in a local motel and eventually persuading young boys to come to the motel room where they have some sort of miniature steel rod inserted in their arms . This rod apparently acts like a conductor of some sort to which they can then apply live wires to , to achieve some sort of electrical induced orgasm . The video then cuts for about 20 minutes of clipped footage of these boys using the new implants in different locations . Finally one of them in the motel room uses it too much and dies . The doctor freaks out , starts waving his hands around for the camera to cut which it does . The next scene is the doctor driving and the cameraman filming the road , and they apparently are splitting town crossing the Mexican border . Finally it shows them setting up shop in a Mexican hotel then it cuts to graphic scene of a young boy surgically castrated . Personally I don't know what to think about this extremely disturbing video . It appears to be real , but I strongly believe that some parts of it are cleverly simulated . On " Psychic TV Vol . 2 " there is also a propaganda documentary " Disaptches " about the rise of Satanism in UK . It claims that Psychic TV's " First Transmission " tape was a Satanic ritual and TOPY was responsible for murdering children . According to Genesis P . Orridge himself , a fundamentalist lawyer in Liverpool had convinced a couple of mental patients to relocate to a Christian safe house in the North of England where , through various methods including sleep deprivation they would confess to involvement in a Satanic cult , in this case TOPY . Overall , as a collector of extreme cinema I was quite pleased with " First Transmission " videos . However this stuff is definitely not for the easily shocked .
407371	865972	87247	8.0	Decent thriller .	A psycho killer is slashing beautiful strippers in New York . Tom Berenger tries to stop him ! " Fear City " is pretty good , but it's obvious that scenes of violence were heavily cut . It's really a shame , I'd love to see an uncut version . The urban setting of New York and the whole story reminds me a little bit " Maniac " ( 1980 ) and " The New York Ripper " ( 1982 ) . There's plenty of sleaze and tons of nudity ( even Melanie Griffith is naked in a couple of scenes ! ) . So if you like Abel Ferrara movies ( " Ms 45 " , " Driller Killer " ) check out this vastly underrated film .
407068	865972	470967	8.0	Pretty good South Korean ghost story .	" Voice " tells the story of Young-uhn , who one day wakes up dead . Her ghost haunts her high-school ground . Only her best friend , a school DJ named Seon-min can hear her voice . Aided by the school's resident psychic girl , Seon-min attempts to uncover the terrifying mystery behind her friend's death . The fourth installment of " Whispering Corridors " series is an interesting horror film . The film seriously lacks scares , but it more than makes up for it with relying on suspense , mystery and drama . The acting is great , the piano score is absolutely brilliant and the cinematography is flawless . " Voice " is basically just a sad and solemn story that attempts to show what a spirit might feel in the first days after its body has died . Give it a look . .
407144	865972	92254	8.0	Truly raw and violent shocker .	" Her Venegeance " is easily one of the darkest HK films I have seen . The film is as great as I expected . Very dark and merciless and surprisingly anti-violent in its theme after all which is of course great thing and makes the film much more noteworthy piece of work . The violence is raw and the inhuman rape scene is shot in dark cemetery with incredibly dark blue lightning so the scene is as strong and intense as they come . Also veteran actor the late great Lam Ching Ying does a great role as a wheelchair bound uncle who first tries to make the protagonist forget her thoughts about revenge but after all starts to prefer revenge himself , too , and after that , the hell is on the loose and the final bloodbath is very insane again . Among the greatest HK dark thrillers of all time . So if you are a fan of extreme Asian cinema give this gem a look . .
408142	865972	284929	8.0	Pretty good serial killer flick , but I didn't find it too disturbing .	Ted Bundy was one of the most infamous serial killers in the criminal history of US . He murdered numerous young women across the United States between 1974 and 1978 . His total number of victims is unknown . After over a decade of vigorous denials , Bundy eventually confessed to over 30 murders . Matthew Bright's " Ted Bundy " is based on his gruesome activities . Technically the movie is very good and on the most part , the actors are really convincing , but " Ted Bundy " is nowhere near as shocking and disturbing as " Henry : Portait of a Serial Killer " or my personal cult favourite " Angst " . Horror fans might get a kick out of this one because Tom Savini does the special effects makeup and has a small part in the film . Overall , I enjoyed this film and you should too , if you are into exploitation cinema . .
407929	865972	298130	8.0	Nowhere nearly as creepy as the original - " Ringu " , but still pretty good .	" The Ring " directed by Gore Verbinski is based on the Japanese shocker " Ringu " ( 1998 , Hideo Nakata ) . The film actually has more dramatic elements than the original , which is pure horror ! Still Verbinski creates some really suspenseful moments-unlike many directors he realizes that what an audience imagines is far more frightening that what's on screen . The acting is excellent ( Naomi Watts is brilliant and really compelling ! ) , there are some very interesting visuals and eerie moments . Still this film is not as scary as Hideo Nakata's masterpiece . A nice try ! . Recommended !
407830	865972	371945	8.0	Absolutely nasty and extreme Japanese shocker .	" Red Room 2 " is a continuation of the same theme from " Red Room " albeit with new players . Again there are some truly twisted scenes of sadism , gore and sexual violence for example a guy gets his nasal passages scrubbed with a toothbrush for minutes on end until blood erupts everywhere or in a truly repulsive scene a guy who is fisting one of the females in the cage feels something inside her . He grabs hold and pulls with all his strength , wrenching a three inch long fetus and yards of umbilical chord ! So if you liked " Red Room " you won't be disappointed with this piece of nihilism . I still think that Daisuke Yamanouchi's " Mu Zan E " is a much better film . Give it a look as well .
407298	865972	77247	8.0	A bad taste extravaganza .	Joel M . Reed's " Blood Sucking Freaks " is a pretty sick film . Sardu ( Seamus O'Brien ) and his dwarf sidekick Ralphus ( Luis De Jesus ) are white slave traders masquerading as theater performance artists . During their low-rent performance art / magic show they torture naked women before a live audience . The film is filled with blatant misogyny . Women are used as tables , torn apart on a rack , one is put in a guillotine and forced to hold the robe keeping the blade up her teeth while she is caned , another woman has her ass used as a dartboard etc . The special effects are pretty awful , so their impact equals zero . The acting is bad and the film is very boring . So if you're looking for a laughably bad exploitation film with lots of amateurish gore , then give this one a look . Still there are better and more disturbing horror movies out there . Really , " Blood Sucking Freaks " is nothing in comparison to " Cannibal Holocaust " , " In a Glass Cage " , " Bunman-The Untold Story " or " Last House on Dead End Street " . You have been warned !
407617	865972	67361	8.0	Trippy Italian giallo .	A troubled rich woman Carol Hammond played by Florinda Bolkan is suffering from a series of bizarre sexual dreams where she indulges in lesbian activities with her neighbor Julia Durer ( Anita Strindberg ) . Unfortunately one morning after another perverse sex dream culminating in a gory knifing of Julia , Carol is shocked to find that Julia was murdered in her apartment the stormy night before . When all evidence points to Carol being the culprit she must not only investigate the crime but determine what is dream and what is reality . " Lizard in a Woman's Skin " is perhaps the most bizarre and puzzling Fulci's giallo . The cinematography by Luigi Kuvellier is splendid with some gorgeous visuals and the dream scenes are appropriately psychedelic . The eviscerated dogs sequence still shocks unprepared viewers drawn into the murder mystery aspect of the film . .
407622	865972	371839	8.0	Absolutely vile and sickening film .	Daisuke Yamanouchi's " Mu Zan E " is about a young journalist , who is searching for snuff movies . The film shows us a snuff / porn making underground industry ala " Last House on Dead End Street " or " Tesis " . It's extremely grim and gory and it pulls no punches with its sheer nastiness . There are some incredibly revolting scenes of gore and sexual violence , so fans of Japanese pinku eiga sickies won't be disappointed . It seems to me that Japanese culture is loaded with sadism and bloodletting and this carries over into the realms of cinema and literature . Anyway , if you're a fan of the " Guinea Pig " series or " Cannibal Holocaust " you can't miss this one . However if you're squeamish don't watch it !
407143	865972	85609	9.0	Truly bizarre horror film from Hong Kong .	" Red Spell Spells Red " is one of the rarest HK horror films in my collection . I managed to get this extremely obscure piece of gory horror on VCD whilst being in Kuala Lumpur . In a big cave an evil dwarf sorcerer is performing a bizarre ritual . Suddenly four righteous sorcerers enter the cave and attack him . In the subsequent struggle they wound the dwarf sorcerer fatally and throw him into a stone coffin . They carefully seal the coffin . The present time : a group of photographers investigate the legend of the evil sorcerer . They enter the cave and break the seal . Red smoke gushes from the coffin and ghastly things start to happen . A young man is killed by an unseen force , another is killed by the woods that came alive . When dozens of scorpions attack the people in the village , it seems clear that village is cursed . An old sorcerer tries to remove the powerful spell . " Red Spell Spells Red " is a dark and suspenseful horror film that left me stunned . The tone of the film is serious , albeit there is a little bit of humor to be found here . The scenes of scorpions attacking people are creepy and horrifying . The film has some grisly scenes of animal cruelty thrown in for a good measure . Some pigs are killed with a knife and in truly disgusting moment a possessed man kills a hen by eating it alive in front of the camera . The gore effects are surprisingly effective for example a hand is cut off after the sting of the scorpion or a woman is attacked by a fishing net and wooden beams . The film is almost impossible to find , so don't hesitate to get a copy . .
407106	865972	814685	9.0	Brutal and savage French horror .	" Frontieres " by Xavier Gens plays like the berserk and utterly deranged French version of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " Hostel " with the family of bloodthirsty Neo-Nazis instead of stereotypical redneck crazies . The violence with the exception of the great and gory band saw scene is rather suggestive and wasn't explicit with the camera panning away or jump cutting almost all the gory bits . Still " Frontieres " is a very intense and visceral experience that will surely please the most hardcore horror fans . The killings are pretty brutal in their extremity , the acting is fine and some scenes are incredibly intense . I enjoyed the music in this flick , which was excellently blended into the action . The plot goes like that : running from Paris the group of youths end up taking refuge at a run-down motel on the Luxembourg border presided over by the Von Geisler family and is thrown into bloody nightmare . The two older " sisters " entice the guys with a vigorous foursome while the marginally less depraved youngest girl-plucked from her real family years earlier to be a breeding vessel for this one-assists our heroine when she is eyed up as representing new blood to continue the family line . .
408025	865972	368774	9.0	Very bleak , disturbing and depressing film .	Jeremiah is a seven-year-old boy torn away from his loving foster family to be forcibly reunited with his selfishly drug-addled mother Sarah played by Asia Argento . Jeremiah is fed cold Spaghetti-Os and given baby toys and has to endure an endless heaping of verbal , physical , emotional and sexual assaults from not just his mother , but also her numerous male companions . " The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things " is a depressing adaptation of a book written by mysterious writer JT LeRoy . This is an ugly and brutal film that sometimes plays like the bone-chilling documentary . The cinematography is stylish , the direction by Asia Argento is excellent and there are some truly disturbing and heartbreaking scenes of child abuse . Overall , this is a sickening , utterly relentless portrait of abuse and mental illness that I strongly recommend for anyone brave enough to watch .
407707	865972	68367	9.0	Excellent and totally captivating giallo !	This superbly stylish giallo and gripping precursor to " Don't Look Now " ( 1973 ) about a child murderer is one of the finest Italian thrillers I have ever seen . George Lazenby shines in a lead role , while wonderful Anita Strindberg more than makes up for it with charm and gusto . It's also very nice to see Nicoletta Elmi ( " Demons " , " Deep Red " ) in a small role . The killings are well-handled and fairly gory and the score by Ennio Morricone is simply masterful ! Highly recommended .
407017	865972	269266	9.0	Pretty spooky South Korean slasher .	" Gawi " / " Nightmare " is obviously inspired by " Prom Night " and Japanese hit " Ringu " , but director Byeong Ki-Ahn managed to generate a wonderfully creepy atmosphere throughout it . The film is extremely well-made and photographed . Ha Ji-weon gives a genuinely unnerving performance as a Kyung-Ah . The scene , where she walks through the busload of corpses with bloodied face , is truly eerie and memorable . The film is pretty standard , but it managed to scare me , so I'd recommend it to anyone interested in horror . There is also a fair amount of blood and gore , so gore-hounds won't be disappointed too . My rating : .
406887	865972	221928	9.0	Creepy ! Spoilers	After watching such overrated horror movies like " The Blair Witch Project " , " Scream " or " The Sixth Sense " finally here is the film which really delivers the goods . Of course it's quite similar to " The Shining " ( 1980 ) , but honestly I don't care . The atmosphere is really creepy , the acting is excellent and the ending literally blew me away ( I love that Fulciesque zombies in the basement ) ! There is no gore-just a well-constructed mystery that is best viewed late at night . Check out this truly eerie film !
407218	865972	804552	9.0	Very dark and ugly thriller .	When the corpses of a gangster and his pregnant crack whore girlfriend surface-he brutally mutilated , she electrocuted-it remains a mystery why ' WAZ ' was carved into the girl's belly after her death and when a second pair of bodies is found , one of them marked with the same cryptic letters , the hunt for a serial killer begins . The cynic cop played by Stellan Skarsgard tries to find the tormented serial killer . . . " W Delta Z " aka " WAZ " is so bleak , hopeless and utterly dark that it's almost suffocating . Its theme of moral emptiness and the scenes of graphic torture will no doubt upset some unprepared viewers . The film is shot almost entirely at night by Morten Søborg of " Pusher " fame . The script by Clive Bradley is intelligent with its central theme of non-existence of altruism and is completely devoid of any light . I simply can't wait for Tom Shankland's bleak survival horror " The Day " ( 2008 ) . Finally I live for such gritty and ugly cinema like " WAZ " .
407204	865972	50894	9.0	Another horror classic from Hammer .	Frankenstein escapes the guillotine and flees to Carlsbruck where he passes himself off as Dr Victor Stein and makes a living as a general practitioner . Three years later , while working in the town's hospital for the poor where he carries on his experiments , he is recognized by a visiting physician , Dr Hans Kleve and the two decide to work together on creating a new artificial man . Using donors from the hospital , Frankenstein has built a new body into which he agrees to transplant the brain of his hunchbacked assistant Karl . Once completed and given life , the new creature is left in the care of the poor hospital where a well-meaning nurse releases it . As the new Karl tries to destroy his old body , a sadistic janitor savagely beats the creature and his brain is badly damaged , triggering cannibalistic urges . . . " The Revenge of Frankenstein " is one of the best horror films from Hammer . It has many of the components of traditional Hammer horror ( secret labs full of bubbling beakers , foggy streets and of course another great performance by Peter Cushing ) , but it also has a surprisingly gentle monster whose story is as much sad as it is horrifying . Recommended . .
407700	865972	74670	9.0	Exploitation in its finest form !	Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne ) and her two lesbian guards-Satin and Velvet run a harem for depraved sheik ( Victor Alexander ) Of course women are tortured and abused in front of the audience ! This film is much more campier than " Ilsa-She Wolf of the SS " and not nearly as shocking . Still there are some torture scenes and a good amount of sleaze and nudity to satisfy exploitation freaks ! Check it out !
407698	865972	81184	9.0	Hilariously funny , grisly and bizarre horror comedy .	" Motel Hell " has loads of style and rural atmosphere , plenty of laughs plus a little bit of gore . The film was somewhat influenced by " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " ( 1974 ) and " Eaten Alive " ( 1976 ) , but there are some original ideas floating here like planting ( ? ) people in the garden . Rory Calhouln is amazing as a Farmer Vincent , and the finale when he wears the pigface is a hoot ! Highly recommended .
407683	865972	61994	9.0	Truly bizarre Italian giallo .	" Death Laid an Egg " by Giulio Questi is a wonderful giallo full of surrealism . Mark only married his wife Anna because of her chicken fortune . They run a chicken farm between the two of them . Mark has been having several affairs including one with Gabriella . Things start to complicate when Gabriella moves in with Mark and Anna . Gabriella and Mark continue their affair and plot Anna's death . " Death Laid an Egg " is a psychedelic giallo that has to be seen to be believed . The acting by Gina Lollobrigida and Jean-Louis Trintignant is excellent and the score by Bruno Maderna fits the mood perfectly . So if you like weird Italian cinema give this one a look . My other recommendations : " Autopsy " by Armando Crispino and " A Quiet Place in the Country " by Elio Petri .
408082	865972	67341	9.0	Very creepy horror gem .	Jessica ( Zohra Lampert ) , her husband and their friend start a new life in the country , but Jessica , who has a history off mental illness , starts to believe the area is haunted and grows suspicious of the young woman who has joined them at their house . . . " Let's Scare Jessica to Death " is an excellent low-budget horror film loaded with eerie atmosphere of rising paranoia . Zohra Lampert does a terrific job showing us Jessica's growing desperation and there are some fairly gruesome gore effects at the end . The photography is gritty and the climax is extremely haunting . The viewer is never sure whether Jessica is really onto something sinister , or whether she's just going insane . There are some subtle touches of eeriness : Jessica's husband drives a hearse , and she decorates their new home with tracings she made from a local cemetery . So if you are a fan of old-fashioned spooky horror films give this overlooked gem a look . .
407809	865972	462499	10.0	A massive bloodshed .	John Rambo is leading a near-isolation life as the cobra hunter near the Salween River near the Thailand-Burma Border . In the neighborhood Burma there is a civil war where the Burmese Military is fighting with the Karen people who comprise of poor laborers and farmers and the fight has been going on for over 60 years with lots of bloodshed and genocide . A group of human right activists headed by Dr Michael Burnett along with volunteer Sarah approach Rambo to give them a safe passage to Burma so that they can give medical assistance . When he does take them to a neighboring village , the militia brutally attack the villagers and take the activists hostage . A rescue mission is sent to get the hostages alive . But they need the support of only one man-John Rambo . One hell of a violent flick ! The action is fast-paced , the violence is brutal and bloody and Sly Stallone looks more stronger than in his previous Rambo movies . .
407621	865972	338095	10.0	Truly grisly and relentless shocker .	Two friends Marie and Alex drive into the remote countryside to visit Alex's mother , father and little brother . Soon a vicious madman ( Philippe Nahon ) attacks the isolated farmhouse , violently murdering the entire family except for the girls . " Haute Tension " is an unsettling and grisly shocker with plenty of gore and violence . The killings are extremely bloody and graphic and the atmosphere of intensity and desperation is well-captured . The gore effects made by Gianetto De Rossi are disturbingly realistic - there is for example a very gory decapitation , a nasty throat slashing , an axe in the chest . So if you're a fan of gritty horror films like " Maniac " or " The New York Ripper " you can't miss it . Highly recommended . .
406821	865972	70565	10.0	Absolutely awesome Italian occult horror film .	" The Perfume of the Lady in Black " by Francesco Barilli is an extremely stylish and beautifully shot occult horror film that is often regarded as one of the most underrated Italian horror movies ever made . This film influenced the works of Dario Argento-there are themes and set-pieces that would re-appear , virtually unchanged , in Argento's " Deep Red " , " Suspiria " and " Inferno " . The cinematography is simply astounding and the score by Nicola Piovani is genuinely creepy . Mimsy Farmer plays an industrial scientist named Silvia who is troubled by strange hallucinations . These images that seem so real point to a tragic event from her childhood : the suicide of her mother . " The Perfume of the Lady in Black " is obviously inspired by both " Don't Look Now " and " Rosemary's Baby " , but there are some lashings of grisly violence ( the evisceration / cannibalism scene is particularly nasty and gruesome ) . Overall , this Italian baffling psycho-shocker is a suitably unsettling exercise in psychological horror with incredibly beautiful Mimsy Farmer . A must-see for anyone interested in Italian horror . .
406886	865972	112643	10.0	Depressing , disgusting , excellent !	" Castle Freak " is brilliant ! It's gory and downbeat film from Stuart Gordon ( " Re-Animator " , " From Beyond " ) - I love it ! Anyway this one has a cult fave Jeffrey Combs and a rather frumpy Barbara Crampton moving into a castle where a freak has been chained in a dungeon for many years . It kills a hooker brought home by Combs , then goes after the family . Great special effects , good direction and solid acting . Gordon manages to create some pretty tense moments ( especially this gruesome sex / death scene ! ) , and there are enough good scares and shocks to make you jump a few times . The scene , when freak bites off hooker's nipple is pretty repulsive and disturbing . A must-see for genre fans !
407438	865972	167147	10.0	Wonderful Japanese horror film .	Toshiharu Ikeda's " Evil Dead Trap " was really popular in Japan , spawning at least two sequels . Nami ( Miyuki Ono ) , a late night TV show host , receives a strange tape . It shows the brutal murder of a young Japanese woman . Nami launches her own investigation , taking four of her crew to an abandoned Army base . However somebody , or possibly something is waiting for them . . . " Evil Dead Trap " is obviously influenced by the works of Dario Argento , Lucio Fulci , Sam Raimi and David Cronenberg . It has even Goblinesque soundtrack which reminds me Argento's " Suspiria " . Still the film has some wonderful surprises-it's atmospheric and very gory . The death scenes are pretty graphic and gruesome , so gorehounds won't be disappointed . I really liked the use of booby traps to kill some of the victims . The ending is also very surprising . All in all I enjoyed this film and you should too , if you're a fan of Japanese extreme horror !
407177	865972	211971	10.0	Nasty and disturbing thriller .	" Born for Hell " / " Naked Massacre " takes place in Belfast , Northern Ireland during civil war and IRA terror . A group of eight young innocent nurses are sharing a house with no men to protect them . Mathieu Carriere is an ex-Vietnam soldier , with a pathological hate for all women . In a night of bloody horror he stalks the nurses , murdering them one by one until all meet their demise at the hands of this madman . The film is truly unsettling with some nasty scenes of misogynistic sexual violence . It is apparently based on actual events ( Richard Speck - mass murderer of eight innocent nurses in 1966 ) , what makes it even more disturbing and grim . The acting is very good and it's nice to see Leonora Fani ( " Giallo a Venezia " - 1979 ) as Jenny . The film is extremely hard to find , so grab the copy and treasure it . Still it's a pretty strong stuff and definitely not for everybody .
407560	865972	422401	10.0	Amazing slasher flick with lots of humor and grisly gore .	The plot of " Hatchet " centers on friends Ben and Marcus , who decide to join a haunted bayou cruise . Led by maverick guide Shawn the doomed group of tourists sails into the darkness . The boat sinks in waters known to be haunted by Victor " Hatchet Face " Crowley ( Kane Hodder ) , who aims at butchering his guests piece by piece . " Hatchet " is amazing . It perfectly blends humor with stomach churning gore . The violence is so gruesome that it quickly becomes comical , Victor Crowley looks wonderfully campy and the gore flows freely . The best part of Green's film is its comic pacing . Due to its frenetic action the film often reminded me Sam Raimi's splatter classic " The Evil Dead " . So if you are a fan of crazy early 80's slasher gorefests give it a look .
407053	865972	180093	10.0	Raw and compelling .	I finally caught " Requiem for a Dream " in a small independent cinema and what can I say ? - this film is absolutely brilliant , because it really grabbed me and left me speechless at the end . It's probably the best drug drama ever made and it is totally different from every other drama you'll ever see-it's an unique picture in many ways and boosts astonishingly brilliant and believable performances ( especially Ellen Burstyn is amazing as a pills-addicted Sara Goldfarb ) , breathtaking visuals and a masterpiece of a film score . " Requiem for a Dream " is definitely disturbing , but it makes you think which is more important than pure entertainment . Sometimes I don't want just to see the film-I want to feel it ! ! ! This masterpiece is a pure rollercoaster of emotions-it's sad ( some scenes made my cry a little bit ! ) , horrifying , depressing , sometimes even repulsive and yet hauntingly beautiful . The music made by Clint Mansell is also awesome ! - a must see !
407780	865972	66516	10.0	Unique and totally brilliant .	" Valerie and Her Week of Wonders " is a wonderfully surreal and hallucinatory horror / fantasy tale made by Jaromil Jires . This poetic film looks like a curious mixture of " Alice in Wonderland " and " Nosferatu " . The pubescent Valerie is awakened one day by a pasty-faced , Nosferatu-like vampire who steals her earrings ( which , we later learn , are imbued with magical powers ) . She pursues him , but he manages to vanish into a crowd . She spots the vampire again later , feebly disguised behind a mouse-head mask , and points him out to her ( alarmingly pale ) grandmother . As it turns out , the earring thief has vampirized Valerie's grannie , along with much of the town , and furthermore has set up shop in the dark , cobwebby basement of Valerie's house ! Matters aren't helped by the presence of a lecherous priest with an eye for Valerie , but things really come to a head when Val's young , pretty ' aunt ' moves in and tries to take Valerie out of the picture . The aunt is in fact Val's vampirized grandmother looking to further the head vamp's nefarious aims . Luckily Valerie's one true love , a dashing young man , is there to help her escape her grandmother's clutches and defeat the vampires , which inspires a mass celebration among the townspeople , ending with them all surrounding Valerie as she climbs into an outdoor bed and goes to sleep . The film itself is loaded with incredibly dreamy atmosphere as it mixes perfectly fantasy with reality . The main actress Jaroslava Schallerova is stunningly beautiful . A must-see for fans of poetic horror . .
407996	865972	100625	10.0	Truly brilliant sequel .	" Chinese Ghost Story 2 " is almost as amazing as the first " Chinese Ghost Story " ( 1987 ) . Again the film is incredibly energetic , atmospheric and filled with incredibly well-choreographed fight scenes . Of course the special effects may be a little bit cheesy at times ( especially the monster is funny looking ! ) , but the film is extremely entertaining for horror , fantasy and even comedy fans . So don't wait any longer-check it out now . Highly recommended . .
406753	865972	74455	10.0	Tobe Hooper's masterpiece of rural horror !	" Eaten Alive " ( 1976 ) , director Tobe Hooper's second and less successful stab at backwoods horror following the success / notoriety of his brilliant " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " ( 1974 ) is one of the most bizarre horror movies ever made . The plot revolves around demented motel owner Judd ( Neville Brand ) who likes feeding his guests to his pet alligator in the swamp outside . With its gory set-pieces and gratuitous nudity , and Neville Brand's over-the-top performance as Judd " Eaten Alive " is a truly visceral experience . Great location sets : the dilapidated hotel at the edge of the swamp is so bizarre , that it may as well exist on another planet , or in some alternate insane reality . The acting is very good , Marilyn Burns once again proves that she can emote hysterically and Robert Englund is really convincing as a local-yokel Buck . The film is grainy , even ugly looking at times , so don't expect any polished crap from Hollywood . For me this the best ( along with his debut of course ! ) Tobe Hooper's horror film . A must see for horror fans !
407797	865972	76786	10.0	An absolute masterpiece of pure horror . Spoilers	" Suspiria " is the most beautiful , dreamlike horror film ever made . Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Banyon , a young ballet dancer studying at prestigious Tanzakademie in Freiburg , Germany . On the night of her arrival , a fellow student is chased by a demonic killer who stabs her repeatedly in the chest , finally piercing his knife into her exposed , still-beating heart . He then ties his victim with rope and she falls through a glass ceiling , hanging from her neck as a large shard of glass bisects another student standing below . The next morning Suzy meets the school's head Madam Blanc ( Joan Bennett ) and one of the teachers Miss Tanner ( Alida Valli ) . Upon making friends with a girl named Sara ( Stefania Casini ) , Suzy learns that all is not quite as it seems and the final truth is horrifying-the academy is a front of a coven of witches , headed by mysterious Mater Suspiriorum . The photography by Luciano Tovoli is brilliant , the musical score by synth rock group Goblin is simply outstanding . Dario Argento creates an atmosphere of horrific dread . Plenty of suspense plus some of the most shocking scenes of violence you'll ever see . Truly a masterpiece " Suspiria " is necessary viewing for anyone interested in horror movies . An absolute 10 .
407276	865972	237045	10.0	Very nasty and sexually violent pinku eiga shocker .	During the mid-1970s and early 80's , Nikkatsu-the most important of the pinku eiga studios-launched a series of pink films which were progressively more extreme in their level of sexual violence . " Assault ! Jack the Ripper " is certainly one of the nastiest pink films I have ever came across . It tells the story of a young waitress and a cook , who after incidentally killing a young woman on a street ends up sadistically raping and murdering women via stabbing them in the crotch . The scenes of rape and sexual violence are truly unsettling , but the film is well-made and acted . Yasuharu Hasebe directed a series of very extreme Nikkatsu pink movies including brutal " Rape ! " and horrendously offensive " Rape ! 13th Hour " . In 1979 came Koyu Ohara's " Zoom Up : Rape Site " , notorious for a scene in which a rapist shoves a light bulb inside a woman's vagina , then stomps on her stomach until it breaks . " Assault ! Jack the Ripper " is not easy to find , but for fans of misogynistic Japanese exploitation this sleazy sickie is a must-see . .
407775	865972	76630	10.0	Creepy as hell and unsettling backwoods slasher / survival film .	Five doctors go on a vacation in the Canadian forest and are hunted and killed one by one by a crazed serial killer . A man's leg is graphically caught in a bear trap ; one is beheaded and another is hung from a tree and set on fire . This almost completely unknown Canadian slasher is one of the best low-budget horror films ever made . Often compared to " Deliverance " , it certainly has a similar theme . The film brilliantly conveys an atmosphere of total dread and fear , the feeling of losing control of the world around you . The climax is extremely eerie and haunting . There are some truly unsettling moments like the scene where one of the doctors is strung up , pleading for help whilst getting burned alive . " Rituals " features some striking shots such as the killer's lone silhouette watching from the horizon which elicit an ominous and almost unbearable sense of dread . This obscure horror flick is even better than " Just Before Dawn " , so if you are a fan of slasher flicks you can't miss it . Just beware : there are two main versions available , the easily obtainable but edited TV version and the extremely rare complete version that has nearly ten minutes of extra footage . Be sure to get an uncut print !
407831	865972	90197	10.0	Supremely dark and disturbing horror film .	" In a Glass Cage " has to be one of the most disturbing horror films ever made . The film is extremely intense and so incredibly depressing and powerful in its honest depiction of mankind's failure and instincts towards violence and sadism . The soundtrack is outstanding and the music alone will make the viewer speechless , not to speak the sound of an iron lung that has to be among the most disgusting sounds I've ever heard . The acting is excellent , but there are several truly disturbing scenes of pedophilia and child murder . " In a Glass Cage " is a very difficult movie to watch , however you'll also walk away mesmerized by the disgusting beauty of this film itself . Nazi doctor Meisner abused and killed many young boys during war . After a suicide attempt he is now paralyzed and confined to an iron lung . One day , his former victim Angelo comes to work for him as a nurse . However , the revenge he has planned for the cripple is dominated by traumatic perversion . Give this overlooked masterpiece a look . .
407164	865972	49366	10.0	Tense and exciting horror / science fiction classic .	" Invasion of the Body Snatchers " directed by Don Siegel is a classic horror / science fiction experience . The acting is great , the action is fast paced and the film , unlike many other horror films from early 50's and 60's , is never boring . Hell , even the special effects are amazing , considering the year the film was made . Easy to follow and lots of fun ! - " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " is a tour de force of good cinema .
407023	865972	71222	10.0	A genuinely creepy horror classic .	Bob Clark's " Black Christmas " is a horror classic . It's obvious that it was clearly an influence on the slasher films of the late seventies and early eighties . " Black Christmas " takes place in a sorority house . Most of the sorority sisters go home for the holidays , while Barb ( Margot Kidder ) , Jess ( Oivia Hussey ) and Phyl ( Andrea Martin ) stay behind . At the outset of the film , we see a mysterious killer enter the house and hide in the attic . He then begins to kill the sisters one by one , with each murder being followed by a disturbing phone call . Bob Clark managed to create a startling atmosphere of total dread and fear . The finale is extremely creepy and memorable . The soundtrack , particularly the killer's voice on the phone is frighteningly effective . So if you want to be scared give this gem a look . Highly recommended .
