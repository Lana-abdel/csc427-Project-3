407157	865972	85471	1.0	Incredibly boring garbage .	Art student Richard Alfieri keeps dreaming that his twin brother ? who died before birth ? is determined to kill him and take over his body . Insanely melodramatic and extremely boring drama with no horror whatsoever . The suspense is completely absent as is the gore . After finishing one hour of this turd I was so utterly bored that I decided to rewind the rest of " Living Nightmare " . I can't believe that this pile of garbage was actually released on DVD and so many real horror films are still obscure and unavailable for mass consumption . I rarely give low budget horror movies the lowest rating possible , however this one truly deserves a big fat .
407794	865972	89274	1.0	Another proof that Wes Craven is overrated .	Wes Craven-many horror fans consider him as a master of horror , but after watching his truly god-awful movies like " Deadly Friend " , " Invitation to Hell " and this one I came to conclusion that he is very overrated . Only three of his movies are actually worth watching : " Last House on the Left " which is brilliant , " The Hills Have Eyes " and " Deadly Blessing " which are pretty good . His other movies , including overrated " Scream " and " A Nightmare on Elm Street " are a typical Hollywood garbage . " The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 " is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters , who are attacked by cannibals : Pluto ( Michael Berryman ) and his uncle Reaper ( John Bloom ) . Absolutely no suspense , even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks ( although there's a nice throat slashing ) . The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid . The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb , but also hilarious at the same time . Avoid this junk like the plague . Not recommended .
408044	865972	94591	1.0	Piece of garbage .	A dark and terrible secret lurks on the 13th floor of a plush city office block , where a supernatural curse has brought disaster to anyone who rents it . A mysterious ' presence ' has driven business to ruin , made office machinery break down and created a deadly lifeforce of its own in the electrical system . The tortured soul of an innocent boy who was cruelly murdered many years before is lying in wait for the moment of revenge . " The 13th Floor " is easily one of the worst horror films I have ever seen . The film is extremely boring and there is no gore nor suspense . The special effects are incredibly cheesy and the acting is horrible . Why such piece of crap is widely distributed and some Italian horror movies are completely unavailable is beyond me . .
407971	865972	102965	2.0	Piece of crap .	" The Ungodly " is one of the worst horror movies I have seen ( and I've seen nearly 2000 horror movies so far ) . This is a slobbering , dire , stupid mess of a film directed by Raphael Nussbaum . I can't believe I wasted my money on such a diabolically bad , excrement laden piece of trash . The acting is awful , the special effects are cheesy beyond belief and there's plenty of silly humour in this one . I found here also the most idiotic depiction of Satanism ever captured on screen . There's no suspense , no gore , just huge pile of idiocy . Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs . ( because the final appearance of Satan is hysterically funny and there's also a little bit of sex ) .
408090	865972	118604	2.0	A real yawner !	" An American Werewolf in Paris " is one of the worst werewolf movies ever made . The intro is actually pretty good , but after it the film goes quickly downhill . The direction is horrible and the characters are even worse . No suspense , no scares , just huge load of rubbish . Generally the special effects are okay , but creators of this garbage put an overdose of them into the plot . I don't know why so many people like this sorry piece of crap . Personally I like horror movies to be scary and disturbing . This one isn't even gory , so don't bother with it . Oh , and these terrible CGI werewolves are some of the fakest I have ever seen . Avoid " An American Werewolf in Paris " like the plague . Not recommended .
408166	865972	357507	2.0	Epitomizes everything what's awful with mainstream American horror .	A young man named Tim is traumatized by memories of terrible events he experienced in his childhood bedroom . Years later he reluctantly returns home to face his fears of a monstrous entity called Boogeyman that could be real or merely a figment of his imagination . Did a Boogeyman really steal his father away from the house all those years ago ? Are his nearest and dearest in danger as the monster returns from the past to haunt the present ? Does anybody want to suffer whilst watching this piece of garbage ? " Boogeyman " is just another lame and politically correct horror film that's not even remotely scary . The film has all the typical horror movie cinematic clich√©s for example lightning and thunder , silhouetted figures outside in the rain and dead people that talk on screen . The jump scares are irritating and the use of CGI effects is awful . The characters are completely uninteresting and there is absolutely no suspense . Avoid this bloodless piece of junk like the plague . This is surely one of the worst horror films of 2005 .
406832	865972	71198	2.0	Terrible horror film .	After being bitten by a bat in a cave , a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat creature . His wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him , it's all just due to rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he's taking . The local cop thinks that John is responsible for several gruesome murders . " The Bat People " by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible film . The script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity . This pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it . Even the design of a man-bat creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable . Avoid this stinker like the plague . .
407271	865972	259233	3.0	Amazingly horrible low-budget slasher flick , but I have seen worse .	Four unlucky photography students head into the Nevada desert to take photos for an extra credit assignment , but they find themselves stalked by a vicious machete-wielding killer Quiltface who wears a mask made from human skin . Massimiliano Cerchi's " Carnage Road " is an incredibly poor slasher film filled with atrocious acting and stupid characters . The pacing is awful , the death scenes via machete are weak and the gore effects are amateurish . " Carnage Road " plays like the homage to " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " The Hills Have Eyes " , but offers nothing fresh or interesting . Thankfully Mack Hail of " Nutbag " fame is amazingly funny as the driver who picks up four students and so is the final confrontation between Quiltface and the last survivor . Watch this only under the influence of alcohol . .
407162	865972	91223	4.0	Watchable piece of junk !	" House " isn't completely bad , but isn't great either . Usually I don't like horror comedies ( apart from Peter Jackson's stuff ) and this film isn't also exception . The gore is virtually gone as is any trace of originality . William Katt is basically decent as a writer , who fights with demons in the house and the film is quite entertaining and relatively non-violent-good for children ! OK , if you want a bad copy of " The Evil Dead " and " Demons " mixed with humour , you can try this one , just don't expect something really exciting . Not really recommended . Avoid its sequels like the plague .
407525	865972	357585	4.0	Truly mediocre and forgettable horror / comedy .	Set in a New Brunswick college town , our heroes are a pair of easy going roommates named Luke and Roger . After sneaking into a sorority girl's room to return some quarters , Luke spies the girl sprouting tentacles in front of her friend-who's casually huffing liquid nitrogen . Luke reasonably comes to the conclusion that the two are aliens-though none of his friends believe him ( he was drunk at the time ) . After a pair of suspicious deaths , Luke becomes convinced he's right and begins investigating . " Decoys " is loaded with fake scares and plenty of bad CGI imagery . The almost complete lack of gore and violence is also hard to forgive . There are some mildly humorous moments , but the pace is rather slow and the acting is weak . So if you want a proper and intelligent Canadian horror watch again " Ginger Snaps " or check out late 70's slasher classic " Rituals " .
407629	865972	71754	4.0	Pretty bad soft-core sex comedy .	There is nothing even remotely interesting or particularly arousing in this boring piece of soft-core sex trash . The only reason to watch it is lovely Sylvia Kristel from " Emmanuelle " and " Private Lessons " . The sex scenes are strictly soft-core and rather uninteresting . The last sex scene on tennis court in the rain is pretty good , though . The acting is mediocre and the film is loaded with some truly annoying and laughable characters . Sylvia Kristel provides some nudity , but there is not enough T & A for my liking . " Julia " is a pretty obscure film , so if you're a fan of cheerful exploitation you may give it a look . Just don't expect something really arousing , because this film is just average . Watch Joe D'Amato's sleazy sexploitation movies or Walerian Borowczyk's erotic stuff instead . My rating : .
408107	865972	325597	5.0	Sick little film .	Eric Stanze's " I Spit On Your Corpse , I Piss On Your Grave " is a piece of vile exploitation , which reminds me nasty movies from the 70's such as the rape and revenge genre . However unlike excellent " Scrapbook " this film was made only to shock the viewer . It is still one of the most extreme movies I have ever seen . Some scenes of sexual torture and humiliation are pretty hard to stomach . The most disturbing moment for me is when Sandy ( Emily Haack ) forces one guy to eat his own excrement . The scene , where Sandy masturbates with a broomstick and then shoves it into another guy's ass is pretty vile and unsettling too . The actress , Emily Haack is wonderful-her performance is simply outstanding . The film may be not as good as " Scrapbook " , but anyone who likes violent exploitation should be pleased . .
407291	865972	83723	5.0	Standard German soft-core sex film .	Hubert Frank's " Catherine Cherie " is nothing special . It works as a soft-core porn , but the dialogue is horrible and the music is extremely irritating . The sex scenes are strictly soft-core , but there is one hard-core sex scene with Ajita Wilson giving a blow job . The main actress Berta Cabre is pretty hot and has a nice body . Give this one a look , if you're into sleazy European exploitation . . I still think that " Vanessa " ( 1977 ) is much better .
407004	865972	845442	5.0	Too melodramatic and dull .	Mommy's little girl Hyeon Su is a normal 17-year old student , beautiful enough to disregard her friends latest obsession : plastic surgery . Or maybe the lack of interest is due to the fact her gentle mother Yong Hee is a plastic surgeon . When one of her friends decides to go under the knife for a little skin revision , Yong Hee gives her more than a pretty new face . The result is blood all over the place . Seeing so many of her friends die , Hyeon Su finds comfort in her friend Seung Eun , but then she discovers a creepy secret of her mother . . . Some reviewers compared this film to masterful " A Tale of Two Sisters " , but it's clearly not as good and memorable . In fact it's pretty dull and offers almost zero scares . " Cinderella " looks slick , the acting is fine and Korean girls are jaw-droppingly beautiful , unfortunately the action moves at the snail's pace . Skip this one . .
407649	865972	1010271	5.0	Murder is clean in " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " .	" The Poughkeepsie Tapes " - a faux documentary about the activities of the mixed serial killer from Poughkeepsie called The Waterstreet Butcher garnered tons of hype before its official release . The premise of the film is certainly interesting : the police raids a home of suspect and finds it empty aside from boxes of VHS tapes . On these video cassettes are hundreds of hours of footage recorded by a serial killer as he filmed the abductions , torture , murder and disposal of his victims . " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " plays like a tame version of " August Underground " series . The amount of violence and terror is surprisingly minimal . What drags " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " down is truly horrible acting . The interviews with investigators ( there is even laughable " dismemberment expert " ) are terrible as was the archive footage of court proceedings and press conferences . The killer is also ridiculous as he giggles and yells and acts more like a total buffoon . " The Poughkeepsie Tapes " is not shocking or disturbing . The torture and murder scenes are usually off-screen and they lack a bite . If you want to see truly horrifying serial killer movie check out Austrian " Angst " from 1983 . .
407988	865972	1221927	5.0	Forgettable and suspenseless Polish horror .	Four friends come to old and abandoned factory in Nether Silesia where a year ago a friend died . So they try find out how and why he died but in the end they found an horrific truth about experiments conducted in the factory . A group of research workers kidnap them and use them as human guinea-pigs in an effort to attain immortality . . . Well , being Polish I wanted to see this film pretty badly , because Poland don't have any visible tradition when it comes to horror genre . Unfortunately " Pora Mroku " disappoints on almost every level . The characters are obnoxious and stupid , the suspense is completely absent , the gore is kept to minimum and the plot borrows few elements from " Hostel " . On a plus side I enjoyed dirty and claustrophobic location sets and menacing electro soundtrack . .
407254	865972	772197	5.0	Horror in the music studio - unfortunately unsatisfying .	A rock band prepare to record their comeback album by locking themselves in a recording studio overnight . They sample an old recording which turns out to hide a mysterious voice that opens a gateway to Hell . " Reverb " was currently released in Poland on DVD , so naturally I wanted to give it a look . Unfortunately the film left me disappointed . The premise of " Reverb " is actually pretty interesting , but its execution is unsatisfying and rather dull . There is no suspense , just a lot of quick cuts , even the amount of grue is minimal . Overall , I didn't enjoy this film as much as I wanted . Still if you have enough time to kill give it a chance . .
406980	865972	373883	5.0	Not as bad as it's reputed to be , but Carpenter's original is still better .	The first half of Rob Zombie's " Halloween " covers Michael Myers youth , where he was a long-haired blonde kid who liked to torture and kill animals . On the Halloween night Michael kills his scumbag stepfather , his sister and her boyfriend , then he is placed in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where he spends a long time visited by the his psychiatrist Dr . Loomis . After 15 years Loomis moves on Myers escapes and the slaughter in Haddonfield begins . . . Every horror fan knows exactly the plot of John Carpenter's horror classic " Halloween " , so I won't be wasting my time describing it in detail . Rob Zombie's remake differs from it in some aspects : the atmosphere is dirty and grimy , the characters are sleazy and the killings with a butcher knife are quite gory . Zombie also likes his nods to the horror genre : black and white movies like " The Thing From Another World " and " White Zombie " pop up on television sets , finally Blue √ñyster Cult's " Don't Fear The Reaper " and The Misfits " Halloween " adorn the soundtrack . Overall , if you want to see somewhat vicious and mean-spirited remake of an instant horror classic check it out . .
407117	865972	115610	5.0	Watchable , but pretty boring .	Some days ago I tracked this one on Polish TV-I wasn't completely disappointed , but it bored me . Just another werewolf film with a lot of CGI-effects . There are some good scenes in this picture , which is well-made and has some pretty cool photography too . Only a little bit of gore , so gore-hounds will certainly be disappointed . Not as bad as " An American Werewolf in Paris " , but nothing really ground-breaking . .
407791	865972	104987	6.0	Okay , but nothing impressive .	" Netherworld " is a typical Full Moon's horror flick-entertaining for a while , but not really memorable . The cast is decent , the photography is pretty good and the story is okay . Basically it's about one guy , who with the help of a sexy witch tries to re-animate his dead father . Not very violent , although there are two or three gore scenes made by Mark Shostrom ( " The Mutilator " ) . The film is also quite atmospheric and relatively well-made . David Schmoeller ( " Tourist Trap " ) is definitely a talented genre director . Anyway , if you like horror movies I would recommend this one . Not the greatest horror flick ever made , but worth checking out .
407618	865972	80100	6.0	Incopetent nonsense with well-known cast .	Kathy Collins is no ordinary eight year old girl . Indeed , she is unique , carrying within her the power of Sateen , an inter-spacial force of immense magnitude . Katy's primary mission on Earth is to carry these genes forward , a task accomplished by convincing her mother Barbara to bear a similarly endowed male child with whom Kathy would eventually mate . " The Visitor " makes no sense . It plays like insane mix of such occult films as " Rosemary's Baby " , " The Exorcist " and " The Omen " but also a tribute to such sci-fi classics as " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " . There are so many disconnected plot elements for example aliens wandering through the desert , giant green clouds billowing up from nowhere or the sky turning the color of blood , but the action is fast paced and some surreal images are quite psychedelic . .
407267	865972	120804	6.0	An enjoyable , but completely unscary zombie romp !	" Resident Evil " isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made , but movie of the year ? ! . . . come on ! I'm sad to have say that this is actually more action flick than horror . As cool as the games are ( at least the first two ) , as mediocre is Anderson's film . Almost no gore at all , pretty bad acting ( the characters in the computer game almost seem lively ) and no uncanny atmosphere to be found . And , by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of " Dawn of the Dead " . Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here . There's one reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning . The sequence where several characters are trapped in the bright , shiny corridor with a deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile . The battle between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent . The climax is okay and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel . The film is well-made and looks really nice , but the lack of gore can't be forgiven . However there are better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example " Zombi 2 " , " Burial Ground " , " The Beyond " , Romero's " Living Dead " trilogy , " Flesheater " , " Meat Market " series etc . The game is also a lot more scarier-if you want a really good , albeit forgotten horror film which is quite similar to the first " Resident Evil " game , please check out " Scarecrows " ( 1988 ) .
407067	865972	95285	6.0	Mildly interesting vampire flick from the director of " Midnight " .	" Heartstopper " was directed by John A . Russo and is based on his own written novel " The Awakening " . The plot is simple : a young doctor named Benjamin Latham condemned and put to death as a warlock in 1776 , is back from the dead in present day Pittsburgh as a fangless vampire who's saliva is a deadly poison and who can walk only during the daylight hours . He meets up with museum curator Moon Zappa , falls in love with her and comes across a copycat serial killer who also seems to have the same vampiric affliction and dispatches women in a style similar to Latham's . The premise of " Heartstopper " is actually pretty unique and original , but the film is surprisingly dull and uninteresting . The cinematography is grainy , the acting is decent and the heavy metal soundtrack adds a raw edge to the urban atmosphere . Give it a look , but " Midnight " is a much better film . .
407761	865972	130487	6.0	Not bad .	Dean Crow's " Backwoods " is nothing special . The film itself is quite entertaining as it reminds me a little bit " Luther the Geek " . Jack O'Hara , who plays William , is truly amazing as a drooling and bearded weirdo . He kills chickens by biting their heads off and goes mad on numerous occasions . The film offers plenty of female nudity and a little bit of gore . The action is rather slow-moving , but the climax is pretty suspenseful and memorable . So if you're a fan of low-budget horror give this one a look-just don't expect something scary or original . My rating : . Here are my other recommendations : " Just Before Dawn " , " Hunter's Blood " , " Blood Tracks " , " Blood Salvage " and " The Hills Have Eyes " .
407819	865972	98331	6.0	A marginally better than " Silent Night , Deadly Night Part 2 "	Dr . Newbury has saved the life of the hideously injured Ricky Caldwell . The doctor has encased his patient's explosive brain inside a Plexiglas cap , yet he has failed to revive him from his deep coma . In Newbury's attempt to reach the comatose victim's mind , he connects Ricky's brain waves to a gifted clairvoyant , Laura Anderson , who unexpectedly taps into the dark and twisted realm of his haunted dreams . Ghastly things begin to happen and detective Connoly ( Robert Culp ) , must fight to stop the dangerous experiment . " Silent Night , Deadly Night 3 " is a mediocre horror film at its best . The pace is horrendously slow , the script is terrible and the acting is weak . Still there are some interesting camera angles and the film is suitably interesting . The next sequel was a completely unrelated gorefest from Brian Yuzna , whose unusual vision ? often rejected by series fans ? was at least a change of pace . .
407142	865972	391198	6.0	Slightly disappointing , but still watchable horror film .	Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen , an exchange student studying social work in Japan who innocently agrees to cover for a nurse who didn't show up for a work . When she enters the assigned home , she discovers an elderly American woman , Emma , who is lost in a catatonic state while the rest of the house appears deserted and disheveled . Suddenly Karen hears scratching sounds from upstairs . Soon she learns the secret of the vengeful curse that has taken root in this house . I was able to see " Ju-On " , before I saw " The Grudge " and I can safely say that this American remake is nowhere nearly as horrifying as the original . Sadly it relies more on shock tactics , such as having ghosts jump out at unexpected moments . However " The Grudge " still has its share of few effective scares and thrills . Overall , if you like Japanese horror movies like " Ju-On " or " Ringu " you can give this one a look . .
406791	865972	900357	6.0	Pretty average teen slasher .	As young children Laura and Henry Porter witness the bloody murder of their parents at the hands of a faceless , hooded psychopath . Years later they remain highly disturbed , but Henry has recovered far more than his sister due to a stint in a mental hospital under the care of a respected psychiatric doctor named Dr Mitchell Allen . When Henry gets the opportunity to work thousands of miles away , his sister Laura decides that she too must finally confront her demons and voluntarily commits herself into the same facility . Soon her fellow patients begin to die . . . " Boogeyman 2 " is the sequel that is almost entirely better than its laughably tame predecessor . There is a decent amount of blood and gore and the acting is not bad with " Saw " star Tobin Bell having a relatively small role . The film relies on slasher clich√©s , there are some huge lapses in logic and the ending is hysterically stupid . Still I rather enjoyed this suitably gory teen slasher . .
407398	865972	106262	6.0	Very average at its best .	The short synopsis of " Amityville : A New Generation " goes like that : a young photographer Terry Keyes receives a mirror as a gift and sees in its reflection a link to murders committed in Amityville decades before . And slowly the artists loft he shares with friends Suki , Dick and Pauli is turned into a living chamber of horrors , as they too fall prey to the dark seductive powers of the mirror . " Amityville : A New Generation " is an average horror flick at its best . There is a little bit of suspense and the characters are surprisingly likable , but the plot is slow-moving and the finale is laughable . I'm not an enthusiast of " Amityville " series , however this seventh installment is actually passable , if you are in the right mood . .
407159	865972	116616	7.0	Sex and violence HK style .	" The Imp " is just another of countless cheap HK exploitation flicks made during 90's . Stunningly sexy Pan Dang plays a Hong Kong woman who's traveling in search of her twin sister , who disappeared leaving nothing more than a native doll , the eponymous imp . Along the way she hooks up with a mobile film crew led by Category III veteran Mark Cheng . They discover that something isn't quite right with the boarding house in which they're staying . " The Imp " offers plenty of raunchy sex and the last 15 minutes or so are pretty violent , but the pace is slow and the script is silly . However Pan Dang steals the show with her impressive breasts . Fands of HK sleaze should give this Cat III offering a look .
407787	865972	65233	7.0	Surprisingly bleak and unsettling piece of Japanese exploitation .	Koji Wakamtsu's " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " is a classic pinku eiga film . Wakamatsu was raised to be a farmer but made his move to the big city and tried his hand at being a gangster and a convict before he found his true calling as Japan's most notorious experimental movie director , who made over 30 films between 1963 and 1974 , many of them too raw and disturbing to be shown in theaters but acclaimed at fine-film festivals . " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " tells the story of of Poppo ( Mimi Kozakura ) , a young girl raped ( for the second time in her young life ) by a gang of street ruffians one August night in Tokyo . Left bleeding on a rooftop , she survives the night and meets Tsukio ( Michio Akiyama ) , a fellow teenager with problems of his own . Together they explore the darker side of life and sex , with Poppo's suicidal obsessions matching similar threads in Tsukio's unsuccessfully published book of poetry . The joy they find in each other inflames their rage at the unjust world around them , and their love engenders a tragic killing spree . " Go , Go Second Time Virgin " is a beautifully shot film and the cinematography is brilliant . Most of the film is in gorgeous black-and-white , with a few tinted sequences and a full-color flashback to Tsukio's unfortunate orgy experience . So if you are a fan of Japanese art-house exploitation give this one a look . .
407063	865972	359658	7.0	Pretty nasty and nihilistic Mark Savage's debut .	" Marauders " tell the story of two sociopaths named JD and Emilio on the wild murder and rape spree in Aussie countryside . Paul Harrington's character runs over one of the psychos by accident , injuring the loon's leg and does a hit and run . A pursuit follows that leads to an apocalyptic showdown in the deep Australian woods . " Marauders " plays like a nasty homage to " Death Weekend " and " Last House on the Left " . Despite some amateurish acting and atrocious dialogue the film offers lots of violence and is hugely entertaining . The often talked rape scene is quite tame , especially in comparison to the scenes of sexual violence shown in Savage's disturbing " Defenceless " . The production values are pretty high and the editing is pretty good . Overall , I enjoyed this little Aussie exploitation flick and you should too , if you are into violent no-holds-barred cinema .
407826	865972	65424	7.0	Sleazy and rather unsettling thriller .	A handsome and lonely gym teacher Eddie Collins can't perform sexually due to his constant watching of his mother undress while he hid in her closet as a child . His only recourse is to kill the women he tries to sleep with and stash them in a pigeon hutch on his roof . He hires a prostitute to dress as his dead mother , the only way he is able to achieve sexual gratification . . . " The Arousers " is the first film of director Curtis Hanson . Originally shot in 1971 under the title " Sweet Kill " , this film lingered on the shelf until 1973 when executive producer Roger Corman had Hanson shoot two days of nudity inserts to spice-up the film . Angus Scrimm of " Phanatsm " fame has a small cameo here . Overall , this is a good piece of sleaze from the early 70's that should satisfy the exploitation fans out there looking for plenty of nudity , sex and violence . .
406849	865972	235433	7.0	Vastly enjoyable hicksploitation sleaze .	When a group of developers threaten the land of three backwoods mountain-dwelling brothers Ezra , Benny and Monroe , the homeless rednecks must resort to murder to defend their property . However the trio starts killing not only construction workers , but also camping vacationers . . . Very enjoyable exploitation trash with nasty drawn out rape scene , rampant misogyny and racist overtones . This low-budgeter is surprisingly tense due to its nasty subject matter . Almost all the characters are despicable , the acting is bad and the gore is amateurish . Still if you enjoyed such redneck terror movies like " Trapped " or " Hunter's Blood " you can't go wrong with " God's Bloody Acre " . I'm really surprised that this film didn't achieved cult status yet .
407538	865972	83155	7.0	Sleazy , dirty and enjoyable trash .	A sadistic priest Paul Vogel played by Jesus Franco himself makes his living by writing pornography for a S & M magazine . His publisher Franval praises Vogel's work for its authenticity unaware that the mad priest draws inspiration from the exorcisms and inquisitions he undertakes in order to save sinners ' souls . Vogel discovers that Franval and his cohorts indulge in satanic games and embarks upon a new series of divinely inspired murder . Of course there is a team of investigators hot on the trail of this sadistic sex murderer . I saw this film under the title " Exorcism " . It's a typical Franco's chock full of sleaze and misogynistic violence . There isn't much gore to speak of , but plenty of whipping , rough sex and knife play . The killing scenes look very cheap and the story is paper-thin . However if you are a fan of depraved smut give this one a look .
407325	865972	74356	7.0	Okay old-fashioned Sasquatch flick .	Pahoo and Rives , two anthropology students from the University of Chicago travel to Oil City in Louisiana to track down Sasquatch . They try to find old-timer Joe Canton , whose best friend was allegedly snatched in the swamps by Sasquatch , but run into a wall of hostility and opposition from the locals . " Creature from the Black Lake " is a Bigfoot flick , unfortunately Sasquatch is rarely seen throughout . Still the rural atmosphere of Louisiana is well-captured , the acting is okay and there is a few suspenseful moments . The downside of this is that the film becomes absorbed by its portrait of a small town to the extent of almost everything else . Still if you are a fan of Bigfoot horror flicks like " Night of the Demon " , " Shriek of the Mutilated " or " Screams of a Winter Night " you may give it a look . .
407168	865972	98662	7.0	Okay horror flick , but nothing special .	" Witchtrap " has a special place in my heart , mainly because it was one of the first horror movies I have seen . Yep , the acting is pretty awful , the script is laughable , but the gore effects ( for example a head explosion ) are nicely done . There are some good moments in the picture , which is well-directed by Kevin Tenney ( " Witchboard " , " Night of the Demons " ) and has some pretty cool music too . Finally how can you go wrong with the film , where Linnea Quigley gets killed by a shower ! ! Recommended .
408088	865972	65669	7.0	Mildly interesting adaptation of H . P . Lovecraft's story .	" The Dunwich Horror " is the second H . P . Lovecraft adaptation from art director Daniel Haller ( " Die , Monster , Die ! " ) is actually another flawed attempt to capture the unimaginable darkness of Lovecraft's literature on film . Sandra Dee plays Nancy Walker , a young college student who is lured into the mysterious house of Whateley by the creepy young warlock Wilbur Whateley ( Dean Stockwell ) . The local community has long suspected that the whole Whateley family-Wilbur , his grandfather ( Sam Jaffe ) , and his mother , who is in an insane asylum-is unholy , and soon their suspicions are confirmed . Wilbur intends to use Nancy as a human sexual sacrifice that will unleash dark powers-represented by his monstrous twin brother , who exists in another dimension-across the earth . Occult professor Dr . Armitage ( Ed Begley ) discovers what Wilbur's up to , and with the aid of Nancy's roommate ( Donna Baccala ) , he tries to stop it . " The Dunwich Horror " is a psychedelic little horror film that offers some interesting visuals . The film is slow-paced and there is absolutely no gore . It relies more on suggestion than shocks , so if you like old-fashioned horror give it a look . .
408167	865972	70116	7.0	Artistic sleaze .	A young woman is interrogated by the police and the judges , suspected of being a modern witch . The girl who shared her apartment has been found dead with a pair of scissors impaled through her heart , as she lay attached to the bedposts . Apparently , the girl does have powers , to make all people around her fall prey to her spell , glissing progressively into desire , lust and the unknown . Alain Robbe-Grillet has to be one of the most innovative French novelists and film-makers . His " Successive Slidings of Pleasure " is a wonderful film that contains plenty of surreal moments and lots of sleaze . The movie itself is truly unique and bizarre , so fans of unusual European art-house exploitation won't be disappointed . So if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works give this one a look . This is my first journey into Alain Robbe-Grillet's visions and I'm highly impressed !
407608	865972	69745	7.0	A nice piece of sleazy erotica from Jesus Franco .	Lina Romay plays Countess Irina Karlstein , who is the last in the line of the vampires . She sucks the life force from her victims during sex . The film opens with wonderfully erotic sequence in which Irina wanders out of the early morning mist , clad only in a belt , knee-high boots and cape . " Female Vampire " is very slow-moving , but it offers plenty of nudity , sex and lesbianism . Franco clearly takes a voyeuristic delight in Romay's body and activities . There is no horror whatsoever , but if you like Jesus Franco's movies give this one a look . I still think that there are far better movies made by Franco , for example " Faceless " , " Bloody Moon " , " Barbed Wire Dolls " or " Women in Cellblock 9 " . My rating : .
407299	865972	80506	7.0	Pretty strange .	" Cataclysm " ( 1980 ) is one of the strangest and most disjointed horror movies ever made . The film offers plenty of creepy atmosphere , but overall story is very confusing . The acting is pretty bad , but it's nice to see a horror veteran Cameron Mitchell as a detective . There is also a little bit of gore , but not too much . So if you're a fan of bizarre Satanic horror movies give this one a look . Recommended . My rating : .
407284	865972	58484	7.0	Malaysian horror classic .	I just bought this mega-rare horror film on Malaysian VCD and I'm highly impressed . Back in the 1950's " Pontianak " series was very popular in Malaysia . Cathay Keris was the first studio to produce ' pontianak ' films . " Pontianak " , " Dendam Pontianak " and " Sumpah Pontianak " all starred Maria Menado as the hideous vamp-the first ghoul in the history of Malaysian cinema . Unfortunately she didn't appear in " Pontianak Gua Musang " , which was the sequel to " Pontianak Kembali " . This time the female vampire lives in the cave . She is a pontianak who comes out after dark . She terrorizes local people , seducing men and then killing them . This mildly creepy Malaysian vampire flick is beautifully shot and well-directed by B . Narayan Rao . It also offers an insight into Malaysian local culture , so I was pleased . So if you like Asian horror give this forgotten gem a look . .
407620	865972	207093	7.0	Decent slasher thriller about murderous sheriff .	Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break . Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley , Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins . . . " Shallow Grave " is a pleasant low-budget surprise . The cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . Especially the second murder is pretty grim . The murderous sheriff isn't one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done . The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting . .
407675	865972	106335	7.0	Great arthouse drama .	Peter Greenaway is one of the most unique directors at work in cinematic arthouse today . He made several truly original movies like " The Falls " ( 1980 ) , " A Zed and Two Noughts " ( 1985 ) , " The Pillow Book " ( 1997 ) etc . " The Baby of Macon " is pretty demented with the scenes of cannibalism , incest , rape and gore . The film is difficult , challenging , brutal and darkly beautiful . A baby is born from a supposed virgin woman , so a chain of hysteria about divine intervention in the birth takes place . The scene when stunningly beautiful Julia Ormond is gang-raped is really hard to watch-it is not graphic , but her agonizing screams are quite convincing . Highly recommended if you want to see totally challenging piece of art .
406955	865972	99222	8.0	Short and sweet !	" Carmilla " is an adaptation of a short story written by Sheridan Le Fanu . The film is really pleasant to watch with noteworthy performances by Ione Skye and Meg Tilly . It's atmospheric and strangely sensual with plenty of spooky locations . Highly recommended especially if you're into very subtle horror cinema . My rating : !
407155	865972	90094	8.0	Vastly entertaining horror comedy about deadly yogurt .	The Stuff is a sweet-tasting white yogurt which is discovered bubbling out of a hole in the ground by a factory worker . It tastes delicious and is soon packaged as a dessert heavily promoted and becomes a nation-wide sensation . Nobody seems to know quite what the ingredients are and it has the unfortunate quality of turning consumers into Stuff-addicted zombies . A little boy named Jason sees The Stuff moving and soon learns of its nefarious effects by observing his blissed-out family , while industrial spy Mo Rutherford sees it in action . " The Stuff " is a gorgeous horror satire and it mixes horror , comedy and action . The special effects by Ed French and David Allen are cool and the acting is great . Highly recommended .
407562	865972	78077	8.0	A slow-moving and eerie French ' zombie ' film .	Chased from her train by a bloodthirsty madman sporting a face of decaying flesh young √âlisabeth flees into the desolate and bleak French countryside . Unbeknownst to our heroine an experimental pesticide has tainted the region's grape harvest and all imbibers of the local vintage have been viciously mutated into deranged zombie-like killers . It's hard to classify " The Grapes of Death " as a zombie film , mainly because it features living people driven into murderous rage by contaminated wine . As the most of Jean Rollin's works " The Grapes of Death " is set in an eerily isolated and lifeless landscape loaded with empty fields , misty bridges and crumbling houses . There is a good deal of gore including particularly gruesome decapitation and lovely full-frontal nudity scene provided by Brigitte Lahaie . .
406787	865972	93608	8.0	A beautiful film .	Jorg Buttgereit's " Nekromantik " is one of the most taboo-breaking horror films ever made . Very few movies talk openly about necrophilia ( " Aftermath " , " Kissed " , " Buio Omega " , " Lucker " , " Love Me Deadly " , " Nekro " , " Mosquito the Rapist " ) , however this subject is quite fascinating because it draws links between sex and death . Rob ( Daktari Lorenz ) cleans different places and removes the corpses whenever there was a murder , or an accident . One day , Rob's girlfriend ( Beatrice M . ) has an idea to steal a corpse and to play with it . The corpse is treated like the third person and all of them make a perverted threesome . But one day Rob is fired from his work and his girlfriend dumps him , and leaves with the dead lover . For Rob it's a beginning of complete madness . . . " Nekromantik " is pretty gross-there is plenty of yucky gore on display . The ending is truly sick and memorable . So if you like extreme cinema give this one a look . .
407400	865972	462703	8.0	Pretty effective psychological chiller .	An expedition team led by Choe Do-hyung marches on toward the Antarctic Point of Inaccessibility , one of the most difficult places to reach on the planet Earth and trodden upon only once by a Soviet team in 1958 . Min-jae , formally trained in mountain climbing at Switzerland and in awe of the charismatic Do-hyung , is joined by the bookish navigator Young-min , the rather thuggish but sharp communications expert Seong-hoon , the genial cook Geun-chan and the electronics specialist Jae-kyung . When Min-jae discovers an old journal left by a British expedition 80 years ago , he begins to notice odd parallels between the journal entries and his team's experience . " Antarctic Journal " is an impressive horror film that slightly resembles " R-Point " and " The Thing " . There are some genuinely unnerving moments and Kenji Kawai's score evokes the utterly cold and relentless atmosphere of Antarctica . Unfortunately the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered . Still it gets a solid from this viewer .
407871	865972	984118	8.0	Shocking and disturbing with heavy psychological context .	The depraved plot of " Snuff 102 " is easy to follow : three girls are kidnapped and subjected to sadistic torture and murder by a masked Snuff Maniac . One of them is pregnant . She is tied to a chair , beaten , her fingers are cut off , she is knocked to the ground and finally the killer stomps her head , stomps her pregnant belly then rapes her with a large knife . During this shocking sequence Mariano Peralta was beaten and injured by the angry viewers of Mar Der Plata Festival . " Snuff 102 " has also two shocking scenes of animal cruelty involving monkey and butchered pig . They are nasty and disturbing . The acting is fairly convincing and the atmosphere of total evil is well-captured . However the film asks several uncompromising questions about the evil side of a man . Give it a look , if you can stomach it . .
407191	865972	100663	8.0	Sleazy slasher .	" Sorority House Massacre II " is actually one of my favourite low-budget slasher flicks . It is extremely dumb , but it offers plenty of gore and nudity , so I wasn't disappointed . Five pretty girls buy a creepy old house which was the scene of brutal massacre some years earlier and decide to turn it into their sorority house . Soon they encounter their weird neighbour , Orville Ketchum , who tells them that he was the one who found the bodies . They also mess with a ouija board and the slaughter begins . . . " Sorority House Massacre II " is a much better film than the dreary original . The gore is plentiful and the girls look incredibly hot in their sexy nighties . Gail Harris is pretty memorable as the leader of the sorority house and Peter Spellos is wonderful as the fat , creepy neighbour from hell . Overall , I enjoyed this film and you should too if you like sleazy slasher films . Give it a look . .
406790	865972	80646	8.0	Great study of deadly obsession !	" Don't Go in the House " is an obscure early 80's horror film that seems to be forgotten by many horror fans . The film is well-made and slickly directed by Joseph Ellison , a talented musician and a screenwriter . Donny Kohler is a tormented young man . His mother tortured him by holding his bare arms over a gas burning stove . He grows up to be a psycho who delights in burning young women with a flamethrower inside his steel paneled bedroom crematorium . The film is filled with truly sick atmosphere and there is one of the most sadistic burning killings ever captured on screen . The underlying theme of child abuse is also taboo-breaking . " Don't Go in the House " is often trashed by some politically correct people-still it beats most of the crap being put out today . Highly recommended .
408128	865972	80603	8.0	Great trash movie ! ! !	Atrocious acting , nonsensical script , very low production values : all these elements can be found in Alvin Rakoff's " Death Ship " . So why am I not going to trash this little movie ? It's simple , I really like this film for those very reasons . It is everything low-budget horror movie should be , yet still manages to tell its story and generate a considerable amount of unease and dread . A cruise ship is destroyed by another ship ( the Death Ship ) , killing most of the crew . The few survivors of the crash , who include the captain ( George Kennedy from " Creepshow 2 " or " Just Before Dawn " ) , a family of four and some others , decide that it would be a good idea to board the same ship that crashed their cruise ship . The death ship then starts killing its new victims . Despite so many bad comments " Death Ship " is still watchable . It has some really creepy scenes and memorable moments . Yes , the film doesn't make very much sense , but that's not what director Alvin Rakoff intended . Instead he puts together nightmarish sequences surrounded by an eerie sounds . You have to be a real horror fan to fully appreciate " Death Ship " . Check this one out , it's pretty good . Highly recommended .
407483	865972	274546	8.0	Very good horror film .	Rick Bota's " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " is a straight-to-video horror film that offers plenty of morbid atmosphere . Kirsty Cotton ( Ashely Laurence ) is married to Trevor ( Dean Winters ) . This guy knows very little about Kirsty's past . He also sees really strange things and is slowly losing contact with reality . " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " is easily among the best three " Hellraiser " films . It's surpassed only by the first two films . Unfortunately there is only a little bit of gore , so splatter freaks will be disappointed . In many ways " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " has a similar look and feel to " Hellraiser : Inferno " , in which we find ourselves watching a stark reality that is very much our own . Of course there is also the matter of Pinhead , the Cenobites and the famous puzzle box . However they only make a token appearance toward the movie's end . Still this film is quite good , so if you're a fan of " Hellraiser " movies give it a look . .
407564	865972	452702	8.0	Creepy and effective horror flick .	David Fox is driving down a dark county road as his wife Amy sleeps in the passenger seat . He comes across a raccoon in the middle of the road , swerves to miss it and soon after some bickering about minor things , they are forced to stop at a service station in the middle of nowhere when the engine starts making weird noises . A mechanic just about to leave for the night helps them out , but a mile down the road , the car breaks down . They hike it back to the motel adjoining the service station and the manager Mason tells them the garage will open in the morning . The couple books a room for the night , discusses their soon-to-be finalized divorce and becomes quickly freaked out when the phone rings with no answer and someone begins pounding on the room's doors . David tells the manager and the disturbances stop . When finally settling down for the night , David finds some video tapes that show people being gruesomely murdered and after perusing some of them , he realizes the murders happened in the room they are in . " Vacancy " is an almost non-stop thrill ride . The main characters are sympathetic and there is enough suspense and violence to satisfy fans of horror . The snuff movies shown are actually quite disturbing , still the amount of gore is minimal . If you want well-acted and intense horror film look no further and give " Vacancy " a look . .
407648	865972	98482	8.0	A very pleasant surprise !	When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of " The Lost Boys " ( 1987 ) . To my surprise " To Die for " is a really good movie . It's a little bit corny at times , but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts . This is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times . Highly recommended .
407472	865972	74687	8.0	Very good Paul Naschy's film .	A trio of witch hunters arrive in town to ply their trade . While this is happening , the daughter of the magistrate agrees to sell her soul to the devil for the ability to take vengeance on the man who killed her lover . " Inquisition " is a fine directing debut of Paul Naschy . There is plenty of gratuitous nudity and the torture scenes are fairly nasty and shocking . Scenes such as a rotating , spiked gyre approaching the bared breast of a female victim and the obscene pulling of another unfortunate victim's nipple are as unsettling and savage as any scene from competing films such as Adrian Hoven's classic 1969 witchcraft flick " Mark of the Devil " . Naschy's portrayal of the devil is fantastic as is his performance as a witch hunter Bernard . Give this one a look , if you are a fan of Jacinto Molina or Spanish horror in general . .
407915	865972	69840	8.0	Great crime thriller .	16-year-old Candy Phillips is brutally abducted by a trio of amateur criminals hoping for a hasty ransom exchange . Burying their innocent captive alive in the hills of Southern California with only a small tube for air , the threesome-sultry blond Jessi , her sadistic brother Alan and maladjusted Army vet Eddy-suspect things aren't as they appear when Candy's father doesn't show at their agreed rendezvous . Growing anxious as paranoia sets in ' the kidnappers fear their meticulous plan is crumbling and begin a downward spiral into depravity , mutilation and cold-blooded murder-with Candy helplessly trapped in the middle . " The Candy Snatchers " is a classic exploitation flick . The script by Bryan Gindoff is surprisingly intelligent , the cast is great and there are some violent set-pieces . The film is obviously influenced by the Charles Manson murders , so if you are into 70's grindhouse exploitation cinema give it a look . .
408102	865972	78503	8.0	Sweet little short .	" Within the Woods " is largely known as the prequel to " The Evil Dead " . This 30-minutes film was created to sell investors on the idea of " The Evil Dead " . The film is extremely low-budget and the story is minimal . Still there is plenty of gore to satisfy fans of American horror . Bruce Cambell plays Bruce , who gets zombified . Ellen Sandweiss plays his girlfriend , Ellen . However she doesn't get raped by a tree in this film , though . The cinematography is grainy and the moving steady / shaky camera-a Raimi trademark-probably made it's debut here . " Within the Woods " is rather tough to find , but if you get a chance watch it . Highly recommended .
406755	865972	79207	8.0	Truly disgusting and misogynistic giallo . Spoilers	" Giallo a Venezia " is , without a doubt , one of the sleaziest movies ever produced in Italy . Along with " The New York Ripper " ( 1982 , Lucio Fulci ) and " The Killer Is Still Among Us " ( 1985 , Camillo Teti ) this is possibly the nastiest giallo ever made . The film begins with a double murder on the Venetian docks : architect Fabio ( Gianni Dei ) is stabbed with a pair of scissors , while his wife Flavia ( Leonora Fani ) is drowned . The fact that Flavia was pulled back from the water by the killer after being drowned , intrigues inspector DePaul ( Jeff Blynn ) and his assistant Maestrin . As they begin investigating friends of the couple , such as Marizia ( Mariangela Giordano from " Burial Ground " and " Malabimba " ) , they soon discover that Fabio was in fact a sex crazed cocaine addict , who could only achieve sexual gratification by violence and sick voyeurism put upon his wife . During the investigation Marizia begins to receive threatening phone calls from ex-lover and soon after that a series of brutal murders is set in motion . Director Mario Landi ( " Patrick Still Lives " ) fails to create any suspense or mystery . What Landi looses in mystery he more than makes up for with some of the most brutal violence and sex ever put on the screen . The violence in " Giallo a Venezia " is truly shocking . A prostitute is stabbed repeatedly in the crotch in one of the most sickeningly audacious murder sequences ever filmed . Another gory highlights include Giordano being tied naked to her kitchen table and having her leg cut off with a handsaw by the killer and Marizia's lover being doused in gasoline and set alight . The long sex scenes are pretty explicit and it's quite obvious that Landi's intentions were only to show as much sex and blood as he could . To sum up , if you like sleaze and extreme gore then you should check this one out . Recommended !
407258	865972	498353	8.0	More amusing than the original .	The survivor from the " Hostel " Paxton is quickly decapitated and the film follows three young and supple female art students heading for a relaxing weekend at a Slovakian spa . And where better to stay than an inexpensive hostel ? Of course the three girls are finally abducted and taken to the torture house . Roth introduces the other side of the torture business as we follow two friends who have paid to maim and kill . In my opinion " Hostel 2 " is actually tamer than the original . There is some nasty gore on display including throat slashing via scythe and castration ( an obvious nod to Joel M . Reed's exploitation classic " Bloodsucking Freaks " ) , but Roth does show some restraint here , even cutting away to make one demise occur off camera . The film is also more funny and amusing than the first one . Overall , it's a pretty decent follow-up , so give it a look . .
407741	865972	341266	8.0	Very creepy horror film .	" Bhoot " is a supernatural horror movie set in urban jungle of Bombay . Vishal ( Ajay Devgan ) , a stock analyst and his wife Swati ( Urmila Matondkar ) move into a new apartment . The fact that the previous occupant died jumping off from the balcony doesn't deter Vishal . He doesn't inform his wife about that tragedy . Eventually , she finds out and then creepy things do happen . She loses sleep and begins to experience strange incidents , illusions and nightmares . The truth is horrifying . " Bhoot " is a wonderfully suspenseful horror film made by Ram Gopal Verma ( " Raat " ) . The cinematography is breathtaking and the atmosphere is so thick that you could cut it with a chainsaw . The climax is pretty disappointing , though . A must-see for fans of Hindi horror . .
407732	865972	104139	8.0	Amusing .	Dr Evan Rendell or Dr Giggles from the title wonderfully played by Larry Drake is , along with officer Joe Vickers ( Bobby Ray Shafer ) from " Psycho Cop " series , one of the funniest psycho killers ever created on film . " Dr Giggles " is an enjoyable slasher film filled with gore and black humour . The film is well-directed and acted and is simply fun to watch . It's quite suspenseful at times , and some of the killings are rather unpleasant ( like when he castrates one guy ) and grotesque . Recommended for horror fans .
407083	865972	22913	8.0	Great horror classic from early 30's .	" Freaks " is one of the most controversial horror films from the 30's , mainly because director Tod Browning hired as the actors real sideshow freaks . It does have a rather unsettling effect , but I think that really does work for the film . Browning builds up a great amount of suspense with the good use of locations , story and lots of atmosphere . The ending , where we see freaks crawling in the mud , is pretty creepy . Anyway check this one out-it's worth watching .
407211	865972	203635	8.0	Strangely similar to John Carpenter's " The Fog " .	The title of " The Living Skeleton " is actually misleading , because there isn't living skeleton in the film . However the underwater sequence of meeting skeletons is truly unforgettable . The film opens with bang : there is a massacre on board of a ship which predates recent US hit " Ghost Ship " . There are striking similarities between Hiroshi Matsuno's film and John Carpenter's famous horror hit " The Fog " : a quiet coastal village surrounded by the fog , a local priest with a creepy secret and a ghostly ship with bleached skeletons on board , which haunts villagers on the land . There is also a bit of subtle necrophilia thrown in and a female ghost with long black hair . " The Living Skeleton " written by Kyuzo Kobayashi of " Goke Bodysnatcher from Hell " fame surely is delirious experience . It's a crying shame that it's currently out of print . If you liked it be sure to check out obscure Austrian horror film " Dark Echo " from 1977 , which may also inspired " The Fog " .
407327	865972	81229	8.0	The goriest Sasquatch flick of ' em all .	The action opens at a hospital , where a bunch of doctors and a cop are talking to this guy with a cloth over his face to cover his hideous injuries . Apparently he's the only survivor of a recent massacre and the cop wants to know what happened . The guy on the hospital bed is a Professor Nugent from the local college and he tells of how he'd got interested in recent reports coming from the mountains-reports of bizarre murders linked with Bigfoot sightings . Intrigued he assembles a search party of willing nubile students to go with him and hunt for this Yeti . They go looking and the bloodbath ensues . . . " Night of the Demon " was originally banned in the UK , Germany and Norway due to its gore content . Sure , it offers lots of violence and gore including a notorious scene where a motorcyclist gets his penis graphically ripped off while urinating , but some of the murder scenes are downright hilarious . The film does have more than twice as many deaths as your average body-count flick . Overall , " Night of the Demon " is well made with reasonable acting , a competent storyline and an interesting monster . Give it a look .
408145	865972	67384	8.0	Very odd and convoluted giallo .	Aldo Lado's stylish 1971 giallo " Short Night of the Glass Dolls " is the story of Gregory ( Jean Sorel ) , a reporter who is found dead in a Prague park . However his brain is alive as we can hear his frantic thoughts . It appears that his beautiful girlfriend Mira ( Barbara Bach ) has vanished without a trace and Gregory , along with his reporter pal Jack ( Mario Adorf ) , work to uncover the secret of a mysterious group of Prague's wealthy elite who operate inside the mysterious Klub 99 . " Short Night of the Glass Dolls " is a fine Italian giallo . The plot is bizarre and rather unpredictable and there is a decent amount of sleaze . Ennio Morricone again provides the music . It should be noted that this film is pretty hard for me to classify as a giallo in the traditional sense as it contains no black-gloved assassin . Still it's worth checking out for fans of Italian horror .
406847	865972	67488	8.0	Creepy religious horror .	" The Night God Screamed " is obviously inspired by murderous activities of Charles Manson and his ' family ' . The film is unavailable at this present time on DVD . It mixes relentless suspense and unsettling undertones of religious fanaticism . Jeanne Crain stars as the widow of a murdered preacher who is later systematically stalked and terrorised by the same crazed religious cult once led by twisted Jesus freak Billy Joe Harlan and responsible for her husbands death . Very effective suspense flick which easily maintains a nail-biting sense of tension . The central performance of Jeanne Crain is excellent . She plays the woman on the edge of total breakdown . All in all " The Night God Screamed " is a well paced , highly effective and suspenseful little shocker steeped in a chilling , uneasy sense of twisted religious mania .
407143	865972	85609	9.0	Truly bizarre horror film from Hong Kong .	" Red Spell Spells Red " is one of the rarest HK horror films in my collection . I managed to get this extremely obscure piece of gory horror on VCD whilst being in Kuala Lumpur . In a big cave an evil dwarf sorcerer is performing a bizarre ritual . Suddenly four righteous sorcerers enter the cave and attack him . In the subsequent struggle they wound the dwarf sorcerer fatally and throw him into a stone coffin . They carefully seal the coffin . The present time : a group of photographers investigate the legend of the evil sorcerer . They enter the cave and break the seal . Red smoke gushes from the coffin and ghastly things start to happen . A young man is killed by an unseen force , another is killed by the woods that came alive . When dozens of scorpions attack the people in the village , it seems clear that village is cursed . An old sorcerer tries to remove the powerful spell . " Red Spell Spells Red " is a dark and suspenseful horror film that left me stunned . The tone of the film is serious , albeit there is a little bit of humor to be found here . The scenes of scorpions attacking people are creepy and horrifying . The film has some grisly scenes of animal cruelty thrown in for a good measure . Some pigs are killed with a knife and in truly disgusting moment a possessed man kills a hen by eating it alive in front of the camera . The gore effects are surprisingly effective for example a hand is cut off after the sting of the scorpion or a woman is attacked by a fishing net and wooden beams . The film is almost impossible to find , so don't hesitate to get a copy . .
407565	865972	110620	9.0	Interesting experimental vampire film .	Dracula's daughter Nadja wanders New York City , melancholy and driven by her need for blood . She seduces and drinks from the depressed Lucy . Meanwhile Lucy's husband Jim is asked to help his friend Van Helsing who has been arrested for staking Dracula . But then the two of them realize that Nadja is drinking from Lucy . As they try to hunt her down , Nadja and her self-described ' slave ' Renfield flee back to Rumania . " Nadja " is a post-modern vampire flick which is actually a black-and-white reworking " Dracula's Daughter " ( 1936 ) . The film was produced by David Lynch who also played a small cameo as a morgue attendant that gets hypnotized by Nadja . The film is splendidly photographed in a glorious black-and-white and offers tons of mesmerizingly dreamy atmosphere . Overall , " Nadja " is much better than overrated and too philosophical " The Addiction " . The soundtrack by Portishead and The Verve is fabulous too !
407106	865972	814685	9.0	Brutal and savage French horror .	" Frontieres " by Xavier Gens plays like the berserk and utterly deranged French version of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " Hostel " with the family of bloodthirsty Neo-Nazis instead of stereotypical redneck crazies . The violence with the exception of the great and gory band saw scene is rather suggestive and wasn't explicit with the camera panning away or jump cutting almost all the gory bits . Still " Frontieres " is a very intense and visceral experience that will surely please the most hardcore horror fans . The killings are pretty brutal in their extremity , the acting is fine and some scenes are incredibly intense . I enjoyed the music in this flick , which was excellently blended into the action . The plot goes like that : running from Paris the group of youths end up taking refuge at a run-down motel on the Luxembourg border presided over by the Von Geisler family and is thrown into bloody nightmare . The two older " sisters " entice the guys with a vigorous foursome while the marginally less depraved youngest girl-plucked from her real family years earlier to be a breeding vessel for this one-assists our heroine when she is eyed up as representing new blood to continue the family line . .
407257	865972	126004	9.0	A poetic horror flick from Jean Rollin .	" The Rose of Iron " is easily one of the most hauntingly beautiful horror flicks made by French maestro Jean Rollin . The film tells the story of a young couple , who venture into a very old and very large cemetery , eventually getting lost within it's walls . Throughout this time , a mind game between the two arises and begins to battle . Eventually Francoise Pascal's character adopts to her surroundings . " The Rose of Iron " is a wonderfully Gothic mood piece , which is primarily set in a cemetery . The film is loaded with hauntingly dark atmosphere of utter hopelessness and there are some surreal situations for example lonely clown walking through the cemetery corridors . Give this lovingly poetic horror flick a look . .
407817	865972	285853	9.0	Another great rape-themed violent pink from Yasuharu Hasebe .	A Japanese policewoman is raped by a black-gloved truck driver in a very stylish and unsettling rape scene . After the sexual assault the woman becomes obsessed with rough sex and rape . " Attacked ! " is not as vicious as " Assault ! Jack the Ripper " or " Rape ! 13th Hour " , but sleaze comes quick and heavy in this misogynistic exploitation classic . The classical score is awesome and welcome change from usual jazz scores of Hasebe's violent pink flicks . For fans of Nikkatsu's Roman Pornos or pinku eiga cinema in general " Attacked ! " is a must-see . Finally big thanks for fertilecelluloid for giving me an opportunity to watch this unfairly forgotten and ignored violent pink . .
406887	865972	221928	9.0	Creepy ! Spoilers	After watching such overrated horror movies like " The Blair Witch Project " , " Scream " or " The Sixth Sense " finally here is the film which really delivers the goods . Of course it's quite similar to " The Shining " ( 1980 ) , but honestly I don't care . The atmosphere is really creepy , the acting is excellent and the ending literally blew me away ( I love that Fulciesque zombies in the basement ) ! There is no gore-just a well-constructed mystery that is best viewed late at night . Check out this truly eerie film !
406882	865972	87050	9.0	Pretty atmospheric .	After reading some negative comments on this film it seems to me that many of those reviewers hate horror movies . If you don't like horror , then leave this genre alone ! ! ! Go back and watch some Hollywood big-budget trash ! ! " Children of the Corn " is an enjoyable horror film with a few creepy scenes and some good shocks . The acting is decent enough , and the atmosphere of an isolated town ( Gatlin ) is well-captured . I've seen the first four parts of this series and they are not really bad ( want some crap-check out " Witchcraft " series ) Enough said-try this one if you enjoy watching horror movies . Very atmospheric score too !
406958	865972	69375	9.0	An enjoyable piece of grainy horror !	William Girdler's " Three on a Meathook " is obviously inspired by the Ed Gein case . It's a very bizarre tale of a twisted murder and cannibalism in the tradition of Tobe Hooper's " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " . There's plenty of nudity and cheesy gore , however the film is not as gory as the title suggests . Still there are some good kill scenes , a good amount of blood plus a nice plot twist at the end . The film is quite slow at times , but its low-budget gives it a raw look . Highly recommended and a good companion piece to " Daddy's Deadly Darling " ( 1972 ) - another grainy horror masterpiece from early 70's .
407892	865972	228687	9.0	Surreal , grotesque and wickedly humorous film .	Karl Horak and his wife Bozhena are unable to have a child ; the man carves a stump of wood into something that resembles a baby , and little Otik comes to life . Bozhena loves it with all she has and they name Otik . But Otik's appetite grows and grows , it soon devouring the cat , the postman and neighbors . Only the neighbor's inquisitive daughter realizes that the Horak's have given birth to an Otesanek , a creature from fairytale that supposedly grew in size devouring everything around it . " Little Otik " by Jan Svankmajer is a wickedly humorous film . Svankmajer's traditional obsession with rampant consumerism and folk tales is clearly visible . Veronika Zilkova gives an absolutely hilarious performance , treating the piece of wood as though it were a baby with steadfast certainty-bathing it , clipping its nails , changing its diapers , rubbing cream on its butt . A must-see for fans of surreal world of Jan Svankmajer .
408098	865972	88745	9.0	Truly disturbing and sickening giallo . Spoiler	Along with " Giallo a Venezia " ( 1979 , Mario Landi ) and " The New York Ripper " ( 1982 , Lucio Fulci ) this is possibly the nastiest Italian giallo ever made . It is based on the still unsolved series of murders in Florence and that lack of closure makes its over-the-top sexual violence all the more unsettling . A criminology student named Christina Marelli decides to write her thesis about a mysterious serial killer terrorizing couples in lover's lane . As she starts searching around she gets obscene phone calls . Is the killer her boyfriend Alex or maybe someone else ? This forgotten Italian giallo is truly shocking . The scenes of sexual violence and mutilations are extremely well-done ( brilliant special effects by Roberto Pace ) and disturbing . A young couple is murdered in a tent . The boy has his throat cut open , while the girl is shot several times . The killer then slowly slices off her right nipple and cuts apart her vagina in close-up . This sequence is so graphic and sick that I almost threw up during it . The film is also suspenseful and bizarre in some scenes ( check out the Devil's Bar moments ) . " The Killer Is Still Among Us " is certainly not for everybody , but if you like extreme cinema give this one a look . Highly recommended .
407943	865972	120401	10.0	Authentically original and twisted little gem .	" The Ugly " is one of the best horror / thrillers I have ever seen . I think that it ranks up with such terrifying genre classics like " Maniac " or " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " . Paolo Rotondo plays Simon , a psychopathic serial killer who , having been abused by his domineering mother as a kid , decides to murder lots of people . " The Ugly " is a really suspenseful , psychologically disturbing film which has to be seen to be believed . It's also very violent , even by today's standards-the killings ( mostly razor slashings ) are cold blooded and brutal . Sure , the blood is black , but it goes well with dreamlike atmosphere of the film . The acting is excellent , especially the performance by Paolo Rotondo is amazing . Simon is the guy we worry about finding hiding behind our doors when we come home late at night . The guys like he really exist in our world . All in all I'd wholeheartedly recommend " The Ugly " for those who want something much more intelligent and unsettling than any mainstream slasher flick . .
407674	865972	290673	10.0	Brilliant !	I am very surprised to see all of the negative complaints towards this film . Like " I Spit on Your Grave " or " I Stand Alone " , " Irreversible " is only rubbish to those who don't understand it , or don't want to understand it . Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman ( outstanding Monica Bellucci ) is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage . Her boyfriend ( Vincent Cassel ) desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him . The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening , but at least the film can't be accused of eroticizing , trivializing or glamourizing rape , something many mainstream movies are guilty of . It actually shows that rape is a brutal and disgusting act . Congratulations should go to this stunningly beautiful actress for her brave performance . It's obvious that women should be treated with respect , unfortunately this is the kind of a sexual violence women are dealing with everyday and everywhere . In that case Cassel's savage behaviour is completely justified . The scenes in " Rectum " are genuinely nightmarish and infernal . The film will leave you shaken and desolated , so if you want to see something totally mind-shattering , then " Irreversible " is a must-see . An absolute .
407693	865972	120737	10.0	Stupendous !	I've never been a fan of fantasy ( not read Tolkien's books ) , but Peter Jackson's " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " totally blew me away ! This masterpiece is simply amazing ! Everything here is excellent : the acting , the sets , the special effects by Richard Taylor etc . The film was shot in New Zealand for example in Matamata ( Hobbiton ) , Kaitoke Regional Park ( Rivendell ) , Glenorchy ( Lothlorien ) etc . My favourite characters are : Aragorn ( Viggo Mortensen ) , Frodo Baggins ( Elijah Wood ) , Galadriel ( Cate Blanchett ) and Boromir ( Sean Bean ) . The film is full of incredibly beautiful images ( the Dark Riders galloping on their horses etc . ) , some scenes like a fight with a huge Troll in Moria are literally unbelievable . I still can't believe that Peter Jackson , who was responsible for such excellent ( and extremely gory-I might add ! ) horror movies like " Bad Taste " ( 1987 ) and " Braindead " ( 1992 ) created this masterpiece . I only hope he'll return to his splatter origins . - what else ? I am waiting impatiently to see the following two parts .
407373	865972	166924	10.0	" This is . . . an illusion ! "	Another amazing masterpiece from excellent illusionist David Lynch ( " Blue Velvet " , " Eraserhead " ) . Great acting ( two lead actresses Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are simply gorgeous ) , incredibly complex and mysterious plot and very dreamy atmosphere . The music by Angelo Badalamenti is also amazing ! ! ! If you like Lynch check out movies by Dario Argento ( especially " Inferno " and " Suspiria " ) , E . Elias Merhige ( " Begotten " ) and Andrzej Zulawski ( " Possession " ) - three other great illusionists of the cinema ! ! ! Absolutely recommended ! !
408119	865972	93677	10.0	Just another great giallo thriller . Spoilers	" Opera " is a great film with some wonderful , imaginative imagery . An opera singer ( Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes . This idea of the needles comes from the fact that Argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies . " For years I've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films . I film these images because I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away . So I thought to myself ' How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes ? ' The answer I came up with is the core of what " Opera " is about . " - says Argento . Plenty of suspense , wonderful cinematography and brutal , gory murders . One guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound , Daria Nicolodi gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole , etc . For anyone who hasn't caught this one yet , give it a try . Highly recommended .
407893	865972	454839	10.0	Brutal , gory and intense horror film .	" Broken " by Adam Mason and Simon Boyes tells the story of a single mother named Hope and her six year old daughter who are kidnapped by the nameless maniac called The Man and kept in the middle of woods . Hope is subjected to brutal humiliation and is treated as a slave . She becomes more and more resistant and finally extracts the revenge on her captor . " Broken " is an extremely violent and intense horror film that certainly provides plenty of sickening gore and general nastiness for fans of extreme survival horror . The small cast is great , the cinematography is fantastic and the gore effects are disturbingly realistic . The opening sequence is definitely not for the squeamish-we see a poor woman , who is tied around the neck to the tree and the only way for her to escape is by using a razor blade sewn inside her stomach . The climax is also incredibly vicious and violent as hell . " Broken " formerly known as " Heart Eater " centers very much on the character of Hope . Nadja Brown delivers a strong performance and Eric Colvin is excellent as the nameless survivalist . Give this film a look-it's a truly bleak , cruel and strikingly memorable experience in survival horror .
406878	865972	104684	10.0	Truly mind-blowing action flick .	Director John Woo has a powerful and explosive style that will leave you breathless after watching this extremely violent action flick . The camera is everywhere flying from place to place . And there are people everywhere . All of them firing a gun or two . I have never seen such energy before . The violence in " Hardboiled " is very brutal and well directed . The last half hour of this film , which take place in the hospital is full of inventive action sequences . Chow Yun-Fat is really good as a tough policeman and it's also very nice to see Anthony Wong ( " Bunman : Human Meat Pies " , " Dr Lamb " , " Bullet in the Head " ) - what a great performance ! I like Hong Kong-action films by John Woo . Anyway , if you're tired of Hollywood's action trash , then this one is a must-see . Recommended !
407091	865972	80707	10.0	Brutal to the bone .	" The Exterminator " is a one hell of a vigilante thriller . This legendary flick obviously influenced by Micheal Winner's " Death Wish " has Robert Ginty as a Vietnam vet , whose friend is badly injured by street gangs . James Glickenhaus ( " Suicide Cult " , " The Soldier " ) creates an ultra gritty atmosphere of wonderfully seedy New York . " The Exterminator " is extremely brutal : the double murder in the whorehouse really stands out-you can see a half naked fat guy getting shot in the kidney at point blank range with a pistol loaded with poison bullets . Grisly and unforgettable ! Add also one of the most brutal decapitations ever captured to film and you have a winner . All in all , I'd strongly recommend this film to everyone interested in vigilante flicks - " The Exterminator " is surely an unforgettable experience . .
407504	865972	96046	10.0	Totally overlooked and creepy horror flick !	After robbing an army payroll , the thieves escape in a stolen plane , taking the pilot and his daughter as hostages . While flying away , one of the robbers dives out of a plane with all the money . He lands on a small farm house with a large corn field and strange looking scarecrows all over it , hanging on crosses . He steals an old truck and begins to escape through the large corn field . But the other robbers land the plane to go after him and the money . Soon they are all murdered by evil scarecrows . This is surely one of my favourite horror movies . It is loaded with some eerie and creepy shots of the woods and the scarecrows hanging on crosses . There is also some gore and the makeup effects made by Norman Cabrera ( " Fright Night 2 " ) are extremely well-done . The killings are brutal , especially the scene when one robber is stabbed in his face . If you like the gory stuff , you'll love this one . Highly recommended .
407931	865972	116075	10.0	Another Brian Yuzna's masterpiece .	Doctor Feinstone is a dentist . He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool . Suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realises that behind everything clean , there is decay . He starts to torture his patients . . . Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist-he is completely believable . There is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque . Highly recommended . " The Dentist 2 " is also worth checking out !
407165	865972	80761	10.0	" This place is cursed ! "	" Friday the 13th " became the second highest grossing film of the summer of 1980 ( behind " The Empire Strikes Back " , whose profits were not nearly as great when you factored its budget ) . Although somewhat inspired by Carpanter's " Halloween " , this bloody slasher went on to become a true classic in it's own right , which was mostly due to depiction of the murders . The killings in " Friday the 13th " were brutal and gory , and considered quite shocking for it's day . There are four memorable gore scenes in this movie : 1 ) a female counsellors ( Robbie Margan ) throat is slit 2 ) Kevin Bacon gets an arrow through his neck 3 ) his girlfriend ( Jeannine Taylor ) gets an axe in the face 4 ) finally Mrs Pamela Voorhees ( Betsy Palmer ) is decapitated . The make-up and cosmetic effects were made by Tom Savini . The scene at the end , when Jason ( Ari Lehman ) suddenly appears , has the biggest shock impact of the whole film . The plot is simple : A guy named Steve Christie ( Peter Brouer ) re-opens the supposedly cursed Camp Crystal Lake ( Camp Blood ) , only to have the nubile young counsellors viciously murdered by an unseen killer during the rainstorm which isolates the camp . Anyway , if you haven't seen this splatter classic , try to find this one . Definitely recommended .
407861	865972	254686	10.0	Truly harrowing film .	" La Pianiste " aka " Piano Teacher " is very strong psychological terror tale about destructed mind , feelings and the reasons behind that . " La Pianiste " doesn't explore violence like " Funny Games " did , but these are very important films and tell about real life and real people . The film is very disturbing psychological study of female who has very severely damaged mind and extremely sick sexual life and habits . Occasionally almost unbearably powerful and extremely harrowing ; the final scene made me cringe . Isabelle Huppert is jaw-droppingly excellent as the main character-her performance is only comparable to Suh Yung's performance in " Seom " / " The Isle " ( 2000 ) . Highly recommended-Michael Haneke is a genius !
407344	865972	416315	10.0	Surprisingly brutal and horrifying horror flick .	" Wolf Creek " is very loosely based on a true story of the real-life serial killer Ivan Milat , who was convicted of killing 7 backpackers and dumping their bodies in the Belangalo Forest , Australia . One of his intended victims , a young British guy , managed to escape and was instrumental in identifying the killer . The filmmakers have used a lot of key points from this case for the movie , for example the physical description of Ivan Milat , the fact that he used a hunting knife and was a gun fanatic . Also he sliced through the spinal cord of most of his victims , paralyzing them before stabbing , shooting , beating and or sexually assaulting them . The personal belongings of his victims were eventually found in a police raid on his home , sleeping bags , tents , backpacks , etc . So the actual story of Wolf Creek isn't true , but the psychopath is a reality . That's why " Wolf Creek " is so terrifying and intense . Director McLean perfectly uses the environment to create an atmosphere of total dread and hopelessness . The film is grainy and offers some fairly brutal scenes of violence and torture , especially towards the female characters . John Jarratt is perfect as Mick Taylor , a sadistic psychopath who stalks tourists . The story is pure , uncluttered and horribly believable , gripping the viewer and never allowing for one second any doubt that the horrors we are witnessing could indeed happen to anyone . Overall , " Wolf Creek " is an intense , decidedly visceral experience that should satisfy fans of relentless horror . .
407442	865972	165623	10.0	Extremely brutal , disturbing and nihilistic serial killer film .	Gerald Kargl's " Angst " is one of the most depressing and disturbing serial killer movies ever made . It's loosely based on an actual crime case-in 1980 Werner Kniesek from Salzburg horrendously murdered three people . Later he told the judge " I just love it when women shiver in deadly fear because of me . It is like an addiction , which will never stop " . " Angst " is often compared to John McNaughton's " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " , but it's even more unsettling and hopeless . The film is shot with a strong use of high-angle shots and hand-held camera-work . It tells the story of disorganized serial killer , who is released from prison . First he tries to strangle the female taxi driver , but she manages to kick him out of the car and escapes . The killer flees through the forest until he reaches a huge villa , where the family of three lives . In the orgy of extreme violence he murders them . A disabled and mentally retarded son on wheelchair is slowly drowned in a bathtub in a truly agonizing sequence , a middle-aged mother is strangled in her bedroom and finally her adolescent daughter is stabbed to death with a bread-knife . The killer viciously mutilates her corpse and rapes her post-mortem . All of this is shown in unflinching detail that made me squirm . " Angst " is a hauntingly realistic portrayal of disorganized serial killer on the loose . This disturbed guy is a serious threat to every human being crossing his path . Erwin Leder as the killer is incredibly convincing . The murder sequences are so savage and shocking that you'll need an iron stomach to watch them . The camera work by Zbigniew Rybczynski is simply stunning and the film looks like semi-documentary . " Angst " is easily one of the most gut-wrenching serial killer flicks I have ever seen . It makes " The Silence of the Lambs " and " Seven " look like kindergarten stuff . Highly recommended , but not for the easily disturbed . .
407990	865972	71519	10.0	One of my favourite horror films from Hammer .	I love all Hammer horror films simply because they are a part of my childhood . " Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell " is great-the acting is really good and the film is quite scary in a subtle way . Peter Cushing as a Baron Victor Frankenstein / Dr Claus Victor is as always amazing , and Dave Prowse is very believable as an ugly monster . There's a bit of gore , which is quite unusual for Hammer horror . Fans of " Scream " and similar teen-oriented garbage won't like this one-you have to be a true horror fan to fully appreciate this film . However if you like old-fashioned horror , give this one a look .
407518	865972	71431	10.0	Excellent zombie film .	Jorge Grau's " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " is a very stylish and atmospheric zombie film that chooses quality over quantity . It has only 7 or 8 zombies , but it's still one of the best zombie flicks I have ever seen . The film may be pretty slow-moving for some horror fans , but there are several exciting set pieces . The acting is excellent and there is some nasty gore on display . I liked especially the scene where one of the nurses has her breast ripped off before being ripped to shreds . The film is set in the English countryside and there is enough suspense to satisfy fans of horror . " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " is pretty much considered a classic by some , so if you like zombie films give it a look . A must-see !
407631	865972	107894	10.0	Pretty good sequel . Spoilers	In my opinion , " Psycho Cop Returns " is a lot better than its predecessor . It's more gory and sadistic than the original " Psycho Cop " . This sequel pits a group of after-hours partying yuppies against satanic cop from hell Joe Vickers . Gore galore ensues until only a couple of yuppies are left alive . " Psycho Cop Returns " features more sex and nudity than usual slasher flick . The director Adam Rifkin delivers also on the gore-the killings are more brutal as well . There is an eyeball violence , one guy is shot in the mouth etc . The party scene is pretty entertaining and gore-hounds should be satisfied by the lively death scenes . All in all , " Psycho Cop Returns " is a really good sequel and deserves a spot on any collector's shelf . I'm glad I picked up a copy as it was well worth the money spent . Highly recommended .
407089	865972	161635	10.0	Incredibly graphic and sadistic .	" Guinea Pig : Flowers of Flesh and Blood " deserves to be called one of the sickest horror films ever made . This notorious pseudo-snuff sickie is about a guy who dressed as a Samurai warrior kidnaps beautiful Japanese woman and hacks her up in excruciating detail , occasionally pausing to recite some hai-ku . This part of " Guinea Pig " series does contain some very convincing gore effects of hands , arms and legs being cut off in unflinching detail . The worst scene for me is the eye-gouging which is the most realistic . The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen , believing this one to contain actual murder gave the copy to the FBI . I've seen only this one and " Devil's Experiment " and I enjoyed both of them . So if you like extreme gore and cruelty you won't be disappointed . Even the most-hardened gore-hounds will wince ! Also recommended : Nacho Cerda's " Aftermath " .
407088	865972	161634	10.0	Shocking and disturbing .	The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . She is beaten savagely , spun around in the chair endlessly , has her finger nails pulled , animal guts are thrown at her , hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle ( really sick and nasty scene ) . The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . Of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . I have seen also " Flowers of Flesh and Blood " which is more gory and sadistic , but less disturbing . Anyway , this one is a must-see for horror fans !
407333	865972	478988	10.0	Brilliant movie rendition of H . P . Lovecraft's " The Call or Cthulhu " .	" The Call of Cthulhu " is a silent film made by director Andrew Leman of the H . P . Lovecraft Historical Society . The film is shot in high-contrast black-and-white that recalls the best German expressionism . The result is an almost vintage tale of hair-raising mystery full of truly bizarre dreams , murderous Eskimos and bloodthirsty cultists that culminates in the revelation of an unspeakable horror . The orchestral soundtrack is captivating , the special effects are surprisingly well-made and the sets for the sunken city of R'leyh look creepy . " The Call of Cthulhu " is easily one of the best adaptations of Lovecraft adaptations I have seen to date . Check it out along with Ivan Zuccon's massively underrated " The Shunned House " . .
407859	865972	82818	10.0	Very dark and grim horror film .	Romano Scavolini's " Nightmare " is one of the grimmest horror movies ever made . Baird Stafford is extremely believable as George Tatum , a schizophrenic serial killer who murders uncontrollably . He has been supposedly cured of his psychological disorder due to a new magical medicine . In actuality the cure doesn't work very well , because Tatum starts killing people . " Nightmare " isn't as good as " Maniac " - still there are some genuinely atmospheric and chilling moments . The opening scene is extremely creepy . The killings are cold-blooded and brutal . The gore is pretty strong-the climatic double axe murder scene is incredibly gory . To sum up , if you're a fan of early 80's extreme horror give this one a look . Highly recommended .
407946	865972	82933	10.0	Excellent !	" Possession " is a weird horror film by Polish art house director Andrzej Zulawski . Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill ( " Event Horizon " , " Omen 3 " ) star as a couple who's marriage is on the rocks . Adjani claims to have a lover-she has a surreal affair with an octopus creature . First of all this movie is great , so every horror fan should check it out . Obviously some people don't get it-maybe they were expecting some cheesy horror bloodbath , who knows ? Of course there's some exceptional gore including where Adjani slices into her own neck with an electric carving knife and a scene where she has a miscarriage on the metro which is quite disgusting ( and possibly due to this scene the film was classified as a video nasty ) , but the atmosphere is really creepy and weird . The acting is awesome-especially an incredible performance by Isabelle Adjani . Watch this film with an open mind and an open heart , and I guarantee you will love " Possession " .
406760	865972	78935	10.0	Possibly one of the most brutal and disturbing horror movies ever made . Spoilers	" Cannibal Holocaust " is a very shocking and powerful movie . A documentary film crew goes into the jungle of South America and is never seen of again . A search and rescue team is sent , but find only their remains and their stock of film they had shot about the last remaining cannibal tribes . The video footage is later screened in America . As shown in the footage , the film-makers found horrible death by the cannibal tribes after messing with them and committing crimes such as raping their women and killing their animals . Brilliant photography by Sergio d'Offizzi , great musical score by Riz Ortolani and some of the most horrifying scenes of cruelty ever captured to the film . Truly the violence is graphic as hell-lots of brutal animal butchery , rape , dismemberment , castration etc . One scene that I shall always remember is a part when the film-makers drag a giant turtle ashore and proceed to hack off it's legs , one by one , with a large machete , finishing up with beheading the beast . I like the other cannibal films I've seen , but they don't come close to " Cannibal Holocaust " . Recommended only for Deodato fans and those who want something much more disturbing than any mainstream slasher picture-all others stay away . A masterpiece .
