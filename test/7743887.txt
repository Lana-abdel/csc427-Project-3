400744	7743887	83459	1.0	A Comedy Classic ? Or the P . I . T . T . S . ?	Originally to have been called ' Big Tis ' , ' O . T . T . ' ( ' Over The Top ' ) was an unsuccessful attempt to transfer the anarchic humour of the Saturday morning children's show ' Tiswas ' to a late-night slot . All the cast ( with the exception of Sally James ) signed on . The level of humour was epitomised by its title sequence , featuring an animated nude woman . Critics blasted it as ' juvenile ' . The problem with the show was that once the novelty of seeing ex-kids presenters showing their bums and using bad language had worn off , there was nowhere for it to go . Alexei Sayle must have realised this - he jumped ship mid-season . ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' parodied ' O . T . T . ' in ' The Radio Times ' as ' Only Too Terrible - The Adult Version Of ' Play Away ' ' . In reply to the user who claimed that I did not understand the humour , let me point out that I did - I just did not care for it . For me the only really funny moments came from Bob Godfrey's animations . The show had some surprising celebrity fans , though . Victoria Wood defended it to the hilt on the B . B . C . - 2 discussion show ' Did You See ? ' . As the series progressed , various new ideas were tried out , such as the infamous nude men dancing with balloons . But when it ended Central Television announced that it would not be coming back . Tarrant produced as well as starred , and afterwards expressed doubt as to whether he would ever work again ( nowadays the bad publicity would be enough to keep it on air for years ) . I agree with the user who claimed that ' O . T . T . ' was ahead of its time . Unfortunately , that does not make it a good thing . All television series have their supporters and detractors . If some people fondly remember this show , that's fine by me . I personally wish that Tarrant and co . had stayed with ' Tiswas ' for another year instead of making ' O . T . T . ' .
401644	7743887	83458	1.0	The Simon Dee Of The ' 80's ?	' The Noel Edmonds Late Late Breakfast Show ' had a difficult birthing period ; the early shows began with a title sequence reminiscent of the old Simon Dee show ' Dee Time ' , depicting Noel racing to the B . B . C . T . V . Centre in various forms of transport . The late D . J . John Peel figured prominently , as did the Scottish comedian Leni Harper ( whatever happened to her ? ) . Poor ratings necessitated a rethink . Noel decided his co-presenters were to blame and , ditching them , brought in fellow D . J . Mike Smith . There was also a lawsuit threatened by Peter Dulay , ex-producer of the British version of ' Candid Camera ' . Dulay claimed that a ' Gotcha ' stunt involving a conveyor belt was a steal of one of his ideas . The case was letter settled out of court , with Dulay receiving a credit as ' Consultant ' . Despite these troubles , ' Late Late ' caught on with viewers , and would have run years had not viewer Michael Lush died whilst rehearsing a stunt . Noel later commented : " It nearly ruined my career . " . Didn't do Michael much good either , Noel .
401361	7743887	260601	1.0	Harry Does A Hancock	One minute , you're up , the next , you're down . Tony Hancock quit the B . B . C . at the height of his popularity to do an inferior show for I . T . V . , an experience from which he never recovered professionally . Harry Enfield , alas , didn't learn from this , quitting the B . B . C . to make this horrible Sky One production , which , apparently , even he didn't bother to watch . Enfield is an amazingly talented comedian , but alas was let down by the atrocious material , shoddy production values and mediocre supporting cast . Paul Whitehouse and Kathy Burke were sadly missed . Some of Harry's new characters - such as James Bond's idiot brother , and the sex-mad fisherman - look and sound like rejects from ' The Fast Show ' . One sketch consists almost entirely of profanity . Unlike Hancock , Harry is thankfully still with us , and one hopes he gets his career back on track one day . ' Brand Spanking New Show ' was a criminal waste of his talent , an insult to Harry's many fans , for which the people behind it deserve a good spanking .
401115	7743887	810762	1.0	An Audience With The Woodentops Would've Been More Fun	When I heard about this , I thought it sounded interesting . How , I wondered , would they fit a street inside a small television studio to face an audience of D-listers ? Then I watched and realised my mistake . It was the cast of ' Coronation Street ' , not the street itself . Silly me ! With L . W . T . now part of Granada , I suppose a programme like this was inevitable . In terms of sheer inanity , it almost beat ' Russell Harty Meets Upstairs , Downstairs ' from way back in the ' 70's . Isn't it bad enough that we have to endure the ' Coronation Street ' gang doing whatever it is they get paid huge sums for ( it sure ain't called acting ) most week-nights , without this bilge being inflicted on us ? If I want bad singing , dancing , jokes etc . , I'll go to my local workingmen's club , not stay at home and watch the telly . At least there you get the privilege of heckling . The reverential tone displayed towards ' Coronation Street ' is disturbing to say the least . Its like watching a bizarre religious cult at work , preparing to hand over their cash and lay down their lives in a futile cause . ' Star Trek ' fans are often the butts of media sneers , yet soap opera addicts are regarded as nice , normal people indulging in a healthy obsession . Well , take it from me , there's nothing healthy about being obsessed whether or not Emily Bishop's remembered to put roses on Ernie's grave on the anniversary of his shooting .
401094	7743887	267212	1.0	Highly Questionable Time	Under the chairmanship of the late Sir Robin Day in the ' 80's , ' Question Time ' was a lively , stimulating political debate show . These days , however , it resembles ' The Muppet Show ' . We are told each week by David Dimbleby that the studio audience is composed of members of the public , yet I spotted the Chairman of the Young Conservatives ( as it was then called ) on one edition and he unsurprisingly agreed with the Tory Minister's line on Europe . It got me wondering just how many in that theatre are ordinary people , and how many are rabid Tory activists . Practically every question is anti-Labour . Apart from being grossly unfair it makes for dull , repetitive viewing . The quality of the quests is not what it was either , whereas we would once get John Smith , Roy Jenkins and Denis Healey , we now have to make do with Z-list celebrities Shilpa Shetty , Davina McCall , and that - boy - who - used - to - play - Nicky Tilsley-in-'Coronation Street ' . Basil Brush has not been on it yet , but one day he surely will . Probably the speaker who got up my nose the most was Ann Widdecombe , a rude , pushy woman disinterested in the views of others . The guests never miss a chance to play to the gallery . I found this out one week when the question was " Should a 16 year old be allowed to win the National Lottery ? " . A female S . N . P . councillor replied that the winner could use his / her winnings to pay for school tuition fees . As no-one laughed , she repeated the comment in a louder voice , until she got the desired effect . Occasionally someone makes a right twit of himself on the show . During a debate on whether the age of consent for gays should be reduced from 21 to 16 , a man in the audience commented : " I don't hold with it as it is defying God ! " to which Dimbleby responded : " So its alright to defy God at 21 ? " . The man was speechless . Then there was the subject of Colonel Qaddafi's chemical weapons factories - should they be bombed ? The questioner was adamant they should not be on the grounds that it was unsafe , but then proposed an alternative : " Send in commandos and get them to blow the place up ! " . Oh yeah , that would have been much safer , wouldn't it . A gimmick has recently been added - text messages flashing up on the screen . These witty comments range from ' Don't like his tie ' to ' what a funny looking woman ' . You come away no wiser about many of the issues being debated . Watch ' Newsnight ' instead .
401388	7743887	317200	1.0	The British Tragedy Awards , More Like	I look forward to ' The British Comedy Awards ' each year because it provides me with an excellent excuse to go out for the evening . This annual jamboree has got it all ; talentless , big headed ' comedians ' winning awards despite their shows being absolute rubbish ; incoherent , rambling ' thank you ' speeches ; endless close-ups of grinning nobodies in tuxedos , obnoxious behaviour from Jonathan Ross ( his belittling of Rod Hull was inexcusable ) was and , of course , loads of swearing . Wa-hay , lads ! Why do these people still think swear words have any shock value left ? I wasn't offended by Julian Clary's ' fisting ' comment because it was mild compared to what you normally hear at this non-event . Worse , the occasion lends a veneer of respectability to the most appalling shows . Dare to venture a mildly derogatory comment about , say , ' Little Britain ' and you'll get the reply : " How come it won a ' Comedy Award ' then ? " . I would love to know the criteria used to pick the winners . It would seem that the awards are handed out on the basis of how much publicity the winner's private life has attracted . Which explains why Michael Barrymore was so successful for so long . And as for ' Mr . Blobby ' winning an award , well it speaks for itself , doesn't it ?
401290	7743887	127369	1.0	" We'll Be Right Back After The Break ! "	' 3-2-1 ' is one of television's greatest enigmas . Though it ended two decades ago , even now I wonder from time-to-time : " Why ? " . Made by Yorkshire Television , it consisted basically of various formats bolted together ; game show , variety show , children's show ( Dusty Bin ) , all linked by a finger-twisting Ted Rogers . Poor Ted . Having made a name for himself on programmes such as ' Jokers Wild ' as a quick-witted comic , he then had the misfortune to find himself in this slop ( he later admitted that the early editions made him cringe ) . Ditto Fiona Curzon , who prior to becoming a ' 3-2-1 ' beauty had appeared in Granada's popular I . T . V . thriller show ' The X-Y-Y Man ' . And what of poor Caroline Munro , a one-time Hammer Horror starlet who had been in Bond and Sinbad movies , reduced to playing second fiddle to a dustbin ? Originating from Spain ( Margaret Forwood of The Sun said ' it was the most undesirable thing to come out of that country since bullfighting ' ) , it ran for nearly a decade . So someone must have liked it . What was its appeal ? Well , it had razzmatazzz by the bucketload ( Johnny Pearson's theme was the most bombastic ever written for the box ) , glamour ( a gang of Continental beauties called ' The Gentle Secs ' , one of whom - Mireille Allonville - had appeared in soft porn films ) , intrigue ( those cryptic clues would have baffled Sherlock Holmes ) , and the ever present threat of ' Dusty Bin ' . Initially , the bin was inert , but then they made him move . The sight of a grinning bin gliding across the floor of the studio sent a collective shiver up the spines of the nation . ' Dr . Who ' could not have done it better . One or two poor souls won it from time to time , and to compound their humiliation Ted then asked them to smile and wave at the camera . The worst thing about the show were the sketches , many of which seemed to have been originally written for ' Crackerjack ' . Some nights the cast looked genuinely embarrassed at having to perform them . The first episode had as a contestant a pre-Radio 1 Janice Long , who curiously neglected to mention that she was Keith Chegwin's sister ( this was years before ' Naked Jungle ' ) . The early shows featured Mike Newman , Chris Emmett , and Debbie Arnold making lame quips inbetween the questions . Emmett wheeled out his impression of then-Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan practically every week , but when Margaret Thatcher moved into 10 , Downing Street , political humour suddenly became noticeably absent . The show carried the credit : ' Production Associate Michael Sullivan ' . The late Mr . Sullivan was a top showbiz agent , meaning that a lot of the ' 3-2-1 ' guest-stars came straight off his books . A young Mark Heap appeared in one edition ( I'm sure he's proud to have it on his C . V . ) . Easy to be cynical now , but ' 3-2-1 ' was huge in its day . They could not get away with it today though . Could they ?
400615	7743887	563127	3.0	A Moving Experience !	Duncan , Dick , Andy , Kate and Gascoigne are fed up with having to share the same office , so they complain . The Hospital Secretary proposes they exchange offices with Loftus . But the doctors are still unhappy as they now have to walk longer distances to the operating theatre , while Loftus no longer has access to his private lavatory . Duncan hatches a plan to get Loftus to agree to change back . . . The late dancer and actress Wei Wei Wong appeared in numerous variety and comedy shows in the early ' 70's , as well as a small role in the Bond film ' The Man With The Golden Gun ' . Here she makes the first of two appearances in ' Doctor On The Go ' as a nurse . Its the only notable thing about this episode , which must have been written as a ' filler ' . Practically nothing funny happens in the entire half-hour , apart from Kate's " Mahogany ! Your hogany ! Anybody's hogany ! " , and that's not saying much . Derek Deadman crops again as a porter . ' Never The Twain ' fans will recall that he played the role of ' Ringo ' .
401371	7743887	591013	4.0	" You didn't tell us your surname was ' Nuts ' , Hazel ! "	The Goodies are nearly broke and freezing to death in their office . Then a sexy young woman named Hazel hires the lads to search for her explorer father , who went missing twenty years ago whilst searching for the lost tribe of the Orinoco . Using his diary , they recreate his journey step for step - and find themselves in Sevenoaks , Kent . . . Disappointing episode , boasting few film sequences . Bridget Armstrong would later play one of Patrick Cargill's ex-spouses in ' The Many Wives Of Patrick ' , whilst Roy Kinnear was famous thanks to ' That Was The Week That Was ' , ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , and many other shows . His character - Professor Nuts - has lived with the tribe for so long because they are the only people left in the world who laugh at his jokes ! The depiction of black people as grunting savages probably wouldn't go down well today , but attempting to impose today's standards on the past is totally pointless . You've just got to see it in the context of its time period . Funniest moment - Graeme's impersonation of Graham Kerr , the Galloping Gourmet , here renamed ' The Galloping Cannibal ' !
401510	7743887	675773	4.0	The Final Term Begins . . .	En route to Fenn Street , Hedges happens across a mother trying to discipline her unruly son . The boy does not want to go to school , so the teacher offers to take him . On arrival , however , he discovers the boy belongs at Weaver Street . No sooner has he taken the boy there than he runs off . Hedges finally begins lessons with new class 4C , but badly misses 5C , and reacts angrily when one of his new pupils makes a disparaging remark about Eric Duffy . The police look for Hedges , because the boy has not turned up for lessons , and show Potter an Identikit picture , based on details provided by the boy's mother , but the forgetful caretaker fails to recognise it . . . The day after the first episode of ' The Fenn Street Gang ' went out in Britain , its parent show was back . Alas , with most of the original cast gone , it was not the same . The fourth series of ' Please Sir ! ' is much like the seventh series of ' On The Buses ' in that respect . Even a brief appearance by Liz Gebhardt as ' Maureen Bullock ' at the start of ' Identitwit ' cannot conceal the fact that it feels more like an episode of ' Grange Hill ' . Interestingly , the new titles depict pupils blowing bubble gum , reading horror comics , playing leap frog etc . Shame they are not in the actual show . That running blonde in hot pants would have sent the ratings soaring ! Kate Williams appears as the boy's mother . She was soon to be seen in ' Love Thy Neighbour ' as ' Joan Booth ' , while Brinsley Forde , who plays ' Herman ' , was ' Wesley ' in the ' Please Sir ! ' movie . Funniest moment - Maureen making Hedges ' bed and finding his pyjama bottoms under Penny's pillow !
401436	7743887	563124	5.0	" Come on England ! "	Duncan , Dick and Andy are looking forward to a Saturday afternoon in front of the telly , watching a football game between England and Wales . So keen is he to see the English hammered the Scottish Andy is kitted out in Welsh national costume . But Duncan is unexpectedly recalled to duty . To spoil his friends ' fun , he tells Gascoigne that an old Busby Berkeley musical is on B . B . C . - 2 . Gascoigne is almost assaulted when he tries to change the channel . Loftus shows up , and the film is put back on . Dick pulls the plug out of the wall , and makes it appear as though the set has broken down . Just as they are getting into the game , two T . V . repair men take the set away , claiming they are part of a faulty batch . . . I remember reading an article in ' The Sunday People ' ( as it was then called ) in 1977 , which credited ex-doctors turned comedy writers Rob Buckman and Chris Beetles with having ' saved ' the ' Doctor ' series . This made no sense ( it was not renewed after this season ) , as their episodes are nowhere near as funny ( in my view ) as those of Steve Thorn and Paul Wolfson . This one is like the ' No Peace For The Wicked ' episode of ' Porridge ' in that the main character ( s ) is looking forward to a planned Saturday afternoon , only to be continually interrupted at every opportunity . But the two are worlds apart in terms of execution . To get revenge on Gascoigne for his continual interruptions , the lads trick him into thinking that an Italian patient ( played by Ricardo Montez of ' Mind Your Language ' fame ) has a mysterious unknown disease . Oh ha-ha . Funniest moment - the bit at the end where Gascoigne gets revenge on his tormentors by magnanimously sending them a television set to watch the match . However , it has no screen , valves or tubes , just a football dangling on a piece of string inside the box !
401236	7743887	162074	6.0	The Butler Of Billingsgate !	Made by A . T . V . , ' A Rather Reassuring Programme ' was a satirical comedy show from 1977 , hosted and produced by the late Ned Sherrin . One sketch was set in I . T . V . ' s comedy department , and featured John Junkin as a writer and Henry McGee as a hard-to-please producer . Ideas for various series were bandied about , only to be rejected . Then Junkin proposed a sitcom about Billingsgate Market fish porters . " Of course " , he added , " It could turn out to be another ' Down The ' Gate ' " . McGee shuddered . " Do you think the world is ready for another ' Down The ' Gate ' ? " . That should give you some idea of how highly regarded the show was at that time . Reg Varney had left ' On The Buses ' mid-way through its seventh ( and as it turned out final ) season , to land a show of his own on A . T . V . Entitled simply ' Reg Varney ' , it had our man singing , playing the piano , and playing bizarre characters in sketches ( such as ' The Monologue Man ' - dressed in flamboyant clothes , he constantly spoke in rhyme ) - basically , all the things he was not allowed to do on ' On The Buses ' . The show was a modest success . In 1975 , Reg felt that it was time for him to return to sitcom . He came up with an idea for a show about Billingsgate Market fish porters . Writers Roy Tuvey and Maurice Sellar fleshed out the premise . Reg played ' Reg Furnell ' , a fish porter very much like . . . Stan Butler . Except in one important respect - Stan was single , whereas Reg was happily married to the social-climbing Irene ( Dilys Laye ) , who was always trying to impress important people such as the bank manager , and would lose her cool whenever her husband came home late and stinking of mackerel . Reg's best mate was ' Old Wol ' , played by Reg Lye ( someone really ought to make a documentary about that man . After all , how many Australian actors can you name who have emigrated to Britain and made a living playing Cockneys , Northerners , Scotsmen et al ? ) . Reg and Old Wol had a different relationship to that of Stan Butler and Jack Harper , they were more like father and son than pals . The late Geoff Love wrote the cheeky saxophone signature tune , he had earlier written the excellent theme for ' Bless This House ' . I . T . V . had enough confidence in it to give it their prestigious ( for comedy at any road ) Wednesday 8 P . M . slot , usually reserved for ' The Benny Hill Show ' and ' The Tommy Cooper Hour ' . But it never caught on in the way that ' On The Buses ' had done . It was not Reg's fault . The scripts were not terribly good , and there was an insufficient mix of strong characters . Tony Melody played ' Len Peacock ' in the first season , and then Percy Herbert was brought on board in the second to play ' Mr . Preston ' - a ' Blakey'-styled authority figure . Instead of ' get that bus out ! ' he said ' get those crates moved ! " . Irene inherited some of Mrs . Butler's characteristics , such a tendency to display over-affection . It was just not the same , and viewers noticed . Reg might as well have stayed on board his bus . ' Down The ' Gate ' vanished from the airwaves in 1976 . Reg never did another sitcom . Plans to revive ' On The Buses ' in the late 1980's came to nothing . A . T . V . wiped the show soon after its screening , but canny old Reg used a video recorder ( yes , they existed then , albeit in a basic form ) to preserve seven of the twelve episodes , meaning that someday it might turn up on D . V . D . If it does , I think its fair to say that no-one will rush to acclaim it as a lost comedy classic . Its a pity they did not do instead a show in which Varney played a butcher with a twin brother - they could have called it ' Meat & Two Reg ' !
400841	7743887	956749	6.0	" I hope she gets turps all over her knickers ! "	Keen to secure a £3 , 000 decorating contact , Eric begins getting friendly with the very pretty Shirley Matthews . Sharon assumes he is two-timing her . Maureen tries to bust up the pair by masquerading as one of Eric's ' girlfriends ' . Outraged , Shirley storms out of the pub . Once she realises the truth , Maureen attempts to put things right . . . A Rowley / Baker episode of little merit . This being a family sitcom , there was never any danger of Eric's motives being anything other than honourable , his interest in Shirley is ( so he claims ) for ' business ' only . When I tell you that Shirley is played by the stunning Jan Francis ( she of ' Secret Army ' and ' Just Good Friends ' ) , you'll find his claims a little hard to swallow . The low point is Maureen's impersonation of a squeaky-voiced floozy . Aimi MacDonald she ain't . The late Kenneth Waller , later to play ' Grandad ' in Carla Lane's ' Bread ' , is seen briefly as a randy pensioner in a burger bar . Future ' Citizen Smith ' star Cheryl Hall appears as Shirley's mate ' Brenda ' . Funniest moment - when the ' End Of Part One ' caption appears , Peter Cleall and Liz Gebhardt start eating peanuts ( which Craven had earlier dropped ) off the table . From their expressions I'd say they knew this script was a loser .
401652	7743887	69609	6.0	Back To Basics ?	Produced by H . T . V . West , ' Men Of Affairs ' was a spin-off from the 1973 movie ' Don't Just Lie There , Say Something ' , adapted in turn from a hit stage farce . Rix reprised his role , but as Leslie Phillips was making ' Casanova 73 ' for the B . B . C . , Warren Mitchell ( in monocle and toupee ) replaced him . Each week , the perpetually randy Sir William got up to naughty business , persuaded the hapless Ovis to cover for him , usually very badly . Misunderstandings piled on top of misunderstandings , and of course this being the ' 70's there'd be lots of dolly birds in various states of undress capering around bedrooms , and hiding in wardrobes . Joan Sims provided welcome support as Sir William's harridan of a wife . For lovers of British stage farce , this was essential viewing . I don't know if it still exists in the archives , but if so its a pity it wasn't repeated during John Major's time as Prime Minister . The labyrinthine plots of sex and deception would have seemed startlingly prescient .
401146	7743887	675786	6.0	5C Brushes With Dearth !	5C is entrusted with helping local pensioners and looking after kids - tasks which , surprisingly , they excel at . The only person unhappy with the idea is Potter , who has been told by 5C that ' geriatrics ' is the name of a person ( Jerry Atrix ) coming to Fenn Street School to take his job . In disgust , he tears off his badges in the staff room , and flings his hat out of the window . One pensioner who proves difficult is Albert Dearth , who won't wash nor let anyone in his house to tidy up . Craven decides to give him help - whether he wants it or not . . . I suspect that this episode , along with ' Norman's Conquest ' was written to placate those critics who regarded ' Please Sir ! ' as a bad influence on the young . In the earlier programme , they took an interest in wildlife , here its old people and kids . The late Jack Woolgar specialised in playing cantankerous pensioners . ' Dr . Who ' fans will probably best remember him as ' Staff Sergeant Arnold ' in the 1968 classic ' The Web Of Fear ' . Funniest moment - Potter entering the 5C classroom wearing psychedelic boots !
400712	7743887	300805	6.0	When Lennie & Dianne Met Charlie	Lennie Peters and Dianne Lee ( or ' Peters & Lee ' as they were collectively known ) were a popular singing duo who came to prominence on Hughie Green's ' Opportunity Knocks ' in 1973 . Lennie ( who by the way was blind ) and the beautiful Dianne notched up several middle-of-the-road hits such as ' Welcome Home ' , ' Don't Stay Away Too Long ' and ' Rainbow ' . Following their appearances on A . T . V . ' s ' Des O'Connor Entertains ' , the couple were offered their own series , entitled ' Meet Peters & Lee ' , which ran for one season in 1976 . Interspersed with their songs were sketches featuring Charlie Drake , his first regular television series since ' Slapstick & Old Lace ' in 1971 . Drake had gotten into trouble with Equity after employing a non-union dancer in a pantomime he was starring in , and was effectively blacklisted for a while . ' Meet Peters & Lee ' got him onto the box via the back door . It has to be said , though , that these sketches were far from his best work . In one , he played a World War 2 pilot who lets loose his cargo of bombs , even though his plane has yet to take off . The show was a big comedown for the diminutive comic . Good for fans of Lennie and Dianne , bad for fans of ' The Worker ' . Peters & Lee continued to work in theatre and summer shows , but their popularity was never the same again after this . Eventually , they parted company . Lennie died in 1992 . Dianne went on to appear in Jim Davidson's X-rated pantomimes ( as did Charlie ) . The classic sitcom ' Citizen Smith ' made a delightful reference to the duo in one episode . Attending a talent contest in dark glasses , Wolfie reminds his girlfriend that an old lady asked them for an autograph . " That's because she thought we were Peters & Lee ! " , laughs Shirley .
400601	7743887	942711	7.0	" Dash ! Dash ! Dash ! "	Social climber Jennifer Corner has invited her new neighbours , the Wyatt-Pearsons , round for a friendly drink . Mr . Wyatt-Pearson is a city stockbroker , and Jennifer automatically associates the profession with good breeding . In the lounge she swiftly replaces Henry's portrait of a nude with one of a bowl of fruit . The children are playing in the garden . When Robin , the eldest , falls over he lets slip an expletive . Jennifer is appalled . Where has the word come from ? She suspects Henry . . . My my . How times have changed . A boy using a four-letter word is the basis for a sitcom plot . ' Children ' was created by Richard Waring , a specialist in forgettable , middle-of-the-road sitcoms in the ' 60's and ' 70's . His other shows include ' Batchelor Father ' , ' And Mother Makes Three ' ( also starring Wendy Craig ' ) and ' The Many Wives Of Patrick ' . They're guilty pleasures . Pleasant to watch but hardly groundbreaking . Wendy Craig's character is well-meaning but scatterbrained , a sort of British Lucille Ball . It wasn't until 1979 and Carla Lane's ' Butterflies ' that she would finally be rid of that persona . As ' Henry ' her devoted husband , the late Paul Daneman is rather good , bringing a much-needed touch of sanity to the proceedings . Waring comes up with several good lines , such as " Remember when you talked about The Pill ? You made it sound so interesting the kids wanted to try it ! " . ' Trudi Corner ' was played in the first two seasons by Roberta Tovey , who had been ' Susan ' in the ' Dr . Who ' movies starring Peter Cushing . Olaf Pooley , seen here as ' Mr . Wyatt-Pearson ' , would appear opposite Jon Pertwee's ' Dr . Who ' in the brilliant 1970 story ' Inferno ' . ' Children ' became a byword at the time for ' naff ' television comedy . much as ' Terry & June ' did two decades later . On the evidence of the solitary episode I viewed recently , its seems an unfair reputation . We are left in no doubt as to what the offending word ( Jennifer is seen mouthing the first letter ) is . I bet there were a few angry letters read out on ' Points Of View ' the following week all the same . Viewed in the context of its time period ( as all archive shows should be ) , its good fun . Funniest moment - Jennifer attempting to teach Robin how to swear like a true English gentleman ie . " Botheration ! Blow ! Dash ! "
400929	7743887	80231	7.0	When Hammer Rose From The Grave	The last official ' Hammer horror ' film - ' To The Devil A Daughter - was released in 1975 . That seemed to be it . Five years later , this I . T . V . series appeared . Despite the title it was actually made by I . T . C . Entertainment ( ' Lew Grade's House Of Horror ' didn't have the same ring , I suppose ) . The thirteen episodes were a mixed bag , many relying on gore and nudity for their shock value , rather than well written stories . Easily the best was ' The Silent Scream ' starring the late , great Peter Cushing . Great final shot ! ' Witching Time ' was pretty memorable too ( because Patricia Quinn and Prunella Gee both got their kit off ) . But there was little of the essence of the movie series that had scared audiences for two decades . The strongest influence came from ' Thriller ' , an anthology made by A . T . V . in the early ' 70's . ' Guardian Of The Abyss ' was the most Hammer-like episode , bearing a resemblance to ' The Devil Rides Out ' ( 1968 ) based on the famous Dennis Wheatley novel .
400860	7743887	957577	7.0	I've Gotta Horse	As a birthday surprise for Dennis , the Gang decide to buy furniture for his flat . They attend an auction , which Frankie disrupts by making unrealistic bids . Dennis has a surprise of his own - he buys a horse , which he calls ' Spitfire ' . With nowhere to keep the animal , he puts it in the stable where he works , and sleeps alongside it . But Spitfire steps on his alarm clock and Dennis oversleeps . The next morning , the stable owner finds them there and sacks Dennis on the spot . . . Poor Dennis . Having been arrested and suspected of committing suicide this season , now he gets the push from his beloved stables . Needless to say , his old school chums rally round , and attempt to sell the horse on his behalf . How marvellous it must have been in Fenn Street in 1971 ! The auctioneer is James Beck , on loan from ' Dad's Army ' . His performance as the fast-talking spiv ( not unlike Private Walker ) is the highlight of an otherwise humdrum Esmonde / Larbey penned episode . He was hotly tipped to be the new Sid James , but tragically died the following year . May Warden appears as a troublesome old woman . In 1973 , she would play a similar role in ' Billy Liar ' . Funniest moment - a flummoxed Dennis attempting to work out his personal finances , before opting to draw a horse instead . With gas and electricity bills rising constantly , I know how he feels !
401566	7743887	665451	7.0	Stan's Cashflow Problem !	Flat broke again , Stan borrows from ' Basher ' , who works at the depot . Basher wants his money back within a few days else he will show Stan how he earned the nickname . Stan wonders how to repay him . Salvation comes in the shape of Iris , whose mother is moving house . Stan and Jack agree to convey her furniture in their bus . Stopping off at a bookies to have a flutter , they are horrified to find the bus gone when they leave . . . Messrs . Wolfe and Chesney contributed not one script to the sixth season of ' On The Buses ' . They were probably too busy with ' Romany Jones ' , their other hit sitcom of the early ' 70's . Thanks to writers such as Bob Grant , Stephen Lewis , George Layton and Jonathan Lynn , their absence was not as serious as it might have been . This episode follows the same pattern as ' Cover Up ' in that Stan makes personal use of his employer's property , only to then be found out by Blakey . Rather than give the driver the sack , he simply stops the money out of Stan's wages . You'd think Stan would have learnt his lesson by now . Funniest moment - Arthur is fixing tiles on the kitchen wall . Nearby , Mum and Olive are baking a birthday cake for Aunt Maud . If I were to mention that Arthur's cement and Olive's icing are both yellow , can you possibly guess what happens next ?
400992	7743887	59988	7.0	Enchanting April	Such was the popularity of ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' in 1965 that a spin-off was planned . An episode of the second series - ' The Moonglow Affair ' - saw Solo and Kuryakin temporarily written out , and their places taken by agents ' April Dancer ' and ' Mark Slate ' , played by Mary Ann Mobley and Norman Fell respectfully . It did well , and a series was commissioned - but with two important changes . The lead roles were recast ; in came a young Stefanie Powers as ' Dancer ' and British actor Noel Harrison ( son of Rex ) as ' Slate ' . Leo G . Carroll , of course , played ' Mr . Waverly ' . I did not see this when it first went out , but viewed it recently . It is enjoyably daft hokum , with plots involving such unlikely ideas as a dog's fleas used to carry a microdot , a Kali statue coming to life and throwing daggers , the entrance to the lost city of Atlantis turning out to be in some caves in the Caribbean , an island colony of shipwrecked survivors , a health spa that makes its customers youthful , and Boris Karloff ( in drag ) as the head of a gang of killers who wear flat caps and speak bad Cockney . This hailed from the same era as ' The Monkees ' and ' Batman ' , and it shows . Powers is beautiful and glamorous , though it is a pity that ' April ' was not given more to do in the action department . In the last episode I saw ( ' The U . N . C . L . E . Samurai Affair ' ) , she was attacked by a frogman , and after putting up token resistance , went to hide while Slate dealt with him . She should have chucked him over her shoulder the way Mrs . Peel did in ' The Avengers ' . It does seem bizarre to call a show ' The Girl From U . N . C . L . E . ' and then depict its main character as a helpless bimbo heavily reliant on a male sidekick . Another mistake was the reuse of Jerry Goldsmith's ' Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' theme , here given a trendy new arrangement . I warmed more to Harrison's ' Slate ' . Obviously intended to be the show's answer to David McCallum , he is rather good as a foppish hero in the ' Jason King ' mold . But whose idea was it to cast a teenage boy ( ' Randy Kirby ' ) as an U . N . C . L . E . agent ? Robert Vaughn played ' Solo ' in ' The Mother Muffin Affair ' , at exactly the same time Harrison was guesting on the parent show . In the U . K . , ' Girl ' was shown in rotation with ' Man ' , but in the U . S . A . , they were screened more or less together . Viewers found two ' U . N . C . L . E . ' shows a week a bit much to take , and ' Girl ' was dropped after a single season . Less comedy and more action ( for April ) would have been beneficial for the show . Sam Rolfe's superb first season of ' Man ' should have been the blueprint for ' Girl ' . Best episode - ' The Atlantis Affair ' ( written by ' I am Legend ' author Richard Matheson ) Worst episode - ' The Paradise Lost Affair ' .
400867	7743887	956726	7.0	Duffy Versus The Doctors	Its Rag Week at The Duke Of York Hospital , where Maureen works as a nurse . She is chosen as their official Rag Queen , but a gang of loutish students kidnap her before she can be crowned . Duffy , Frankie and Craven rescue Maureen . However , Duffy's van is stolen by the students . Eric is furious with Frankie as he'd left him in charge of the vehicle . To make matters worse , the van contained a box in which is a wedding dress intended for Duffy's cousin Deborah . As the clock ticks down to the ceremony , Eric must find the van and retrieve the garment . . . A Rowley / Baker penned episode that has a strong ' Doctor In The House ' feel to it , what with the anarchic students and infantile pranks . Its not surprising that the writers wrote for ' Doctor At Large ' that same year . Its hard to say for sure but the hospital exterior looks like the same one used in that other show . ' Bernard ' , the leader of the students , is played by future ' Robin Of Sherwood ' star Nickolas Grace . Funniest moment - Frankie leaning against the window of Duffy ' s van , only for his hand to pass through it as there is no glass there !
401081	7743887	828935	7.0	A Hair Raising Time For Arthur !	Once again money is tight in the Butler household , and Stan cannot secure overtime as Blakey wants conductors not drivers . In desperation , he is forced to join the cleaning ladies . His first day in the job is not a success - he smashes a window on his own bus . Back home , Arthur is behaving in a furtive manner . Struck on a sexy clippie named Beryl , he tries to attract her interest by wearing a wig . . . A slight but amusing episode ; best appreciated by middle-aged men with an alopecia ( baldness ) problem ( I'm sorry to say I include myself in this category ) . No man likes to think of himself as losing his sex appeal , which is why many resort to the kind of desperate measures Arthur undertakes here . Of course , it fails miserably . Though Beryl is initially impressed , she sees through the deception when the doors to Stan's bus unexpectedly close , trapping Arthur's head , and causing the wig to fall off . Good work from Michael Robbins , particularly when he tries to justify buying the wigs . " When I came here , I had a full set of hair . I want it back ! " . Funniest moment - our first sight of Stan in his ' Mrs . Mopp ' gear !
401588	7743887	546889	7.0	" My dead husband has walked in through the door ! "	Syrie Van Epp digs up Phil Scrotty's final resting place - only to find he is not in it . Anticipating elimination by Miss Dunner ( June Watson ) of Dept . K for double-crossing them , he got someone to put blanks in her gun . So now he is on the run , and sleeping with the recently widowed Mrs . Abigail Whitebait . Except that she is not - her late husband has just been brought back from the dead , thanks to Robag ( Aubrey Morris ) . Van Epp wants Scrotty resurrected because he has important information . . . One of Twin Peaks ' most popular characters was a dwarf . Well , ' The Corridor People ' ( often likened to David Lynch's surreal series ) had one too - ' Nonesuch ' ( William Trigger ) . In a truly startling scene , Van Epp - dressed as a nanny - pushes a pram through a park . Clouds of smoke issue from it . It contains no baby , but a cigar-smoking Nonesuch , who proceeds to shoot a man called Whitebait - who is supposed to be dead anyway . If all this makes sense , I cannot have explained it properly . I am not going to waste time attempting to rationalise the events of this bizarre show . That way madness lies . Scrotty gets more air-time here than in the previous instalment , and a right pain he proves to be too . Not merely content with openly bragging about having conned both Dept . K and Van Epp , he allows an innocent man to be eliminated just so he can resume carrying on with his wife . Van Epp's base of operations is in a disused theatre , allowing for Scrotty and her to have some fun with clown masks . ' Robag ' is that wonderful actor Aubrey Morris , who specialised in eccentrics .
400751	7743887	555204	7.0	Terror In The Post Office !	Les wishes to buy a 25 pence postal order to go with his pools coupon . An easy enough task you might think . But at the Post Office he encounters problem after problem - firstly , he is mistaken for a robber , the cashiers run out of postal orders , he keeps losing his place in the queue , a gay man ( yes , its Roy again ! ) gets fresh with him , and finally , when he gets what he wants , posts the coupon to the wrong pools company . Easily the weakest of the ' Dawsons Weekly ' series , the one-joke script wastes the talents of not only Les and Roy but but also Avril Angers and Patsy Rowlands . I recall Dave Allen once doing a monologue on his early ' 90's I . T . V . series on the subject of Post Offices , and it was a heck of a lot funnier than this . Worth keeping to show to future generations what Post Offices were actually like . Funniest moment - Les , trying to get back into the queue , explains to a disgruntled man that he was behind Roy before , and a cashier yells : " Do you two poofs want serving or not ? " .

Suddenly , they are attacked by a group of ' schoolgirls ' , who make off with the weapon . Sloane tries to stop them , but is overpowered and thrown out of a speeding truck . Luckily he has managed to steal a ruby without which the gun is useless . Only two more like it exist in the world . Posing as an African king , Torque auctions the diamond to the highest bidder , hoping it will lure whoever has the gun into the open . The party most interested is Bannister , leader of an all-girl terrorist squad known as ' Sweethearts ' . But someone else is too - Anna , Sloane's Russian counterpart . . . This story is a virtual remake of ' Death Ray 2000 ' , which had not been transmitted in the U . S . A . at that point . The idea of Sloane of teaming up with a beautiful Russian spy was a nod to ' The Spy Who Loved Me ' , released two years earlier . Why does Sloane discuss the mission with The Director , with Anna only a few feet away ? Sloane's latest gadget is a comb that fires an incapacitating ray . Obviously of no use whatever to Xander Cage . . .
400801	7743887	59260	8.0	" I am not what I seem ! "	Released in 1964 , ' A Hard Day's Night ' was a movie classic . ' Help ' , which came out a year later , had the potential to be better still ; a bigger budget , colour , exotic locations , top-notch British character actors of the calibre of Leo McKern , Patrick Cargill , Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear . Yet despite all these plus factors , it turned out to be a major disappointment . Having wisely retained the services of director Richard Lester , producer Walter Shenson inexplicably failed to hold onto writer Alun Owen . Marc Behm and Charles Wood's script for ' Help ! ' is , frankly , dreadful . The plot - such as it is - concerns a mystic Eastern sect who pursue the Fab Four all over the world in an effort to recover a sacred ring , which has somehow gotten stuck on Ringo's finger . For sheer inanity , it gives the worst of Elvis Presley's celluloid efforts a run for their money . Much of the Goonish humour seems forced , and the cast constantly winking at the audience grows wearing . Sadly missed are Norman Rossington , John Junkin and Wilfred Brambell from the first film . John Lennon later likened ' Help ! ' to the ' Batman ' television series . I think it has more in common with ' The Monkees ' . Arch plots such as this were routine in that show . The decision to turn ' Help ! ' into a larger-than-life action comedy is the main reason for its artistic failure . The pseudo-documentary look of ' Night ' suited The Beatles down to the ground ; all they had to do was be themselves . Here they are required to react to bizarre happenings , and aren't able to convince themselves , let alone the audience . Their frequent cries of ' ho ho ho ' leads one to believe they were so high on pot they forgot they were making a film . Lennon's comment about how they ' became extras in their own film ' is accurate . With McKern , Cargill and Spinetti hamming it up outrageously , and Eleanor Bron looking stunningly sexy in Julie Harris ' costumes , how could it have been otherwise ? The best gags in ' Help ! ' are visual , such as The Beatles simultaneously entering four houses and being reunited in a single room , and Patrick Cargill getting out of a small plane to be greeted by a massive flight of steps . But the overall impression is one of complacency on the part of the production team . They knew that the film was likely to make a mint , so were not too concerned with minor details such as a script . ' Help ! ' only comes to life when The Beatles perform ; the ' Ticket To Ride ' sequence in the Austrian Alps is stunning ( love the notes on the telegraph lines ) , as is the ' Another Girl ' section in the Bahamas . My favourite , though , is ' You've Got To Hide Your Love Away ' . Marvellous photography throughout . Its no wonder that Lester later became regarded as the ' father ' of M . T . V . An underrated aspect of ' Help ! ' is the incidental music . Ken Thorne caught the Bond-like atmosphere to a tee , and even includes a clever homage to Monty Norman's ' James Bond Theme ' at one point . ' Help ! ' is a relic from the time when The Beatles were conquering the world . Its worth watching for the music , but it could and should have been so much better .
401396	7743887	118688	8.0	What is wrong with ' camp ' ?	One thing that strikes me from reading these reviews is that people have sadly forgotten how to appreciate ' camp ' . Back in the ' 60's , camp was in vogue , thanks to the ' Batman ' television series , as well as movies such as ' Our Man Flint / In Like Flint ' and Dean Martin's ' Matt Helm ' series ( which began with ' The Silencers ' ) . What is camp ? It is a ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness on the part of the main characters , so serious in fact that it becomes amusing . So , yes , ' Batman & Robin ' is campy . And that's how I like the Caped Crusader . Taken seriously , I find him a bit of a bore . So many modern movies are ' dark ' now that I have to take a flashlight every time I visit the local multiplex . ' B & R ' was the third sequel to the 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster , which starred Michael Keaton . Both left the series at the same time . Their replacements were Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer . Schumacher retained the dark , brooding atmosphere of the Burton films , while bringing in some of the colourful campery of the ' 60's series . He was ripped to pieces for doing so but I think he was right . Kilmer was an adequate replacement . George Clooney donned the cowl and cape for ' B & R ' , and was better than Kilmer , but Keaton was still far and away the best . Warner Bros . ' ' Batman ' franchise was bound to run out of puff , and did . All franchises run out of puff in the end . James Bond did with ' The Man With The Golden Gun ' in 1974 . The less said about ' Superman 4 : The Quest For Peace ' the better . But they both recovered . Ditto ' Batman ' . ' Batman Begins ' could never have been made were it not for ' B & R ' . The plot concerns ' Mr . Freeze ' who is trying to save his dying wife by freezing Gotham City . . . something like that . It is not important . People who go to ' Batman ' in search of great plots are fools . Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast as ' Mr . Freeze ' - the man cannot , and never could , act . Patrick Stewart should have gotten the role . Then there's Uma Thurman as ' Poison Ivy ' , a villain I'm not familiar with , but she was the best thing in the movie . Sexy , sassy and cool . This was how she should have been in ' The Avengers ' . Alicia Silverstone as ' Batgirl ' ? Another mistake . ' Batgirl ' is to ' Batman ' what ' Scrappy Doo ' is to ' Scooby Doo ' . Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as ' Robin ' , but like ' Batgirl ' , I never could stand the character . As soon as the title of this film was announced , I thought : " Oh oh trouble ! " . Its so crass . ' Batman Supreme ' would have been better . So with all these strikes against it , why is ' B & R ' so much fun ? Simple . For those of us who fondly remember the ' 60's version , it works perfectly as a homage . If you ask me , they should have gone further by putting ' Pow ! ' , ' Zap ! ' and ' Kerpow ! ' on the fights . Nothing in the movie makes sense , nor is it meant to . Just as reality makes no sense . Don't go to ' B & R ' expecting Fellini , and you'll have a great time . The opening chase alone is worth purchasing the D . V . D . for . To all the doom mongers , I say this - lighten up ! Watch ' B & R ' and enjoy . We can get ' dark ' and ' edgy ' movies anywhere . ' Batman ' is not ' Seven ' !
401466	7743887	86006	8.0	Move Over Moore ! The Other Feller's Back !	As the ' 70's drew to a close , rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - James Bond . Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the making of ' Moonraker ' by the B . B . C . ' s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect . Understandably , the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion . When ' Moonraker ' opened , Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character , and the jumping onto the ' Star Wars ' bandwagon much as ' Live & Let Die ' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier . Many publicly vocalised their hope that Connery would return , if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look . Years of legal battles followed . The original script , entitled ' James Bond Of The Secret Service ' ( later retitled ' Warhead ' ) was written by Kevin McClory , Len Deighton , and Connery , was never filmed , and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters . A new script , closer to the ' Thunderball ' storyline , was commissioned . It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior , best known as the man who put the camp into ' Batman ' . He had also written ' The Parallax View ' , one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers . Feeling the script needed a British touch , Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais , writers of hit British sitcoms ' The Likely Lads ' and ' Porridge ' . The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline . ' Never Say Never Again ' opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise ; normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at Connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the film . Many used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series , particularly that year's ' Octopussy ' . In truth , ' Octopussy ' is superior in every respect . ' Never ' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with Bond , at times it looks like a made-for-T . V . movie . The story had been done before and better in 1965's ' Thunderball ' , hence ' Never ' was always going to come off second best . It was also hampered by not being part of the official series , meaning that Monty Norman's ' James Bond Theme ' and Maurice Binder's gun-barrel logo could not be used . As Bond , Connery is magnificent , effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role . Playing Bond as an older , wiser agent worked . Barbara Carrera landed her best movie role as villainous ' Fatima Blush ' , a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing Bond . Kim Basinger smolders as ' Domino ' . As S . P . E . C . T . R . E . agent ' Maximillian Largo ' , Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance . A major disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as ' Blofeld ' . The posters gave the impression he would be a major character , in fact he appears only in a few scenes . With a stronger script , he could have been one of the all-time great Bond villains . ' Never ' promised to be a throwback to the early Eon Bonds such as ' From Russia With Love ' , but did not deliver . The gadgets were there , but were used almost apologetically . Bond's rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the ' 60's . The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humour . Bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in ' Moonraker ' . But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as bumbling Foreign Office official ' Nigel Small-Fawcett ' . He gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue . Michel Legrand's music is horrible , the man seems to never to have seen a Bond film in his life . Though the film was a financial success , viewed years later it stands as the weakest Bond of the ' 80's . Connery himself was disappointed with it , and not did act in a movie again for some years . 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs , in addition to the Connery and Moore movies , George Lazenby did a delightful cameo in the made-for-T . V . ' Return Of The Man From U . N . C . L . E . : The Fifteen Years Later Affair ' .
401180	7743887	116118	8.0	" Its Time To Return . . . "	Since the triumphant return of ' Dr . Who ' to our screens in 2005 , fans have downgraded the 1996 T . V . movie from a ' disappointment ' to a ' disaster ' . Certainly it didn't lead to the expected follow-up series , but that was down to bad scheduling in the U . S . A . rather than the quality of the film itself . Over here it got nine million viewers ( an excellent rating for B . B . C . - 1 ) . The film's biggest mistake was to start with Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor . On landing in San Francisco in 1999 , he is shot by a drug gang and taken to a hospital where he dies - or seems to . In the mortuary , the ' corpse ' assumes a completely new form . Elsewhere , the Doctor's old enemy ' The Master ' has taken over the body of an ambulance driver , and plans to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations . Viewers who hadn't seen ' Dr . Who ' before were totally mystified . As McGann asserts his personality , the film becomes fun to watch . He's a terrific Doctor , and had the potential to be the best since Tom Baker , but it wasn't to be . Eric Roberts is a very different ' Master ' from the ones we're used to , but its a good thing . Daphne Ashbrook makes a delightful ' Dr . Grace Holloway ' , a character in the ' Liz Shaw ' mold . Yee Jee Tso's ' Chang Lee ' is great too . The interior of the TARDIS is a stunning piece of design , the S . F . X . are the best the show's ever seen ( faint praise though that is ) , and by and large the positives outweigh the negatives . But ' Dr . Who ' didn't impress the Americans , and back he went into limbo - until 2005 anyway .
401694	7743887	131158	8.0	" The best way to get people off the dole is to stop giving it to them ! "	One year after ' The Young Ones ' and ' The Comic Strip Presents ' launched a new wave of British comedians on an unsuspecting world , Granada T . V . brought out ' Alfresco ' . Despite starring Ben Elton , Stephen Fry , Hugh Laurie , Robbie Coltrane , Emma Thompson and Siobhan Redmond , it doesn't seemed to have burned itself into the national consciousness the way those other shows did , possibly because it felt more like a Channel 4 show than an I . T . V . one , and the obvious canned laughter killed many of the sketches stone dead . Beginning each week with a cheeky saxophone arrangement of ' I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles ' , ' Alfresco ' wandered widely between the borders of the inspired and the inane . Among the former was a spoof U . S . variety show , hosted by the giggly , vacuous singer ' Sherri ' ( Thompson ) who announces a tribute to The Beatles and manages to forget the drummer's name ( Ringo ) , Fry's pompous doctor unable to grasp why his Sikh patient is wearing a turban ( he thinks its bandages ) , and Thompson's fussy librarian revealing to bookworm Laurie the twist endings of the mysteries he intends to read . ' The Pretend Pub ' was a spoof soap peopled by oddballs with names like Ezzer , Bezzer , Lord Stezzer , Shizzer and so on . The off the wall humour Fry and Laurie later used in their own show was first in evidence here . Emma Thompson made the most impact on yours truly , mainly because she was stunningly beautiful . I can remember not finding Elton very funny though , sketch comedy was not really his forte , and he was overshadowed by the others . He would later find his niche with ' Saturday Live ' and ' The Man From Auntie ' . Critics at the time gave the show a pasting , one even renamed it ' Al-fiasco ' . It also came under fire from alternative comic Alexei Sayle . " Posh people can have anything they want . " , he said , " Even their own satirical show on Granada Television . " . Well , compared to the vile mess that was ' O . T . T . ' in which Sayle was a regular , ' Alfresco ' was ' Monty Python ' standard . Given that many of its cast went onto become major stars ( and Oscar winners in Thompson's case ) , its surprising how ' Alfresco ' has so far eluded a D . V . D . release .

In a meeting , he inadvertently insults his boss Cyril ( John Barron ) , not realising the comment has been captured on tape . When a colleague tells him this , he is horrified . Fearful that he may lose his job , he breaks into the office at night to steal the offending tape , but mistakenly steals the wrong one . . . ' Shelley ' was never at its best when the main character was seen working . The scenes at the advertising agency are mildly funny at best . It is only when Shelley goes back to Pangloss Road does any real humour appear . One of Shelley's workmates is played by David Warwick , who appeared in the first season of ' The Fall & Rise Of Reginald Perrin ' as Reggie's actor son , Mark . Also from that series is good old John ' C . J . ' Barron , reprising the role of ' Cyril ' . Funniest Moment - Shelley being woken at 3 a . m . by Fran and Mrs . H returning home drunk from the disco , singing Boney M's ' Brown Girl In The Ring ' . That song drove me up the wall too so I can well understand why he feels miffed !
401340	7743887	756706	8.0	Flawed Yet Fascinating	This was basically three programmes in one ; a ' Goodies ' reunion special ( wasn't it great to see Bill , Tim and Graeme in their old office again ? ) , a documentary tracing the history of ' The Goodies ' television series , and an ' I Love The ' 70's ' style nostalgia fest . The first two were fine , but the third was a waste of time . Who cares what Emma Kennedy thinks ? With most of ' The Goodies ' currently unavailable on D . V . D . , this provided a golden opportunity to see clips from as yet unreleased episodes such as ' Goodies Rule O . K . ' . Its easy to forget just how big ' The Goodies ' were back in the ' 70's . I've still got the books and records . Nice that Jim Franklin finally got some credit for his part in the ' Goodies ' success story . Welcome though this was , I can't help wondering why it didn't lead to a comprehensive rerun of the series ( aside from the ' Winter Olympics ' episode , shown on B . B . C . - 2 in January ) . It seems odd that B . B . C . - 2 can make this , yet won't repeat the series itself . They're a bunch of teapots !
401670	7743887	956732	8.0	" I Was Wellington's Boot ! "	Arriving at ' The Dolls ' House ' boutique , Duffy is horrified to see the supposedly gay Mr . Winters flirting with Sharon , as well as chasing her round the shop . Winters is only joking , but Eric feels genuinely insulted . Over a burger and chips at a café , they have a row , and he storms off . Sharon then gets friendly with a poor student named Chris , who has used the row as cover to steal chips from Sharon's plate . Chris takes Sharon to a museum and then to a stately home . They hit it off rather well . Chris is the complete opposite of Duffy , being intelligent and articulate . During walks in the park , he reads poetry to her . But Sharon makes a horrifying discovery : as part of his laboratory experiments Chris uses live rabbits . End of relationship . After a shaky first episode , ' Gang ' was really hitting its stride with some well-crafted story lines , including this one by Tony Bilbow . Its Sharon's show , with some nice if irrelevant contributions from Frankie and Craven . Sharon's date with Chris boasts some splendid location filming , although the choice of music is a bit unimaginative . Sharon's good-time girl of a mother is back , this time played by Barbara Keogh ( Diana Coupland was the original ' Connie Eversleigh ' ) . The character last appeared in the ' Please Sir ! ' episode ' The Decent Thing ' . Andria Lawrence is ' Sandra ' ( Sharon's new work colleague ) . Blonde , busty Ms . Lawrence seems to have been in every sitcom ever made in the ' 70's , most notably ' Doctor At Large ' and ' Doctor In Charge ' as the man-mad ' Nurse Willett ' . No mention is made of the fate of her predecessor , Yvonne Parker ( Carmen Munroe ) . Funniest moment - Frankie disguised as an old bearded man , a ruse so transparent I could see right to the back of my television screen !
400848	7743887	956728	8.0	" I'm a decorator ! "	Having been sacked by the G . P . O . , Peter Craven is working alongside Duffy and Batch as an interior decorator . Their first job is to paint a block of flats , owned by Mr . Stringer , a man so miserable as to give Rigsby from ' Rising Damp ' a run for his money . Meanwhile , Dennis has left home , and when he cannot find accommodation Duffy suggests he spend a night in one of Stringer's unoccupied flats . That night , Stringer shows up with a pretty girl in tow , and finds Dennis there in his pyjamas . . . Okay episode , notable mainly for the appearance of the late Dudley Foster as ' Mr . Stringer ' . This talented actor ( who sadly committed suicide in 1973 ) appeared in numerous films and television series of the 60's / early ' 70's . ' Steptoe & Son ' fans will remember him as the detective in the episode ' Robbery With Violence ' . His wife is played by Fanny Carby , another sitcom regular , mostly cast as nosey housewives . Funniest moment - a pyjama-clad Dennis attempting to justify his presence in the flat to Mr . Stringer . Pretending to be a decorator , he grabs a paint brush and makes a horrendous red daub on the door .

Written in the form of diary extracts , it told of the events leading up to the first transmitted episode - how Inspector Cyril Blake retired from the Luxton bus company after years of loyal service and moved to Spain with his sister Dorothy ( " Who's driving this plane ? Stan Butler ? " ) . We knew Blakey had a sister because in the ' On The Buses ' episode ' Going Steady ' he shows Stan a photo . Stephen Lewis put on drag to play Dorothy , but for ' Don't Drink The Water ' , it was ( rightly ) decided to hire an actress to play the role . The wonderful , much-missed Pat Coombs was then appearing regularly as a foil for Dick Emery . Lewis and Coombs made a formidable comedy team , much as Lewis and Varney had been . Rather like ' Duty Free ' nearly a decade later , ' Water ' was shot entirely in the studio , with travelogue footage spliced in . It made no difference . Audiences did not demand authenticity in their comedy in those days . It did well enough to secure a second season , but the ghost of ' On The Buses ' proved hard to exorcise . Rather like ' Going Straight ' , ' The Fenn Street Gang ' and most recently , ' The Green , Green Grass ' , ' Water ' was deemed inferior to the original , its merits ignored . It was an uphill struggle for Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney to recapture the success of ' Buses ' . Eventually , they gave up and moved on to , surprisingly , another spin-off - the awful ' Yus , My Dear ' starring Arthur Mullard . The first episode of ' Water ' has been made available as an extra on the ' On The Buses ' season 7 D . V . D . and makes enjoyable viewing , if you like ' fish out of water ' comedies . Interestingly , six years later , ' Reggie Perrin ' creator David Nobbs wrote a similar series for the B . B . C . - the appalling ' Sun Trap ' - which despite being shot in Spain , was far less amusing than ' Water ' .
401418	7743887	63534	8.0	" I Saw This Movie Once . . . "	Surely this was one of Mike Myers ' favourite movies from his childhood ? ' Salt & Pepper ' was produced by its stars Sammy Davis Jr . and Peter Lawford . ' Charles Salt ' and ' Christopher Pepper ' are owners of a seedy Soho nightclub who get into trouble when a beautiful Chinese agent dies in Salt's dressing room . Then , one by one , V . I . P . ' s start dropping like flies . Despite continual interference from the law , Salt and Pepper manage to uncover a diabolical plot by extremists to take over the country using a stolen nuclear submarine , H . M . S . Hercules . Its like watching a ' Matt Helm ' picture without Dino . The opening scenes are atrocious , but as soon as Salt and Pepper are kidnapped by fake policeman , it perks up . Some of the action is surprisingly violent for a lightweight comedy , particularly the finale in a military academy in which an M . P . dies when Pepper removes the pin from one of the grenades hanging from his belt . The excellent British cast are a big help - Michael Bates as the incompetent ' Inspector Crabbe ' , Ernest Clark as ' Colonel Balsam ' , and John LeMesurier as the eye patch-wearing villain ' Colonel Woodstock ' . Johnny Dankworth's swinging music catches the mood of the film perfectly . Michael Pertwee went on to write for ' The Persuaders ! ' starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore . Financially successful though the film was , it didn't lead to Sammy and Peter becoming ' the new Hope & Crosby ' . A sequel , ' One More Time ' ( directed by Jerry Lewis ) was an unmitigated disaster . Richard Donner went on to make ' The Omen ' , ' Superman ' and ' Lethal Weapon ' .
401357	7743887	590990	8.0	The Goodies In The Club	The Minister For Trade & Domestic Affairs wants the Goodies to recover compromising photos of her taken at the Playgirl Club . Tim goes undercover in drag . The Club is a veritable den of iniquity , with strip shows , saunas , massage rooms and displays of openly uninhibited behaviour . When Tim fails to report back , Graeme and Bill decide to rescue him . But the only way to get in is to pose as ' male bunnies ' a . k . a . ' Wolves ' . . . This satire on the so-called Permissive Society was made before the B . B . C . came to see ' The Goodies ' as a children's show . Its also one of the best episodes of Season 1 , despite boasting little by way of visual humour . A pre-'Are You Being Served ? ' Mollie Sugden plays the talkative Minister , with ' Carry On ' blonde bombshell Liz Fraser as the club's Mae West-style proprietor . Queenie Watts would later play Arthur Mullard's wife ' Lil ' in I . T . V . ' s ' Romany Jones ' and ' Yus My Dear ' . Tim gets to use his ' Lady Constance ' voice from ' I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again ' . Yes , the scenes in the Playgirl Club are sexist ( there's some nudity on display ) , and this has led to the episode being branded ' politically incorrect ' . U . K . Gold included it in a season of programmes called ' The Dog House ' . I can't help thinking that if it had been written by a woman though , it would today be regarded as a monument to female liberation . Funniest moment - Bill and Graeme attempting to identify the club's owner by the colour of her underwear ! Yes , that scene !
401105	7743887	617039	8.0	Death In Paradise	My copy of this episode lists the title as ' One On An Island ' . Where the desert came from I have no idea . Possibly it was used on different prints . It was based on a story by Donald E . Westlake , who as ' Richard Stark ' wrote the classic crime novel ' Point Blank ' and its numerous sequels . Brandon De Wilde is ' Alec Worthing ' , a banker who uses his inheritance to buy a boat , which he names ' The Victoria ' , in honour of his dead mother . He intends travelling the world . During a gale , the boat is wrecked , marooning him on a tropical island , whose only other inhabitants appear to be goats . With no hope of rescue , Alec grows used to his new home , but experiences agonising loneliness . One day , he sees a beautiful girl stepping out of the sea . She is called Vicki , the sole survivor of a ship wreck . Alec and Vicki become lovers . But a serpent enters this Eden in the shape of ' Joe ' , a pilot washed ashore in a dinghy . Alec worries that Vicki will be attracted to him . Keeping her out of sight , he murders the interloper and conceals the body . . . Like ' Eve ' , this is also about a loser who seeks refuge in a fantasy world . When it transpires that Vicki has the same name as Alec's late mother , I thought for one moment she was going to turn out to be a reincarnation , in which case an element of incest would have arisen , definitely unsuitable for 1969 television audiences . Thankfully that's not the case . Suzanna Leigh is the gorgeous ' Vicki ' ; among her other credits are the Bulldog Drummond adventure ' Deadlier than The Male ' from 1966 . David Bauer , cast as ' Uncle George ' , cropped up an awful lot in I . T . C . shows such as ' The Saint ' and ' The Prisoner ' . I have no idea where it was filmed , but it looks like they used a real island , and wisely did not try to mock up the whole thing in a studio . De Wilde , best remembered for his role as ' Joey Starrett ' in ' Shane ' in 1953 , died in a road accident two years after this was made .
400634	7743887	641210	8.0	" I want to see me daughter ! "	Millionaire Chester Farson ( Gordon Gostelow ) dies from heart failure . Eldest son Gerald ( Terance Alexander ) keeps news of his death a secret , hiring Gray to impersonate the old man to avoid paying death duties to the Government . He neglects to tell sister Jane ( Justine Lord ) about the deception , instructing his servants to keep her away from the family home in case she unmasks the fake . Jane spots one of her father's priceless paintings - ' Property Of A Gentleman ' - up for auction in London , and denounces it as stolen property . She brings in McGill to investigate . Breaking into the Farson home , Mac finds Gray , a drunken Shakespearian actor , beginning to live the part . As the plot unravels , Mac is bribed to keep his mouth shut . But will he ? Wilfred Greatorex wrote this , although his name is missing from the credits . Presumably he was unhappy with the way it turned out . It is a decent enough story , based on an entirely believable premise . With Inheritance Tax having recently been made into a hot political issue by the Tories ( inspired by its scrapping in America by the thankfully-gone Bush administration ) , it is interesting to see that even in 1967 the rich considered the paying of ' death duties ' ( as it was then called ) to be grossly unfair . They firmly believe that the tax burden should be placed on those at the lower end of the social scale , and that the law should be toughened for those convicted of minor social security fraud . As ' George Malone ' ( Peter Kerrigan ) observed in Alan Bleasdale's ' The Black Stuff ' : " Stealing is only thought bad when you take a little from some , instead of a lot from many . " . The main weaknesses are the casting of Justine Lord and Gordon Gostelow . Lord's role looks as if it was written for Sylvia Syms . She is miscast as an English rose ( though looks stunning in some groovy ' 60's fashions ) . Gostelow , on the other hand , is delightfully eccentric as ' Gray ' ( he was dubbed for his brief role as ' Farson ' ) but there's a bit too much of him . The episode at times takes on a lunatic air reminiscent of ' The Avengers ' . Frank Gatliff as an ' auctioneer ' and Derek Francis ' ' doctor ' provide welcome support . However , this is not one of the series ' more successful episodes .
400790	7743887	563092	8.0	" I'll have a pint of Appleyard ! "	Professor Loftus gives Duncan and Mike a severed human arm to dissect . Mike finds the job impossible as the very thought of it makes him queasy ( I cannot say I blame him ) . Later , at the canteen , he is unable to look at the food ( unappetising it looks too ) much less eat it . Duncan takes him to the pub where they each imbibe three pints of strong Appleyard cider . Returning to St . Swithins legless , they interrupt men putting in a radiator , and make off with their tools . They then terrify a female patient who thinks they intend doing a ' Jack The Ripper ' on her . . . Anyone who has over-indulged in the joys of cider will know exactly what Duncan and Mike are going through here ; that awful feeling of the world spinning round and round like a carousel , an ache in the guts , and a total inability to do even the simplest task successfully . Peter Greene , who plays ' Young Doctor ' , would return in later seasons in the more familiar guise of ' The Chaplain ' while Joy Stewart , cast as ' The Physiotherapist ' , is better remembered by fans as ' Sister Fowles ' . Martin Miller a . k . a . ' Professor Pearson ' - whose lecture Duncan and Mike gatecrash - was ' The Watchmaker ' in the ' Its Your Funeral ' episode of ' The Prisoner ' . Funniest Moment - Loftus asking Upton how he would deal with a bleeding patient . Mike stands there , frozen . Loftus counts down backwards , then says : " Time's up ! The man's dead ! " . It was the nearest the series got to the famous ' you , what's the bleeding time ? ' gag .
400612	7743887	563133	8.0	" Pretty Polly Is Pregnant ! "	Duncan had had a one-night stand with a sexy physiotherapist some months ago whilst returning from Edinburgh . Now she is working at St . Swithins . The trouble is he did not tell her his real name , he called himself ' Dick Stuart-Clark'So now the girl - Eleanor Wilcox - addresses Duncan as ' Dick ' and vice versa , which proves confusing for the staff at St . Swithins . Duncan dare not tell her the truth as Eleanor and Kate are close friends . . . This episode has echoes of ' Honey Lamb ' from the first season of ' Doctor In Charge ' . Here the girl from Duncan's past is none other than Lynda Bellingham , sporting a blonde wig . This was years before she became famous as the mother in the ' Oxo ' adverts . It also reminded me of ' Never Give Your Real Name ' from the second season of ' Man About The House ' . Though billed as guest star , Percy Herbert gets to do surprisingly little , most of the time he leers at Eleanor . There's also a Welshman on the ward who sings all the time . The point of the character escapes me . At the end , Kate reveals that she knows about Duncan's one-night stand and is prepared to forgive him , mainly because she was having one herself at the same time with an Australian physiotherapist . Good for you , girl ! Funniest moment - Duncan and Dick are having a private chat in the canteen when Loftus sits at their table . Duncan asks shyly if he does not mind them moving so that they can continue their conversation . The Professor agrees , so Duncan and Dick move off . A few seconds later , however , Loftus picks up his dinner and follows them !
400949	7743887	1231139	9.0	" You silly bitch ! "	Peter is trying to teach Sheila to drive . She damages the car and he has to call the local garage . A pair of mechanics ( Alun Armstrong and Malcolm Storry ) turn up , take one look at the vehicle , and pronounce it as being not worthy of repair . When Peter calls at the garage days later to collect the car , he has to deal with Mr . Myers ( Richard Wilson ) who is completely unhelpful . Called away to deal with another problem , Myers leaves Peter to answer the phone - an irate customer venting his spleen . The car back on the road again , he resumes his wife's learning , but she is utterly hopeless and backs into an articulated lorry . When he gets out to deal with the angry driver ( the term ' road rage ' had not been coined then , but it existed believe you me ) , she drives off , forcing him to give chase on foot . . . The second episode of ' Breath ' will ring a bell with anyone who's been ripped off by garages ( I used to work in one ) , staffed by shysters who exploit their customers ' general ignorance of motor cars . The guy I was unlucky enough to have as my boss once overcharged a customer simply out of contempt for the make of car he was driving ! At the end , when Peter revisits the garage , Mr . Myers tries to flog him a new vehicle . Typical ! As ' Victor Meldrew ' of ' One Foot In The Grave ' , Richard Wilson would experience similar problems with mechanics . Interesting to compare this with another ' lost ' David Jason sitcom - ' The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs ' . Briggs only reacted to events , here Barnes was responsible for them . Funniest moment - cleaning the windscreen , Sheila complains of one impossible-to-shift speck of dirt . Peter points out it is the other side of the tax disc !
401380	7743887	55231	9.0	An Overlooked Gem !	' The Night We Got The Bird ' turned up on Channel 4 one afternoon a few years ago . Never having seen it before , I tuned in . It was hysterical ! Brian Rix plays a nervous young man who marries Dora Bryan , formerly engaged to a disreputable antiques dealer played by Ronald Shiner , who'd died after being chased by the gangsters to whom he owed money . Brian and Dora's wedding night is disrupted by the presence of a caged bird which , little do they know , is the reincarnation of Shiner ! This bizarre story was partly scripted by legendary farce specialist Ray Cooney , and as you'd expect contains plenty of good lines and amusing situations . I burst out laughing when Irene Handl purchased a toilet seat made to look like a valuable antique mirror . The supporting cast are great too , amongst them Leo Franklyn , Liz Fraser , and of course the magnificent Irene Handl . Why this film isn't better known is a mystery . The same production team also made the army comedy ' The Night We Dropped A Clanger ' , with Rix playing dual roles .
401586	7743887	516857	9.0	Steed Does Some Spade Work !	Millionaire art collector Farrer ( Richard Hurndall ) informs his servant Zoltan ( John Hollis ) that men will soon will be coming to kill him . Handing over a priceless Oriental dagger , he tells him to take it to John Steed . Then he shuts himself in a glass coffin , his ' Last Will & Testament ' laid on his chest . Steed accepts the dagger not realising his life is in now great danger . It is none other than the legendary Falcon . Anyone who comes into possession of it dies . Fortune-hunters begin killing one another , each determined to have the Falcon . It is sought after because it contains the key to the whereabouts of the world's biggest black pearl . Steed and Tara must stay alive long enough to find out where it is . . . A homage to Dashiell Hammett's ' The Maltese Falcon ' which neatly manages to borrow its plot . The character played by the late Stratford Johhs is obviously based on Sidney Greenstreet's ' Kasper Gutman ' from John Huston's classic 1941 movie , while the late Ronald Lacey does a neat impersonation of Peter Lorre's ' Joel Cairo ' from the same film . Other familiar faces on view include swarthy Tutte Lemkow ( remember him as the cossack who drank poison intended for ' Inspector Clouseau ' in ' A Shot In The Dark ' ? ) , sinister Peter Swanwick ( ' The Supervisor ' from ' The Prisoner ' series ) , Ferdy Mayne ( the vampire Count in Roman Polanski's ' Dance Of The Vampires ' ( 1967 ) , and Richard Hurndall ( the gay antique dealer in the ' Steptoe & Son ' episode ' Any Old Iron ? ) . It is as you would expect tremendous fun , with the cast seeming to have a whale of a time spoofing film noir clichés . Writer Terry Nation must have been a classic movie buff , another of his ' Avengers ' episodes was ' Noon Doomsday ' and it meted out similar treatment to ' High Noon ' .
400805	7743887	723763	9.0	Espionage In Space	' One Way To The Moon ' is one of my favourite ' Time Tunnel ' episodes , made just before the show got bogged down with historical battles and alien invasions . Its one of only two spy stories in the series , the other being ' Secret Weapon ' , and its a pity they did not do more in similar vein . The premise is this : enemy agent Beard has infiltrated a U . S . manned flight to Mars in the year 1978 . The Russians want to stop the Americans from reaching The Red ( how ironic ) Planet first . Doug and Tony materialise aboard the rocket seconds before lift-off . Their excess weight slows it down , making the mission impossible without emergency refuelling . So they head for the Moon . The crafty Beard denounces them as spies , and recommends dumping them out of an airlock . But after going outside to repair the damaged hull , the scientists remain aboard until the ship touches down . At Project Tic-Toc in 1968 , Beard watches his future self with amazement . His fellow enemy agent Dr . Brandon blows up one of the Time Tunnel's computers , breaking visual contact with Tony and Doug . When his treachery is uncovered , he begins shooting at guards and flees . Unable to leave the complex , he hides out in the Tunnel's coils , where he is found - and later murdered - by Beard . Beard has successfully preserved his cover but is no longer able to see the fate of his future self - blown up by a bomb he planted in the fuel dump . As the rocket lifts off without them , Doug and Tony are thrown back into the infinite corridors of time . . . Stock footage from George Pal's ' Destination Moon ' provides the space and Moon scenes ( watch the rocket change shape in mid-journey ! ) . Rather oddly , the fuel dump has gravity , but lacks oxygen . As the Time Tunnel whisks the scientists off to another adventure , it divests them of their spacesuits , leaving them on the lunar surface without air . Bad science aside , this is a tense , exciting episode , neatly combining international intrigue and science fiction ( the first Moon landing was a good three years off ) . James T . Callahan is impressive in the role of the duplicitous ' Beard ' . Neither Tony nor Doug inform General Kirk of Beard's base treachery , indeed the adventure is not referred to again . Its almost a pity Beard does not get to watch his own death - the look on his face would have been priceless !
401044	7743887	612778	9.0	When Thieves Collide !	Back in the U . S . A . , Mundy is approached at the airport by a sexy blonde who tells him that a man in a phone booth has a gun trained on him . She orders him to get on a plane bound for Geneva . He gives his would-be kidnappers the slip and reports back to Noah Bain . The S . I . A . chief has a new mission for him - to break into the safe of a man named Bjornsen and steal N . A . T . O . defence secrets before he can sell them to the highest bidder . In Geneva , Mundy meets the blonde again , and her boyfriend , George Palmer , also a thief . He is also planning on breaking into the same safe , but for a different reason - to steal a valuable necklace . . . Likable Bill Bixby guests here as ' Palmer ' , a fellow thief . The actor was best known at that time for the sitcom ' My Favourite Martian ' , and would go on to star in ' The Magician ' and ' The Incredible Hulk ' . The best moments feature Palmer and Mundy trying to out-con one another . At one point , Mundy even uses fake police to attempt to deport his rival ! There's no actual battleship here , only a model one in Bjornsen's villa , and this is where the valuables are . Favourite moment - Palmer and Mundy duking it out in a hotel room while the blonde ( never named , incidentally ) sits watching them , calmly eating an apple !
400911	7743887	68742	9.0	Before Daniel , There Was John !	The late James Mitchell is best remembered as the creator of ' Callan ' , a long-running television spy series that starred Edward Woodward . Not so well remembered is a quartet of novels he wrote featuring another spy - John Craig of ' Department K ' . These were ' The Man Who Sold Death ' , ' Die Rich Die Happy ' , ' The Money That Money Can't Buy ' and ' The Innocent Bystanders ' . The latter was filmed in 1972 , starring my fellow countryman , the late , great Stanley Baker . A scientist called Kaplan has escaped from a Siberian work-camp , and gone to ground in Turkey . Kaplan is close to perfecting a means of transforming arid desert into tropical rain-forests . U . S . Intelligence agency Group Three wants him but , fearing a security leak , cannot use its own men , so its head Blake ( Dana Andrews ) calls on Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) of Britain's ' Department K ' . Loomis sends for John Craig , a tough , hard-as-nails agent who suffered torture on his last mission and is now considered expendable . He uses Craig as a decoy , while two other agents , Royce ( Derren Nesbitt ) and Benson ( Sue Lloyd ) carry out the assignment . Craig's first inkling that something is badly wrong comes when he visits New York and finds that the gun he had been promised by Loomis has not been provided . At the apartment block where Kaplan's brother's lives , he is brutally attacked . Then Group Three pick up Craig and subject him to a mock torture session . Craig is so psychologically disturbed that he cracks even though he is experiencing no physical pain . A Group Three agent ( Cec Linder ) comes up with an interesting analogy : " You can take a knife and sharpen it and sharpen it until it will cut anything , including silk scarves . Then one day you drop it on a stone floor . The knife still cuts , but the silk scarves are safe . " . ' Innocent Bystanders ' begins rather like ' A Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovitch ' , but following a pitched gun battle moves to London . As Loomis and Blake stroll through the city , they exchange information , and this is intercut with shots of Craig and Benson firing at targets . This change in styles is rather disconcerting , but fun . Good editing by Alan Patillo , best known for his work on Gerry Anderson's television shows . As John Craig , Baker is reminiscent of another with that surname - Daniel . Like the most recent incarnation of 007 , Craig is good at his job , but not infallible . He was a karate black belt in the books but that is not mentioned here . The fights in this movie are Bond-like . I wish the producers had resisted the temptation to trendify Craig though . His white suits , long hair and ' Yosser Hughes'-style moustache would doubtless make this film a hilarious experience for modern audiences . Geraldine Chaplin is a surprising choice for the role of ' Miriam Loman ' , the American girl whom Craig kidnaps and takes with to Turkey . I say surprising because , how can I put this , she is rather . . . plain . The glamour is provided by Sue Lloyd as ' Benson ' . As ' Loomis ' , the late Donald Pleasence gives a chilling performance , even his request for gooseberry fool and custard sounds unnerving . Derren Nesbitt's ' Royce ' seems to have been modelled on ' Toby Meres ' from ' Callan ' . Like Meres , Royce is young , hot-headed , and keen to show his superiority over the older man Craig . Warren Mitchell plays another of his funny foreigners , an Australian barman named ' Omar ' , who habitually refers to Craig as ' pommy bastard ' . The director was Peter Collinson , responsible for the original ( and best ) version of ' The Italian Job ' . He keeps the whole thing moving nicely , sprinting from one exciting set-piece to another . This is not a Bond-style adventure as such ( no gadgets etc . ) , but John Keating's music at times evokes Bond . When Craig enters a bank vault , for example , you think that the title theme from ' Thunderball ' is about to intrude on the soundtrack . The song - ' What Makes The Man ? ' - is in the middle of the film , and would have worked had it not been ' sung ' by its lyricist , the late Norman ' Hurricane ' Smith , the world's worst vocalist . ' Innocent Bystanders ' is hard to come by , but for fans of Stanley Baker and ' 70's spy thrillers is worth seeking out . As are the James Mitchell books ( credited to James Munro ) . One wishes that they had also been filmed , with Baker again as ' Craig ' .
400967	7743887	617046	9.0	The Jerry Crown Affair !	London-based private detective Jerry Crown is handsome , intelligent , and a wow with the ladies . About the only thing he is not is rich . Joyce , his present girlfriend , works as secretary to a fabulously wealthy American widow by the name of Leona Gillings , a devout believer in the supernatural . Leona wishes to communicate with her late husband Howard , but is fearful of being taken for a ride by the numerous fakes and fraudsters purporting to be mediums . Jerry accompanies her to a séance , and exposes a carefully worked-out scam . Leona is impressed with his shrewdness , and soon the couple grow very close . But Jerry is a bit of a fraud himself , seeing Leona as his meal ticket . Even Joyce is disgusted by his deceit . Then Jerry meets his match in the shape of Miss Sarah Prinn , a genuine spiritualist . . . The name ' Robert Bloch ' has become ( for obvious reasons ) synonymous with that of his most famous novel ' Psycho ' . He also penned a number of original screenplays and television scripts ( including the ' Catspaw ' episode of ' Star Trek ' ) , of which this is one . It was directed by Roy Ward Baker , one of Hammer's best directors . Two years later , they worked together again on the Amicus multi-storey horror picture ' Asylum ' . Tom Adams , future star of ' The Enigma Files ' , plays Jerry Crown , a private eye bent on fleecing his rich client . Adams brings to the character the same laconic style he brought to the role of secret agent ' Charles Vine ' . I could have cheerfully watched him all day exposing fraudulent spiritualists . A series starring Adams as ' Jerry Crown ' would definitely have been welcomed by me . Of course , the conclusion of this story made such a notion impossible . Julie Harris , who plays ' Leona ' , was no stranger to tales of the supernatural , having appeared in Robert Wise's classic ' The Haunting ' in 1963 . Estelle Parsons , a . k . a . ' Miss Sarah Prinn ' , starred opposite Boris Karloff in Michael Reeves ' cult classic ' The Sorcerers ' two years earlier .
400978	7743887	71057	9.0	Eric Chappell's Forgotten Sitcom	" I hope ' The Squirrels ' never return . It drove me nuts ! " went a letter in ' The People ' newspaper in 1976 . I suppose it was inevitable that someone would make a crack like that , about a show with such a daft title . Writer / creator Eric Chappell described it as being about ' the paranoia and lust for promotion of white-collar workers in confined spaces . " . He based the show on his experiences as a travelling auditor with the East Midlands Electricity Board . It was his first sitcom hit , the pilot being screened just ahead of the first series of ' Rising Damp ' . Set in the accounts department of International Rentals , a television hire company , it focused on the lives of a motley group of characters ; ' Mr . Fletcher ' was the boss , splendidly played by Bernard Hepton ( his first T . V . role since ' Colditz ' ) as a bow-tied , bespectacled lecher , his underling was the nervous ' Rex ' ( the wonderful Ken Jones from ' Porridge ' ) , ' Harry ' ( Phil Silvers-lookalike Alan David ) was always on the make , and then there was ' Burke ' ( Ellis Jones from the children's sitcom ' Pardon My Genie ' ) who read Dracula comics when he was meant to be working . Being a ' 70's sitcom with an office setting , there just had to be a sexy secretary , and was - ' Carol ' ( Karin McCarthy ) , whom Fletcher was always lusting after . Rex was married to downtrodden but sympathetic Susan ( Patsy Rowlands - who was also in ' Bless This House ' when this was made ) . In one episode , Rex had to attend a company conference , which meant him spending time away from home . Susan dutifully packed his belongs , and then secretly followed him to ensure he got up to no naughty business . In another , Rex got so fed up that he resigned , before applying for a similar job . He later found that it was his old job he was applying for . In yet another , Rex meets an old friend and rival ( Philip Madoc ) whom has fallen on hard times and is forced to play ' The Sugar Balls Man ' for a breakfast cereal company . Wanting to get time off to watch cricket on television in another episode , Rex feigns illness , only to do the job too well - everyone back at the office thinks he has died . It was a standard sitcom , though good fun , boasting a good cast and some wonderful lines . When Harry complains about Rex's habit of having his hair cut on the firm's time , Rex responds : " Why not ? It grows on the firm's time ! " . The only annoying aspect was the obvious canned laughter - a problem that dogged all sitcoms made by A . T . V . After two seasons , Chappell relinquished the writing duties to others , such as future ' Grange Hill ' creator Phil Redmond , actor Kenneth Cope , and Alan Hackney . In 1991 , Yorkshire Television remade it as ' Fiddlers Three ' starring Peter Davison and Paula Wilcox , but it was nowhere near as good . Apart from the pilot , the show still exists , and may be seen by a new audience someday . I just hope no-one expects it to be anything like ' The Office ' . Why do I have the awful feeling that ' Fiddlers Three ' will see the light of D . V . D . first ?
401073	7743887	675776	9.0	What Did You Do In The War , Mr . Potter ?	Potter is a member of the local Old Comrades Association , where he bores everyone by blathering on about his war experiences . The only reason he gets selected to lead the forthcoming veterans ' parade is that no-one had the nerve to blackball him . Exactly how true Potter's experiences are will soon be put to the test as his old commanding officer at El Alamein - Bell - shows up at Fenn Street School , demanding to see him . The caretaker is terrified , and with good reason . Bell is the only man alive who knows that he panicked under fire and fled . . . A good Esmonde / Larbey episode , reminiscent of the ' Dad's Army ' story ' The Two And A Half Feathers ' ( in which Corporal Jones ' honour and integrity was under question ) . Luckily for Potter , Bell only wants a regimental photo , nothing else . Very little of 5C here ; they appear briefly in a short scene with Smithy but that's about it . Ffitchett-Brown leaves to take up teaching in Africa . He had not been in the show for very long , and no attempt whatever was made to develop his character or even replicate the relationship Hedges had with the original 5C . Apart from occasionally goosing Doris Ewell , he might as well not have been there . Joe Gladwin - ' Stan ' from ' Nearest & Dearest ' and future ' Last Of The Summer Wine ' cast member - is one of the veterans . Funniest moment - Potter proudly marching at the head of the veterans ' parade , before leading them down a cul-de-sac !
401168	7743887	641224	9.0	Caught in the web !	With space exploration becoming more and more commonplace , an international committee is set up to define legalities concerning the new territory . One such committee member is Dr . James Norbert ( Ray MacAnally ) , a brilliant American lawyer with a fondness for drink . However , a special interest group wants to delay the proposals by at least a decade , and to this end , blackmail Dr . Norbert with photos that show him , amongst other things , hitting a bartender , and in bed with a prostitute . Horrified that his daughter might see the pictures , he calls in McGill to find out who the blackmailers are . Mac travels to Manchester and begins searching for a bar that resembles the one shown in the photo . It turns out to be Gulliver's , run by sinister Joe Gulliver ( John Savident ) . McGill is warned to keep away from the place . On leaving , he is picked up by a limousine containing the urbane Simon Croft ( Simon Oates ) , who represents a consortium of financiers . He offers Mac a wad of money to keep his mouth shut . . . Written by Edmund Ward , this again has McGill caught in a crossfire of intrigue . If you thought the G20 summit a waste of time and money , what about the idea of a committee set up to determine laws for outer space ? Any excuse to have a junket these lawyers . The consortium's reason for wanting to delay the outcome is to give them time to get into a position whereby they can profit . You must remember that in 1966 the idea that bases could one day be put on the Moon or stations in orbit seemed not only possible but probable . It would make sense that someone would try and exploit the new territory , resorting to blackmail and physical violence . As ' Norbert ' , the late Ray McAnally gives his usual brilliant performance . Initially , the character refuses to comply with the blackmailers ' demands but , by the end , terrified of losing both his reputation and daughter's love , backs down . The last shot is of him gazing at a whisky bottle , the source of his troubles . Simon Oates , who plays ' Croft ' , starred in the sci-fi drama ' Doomwatch ' four years later . Ralph Michael , cast as ' Sir Giles ' , was ' The Dean ' in the sitcoms ' Doctor In The House ' and ' Doctor At Large ' . John Savident - nightclub owner ' Gulliver ' - is better known now as ' Fred Elliott ' in ' Coronation Street ' .
400776	7743887	563132	9.0	" Skate and I are going kating ! "	Duncan is suffering from depression and does not know why , so he goes to see psychiatrist Professor Browning , who advises him to change his lifestyle , to become more ' with it ' . He does so , and his friends are amazed at the change . MacKenzie and Stuart-Clark are so impressed they go to see the Professor themselves , resulting in major personality shifts . Andy loses his love of alcohol , while Dick not only stops drinking , gambling and womanizing , but develops a serious interest in medicine . Even Loftus is not immune from the professor's way of thinking . . . Very good episode , this , notable for the sight of the regulars acting out of character . Only Kate is unaffected . Stuart-Clark's studious new image is a foretaste of the persona he'd eventually adopt in ' Doctor At The Top ' . Funniest moment - Loftus showing up at Kate's dinner party in loud clothes , and acting in a unnaturally jocular manner : " Call me Geoffrey ! " .
400616	7743887	563131	9.0	The Tables Are Turned !	Duncan is in charge of a group of young male students , and plays the clown at every opportunity . He turns the operating theatre into a music hall with a constant barrage of jokes . But the smile vanishes from his face when he finds a gall bladder left over from what was supposed to be a tonsil operation . A terrified Duncan thinks his medical career may be over . In actual fact , he is the victim of a sick practical joke played on him by the students . Even Dick is not in on it . Several months before becoming a household name as teddy boy ' Jakey Smith ' in the I . T . V . sitcom ' Get Some In ! ' , Robert Lindsay made a guest appearance in this ' Doctor On The Go ' episode , as the mischievous Harrison . Even here his talent is unmistakable . Had Robin Nedwell refused to continue in the show , Lindsay would have made an ideal replacement . Gail Renard's script has a ' Doctor In The House ' feel , what with the trouble-making students and jolly japes . Without realising it , poor Duncan has become a ' Loftus ' figure to these fresh-faced youngsters . At the start of the episode , Duncan tells the students of the time he got Bingham drunk and put his leg in plaster . Fans will recognise the anecdote as being the plot of the classic ' Doctor In Charge ' story ' Honeymoon Special ' . Of course Duncan soon realises what is going on and manages to turn the tables on the students . Funniest moment - Dick posing as a patient needing a cyst operation . When the students examine his leg , it turns out to be false !
400788	7743887	563035	9.0	" There's a banana sticking out of your pocket ! "	The Purser finds a pair of trousers on deck . Inside is written the name ' Manuel Sanchez ' . Checking the passenger list , he finds no-one of that name is officially aboard , hence the M . S . Begonia has acquired a stowaway . As a hunt gets underway , Dick goes back to his cabin . Manuel is hiding in the wardrobe . The Spaniard went to England to work but started pining for his fiancée . Lacking the funds to go home to Tenerife , he hid himself away on the ship . Stuart-Clark took pity on him and has been stealing food . Duncan finds him too , and also begins stealing food . When the doctors realise what the other is up to , they pool their resources in order to get Manuel safely off the ship . . . David Jason plays ' Manuel ' . He had earlier appeared in the ' In The House ' episode ' What Seems To Be The Trouble ? ' as ' Mr . Drobnic ' , and in the ' At Large ' instalment ' Let's Start At The Beginning ' as the behaviourally challenged ' Victor Bligh ' ( we must not overlook his memorable contribution to that same season's ' Congratulations ! Its A Toad ! ' - he voiced the toad ! ) . He gives a wonderful performance as ' Manuel ' . Forget the comic accent , just check out his body language . Humphrey Barclay liked Jason so much he gave him his own series that year - the unfairly forgotten spy spoof ' The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs ' . It does seem a little odd though for Stuart-Clark to be openly aiding a stowaway with no profit whatever to himself . Perhaps its the first sign of change in his character ( which would be completed by the time of ' Doctor At The Top ' ) . Funniest moment - Manuel repeatedly coming out of a wardrobe to make food requests to Duncan . Top marks for Bob Todd too for being such a good sport by doing the swimming pool gag .
400902	7743887	563009	9.0	Night Of The Croaking Terror !	Paul brings a sack of toads to Dr . Maxwell's surgery , intending to use them in pregnancy tests . But these all prove wildly inaccurate , mainly due to his ' toads ' being frogs , and male ones at that ! Soon the creatures are hopping all over the place , turning up in the bath , and laying frog spawn in saucepans and ice buckets . A visit from Dr . Mackendrick proves problematic - the ice in his whisky contains a tadpole . But how to get it out before he can swallow it ? It's fair to assume that David Jason doesn't regard this as a career highpoint . His contribution consists of ' yippit ! ' . Fulton Mackay was two years away from becoming ' Mr . Mackay ' in that timeless classic ' Porridge ' . Kate Williams would later play ' Joan Booth ' in ' Love Thy Neighbour ' . The funniest moment here however belongs to Arthur Lowe , as he attempts to get the ice from Mackendrick's glass without him noticing . If you don't laugh at this , you've no sense of humour .
401604	7743887	563068	9.0	A Fete Worse Than Death !	Loftus asks Duncan , Paul , Dick and Bingham to come up with ideas for the 1973 St . Swithins Annual Garden Fete . Duncan wants a beauty contest , Paul wishes to do conjuring tricks ( as ' The Great Collieto ' ) , Dick ( rather bizarrely ) suggests a puppet show , and Bingham's big idea is . . . donkey rides . Duncan is horrified when he learns his current girlfriend Annabel is to be one of the beauty contest contestants . Paul's expertise at magic rivals that of Tommy Cooper . Bingham's donkeys turn up four days early ( which means he has to hide them in one of the lecture theatres ) , while Dick's puppet show turns out to be a sneaky ploy to sell beer . . . Almost every sitcom at one time or another has featured a plot about a garden fête , from ' Terry & June ' to ' Father Ted ' . This Phil Redmond scripted episode , though playing on familiar turf , manages to be good fun . Though referred to ( she's one of the contestants ) , Helen Fraser's ' Mary Bingham ' is not in this episode . The oft-mentioned ' Nurse Doreen Willett ' is again played by Andrea Lawrence ( last seen in the ' Doctor At Large ' episode ' Pull The Other One ' ) . Funniest moment - Loftus attacked by Mr . Punch !
401453	7743887	204773	10.0	" Hullo ! Siadwel here ! "	' A Kick Up The Eighties ' and ' Laugh ? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee ! ' laid the groundwork for this classic sketch show which , despite spawning two spin-offs - ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' and ' The Baldy Man ' - strangely seems to have fallen off the radar . The early editions opened with Andy Gray and Helen Lederer reading spoof news items similar to those of ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' . Lederer herself wrote and performed monologues in which she played a tipsy bimbo . My favourite recurring character though was Siadwel , a geeky Welsh poet played to perfection by John Sparkes . In filthy anorak and N . H . S . spectacles , Siadwel regaled us with such stunning observations on life as : " Uncle Pob wouldn't put his dog in the kennels before going on holiday . He said it was cruel . So he drowned him . " . Sparkes eventually left to appear in Channel 4's ' Absolutely ' . Later programmes had Gregor Fisher as Gus , the boisterous newsreader of the Outer Hebrides Broadcasting Corporation ( O . H . B . C . ) . Some of the humour could be sick , such as the man accidentally decapitating commuters with a hedge trimmer . One particularly brilliant sketch featured the cast as ' The Broons ' , a comic-strip Scottish family well known to readers of ' The Sunday Post ' . Each show closed with Thatcher roaring like the M . G . M . lion . This was later changed to John Major issuing a mouse-like squeak ! Special mention should be made of David McNiven and his wonderful songs . ' Naked Video ' was , for my money , one of the best sketch shows the B . B . C . has ever made .
401456	7743887	59387	10.0	One Of The Best Spy Spoofs Of The ' 60's	Made on a budget which wouldn't have paid for one of 007's Vodka Martinis , this little-known British film is surprisingly good . Tom Adams , as agent Charles Vine , could have made a fine Bond ( one wonders if Vine effectively ruled him out as a candidate for the role ) as he projects more than the required level of machismo and charisma . The supporting cast , particularly Peter Bull as the scheming criminal ' Masterman ' , are impressive , while John Arnatt steals the show as Vine's boss Rockwell ; his explanation of events to Vine at the hospital is brilliantly delivered . The script's well-written , beginning with a teaser worthy of ' The Avengers ' , and climaxing with a multi-double cross shoot-out . Lindsay Shonteff pulls off some decent action scenes , using the city of London to good effect . If ' Licensed To Kill ' can be likened to any Bond film , its ' From Russia With Love ' , as once again agents of the East and West are played off against one another by a mysterious third party . Very underrated film .
400885	7743887	59362	10.0	" Skirt is meat ! "	As the ' 60's progressed , a sea change took place in British film comedy . Norman Wisdom and St . Trinians were suddenly out-of-date ( though they kept on going for a few more years ) , and a new wave of Britcoms appeared , among them ' The Knack ' . Richard Lester had just made ' A Hard Days ' Night ' and brought the same mindset to this picture . Coming a year before Time magazine published its famous ' Swinging London ' article , it depicts a Britain on the cusp of a cultural and ( more importantly ) sexual revolution . As Spike Millgan later put it : " Queen Victoria died in 1960 ! " . It is arty ( shot in glorious black and white ) , sexist , often irritating , yet manages in its own way to say something serious about human relationships . Michael Crawford stars as ' Colin ' , a shy , repressed schoolteacher brassed off because his boarder , the good-looking ' Tolen ' ( Ray Brooks ) has a knack for ' pulling the birds ' . Tolen is the Russell Brand of his day ; girls are literally queueing outside his room at all times for sex . Tolen offers Colin a masterclass in the art of seduction . Tolen's attitude to the fairer sex is : " I see , I want and I take " , the sort of chauvinistic attitude probably responsible for Women's Lib in the first place . But even his powers are about to be tested to the limit when along comes Nancy ( Rita Tushingham ) a Northern lass newly arrived in London in search of lodgings . Nancy is immune to Tolen's ' Mr . Tight Trousers ' persona , and when he tries to get fresh with her she cries ' Rape ! ' . A number of reviewers have described the movie as ' dated ' . They are absolutely right . But it is fascinating for that reason alone . It is now a quaint museum piece , the sexual attitudes and mores of the era are on view and are fascinating . It may surprise some to learn that the play on which the film is based was written by a woman - Ann Jellicoe . Lester took the play and opened it out ( with help from screenwriter Charles Wood ) , turning it into a visual delight . Surrealism had finally joined the comedy mainstream . The jokes come at you so fast you need to be quick to pick them up . For instance , when Colin wonders whether to let his front room to a monk , we suddenly cut to a bus full of monks . When he gets angry and tries to keep Tolen out of the house by boarding up the front door , the film turns into a mini-lecture on carpentry . Throughout a Greek chorus of elderly people comment on events . " I know what she's looking for and its not the Y . W . C . A . ! " . Their remarks are much the same as you would hear nowadays . Being too old for sex themselves , they frown on the younger generation for being able to do it . Its these quirky flourishes that gives the film much of its charm . The famous scene where Colin , Nancy and Tom push a bed through the streets of London employs a style that was later used on ' The Monkees ' and ' The Goodies ' . The cast are excellent , in particular Donal Donnelly as an eccentric Irishman with a mad compulsion to paint everything white . Michael Crawford's ' Colin ' has all the naivety of his later ( better known ) role of ' Frank Spencer ' . Tushingham's innocent waif is appealing . As ' Tolen ' , all quiff and dark glasses , Ray Brooks is the epitome of ' 60's cool , a man who has women falling for him like dominoes . Watching this again recently , it occurred to me what a great vehicle for Peter Cook and Dudley Moore this would have made . The humour is broadly in line with what the duo were doing on ' Not Only But Also ' . You can easily imagine Cook as ' Tolen ' and Moore as ' Colin ' . Perhaps these characters inspired the ones they later played in ' Bedazzled ' . The film has its share of longueurs , however . Colin pretending to be a lion is something I think it could have done without . And Nancy's cries of ' Rape ! ' to passers-by have ensured it a high place on the ' it has not aged well ' movie lists . ' Comedy has a new freedom ' gushed Newsweek magazine at the time of its release . Absolutely . Rather than being brushed under the carpet , sex was now openly talked about on screen . There was to be no going back . Nudity and bad language would soon enter the equation . I must mention John Barry's marvellous score . He was on the top of his game here ( having just done ' Goldfinger ' and ' Zulu ' ) and the music perfectly accompanies the offbeat action . You will be humming that gorgeous title theme for days . If you want a British movie that has ' Sixties ' written all over it , look no further . It also manages to be a life-affirming , witty and accomplished piece of work .
401613	7743887	640784	10.0	" He went thataway ! "	Sloane and Torque are at a power station in Germany , investigating a tip-off about a possible sabotage attempt . All appears normal , until an engineer acts strangely after hearing a sequence of musical notes on his computer pen . He pushes the controls well beyond the ' safety ' level , and explosions start to go off . With Torque's help , Sloane saves the man's life . Power-crazed cosmetics manufacturer Edward Danton is using glamorous models to lure U . S . Generals into compromising situations - then brainwashing them into disclosing the launching codes of America's nuclear arsenal . Danton intends causing Armaggeddon by means of a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the East . Exciting second episode this , with the novelty casting of ' I Spy ' star Culp as an eccentric dog-loving villain . Sloane has a handy laser in his cigarette lighter . He gets away from the bad guys in one scene by hanging onto the skids of a helicopter , something we'll see him do again later in the series . Sexy Sybil Danning seen briefly .
401207	7743887	108891	10.0	" Come Along , Miriam ! Chop ! Chop ! "	I've never been fond of cricket , so I was tempted to give ' Outside Edge ' a miss . I only watched because of the presence of Timothy Spaull ( of ' Auf Pet ' fame ) and the scrumptious Josie Lawrence . I'm glad I tuned in because if I hadn't I'd have missed I . T . V . ' s last truly great sitcom , a delightful show centred around two cricket-mad men , Roger Dervish and Kevin Costello , and their contrasting wives , the prim and proper Miriam and larger-than-life Maggie . Shot on film , and without a studio audience to ruin the best lines , ' Outside Edge ' was satisfying on all levels . It didn't bend over backwards to be funny . The regular cast were perfect , in particular Robert Daws , whose ' Roger ' must rival ' Gordon Brittas ' as the sitcom character you'd most like to throttle . The show had its tragic moments too ; witness Maggie's sad pleas for pregnancy in the Corfu Xmas special . With more and more modern sitcoms relying on toilet humour for comic effect , it seems unlikely that we will get many more series of this ilk . More's the pity .
401379	7743887	68148	10.0	Kids Today Like To Have Their Own Way	Memories of this charming show were rekindled recently when I bought a video tape from a charity shop . Only five episodes were on it , but they were enough to make me realise that the overpraised ' The Simpsons ' was not the first series about an animated dysfunctional family . What I found refreshing is that the show is firmly on the side of Harry Boyle as he encounters - and is mystified by - modern youth culture . A similar show now would encourage the audience to laugh at Harry for being behind the times . The Boyle's next-door neighbour , Ralph , is a right-wing cretin who sees Communist conspiracies lurking under his refrigerator ( the inspiration for ' Jimmy ' in ' The Fall & Rise Of Reginald Perrin ' , perhaps ? ) . Though a cartoon , the show lacks the conventions of the genre such as chases , comic sound effects ( okay , there are a few but they're not very noticeable ) and frenetic music . In fact , ' Wait ' is better written than many live-action comedy shows . If you get the chance to check it out , do so .
401626	7743887	72500	10.0	" Papers Arrived Yet , Fawlty ? "	I missed the first three ' Fawlty Towers ' episodes on its original run ( I was hooked on the I . T . V . series ' Beryl's Lot ' ) so my first encounter with Basil was the fourth episode ' The Hotel Inspectors ' . Even now I can feel the pain in my side from laughing too hard . I spent the next few days telling everyone how great this show was . The real Basil Fawlty was the late Donald Sinclair , owner of ' The Gleneagles ' in Torquay . He was so rude that the Python cast , there on a location shoot , moved out ! Cleese remembered him when writing for the L . W . T . sitcom ' Doctor At Large ' . The episode ' No Ill Feeling ! ' is absolutely hilarious and it was clear that there was a series based around its setting and characters . ' Fawlty ' was not an immediate hit , possibly because many wrongly assumed it was going to be another ' Python ' . Fortunately , repeats came to the rescue . When the second series started in 1979 , it was eagerly awaited by the country . It goes without saying that ' Fawlty Towers ' is the most perfectly realised British sitcom of all time ; what other series could feature a patently unconvincing rat and still work ? It hasn't diminished with the passage of time either . Brilliant performances from the entire cast , great scripts from John Cleese and Connie Booth , and first-class direction by John Howard Davies and Bob Spiers . If only there'd been more episodes !
401367	7743887	54279	10.0	Quintessentially English !	Stephen Potter's witty books were unfilmable as they stood , so top marks to Hal E . Chester and Patricia Moyes for coming up with a workable script . ' School ' centres on one Henry Palfrey , one of life's failures , who enrols at The School Of Lifemanship in Yeovil to learn how to become a success . The scene where he gets his own back on the two shady car dealers who sold him a Swiftmobile ( Dennis Price and Peter Jones ) is marvellously satisfying . As Henry , Ian Carmichael is , as ever , simply sublime , and the rest of the cast ( Alistair Sim , Jeanette Scott , Irene Handl , John Le Mesurier ) are to die for . Best of all , Terry-Thomas appears in his finest movie role , as the caddish Ray Delauney . His mounting stress as Henry turns the tables is hysterical ! I can't think of a bad word to say about this film . Robert Hamer never managed to top ' Kind Hearts & Coronets ' but with this , he came tantalisingly close . Watch and marvel . If you don't like it , ' hard cheese ' !
401497	7743887	60955	10.0	" Another key unturned "	Welcome to the most chilling science fiction movie you will ever see . ' Seconds ' is based on a quite plausible premise , that somewhere out there is an underground organisation known as ' The Company ' , which specialises in giving people new identities , fresh starts in life . Arthur Hamilton , a middle-aged businessman , is approached by a Company employee whilst commuting , and gets offered the chance to begin his life again . Trapped in a loveless marriage , and with nothing to look forward to save retirement , he opts to be reborn . After extensive plastic surgery , he emerges butterfly-like as ' Antiochus ( Tony ) Wilson ' , professional artist . Wilson is given a lovely home near the sea , a live-in manservant , and strikes up an affair with a beautiful neighbour , Nora Marcus . But he realises too late that his new life is just as empty , as meaningless as the one he threw away . Returning to The Company , he asks to be given yet another identity . Unable or unwilling to nominate another candidate for rebirth , he unwittingly signs his own death warrant . . . ' Seconds ' was directed by the late John Frankenheimer , then at the peak of his powers as a film-maker , with classics such as ' Birdman Of Alcatraz ' , ' The Manchurian Candidate ' , and ' Seven Days In May ' to his credit . He brings a Hitchcockian feeling of suspense to the early scenes , while the post-rebirth section could not have been bettered by Kubrick . James Wong Howe's cinematography is breathtaking ; the ' Company ' scenes are chillingly stark , while the infamous wine festival is soft focus . Speaking of which , the scene is carefully edited so that even though people are running around naked you never see anything explicit . Imagine what it might have been like had the film been made five years later . For Rock Hudson , the film was a welcome change of direction after those romantic comedies with Doris Day . He gives a moody , powerful performance which surely must rank as his best . According to Danny Peary's book ' Cult Movies 3 ' , the party scene where Wilson breaks down and pleads for the right to his identity hit the actor so hard he could not stop crying . Hudson's homosexuality was at that time one of Hollywood's best-kept secrets . The excellent supporting cast includes Salome Jens , giving a hypnotic performance as the free-spirited Nora , Will Geer as the president of ' The Company ' , and Murray Hamilton as ' Charlie ' , who by nominating his old friend Arthur Hamilton as a candidate for rebirth inadvertently sets in motion the wheels of his destruction . The most impressive performance comes from the late John Randolph as ' Arthur ' . He is simply brilliant , particularly when he realises he has nothing to live for , and one wonders why he did not bag an Oscar for best supporting actor . Lewis John Carlino's script is a little talky , but its ideas ( derived from David Ely's novel ) are solid . Who is to say that a story like this could not happen in real life ? How do we know there isn't a ' Company ' out there right now ? The late Jerry Goldsmith surpasses himself with a magnificent score , as bleak and foreboding as the film itself . ' Seconds ' also has the most horrifying ending of any film I have ever seen . A guaranteed nightmare inducer . Not a picture for those who like their science fiction drenched in C . G . I . , ' Seconds ' ought to be compulsive viewing for young people who think plastic surgery is the key to a better life .
400694	7743887	70328	10.0	When Bond Became Saintly !	In the early ' 70's , it looked as though the Bond movie franchise was doomed . Connery had quit for good following ' Diamonds Are Forever ' , and the hunt was on for a new leading man . On top of that , the series was widely perceived to be outdated . Clint Eastwood's ' Dirty Harry ' had arrived . Bond had to move with the times - or die . Roger Moore , fresh from the T . V . series ' The Persuaders ! ' landed the role of 007 . At the time I was horrified . Moore was too well known as ' The Saint ' - though the series ended in 1969 , it was still being shown in reruns . Could he cope with the challenge of Bond ? I need not have worried . He made the part his own very quickly . He is surprisingly good as a harder-edged 007 . The smirking Bob Hope wannabe of later films had yet to appear . Based on Ian Fleming's second Bond novel , ' Live & Let Die ' takes Bond into the orbit of the mysterious ' Mr . Big ' , who is funding SMERSH operations with pirate treasure . Tom Mankiewicz threw out most of the plot , and brought in a drug angle more in keeping with the times . If ' Diamonds Are Forever ' was ' Goldfinger 2 ' , then ' Live & Let Die ' is ' Dr . No 2 ' . The Jamaican setting , the murder of one of Bond's colleagues , the naive heroine , a deadly insect used as a murder weapon , Bond being assisted by a black man named ' Quarrel ' , all had been done before , and yet , strangely , ' Live & Let Die ' feels fresh and exciting . It was decided early on to distance the film from its predecessors , hence no briefing in M's office , or gadget lecture from Q . Even the villain's grand master plan is not particularly extravagant . Instead of blowing up the world , he wants to flood the market with free drugs . As was the case with 2006's ' Casino Royale ' , you don't feel as though you are being served up reheated left-overs . Yaphet Kotto is a fine villain , as are Julius W . Harris and Geoffrey Holder . I am not nor ever have been a fan of Jane Seymour , and her bland performance as ' Solitare ' is the film's only weakness . Compared to the tired runaround that was ' Diamonds Are Forever ' , ' Live & Let Die ' is bigger and better in every department . Just compare the boring car chase in the former to the thrilling speedboat chase in the latter . After a run of six Bond movies , John Barry was given a break from scoring , and ' Beatles ' producer George Martin took his place . Again I think this was to the film's advantage , as Martin's score has a more contemporary feel . The theme song by Paul & Linda McCartney became a worldwide hit . Its my all-time favourite Bond song . In short , ' Live & Let Die ' was the shot in the arm the Bond series needed , and made Moore a major film star . Next to ' The Spy Who Loved Me ' , its easily the best Bond film of the ' 70's .
401422	7743887	56749	10.0	" Dad , I've got it wrong again ! "	I once accompanied my late uncle on a Saturday afternoon shopping trip . As we strolled around the centre , we spotted a smartly dressed man carrying a handbag ( they were briefly fashionable in the early ' 70's . In the ' To Alf A Grandson ' episode of ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , Mike ( Tony Booth ) is seen with one ) . I was prepared to say nothing , but my uncle came out with out with " Hello , Honky Tonk , how are you ? " . The man ignored the jibe , and carried on walking . He was probably used to it . A few shoppers laughed . I for one was deeply embarrassed . That was one of many catchphrases employed by the popular comedian Dick Emery , whose B . B . C . - 1 show was a fixture of Saturday night television for the best part of two decades . He was not strictly speaking an impressionist , rather than copy famous people , he had his own repertoire of outrageous comic characters , among them the buck-toothed ' The Reverend Chislet ' , a bespectacled spinster called ' Hettie ' whose determination to get a man knew no bounds , ' Ton-Up Boy ' , the lovable old codger ' James Maynard Kitchener Lampwick ' , ' Gaylord Screwsby ' , the bovver boy ( often accompanied by his similarly attired father , played by Roy Kinnear , who would try without success to give his son a masterclass in crime ) , the upper-class tramp ' College ' , camp-as-a-row-of-tents ' Clarence ' , and not forgetting sex-pot ' Mandy ' ( whose favourite saying was ' ooh you are awful , but I like you ! ' ) . Each week , these characters inhabited sketches usually written by John Warren and John Singer , beginning with a vox pop scene on film , in which a typically B . B . C . interviewer ( the late Gordon Clyde ) stopped passers-by to ask questions . Encountering Mandy , he wound up being pushed backwards into a hedge . It is impossible to make grand claims for Emery's show as being groundbreaking , but it was certainly amusing in a seaside postcard sort of way . A lot of hard work went into the show , what with Emery playing most of the roles , and viewers appreciated it . My favourite sketches featured him as ' Bert ' , an incompetent D . I . Y . man who invited his best friend Wol ( Reg Lye ) to his house whenever he wished to show off his latest creations . Once , he converted his coal cellar into a men's drinking club complete with bar and pool table ( which naturally fell apart when they tried to play on it ) . Another time Bert built his own film studio . Pat Coombs was often cast alongside the comedian , as his curler-headed neighbour . All together now : " Oo-er ! " . Emery's show attracted impressive guest-stars such as Kate O'Mara , Yootha Joyce , and David Jason . ' Lampwick ' , the old codger with the throaty chuckle , lived with his beloved daughter Lil ( Helen Fraser ) and her husband Ernie ( Victor Maddern ) , whom he did not get along with . So popular was he that the B . B . C . at one point contemplated giving him his own spin-off series . However , in 1981 , sensing that the format was becoming stale , Emery turned the show into ' Emery Presents ' , a six-part comedy thriller serial , of which two ( ' Legacy Of Murder ' and ' Jack Of Diamonds ' ) were made , the last of these transmitted posthumously as the star died in 1983 . We shall never know whether or not he would have stayed successful or been consigned to the dustbin of history along with so many other old school comics . In recent years , edited versions of his shows have been appearing at odd times on ' U . K . Drama Daytime ' on Sky T . V . It would be great to see his entire output on D . V . D . Emery may not have been groundbreaking , but was in his own way influential . Publicising his new B . B . C . series ' Harry Enfield's Television Programme ' in 1990 , the star admitted to having been a huge fan of Emery's when he was younger ( preferring him to ' Monty Python ' ) , and confessed that his show was a carbon-copy of his idol's . Emery may have been awful , but we liked him !
401625	7743887	78670	10.0	The Original ' One Foot In The Grave '	In his excellent book on ' Dad's Army ' , Graham McCann wondered why the B . B . C . had never repeated Roy Clarke's sitcom ' Potter ' , which originally starred Arthur Lowe . I have often wondered the same thing . We've all met a Redvers Potter ; you'll find one in any pub , sitting alone , drinking whisky , nose buried in ' The Daily Mail ' , speaking to no-one except the barman , either to order drinks or huff and puff about how socialism has destroyed Britain . ' Potter ' was a perfect role for Arthur Lowe , officious , grumpy , xenophobic ( " I love everything French . . . except the French ! " ) , there were similarities with ' Captain Mainwaring ' , as well as ' Harry Duckworth ' from the classic ' Galton & Simpson Playhouse ' edition ' Car Along The Pass ' . In the first episode , Potter retires from the family sweet manufacturing company ( ' Potter Mints The Hotter Mints ' ) . On his final day , he is appalled to find that the new owners have taken the nameplate off his door and removed most of the furniture and fittings . Even some of the wallpaper is missing . Potter then berates a secretary for her modern dress sense and argues with the man in the boiler room for trying to make off with his office carpet . Rather like Victor Meldrew years later , Potter finds himself with too much time on his hands , so decides to meddle in other people's affairs . For instance , giving his long-suffering neighbour ' Tolly ' Tolliver a lift to the railway station - even though its not where he wants to go . Spotting a small crowd gathered in the street , Potter assumes an accident has taken place , and , taking charge , reroutes traffic and sends for ambulances . It turns out that the gathering is watching a local artist at work . To confound Potter's embarrassment , he then finds himself stranded in the middle of the road , surrounded on both sides by vehicles . Potter's wife Aileen is so fed up at being taken for granted she has become an alcoholic without him noticing . Possibly the show's only flaw was the use of a laugh track . Clarke's lines are not your usual T . V . sitcom lines and the studio audience seems unsure how to react to them , giving the impression the show is less funny than it is . I found myself laughing in places where the audience was silent , such as when Potter asked rhetorically over a drink : " Have you ever known a really exciting Tuesday ? " . ' Potter ' would have been twice as funny without the laugh track . Thanks to Lowe's acting and Clarke's scripts , ' Potter ' was a hit . After two seasons , Lowe sadly passed on , and the role went to that fine actor Robin Bailey . Bailey did his best but Lowe proved too hard an act to follow .
401416	7743887	78690	10.0	The Private Eye Who Became A Private Ear	' Shoestring ' is , in my view , the finest detective series the B . B . C . has ever made . The same production team were responsible for the later ( and vastly inferior ) ' Bergerac ' , but it had something the Jersey-based show lacked - Trevor Eve . In his pyjama jacket , Beatles-styled mop ( Eve had once played Paul McCartney on stage ) and sporting a fashionable moustache , the character could easily have crossed the line into parody ( he also had a habit of sketching the people he met in the course of cases ) , but Eve made Eddie warm and believable . Shoestring was originally a computer programmer who'd lost his job as the result of a nervous breakdown . His landlady , Erica Bayliss , worked in the police archives , and was a big help to him as she had access to confidential files . After a case involving a dead prostitute , Eddie was offered his own show by Radio West . Nowhere was Eve's acting ability more impressive than the scene in the second episode where Eddie suffers a fit of nerves whilst on air for the first time . Admittedly , his cases were small beer by comparison with U . S . detectives such as ' Philip Marlowe ' - religious cults , fake antiques dealers , punk rockers and dangerous Christmas toys - but the scripts were good and the cast performed them excellently . Special mention must go to George Fenton for his wonderful music , and Sid Sutton for his titles . ' Shoestring ' was a big hit ( Cary Grant was reputedly a fan ) , even though its second season clashed with ' The Professionals ' on I . T . V . , and should have run for five years at least . But it was not to be . Fearing typecasting , Trevor Eve quit after two . Due to complicated music rights issues , we are unlikely to see ' Shoestring ' on D . V . D . for the foreseeable future . A great shame .
401054	7743887	57076	10.0	One Of The All-Time Bond Greats	Nowadays whenever a Bond film is trotted out on British television , the viewers ' usual response is ' oh god , not him again ! ' . It was very different in 1976 , the year ' From Russia With Love ' got its I . T . V . premiere . ' Dr . No ' debuted the year before to an audience of nearly twenty million . ' Bond ' on television in those days was an event akin to a Royal Wedding or the finale of ' Britain's Got Talent ' . Everyone watched . B . B . C . - 1 made no effort to complete - they ran John Huston's ' Moby Dick ' , starring Gregory Peck , for the umpteenth time . I had not seen the Connery Bonds before - my first taste of ' Bond ' on the big screen was ' Live & Let Die ' starring Roger Moore . ' Love ' begins with a nervous-looking Bond stalked through a garden at night , firing his Walther PPK at thin air . A blond man strangles him with a wire hidden in a wrist-watch . Lights snap on . Agents of S . P . E . C . T . R . E . ( the Special Executive for Counterintelligence , Terrorism , Revenge & Extortion ) appear . The killing has been carefully timed . The dead ' Bond ' is only a double . Psychopathic Red Grant ( Robert Shaw ) is specially selected for an important mission ; seething at the loss of their agent Dr . No , the organisation wants both to kill Bond and discredit the British Secret Service into the bargain . They use a beautiful young woman , Tatiana Romanova , by making it appear that she wishes to defect , bringing along a Russian cypher machine - the Lektor . She will only go if the agent sent to bring her back to London is James Bond . It is obviously a trap , but the chance of getting a Lektor is too good to pass up , so off Bond flies to Istanbul , taking with him a gadget-laden briefcase supplied by Q ( Desmond Llewelyn's first appearance in the role ) . This is a different Q to the stuffy , starchy character the world came to know and love . The film itself is quite different to its predecessor . Very Hitchockian , particularly the helicopter chase ( obviously inspired by the crop dusting plane scene in ' North By Northwest ' ) . Terence Young once again handles the directorial chores superbly , and gets first-rate support from editor Peter Hunt . As Bond , Connery is cool , elegant , sophisticated and slightly arrogant , you can see why even now his is still regarded as the definitive portrayal . The supporting cast are marvellous too , particularly Daniela Bianchi as ' Tatiana ' , Pedro Armendariz as ' Kerim Bey ' , Vladek Sheybal as ' Kronsteen ' , and Lotte Lenya as ' Rosa Klebb ' . S . P . E . C . T . R . E . boss ' Ernst Blofeld ' makes his debut , but is glimpsed rather than seen . The scene-stealer though is Robert Shaw as ' Red Grant ' . He looks as though he really could kill Bond . His fight with 007 aboard the Orient Express is still for my money the most impressively choreographed action sequence in the whole series . Having arranged Monty Norman's ' James Bond Theme ' for ' Dr . No ' , John Barry was promoted to composer , and turned in the first of several memorable scores . The title theme was by ' Oliver ! ' composer Lionel Bart , and sung by Matt Monro . Richard Maibaum's script is by and large faithful to Ian Fleming's book , with the addition of S . P . E . C . T . R . E . and a number of outdoor action scenes , including the speedboat finale . The structure is impressive ; the first part has the villains setting up the trap , the next sees Bond walking into it ( to obtain both the Lektor and the girl ) , and in the last he fights to stay alive as the jaws begin to close shut . When ' Love ' opened in 1963 , the world welcomed it with open arms , and Bond's future on the silver screen was assured . One year ago , ' Love ' secured the honour of becoming the first Eon Bond to be shown on the B . B . C . and how good it was to be able to watch one without all those annoying ad breaks , not to mention cuts . Alas I . T . V . continues to rape and pillage the 007 legacy ; most recently , the films were used as ' fillers ' on Saturday afternoons , a time usually reserved for children's movies and sports coverage . Bond deserves better .
401368	7743887	56960	10.0	" This Never Happened To James Bond ! "	Charlie Drake's previous films - ' Petticoat Pirates ' ( 1960 ) and ' Sands Of The Desert ' ( 1961 ) failed to set the world on fire , but with ' The Cracksman ' he came up with a little beauty . He plays master locksmith Ernest Wright , who becomes the unwitting dupe in a series of robberies . As you'd expect from a Charlie Drake comedy , there's plenty of slapstick , but also an unexpected element of pathos - when Wright gets out of prison and his former friends shun him , its a genuinely moving moment . The gang's plan is a little unbelievable ; they seem prepared to wait years for Ernest to acquire a criminal record , but its done so well you don't really care . George Sanders is his usual smooth self as the gang's leader , while Nyree Dawn Porter shows a real flair for comedy . In addition , the script manages to squeeze in parodies of ' Dr . No ' and ' Birdman Of Alcatraz ' . The prison scene features Ronnie Barker as a prototype ' Norman Stanley Fletcher ' . A cracker of a comedy !
400974	7743887	659327	10.0	The Final Round	When I saw a repeat of ' The Avengers ' episode ' The Cybernauts ' late one Friday night in 1969 , I assumed automatically that the writer - Philip Levene - had ripped off Dr . Who's arch-enemy ' The Cybermen ' . I found out later on that the Cybernauts had come first . What are Cybernauts ? Robot men , silver in colour , able to home in and kill designated targets by means of snapping necks with one sweep of an arm . The eerie ' whooshing ' sound they made made them ideal for imitating in the playground . Though they moved with a lumbering gait , you definitely would not want a Cybernaut on your tail . They remain the best remembered of all ' Avengers ' baddies , and it is perplexing why Don Macpherson did not use them in his script for ' The Avengers ' movie . An army of Cybernauts on the rampage would surely have looked great on the big screen . After two encounters with John Steed and Mrs . Emma Peel , the Cybernauts went quiet for a few years , before resurfacing in the third episode of ' The New Avengers ' in 1976 . ' House Of Cards ' featured some nice nods to the past , but here we got an outright homage . Levene having died , the job of resurrecting the metal meanies went to Brian Clemens . At the start of the episode , Steed is celebrating his birthday in the company of Gambit and Purdey . A dying agent bursts in , and tells them that Department operative Felix Kane ( Robert Lang ) is really a double agent . The New Avengers lay in wait to catch him red-handed passing secrets to a Russian agent in a car park , but Kane makes a break for it , his car colliding with a petrol tanker . One year later , and a disfigured , wheelchair-bound Kane is plotting revenge . His henchman Malov ( Oscar Quitak ) picks up a newly-released convict called Frank Goff ( Robert Gillespie ) . Goff built the Cybernauts , working from the instructions of the deranged Professor Armstrong . Goff leads Kane to a secret storehouse of Cybernauts . The robots are made to live again . . . One note of bad continuity aside ( Goff was never in either of the earlier Cybernauts episodes ) , this is a cracking yarn , and as good as anything to be found in the original series . As another commentator has noted , the late Robert Lang makes a wonderful villain , neatly combining aspects of the earlier Cybernaut controllers , like Professor Armstrong , Kane is wheelchair-bound , and like Paul Beresford , thirsts for revenge . The director was Sidney Hayers , who helmed ' The Cybernauts ' way back in 1965 . Spot The Future Star - Gwen Taylor , later to star in ' Duty Free ' , is ' Dr . Marlow ' , a sexy scientist whom Steed tells to get in a cupboard . He is trying to save her from a Cybernaut , but she thinks he is being suggestive . Gambit and Purdey seem to be hitting it off beautifully in the scene where they discuss Steed's previous skirmish with the Cybernauts . Their quick-fire repartee is strongly reminiscent of Steed and Peel's . Amusingly , when this was repeated in 1990 by H . T . V . , the continuity announcer Eiry Palfrey must have misread the ' T . V . Times ' synopsis because she said : " In tonight's New Avengers , the Cybernauts are back and the ghost of Emma Peel appears ! " . Eh ?
401482	7743887	723608	10.0	" I know his father ! He wears yellow trousers and stutters ! "	Alf's leg is broken as a result of him slipping on a freshly polished floor ( he thinks Else did it on purpose to try and claim insurance money ) and he is off work , confined to a wheelchair . She claims it was his own fault as he was drunk at the time . Left alone for hours in the dark , he is bored out of his mind and begs his family to bring him downstairs , which they do - with great difficulty . He is still miserable though , especially when Gran turns up , starts drinking whisky and talking about terminal illnesses . To get away from her , he goes to the pub . Else tries pushing both him and Rita's baby's pram simultaneously , but the effort proves too much and she walks off . Three youths push him the rest of the way . Leaving him outside , they take cigarettes off the landlord and tell him to put them on Alf's slate . He gives them crisps as a reward for their ' kindness ' . Mike finds the youths have drugged Alf's beer and painted a clown's face on him to use him for ' Penny For The Guy ' purposes . . . This was the last episode of Season 4 ( though a Christmas Special would follow shortly ) . Following a four year gap , ' Till Death Us Do Part ' had resumed production , and in glorious colour to boot . According to Mark Ward's new book ' A Family At War ' , the decision to revive Alf was partly motivated by the success of the American version ' All In The Family ' . The other reason was that I . T . V . had scored a batch of comedy hits such as ' On The Buses ' , ' Please Sir ! ' , and the ' Doctor ' series and the B . B . C . wished to compete , so they revived not only this but also ' Steptoe & Son ' , ' The Likely Lads ' and ' Sykes ' . Certainly the show benefited from the break . This being the ' 70's , there was a Tory Government in power and new targets for the humour . Joan Sims guested in most of the new shows as ' Gran ' , the gin-sodden geriatric . As was the case with Clive Dunn in ' Dad's Army ' , the actress - quite an attractive woman at that time - was able to portray old people convincingly . Else's indifference at her husband's discomfort is amusing , though it is sad to think that over a decade later she would be the one in the wheelchair . The ringleader of the tear-aways is Richard Speight , son of the show's creator / writer , who would reappear in ' In Sickness & In Health ' as Marigold's boyfriend ' Goldie ' . In an amusing in-joke , Alf refers to the boy's dad as someone who wears yellow trousers and stutters ! Both were characteristics of Johnny Speight . Alf would have his face repainted in an episode of the I . T . V . sequel ' Till Death ' , only then it was Rita's teenage son who did the deed . Funniest moment - Alf looking in a mirror and realising just why everyone is laughing at him !
401288	7743887	993414	10.0	" He's Wearing A Wig ! "	Picture the scene ; a man is idly browsing the goods on sale at a tobacconist's kiosk . The owner ( Paul Merton ) asks : " Can I help you ? " . " I'm just looking ! " the man says , to which the owner sarcastically replies : " You're not just looking . You're hearing as well . Now you're speaking . " . We cut to a field where over a soundtrack of bleating sheep , breaking glass and church bells , letters on telegraph wires spell out the show's title : PAUL MERTON THE SERIES . On a busy train , Paul is amused by a fellow passenger's obvious red wig , but says nothing . A ticket inspector enters the carriage , causing Paul to panic as he remembers he forgot to buy one . ' Wiggy ' is escorted to the guard's van for having a two year old ticket on his person . Relieved at not having been rumbled , Paul punches the air in triumph . In so doing , he draws attention to himself . In a publisher's office , McNulty , the author of a new book on Alfred Lord Tennyson , is sounded out for having crudely plagiarised other works . The entire twelfth chapter comes from a book on chickens . In the heat of the row both publisher and author reveal themselves to be fake characters in ' Mission : Impossible ' style masks . Several changes of identity later , they stand exposed as husband and wife . Cue emotional reunion . Back at the kiosk , Paul ( sporting a miniature office desk on his head ) tells us : " I've got a book at home about the paranormal . I did not buy it , it just appeared in my room one night ! " . I think by now you should have a fair idea of the general level of humour . Other surreal flights of fancy are set in a sauna bath , where Paul miraculously conjures up a pint and a cheese ommlette while imprisoned in a wooden box , Paul as a father who tells his lovely daughter Jennifer on her birthday she is ( wait for it ) NOT adopted , and a World War 2 P . O . W . sketch in which he covers for the escapees by carrying with him at all times a pole containing stuffed dummies designed to resemble the absent men . Merton's influences are plain for all to see : ' At Last The 1948 Show ' , ' Marty ' , ' Not Only But Also ' , and yes , ' Monty Python ' . He also brought back something that had been missing from television comedy for some time - visual humour . Alas the show did not make the impact it deserved . It ran only to two seasons , and is presently unavailable on D . V . D . Funniest moment - Paul's line : " My ambition is to ask Lee Harvey Oswald , can you remember where you were when Kennedy was assassinated ? " .
400736	7743887	699360	10.0	" Are you the head robber ? "	Our hero has landed a cushy job writing copy for an advertising agency ( nice work if you can get it ! ) . He hates it but is looking forward to his first pay check . But when it arrives he is not happy - after tax deductions it is not much higher than the money he got on the Dole . Furious , Shelley goes to the Tax Office to demand to know what they are playing at , and is pushed from pillar to post by a series of faceless clerks . On being told he can qualify for Mortgage Tax Relief , he tries to get one , but of course for that you need a bank account . . . After the disappointing ' Gainfully Employed ' , its back to form with a cracking episode which sees Jim doing what he is best at - being rude to practitioners of bureaucracy . Shelley's dismay is perfectly understandable , encapsulating one of the reasons why some people prefer the Dole to work . You are no better off really . One of the clerks he encounters is played by the gorgeous Marsha Fitzalan , who went on to be the faithless ' Sarah B'Stard ' in ' The New Statesman ' . I once saw her do a commercial for chocolate , and she managed to make Munchies incredibly sexy . The rest of the episode is taken up with Shelley's phone call to his prospective father-in-law . We do not hear what Mr . Smith is saying , but from Shelley's responses it sounds profane . In the four weeks it had been on air , ' Shelley ' achieved excellent ratings and reviews . Margaret Forwood , television critic of ' The Sun ' , even started a campaign among readers to ' Keep ' Shelley ' At The Top Of The Ratings ' . Then , disaster struck . Following the transmission of this episode , I . T . V . was blacked out by a strike that lasted approximately ten weeks . Viewers had to wait eight months for the remaining three episodes of Season 1 , when they were appended to the beginning to Season 2 . Had ' Shelley ' not been a hit , its likely they would never have been shown . Funniest moment - Shelley teasing Mrs . Hawkins by telling her that he and Fran plan on a nude wedding . " What's the matter ? " , he asks the shocked landlady , " Worried at having nowhere to put your carnation ? "
401117	7743887	824745	10.0	The Making Of A ' Dr . Who ' Classic	When ' Inferno ' was released on D . V . D . earlier this year , I nearly didn't buy it as my V . H . S . copy was still in good condition . Then I changed my mind , and thank goodness for that because then I'd have missed this cracking documentary . Opening with a brief recap of earlier Season 7 adventures , it swiftly moves onto the origins of Don Houghton's story . Outgoing producers Derrick Sherwin and Peter Bryant had decided to exile the Doctor to Earth and make longer stories , decisions the Script-Editor Terrance Dicks did not agree with . ' Inferno ' underwent two major rewrites ; firstly , to bring in some monsters ( Primords ) and secondly , accommodate the seven-episode length by flinging the Doctor into a parallel universe where he meets evil dopplegangers of his friends . In retrospect this second development can now be seen as the moment when the story took on the mantle of greatness . As you may have gathered , ' Inferno ' is my favourite ' Dr . Who ' story of all time , and I'm pleased to report that this documentary is fascinating throughout , full of interesting behind-the-scenes information and comments . Nice to see the cast and crew praising the late Douglas Camfield , even though most of the serial was helmed by Barry Letts . I agree with Nicholas Courtney when he describes the meshing of Camfield's and Letts ' work as ' seamless ' . John Levene seems not to have aged a day since 1970 ! As indeed has Ian Fairbairn , who played doomed technician ' Bromley ' . Its especially moving to hear Caroline John recalling the day she was told she was not coming back to ' Dr . Who ' . I felt the character of ' Liz Shaw ' should not have been dropped . Liz was a feisty , intelligent lady , far removed from the ' screamers ' of the show's monochrome years , and her presence enhanced ' Dr . Who ' immeasurably . Its the only decision Barry Letts took on ' Dr . Who ' with which I strongly disagree . Shame about the caption identifying the author of ' Spearhead From Space ' as Malcolm Hulke . It was , of course , the legendary Robert Holmes . Otherwise , a practically flawless programme .
401261	7743887	280876	10.0	Future Medicine	Dr . Roger Full ( Emrys Jones ) was struck off years before following the death of a patient . Since that time , he has sunk slowly into a morass of alcoholism , poverty and despair . His life changes dramatically one day when he finds a black bag containing medical instruments the like of which he has not before seen . The bag was accidentally left behind by an expedition of time travellers from the future . He is able to use these to cure cancerous tumours , as well as provide instant cosmetic surgery . Teaming up with the lovely Angie ( Geraldine Moffatt ) , he opens his own private clinic , soon people are parting with huge sums of money for his services . Naturally his miracle cures bring him to the attention of the authorities . But he has a fit of conscience and horrifies Angie by announcing that he intends donating the bag to medical science so that everyone can benefit . Not wishing to see a good money-making opportunity thrown away , she attacks him with a knife , killing him . The death of Full is noticed by the bag's original owners in the far future , and they deactivate it , making the instruments worthless . Unfortunately , Angie has chosen that precise moment to demonstrate a scalpel to a wealthy client by cutting her throat . . . Until recently , this was a lost episode . The copy in my possession is missing the first twenty or so minutes and the final grisly scene , but it still makes sense . It is a gripping tale , typical of this series . Good science fiction does not need flashy special effects , the story is the important thing . ' Dr . Who ' fans will recognise Emrys Jones ( who plays ' Full ' ) as ' The Master ' in the 1968 story ' The Mind Robber ' . Geraldine Moffatt a . k . a . ' Angie ' , is best known for her role in the iconic Michael Caine gangster movie ' Get Carter ' . C . M . Kornbluth's story was later remade in America for ' Rod Serling's Night Gallery ' .
401223	7743887	649322	10.0	" I've been had ! "	An episode of the underrated fifth season of ' Mission : Impossible ' . No tape recorder opening this time . We are plunged into the mission immediately . Barney Collier ( Greg Morris ) and Willy Armitage ( Peter Lupus ) have broken into the Interoco Chemical Plant somewhere in the Middle East ( how prophetic ! ) to destroy the formula for a deadly new chemical called Dehominant-B , which the regime intends using against a neighbouring country . Barney accidentally gets contaminated by the stuff , and is taken prisoner . Willy escapes . So now the I . M . F . have two problems to contend with - get Barney out before he dies , and complete the original mission . Breaking a cardinal rule , they decide to recruit an ' innocent ' - a drop-out scientist named Jerome Carlin ( the late Christopher Connolly ) . At first they offer him money to join them , but he refuses , so instead they make it appear as though his girlfriend has been kidnapped . He signs up for the trip . The journey to the laboratory involves a conduit tunnel . But then Carlin recognises Paris ( Leonard Nimoy ) and Doug ( Sam Elliott ) , and realising he has been conned , refuses to co-operate further . . . Not only a very tense episode , but a thought-provoking one as it brings into question the I . M . F . ' s ethics . In common with other young Americans at that time , Carlin bitterly resents the fact that his country is meddling in the affairs of others . Originally , the arguments were to have been a lot more robust , but Laurence Heath rewrote Marc Norman's script to bring it more into line with the show's adventure format . Connolly is good as the argumentative scientist . British viewers probably best remember him for his role in the long-running soap ' Peyton Place ' . Larry Linville , who plays ' Colonel Orlov ' , was the Bible-thumping ' Major Frank Burns ' in the seminal comedy series ' M . A . S . H ' . This marked the first time viewers saw the character of ' Doug ' , played by Sam Elliott , originally planned as a replacement for Peter Lupus ( until fans demanded his reinstatement ! ) . Episodes such as this helped bring a new dimension to the long-running show .
400656	7743887	71357	10.0	" Extraordinary Way To Clean Windows ! "	In the early ' 70's , a number of Sphere-published books , all credited to one ' Timothy Lea ' and whose titles were prefixed by the words ' Confessions Of A . . . ' , went on sale in Britain . I never bought one ( I was more into Agaton Sax ) , but a Form Five boy brought several to school , which he passed round behind the bike shed , the naughty bits underlined in red . They were the work of Christopher Wood , and their riotous blend of sex and slapstick made them bestsellers . In 1974 , producer Greg Smith turned the first into ' Confessions Of A Window Cleaner ' starring Robin Askwith as ' Timmy ' , a cheeky young Cockney whom the ladies adore . The director , Val Guest , had recently made another sex comedy - ' Au Pair Girls ' with Gabrielle Drake . Timmy's family is made up of half of the cast of the B . B . C . ' s ' Till Death Us Do Part ' - Dandy Nichols and Anthony Booth . Sheila White ( for me the sexiest bit of crumpet in the franchise ) played Timmy's blowsy sister ' Rosie ' , with Bill Maynard as his flat-capped Dad , who had a penchant for bringing home stuff from the Lost Property office where he worked . It amused cinema-going audiences in the ' 70's to see sitcom stars competing for attention with bare boobs and bums . At the start of ' Cleaner ' , Timmy is still a virgin , even after an encounter with a sexy stripper named ' Lil ' ( he makes love to her suspender belt by mistake ! ) but finally a customer called Jackie does the dirty deed . In the film's most notorious scene , she and Timmy make out in a kitchen awash with soap bubbles . Like ' Alfie ' , the story cheerfully bounds from one sexy encounter to another . Anita Graham pops up as an energetic Au Pair ( though her clothes disappointingly stay on throughout her scene ) , Melissa Stribling tries to seduce Timmy in a coal cellar , and Linda Hayden raises temperatures as a policewoman called ' Liz ' ( or ' Fanny The Fuzz ' as Sid disparagingly refers to her ) . The ' Confessions ' series has often been likened to the ' Carry On ' series , but I think a more realistic comparison is to be made with the ' On The Buses ' movies . Like ' Stan Butler ' , Timmy lives at home with his mother , sister , and brother-in-law . Interestingly , when Dandy Nichols backed out of the series , who did Smith replace her with ? Doris Hare , of course . Smith had the decency to acknowledge his debt to Peter Rogers at the time , while Tony Booth blasted the critics who panned ' Cleaner ' . ' The mere thought that this is the first in a series is enough to set the jaw solid ' sniffed one , while another stated simply : " Come back ' Carry On's ' , all is forgiven ! ' . The ' Confessions ' films were noticeably tamer than the books , which were full of bad language . But the public wholeheartedly embraced ' Cleaner ' and made it the most commercially successful film on release in 1974 , paving the way not only for three sequels but numerous imitators , such as the ' Adventures ' series . I'm on their side because ' Cleaner ' not only is good fun , but boasts a great soundtrack , and a first-rate cast clearly enjoying themselves . It would not be until the ' 90's that the ' Confessions ' finally made it to terrestrial television . Channel Five ( as it was then called ) garnered excellent ratings from the quartet . One in the eye for Mary Whitehouse !
400839	7743887	591027	10.0	" This is a man . . . and this isn't ! "	Mrs . Desiree Carthorse , the puritanical head of the ' Clean Up T . V . Campaign ' , hires The Goodies to make a sex education film entitled ' How To Make Babies By Doing Dirty Things ' . But she takes offence to the word ' gender ' in the opening credits , and suddenly our heroes are in trouble , with the public and media ranged against them . To clear their names , they go on television disguised as outspoken M . P . Sir Reginald Wheelbarrow , but the interviewer is not fooled . Bill becomes a B . B . C . producer and soon the airwaves are full of violent and sexually explicit programmes . Filming the death scene for the sexy pantomime ' Sinderella ' , Bill flips completely and wipes out the cast with a machine gun built into one of the cameras . . . Bill Oddie has often spoken of the umbrage he and his fellow Goodies took when , not long after transmission of the first episode , they received a fan letter from , of all people , Mrs . Mary Whitehouse . The Bespectacled Blue-rinsed One called their show ' clean family fun ' . Luckily she missed ' Caught In The Act ' ( featuring naked female backsides ) , ' Love The Police ' ( featuring Bill's naked backside ) , ' The Greenies ' ( featuring a stripper at work ) and even ' Tower Of London ' offers a quick shot of a topless woman . Determined to get into her bad books , the Goodies went all out to ridicule her and everything she stood for . Its easy to forget now just how despised she was . Here she is parodied by the brilliant Beryl Reid . Instead of saying ' sex ' , she says the first two letters , and uses her finger to make a cross in the air . Without even watching their film , she calls for it to be banned . Having eradicated television , she fears bored couples will have sex instead , and the episode ends with her standing in the street shouting ' Stop it ! ' . ' Sir Reginald Wheelbarrow ' is a take-off of the late Sir Gerald Nabarro , the ' Boris Johnson ' of his day , a rent-a-quote Tory M . P . famed for his handlebar moustache and outspoken views . Richard Wattis , sporting a dreadful wig , plays the television interviewer . In a bizarre ( even by Goodies ' standards ) climax , leather-clad , whip-wielding dominatrixes die Peckinpah-style , Oddie laughs maniacally , and the B . B . C . T . V . Centre goes up in an impressive display of pyrotechnics . Note the cheer from the audience ! Funniest moment - the Goodies ' sex education film . Its so coy as to beggar belief , and about as educational as showbiz gossip . No nudity is visible because both man and woman are covered from head to foot in sheets ! I wonder if Harry Enfield got the idea for his ' Mr . Cholmondely Warner / Mr . Grayson ' public information film spoofs from this ?
401090	7743887	81912	10.0	" Send Rodney For The Fish ! "	' Only Fools & Horses ' has experienced a slight fall from grace in recent years , with its reputation questioned by , amongst others , comedian Arthur Smith , who made unfavourable comparisons with ' The Office ' . Repeats have possibly resulted in overfamiliarity breeding contempt , as well as confusion ( the episodes being screened wildly out of sequence ) . Its certainly true that the post-1996 Christmas shows weren't up to standard , but all this is to ignore the series at its best . The fact it that ' Only Fools & Horses ' is a prime contender for the title of best British sitcom of all time . Brilliantly written and acted throughout . In 1981 , when it started , ' Only Fools ' was just another comedy . Each episode was thirty minutes long , the only regulars were Derek ' Del Boy ' Trotter , his brother Rodney , and their Grandad . Stories revolved around Del Boy's latest ' get rich quick ' scheme which , predictably , would fail badly . But as it developed , and steadily rose in popularity , it evolved into something else - a comedy soap , if you like . When it was expanded to 45 minute episodes , supporting characters such as ' Trigger ' , ' Denzil ' and ' Boycie ' became as much a part of the show as either Del Boy or Rodney . When the latter married Cassandra and the former began a relationship with Raquel , that was when it really hit the button . Those who claim that the show's humour is intrinsically dated are wrong because the show is essentially about human relationships and that theme will never date . Despite their constant bickering , Del Boy and Rodney are devoted to each other . When gangsters threatened Rodney , Del Boy agreed to take a beating on his behalf . A sitcom about hate is never going to have the longevity of one based on love . The death of Lennard Pearce in the mid-80's threatened to derail the show , but John Sullivan bravely decided to make Grandad's death into an episode , one that set the scene for the arrival of Uncle Albert , brilliantly played by Buster Merryfield . As other sitcoms come and go , ' Only Fools ' will always be around somewhere . My favourite episode - ' The Jolly Boys ' Outing ' . Just watching the Trotters and their friends having fun at the seaside is a sheer joy ! A word of warning - if you're thinking of getting your chandelier cleaned , don't call the Trotters , okay ?
401222	7743887	706356	10.0	Terror From The Past !	An unknown object is picked up on Alpha's scanners . It is Voyager One , a space probe of Earth origin launched during the 1970's to explore the universe , conveying a message of peace and goodwill . The probe is equipped with the Queller Drive - a revolutionary form of propulsion using fast neutrons . It proved dangerous , however , resulting in the destruction of an entire community , and its creator - Dr . Ernst Queller - was forced to go into hiding . The obvious solution is to blast Voyager 1 before it can reach the Moon . But Professor Bergman objects as it contains important information . While the debate rages , a physicist named Dr . Linden steps forward and identifies himself as Dr . Queller . He brings the probe down safely , but then a new menace appears . A fleet of space ships , under the command of Aarchon , Chief Justifier of the Federated Worlds of Sidon , arrives . Voyager 1 was responsible for the destruction of two of their outer worlds , and he intends to exact revenge by destroying the race who built it . . . I do not recall seeing this Johnny Byrne-penned episode during the show's premiere run in 1975 , nor during the 1978 and 1982 repeats on H . T . V . I cannot believe it was banned - if that was the case , it is hard to see why - but my first viewing was in 1992 when it was included as part of I . T . C . ' s video releases . This strong episode boasts for once a threat created by human technology . An Earth space probe also appeared in the memorable ' Six Million Dollar Man ' episode ' Death Probe ' and its sequel ' Return Of Death Probe ' , as well as the first ' Star Trek ' movie . Jeremy Kemp plays ' Linden / Queller ' , the genius who created the Drive with good intentions , but had to go into hiding on Alpha under an assumed name because of all the destruction it has wrought . In some ways , he is reminiscent of the ' Professor Seltzman ' character from the ' Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling ' episode of ' The Prisoner ' . Kemp , as you would expect , gives a fine performance . Once some of the Alphans discover his true identity , they resent the survival of the base being put into his hands . Paul Morrow is among them , his father was one of the casualties . Like I said earlier , I had to wait nearly twenty years to view this particular episode , but luckily it was worth the wait .
401352	7743887	591019	10.0	" Bom ! "	The Goodies set up a pirate radio station - Radio Goodies - located beneath a rowing boat in the English Channel . They also set up their own Post Office ( an early example of privatisation , surely ? ) in competition with the Royal Mail . But Graeme flips and begins laying plans for a pirate bus service , as well as the British Isles being towed away by submarines . . . This terrific episode rounded off the first series of ' The Goodies ' , and broke the established pattern by having one of the regulars go mad on some new idea , to the extent of threatening the world with it . Garden is on wonderful form here as the mad dictator . No guest-stars , and all the better for it . Funniest moment - Tim and Bill chasing people whilst inside red pillar boxes ! Bit Of Pointless Trivia : ' A Walk In The Black Forest ' was a hit for Horst Jankowski in 1965 .
400866	7743887	591008	10.0	" Miaow ! "	What ' The Ministry Of Silly Walks ' was to ' Monty Python ' , ' Kitten Kong ' is to ' The Goodies ' . It is quite simply the best-loved , best-remembered episode . Whenever I recommend this wonderfully crazy show to first-timers , I urge them to watch this one first because it contains all the things that made it so great . I have never seen the original version ( it went out smack in the middle of Season 2 ) alas , but it proved so successful it was remade with additional film sequences , and entered for The Golden Rose Of Montreux in 1972 . That it only won Silver makes one wonder how good the Gold winner must have been . It is impossible to imagine anything funnier than this . It starts with the Goodies opening their own veterinarian surgery - but one with a difference . Each day , they ride through London on their trandem , towing a large basket on wheels , into which people place their pets . The poor animals are thrown together ( cats and dogs , goldfish and snakes ) without any thought for their wellbeing . As the bike pedals away , the sounds of mewling , hissing , barking and growling can be heard coming from the basket . One patient in particular proves difficult to handle - a fluffy white kitten named Twinkle . Tim takes it for a walk in the park , but it drags him along behind it , eventually taking refuge in a tree . Graeme accidentally overfeeds the animal with growth serum and it expands to mammoth proportions , threatening the whole of London . The special effects may have dated , but there's no denying that the sight of Giant Twinkle , demolishing the G . P . O . Tower , is one of British television comedy's iconic moments . Even those who resist ' The Goodies ' surely cannot fail to laugh as Michael Aspel , acting as the B . B . C . ' s roving reporter , is swatted to the ground by a huge paw . One gag - two dogs singing ' Anything You Can Do , I Can Do Better ' - was recycled footage from Garden and Brooke-Taylor's ' Broaden Your Mind ' . For nearly two decades ' Kitten Kong ' held the honour of being the last ' Goodies ' to be shown on the B . B . C - going out as part of a retro T . V . festival in 1986 - until ' Winter Olympics ' was repeated in January 2006 . Funniest moment - dressed as mice , the Goodies take to the air and endeavour to inject the monster pussy with shrinking serum !
400800	7743887	296865	10.0	" I've heard of carrying the can , but this is ridiculous ! "	Legendary Scottish comedian Stanley Baxter made five lavish comedy spectaculars for L . W . T . in the ' 70's , of which this was the third . It begins with Baxter's radio announcer - ' Julie Hawn ' - introducing several spoof commercials ( including clever parodies of the Milk Tray and P . G . Tips ' Mr . Shifter ' ads ) . Then we move onto classic sketches such as ' Towering Quake 75 ' , a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of The Mafia , ' Police 3 And A Half ' ( with Baxter impersonating Shaw Taylor ) , and ' Los Paranoics ' , a Latin-American singing group whose membership has mysteriously expanded to include the Scottish broadcaster Fyffe Robertson . Some items go on a bit too long , most notably ' Faith To Faith ' , but there's no denying the fact that Baxter is a brilliant impersonator and every penny of the budget is up on screen . The obligatory Hollywood musical pastiche here is ' Born To Bitch ' , with Baxter as ' Vicki Lustre ' ( based on ' Vicki Lester ' - the Judy Garland character from ' A Star Is Born ' ) ' . The music , choreography and sets are spot on . Even if you do not like old musicals ( and I don't ) you will be impressed . On the down side , there are a number of racist jokes no-one would dare make now , and the scene where Baxter ( in drag ) moves to attack Denise Coffey's pigtailed little girl with a bread knife is surprisingly graphic for a comedy show . Even so , a tremendous piece of entertainment .
400799	7743887	296864	10.0	" In my experience , politicians don't like being sent up ! "	Like Morecambe and Wise , Stanley Baxter gave up making weekly shows to concentrate on hour-long ( fifty minutes minus the commercials ) specials , usually screened in the Autumn or just before Christmas . This enabled him to ensure they were of the highest possible standard ; a good deal of thought and hard work went into their making and it shows . His second L . W . T . extravaganza contains some of his best-remembered sketches , including a hilarious parody of the period drama ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' with Baxter playing Mrs . Bridges , Rose ( Jean Marsh admired his impersonation ) and Hudson . As the series was still in production at the time , Baxter was able to film on the very same sets used in the show , most notably the kitchen and drawing room . ' Thumpalong with Reg Varnish ' sent up Reg Varney's 1973 A . T . V . show , and ' Nationwide ' enabled Baxter to display his mastery of regional accents . The ' Hollywood Canteen ' segment is one of Baxter's finest ; during World War Two , Nazi sympathising showbiz agent Willard Pringle stages a star-packed show intended to boost the morale of U . S . forces , but the songs have been rewritten so that they will now have the opposite effect , hence Jimmy Durante sings ' I'm The Guy That Joined The S . S . ' , Carmen Miranda goes ' I-I-I-I Hate Democracy ' , and Jimmy Cagney proclaims he is a ' Yankee Double-Dealer ' . Stunning choreography by Norman Maen and brilliant lyrics by Ken Hoare . This sketch ought to have closed the show , instead of simply rounding off the second act . The least successful item is ' supposing the television news was done in the style of ' The Sun ' . Anyone who has looked at I . T . N . recently will see it has become a frightening reality . A brilliant and touching number is ' Sitting On A Cloud ' in which Baxter , as Maurice Chevalier , is in Heaven , ruminating on how glad he is to be deceased . The song includes the daring lyric ' Where I used to spread my joie de vivre , now Brando spreads butter in Paree ' , a reference to the most famous scene in the notorious ' Last Tango In Paris ' . ' 2001 : A Royal Wedding Odysssy ' closes the show and while its good fun , ends the show on a full stop rather the exclamation mark it should have had . A member of the British Royal Family is to marry the Scottish singer Zena Lavaroni , and the wedding turns into an excuse for a mass public phone-in . The final scene in which the Royal Balcony descends at Buckingham Palace and a dance ensues is as disrespectful as anything later found in ' Spitting Image ' . Funny though this was at the time , its sad to watch now in the knowledge that the real Lena Zavaroni did not live to see 2001 . ' Moving Picture Show ' scooped three B . A . F . T . A . S in 1975 , for Design , Best Light Entertainment Programme and Best Light Entertainment Performance . Baxter beat out Arthur Lowe in ' Dad's Army ' , Ronnie Barker in ' Porridge ' , and Michael Crawford in ' Some Mothers Do Ave Em ' . Quite an achievement . Director / producer David Bell died in 1990 , and I . T . V . screened ' Moving Picture ' by way of a tribute .
401364	7743887	88484	10.0	The Elisabethan Sitcom	' Blackadder 2 ' provoked outrage when first broadcast in the U . K . Those who'd liked the first series were extremely unhappy at the show's reformatting ; Nina Myskow , television critic of ' The News Of The World ' bestowed on Rowan Atkinson her infamous ' wally of the week ' title . Its only with the benefit of hindsight can we see now that the changes were absolutely spot-on ; Edmund becoming a sarcastic cad , Baldrick turning stupid , and the expensive film sequences dropped in favour of stronger characterisations and tighter plots . Without the likes of Brian Blessed to constantly upstage him , Atkinson was free to dominate the show . Ben Elton replaced Atkinson as Richard Curtis ' co-writer - another wise move . As the squeaky-voiced ' Queenie ' , Miranda Richardson was simply outstanding . Tom Baker played ' Captain ' Redbeard ' Rum ' in one episode , a tour-de-force of over-the-top acting . The weight of public opinion gradually swung behind ' Blackadder 2 ' - its now regarded as better than its predecessor .
401289	7743887	129690	10.0	" Look It Up In Your Cone-tract ! "	Failed sports commentator and chat-show host Alan is sacked from ' Radio Norwich ' by his new boss , Tony Hayers , and goes berserk in a restaurant , running around with a piece of cheese . As the series develops , he tries to maintain a public profile , even though the doors are closing on him . Steve Coogan's performance is a masterclass in comedy , the sitcom format enabled him to bring out different sides to his character , such as his lap dancing fantasies . My favourite episode was ' Alan Attraction ' - lovely performance from Julia Deakin as ' Jill ' . Of the supporting cast , Sally Phillips made the biggest impact as Sophie , the giggling receptionist though Felicity Montagu gave her competition as Lynn , Alan's beleaguered P . A . The second season took Alan away from The Linton Travel Tavern , gave him a Ukrainian girlfriend , and had him living in a caravan next to a site where a house is under construction . Predictably , it wasn't as good as the first , although two episodes - ' Brave Alan ' and ' Never Say Alan Again ' - were simply outstanding .
401005	7743887	400143	10.0	The Majority Are Not Always Right	One type of programme British television excelled at in the ' 70's was the one-off drama . With the likes of Jack Rosenthal , David Mercer , Colin Welland , Barrie Keefe and Howard Schuman writing these , it was no wonder they were good . ' Against The Crowd ' was an anthology of plays about society's outsiders . Penned by ' Quatermass ' creator Nigel Kneale , ' Murrain ' starred David Simeon as ' Alan Crich ' , a veterinarian surgeon who goes to a remote country village to investigate a possible outbreak of swine fever and instead finds a community living in terror of a local woman - Mrs . Clemson - who they suspect of being a witch . The poor old lady is held responsible for everything from a drought to a mysterious virus affecting the shopkeeper's son . Crich is asked by crusty old farmer Beeley ( played by Bernard Lee ) to throw a bag of soil ( upon which everyone in the village has walked ) over the woman . Needless to say , he refuses . He finds Mrs . Clemson a lonely , unhappy woman living in squalor , and offers to help out by bringing groceries . In doing so , the vet becomes the focus of the villager's blind hatred . . . The play works as a perfect allegory of modern society ; in particular , the shameful way minorities are often blamed for the world's ills . The villagers are convinced that Mrs . Clemson is a witch and nothing will budge them from this view , in the same way that immigrants are scapegoated nowadays by vote-seeking politicians . David Simeon is largely known for comedy roles in series such as ' End Of Part One ' , but here he gives an outstanding dramatic performance as ' Crich ' . I doubt whether ' Murrain ' could be made today . There's no sex , violence and swearing , and it ends on a deliberately ambiguous note . It is well written , acted and thought provoking . You will find the play as an extra on the ' Beasts ' D . V . D . and I have to say that I found it better than the series itself . Two connections with the James Bond films ; Bernard Lee , who plays ' Beeley ' , was 007's boss ' M ' , and the music was by Monty Norman , composer of ' The James Bond Theme ' .
400878	7743887	71060	10.0	" Oh , Eric ! "	In the early ' 70's , the B . B . C . revived several hit sitcoms from the previous decade , including ' Steptoe & Son ' , ' The Likely Lads ' , ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , ' Whacko ! ' , and of course , ' Sykes ' . I . T . V . had been enjoying success with the likes of ' On The Buses ' , the ' Doctor ' series , and ' Please Sir ! ' and the B . B . C . wanted to compete . In the new medium of colour , the resurrected shows took on a new lease of life . Each week , the pounding of a drum would signal the start of a new ' Sykes ' episode . The new show was much the same as the earlier one ; he still lived in Sebastopol Terrace ( though at number 28 , not 24 ) with twin sister Hattie ( Hattie Jacques ) , and the next-door neighbour was the pompous Charles Fulbright Brown ( Richard Wattis ) . Added to the mix were Deryck Guyler ( fresh from ' Please Sir ! ' ) as a policeman with a fondness for food named ' P . C . Turnbull ' ( known to his friends as ' Korky ' ) , and Eric had an admirer in the shape of Madge from the bread shop ( Joan Sims ) who called him ' Ricky ' and kept him supplied with cakes . Korky's wife was never seen , but her reedy voice ( courtesy of Eric ) sounded not unlike that of ' Minnie Bannister ' from ' The Goon Show ' . Eric's character was that of an overgrown boy , constantly trying out new things ( such as building his own burglar alarm or redecorating ) but never quite getting the hang of them . Hat ( or ' Harriet ' as he often called her ) was like a mother figure , always telling him off but defending him when others did the same . She frequently talked to the cuckoo clock on the wall , which she called ' Peter ' . In one episode , Eric and Hattie returned from holiday only to find an old tramp ( Roy Dotrice ) had moved in and made himself at home ( Eric had left the front door open ! ) . In another , they went to a holiday camp where Eric caused chaos by refusing to get up early in the morning . Another memorable episode had him getting a job in a factory , and almost causing a strike by working too slow and then too fast ! When Eric , Hattie and Korky went caravanning , they fell out and hurled plates of porridge at one another ! Another time they bought a boat and almost got blown up by a mine left over from W . W . 2 . " Its alright ! " , said Hat : " I think its one of ours ! " . Some of the early episodes were remakes of the ' 60's shows , such as ' Sykes & A Stranger ' . The original featured Leo McKern as an ex-con who returns to honour a old childhood promise to marry Hattie . For the remake , Eric enlisted the services of his old friend from ' The Goon Show ' days Peter Sellers ( in a rare B . B . C . sitcom appearance ) . ' Sykes ' blend of visual and character driven comedy made it a big hit which ran for the remainder of the decade . Wattis sadly passed on in 1975 , and the show continued but was noticeably poorer for his absence . Joy Harington came aboard as another neighbour - Miss Rumbelow . It ended in 1979 with the appalling ' The B . B . C . Honours Sykes ' . I say appalling because it ruined the illusion that the show was not a sitcom ! In 1980 , Hattie died . The B . B . C . wanted Eric to continue alone , but he rightly declined . The chemistry between the leads had made ' Sykes ' special . Repeats have been few and far between . Network issued the 1972 series on D . V . D . in 2004 , but its ongoing dispute with the B . B . C . means we are unlikely to get more releases , and ' 2entertain ' do not seem keen to pick up the baton . A few years back , the now-defunct satellite channel ' U . K . Drama Daytime ' put on most - but not all - of the shows . They showed that ' Sykes ' still has the ability to delight and amuse in equal proportions .
400960	7743887	363653	10.0	Grand Slam is Epic !	Rather like the ' Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads ? ' episode ' No Hiding Place ' , the B . B . C . Wales comedy film ' Grand Slam ' is revived whenever there's a major sporting event , only here its rugby . You would think it would be easy to tire of , but no , each viewing is an absolute joy . It traces the exploits of a group of Welshmen as they travel to Paris for the final game in the season . And what a motley lot they are ; ' Caradog ' the undertaker , seeking a girl he loved in the war whom he knows only as ' butterfly ' , ' Mog ' , who will hit any Frenchman who dares besmirch the name of Phil Bennett ; ' Glyn ' the ' Viva Zapata ' mustachioed ladies ' man ; camp-as-a-row-of-tents boutique owner ' Maldwyn ' , and ' Will Posh ' , who hates foreign beer so much he takes along his own . Caradog finds that the bistro in which he met his butterfly woman is now a strip-club , while she has degenerated into a seedy alcoholic . His son Glyn scores with her sexy daughter Odette ( Sharon Morgan ) , who shields him from the police when they raid the place . The humour is natural , coming out of the characters themselves . The depiction of the Welsh is certainly more believable than that of say , ' The Magnificent Evans ' , which could have been set on another planet . Great performances throughout , including google-eyed Hugh Griffith as ' Caradog ' , Sion Probert as ' Maldwyn ' ( don't think they could get away with such a character now ! ) , and , of course , Windsor Davies as ' Mog ' ( next to ' It Ain't ' Alf Hot , Mum ' , this is his finest performance ) . Comic highlights include Mog's horror on realising he has to share a bed with the gay Maldwyn , the latter's attempts to explain what a bidet is for , Mog's striptease , and his walking through the Parisian streets in his underwear to get to the game . The only thing wrong with the production is that a sequel never got made . These strong characters deserved a second or even third outing . In response to the user who said you need to be Welsh in order to enjoy the film , I say no more than you need to be Irish to appreciate ' Father Ted ' . Sixty minutes of inspired comedy . And the Gren cartoons are great too ! ADDENDA : On the very day I wrote this review , Wales won the Grand Slam !
401686	7743887	1079616	10.0	" If I see your cat again , I'll have his tail for a lavatory brush ! "	Let me get one thing straight - this is not the B . B . C . ' s ' Born & Bred ' from a few years back , but a Thames comedy series written by Douglas Livingstone . It ran from 1978-80 and centred on the exploits of two London families - the poor Tonsleys , among them grumpy ex-music hall artiste Tommy ( the priceless Max Wall ) and the well-off Benges , headed by the ultra-snobbish Frank ( James Grout ) . I recently acquired the second series , of which this is the first episode . Marge Benge ( ' Love Thy Neighbour's Kate Williams ) is at a railway station , having walked out on dopey husband Ray ( Gorden Kaye ) . She ( literally ) bumps into an attractive young woman named Nina Farthing ( Sally Grace ) . Nina recognises Marge from an old family photo . She has come to visit Tommy , who is her real father , and whom she has not seen since she was eight . Tommy's wife Rose ( Constance Chapman ) is quite happy at having her husband's long-lost illegitimate daughter living with them . Their own daughter Iris ( Susan Tracy ) has gone on a cruise . " She always did like sailors ! " , says Rose . Meanwhile , Frank Benge is organising his grandchildren's christening as though it were a military campaign , with guests being designated code names and numbers . The new area manager of Frank's insurance agency has agreed to be the godfather ( Frank hopes he will get promotion for this ) . Everyone is naturally confused by his plans . Frank has not invited the Tonsleys . But when Rose turns up unexpectedly and begins nosing around , he has no choice but to relent . Rose goes home to tell Tommy , who is not at all pleased . He has made alternative arrangements for the christening day . Without telling his wife , he has sold their home and bought a new flat . The first Rose knows of this is when a removals van pulls up outside the front door . Horrified , she looks herself in the toilet and refuses to come out . Tommy goes off to Molly Peglar's pub with Ray , Paul Redstone ( Ian Redford ) and Stephen Benge ( Richard O'Callaghan ) , the naive young man who nearly married Iris ( and got cold feet at the altar ) . Paul is depressed at the thought of losing his individuality by being part of the Benge clan . All proceed to get legless . Angered at the absence of his son-in-law ( and most of the other invited guests too ) from the christening , Frank decides to that it should proceed regardless . More troubles ensue for Tommy when he arrives at the new flat only to find the owner ( Paul Luty ) has changed his mind about selling . Tommy orders that all his furniture be put back in his old house . This in turn brasses off the man who had bought Tommy's house - he had planned to move in that very day . Luckily Nina is on hand to administer some of her legendary ' Personal Services ' . . . Though my copy was not terribly good ( containing some iffy editing around the commercial breaks ) , I found it an absolute joy to watch . The cast are uniformly great , with Max Wall and James Grout fabulous as ' Tommy Tonsley ' and ' Frank Benge ' respectively . And though it is a large cast , no-one gets sidelined . All play their roles to perfection . A critic at the time likened this to ' Till Death Us Do Part ' but personally I found it closer in style to ' A Bit Of A Do ' . Whereas that David Nobbs-scripted show was hampered slightly by the format ( the same people meeting each week at different social functions ) that was not a problem here . The christening scene is hilarious ; as it proceeds , the drunken guests enter the church one at a time and annoy the vicar by providing explanations for their lateness . So that is one episode down . I've five more to go . I cannot wait to see them . ( If you're reading this , Tim Beddoes of ' Network ' , please push this show up in the D . V . D . release schedules a bit quicker , would you ? )
401300	7743887	641213	10.0	Espionage In Greece	Of the thirty episodes of ' Suitcase ' , I would say that this is probably my favourite . Though primarily a detective show , occasionally spy stories featured , of which this is one . Dalby ( Vincent Ball ) , an oceanographer , walks away from his job just minutes before a board meeting is due to begin , taking with him a self-penned report into the viability of deep-sea farming in the Adriatic . He flies to Greece where he tries to sell the report to foreign powers . McGill is hired to persuade Dalby to return to London . But Dalby has teamed up with American agent Packard ( Rex Everhart ) , and they are making mysterious trips into the Mediterranean in a speedboat . When McGill looks round the boat , he is attacked and thrown overboard , nearly drowning . He is saved by Dalby . Dalby's theft of the report was simply a cover for a much bigger operation . The Russians are planning to build a secret submarine base , an Albanian scientist has obtained the plans , which he intends passing on to Packard . Dalby is there to verify the plans ' authenticity . But the two men have underestimated the scale of the opposition - in the area is sinister enemy agent Rudnik ( Peter Arne ) . . . Wilfred Greatorex's script has a ' Danger Man ' feel to it , effectively deglamourising espionage . There are no women in this episode ( apart from Dalby's secretary , seen fleetingly at the start ) . Everyone's motives are suspect and no-one can be trusted . Even McGill is never sure just what is going on , and the best he can do is to stay alive . Vincent Ball , who plays ' Dalby ' , is an Australian actor who lived here in the ' 60's , appearing in amongst other things the film ' Carry On Cruising ' . Peter Arne , cast as ' Rudnik ' , was a familiar British supporting actor , who made headlines when he was murdered in 1982 . Ed Bishop , later to star as ' Commander Ed Straker ' in Gerry Anderson's ' U . F . O . ' , has a small role as an American agent . Don Chaffey , the director , made more ' Danger Man ' episodes than anyone else , and also worked on ' The Prisoner ' . This was his only ' Suitcase ' outing . It is the ending which gives the episode much of its impact . Mac escapes from Greece with the plans , and on returning to London , asks a C . I . A . agent what he intends doing about Packard and Dalby ( both were captured and shipped to Albania to stand trial ) . " Plainly , McGill , we never heard of them ! " , he snaps . The callous abandonment of these men by their own side leads one to conclude that being forced out of American Intelligence was in fact a blessing in disguise for McGill .
401127	7743887	240285	10.0	Eric & Ernie Plunge Into The Thames	A battered old van bearing the legend ' B . B . C . T . V . ' stops alongside the Thames Television studio at Teddington Lock , London . The rear doors open , and two figures in raincoats and flat caps are flung out . As it speeds off , they regain their composure , and are greeted by a camp-sounding producer . " Welcome to Thames ! " . The new arrivals - Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise - look at one another . " This is just like the B . B . C . ! " , says Ernie , to which Eric responds : " Only quicker ! " . Yes , after ten years , the unthinkable had happened . Morecambe and Wise had jumped ship , leaving the B . B . C . to join Thames T . V . They would not be the first comedians to do this , of course , Benny Hill took the same route a decade before . But Eric and Ernie had seemed so at home on the B . B . C . , so much a part of it , that a move to the commercial channel looked as likely as Granada surrendering production of ' Coronation Street ' to B . B . C . Wales . Indeed Eric had decisively ruled out the possibility of such a move a year before it actually happened . " There's no way we're going over to I . T . V . ! " , he had stated . The first show they did for Thames went out on 24th October 1978 . As it was their first since their record breaking Christmas Show the year before - watched by a staggering 28 million people - a lot was expected of it . Eddie Braben , their regular writer ( and arguably the man behind their greatest television triumphs ) was still under contract to the B . B . C . , hence new writers needed to be found . Or rather a pair of old ones . John Junkin and Barry Cryer had written at least one of Eric and Ernie's B . B . C . Christmas shows , and seemed the right men for the job ( like their predecessors Dick Hills and Sid Green , they made brief appearances as themselves ) . That first show contained all the familiar ingredients - songs , sketches ( including one of Ernie's legendary dreadful plays ) , and guest stars . Continuing the tradition of great British actresses appearing alongside the lads ( such as Glenda Jackson and Diana Rigg ) , Judi Dench ( before she was made a Dame ) joined the club . Donald Sinden ( then appearing as stuffy ' Robert ' in the sitcom ' Two's Company ' ) did a sketch entitled ' Butler Of The Year ' , before singing ( if that's the right word ) ' You've Either Got Or You Haven't Got Style ' . Old favourites Ann Hamilton and Peter Cushing ( still after his money ) returned . Leonard Sachs , chairman of ' The Good Old Days ' , made a fun cameo in a spoof version of ' Dr . Jekyll & Mr . Hyde ' . Amongst the musical numbers was a fabulous recreation of ' I Want To Talk Like You ' from Disney's ' Jungle Book ' with Eric and Ernie miming to the soundtrack . In short , it was every bit as good as their earlier B . B . C . shows . So why hasn't history been kinder to their Thames work ? Possibly due to massive public affection for the former . When it went out originally , what do you think B . B . C . - 1 were showing at the same time ? It was ' Morecambe & Wise At The B . B . C . ' . Yes , you read it correctly . To act as a spoiler , Bill Cotton Junior scheduled a repeat to overlap with the start of their first Thames special . The continuity announcer was even instructed to describe it as ' the best years of Morecambe & Wise ' , cattily implying that the new show would in some way be inferior . Many agreed - the Thames shows never got the high ratings as those of the B . B . C . - but even so I do not think they were anywhere near as bad as chroniclers of Morecambe and Wise's history have liked to make out . The decline in their fortunes only came about when Eric suffered a second major attack , necessitating the need for a scaling down of their act , meaning that their later work came across as tired and flat . Even Braben's return did not help matters . They really should have called it a day . Instead they ploughed on , their shows continuing until the end of 1983 . Eric died a few months later . Now that the Thames shows are available on D . V . D . , we can see that they are a lot better than they have been given credit for . Morecambe and Wise continue to bring us sunshine after all these years .
401120	7743887	563082	10.0	" There's something fishy going on here ! "	Loftus ' quest for a knighthood continues . . . After showing a Harley Street consultant named Sir Desmond around the Research Unit , Loftus notices he has left behind his little black bag , so tells Duncan to return it . Duncan's car , with the bag inside , is taken by Paul , wishing to impress his beautiful date . Duncan thinks it has been stolen and informs the police . Finding it outside a classy restaurant , Duncan takes it back . Paul too informs the police . Patrolmen arrest Duncan and take him to the station , believing him to be a thief . He tells the Sergeant who he is . But Paul is there also , and is also calling himself ' Dr . Duncan Waring ' . . . George Layton had written a number of episodes for ' At Large ' under the alias ' Oliver Fry ' , but by the time of ' In Charge ' felt confidant enough to use his real name . Just as well because this is a cracking episode , with lots of farcical twists and turns , and a hilarious performance from Benny Hill regular Bob Todd as the befuddled Police Sergeant . Jonathan Lynn , who played ' Danny Hooley ' in Series 2 of ' In The House ' co-authored the script . Good continuity - Dr . Aziz from ' The Black & White Medical Show ' is mentioned briefly . Apparently his last act before leaving the hospital was to help Paul with his wine making ! Funniest moment - Loftus arriving at the Police Station , and announcing himself . With three doctors currently in his cells , the Sergeant looks aghast at the arrival of yet another !
401688	7743887	56189	10.0	" What you don't see you'll never miss ! "	Ian Hendry shot to fame as the star of the first series of ' The Avengers ' in which he played crime busting ' Dr . David Keel ' , with Patrick Macnee as his sidekick ' John Steed ' . He then left to pursue a career in film , leaving Macnee to assume star status in the show ( which became an international hit ) . Hendry made several films , of which ' Live Now - Pay Later ' was one . In it , he played ' Albert Argyll ' , a door-to-door salesman for ' Callendar's Credit Stores ' . Slick , quick-witted , irresistible to women , this man could sell anything to anybody . As a bonus , he gets to sleep with some of his customers . Indeed early on in the film one of them , called ' Treasure ' ( June Ritchie ) turns up at the shop , demanding to see Albert . He has run out on her , leaving her to bring up a child born out of wedlock , as well making her responsible for a mass of bills . He is out on his rounds , so she vents her anger by wrecking the shop . As the film progresses , her anger subsides and she and Albert once more become an item . When he is promoted to manager , he takes her to the shop and they fool around using the goods ( Albert does a stunningly brilliant ' Charlie Chaplin ' impression at one point ) . But he bites off more than he chew , and his boss Mr . Callendar ( John Gregson ) demotes him back to salesman . Treasure goes off Albert too , leaving him alone once more . But is he downhearted ? Is he heck ? As the movie ends , he once is out and about ( he has a habit of jumping out of his van while it is still moving ) and working his charm on a new customer , called Coral ( Justine Lord ) . Another reviewer has rightly commented on the similarity between Hendry's ' Albert ' and Michael Caine's ' Alfie ' . I have always believed that Hendry deserved greater success than he ultimately got - he should have been up there with Oliver Reed and Richard Harris and Stanley Baker as a major international star . He had the talent . He just never found the right role ( like Reed and Harris he also had a terrible drink problem . My late father-in-law once told me Hendry came into his local pub one afternoon , and stood a round ) , becoming instead a supporting star , albeit a good one , appearing in ' The Hill ' ( opposite Sean Connery ) , ' Get Carter ' ( opposite Michael Caine ) , ' The Internecine Project ' ( opposite James Coburn ) and my favourite Vincent Price picture - ' Theatre Of Blood ' . In all these films he was marvellous . June Ritchie , who plays ' Treasure ' , holds the distinction of being the first topless woman in a major British film - John Schlesinger's ' A Kind Of Loving ' , also made in 1962 . She was also the second topless woman in a major British film , as she takes a bath in Albert's flat . She too was tipped for stardom , which never materialised . All British films of these period seemed to have wonderful supporting casts , and this one is no exception - Nyree Dawn Porter , Geoffrey Keen , Peter Butterworth , Bridget Armstrong , Jeannette Sterke , and an early sighting of Peter Bowles . Particularly impressive is Liz Fraser as ' Joyce Corby ' , wife of an ambitious Councillor . She is up to her neck in debt and when the bailiffs come knocking , flees from the house in terror - only to get knocked down and killed . For anyone accustomed to her bubbly roles in the ' Carry On ' series , it is quite shocking stuff . Writer Jack Trevor Story and Jay Lewis had earlier collaborated on a dire wartime comedy starring Bill Travers and Spike Milligan called ' Invasion Quartet ' , so it makes this film's quality all the more surprising . Lewis only made one more film after this - the silent comedy ' A Home Of Your Own ' with Ronnie Barker - before his death in 1969 . So this works both as a cautionary tale of the dangers of getting heavily into debt , and a comedy with charming acting from the leads . It really deserves an official D . V . D . release .
401616	7743887	667837	10.0	A Traitor In The White House	Senator William Lyons Selby is the favourite to be the next President of the U . S . A . The Chinese Communists know this , and have created a perfect double using a revolutionary ' molecular plasticity ' serum . The night before the election , Selby is quietly assassinated and the double takes his place . As expected , he wins by a landslide . On entering The White House , the double starts to undermine U . S . defence and foreign policy . His daughter notices the sudden change in her father's character , as do his aides . But how do they prove he is an impostor ? The second broadcast episode of ' The Outer Limits ' is noticeably different from all others ; being more of a political thriller akin to Richard Condon's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' . The only fantasy element is the method used to turn a Chinese agent into Selby's double . Anti-Communist propaganda ? Certainly . But in 1963 the West did feel genuinely threatened by the East , and this episode caught the mood of the time . As Selby , the late Sidney Blackmer is superb , one could easily picture someone like him becoming President . The only false note struck by this chilling episode is the melodramatic finale in which the plot is exposed in the middle of a White House reception . I must mention Dominic Frontiere's eerie music , definitely a major factor in this episode's success .
401333	7743887	563039	10.0	" I do like your leg ! "	Loftus sacks Dick for making one mistake too many . Unable to get him to change his mind , Duncan resigns in protest . Out of work , he and Dick sign up as ship's doctors aboard the passenger liner M . S . Begonia . They look forward to a new life of sun , sea and . . . surgery . And being free of Loftus . But they've a shock in store . . . The title refers to the unusual nicknames given by the sailors to the medical staff ; ' Sir John ' ( Duncan ) is ' surgeon ' , ' Baby Doc ' ( Dick ) means ' junior surgeon ' . Alan Tew's theme has been given a nautical remix , and excellent it is too . ' Sea ' gets off to a splendid start with this Gail Renard / Phil Redmond scripted opener . With many of the original cast and crew having moved on , it took the opportunity to look back and remind the viewer how far the characters had come in a short space of time . Duncan's fierce defence of Stuart-Clark is proof of the bond of friendship between them . I doubt whether such a scene would have been possible in the earlier series . There's a lovely moment near the beginning where Dick and Duncan plan a surprise farewell party at St . Swithins , only to realise they're the only ones left from their student days . Collier moved on three months before , while the Binghams are bringing up triplets ( ! ) . The past is represented by a series of monochrome snapshots ( Upton is in a few ) backed up by a mellower arrangement of the theme . Even Dick sheds a tear for days gone by as the sequence ends . Before sentimentality takes over completely , we move onto a naval outfitters ' shop , where Duncan and Dick wreak havoc pretending to be Zorro and Long John Silver . Using a plot device borrowed from the film ' Doctor In Trouble ' , the new Captain is the twin brother of Loftus , enabling the role to be played by the same actor . Funniest moment - Duncan and Dick arriving at what they think is their ship , only to find it is not what they expected . Rats infest their cabin , a sewer pipe hangs over the woodworm-infested bunks , a mad sailor periodically has violent fits , and the Steward has the hots for Duncan ( a brief but funny appearance from Christopher Biggins ) . Fortunately , it turns out not to be the Begonia after all and as the episode ends , we see our heroes running across the docks , carrying a heavy-looking trunk between them . St . Swithins may have gone , but for the moment , it hardly matters . A classic episode .
401503	7743887	563030	10.0	" Twice an hour ? Twice a day ! "	Upton is called to the home of rich hypochondriac Mr . Medwin . Finding nothing wrong with him , he prescribes a tonic . No sooner has he returned to Dr . Whiteland's surgery than he receives a phone call informing him that Mr . Medwin has died . Medwin's family are a greedy , grasping bunch who cannot wait to get their hands on his fortune . As the will is read out , they receive a terrible shock - Mr . Medwin has bequeathed his money to his doctor . . . By ' Doctor ' standards , this is a dark episode indeed , with an elderly patient dying suddenly and Upton fearing being struck off for accidentally over prescribing medication ( the tonic contained strychnine ) . Even Dick briefly suspects Mike of ' bumping off ' Mr . Medwin . The studio audience don't sound very amused by the proceedings . Even so , its a welcome change of pace for the show . The late Jack May is well remembered as ' William E . Simms ' , the butler to Gerald Harper's ' Adam Adamant ' in the cult B . B . C . series of that name . John Nettleton was a regular in ' Yes Minister ' . Funniest moment - Upton's Bergmanesque nightmare . As Mike dashes about in slow motion across a mist covered landscape , he is menaced by the Medwin family amongst others , a sequence which pulls off the impressive feat of being both disturbing and funny .
