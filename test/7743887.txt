400918	7743887	198197	1.0	" Its Make Your Mind Up Time ! "	There has been renewed interest in Hughie Green recently thanks to a B . B . C . - 4 play called ' Most Sincerely ' starring Trevor Eve . The ex-'Shoestring ' actor gave a decent performance , if not quite capturing the sheer awfulness of the real Green . To say that I did not like him would be an understatement - the man raised verbal diarrhoea to an art form , and had an annoying habit of rolling his eyes , rather like ' Private Frazer ' from ' Dad's Army ' during one of his ' we're doomed ! ' monologues . Each week Hughie came on to the sound of Bob Sharples ' big band and in that sickly way of his introduced singers , comedians , magicians , novelty acts such as Tony Holland ( the musical muscle man ) , that bald guy who whacked himself on the head with a tray while singing ' Mule Train ' ( which caused untold headaches among British children when they tried to copy him ) and blokes who made plates spin on wooden sticks to the ' Pick Of The Pops ' theme . Then there was the legendary Brooks Aehron , who skilfully recreated Jerry Lewis ' ' Typewriter Song ' . It is easy to mock these individuals now , but there was a certain fascination to be had from them , like watching a dog chasing its own tail . Let us not forget that ' OpKnocks ' was responsible for creating a great many stars , among them Freddie Starr , Les Dawson , Lena Zavaroni , Little & Large , Mary Hopkin , Freddie ' Parrot Face ' Davies ( remember him ? ) , Peters & Lee , and Pam Ayres . You may or may not like these people , but the fact is they managed to have more enduring careers than those of the twerps thrown up by ' The X Factor ' and ' Pop Idol ' . Each act would be prefaced by a ' sponsor ' - a member of the public or sometimes a celebrity ( ' Emmerdale Farm ' actor Fraser Hines being one ) . From time to time these sponsors gave Hughie gifts . Bob Monkhouse was ordered to resign from ' The Golden Shot ' after being suspected of taking bribes , yet Hughie was doing it openly on air . Sometimes the acts had a familiar look about them . One was Adam Daye , an impressionist whose repertoire ran to Kenneth Williams and . . . er , that was it . Daye went on ' OpKnocks ' months after being seen in L . W . T . ' s quick fire comedy show ' Who Do You Do ? ' . Comedian Pat Tansey got nowhere on ' OpKnocks ' and went on its rival , A . T . V . ' s ' New Faces ' - which he won . But when a tabloid newspaper pointed out he had been on Hughie's show , the ' New Faces ' production team had no choice but to disqualify him . One element of ' OpKnocks ' I disliked were the child performers . As soon as you saw some freckle-faced kid dancing and singing Shirley Temple-style you knew he / she was going to win . Grannies and granddads would go " Ah , isn't he / she cute ? " , before writing to Hughie in their millions . One such performer was Stephen Smith , who banged drums while his Dad - Jimmy - played the organ . They originally appeared under the name ' Jimmy Smith & Son ' , but a week later - after the first of many wins - relaunched themselves as ' Stephen Smith & Father ' . Little Stephen's facial expressions whilst drumming suggested latent psychopathic tendencies . His favourite subject was his teeth . I used to wonder how a child could lose so many choppers in one week . It had to be that bigger boys were jealous of his success and were knocking them out with their fists . I knew how they felt . Another group of precocious youngsters were collectively known as ' The Weltons ' , whose speciality was performing the same song every week . I felt sorry for the adult acts unlucky enough to appear on the same shows - they needed their big breaks there and then , but did not get them because of sentimental old folks voting for these brats . At the close of each edition , the acts would be paraded for the viewers one final time as the legendary ' clap-o-meter ' - a device designed to measure audience applause , not sexually transmitted diseases - came into play . " Remember , folks ! " , said Hughie , " The clap-o-meter is just for fun ! " . But time marches on and eventually the powers-that-be ( Jeremy Isaacs and Philip Jones ) decided that Hughie should go . Not only was the show hopelessly outdated even in 1978 , but what did for him was his using it as a platform for his far-right political views . In fairness he only did it twice , but that was enough . Hughie politely asked the British public not to go on strike in future , before a choir struck up with ' Stand Up & Be Counted ' . All around the nation you could the collective sound of raspberries blown . Hughie's patriotism led him to do other bizarre things , such as televising ' OpKnocks ' from the British submarine base at Holy Loch , Scotland one week as a warning to the U . S . S . R . in case they were thinking of attacking Britain . Though Hughie reassured fans that he had no plans to retire , he was barely on the box after ' OpKnocks ' ended . A decade later , it was revived - by the B . B . C . - but without Hughie . They brought in Bob Monkhouse and later former winner Les Dawson to front the show . Hughie was given the courtesy credit of ' Consultant ' . Unsurprisingly , the new-look version was better than the old , even if it did give us Rosser & Davies . And I mean that most sincerely , folks .
401644	7743887	83458	1.0	The Simon Dee Of The ' 80's ?	' The Noel Edmonds Late Late Breakfast Show ' had a difficult birthing period ; the early shows began with a title sequence reminiscent of the old Simon Dee show ' Dee Time ' , depicting Noel racing to the B . B . C . T . V . Centre in various forms of transport . The late D . J . John Peel figured prominently , as did the Scottish comedian Leni Harper ( whatever happened to her ? ) . Poor ratings necessitated a rethink . Noel decided his co-presenters were to blame and , ditching them , brought in fellow D . J . Mike Smith . There was also a lawsuit threatened by Peter Dulay , ex-producer of the British version of ' Candid Camera ' . Dulay claimed that a ' Gotcha ' stunt involving a conveyor belt was a steal of one of his ideas . The case was letter settled out of court , with Dulay receiving a credit as ' Consultant ' . Despite these troubles , ' Late Late ' caught on with viewers , and would have run years had not viewer Michael Lush died whilst rehearsing a stunt . Noel later commented : " It nearly ruined my career . " . Didn't do Michael much good either , Noel .
401147	7743887	299309	1.0	" Hi ! I'm Roy ! " " And I'm Linda ! "	Thanks to those killjoys at H . T . V . Wales and their insane policy of regional scheduling ( English programmes everyone watched displaced by Welsh language shows no-one watched ) , I had to visit my auntie's house to see this show . Because she lived high on a hill , her set could pick up stations mine could not , such as Westward ( as it was then called ) . I watched once whilst chomping on a Birds Eye meat and onion pie , and afterwards suffered terrible indigestion . To this day , I'm not sure what caused it - the pie or the programme . ' Get It Together ' was the creation of Muriel Young , a former actor who'd become a producer of children's television programmes at Granada , where , amongst other things , she had masterminded the long-running film review show ' Clapperboard ' ( hosted by Chris Kelly ) , ' Shang-a-Lang ' which helped propel ' The Bay City Rollers ' to stardom , and ' Arrows ' ( remember their one and only hit - ' A Touch Too Much ' ? ) which didn't . ' Together ' was an attempt at a generic pop show , with groups miming to whatever they had in the charts at that time . None of the big hitters , such as ' Abba ' and ' The Bee Gees ' , were visible in the studio . Viewers had to make do instead with ' Brotherhood Of Man ' and ' The Jags ' ( I'm sure you've got got their C . D . ' s in your collection ) . Oh , and Sir Cliff Richard turned up at least once . As did ' Slade ' ! In 1977 , punk ruled and anarchy was in the air . ' The Sex Pistols ' was what the kids wanted . You would never have known it from ' Together ' , which boasted Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker murdering ' You're The One That I Want ' on a ferris wheel . Even now , I can remember how dated the show looked . The set was like the ' Dr . Who ' production team's idea of an alien city , with plastic walls , garish colours , and strobe lighting . I'm sure I even spotted dry ice lurking about the place . You half expected Tom Baker and K9 to appear . Nothing had moved on since ' Lift Off With Ayshea ' a few years earlier . Even the title - ' Get It Together ' - had a smell of patchouli oil about it . What was Young thinking ? The presenters were Linda Fletcher ( whatever happened to her ? ) and Roy North , newly divorced from ' Basil Brush ' . I have a soft spot for Roy ; after all , he was a pretty good straight man for The Foxy One and , if you think that does not sound like much of an achievement , just check out the presenters on Basil's current B . B . C . series . Roy and Linda opened each show by singing ( badly ) the ' Get It Together ' theme , which I have only managed to erase from my memory after years of psychiatric therapy and drugs . Roy , in flimsy disco shirt and flares , welcomed the audience by jumping up and down and exclaiming " Hi ! " in a pseudo-Presley manner . As well as the bands , there was a regular dance group known as ' Him & Us ' , consisting of a pair of stunning twins called Teri and Lisa Scoble ( who played clones in the classic children's sci-fi series ' Timeslip ' ) and a handsome bloke whose name I never found out . They gyrated nicely enough , often to backgrounds provided by a zoetrope . ' Him & Us ' originally appeared on ' Shang-a-Lang ' , then progressed to ' Arrows ' , before winding up here . By that time , they had acquired a new member , and changed their name to ' Him & Us Plus One ' . I often wondered why they didn't think to rename themselves ' Them & Us ' . Perhaps it sounded too much like an incitement to class warfare . The kids present were quizzed , with Roy shoving a stick microphone down their throats . Often they got the answers right but the researchers had messed up the questions . An exception was the lad who , after hearing Billy Ocean's ' Red Light Spells Danger ' was asked to identify the colour in the title of the song . He said : " Green " . The nadir of the show , though , came when Roy tried to sing a hit of the day . One week , it was David Soul's ' Don't Give Up On Us Baby ' and , believe me when I say Owen Wilson's version in the ' Starsky & Hutch ' movie was Pavarotti by comparison . As Roy enunciated each syllable his teeth made rumba movements . Whoever his dentist was , he should have gotten an award for his services to his craft . Throughout the song , kids in jumpers could be seen nervously edging their way off the set . A few years back , Granada Plus brought back ' Shang-a-Lang ' and ' Supersonic ' ( now there was a cool show ! ) , but strangely omitted ' Get It Together ' . No justice , is there ?
400675	7743887	931335	1.0	People In Glass Houses Shouldn't Throw Stones	I never thought I'd find myself feeling sorry for Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan , Tom Cruise , Kevin Federline , Heather Mills , Geri Halliwell , George Michael , Jamie Oliver et al . This programme listed 100 celebrities ( movie and pop stars , presenters , comedians , footballers , and politicians ) who have in some way or other teed off the nation in the last year . Except for me , because I do not read tacky tabloids , gossip magazines nor watch soap operas , sport or reality shows . What I found really annoying , however , were the presenters / showbiz journalists / comedians / gossip columnists presiding over this trial by television , amongst them Carole Malone , Kevin O'Sullivan , Gina Yashere , Ian Hyland and Polly Graham , all of whom were clucking like mother hens . You have never seen a more aggressive , rude and pompous bunch in your life . So what if Britney chooses not to wear panties when she goes nightclubbing ? Its a free world , isn't it ? ( Being a man , I must defend this habit ! ) Does it really matter whether or not Jade Goody has made a career out of being a simpleton ? Aren't there more urgent problems facing the world right now ? As someone who used to be a journalist ( albeit only for a local paper with a circulation confined to doctor's surgeries ) , I can safely say that your average news hound - male or female - drunk out of his / her mind is a more repellent sight than a rock star misbehaving at an awards show . One of my colleagues used to take delight in dropping her underwear whenever intoxicated . Another had a serious gambling addiction . They should be the last people on Earth to condemn others . Interestingly , the narrator was ex-'Blue Peter ' presenter Richard Bacon , himself no stranger to controversy . Besides , without Britney et al , how would they sell their rags ? Showbiz scandals are the lifeblood of tabloid journalism . They would be the first to complain if George Michael ' kept it in his pants ' and thus deprived them of good copy . The programme was little more than an excuse for a lot of untalented nobodies to vent their frustration on air at not being invited to more parties .
401388	7743887	317200	1.0	The British Tragedy Awards , More Like	I look forward to ' The British Comedy Awards ' each year because it provides me with an excellent excuse to go out for the evening . This annual jamboree has got it all ; talentless , big headed ' comedians ' winning awards despite their shows being absolute rubbish ; incoherent , rambling ' thank you ' speeches ; endless close-ups of grinning nobodies in tuxedos , obnoxious behaviour from Jonathan Ross ( his belittling of Rod Hull was inexcusable ) was and , of course , loads of swearing . Wa-hay , lads ! Why do these people still think swear words have any shock value left ? I wasn't offended by Julian Clary's ' fisting ' comment because it was mild compared to what you normally hear at this non-event . Worse , the occasion lends a veneer of respectability to the most appalling shows . Dare to venture a mildly derogatory comment about , say , ' Little Britain ' and you'll get the reply : " How come it won a ' Comedy Award ' then ? " . I would love to know the criteria used to pick the winners . It would seem that the awards are handed out on the basis of how much publicity the winner's private life has attracted . Which explains why Michael Barrymore was so successful for so long . And as for ' Mr . Blobby ' winning an award , well it speaks for itself , doesn't it ?
401496	7743887	327162	1.0	Easily The Worst And Most Unnecessary Remake Ever !	Its disturbing to note the number of classic ' 70's films that have had their reputations trashed by ' remakes ' - ' The Wicker Man ' , ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' The Omen ' , ' Assault On Precinct 13 ' and now this . Ira Levin's novel was not a laugh-out-loud comedy , and neither was Bryan Forbes ' 1975 movie , but this Frank Oz-directed film tries to be - and fails dismally . The screenplay adheres closely to the original story , but over-eggs the pudding with ' funny ' one-liners , and a ludicrous ' happy ' ending which makes the finale of the 1980 ' Revenge Of The Stepford Wives ' T . V . movie seem believable by comparison . The story was intended as a darkly humorous comment on the women's lib movement , as the male population of a small American town tries to reverse the tide of feminism by murdering their wives and replacing them with robot doubles , replicas both obedient and beautiful . But the tone of the original has been allowed to leak away ; this lumbering travesty has the look and feel of a 1960's sitcom . About the only thing missing is a laugh track . As for the performances , Nicole Kidman is so wooden that when she first appeared I thought she had already been ' replaced ' . Bette Midler , is as always , terrible . Glenn Close , Christopher Walken and Matthew Broderick could have phoned in their performances . The exact nature of the duplications is confused - are the women being replaced by robots , or simply brainwashed ? For most of the picture , it appears to be the former , but when Broderick shuts down the control centre at the climax , the wives regain their personalities , suggesting the latter . What a cop-out . I have heard complaints that the 1975 movie was ' cheesy ' . Well , let me put the record straight . Fashions , hairstyles , technology etc . may have changed dramatically since the 70's , but the fact remains that Bryan Forbes ' movie is a far better picture than this one . William Goldman's script did not insult the intelligence of the audience , and Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss outclass Kidman and Midler . On the cheeseometer , the remake registers as pure Stilton . I wonder which sci-fi classic will be next in line for the same treatment . John Frankenheimer's ' Seconds ' ? Will the remake end with ' Tony Wilson ' ( the Rock Hudson character in the original ) cracking lame gags as a Company doctor drills his skull ?
401610	7743887	217211	1.0	Loose Teeth !	I have a theory as to why ' Loose Women ' exists . The Government have been making a lot of noise recently about how disabled people should be made to look for work . ' Loose ' is obviously intended to get the ' slackers ' out of their wheelchairs and into the Job Centres . It is so stupid and mind-numbingly boring as to defy description . Its a simple recipe : take four middle-aged has-beens ( one a failed soap actress , one an over-the-hill pop singer , one whose only claim to fame is that her husband ditched her as soon as he got famous , and one of whom I've never heard ) , give them a glass of gin each , and put them on air . As one would expect , the main topic of conversation is sex . If none of these women were famous , odds are they'd be hard pressed to get any . Every time the word ' sex ' is mentioned , the studio audience - mostly made up of hysterical grandmothers - goes into hyper drive . The guests consist mainly of thespians plugging their latest film / play / T . V . show . But the highlight of each show is a phone-in quiz which taxes the viewer's intellect with such difficult questions as ' In which street is ' Coronation Street ' set ? ' . Kaye is bossy , Colleen bland , Sherrie ( when she's there ) is loud , as is Denise , and Carol can't utter a sentence without blaming The Government for something or other . They tried Lesley Garrett on the show , without much success . She was too much of a lady to fit in with this dreary bunch . One final thought : we live in an age of so-called ' sexual equality ' , so why isn't there a show called ' Loose Men ' ?
401278	7743887	358856	1.0	Little Things Please Little Minds	No other show epitomises the decline of television comedy more than ' Little Britain ' . Its telling that its main audience are kids , the sort easily amused by swearing , vomiting and farting . If it keeps the little dears happy , that's fine by me . What I find odd though is how the nation seems to have clasped it to its collective bosom , almost as though its the best thing to happen to British comedy since Mrs . Chaplin gave birth to Charlie . Even ' The South Bank Show ' devoted an edition to it . What the hell is going on ? ' Little Britain ' is the creation of David Walliams and Matt Lucas , a double act who made Dailey & Wayne ( never heard of them ? I'm not surprised ! ) look good . Its main targets are the obese , incontinent and elderly . The contempt Lucas and Walliams has for these unfortunates has to be seen to be believed . Hitler would have adored this show . Lucas once did an advert for Cadbury's creme eggs in which his head spun round . It remains the highpoint of his career to date . ' I'm the only gay in this village ' wasn't funny the first time he said it . It must rank as the most banal comic catchphrase of all time . Why are this appalling pair allowed to make fun of black people when old shows like ' Curry & Chips ' and ' Love Thy Neighbour ' dare not be repeated for fear of giving offence ? What Tom Baker is doing associated with this swill is a mystery . I look forward to 2200 A . D . when ' Little Britain ' is mercilessly ridiculed by a ' Time Trumpet ' style show . In the meantime , give this abomination a wide berth .
401258	7743887	80250	2.0	The Nesbitts Came & Went !	Firstly , let me state for the record that ' The Nesbitts Are Coming ' has no connection whatever with ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' ( wasn't the 2008 Christmas Special hilarious , by the way ? ) . Rab made his debut on BBC-2's ' Naked Video ' a good six years after this Yorkshire T . V . series ended . It was written by Dick Sharples , responsible for the charming undertaker sitcom ' In Loving Memory ' with Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny . It had a good cast including Clive Swift ( ' Richard ' of ' Keeping Up Appearances ' ) , Maggie Jones ( ' Blanche ' from ' Coronation Street ' ) , Deirdre Costello ( ' Linda Preston ' from ' I Didn't Know You Cared ' ) , Ken Jones ( ' Ives ' from ' Porridge ' ) , and the always reliable Tony Melody and Patsy Rowlands . The Nesbitts were what might today be termed a problem family ; they roamed the North-East in an open-topped van , terrorising communities either by conning or stealing from them . Had Asbos existed then , they would have been a dead cert to get them . Swift was ' Ernie ' , the perpetually coughing father who rarely spoke except make requests to be taken to the loo . Jones was his loud wife , about whom a policeman once remarked : " if she wasn't Northern , I'd swear she was Sicillian ' . John Price's ' Len ' was like ' Tucker ' from ' Citizen Smith ' in that he dressed at all times like a cowboy . Costello's ' Marlene ' threw herself at anything in trousers , while ' Tom ' ( Christian Rodska ) was a dead ringer for ' Vyvian ' from ' The Young Ones ' . Their arch-nemesis was the incompetent ' Det . Sgt . Arnold Nixon ' ( Ken Jones ) who wanted nothing more than to see this scurrilous gang put behind bars for good . To this end , he assigned W . P . C . Kitty Naylor ( Patsy Rowlands ) to go undercover , and pretend to fall in love with Len to find out what the family were up to . The problem was that she really had fallen in love , and was torn between her personal feelings and duties as a policewoman . . . ' The Nesbitts ' had originally appeared in a May 1967 episode of the B . B . C . ' s crime drama ' Z-Cars ' , entitled ' ' The Nesbitts Are Back ' . Hylda Baker played ' Mrs . Nesbitt ' , with a young Lynda La Plante as ' Marlene ' ! But the family's move into comedy was ill-advised - they proved about as funny as typhoid . For reasons best known to himself , Sharples had the characters burst into song every now and then , causing the comedy to grind to a halt . Songs such as the slushy ' I'm Not Getting My Share Of Life ' , sung by Patsy Rowlands . Its chorus went as follows : " I'm not getting my share / of living , loving , its not fair / I'm not getting my share of life . " . It was like watching a third-rate West End musical . The show was not getting its share of viewers either . Most were put-off by the intrusive music . As far as I know , only ' The Mighty Boosh ' has done anything similar recently , and that should give you some idea how truly bad it was .
401445	7743887	85076	2.0	" I Could Be The Real Me ! "	Its difficult to see how this show could have failed . It was based on the B . B . C . ' s ' The Fall & Rise Of Reginald Perrin ' , and starred the brilliant Richard Mulligan ( ' Burt Campbell ' of ' Soap ' ) as rebellious commuter Reggie Potter . The scripts closely followed the David Nobbs originals , so what went wrong ? Perhaps it was the fact that there was never a given starting point for Reggie's madness . The first episode of the B . B . C . version opened with a normal day in Reggie's life . Then he asks Elisabeth , his wife : " Are we going to see the hippotamus on Sunday ? " . Here Potter starts out crazy , we never see just what he is rebelling against , hence the viewers had no sympathy for him . Some of the supporting cast were badly chosen , particularly ' C . J . ' , here played by a young , good-looking guy . Another mistake was making Reggie's layabout son Mark into a regular . He appeared only briefly in the B . B . C . series . The horrible song used to open the show didn't help matters either . ' Reggie ' was an unqualified disaster . Fortunately , we have the original to remind us what a great comedy show is supposed to look like .
401402	7743887	591053	2.0	That Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady	Appalled by Tim and Graeme's boorish displays of sexism , Bill summons ' Women's Libber ' Barbara . To show them what women have to endure , she puts them to work for her father - a chauvinistic aristocrat who treats women like dirt . Graeme has an easy life as the butler , but poor Tim is put through hell as the maid . He emerges a better man for the experience . In the meantime , Bill gets engaged to Barbara , whilst Graeme begins dating . . . wait for it . . . his computer ! The longer run of season 2 resulted in several episodes which should not have been made , and this is one of them . Its ammunition for those smug critics who claim ' 70's comedy is hopelessly sexist . It begins as it means to go on with Tim being horrid to his date , Debbie . There's some good gags later on as Tim is treated appallingly by Barbara's father , and Graeme romping through the woods in slow motion with his computer , but the whole thing collapses at the end . Pretending to be a feminist protester , Tim shows up at the church where Bill and Graeme are to be married , and persuades his friends to abandon their wedding plans . Bill casually dumping Barbara got no laugh from the audience - nor from me . If the intention was to ridicule male chauvinistic attitudes , it failed because Garden and Oddie make fun of the alternative too . They were to repeat this blunder in their equally reprehensible ' Doctor In Charge ' episode ' The Black & White Medical Show ' . Chalk this down as an interesting failure . Funniest moment - the spoof advertisement for ' Honest Holidays ' which looks like the inspiration for ' Carry On Abroad ' !
400998	7743887	72557	5.0	Did You Hear The One About . . .	. . . the Englishman , the Scotsman , the Irishman , and the Welshman ? Vince Powell obviously did , because that was the premise of this short-lived Thames sitcom . Having co-created popular shows such as ' George & The Dragon ' , ' Two In Clover ' ( what a little gem that was ! ) , ' For The Love Of Ada ' , ' Never Mind The Quality Feel The Width ' and ' Love Thy Neighbour ' with his late partner Harry Driver , Powell was on the look out for another hit . Early in 1975 , he gave us ' The Wackers ' with Ken Jones ( ' Horrible Ives ' from ' Porridge ' ) as a Scouser trying to readjust to society following a stretch in prison . It drew complaints on account of its colourful ( though mild by today's standards ) language and was swiftly axed . Vince bounced back that year with ' My Son Reuben ' , starring the late Bernard Spear as a mother-dominated Jewish launderette owner . It too failed to find an audience . Around the same time that last show went out , Vince unveiled ' Rule Britannia ! ' in which four old ex-Royal Navy sailors honoured a pact by meeting up again after 25 years . They were ' George Bradshaw ' ( Tony Melody ) , whose zest for life seems to have deserted him , ' Jock McGregor ' ( the late and much-missed Russell Hunter ) , ' Paddy O'Brien ' ( the late Joe Lynch , who had appeared in Powell and Driver's earlier ' Never Mind The Quality etc . ) , and ' Taffy Evans ' ( Richard Davies a . k . a . ' Mr . Price ' from ' Please Sir ! ' ) . Carol Mills played busty barmaid ( didn't all ' 70's sitcoms have these ? ) ' Maggie ' . Back in the company of his old chums again , George regains his sense of humour . But wife Lil ( Jo Warne , from Powell's ' Spring & Autumn ' ) is not amused seeing her husband in such disreputable company . With this top notch cast , it should have been a huge hit . Yes , the four main characters were stereotypes , but lots of classic sitcoms have featured these so I do not really have a problem with that . What I objected to was that Powell never really did much with them . Most of the time they sat around drinking beer , arguing about which part of the U . K . was best , and reminiscing about the ' good old days ' . The opening titles showed four pints of beer mysteriously disappearing to the stains of ( what else ? ) ' Rule Britannia ' . Viewers quickly tired of the whole thing . In one episode , George , Jock and Taffy put on a talent show to raise money for Paddy to go back to Ireland and see his mother . They did this , only for the show organiser to rob them as soon as their backs were turned . However , an alternative solution was found , and the episode ended happily as a tearful O'Brien was reunited with his mother . ' Rule Britannia ! ' was no classic , yet was worth watching for the cast , especially the dour tam o'shanter wearing Hunter . There was a very funny scene in another episode when the fellers discussed soap operas . " The wife's mother thinks ' The Archers ' ( a long-running B . B . C . radio soap about country folk ) are all real people ! " , said a grinning George . " She once tried to book a fortnight's holiday in Ambridge ! " .
401436	7743887	563124	5.0	" Come on England ! "	Duncan , Dick and Andy are looking forward to a Saturday afternoon in front of the telly , watching a football game between England and Wales . So keen is he to see the English hammered the Scottish Andy is kitted out in Welsh national costume . But Duncan is unexpectedly recalled to duty . To spoil his friends ' fun , he tells Gascoigne that an old Busby Berkeley musical is on B . B . C . - 2 . Gascoigne is almost assaulted when he tries to change the channel . Loftus shows up , and the film is put back on . Dick pulls the plug out of the wall , and makes it appear as though the set has broken down . Just as they are getting into the game , two T . V . repair men take the set away , claiming they are part of a faulty batch . . . I remember reading an article in ' The Sunday People ' ( as it was then called ) in 1977 , which credited ex-doctors turned comedy writers Rob Buckman and Chris Beetles with having ' saved ' the ' Doctor ' series . This made no sense ( it was not renewed after this season ) , as their episodes are nowhere near as funny ( in my view ) as those of Steve Thorn and Paul Wolfson . This one is like the ' No Peace For The Wicked ' episode of ' Porridge ' in that the main character ( s ) is looking forward to a planned Saturday afternoon , only to be continually interrupted at every opportunity . But the two are worlds apart in terms of execution . To get revenge on Gascoigne for his continual interruptions , the lads trick him into thinking that an Italian patient ( played by Ricardo Montez of ' Mind Your Language ' fame ) has a mysterious unknown disease . Oh ha-ha . Funniest moment - the bit at the end where Gascoigne gets revenge on his tormentors by magnanimously sending them a television set to watch the match . However , it has no screen , valves or tubes , just a football dangling on a piece of string inside the box !
400999	7743887	505216	6.0	Tunnel To Nowhere	A man is knifed to death in a London sewer . Then during a power blackout , Georgina witnesses a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller's , a crime for which she is arrested . Beneath London's streets , criminals gather to listen as The Face outlines his plan for ' The Crime Of The Century ' - he intends staging a massive power blackout , so that his men can emerge from hiding and steal everything they can get their hands on , including the Crown Jewels ! Gasp ! A number of top British comedy writers contributed to this show , amongst them Vince Powell , Harry Driver , Dick Sharples , and Richard Waring . Presumably it was thought that these gentlemen's ability to concoct amusing , original situations would make them ideally suited to a show of this kind , which after all was pretty outrageous . Waring was known at that time as the creator of the hit show ' Marriage Lines ' which starred Richard Briers and Prunella Scales , and would later write ' Not In Front Of The Children ' for Wendy Craig , and ' Rings On Their Fingers ' for Martin Jarvis and Diane Keen . ' Tunnel ' is nothing if not audacious ; the ' blackout ' idea was clearly inspired by the famous one in America two years before . Why oh why does The Face deliberately endanger his own plan by involving Adamant ? Its almost as though he wants to be thwarted . The ending is a bit of an anti-climax - Georgina rescues Adam and Simms from a perilous situation , Adam pulls a lever and . . . that's it . End of story . Kenneth Ives , who plays ' Bruno ' , would later direct episodes of the classic B . B . C . show ' Secret Army ' .
401487	7743887	195463	6.0	Archery On Television	A few years back , Sky's ' Challenge T . V . ' repeated editions of ' The Golden Shot ' as part of a season of archive game shows ( how about another season , Challenge ? Hint . hint . ) . I watched in fascination ( as you do ) when confronted by a show one had not seen in literally years . ' Shot ' was a fixture on Sunday afternoon television for years , but began life as a peak-time Saturday night show . Hosted by Jackie Rae , a genial Canadian , it was okay but nothing special . Blindfolded contestants aimed a William Tell-style crossbow at a target while directed by another member of the public via telephone . The bows were loaded by ' Bernie The Bolt ' ( who was always called that , no matter his real name ) . The ritual went something like : " up a bit , left a bit , down a bit . . . fire ! " . Whosoever hit the target ( or got closest to it ) won a cash prize . The targets changed from game to game ( one week , they had a special show to tie-in with the children's sci-fi show ' Captain Scarlet & The Mysterons ' with the hostesses dressed as Spectrum Angels ) . At the end of each show , the target was a golden apple , and if hit a cascade of glitter poured forth , drawing gasps from the studio audience . ' Shot ' was moved to Sundays by Lord Lew Grade , and Rae replaced by the marvellous Bob Monkhouse . Both decisions proved correct . Rae had been humourless and stiff , but Bob had this amazing ability to improvise ( and needed it for the show went out live ) . He often told on chat-shows years later how a man insisted on taking part even though his T . V . set had been repossessed by Rumbelow's , and the only way he could view the show was through the window of a T . V . shop in the High Street . Charming though this story is , one must take it with a pinch of salt - T . V . shops would not have been open in those days on Sundays . The other well-remembered participant was Anne Aston , cute , blonde and daffy ( a sort of Carol Vorderman without the mathematics ) . Monkhouse made the show a hit , but left somewhat suddenly in 1973 . In his autobiography , he later revealed that A . T . V . suspected him of taking bribes from contestants . It was untrue , of course . Bob was replaced by ex-'Sunday Night At The London Palladium ' host Norman Vaughan . I have to say I never found the man the least bit funny , and his stint on ' Shot ' was dire . He never stopped talking , once telling a lengthy joke only for the the punchline to be met with complete silence . Norman's replacement , Charlie Williams , was even worse . The first black comic to make it big in Britain , the Yorkshireman became a sensation on Granada's ' The Comedians ' , and was in great demand for television , theatre , advertising etc . He was even the subject of a strip in the children's comic ' Shiver & Shake ' . Williams later described his run on ' Shot ' as ' the biggest mistake of my career ' . He was right . Watching one of his editions again recently I felt genuinely sorry for him . He was just not cut out to be a game-show host , and came off looking like chief mourner at a funeral . When the show ended , his television career ended with it . In 1975 , the I . B . A . ( Independent Broadcasting Authority ) ruled that ' Shot ' had run its course , and took it off . Monkhouse came back for the final edition , along with Norman . ' Shot ' was briefly revived a while back by Ant & Dec , but as I never saw it ( nothing on Earth would want to make me watch those two ) , I cannot comment . The old Sunday teatime game show slot was later ( more than adequately ) filled by Jim Bowen's ' Bullseye ' , ironically co-created by Norman Vaughan , and it remains his best known achievement . Having made up with Monkhouse , A . T . V . eventually gave him a new game show - ' Family Fortunes ' . For those of us of a certain age , we cannot consume a Spam sandwich nor mandarin oranges with Carnation ( its nice - try it some time ! ) without remembering this show , and some poor twit going : " Down a bit , right a bit , up a bit . . . fire ! " .
401327	7743887	162089	6.0	" Very well , thank you ! "	Lovable , bumbling Harry Worth is barely remembered now , yet in the ' 60's and ' 70's he was one of British television's brightest comedy stars . With his trademark trilby and spectacles , he was a walking disaster area . This Yorkshire T . V . sitcom cast him as Harry Matthews , a middle-aged widower struggling to raise two children - the good-looking Martin , and Shirley , a precocious schoolgirl . It was not easy . As Harry sang each week : " She's growing up so incredibly fast , he seems to think I live in the past ' . It was basically ' Father Dear Father ' by another name , even the title was the same as a Michael Robbins I . T . V . sitcom from 1975 . In the first episode , Harry is concerned at the prospect of Martin dating an older woman . A later ( and rather funny ) instalment saw Shirley announce her wedding to a drippy mummy's boy . Fanny Carby played a nosey next-door neighbour ( as she seemed to do in most I . T . V . sitcoms of the period ) . Harry for the most part was in fine form , although a little unsteady in some scenes ( absentmindedly referring to Shirley as Debby in one episode ) . It was cosy domestic sitcom fare - the sets were cardboard , the plots contrived , the characters too nice to be credible - far removed from the awfulness of the real world . Maybe that was why it was so enjoyable .
401518	7743887	591020	6.0	Metal Billy !	The Goodies are losing money , so they downsize by cutting a third of their work force - in other words , they fire Bill . To replace the bearded bird watcher , Graeme builds a robot - a walking dustbin with Nookie Bear-eyes that behaves like a baby . They hire ( where did they suddenly get the money from ? ) a Swedish au pair named Helga who turns out to be Bill in drag . Bill tries to destroy the robot , but it proves too clever for him . Soon it has grown ( ! ) to the size of a man and begins having sex with other robots . Determined to put a stop to it , Graeme dresses as a female robot . The android isn't fooled and enlists the aid of a cooker , a toaster and a vacuum cleaner in a bid to take over the business . . . Following the ' Snow White 2 ' Special , this was the first ' proper ' episode of ' The Goodies ' to be screened on I . T . V . Its hardly one of the team's more inspired efforts . To be honest , its one of their worst , bearing an unfortunate resemblance to L . W . T . ' s ' Metal Mickey ' children's comedy series , which starred Irene Handl . Besides , they had a robot servant in the B . B . C . episode ' U-Friend or U-Foe ' ( it was called HEE-BEE-GEE-BEE ) , and had previously done a plot about Bill leaving the business ( ' Cunning Stunts ' ) , so there was something of a ' been there , done that ' feel to the whole thing . The ' robot as baby ' angle became tiresome well before the commercial break ( and what a shock it was in 1982 to see genuine commercials in ' The Goodies ' instead of spoof ones ) . The voice of the robot was provided by the late David Rappaport , best remembered as one of the dwarfs in Terry Gilliam's ' Time Bandits ' . Funniest moment - Holding aloft a placard that reads ' Support Your Striking Mate ' , Bill pickets the Goodies offices . It rains and the ink runs , so that the placard now reads : ' Up Yours , Mate ' . A passer-by sees this and punches Bill out !
401607	7743887	675792	6.0	Special Schoolkids Issue !	Suspecting shopkeeper Mr . Dutton of selling cigarettes to the Fenn Street pupils , Mr . Cromwell declares the shop out of bounds . This not only riles the kids , but also Smithy , who buys his aniseed balls there regularly . To get revenge , 4C launches a new version of the school magazine - ' The Fenntasy ' . Filled with provocative articles and obscene photos ( including a ' Classmate Of The Term ' ) , it shocks the teachers so much they try to suppress it . . . With John Alderton gone , Deryck Guyler was effectively the show's new star . This was the first ' Please Sir ! ' not to be written by Esmonde and Larbey . The writers are Geoff Rowley and Andy Baker , authors of several ' Fenn Street Gang ' episodes . Basically a reworking of ' X Certificate ' from Season 2 , only here the pupils are making a magazine rather than a film . The allusions to the famous ' Oz ' obscenity trial are unmistakable . 4C are given a bit more screen time than in ' Identitwit ' and its easy to see why Hedges disliked them so much that he left . Not a decent actor amongst them . Still , they least they look like children , which was more one could have said about 5C . Funniest moment - an angry Mr . Dutton confronting the headmaster in a corridor , and Potter turning chicken when threatened ( shades of Frankie Abbott ! )
401336	7743887	635129	7.0	Lost In The Dark Dimension !	Chased by Sandmen , Logan - with Rem's help - penetrates a force-field surrounding a bunker-like structure set into a hill . Logan deactivates the minefield beyond , making it safe for them to enter . They find an underground complex , in which lives the beautiful Lisa , with two comical-looking robots - Friend and Nanny - for company . While Francis fumes outside , Lisa falls for Logan , and comes to see Jessica as a threat to her happiness . Lisa has been imprisoned because she was perceived as a threat to Mankind - she has phenomenal psychic powers . . . A variant on ' Forbidden Planet ' . Lisa Eilbacher plays the naive young woman ; first seen in Shirley Temple pigtails , she then dresses provocatively to attract Logan's eye . Hard to tell but for a moment I thought she had the hots for Jessica too . Were this to be made now , the limitless erotic possibilities could certainly be exploited . ' Friend ' looks like one of the Cylons from the original ' Battlestar Galactica ' , then a year away . Not bad , but ending's a letdown , though .
400932	7743887	108771	7.0	Too Much Filler	' The Fast Show ' is ' Harry Enfield's Television Programme ' without Harry Enfield . No offence to Paul Whitehouse and co . , but they are hardly in Enfield's league when it comes to comic characters . So whilst funny at times ( the lovely ' Ralph and Ted ' sketches , the ' Ground Force ' send-up , the spoof of 70's British film comedies ) at others its the proverbial pain in the butt . Enfield's show used catchphrases too , but they weren't the focal point of the comedy . The early ' Monty Python ' shows had visual catchphrases like the knight with the chicken , the angry Colonel etc . , they were later dropped when the Pythons realised they were a cheap way of getting a laugh . ' The Fast Show ' , on the other hand , is full of the most banal comic catchphrases ever devised . When Arabella Weir complained to the producer about the use of naked breasts in one scene , she was told : " We're being postmodern ironic ! " . Which is a novel way of saying " We can get away with being un-P . C . , because we're clever ! " . Sorry , Charlie , but I won't fall for it . Whenever I watch repeats of ' Fast ' I always tape them first so I can fast-forward through the filler to get to the good stuff .
401541	7743887	61179	7.0	" I'll be blowed ! "	British scientists have developed a new means of aircraft propulsion - a nuclear unit protected by a lightweight metal known as ' Spurium ' . A gang of villains , headed by Angel and Cherub , want to steal a sample to sell to the Russians . But Charles Vine is not about to let them . . . The second entry in the Charles Vine spy series , played mainly for laughs to try and compensate for a low budget . Adams is his usual laconic self , but Michael Pittock's script lacks the twists and turns of the first movie's screenplay . The late Michael Ripper was not cut out to play Bondian villains , ditto Tim Barrett , cast as the bowler-hatted assassin ' Seraph ' . Though given equal billing with Tom Adams , Dawn Addams is only on screen for the last twenty minutes . Cameos from Sid James as a mortician , Joe Baker as a Cabinet Minister and Wilfred Brambell as a train station guard destroy any hope the film has of being taken seriously . Lindsay Shonteff , director of the first Vine picture , was replaced by John Gilling who seems to know nothing of how to make an action movie . However , there's a good prologue in which Vine - in drag - helps thwart a rocket attack on The Houses Of Parliament . Best among the supporting cast is John Arnatt , back as Vine's harassed boss Rockwell . Some aspects of the plot are somewhat confusing . For instance , when Vine and Seraph leave Rockwell's office , they are photographed by a Chinese woman . She is not seen nor mentioned again . Who is she ? One good gag : getting into a taxi , Vine says " Waterloo ! " . The driver looks baffled . " The station ? " . " Bit late for the battle ! " , quips the secret agent . A few more funny bits like this , and the film might have been worth watching .
400718	7743887	665462	7.0	" This is worse than trying to shoe a horse ! "	Its nearly time for the annual Busman's Ball . This year , instead of a conjurer , the lads want a stripper , and have one in mind , the delectable Sandra . Blakey rejects the idea , but relents when Jack informs him that unless Sandra gets to strut her stuff , the busmen will boycott the ball . Arthur announces he will not attend , but changes his mind when he finds out that Sandra will be appearing . Stan and Arthur collaborate to fix Olive's dress in time for the ball . Needless to say , it is not an easy job , and involves the use of a dressmaker's dummy which is in no way shaped like Olive . . . It was inevitable that the lovely Wendy Richard would turn up in ' On The Buses ' at some point . Before she became a human cannonball , before she became ' Miss Brahms ' of ' Are You Being Served ? ' , she was clippie Elsie . Its not much of a role , frankly , and is not pivotal to the story . An actress of her calibre deserved better . The episode gets off to a good start with Stan and Jack holding Blakey to ransom , but gets sidetracked with the hoo-haa over Olive's dress , and becomes a little tiresome . Still , there's some fun to be had over Stan's attempts to slip a girdle on the dressmaker's dummy . Funniest moment - Olive emerging tearful from the Ball . After the stripper's knickers landed in her lap , the busmen piled on top of her to get it ! ( The lucky bloke with the garment has to take it back to Sandra . No wonder Stan and Jack were so keen to book her ! ) . Stan is the man on this occasion , making this probably the only ' On The Buses ' episode to end with him getting the girl !
401324	7743887	62657	7.0	Fun in Acapulco With Dino	I . C . E . are brought in to supervise security on the launching of an experimental spacecraft , which resembles a flying saucer . The pilot is glamorous Sheila Sommers . No sooner is the craft in flight than an anti-gravity beam pulls it back to Earth . The thief is one Jose Ortega , owner of a beer factory in Acapulco , and also the leader of a group of fanatical would-be revolutionaries out to overthrow the Government of Mexico . Sheila is found in the jungle some time later , badly beaten and with no memory of her ordeal . To recuperate , she is sent to an ICE rehabilitation centre by MacDonald . Also present ( on a refresher course ) is Matt Helm . . . The third picture in the series , ' The Ambushers ' was also the second and last to be scripted by Herbert Baker and directed by Henry Levin . Once again Donald Hamilton's storyline has been clumsily grafted onto a jokey , sci-fi oriented plot . ' Murderers ' Row ' featured a death-ray , here its a flying saucer ( doubtless had Baker written ' The Wrecking Crew ' , time travel would have figured ) . What's surprising is how much fun the movie is . A big improvement over its predecessor , the locations are beautifully photographed and it breezes along nicely with plenty of action and good humour . Albert Salmi is menacing as the villain , and Janice Rule makes a classy heroine as Sheila . Senta Berger sizzles as the top pilot for ' BIG O ' - Francesca Medeiros . Yes , the Slaygirls are on hand again to assist Matt , some kitted out with guns in their brassieres . At times you feel that there's a good movie struggling to get out . A stronger emphasis on adventure and less on comedy was needed . Better S . F . X . would have helped too . The saucer and Ortega's anti-gravity devices ( where did he get these , incidentally ? ) look like left-over props from ' Star Trek ' . As Matt , Dino is . . . well , Dino . If you don't like Dino , don't watch Matt Helm . For all its failings , this is the best Helm movie since ' The Silencers ' .
400607	7743887	959715	7.0	" The Basil Fawlty Of St . Swithins ! "	Duncan is undergoing a mid-life crisis which takes the form of bursts of uncontrollable rage . Everything seems to upset him , from coffee machines that do not work to hermetically sealed sandwiches . He even loses his temper with one of his patients , a young boy . Concerned for his well being , Dick suggests he sees a psychiatrist . Luckily , Duncan is married to one . It becomes clear Duncan is jealous of Collier's success . Dick suggests he goes into the private sector too . Paul leaves him in charge of his patients for a day to see what it is like . Unfortunately , his first is the same boy he shouted at in St . Swithins . . . The last episode of ' At The Top ' was by Bill Oddie and , while not as good as his others , was better than those at the start of the series . Funniest moment - Snell trying to calm Duncan by giving him coffee , only to get it thrown in his face ! The big audience for ' Sins Of The Father ' did not stick around . First impressions count and its particularly true of sitcoms . Unless viewers bust a gut laughing at the first episode , they do not tune in again . Which means they would have been unaware of the upswing in quality which occurred with the fourth episode . A similar upswing took place in the first series of ' In The House ' in 1969 . In those days , each season had a longer run ( usually thirteen episodes ) meaning viewers had time to get to like the characters . In ' At The Top ' , what few viewers remained had just gotten accustomed to the new-look St . Swithins , when it was axed . There's no use in denying it was a ratings failure . For all its faults , though , it was superior to other revived sitcoms of that era , such as ' The Liver Birds ' and ' Agony Again ' . It deserved a second season , preferably with new writers aboard . When Layton was the subject of a ' This Is Your Life ' later in the decade , Oddie came on as a guest , and made light of the failure of ' At The Top ' . Apart from a solitary repeat on U . K . Gold in the mid-90's , it has not been seen since . If nothing else , it gave an extra dimension to the characters , reminding us that youth is something we only have once and ought to cherish while it lasts . Five years after ' At The Top ' , the St . Swithins ' gang were back on British T . V . screens , courtesy of the then-new satellite channel ' Granada Plus ' . A whole new generation was able to enjoy a complete run of the L . W . T . ' Doctor ' series , commencing ( rather oddly ) with the second season of ' In Charge ' . ' Men & Motors ' recently repeated both seasons of ' In The House ' and it is out on D . V . D . There seems little chance of it being forgotten . Reviewing all these episodes has left me exhausted , and in need of a nice , soothing massage . Wonder if Nurse Willett is available ?
401579	7743887	516846	7.0	' The Great Great Britain Crime '	' Homicide & Old Lace ' is regarded by ' Avengers ' buffs as the show's worst ever episode . I disagree . Season Five's ' The Joker ' ( a lame remake of the vastly superior ' Don't Look Behind You ' ) beats it hands down for sheer awfulness . Even so , it is a bit if a dog's breakfast . When John Bryce was fired as producer , Albert Fennell and Brian Clemens were asked to return . They filmed new scenes for the episodes already in the can , with only ' Invasion Of The Earthmen ' going out relatively intact . ' The Great Great Britain Crime ' was not so lucky . Clemens apparently disliked it so much he felt the only way he could possibly include it was to turn it into a comedy , hence the framing device of Mother spinning a tall tale to his dotty spinster aunts ( Mary Merrill and Joyce Carey ) . What ultimately resulted was an ' Avengers ' version of ' Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ' and you cannot get much worse than that . We can see where the faults are , and do not need for anyone to point them out to us . The plot itself is a sequel to ' Intercrime ' , an episode of the second season , written by Malcolm Hulke and Terrance Dicks . The dastardly criminal organisation is up to its old tricks again , this time plotting to trigger ' Operation : Rule Britannia ' , a plan to remove all art treasures from galleries in the event of war , replace them with forgeries , and give the originals for safe-keeping to Colonel Corf ( Gerald Harper ) . Once he places them in his secure vault , Intercrime can then nab them . The ' Great Great Britain Crime ' sequences were directed by Vernon Sewell , but the director's credit goes to John Hough . The problem is that the framing material is obtrusive and leadenly unfunny , despite artful playing from Newell , Merall and Carey . There's no Tara , and Steed only appears in a toe-curling tag scene in which Rhonda ( Mother's mute bodyguard ) is made to speak for the first time . Left intact , this would in my view have been a lot more interesting . Certainly it boasts a couple of decent action bits , such as Tara being chased around a multi-storey car park by hoods and the final shoot-out in Corf's vault . Another mistake on Clemens ' part was the re-use of old footage , such as Steed nearly being buried alive in ' The Fear Merchants ' and being attacked by Christopher Lee in ' Never Never Say Die ' . Sadly , the original version is widely believed to no longer exist , meaning we are stuck with this travesty for all eternity . The final insult is Laurie Johnson's tinkly piano score . It more or less tells the audience : " this is rubbish and we know it ! " . So its for the revisions , for the original material .
401468	7743887	494607	7.0	A Shotgun Wedding	When Morecambe and Wise left the B . B . C . in 1978 to go to Thames , the B . B . C . looked around for a brand new double-act to replace them . Producer Ernest Maxin took two comedians who had enjoyed limited television exposure , Lennie Bennett and Jerry Stevens , and gave them their own show . Bennett , curly-headed and with big teeth , was the funny one , while Jerry , good-looking and Italianesque , played at being straight man . The show itself was a curate's egg , to be honest , often looking like televised cabaret , but the duo caught the public's fancy , and soon they were doing Royal Variety Performances and the like , their patter often interrupted by toothless northerner Albert Pontefract . Had Lennie and Jerry stayed together its very likely they'd have inherited Eric and Ernie's crown ( their only competition at this time were Little & Large , and Cannon & Ball ) ; even Eric Morecambe admitted to being a fan , but in 1980 they stunned fans by splitting up . Lennie went on to host the I . T . V . game show ' Punchlines ' , Jerry the B . B . C . ' s short-lived ' Telly Quiz ' . When those ended , obscurity beckoned for both comics .

However , Duffy's van is stolen by the students . Eric is furious with Frankie as he'd left him in charge of the vehicle . To make matters worse , the van contained a box in which is a wedding dress intended for Duffy's cousin Deborah . As the clock ticks down to the ceremony , Eric must find the van and retrieve the garment . . . A Rowley / Baker penned episode that has a strong ' Doctor In The House ' feel to it , what with the anarchic students and infantile pranks . Its not surprising that the writers wrote for ' Doctor At Large ' that same year . Its hard to say for sure but the hospital exterior looks like the same one used in that other show . ' Bernard ' , the leader of the students , is played by future ' Robin Of Sherwood ' star Nickolas Grace . Funniest moment - Frankie leaning against the window of Duffy ' s van , only for his hand to pass through it as there is no glass there !

When the Purser's absence is noticed , suspicion falls on Duncan . Has he finally flipped and committed murder ? Duncan turns detective in this episode , attempting to clear his name before it is too late . Dick and Joyce don't offer much help , and behave as though they think he might actually be guilty .

401301	7743887	641206	7.0	McGill's Treasure Hunt	Richard Bradford said that several ' Suitcase ' episodes were originally intended for other shows . ' Find The Lady ' gives the impression of having been planned for either ' The Baron ' or ' The Saint ' . McGill is in Rome when he is visited by Mori ( John Garrie ) , a filthy little man who refers to him as ' Macagill ' . The Rossini jewels have been stolen , and Mori thinks he knows who the thief is - Guilio ( Maxwell Shaw ) , Italy's answer to ' Raffles ' . Mac is then called in by the local police , who want him to recover the missing gems . The Commandante ( Patrick Cargill ) confiscates his passport so that he cannot leave the country until the job is done . At a specially arranged rendezvous in a park , Mori meets Guilio . Mac is hiding , waiting to nab the gems . But things go wrong and a brief gun battle ensues . In the confusion , Mori runs off with the jewels and manages to hide them before Guilio kills him . Before he passes on , he whispers one word : ' Signora ' . . . A fairly uneventful adventure this , boasting lots of talk , mostly between Mac and the lovely Francesca ( Jeanne Roland ) . Clever old Mori hid the jewels in some catacombs , leading to a climactic fight there . Patrick Cargill is suitably sinister as the ' Commandante ' , more so than the jewel thief he is intent on arresting . Maxwell Shaw , who plays ' Guilio ' , was married to casting director , Rose Tobias Shaw . 1967 was a good year for lovely Jeanne Roland - in addition to this , she appeared in not one but two Bond movies : ' You Only Live Twice ' as Bond's masseuse , and as ' Captain of the Guards ' in the spoof version of ' Casino Royale ' . Carlos Douglas , the waiter in ' Duty Free ' , plays a hotel receptionist . The hotel lobby looks like the one used in ' Sweet Sue ' ( it probably was ) .

Noticing some lads absent from school , David tracks them to the Caribbean Billiard Hall . The boys have fallen in with a bad crowd , made up of absentees from Weaver Street School . They care little for their job prospects , and seem to think they can make a living at the green baize table . . . Not far from my local Secondary Modern was a seedy café which served as a refuge for pupils who'd opted-out of school . All day long boys would drink Coke , chat , play slot machines and cards . We called them ' mitchers ' . This Geoff Rowley and Andy Baker penned episode provides the new teacher with his first baptism of fire . Putting Mr . Dix in his place was nothing compared with overcoming teenage apathy . Robin Askwith appears as hustler ' Eddie ' , a character he previously played in ' The Fenn Street Gang ' episode ' Meet The Wizard ' . Charles Bolton is his dimwitted sidekick ' Godber ' from Weaver Street School . We will see more of him later . Future ' Eastenders ' star Shirley Cheriton has the small role of ' Pat ' . Funniest moment - Potter trying to play billiards !
401597	7743887	635118	8.0	The Hunting Of The Sandmen	Francis finally catches up with Logan , Jessica , and Rem . Leaving Rem in the company of fellow Sandman Benjamin , Francis takes the Runners back to the City Of Domes for reprogramming . En route , Jessica is abducted by James Borden , a big game hunter who lives in a gadget-packed house protected by a force field . Borden has grown tired of hunting Runners and is after bigger game - Sandmen . Equipped with a laser rifle , he stalks Logan and Francis through the forest , while his wife Irene goes after Jessica . . . Richard Connell's ' The Most Dangerous Game ' provided the inspiration for several T . V . sci-fi plots , such as ' The Incredible Hulk ' episode ' The Snare ' , here it is pressed into service for ' Logan's Run ' and makes a welcome respite from the normal pattern of the series . Horst Bucholz , who plays ' Borden ' , was the youngest member of the original - and best - ' Magnificent Seven ' , while Mary Woronov is mouth-wateringly sexy ( especially in a tiger skin dress ) as Irene . Logan and Francis work as a team for once . Episode could have been better directed , though ; the hunt consists of little else but people running through sunny forests . A few more death traps ( like the pit and the phantom cage ) would have been nice . Francis saves the day by shooting Borden . Logan lost his Gun near the pit , though Rem retrieves it later on . Sandmen are useless without their Guns , aren't they ?
401531	7743887	75950	8.0	" When the man at the top panics , the dominoes start to fall ! "	In the aftermath of Watergate , a number of conspiracy movies appeared , such as this one , written by the late Adam Kennedy ( based on his novel ) . Gene Hackman plays ex-Vietnam veteran ' Roy Tucker ' , a loser who has wound up in prison . He receives visits from Marvin Tagge ( Richard Widmark ) , who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted . They offer him freedom , and despite distrusting Tagge he accepts . But he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of Spiventa ( Mickey Rooney ) . Exactly why is hard to see , as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker mad with persistent talk of sex , not what you want to hear when you are behind bars . Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker's astonished eyes . Reunited with wife Ellie ( Candice Bergen ) , and given a new identity ( strangely , he does not attempt to change his appearance . Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ) , he settles down , but finds there is a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States . He refuses , so Tagge has Ellie abducted . . . I will leave the synopsis here , but I am sure you can guess the rest for yourself . The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that ! ) . The people Tagge represents are never revealed . The allusions to J . F . K . ' s killing are unmistakable . Despite the findings of The Warren Commission , the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day . This was Stanley Kramer's first movie in years , and while no turkey , it lacks the grip of say John Frankenheimer's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' or Alan J . Pakula's ' The Parallax View ' . Being a left-wing conspiracy movie , it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it . I prefer right-wing ones myself - they are funnier ! ' Domino ' has the look and feel of a made-for-T . V . movie , and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the Michael Caine classic ' Get Carter ' . What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark . The latter , who sadly passed away earlier this year , is superb as the mysterious Tagge , who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated , beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes . As Tucker , the innocent pawn , Hackman is marvellous . You have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place . In his shoes , I'd have fled to the other side of the world , anywhere to get away from these fanatics . Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down , and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched . Presumably the producers thought so too , which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warning the audience that ' they ' are out there , and that ' they ' are out to get us . Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B . B . C . show ' The Dawson Watch ' . Mickey Rooney had earlier worked with Kramer on ' Its A Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ' . His ' death ' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture , with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead . Conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left , but now the right are getting in on the act too . Last year , ' Taking Liberties ' , an absurd concoction of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's Government turned out to be Britain's answer to ' Reefer Madness ' . At least , ' Domino ' had lovely Candice Bergen . The best Chris Atkins ' film could offer was Anne Widdecombe ! Surprisingly , ' The Domino Principle ' was made by Sir Lew Grade , the legendary British television mogul behind ' The Saint ' , ' Jesus Of Nazareth ' and ' The Muppet Show ' . He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on ' Raise The Titanic ! ' , whose failure was so great it sank Grade's ambitions of being the new Louis B . Meyer . Being somewhat open-minded , I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy .

It isn't the most exciting place in the world to be ; the residents are elderly , and some appear senile . With no-one of his own age to talk to , Dennis quickly becomes bored . Hearing that his father is in hospital , Dennis cuts short the holiday . He finds a very different David Dunstable to the one he is used to - clean , well-mannered , and - most surprising of all - stone-cold sober . Dennis suggests his father return with him to the seaside . But for how long will the new image last ? Once more the late Peter Bayliss turns in a funny performance as ' David Dunstable ' , the man who makes Albert Steptoe seem like Noel Coward . Part of the fun here is the contrast between the drunken old sot he usually is and the reformed character he becomes . There's also a delightful film sequence showing Dennis at the seaside , which effectively conveys his boredom without once becoming boring itself . Funniest moment - David asking Nurse Maureen for a bedpan , and then - because he has the D . T . ' s - using it to swat imaginary insects on his bed !
400608	7743887	607966	8.0	" I've been caught by the Privates ! "	Its World War Two , and Frankie is part of a concert party out to entertain the troops in France . After becoming separated from his platoon , he wanders into an old farmhouse , wherein he is captured by members of The French Resistance , led by the stunning Captain Latour . Establishing his nationality by scrawling the word ' bum ' on a wall , Frankie is hurriedly bundled into a German Captain's uniform , moments before the Germans arrive . Having convinced them , Frankie finds himself having to backtrack when the British show up in force . . . Hugh Stuckey was an Australian comedy writer who worked on a number of British shows in the ' 70's , usually in collaboration with Peter Robinson . Stuckey had been the principal writer on the ill-fated ' Hancock Down Under ' series , never completed due to Hancock's suicide . This caper is what you would expect from a Frankie Howerd show , and may or may not have provided an influence on the later ' Allo , Allo ' . Caroline Munro , who plays ' Captain Latour ' was a stunningly beautiful woman who appeared in several films in the ' 70's , most notably ' Naomi ' the helicopter pilot in ' The Spy Who Loved Me ' . Funniest moment - attempting to cheer up the troops with his famed George Formby impression , Frankie is thrown bodily out of a moving truck . Clambering to his feet , he remarks : " How was I to know they didn't like George Formby ? " .
401695	7743887	818964	8.0	Billy Sees A Shrink !	Concerned by his son's inability to tell a truthful word , Mr . Fisher consults eminent psychiatrist Dr . Smiley . Questioning Billy , the doctor concludes that the elaborate fantasies are as a result of his craving for affection . Hence the Fishers , Gran , and even Mr . Shadrack , endeavour to be as nice to Billy as possible . But the strain of smiling all day long proves too much for them , and they start hitting the bottle . . . The peerless Roy Kinnear guest stars as ' Dr . Smiley ' . If nothing else , this episode gives us a chance to see George A . Cooper's father in a different key , being quieter and less aggressive towards Billy . By this stage in the series , Mr . Shadrach was almost one of the family . Though he does not really need to go along with the ' be nice to Billy ' deception , he pitches in all the same . Funniest moment - Gran sneakily helping herself to Mr . Fisher's whisky !
401389	7743887	818974	8.0	" Get ' em off then ! "	A game of Monopoly in the Fisher household turns into a blazing family row . Mr and Mrs . Fisher decide to go to the pub , leaving Billy alone with Barbara . Well , not quite , because his grandmother is there too , but Billy isn't concerned about her . He senses a golden opportunity to get his fiancée into bed . Whilst Barbara is making tea , Billy throws a jug of milk over her skirt , and tells her to go upstairs and slip out of her wet garments . She does so , and Billy strips off too , even though he is bone dry . Before Billy can have his evil way , however , his mother and family come home unexpectedly early . . . Yes , well we've all been here , haven't we ? This episode rings true with those of us who remember the golden days of courtship . Taking a girl out in those days was like driving a car with one foot on the accelerator and another on the brake ! Because ' Billy Liar ' went out post-watershed on a Saturday night ( at least in its first season ) , it was able to be a bit racier than most other sitcoms . No nudity as such , but we do get a fantasy sequence in which Billy imagines playing strip poker with Barbara , and gets her down to her underwear . Sally Watts is indeed a very well endowed young lady . Funniest moment - a ' Star Trek ' spoof in which Billy , as Captain Kirk , uses a phaser to zap his parents ! Then Mr . Shadrack materialises as ' Mr . Spock ' !
401466	7743887	86006	8.0	Move Over Moore ! The Other Feller's Back !	As the ' 70's drew to a close , rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - James Bond . Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the making of ' Moonraker ' by the B . B . C . ' s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect . Understandably , the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion . When ' Moonraker ' opened , Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character , and the jumping onto the ' Star Wars ' bandwagon much as ' Live & Let Die ' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier . Many publicly vocalised their hope that Connery would return , if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look . Years of legal battles followed . The original script , entitled ' James Bond Of The Secret Service ' ( later retitled ' Warhead ' ) was written by Kevin McClory , Len Deighton , and Connery , was never filmed , and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters . A new script , closer to the ' Thunderball ' storyline , was commissioned . It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior , best known as the man who put the camp into ' Batman ' . He had also written ' The Parallax View ' , one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers . Feeling the script needed a British touch , Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais , writers of hit British sitcoms ' The Likely Lads ' and ' Porridge ' . The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline . ' Never Say Never Again ' opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise ; normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at Connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the film . Many used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series , particularly that year's ' Octopussy ' . In truth , ' Octopussy ' is superior in every respect . ' Never ' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with Bond , at times it looks like a made-for-T . V . movie . The story had been done before and better in 1965's ' Thunderball ' , hence ' Never ' was always going to come off second best . It was also hampered by not being part of the official series , meaning that Monty Norman's ' James Bond Theme ' and Maurice Binder's gun-barrel logo could not be used . As Bond , Connery is magnificent , effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role . Playing Bond as an older , wiser agent worked . Barbara Carrera landed her best movie role as villainous ' Fatima Blush ' , a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing Bond . Kim Basinger smolders as ' Domino ' . As S . P . E . C . T . R . E . agent ' Maximillian Largo ' , Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance . A major disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as ' Blofeld ' . The posters gave the impression he would be a major character , in fact he appears only in a few scenes . With a stronger script , he could have been one of the all-time great Bond villains . ' Never ' promised to be a throwback to the early Eon Bonds such as ' From Russia With Love ' , but did not deliver . The gadgets were there , but were used almost apologetically . Bond's rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the ' 60's . The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humour . Bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in ' Moonraker ' . But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as bumbling Foreign Office official ' Nigel Small-Fawcett ' . He gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue . Michel Legrand's music is horrible , the man seems to never to have seen a Bond film in his life . Though the film was a financial success , viewed years later it stands as the weakest Bond of the ' 80's . Connery himself was disappointed with it , and not did act in a movie again for some years . 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs , in addition to the Connery and Moore movies , George Lazenby did a delightful cameo in the made-for-T . V . ' Return Of The Man From U . N . C . L . E . : The Fifteen Years Later Affair ' .
401451	7743887	287836	8.0	When Bobby Was On The Box	In the ' 80's , Bobby Davro was hotly tipped to replace Mike Yarwood as Britain's leading impressionist . The blonde , handsome Davro counted among his repertoire the likes of George Michael , Alex Higgins , Roy Castle , Jonathan King , Johnny Briggs , Duncan Norvelle and Jim Davidson . This series - whilst hardly original - was a perfect showcase for his talents , also featuring the equally brilliant Jessica Martin , best known as the voice of ' Madonna ' on ' Spitting Image ' . The unusually well-written sketches consisted mainly of take-offs of well-known shows such as ' Crimewatch U . K . ' , ' Adrian Mole ' and ' Blind Date ' . Unfortunately , a few years later , a purge of the more traditional British comedy styles saw Davro swept off the air , returning only occasionally as a contestant on shows such as ' Never Mind The Buzzcocks ' . Martin went on to a successful stage career , television seemingly not knowing what to do with such an amazingly talented woman .
401581	7743887	516843	8.0	The Ultimate In Camouflage !	As ' The Avengers ' series developed , a little repertory company was formed of performers who would appear in the show time and time again , mostly playing villains . The roster included Peter Jeffrey , Julian Glover , Peter Wyngarde , Patrick Cargill , Garfield Morgan , William Franklyn , Patrick Allen and Peter Bowles . The future ' Bounder ' was in three episodes : ' Second Sight ' , ' Escape In Time ' , and , of course , this . British Intelligence have picked up three Russian agents in Britain , here on a mission to assassinate top British operatives , and imprisoned them in a base concealed in a monastery . When two manage to escape from under the watchful eyes of the ' monks ' , and eliminate their designated targets , Steed is naturally worried . The third name on the hit list is his own . . . Bowles plays ' Ezdorf ' , the last of the Russians to pull off a daring escape act worthy of Houdini , with a little help from a bottle of Lizard vodka . When bathed in , it gives one the ability of a chameleon , hence the Russians are able to become invisible , fooling their captors into thinking they have escaped . As soon as the cell doors are opened , they slip away . The theme of invisible enemy agents had previously been explored in ' The See Through Man ' , also written by Philip Levene . The main difference is that here the invisibility is real ! In the 1998 movie , Patrick Macnee provided an amusing cameo as ' Colonel I . Jones ' , a camouflage expert so good at his job he literally could not be seen !
401256	7743887	956509	8.0	Bounder Bowles At Large	Trevor Mountjoy ( George Cole ) , successful estate agent , is happily married to the lovely Mary ( Rosalind Ayres ) . He goes home one day to find a drink waiting for him , and senses something is wrong . The couple's idyllic lifestyle has been shattered . Mary's freeloading brother Howard ( Peter Bowles ) has been released from prison after serving a two-year sentence for fraud . Worse , he has moved in with them . Howard plays for sympathy by leaning heavily on a stick and claiming to be a changed man , but Trevor is not too sure . He still calls him ' Trev ' for one thing . Finding the stick left round the house , he dashes round to the local pub , hoping to catch Howard out in a lie . But the wily bounder is prepared , telling Trevor the stick is a spare . . . Comedy writers are lucky to get one hit sitcom in their lifetimes . In the mid-'70's , Eric Chappell had two running concurrently on I . T . V . - ' Rising Damp ' and ' The Squirrels ' . If you think that is impressive , consider this - he pulled off the same trick a few years later with ' Duty Free ' and ' The Bounder ' . Peter Bowles had finished a long stint as rich hypochondriac ' Archie Glover ' in ' Only When I Laugh ' , and was keen to get his own show . Eric Chappell wrote this specially for him , in which he played suave confidence trickster ' Howard Booth ' , a sort of upmarket ' Mike Upchat ' from ' The Upchat Line / Connection ' . Like that other character , the show got much of its humour from Howard's spinning of elaborate lies , and then having to spin yet more to get out of trouble . ' Minder ' was running around this time , giving George Cole fans ( of whom I am one ) an extra chance to see their hero in action . ' Trevor Mountjoy ' is essentially a supporting role , but Cole made more of it than was there on the printed page . His looks of exasperation at Howard's behaviour are wonderful . Rosalind Ayres ( wife of Martin Jarvis ) played ' Mary ' in the first season , while Isla Blair was cast as lovely ' Laura Miles ' , a rich widow whom Howard has set his sights on . His pursuit of her became a running theme through the series ( speaking of Isla , I recall her going on the phone-in show ' Open Air ' in the ' 80's and cringing in embarrassment when a caller addressed her as ' Isla St . Clair ' ! ) . Ironically , Laura lost money by investing in Howard's company . The truth be known , there are not that many laughs in the first episode but it served a purpose in establishing the characters and premise . It improved sharply with the next episode . The opening violin theme was ' Winter ' from Vivaldi's ' The Four Seasons ' combined with an original composition by the late , talented Peter Knight ( also wrote the ' Duty Free ' signature ) . Funniest moment - Howard dancing gaily with Laura , unaware that Trevor and Mary are behind him , glowering .
401417	7743887	77020	8.0	Pronounced ' azell	' Hazell ' was the creation of Gordon Williams and Terry Venables ( yes , that Terry Venables ! ) . A sort of Cockney version of ' Philip Marlowe ' , James Hazell looked cool driving around ' 70's London in his Triumph Stag . His main adversary was Detective-Inspector ' Choc ' Minty , a hard-faced Scotsman who acted as a kind of ' Teal ' to Hazell's ' Saint ' . With its brassy opening theme and Bond-style titles , ' Hazell ' blasted onto I . T . V . with the force of a howitzer . The plots ran the gamut of ' 70's crime show clichés ( missing children , drug smuggling , bank raids ) , with Hazell often on the receiving end of a good hiding from some underworld felon . What lifted it above the average were the witty scripts and Nicholas Ball's laconic performance in the title role . At the time , he was married to ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' star Pamela Stephenson . ' Hazell ' made him a star , but alas the fame it brought him was fleeting . Allegedly the series ended after only two seasons because Ball issued an ultimatum - do it on film or else . The prospect of ' Hazell ' becoming a Euston Films Production was certainly intriguing , but alas it wasn't to be . Williams and Venables later confessed that they thought him too young for the role anyway , their preferred choices were John Bindon and Michael Elphick . I . T . V . briefly considered reviving the series a few years ago , but decided against it on the grounds that it was ' dated and sexist ' . Haven't times changed !
400848	7743887	956728	8.0	" I'm a decorator ! "	Having been sacked by the G . P . O . , Peter Craven is working alongside Duffy and Batch as an interior decorator . Their first job is to paint a block of flats , owned by Mr . Stringer , a man so miserable as to give Rigsby from ' Rising Damp ' a run for his money . Meanwhile , Dennis has left home , and when he cannot find accommodation Duffy suggests he spend a night in one of Stringer's unoccupied flats . That night , Stringer shows up with a pretty girl in tow , and finds Dennis there in his pyjamas . . . Okay episode , notable mainly for the appearance of the late Dudley Foster as ' Mr . Stringer ' . This talented actor ( who sadly committed suicide in 1973 ) appeared in numerous films and television series of the 60's / early ' 70's . ' Steptoe & Son ' fans will remember him as the detective in the episode ' Robbery With Violence ' . His wife is played by Fanny Carby , another sitcom regular , mostly cast as nosey housewives . Funniest moment - a pyjama-clad Dennis attempting to justify his presence in the flat to Mr . Stringer . Pretending to be a decorator , he grabs a paint brush and makes a horrendous red daub on the door .
401357	7743887	590990	8.0	The Goodies In The Club	The Minister For Trade & Domestic Affairs wants the Goodies to recover compromising photos of her taken at the Playgirl Club . Tim goes undercover in drag . The Club is a veritable den of iniquity , with strip shows , saunas , massage rooms and displays of openly uninhibited behaviour . When Tim fails to report back , Graeme and Bill decide to rescue him . But the only way to get in is to pose as ' male bunnies ' a . k . a . ' Wolves ' . . . This satire on the so-called Permissive Society was made before the B . B . C . came to see ' The Goodies ' as a children's show . Its also one of the best episodes of Season 1 , despite boasting little by way of visual humour . A pre-'Are You Being Served ? ' Mollie Sugden plays the talkative Minister , with ' Carry On ' blonde bombshell Liz Fraser as the club's Mae West-style proprietor . Queenie Watts would later play Arthur Mullard's wife ' Lil ' in I . T . V . ' s ' Romany Jones ' and ' Yus My Dear ' . Tim gets to use his ' Lady Constance ' voice from ' I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again ' . Yes , the scenes in the Playgirl Club are sexist ( there's some nudity on display ) , and this has led to the episode being branded ' politically incorrect ' . U . K . Gold included it in a season of programmes called ' The Dog House ' . I can't help thinking that if it had been written by a woman though , it would today be regarded as a monument to female liberation . Funniest moment - Bill and Graeme attempting to identify the club's owner by the colour of her underwear ! Yes , that scene !
401131	7743887	224848	8.0	The Joke's On Us	Millions watched this every Sunday evening ( including myself ) , mainly to laugh at the clips of horrible foreign programmes such as ' Endurance ' , ' Ultra Quiz ' and ' The Price Is Right ' . Back in the early ' 80's , we could safely laugh in the knowledge that our television was the best in the world . Clive made an excellent presenter , erudite as well as witty . Unfortunately , British producers then thought it would be a great idea to copy the programmes being ridiculed . The three listed above were subsequently adapted for British audiences . Twenty-odd years later , our television is indistinguishable from the infantile dross Clive regularly used to make fun of . Noisy , game-show contestants prepared to make utter fools of themselves , hyper-active hosts , tacky sets , live insects consumed with relish by publicity-seeking idiots , we've got them all . Worse , Clive isn't around to mock them . Hasn't the ' joke ' rather backfired somewhat ?
401143	7743887	675791	8.0	Sister Maureen ?	5C are thrilled to learn that Bobby Charlton is coming to the school . All except for Maureen , that is . Dismayed at Mr . Hedges ' impending marriage to Penny , she plans on becoming a nun . After Sharon spots her entering a convent with a suitcase , Mr . Hedges goes to see Monsignor Sopwith , to try and persuade him to talk Maureen out of making a hasty decision . . . When the cast of ' Please Sir ! ' were reunited in 1985 as part of I . T . V . ' s ' T . V . Weekly ' , the late Liz Gebhardt remarked on her physical resemblance to a stick insect . I always thought she looked remarkably frail . Indeed one of her later roles was as an anorexic in the A . T . V . daytime soap ' General Hospital ' . I'm sure this episode must have been among her favourites , it gives her a bit more to do than just weep . As it turns out , Maureen was only going to the convent to donate old clothes to charity . Roland MacLeod , who plays the ' Monsignor ' , was a familiar face to viewers through roles in such series as ' Marty ' , ' The Goodies ' and ' The Fall & Rise Of Reginald Perrin ' . His best scene is when he turns up at the school , as a last-minute replacement for Bobby Charlton , and proceeds to win the class over . Funniest moment - Potter attempting to teach 5C boys about car maintenance , using Mr . Cromwell's car as a guinea pig . Unfortunately , after removing the water pump , he finds he does not know how to replace it ! Spot The Mistake - When Maureen takes a collection tin into the staff room , she addresses Smithy as ' Mr . Price ' !
401008	7743887	30824	8.0	" I had my mouth all set for apple pie ! "	Stan and Ollie turn up in Switzerland , of all places . Stan thinks that they will be able to sell mouse traps to the Swiss because there are more mice there than anywhere else in the world . The owner of a cheese factory offers to buy their stock , but pays with counterfeit money . Thinking they are rich , Stan and Ollie celebrate with a slap-up meal at a local hotel . Then comes the crunch - they are unable to pay the bill . The hotel owner sets them to work as dishwashers . In no time at all , most of the crockery is broken . Also at the hotel is an American composer , trying to write a new musical . His wife shows up and , in an effort to make her husband notice her , pretends to flirt with Ollie . . . One of the weaker Laurel and Hardy features , this still manages to be a lot of fun . Stan and Ollie have some great scenes together , such as their drilling holes in the cheese factory's wooden floor , playing a tune by popping soap bubbles coming out of an organ , and Ollie serenading the Della Lind character . Switzerland as depicted here is peopled by blonde girls in pigtails , and yodelling men in leather shorts with feathers stuck in their hats , but who cares ? ' Bonnie Scotland ' was hardly an accurate depiction of that country either . Funniest moment - a close run between Stan's attempts to get a barrel of brandy from a St . Bernard's neck , or his and Ollie moving a piano across a rope bridge , where they encounter a gorilla ( don't ask ) . Did I hear someone say dated ? Well , Stan and Ollie never needed to swear or fart to get laughs , did they , unlike today's ' comics ' . Altogether , a pleasant viewing experience .
401577	7743887	500258	8.0	" There's Something Suspicious About A Man Who Keeps His Booze Under Lock & Key ! "	The negative response to the new B . B . C . series ' Ashes To Ashes ' ( good , but not a patch on ' Life On Mars ' ) has revived in this reviewer memories of when the fourth series of the sci-fi drama ' Blake's 7 ' aired . Like ' A . T . A . ' , Year 4 was initially met with hostility from fans . It was the first to lack involvement from its creator , Terry Nation , and a new producer - Vere Lorrimer - replaced David Maloney , who had left to produce a well-regarded adaptation of ' The Day Of The Triffids ' . The climax of the previous year necessitated the need for change , with ' Liberator ' gone , a ship had to be found for Avon and his crew . Also , Jan Chappell left , which meant ' Cally ' had to be written out , and a new crew member - ' Soolin ' - substituted . Dudley Simpson's closing theme was rearranged , and some impressive new titles by Douglas Burd ( including a new logo ) appeared . Over the course of three series , ' Blake's 7 ' had established a loyal fan base , and a regular audience in the region of ten million viewers ( achieved despite it often going out in opposition to ' Coronation Street ' ) . The net result of all these changes occurring simultaneously was to cause offence , and soon the letters pages of ' The Radio Times ' teemed with protests . One reader likened ' Scorpio ' to an ' animated door wedge ' , while another missed the ' subtle interplays of characterisation ' from the earlier series . ' Rescue ' begins where ' Terminal ' left off , with Avon and co . marooned on the artificial planet of the same name . Servalan has left a couple of booby-traps for them to fall into ; one of which kills Cally . Recovering very quickly from her demise , they face further perils from hostile snake-like creatures . Just when it appears they are doomed , a mysterious stranger named Dorian saves them . Dorian is a kind of intergalactic scrap dealer . The ungrateful Avon takes control of his ship , only to find it is on a pre-programmed flight course to Xenon . The only other person in Dorian's life is the beautiful but enigmatic Soolin . Searching the underground base , Dayna discovers a secret room inhabited by a hideous alien . The first twenty-five minutes of ' Rescue ' are indeed tremendous ; neatly dovetailing into the end of ' Terminal ' , it crackles along with great dialogue and some decent action scenes ( one thing ' Blake's 7 ' excelled at was explosions ! ) , but as soon as we get to Xenon we are plunged into a bland sci-fi remake of Oscar Wilde's ' The Picture Of Dorian Gray ' . ' Dr . Who ' fans who complained about Russell T . Davies paying homage to ' The Poseidon Adventure ' in ' Voyage Of The Damned ' need to realise that he was not the first writer on a sci-fi show to plunder the past in search of inspiration . The late Geoffrey Burridge gives a wonderful performance as ' Dorian ' , charming and sinister by turns , and you almost wish he'd been made a regular . Sadly , he died six years after this was made . The stunningly beautiful Glynis Barber does not get to make much of a debut , and would be severely underused for much of the early part of this season . Overall , a fair start to what turned out to Blake's final run . Incidentally , it went out in 1981 , the very year in which ' Ashes To Ashes ' is set .
400645	7743887	563126	8.0	" Koch is a German ! "	St . Swithins gets its very own radio service . Loftus unwisely entrusts Waring and Stuart-Clark with the task of making it a success . Dick sees it as a golden opportunity to make a quick buck by incorporating local business ads into his ' History Of St . Swithins ' broadcasts , while Gascoigne writes a melodramatic play about Louis Pasteur . MacKenzie provides sound effects . It sounds like a recipe for disaster - and is . The patients get bored and watch old George Formby films on television . Until Nurse Sheila Reynolds saves the day by trying to chat up Duncan on air . Their saucy banter makes ' Radio St . Swithins ' a massive hit . Loftus requests further instalments . . . Pretty amusing episode , enlivened by David Kelly of ' Robin's Nest ' fame as a patient , and Alison King as the Duncan-fixated Nurse Sheila Reynolds , ( first introduced in ' When A Body Meets A Body ' ) , clearly in the mould of ' Dr . Mary Bingham ' from ' Doctor In Charge ' . Funniest moment - a drunken MacKenzie rambling on air about his marital problems !
401125	7743887	563065	8.0	" Only tell me when I'm wrong ! "	The job of junior houseman at St . Swithins is once more up for grabs . Professor Loftus decides to give it to his former student Duncan Waring . The previous incumbent , Mike Upton , joined the Merchant Navy to escape the attentions of Nurse Willett , to whom he drunkenly proposed one night . Back in Britain following a year-long course in America , Duncan is looking forward to seeing his old friends again . But they have decided to play a cruel trick on him . When he arrives , everyone pretends not to remember him . Even his old girlfriend Sandra Crumpton is in on the joke . . . Exhausted by the punishing filming schedule ( 29 episodes in one year ) Barry Evans made his final appearance as ' Dr . Mike Upton ' in a short ' Doctor At Large ' sketch shown as part of ' Mike & Bernie's All-Star Christmas Comedy Carnival ' on / 71 . Sadly , it no longer exists . The series should logically have ended with his departure . With recasting ruled out , the obvious solution was to replace ' Upton ' with a new character . Taking note of the fate of ' Please Sir ! ' the year before ( it sank with all hands on deck following the loss of John Alderton ) , the producers decided to bring back ' Duncan Waring ' from ' In The House ' . Robin Nedwell was a different kind of actor to Barry Evans . He was more extroverted , wore outrageous bow ties , and was particularly adept at physical comedy . You could not imagine Upton panicking on a railway crossing ( ' Honeymoon Special ' ) , mountaineering up the side of a building ( the ' Doctor On The Go ' episode ' Keep Your Nose Clean ! ' ) , or doing a frog impression to get out of the Royal Navy ( ' Hello Sailor ! ' ) . According to Roger Wilmut in his book ' From Fringe To Flying Circus ' , John Cleese found the ' Upton ' character difficult to write for . Whenever he wrote funny lines for him , the scripts would be returned with the comment ' Barry wouldn't say lines like that ' , hence Cleese had to create situations in which other people did or said amusing things , while Upton stood in the middle , smiling amiably . I think this is a bit harsh , but Cleese's view has to be respected . No disrespect to Evans ' memory , but in my view the ' Doctor ' series hit its stride with ' In Charge ' . The early episodes featured Mollie Sugden as Duncan's overprotective mother and Sammie Winmill as his sexy girlfriend Sandra . These characters would later be phased out . Written by Graham Chapman and Bernard McKenna , ' The Devil You Know ' is hardly a great example of the show , but serves its purpose in bringing Duncan back aboard , and establishing that Upton is no longer around . There is something of a ' Twilight Zone ' air , as Duncan is made to feel as though he never ever existed at St . Swithins . Funniest moment - relieved to find that Loftus remembers him , Duncan greets him like a long-lost brother - much to the stuffy Professor's embarrassment .

They are there because each possesses the knowledge and abilities to rebuild a post-atomic holocaust world . Unfortunately , they have a terrible disease that can only be cured by vaccine from two phials . En route to the vault , Logan and his friends experience an earthquake and one of the phials is accidentally smashed , leaving enough vaccine for only three people . But which three ? One of the revived six thinks it should be him / her - and begins killing the others . . . Interesting sci-fi variant on Agatha Christie's ' And Then There Were None ' ( alright , that wasn't the name of the book , but I'm not brave enough to write it ) , based on a story by Harlan Ellison , though the script is credited to Al Hayes . Rem turns detective , and the only thing he lacks is a deerstalker and meerschaum pipe . Logan seems rather sidelined for the most of the episode , he doesn't even get to carry Jessica when she is wounded . One of the great things about viewing this series in the 21st century is being able to freeze the picture whenever Jessica's underwear comes into view , a pleasure denied to 1977 viewers . Anyway , frippery aside , its a good little episode , though no ' The City On The Edge Of Forever ' or ' Demon With A Glass Hand ' . The late Christopher Stone does a nice line in red herrings .
401282	7743887	1321969	9.0	The Two Davids	The Tardis lands in Victorian London . It is Christmas . Hearing someone call his name , the Doctor rushes off , to find a young woman cowering in terror from something behind a locked door . A man in Dickensian clothes appears , announces himself as the Doctor , and takes charge of the situation . . . . Another Christmas , another ' Dr . Who ' Christmas Special . I'll start this review by stating what I did not like about this one . Firstly , the Cybershades were absolutely awful , reminiscent of the sticky tape and cardboard monsters of the classic series . It was impossible to be unnerved by creatures that looked exactly like what they were - blokes in gorilla suits wearing coal scuttles . Worse , there was no need for them to be there . Cybermats should have been used instead . Secondly , the mystery of the ' next Doctor ' was unnecessarily protracted . All the Doctor had to do was to whip out a stethoscope and listen to Lake's heart ( apparently such a scene was filmed but deleted from the finished broadcast ) to see if he was a Time Lord . Now we know David Morrissey will not be the eleventh Doctor - thank heavens for that . Colin Baker was wrong when he said the role of the Doctor was ' actor proof ' . Morrissey would have been an absolute disaster as a ' real ' Doctor . He was good as ' Jackson Lake ' in his scenes with Tennant though . Loved his ' sonic screwdriver ' ! The Cybermen seemed a bit wasted , getting to do little more than march about and look menacing . The real villainy came from sexy Dervla Kirwan as ' Miss Hartigan ' , easily the best female villain in the show's long history . She had joined forces with the Cybermen to help them construct a ' Cyber King ' , a giant-sized version who proceeded to stamp Godzilla-like on poor old London Town . Why did the Cybermen need children to work in their factory ? Surely adults could have done the job more efficiently . Watching this made me even more sorry that Tennant is leaving next year . He did wonders with what was basically an average script . It is going to be hard for whoever replaces him . An unpopular new Doctor could spell the show's end in 2010 . I hope not . The appearance of the earlier Doctors was nice , and there were some good jokes , but overall this was the weakest of the ' Dr . Who ' Christmas Specials , a damp squib after last year's hugely enjoyable ' Voyage Of The Damned ' . But ' The Next Doctor ' got eleven million viewers , overtaking ' Eastenders ' , so I'm clearly in a minority here .
400780	7743887	640779	9.0	" I think he's going to dust us ! "	Sloane goes to Santa Maria , Brazil , in response to a message from U . N . I . T . agent Jacobsen . He finds the man's corpse in a deserted laboratory . A sole locust provides the only clue . Suddenly , gun men appear . Sloane flees . As he drives off , more gun men block the road and prepare to open fire . Swerving , the car goes straight into the river . The would-be killers think Sloane has flipped and laugh . But a moment later , the car emerges from the water and drives to safety up the other side of the riverbank . Sloane gets the last laugh . A farmer toiling in the fields is attacked by a horde of hungry locusts . They are hybrids , produced as a result of mating ordinary bugs with a somewhat more malign strain known as The Devil's Locust . Anyone unlucky enough to be bitten by one dies within ten seconds . They are controlled by KARTEL agent Penelope Chandler , using an electronic device that can simulate the bug's mating call . Sloane goes to Whitley University to meet Dr . Chris Bishop ( Barbara Rucker ) , the country's number one entomologist and wouldn't you know it , a very attractive woman . Her mentor , Dr . Rand , was recently killed in a plane crash . Or so the world believes . In fact , he is alive and well and in the employ of Chandler , who intends to use the locusts to create famine by destroying America's wheat and grain supplies . . . One of the more outrageous episodes in the series , ' Lady Bug ' is also tremendous fun . In a nod to Hitchcock's ' North By Northwest ' , Sloane is attacked by a crop dusting plane , though the resolution is somewhat different . He survives by breathing air from one of the tyres of a tractor . Edie Adams is cast as ' Chandler ' , a lady with a fondness for chocolates as well as surrounding herself with brawny young men in swimming trunks . I have to say I found her more cute than menacing . Jessica Walter would have better suited the role . The business with the Director and Kelly's umbrella gun looks as though the producer realised they were under running and needed to pad the episode out a bit . Sloane's gadgets - where to begin ? Chased by KARTEL men , our hero lobs a dollar in their direction , exclaiming : " Keep the change ! " . The coin then emits an incapacitatory gas . Sloane's amphibious car was obviously inspired by Roger Moore's in ' The Spy Who Loved Me ' . Whether it also fires rockets we can only guess at . Kelly gives Sloane a tape recorder concealed in a watch . He also has a device for electrifying a door handle ( giving him time to search a room ) and a fake bunch of keys that , when touched , gives a nasty shock . At the end , he is seen chatting to the Director on a video screen inside a cigarette case . No wonder I like this episode ! When the locusts attack Chandler's plane at the end , some appear to have grown to giant-size . Either the hybrid's D . N . A . was unstable or else there was dodgy process photography here . I suspect the latter was the case . Pity . A possible follow-up in which gargantuan locusts attacked major cities would have been great !
401235	7743887	202735	9.0	Charades On Television	A sketch in ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' had an out-of-work actor ( Griff Rhys Jones ) receiving bad news in the post . " Dear Sir " , it said : " We would like you to appear on ' Give Us A Clue ' . " . So horrified was the poor guy that he shot himself . What can one say about ' Give Us A Clue ' ? This Thames panel game was basically charades on television , with two teams of celebrities ( three men versus three women ) competing against one another to see who could come up with the outrageous mimes . It got going in 1978 , with Michael Aspel ( later Parkinson ) as host , Una Stubbs ( later Liza Goddard ) as one team captain , with a saluting Lionel Blair as the other ( my late father detested Blair with a vengeance , and hurled insults at the screen whenever he was on . ' Effeminate ' being a cleaned up version of his most frequently used one . My mother once pointed out that Lionel had fathered children , to which Dad sneeringly responded : " They're probably not his ! " . Ah , that man's rapier-like wit is sorely missed ) . Amongst the good sports ( or sad losers , depending on your view ) were Paul Henry ( ' Benny ' from ' Crossroads ' ) , Jon Pertwee , Joyce Blair ( Lionel's sister ) , Madelaine Smith , Michael Barrymore ( in the days when he was funny ) , Billy Dainty , Bernie Winters , Honor Blackman , Francoise Pascal , Gabrielle Drake , Roy Kinnear , Brian Marshall ( they were probably short of people that week ) , Alfred Marks , and Harry H . Corbett . The early shows included members of the public as team members . I do not know where they got these poor sods from , but they managed to be fairly useless . A man made a right berk of himself one night miming his own name . He had read the wrong side of his card ! Warren Mitchell went on once , and , slipping into his ' Alf Garnett ' persona , rebuked Una ( she had a charming habit of sticking her bottom in the air when miming - no wonder I loved the show ! ) in no uncertain terms . When Warren read the title of his next mime , the studio ( those privileged to see what it was ) erupted in laughter . It was ' Mind Your Language ' ! On a sadder note , the great Marty Feldman made one of his last television appearances on this show . Recently returned from the States , ( following his sacking by Universal studios ) , he looked haggard ( he sported a beard ) and unwell . Though Lionel introduced him as ' that genius of comedy ' , Marty's heart was just not in the game . He could barely raise a smile . It was sad to see him in such a dreadful state . One of the early shows featured Libby Morris ( forgotten now , but a very funny lady in her day ) trying to mime International Rugby League . I cannot do justice to her performance , but the harder she worked at it the more confused the team got . When she finished I had tears rolling down my face . Another wonderful performance came from the tough guy-actor George Sewell , who had to do ' The Virgin Soldiers ' . He got ' soldiers ' right , but just how do you convey virginity in mime ? He had a good go though , putting his lips to his fingers to denote innocence . ' Clue ' ran for years , surviving ( as previously pointed out ) a change of host and team captain . An attempt by the B . B . C . to revive it some years back as an early morning show did not work out . The early editions boasted a catchy but familiar sounding theme tune by the talented Alan Hawkshaw . I say familiar because it was the same as the B . B . C . ' s children's show ' Grange Hill ' ! I never found out how it came to be used on two shows broadcast at the same time on different channels . Thames later replaced it with an original composition by the equally talented Denis King .
400949	7743887	1231139	9.0	" You silly bitch ! "	Peter is trying to teach Sheila to drive . She damages the car and he has to call the local garage . A pair of mechanics ( Alun Armstrong and Malcolm Storry ) turn up , take one look at the vehicle , and pronounce it as being not worthy of repair . When Peter calls at the garage days later to collect the car , he has to deal with Mr . Myers ( Richard Wilson ) who is completely unhelpful . Called away to deal with another problem , Myers leaves Peter to answer the phone - an irate customer venting his spleen . The car back on the road again , he resumes his wife's learning , but she is utterly hopeless and backs into an articulated lorry . When he gets out to deal with the angry driver ( the term ' road rage ' had not been coined then , but it existed believe you me ) , she drives off , forcing him to give chase on foot . . . The second episode of ' Breath ' will ring a bell with anyone who's been ripped off by garages ( I used to work in one ) , staffed by shysters who exploit their customers ' general ignorance of motor cars . The guy I was unlucky enough to have as my boss once overcharged a customer simply out of contempt for the make of car he was driving ! At the end , when Peter revisits the garage , Mr . Myers tries to flog him a new vehicle . Typical ! As ' Victor Meldrew ' of ' One Foot In The Grave ' , Richard Wilson would experience similar problems with mechanics . Interesting to compare this with another ' lost ' David Jason sitcom - ' The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs ' . Briggs only reacted to events , here Barnes was responsible for them . Funniest moment - cleaning the windscreen , Sheila complains of one impossible-to-shift speck of dirt . Peter points out it is the other side of the tax disc !
400887	7743887	180355	9.0	" The Only Way I Can Stay Alive Is To Stay Dead ! "	' The Hanged Man ' , an eight-part drama series from Yorkshire Television , played like a British version of the American thriller ' Point Blank ! ' . The late Colin Blakely played ' Lew Burnett ' , owner of a construction empire he had built up from nothing . The story begins with Burnett - wearing a yellow hard-hat and council workman's jacket - driving a dump-truck along clifftops when , suddenly , the brakes fail , causing him to lose control and plunge into the sea . He survives with minor injuries , but now is seriously worried . This is the third such ' accident ' to befall him in recent weeks . Who wants to kill him ? In a voice over ( which would be repeated each week ) , he says : " The only way I can stay alive is to stay dead . So I can find out who's trying to kill me . And why . " . With the world believing him to have perished , Burnett is free to move like a wraith through the criminal underworld , looking back on his past life in a desperate gamble to find who hated him enough to destroy him . He questions suspects and , when necessary , gets rough with them . One was ' Turtle ' , a small-time crook played by John F . Landry , who got his own show a few years later - ' Turtle's Progress ' . All came well in the final episode of ' The Hanged Man ' with Burnett finally discovering the identity of his would-be killer . It was written by Edward Ward , a scriptwriter of some considerable reputation with episodes of ' Man In A Suitcase ' and ' The Main Chance ' ( starring John Stride ) to his credit . There was a book based on the show , and a long-playing record . In common with a lot of drama series of the period , it was a bit talky , but nevertheless gripping and well acted . It went out latish on Saturday nights , a good time for thriller shows . There was even a show called ' Thriller ' in that slot at one point . Dominating the show was the wonderful Blakely , giving a moody and intense performance as the revenge-seeking ' Burnett ' . My father though took a different view . After viewing the trailer , he said : " Its rubbish . All about a builder who gets involved in daring escapades ! " . Of course it was not like that . I would very much like to see it again . That's all I can remember about this . Except for one interesting bit of trivia - Alan Tew's powerful theme tune was later reused by ' The Two Ronnies ' as the intro to their ' Piggy Malone / Charley Farley ' serial ' Stop - You're Killing Me ' !
401439	7743887	74045	9.0	" Hear The Phantom Of The Opera Sing A Haunting Melody "	' Rentaghost ' was a children's comedy series by Bob Block , who also wrote the equally bizarre ' Pardon My Genie ' and ' Robert's Robots ' . It concerned an employment agency , run and staffed by three ghosts - trendy Fred Mumford , Victorian Hubert Davenport and jester Timothy Claypole . All used to ' teleport ' by pinching their noses ! Their landlord , and frequent victim , was Mr . Meaker . Each week , the Rentaghost gang would try their hand at something new - a taxi service , furniture removals , or entertaining hospital patients - usually with disastrous results . Mr . Claypole was always misinterpreting instructions - once , when asked to help Fred's parents move house - he did exactly that . Another story had Mr . Meaker turn into a budgie , and in yet another , his wife became a cocker spaniel . Whenever the doorbell rang , she barked ! Fred's parents didn't know their son was dead - he was killed whilst working abroad - hence on home visits , he had to throw Mother's dinners away ( ghosts don't eat ) . All very silly , but done with great panache . And it had one of the greatest theme tunes ever !
401088	7743887	665425	9.0	Cold Turkey For The Butlers !	1971 saw ' On The Buses ' reach its peak in terms of popularity . Season 4 spilled over from the year before , bringing many fine episodes like ' Cover Up ' and ' Not Tonight ' . The release of the first movie , which became the highest grosser in the U . K . Season 5 appeared in the autumn , and was lapped up by a grateful public . To those perplexed by the popularity of this show , the answer is this - not only was it funny , but the characters were so well depicted the viewers came to think of them almost as friends . We have all met or know of a cheeky chappy like Jack , an over-protective parent such as ' Mum ' , and a frumpy housewife akin to Olive . Bossy authority figures such as Blakey continue to exist to this day ( unfortunately ) . The year was rounded off by this enjoyable episode , in which Arthur's mother and sister Linda come to stay with the Butlers for a week . Linda is attracted to any man she meets ; she immediately has the hots for Jack , and later Stan ( technically , this is incest , but we'll let that pass ) . At the Boxing Day Social , Arthur tries to keep Jack and Linda apart , and urges Olive to intervene . But she gets drunk and after a blowsy clippie shows interest in her husband makes an exhibition of herself . Taking Mrs . Rudge around the buses , Blakey is horrified to find Stan and Linda in one , the latter minus her tights . . . Helen Fraser plays lascivious ' Linda ' ; best known to comedy fans as ' Lil ' in the Lampwick sketches in ' The Dick Emery Show ' , and ' Dr . Mary Bingham ' in ' Doctor In Charge ' . Though she is excellent here , she went on to belittle ' On The Buses ' in an interview published in ' T . V . & Satellite Weekly ' in 2005 . " It was a terrible show . " , she said . " Goodness knows why it was so successful . " . And this from one of the cast of ' Bad Girls ' . Funniest moment - Olive getting drunk at the Social , and trying to show Arthur up by lifting her skirt . Good thing she remembered to put underwear on that morning . Complements of the season to all I . M . D . B . users ( even those who hate me ) , and , in particular ' Jackm-15 ' and ' Deathmark VIII ' . Keep those splendid reviews coming , fellers !
401401	7743887	665446	9.0	All Dressed Up With . . .	Stan and Jack plan a naughty night in with two sexy clippies whilst Mum , Arthur and Olive are at Aunt Maud's . There's just one snag - Arthur's motorbike is in urgent need of repair . In desperation , Stan smuggles into the depot the bracket used to hold the bike to the sidecar so that Jack can perform an impromptu welding job . But will the bracket hold ? ' On The Buses ' kicked off its fourth season with this amiable episode . By now the cast were well acquainted with their characters and viewers knew just what to expect . As a result of its success , the cast were invited onto other shows ; for instance , Anna Karen appeared as ' Olive ' on ' The Max Bygraves Show ' , while Stephen Lewis ' ' Blakey ' ( rather improbably ) sang a duet with Cilla Black on her B . B . C . - 1 series ! Mike Yarwood included ' Blakey ' as part of his repertoire for a time . Funniest moment - Stan trying to fit Mum's plant in the sidecar . Closing the door , he lops the heads off !
401234	7743887	64699	9.0	Tell The Critics To Buzz Off !	1944 ; the Nazis are sending V-2's ( flying bombs ) to London . These have an unnerving tendency to fall silent just before they hit , meaning that no-one in the capital can be sure exactly where they will next strike . This is an impressive opening indeed , and would have been even more so had it not been lifted wholesale from the middle section of ' Operation Crossbow ' , made by M . G . M . four years before . Those gallant lads of the R . A . F . ' Mosquito Squadron ' swing into action . Headed by the wonderfully-named Squadron Leader Quint Monroe ( David McCallum ) they bomb the launching pads . But a surprise Messerschmitt attack results in Monroe losing his best friend ' Scotty ' ( David Buck ) . The Squadron Leader is given the duty of imparting the bad news to Scotty's widow Beth ( Suzanne Neve ) . Not only is she beautiful but apparently telepathic - as soon as Quint approaches she bursts into tears and runs from the room , and he has not said a word ! She recovers and then both are are going for long drives in the country in his sporty red M . G . Though the V-2 launching pads are now gone , the crisis is not yet over as the Nazis are busy developing V-3 and V-4 rockets , using Chavron Château in France as a headquarters , and the Mosquitoes are given the job of bombing the place . Obviously those fellers at The War Office are huge ' Star Wars ' fans because their favoured method involves dropping a bouncing bomb ( based on an idea by Barnes Wallis ) down a narrow tunnel . With only nine days to go , Monroe and co . begin training . They are not very good though ( The Force is never around when you need it ) . Just as they get the hang of things , disaster strikes . German planes attack an airfield , dropping a box that turns out to contain a roll of film ( someone says ' its a roll of film ! ' which is helpful to those of us who have no idea what a roll of film looks like ) . On it is footage of British P . O . W . ' s , some from the Squadron itself . The Nazis have placed the men in close proximity to Chavron , hoping to use them as human shields . Particularly worrying for Monroe is the fact that Scotty is among them . . . ' Mosquito Squadron ' was originally conceived as a sequel to the popular ' 633 Squadron ' ( 1964 ) starring Cliff Robertson . Presumably this was changed out of reluctance on the part of Oakmont Productions to pay Frederick E . Smith royalties . Like that movie , it has a paper-thin plot , one-dimensional characters , repetitive battle scenes , and good music . Some of the shots in the film ( those not from ' Operation Crossbow ' ) came from that earlier picture . McCallum was a hot property then thanks to ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' , but somehow his popularity never translated into bums on cinema seats . The director , the late Boris Sagal , directed several ' U . N . C . L . E . ' episodes . Not being an expert on W . W . 2 , I cannot say with absolute certainty that this is embarrassingly inaccurate , but we do not see David McCallum sending text messages to The War Office , and that's enough for me . What it has going for it are a refreshing lack of forced jingoism , and the absence of an American star in the lead . I note that some of the sniffy reviews to be found here are by Americans . I presume they are unused to watching a war movie in which one of their countrymen does not save the day . You can summarise the plot thus ; Blighty is in peril , only the Mosquitoes can save us , and , after a long struggle , they do . That's about it . Characterisation is virtually non-existent , and the Nazis are treated basically as machine gun fodder . But it affords the same pleasure as an old ' Hotspur ' Annual . Some great British actors decorate this epic - Charles Gray , Robert Urquhart , Dinsdale Landen , McCallum himself , Nicky Henson , and there's a fleeting glimpse of future ' Doctor In The House ' star George Layton ! If all you want from a war movie is entertainment , and aren't too bothered by whether it sticks to the facts , give this one a whirl . I would sooner watch it than sit through all three bum-numbing hours of ' Saving Private Spielberg ' ( or whatever its called ) again .
401431	7743887	759867	9.0	" Four Away ! "	Albert makes a steak and kidney pie for tea . Alas , his culinary skills are hardly in the Delia Smith class , involving the use of a beer bottle as a rolling pin , and his dentures to make a pattern round the edge of the crust . Harold takes one bite , and encounters a tooth . It isn't his , either . Harold has purchased an old snooker table , and has it installed in the living room . It takes up so much room it is virtually impossible to have a decent game . Furthermore , Harold does not appear to be very good at it , potting the cue ball each time he attempts a shot . Albert , on the other hand , turns out to be a brilliant snooker player . As he loses game after game , Harold becomes angrier and angrier . Finally , he flips , and , after moving the table into the yard , insist they continue to play even in the middle of a storm . . . ' Pot Black ' was one of a batch of ' Steptoe ' episodes wiped by the B . B . C . in the ' 70's ( why , for heaven's sake ? ) , only to be later recovered , thanks to Ray Galton , who had the good sense to record them using an early form of V . C . R . Of all the recovered episodes , this is the one that I think suffers most from only existing in monochrome . The colours of the snooker balls cannot be seen , making the action around the table somewhat hard-going . What keeps it afloat are , as you would expect , the performances of the cast . As was the case with the later ' A Star Is Born ' , Harold embarks on a new hobby , only to be outclassed by his father . Funniest moment - faced with a difficult shot , Harold goes outside and leans in through the window !

Terry boasts in a school essay that his dad intends beating up Mr . Price in revenge for him giving evidence at the trial . When Price hears of this , he is terrified . But he need not be . Mr . Stringer wants to go straight , and has forgiven Mr . Price , much to Terry's disgust . Back at Fenn Street School , Mr . Cromwell is having problems with an new intercom system . Price sends for an electrician . When he arrives , his surly manner convinces Potter he is really Mr . Stringer . . . Tony Bilbow picks up a thread begun in ' False Alarms ' . Barry is worried that he will lose face in front of his friends , but in a clever ending Price sustains a mild electrical shock whilst poking about in a fuse box . 5C thinks he has gotten his come-uppance . The late Jack Watson , who plays the electrician , appeared in numerous television shows and films , including the role of the sergeant-major in ' The Wild Geese ' . Funniest moment - Price's futile attempts to hide from the man he thinks is Stringer .

His first attempt is a disaster ; a sexy young woman ( Clare Shenstone ) tries to seduce him by pretending to be ill so he can examine her . When her mother returns , she sees what looks like him trying to strangle her . His next port of call is no better ; the door is answered by a gay man who makes no secret of his interest in Upton . The next place he visits is inhabited by two dotty old ladies ( Betty Hare and May Warden ) . Upton is told he can have the room as soon as the previous occupant has left . He glances round and sees the bare feet of a corpse sticking out from under bedclothes . Panicking , he runs off to catch a bus . Things look up when he calls on Scottish widow Mrs . Muir ( Renee Houston ) . The room is spacious , cheap , and clean , everything he has been looking for . But he does not yet know there is a catch ; the other students are interested in it too . . . The fourth episode of ' House ' is pretty good , benefiting from a change of location ( not much of St . Swithins here ) , and a guest appearance from the talented Renee Houston , who was in one of my favourite movies : ' The Horse's Mouth ' starring Alec Guinness . Yutte Stensgaard , as ever , looks incredible , whether it be in the bath or stepping over the students in her night-clothes as they try to get some sleep . Funniest moment - the girl's mother searching Mike's belongings . Opening a box on top of the wardrobe , she shrieks as a skeleton falls out ! ( Although Graeme Garden was quoted as saying no gags from the movie were used , this one is similar to a famous scene where Dr . Simon Sparrow ( Dirk Bogarde ) gets on a bus with a package , which turns out to contain a skeleton . Perhaps Graeme thought the gag too good to leave out completely ) .

Loftus asks Dick and Mike to appear with him . Both are naturally thrilled . But the other students are unhappy about being left out and try to disrupt the proceedings , firstly by painting a clown's white face on Upton prior to taping , then Hooley masquerades as an 82 year old patient named Mrs . Crabtree in order to be interviewed . His performance ends abruptly when Upton tries to give him an enema . Dick has a disagreement with Loftus over a diagnosis which the cameras manage to capture . Things come to a head in the students ' bar when the crew catches them at their drunken worst . . . Its one of the oldest sitcom plots in the book . A film / T . V . crew turns up so people start showing off , but the broadcast item is not what was expected . A similar idea was later done in I . T . V . ' s other great medical sitcom - ' Only When I Laugh ' . But it works well enough here . The big twist is that the footage is for a damning indictment about the N . H . S . , and Loftus is naturally furious . Things To Look Out For : Graeme Garden , co-writer of this and many other ' Doctor ' episodes , appears briefly as a T . V . presenter . Another Thing To Look Out For : Dick mentions Dirk Bogarde , the star of the ' Doctor ' movies . Spot The Mistake : Jonathan Lynn slipping on spilt beer in the students ' bar . To everyone's credit , the scene continues as planned . Funniest moment - Hooley's impersonation of ' Mrs . Crabtree ' . His head wrapped in a shawl , and without make-up , Lynn is totally convincing as an old Irish woman .

' Two's Company ' was a kind of British ' Odd Couple ' ; it starred Elaine Stritch as bestselling American writer ' Dorothy McNab ' , with Donald Sinden as her snooty , sarcastic English butler ' Robert ' . There was an occasional ' battle of the sexes ' feel to the show , but mostly it was culture-clash humour . It was rare to find an I . T . V . sitcom in the ' 70's that featured wit , as opposed to belly laughs . Some of Robert's put-downs were priceless ; he told an Australian home-help in one episode : " Regrettably , we have no billy cans for you to drink from . But if you like , I can always arrange a small saucepan ! " . Complaining about the number of parked cars outside her home , Dorothy is told : " I'll get the police to tow them away , Madam ! " . Despite their constant bickering , there was an unspoken bound of affection between Dorothy and Robert . There had to be , or else she could easily have fired him . ' Two's Company ' , whilst never a big ratings hit for I . T . V . , was nevertheless popular , and lasted several seasons . Greg Smith , producer of the ' Confessions ' movies , wanted to make a big screen version with Lucille Ball replacing Elaine Stritch , to make it saleable to the American public . It never got made . However , the format was bought by U . S . television , and reworked as the dreadful ' The Two Of Us ' , with an utterly miscast Peter Cook in the Sinden role .
401481	7743887	52520	10.0	The Zone Where Awfully Weird Things Happen !	I am too young to have seen ' Twilight Zone ' on its original transmission . I came to it in 1983 when , to tie-in with the movie's release , the B . B . C . ran repeats of the first series . I watched not really knowing what to expect . It turned out to be a stylish science fiction anthology series , mostly written by Rod Serling ( who also presented ) , and starring top-drawer performers of the calibre of Burgess Meredith , Robert Redford , Fritz Weaver , and Charles Bronson . The premise was that the ' Twilight Zone ' was this mysterious place where anything could - and frequently did - happen . Ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in extraordinary situations , such as falling in love with robots , revisiting their childhoods , travelling back in time , or meeting aliens . That is my favourite kind of science fiction . The stories varied in quality , but most were worth watching and even the weaker ones had merit . The show came about because Serling had achieved great success with plays such as ' Requiem For A Heavyweight ' and ' Patterns ' , and wanted to do a science fiction series because he thought the genre would give him greater freedom to express his ideas without network interference . Gene Roddenberry later felt the same way when he devised ' Star Trek ' . Check out episodes such as ' The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street ' ( a wonderful study in paranoia ) , ' The Invaders ' ( containing a bravura performance by Agnes Moorehead ) , ' The After Hours ' , ' And When The Sky Was Opened ' , ' Nightmare At 20 , 000 Feet ' to see fantasy television at its best . Aliens and monsters were only a minor part of the show . The real star was Serling's imagination . The show's title and creepy theme tune ( by Marius Constant ) have both entered popular legend . You only have to hum a few bars of the latter and immediately everyone knows what show you are referring to . It ran for five seasons in all ( the fourth being a misguided attempt to upgrade the format to hour-long shows ) , and returned to television in the late ' 80's . As was later the case with the ' 90's update of ' Outer Limits ' , the new show was only a pale shadow of its predecessor . Incidentally , the title of this review came from a sketch on ' The Lenny Henry Show ' , shown on the B . B . C . in 1984 .
400930	7743887	83457	10.0	Wildly Funny	A middle-aged couple visit a posh restaurant . A sign reads : All Patrons Must Be Dressed For Dinner . A toffee-nosed waiter approaches , looks them up and down , before clicking his fingers . A tailor rushes over , takes the couple's measurements and leaves . " Your clothes will be ready next Tuesday . " , he tells them . A week later , the couple return to the restaurant wearing suits of armour . Elsewhere , a man in a sauna is astounded to see a London bobby stroll by , whistling . " Real peasouper , innit guv'nor ? " , he says amidst the steam . We cut to a newsroom . An anchorman sounds close to panic : " In Toyland , today , Mr . Potato Head went missing ! " . I've just quoted ( accurately , I hope ) three sketches from the Pythonesque comedy ' No Soap , Radio ' . It was a mixture of surreal sketches interspersed with more straightforward comedy narratives set in the ' Pelican Hotel ' . It should have attracted a loyal cult following , but didn't . Like ' Police Squad ! ' it was years ahead of its time . If anyone taped it at the time , congratulations !
400649	7743887	60980	10.0	First And Best Of The ' Matt Helm ' Movies	This was the last ' Matt Helm ' I saw ( the first being ' Murderers ' Row ) and I was surprised at how different it was compared to the others . Though a comedy , occasionally it gets rough . Take the hotel room scene where Matt is questioning Gail . Frustrated by her refusal to give a straight answer , he rips off her dress , leaving her fuming in her underwear . This scene is lifted almost verbatim from the novel , and isn't played for laughs . Paul Newman was originally offered the role of Matt , and one wonders if this wasn't a left-over from an early draft of the script . Its one of the reasons why ' The Silencers ' works so much better than the other films . We see something ( albeit only a little ) of the original character - a Government-sponsored assassin who'd kill in cold blood if he had to . Unfortunately , a change of writer and director for ' Murderers ' Row ' resulted in a shift in tone as the series lapsed into the quagmire of self-parody . Pity Oscar Saul didn't write any more ' Matt Helm ' scripts after this one !
400950	7743887	1231157	10.0	" Mind my leg ! "	Six months after the pilot episode for ' A Sharp Intake Of Breath ' was broadcast on I . T . V . on / 77 ( as part of ' The Sound Of Laughter ' anthology ) , a full series appeared , with David Jason once more playing ' Peter Barnes ' , middle-aged , happily married , a good man in an insane world . Replacing Patricia Brake as his wife Sheila was Jacqueline Clarke , best remembered for her appearances on the B . B . C . ' s ' Dave Allen At Large ' . ' Your Life In Their Hands ' is therefore the earliest surviving episode ( the pilot unfortunately having been wiped ) . It begins when Peter refuses to eat the scrambled eggs Sheila has made for his breakfast . She thinks he must be ill . But it is really because she is not a very good cook . At her insistence , he goes to his local surgery , which is comfortless , noisy , packed to capacity . Peter sits between a man ( Malcolm Storry ) whose foot is in plaster ( which he accidentally treads on - twice ) and Arthur Clegg ( Alun Armstrong ) , a flat-capped Northerner who blathers on about the state of the N . H . S . and this surgery in particular . " By the time you get to see a doctor in this place , you forget what it was you came in for ! " . Peter remembers to tell the receptionist ( Margaret Courtenay ) he is there . The buzzer on her window is so loud it nearly gives him a heart attack . Worse , her window is low so he has to speak to her while crouched . If he is not ill before he certainly must be now . . . Peter and Arthur swap doctors - the latter does not like the one he has been given - and immediately Peter sees why . The doctor ( Richard Wilson ) is so inept as to make ' Doc Morrissey ' from the ' Reggie Perrin ' series look like ' Dr . Kildare ' . . . . Good opening episode , and one that has not dated ( apart from a fleeting reference to Hughie Green's ' Opportunity Knocks ! ' ) too much . Surgeries look much the same today ( and are if anything worse , with television sets blaring away constantly ) . As the moaning ' Clegg ' , Armstrong put me a little in mind of ' Figgis ' from ' Only When I Laugh ' , while Richard Wilson's doctor could have been a distant relative of ' Thorpe ' from the same show . Funniest moment - dropping his stethoscope , the doctor bends to pick it up - and his back locks !
401369	7743887	70195	10.0	" Has The Swine Finished ? "	Frankie Howerd was enjoying a career renaissance in the early ' 70's , thanks to ' Up Pompeii ! ' , going on to star in three feature length spin-offs , the last of which was ' Up The Front ! ' in 1973 . Also that year he starred in this curio , a delightfully old fashioned comedy thriller in the mold of ' The Cat And The Canary ' . Howerd plays Foster Twelvetrees , a ham Shakespearian actor invited to give a performance at the house of the sinister Henderson family . Somewhere on the premises is buried treasure , and someone is determined to find it - even if it means killing the others . . . As you'd expect in a Frankie Howerd movie , the double entrendres come thick and fast . But the reason why I've given this unusual British film a rating is because it expertly mixes comedy with terror . The shot of a defaced poster of Twelvetrees just before the opening credits is accompanied by a blood-curdling scream - perfectly setting the tone for what follows . The scene in the snake house , the live puppet show , and Twelvetrees almost being butchered with a meat cleaver by an insane old woman are unusually strong by comedy standards . Credit for this must not only go to the underrated director Peter Sykes , but writers Clive Exton and Terry Nation . The latter had written for Tony Hancock a decade earlier , as well as creating the Daleks for ' Dr . Who ' so he knew all about scaring audiences . The presence of Ray Milland adds class to the film and marks it out from the other British comedies around at the time . My favourite supporting character , though , is played by Hugh Burden , muttering ' swine ! ' under his breath each time he claps eyes on Twelvetrees . While ' Up Pompeii ! ' and its off-shoots have been available on D . V . D . for some time , this film surprisingly isn't . I would unhesitatingly recommend it to people even if they weren't fans of Mr . Howerd .
401219	7743887	56777	10.0	" We are controlling transmission ! "	' The Outer Limits ' is often mentioned in the same breath as ' The Twilight Zone ' as one of the peaks of ' 60's television science fiction , and with good reason . The shows have a good deal in common , both are anthologies based partly on published fiction and original works . Both were made in glorious monochrome , feature top-drawer actors of the day , and still stand up well nearly fifty years later . ' Limits ' was the creation of Leslie Stevens , but the man who produced the first season ( and wrote many classic episodes ) is most frequently credited with its success . He was Joseph Stefano , writer of the screenplay of Hitchcock's ' Psycho ' . Stefano was responsible for establishing that each episode should have a ' bear ' - his nickname for a monster . He also hired Conrad Hall to create the show's distinctive lighting effects , while the special effects ( good for the time ) were by Projects Unlimited . It goes without saying that a modern audience would probably find the ' bears ' hilarious , but the series did not depend entirely for its impact on monsters . In ' Limits ' you will find something closely approximating the poetry of science fiction . Each episode opened with the picture blurring , while an announcer warned that the set was now under ' their ' control . It was a gimmick designed to invoke comparison with the famous Orson Welles ' War Of The Worlds ' radio broadcast ( written by Stevens , incidentally ) which conned many into believing a real alien invasion was underway . Stand-out stories include ' A Feasibility Study ' in which an American town is transported to an alien planet , ' The Zanti Misfits ' sees the arrival on Earth of hideous bug monsters with human-like faces , ' The Bellero Shield ' has a devious woman attempting to exploit alien technology for her own ends , ' The Man With The Power ' features Donald Pleasance as a man able to destroy anyone at will , in ' The Production & Decay Of Strange Particles ' ( great title ! ) atomic power triggers terrifying transformations in people , ' The Galaxy Being ' ( the show's pilot ) sees a radio ham accidentally making contact with a creature from the Andromeda constellation , ' The Forms Of Things Unknown ' has David McCallum as the inventor of a ' time tilting ' machine constructed out of hundreds of clocks . Somewhat out of place was ' The Hundred Days Of The Dragon ' , a conventional spy yarn in which the Red Chinese kill the President of The United States and replace him with an impostor , but it was gripping nevertheless . The impressive list of guest-stars included Barry Morse , Robert Culp , Carroll O'Connor , Leonard Nimoy , Robert Duvall , Sally Kellermann , Martin Landau , Sam Wanamaker , Warren Oates and Cliff Robertson . Special mention must be made of Dominic Frontiere , whose powerful music underlined the show's atmosphere of mystery and horror . ' Limits ' proved a surprise hit , and plans for a second season was laid . But when the network announced a change of time slot , Stefano resigned in protest . A new producer - Ben Brady - was appointed . Fans do not hold the second season in high regard , but a number of episodes , such as the two-parter ' The Inheritors ' , Harlan Ellison's ' Soldier ' and ' Demon With A Glass Hand ' , are as good as anything to be found in the previous year . Unfortunately , the new time-slot lost ' Limits ' viewers and it was abruptly cancelled . It appeared on I . T . V . ( usually in a late-night slot ) in the mid-'60's , and in 1980 , B . B . C . - 2 ran both seasons ( often jumbling up the episodes in haphazard fashion ) in one bumper run where it acquired a new audience . As a result of the success of ' The X-Files ' in the 1990's , ' Limits ' was resurrected by cable television . Some of the original shows - including ' I Robot ' , ' A Feasability Study ' and ' The Inheritors ' - were remade . The special effects were predictably better but alas little else was . The nudity it could have done well without . Luckily , both seasons of the original are out on D . V . D . and serve as a timely reminder of the greatness of ' 60's science fiction .
401422	7743887	56749	10.0	" Dad , I've got it wrong again ! "	I once accompanied my late uncle on a Saturday afternoon shopping trip . As we strolled around the centre , we spotted a smartly dressed man carrying a handbag ( they were briefly fashionable in the early ' 70's . In the ' To Alf A Grandson ' episode of ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , Mike ( Tony Booth ) is seen with one ) . I was prepared to say nothing , but my uncle came out with out with " Hello , Honky Tonk , how are you ? " . The man ignored the jibe , and carried on walking . He was probably used to it . A few shoppers laughed . I for one was deeply embarrassed . That was one of many catchphrases employed by the popular comedian Dick Emery , whose B . B . C . - 1 show was a fixture of Saturday night television for the best part of two decades . He was not strictly speaking an impressionist , rather than copy famous people , he had his own repertoire of outrageous comic characters , among them the buck-toothed ' The Reverend Chislet ' , a bespectacled spinster called ' Hettie ' whose determination to get a man knew no bounds , ' Ton-Up Boy ' , the lovable old codger ' James Maynard Kitchener Lampwick ' , ' Gaylord Screwsby ' , the bovver boy ( often accompanied by his similarly attired father , played by Roy Kinnear , who would try without success to give his son a masterclass in crime ) , the upper-class tramp ' College ' , camp-as-a-row-of-tents ' Clarence ' , and not forgetting sex-pot ' Mandy ' ( whose favourite saying was ' ooh you are awful , but I like you ! ' ) . Each week , these characters inhabited sketches usually written by John Warren and John Singer , beginning with a vox pop scene on film , in which a typically B . B . C . interviewer ( the late Gordon Clyde ) stopped passers-by to ask questions . Encountering Mandy , he wound up being pushed backwards into a hedge . It is impossible to make grand claims for Emery's show as being groundbreaking , but it was certainly amusing in a seaside postcard sort of way . A lot of hard work went into the show , what with Emery playing most of the roles , and viewers appreciated it . My favourite sketches featured him as ' Bert ' , an incompetent D . I . Y . man who invited his best friend Wol ( Reg Lye ) to his house whenever he wished to show off his latest creations . Once , he converted his coal cellar into a men's drinking club complete with bar and pool table ( which naturally fell apart when they tried to play on it ) . Another time Bert built his own film studio . Pat Coombs was often cast alongside the comedian , as his curler-headed neighbour . All together now : " Oo-er ! " . Emery's show attracted impressive guest-stars such as Kate O'Mara , Yootha Joyce , and David Jason . ' Lampwick ' , the old codger with the throaty chuckle , lived with his beloved daughter Lil ( Helen Fraser ) and her husband Ernie ( Victor Maddern ) , whom he did not get along with . So popular was he that the B . B . C . at one point contemplated giving him his own spin-off series . However , in 1981 , sensing that the format was becoming stale , Emery turned the show into ' Emery Presents ' , a six-part comedy thriller serial , of which two ( ' Legacy Of Murder ' and ' Jack Of Diamonds ' ) were made , the last of these transmitted posthumously as the star died in 1983 . We shall never know whether or not he would have stayed successful or been consigned to the dustbin of history along with so many other old school comics . In recent years , edited versions of his shows have been appearing at odd times on ' U . K . Drama Daytime ' on Sky T . V . It would be great to see his entire output on D . V . D . Emery may not have been groundbreaking , but was in his own way influential . Publicising his new B . B . C . series ' Harry Enfield's Television Programme ' in 1990 , the star admitted to having been a huge fan of Emery's when he was younger ( preferring him to ' Monty Python ' ) , and confessed that his show was a carbon-copy of his idol's . Emery may have been awful , but we liked him !
401416	7743887	78690	10.0	The Private Eye Who Became A Private Ear	' Shoestring ' is , in my view , the finest detective series the B . B . C . has ever made . The same production team were responsible for the later ( and vastly inferior ) ' Bergerac ' , but it had something the Jersey-based show lacked - Trevor Eve . In his pyjama jacket , Beatles-styled mop ( Eve had once played Paul McCartney on stage ) and sporting a fashionable moustache , the character could easily have crossed the line into parody ( he also had a habit of sketching the people he met in the course of cases ) , but Eve made Eddie warm and believable . Shoestring was originally a computer programmer who'd lost his job as the result of a nervous breakdown . His landlady , Erica Bayliss , worked in the police archives , and was a big help to him as she had access to confidential files . After a case involving a dead prostitute , Eddie was offered his own show by Radio West . Nowhere was Eve's acting ability more impressive than the scene in the second episode where Eddie suffers a fit of nerves whilst on air for the first time . Admittedly , his cases were small beer by comparison with U . S . detectives such as ' Philip Marlowe ' - religious cults , fake antiques dealers , punk rockers and dangerous Christmas toys - but the scripts were good and the cast performed them excellently . Special mention must go to George Fenton for his wonderful music , and Sid Sutton for his titles . ' Shoestring ' was a big hit ( Cary Grant was reputedly a fan ) , even though its second season clashed with ' The Professionals ' on I . T . V . , and should have run for five years at least . But it was not to be . Fearing typecasting , Trevor Eve quit after two . Due to complicated music rights issues , we are unlikely to see ' Shoestring ' on D . V . D . for the foreseeable future . A great shame .
401640	7743887	167701	10.0	Not All Remakes Are Lousy	In the autumn of 1991 , B . B . C-2 enjoyed surprising success with repeats of Gerry Anderson's ' Thunderbirds ' . They followed this up with ' Stingray ' and ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' , as well as several shows from the I . T . C . stable , including ' U . F . O . ' , ' The Champions ' and ' Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased ) . It was to tap into this vogue for retro action telly that inspired ' Fast Show ' creator Charlie Higson to revive the latter . He made several changes , such as turning Jeannie into Marty's girlfriend instead of his wife , and giving a ghostly world for Hopkirk to inhabit , presided over by the all-wise spirit mentor ' Wyvern ' ( Tom Baker ) . When I heard that Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer ( not my favourite comedians , I'm afraid ) had been cast as the leads , my blood ran cold . To make matters worse , they had ( so I felt ) been given the wrong roles - Reeves would have made a superb ' Jeff ' , while Mortimer should have been ' Marty ' . I was not really looking forward to the show . But I changed my mind after viewing the first episode . ' Drop Dead ' was loosely based on ' My Late Lamented Friend & Partner ' , but had more humour . Vic and Bob were better than expected , though not really actors as such . The gorgeous Emilia Fox more than made up for their shortcomings . She set the television alight as ' Jeannie ' . Guest-stars in the series included Sir Derek Jacobi , Charles Dance , Gareth Thomas , David Tennant , Hugh Laurie , and Jessica Stevenson . Thanks to the miracle of modern technology , the late Mike Pratt made a cameo in one episode ! I think what Higson really wanted to do was to essentially remake ' The Avengers ' . It explains why his version of ' Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased ) has the the same quirky surrealism as Steed and Mrs . Peel's adventures combined with a solid dose of supernatural fantasy . After an excellent first series , ' R & H ( Dec ) returned a year later , but the stories were slightly less amusing and inventive . Viewers lost interest and it was regrettably cancelled . However , it can now be seen as having paved the way for Russell T . Davies ' successful 2005 revival of ' Dr . Who ' .
401609	7743887	98781	10.0	" I'm Not Here ! "	Channel 4's ' Drop The Dead Donkey ' was a classic sitcom set in an office that managed to be funny without any assistance whatever from Ricky Gervais . It centred around the day-to-day goings on at ' GlobeLink ' , a television news station owned by the mysterious Sir Roysten Merchent . Staff fears that the news will be dumbed down are confirmed when Sir Royston hires as its new anchorwoman the pretty but vacuous Sally Smedley . Immediately she clashes with veteran anchorman Henry Davenport , who calls her " Tightarse " . Then there's the appalling Gus Hedges , fluent in two languages - English and rubbish . " Let me drop some descaler into your think-tank . " is one of his many favourite sayings . And Joy Merryweather , a woman so bad-tempered as to be borderline psychotic . The show won plaudits at the time for being recorded close to transmission , so as to enable the writers to be topical in their humour . Unfortunately , this has resulted in the show now looking dated . ' Drop ' had the good fortune to be running during the dark days of the last Conservative administration , when John Major was in Downing Strret . The endless procession of political mistakes , cash and sex scandals were a godsend to Hamilton and Jenkin . One episode cast Stephen Moore as a thinly-disguised Steve Norris . However , the final series went out after Tony Blair's 1997 election win , and came across as strangely muted . ' GlobeLink ' was finally closed down to make way for a home shopping channel . A mercy killing . ' Drop ' was immeasurably funnier than ' The Office ' , and why it is not as well regarded is a mystery .
401469	7743887	659318	10.0	A Game Of Cold War Cards	Russian scientist Professor Vasil is snatched from under the noses of the K . G . B . by Steed , Gambit , and Purdey ( with assistance from Department operative Roland ) . The agent in charge of the operation - Ivan Perov ( Peter Jeffrey ) - is so worried at the loss of face that he commits suicide . Or appears to . In fact he is alive and well and hopes to regain face by means of a programme he began in the 1950's called ' House Of Cards ' . Russian agents were carefully infiltrated into British society , and now Vasil plans on activating them ; firstly , to kill the New Avengers and then , to snatch back Professor Vasil . . . For many years , this was a ' lost ' New Avengers episode . Lost in the sense that one of its cast refused to allow it to be repeated , but thankfully this is no longer the case . Peter Jeffrey had played villains in two earlier ' Avengers ' episodes - as ' Max Prendergast ' in 1967's ' The Joker ' , and then as ' Monty Bristow ' in 1968's ' Game ' ( my favourite Linda Thorson episode ) . Like Peter Bowles and Peter Wyngarde he could always be relied on to give a good performance . The idea of ' sleepers ' being awakened and ordered to wreak havoc was also the premise of Walter Wager's novel ' Telefon ' , which was filmed the following year by Don Siegel , starring Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence . The use of playing cards as ' triggers ' may have been inspired by Richard Condon's book ' The Manchurian Candidate ' . As was the case with ' The Eagle's Nest ' , Brian Clemens avoided criticism of stereotyping an entire race by bringing in a good Russian , in this case Olga ( Ina Shriver ) . Interestingly , in Peter Cave's novelisation , it is revealed that Perov's sleepers were trained behind the Iron Curtain in a village made to resemble a British community - a neat reference to the ' Danger Man ' episode ' Colony Three ' . Comedy actors Frank Thornton and Derek Francis appear , the latter cast as Purdey's stepfather , a bishop , who when the going gets rough is able to apprehend bad guys by kicking them , just as his stepdaughter does . Steed gets one of his best moments in this episode ; when his girlfriend Jo ( Geraldine Moffatt ) is caught trying to poison him , she pleads for mercy , but he tells her that he long ago married a job , and has remained faithful ever since . In a nice touch , framed photographs of Cathy Gale , Emma Peel , and Tara King are seen prominently displayed in Steed's living room .
400974	7743887	659327	10.0	The Final Round	When I saw a repeat of ' The Avengers ' episode ' The Cybernauts ' late one Friday night in 1969 , I assumed automatically that the writer - Philip Levene - had ripped off Dr . Who's arch-enemy ' The Cybermen ' . I found out later on that the Cybernauts had come first . What are Cybernauts ? Robot men , silver in colour , able to home in and kill designated targets by means of snapping necks with one sweep of an arm . The eerie ' whooshing ' sound they made made them ideal for imitating in the playground . Though they moved with a lumbering gait , you definitely would not want a Cybernaut on your tail . They remain the best remembered of all ' Avengers ' baddies , and it is perplexing why Don Macpherson did not use them in his script for ' The Avengers ' movie . An army of Cybernauts on the rampage would surely have looked great on the big screen . After two encounters with John Steed and Mrs . Emma Peel , the Cybernauts went quiet for a few years , before resurfacing in the third episode of ' The New Avengers ' in 1976 . ' House Of Cards ' featured some nice nods to the past , but here we got an outright homage . Levene having died , the job of resurrecting the metal meanies went to Brian Clemens . At the start of the episode , Steed is celebrating his birthday in the company of Gambit and Purdey . A dying agent bursts in , and tells them that Department operative Felix Kane ( Robert Lang ) is really a double agent . The New Avengers lay in wait to catch him red-handed passing secrets to a Russian agent in a car park , but Kane makes a break for it , his car colliding with a petrol tanker . One year later , and a disfigured , wheelchair-bound Kane is plotting revenge . His henchman Malov ( Oscar Quitak ) picks up a newly-released convict called Frank Goff ( Robert Gillespie ) . Goff built the Cybernauts , working from the instructions of the deranged Professor Armstrong . Goff leads Kane to a secret storehouse of Cybernauts . The robots are made to live again . . . One note of bad continuity aside ( Goff was never in either of the earlier Cybernauts episodes ) , this is a cracking yarn , and as good as anything to be found in the original series . As another commentator has noted , the late Robert Lang makes a wonderful villain , neatly combining aspects of the earlier Cybernaut controllers , like Professor Armstrong , Kane is wheelchair-bound , and like Paul Beresford , thirsts for revenge . The director was Sidney Hayers , who helmed ' The Cybernauts ' way back in 1965 . Spot The Future Star - Gwen Taylor , later to star in ' Duty Free ' , is ' Dr . Marlow ' , a sexy scientist whom Steed tells to get in a cupboard . He is trying to save her from a Cybernaut , but she thinks he is being suggestive . Gambit and Purdey seem to be hitting it off beautifully in the scene where they discuss Steed's previous skirmish with the Cybernauts . Their quick-fire repartee is strongly reminiscent of Steed and Peel's . Amusingly , when this was repeated in 1990 by H . T . V . , the continuity announcer Eiry Palfrey must have misread the ' T . V . Times ' synopsis because she said : " In tonight's New Avengers , the Cybernauts are back and the ghost of Emma Peel appears ! " . Eh ?
400644	7743887	68065	10.0	Exit Upton , Re-Enter Waring	With Barry Evans out of the ' Doctor ' series , it hit crisis point . So popular was he that to have recast the role of ' Upton ' would have been a mistake . Humphrey Barclay chose instead to bring back the cheeky ' Duncan Waring ' - not seen since ' In The House ' - played by the late , much-missed Robin Nedwell . His absence was explained by his being in America , studying medicine ( and getting up to naughty business as the episode ' Honey Lamb ' would make abundantly clear ) . Upton was said to have joined the Merchant Navy to escape the amorous advances of Nurse Willett , to whom he had drunkenly proposed . He was never seen again and remained virtually forgotten until the opening episode of ' Doctor At The Top ' twenty years later . It didn't take long for Waring to engender the same level of affection as his predecessor . He was more of an extrovert ( only an extrovert would wear those hideous bow-ties ! ) and Nedwell was particularly adept at physical comedy . The early episodes gave him a steady girlfriend in the shape of Nurse Sandra Crumpton , played by Sammie Winmill , of ' The Tomorrow People ' fame , but she was dropped after a handful of episodes , along with Duncan's mother and father . Richard O'Sullivan had proved popular as slimy ' Bingham ' and so was granted the honour of appearing in the opening titles along with the others . Inside Duncan's pacing outline Lawrence can be seen reacting in horror as the ambulance he is in collides head-on with another , carrying Dick Stuart-Clark . ' In Charge ' became the first ' Doctor ' series to earn a two-page strip in the children's comic ' Look-In ' . Angus P . Allan's stories were true to the spirit of the original , although the nurse-chasing and boozing were conspicuously absent ! I rate this as the best of the ' Doctor ' series , mainly because of the combined team of Nedwell , Davies , Layton , O'Sullivan and Clark and the superb scripts by , amongst others , Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie ( ' The Black & White Medical Show ' excepted ! ) . Sadly , they left after the first series to concentrate on ' The Goodies ' . Future ' Grange Hill ' and ' Brookside ' creator Phil Redmond was one of their replacements . Two story arcs occurred in the first series - Loftus ' quest for a knighthood and Bingham courting and marrying one of Duncan's old flames - the ghastly ' Dr . Mary Parsons ' ( Helen Fraser ) , who refers to him as ' Bidger-Badger ! ' and Duncan as ' Dunky ' ! Incidentally , a young Tony Robinson ( ' Baldrick ' from ' Blackadder ' ) appears in the episodes ' Amazing Grace ' and ' The Epidemic ' . Funniest episode - ' Honeymoon Special ' Watch it and cry laughing !
401020	7743887	52911	10.0	One Of The Greatest British Films Ever !	Its no secret that the Boulting Brothers were no lovers of trade unions , and this is reflected in their film ' I'm All Right Jack ' which portrays union men as either lazy or stupid . Often overlooked is the fact that its also extremely critical of capitalists too . When Ian Carmichael's wonderfully naive ' Stanley Windrush ' discovers he's been used as a pawn by greedy bosses , he loses his rag , denouncing the system as corrupt . But its Peter Sellers ' ' Fred Kite ' whom everyone remembers ; with his short hair , Hitler-like moustache , and ignorance of the very political doctrine he espouses , he's a marvellous comic creation . The film also takes swipes at the media , the world of advertising , and the changing moral climate in ' 50's Britain . If I could choose one film to put in a time capsule to epitomise that era , this would be it . The fact that after forty years , the phrase ' I'm All Right Jack ' is still used as shorthand for naked greed is testimony to the film's enduring appeal .
401642	7743887	436992	10.0	" Do You Wanna Come With Me ? ! "	2005 will go down in ' Dr . Who ' history as its most incredible year . Everything seemed to click ; a first-rate new Doctor and companion , big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ) , major awards , critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks ' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced . But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell , quitting after just one series . It looked like the honeymoon was over . Luckily , the public appears to have embraced his successor , the excellent David Tennant . On top of this the show boasts fine S . F . X . , like the spaceship crashing into ' Big Ben ' in ' Aliens Of London ' and superb story lines such as ' Tooth & Claw ' , ' Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday ' . The new ' Dr . Who ' is basically the same as the old , only updated for the 21st century . Some fans have accused Russell T . Davies of ' ruining ' the show . They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along .
400973	7743887	679174	10.0	" I will not make any deals with you . I've resigned ! "	As I write this , a remake of the television classic ' The Prisoner ' is nearing completion . Those of us who remember the original view the prospect with some trepidation . How many great movies / T . V . series have had their reputations sullied by remakes ? Too many to name . Even the B . B . C . have gotten in on the act with ' Survivors ' , loosely based on Terry Nation's classic show . With ' The Prisoner ' , its more worrying because the opportunities for failure are greater . Have they chosen the right man to replace Patrick McGoohan ? Will the new location work out ? Will the plots be dumbed down ? Ah well , questions are a burden to others as someone once said , so let us wait and see . The first episode of the original was aptly titled ' Arrival ' , and it was written by George Markstein and David Tomblin . An unnamed British secret agent resigns , and is swiftly abducted by unknown forces . He wakes up in a strange place known only as ' The Village ' . Here other ex-agents have been incarcerated and are forced to live out their lives though with numbers in place of their names . Our hero finds himself lumbered with the number Six . Attempts to escape from The Village usually end in failure . strange balloon-like creatures called ' Rovers ' emerge from the sea , roaring like demented lions , to pursue and in some cases suffocate would-be runaways . Number Six is told by the Chairman of The Village - Number Two - that he has only a short time to willingly co-operate , such as stating his reason for resigning , and that if he fails to do so , the information will be forcibly extracted from his mind . The local hospital is a front for a brainwashing centre . Number Six witnesses first-hand the horror of seeing people reduced to gibbering imbeciles . The first part of ' Arrival ' is devoted to setting up the premise of the show . The beautiful Portmeirion location contrasts magnificently with the cold and clinical interiors . Patrick McGoohan is , as you would expect , simply brilliant . His performance encompasses anger , confusion , wry amusement , and defiance . ' Number Two ' is initially played by the late Guy Doleman ( ' Colonel Ross ' in Michael Caine's ' Harry Palmer ' films ) but half-way through the episode another actor - George Baker - assumes the role . Doleman's ' Number Two ' is charming and polite , but Baker's is an altogether more unpleasant character . On a sad note , Virginia Maskell , who plays ' The Woman ' , committed suicide a short time after this was broadcast . The second part deals with an attempt by Number Six to escape from The Village in a helicopter . Having managed to obtain an electro-pass from a woman who was emotionally attached to an old colleague called ' Cobb ' ( Paul Eddington ) , Number Six flies off , but as this is only the first episode it is reasonable to assume he does not get far . ' Arrival ' presents us with a world where nothing is what it seems and where no-one can be trusted . Even the maps on sale in The Village shop do not tell the truth . On arriving in The Village , Number Six repeatedly bumps into the same man ( Oliver MacGreevy ) in different guises . No matter what Number Six does or where he goes , he always seems to find himself right back where he started . I expect the new version to simplify the original's complexities , meaning it will probably not gain a cult following nor be the subject of discussion in thirty years ' time . Superbly written , acted , edited , and directed , ' Arrival ' is one of the greatest openings to a television series ever . If you only decide to watch one episode of ' The Prisoner ' , make it this one . Be Seeing You !
401257	7743887	679188	10.0	Number Six Times Two	Patrick McGoohan , my favourite actor , died earlier this week ( shame on B . B . C . - 1's ' Six O'Clock News ' and I . T . N . for failing to mention this . If it had been Russell Brand it probably would have been the lead item ) , so I thought I'd pay small tribute by looking at an episode of his most famous creation - ' The Prisoner ' T . V . series . I won't spell out the plot in great detail because it would be unfair to anyone viewing it for the first time . Also , it is hard to do ! It begins in Number Six's cottage , where he is assisting a young woman called Alison ( Jane Merrow ) who has telepathic abilities . As he picks out Xener cards , she is able to correctly identify each one . She puts it down to a psychic bond between them . A accident with a soda syphon leaves him with a bruised thumbnail . We do not know it yet but that bruise - and her photograph of it - will be important later on . As she leaves , the scene switches to The Village's control room , where Number Two ( Anton Rodgers ) commences the latest plot to break The Prisoner and learn the reason for his resignation . A light over the sleeping Prisoner's head pulsates , and medics carry him off to the hospital . He is there for an undetermined period , long enough for him to grown a moustache anyway , also his hair is dyed black , and he undergoes electric shock treatment to make him left-handed instead of right . When he awakens , he is not in his usual dwelling , and when he looks in a mirror sees his appearance has been altered . At the Green Dome , Number Two addresses him as ' Number Twelve ' , and acts as though he is on his side . Number Six is given his ' orders ' - to break himself ! After having his hair dyed back to its original colour and the moustache shaved , Number Six returns to his original dwelling . Who should be in residence but . . . Number Six ? Confused ? So apparently was director Pat Jackson when he read the script back in 1966 . To his credit , his confusion is not apparent . The complex plan to make The Prisoner doubt his identity almost works . Following a lengthy session with the double in which both men sword fence , shoot guns , and box , ironically it is Alison who provides the final damning proof by establishing her psychic bond with the double . It is all a put-up job though , and later she regrets her decision to co-operate with The Village . ' Schizoid Man ' is one of the finest episodes of the series , intriguing throughout , boasting a tour-de-force performance from McGoohan . When the double lays in wait for Number Six with a nerve gas gun , the actor excludes the charming arrogance he would bring later to his many villainous roles , such as ' Roger Devereau ' in ' Silver Streak ' . The scene where Number Six makes himself right-handed again is powerful indeed . Anton Rodgers is the youngest ' Number Two ' seen in the show so far , playing him not as a ruthless interrogator but a seemingly-harmless bureaucrat : " Here I am , stuck in Admin ! " . However , when Number Six fails the mind-reading test with Alison , you will see Number Two smirking at The Prisoner's discomfiture . Not so nice after all . Terence Feely's script so impressed McGoohan the writer was invited to join the board of directors at Everyman Films - the company that made the series . It is a superbly plotted show , with a strong ending , even if Number Six's carelessness is ultimately a little hard to swallow , given that earlier episodes established him as a tricky character to outwit . The new ' Prisoner ' has got an awful lot to live up to . If only one episode is half as good as this , I will be happy . But no matter how superior the new show's special effects might or might not be , you cannot replace McGoohan . He was ' The Prisoner ' . Be Seeing You , Patrick .
401339	7743887	296429	10.0	Baxter Brilliance !	When producer / director David Bell defected to L . W . T . in 1972 , star Stanley Baxter followed suit . ' Picture ' had a brief run ( only four episodes were made ) but provided the Scottish comedian with the launching pad for those spectacular one-hour shows for which he is best remembered . It comprised spoofs of popular television shows of the day such as ' Whicker's World ' , ' Braden's Week ' , ' Cinema ' and ' The Benny Hill Show ' - all were sent up something rotten . ' Scars On Sunday ' , to give an example , had Stanley as ' Jest Fate ' , an accurate lampoon of the late Jess ' Bishop ' Yates . The same sketch featured Stanley as Eartha Kitt and Harry Secombe ! ' Elfin Nolan - Supertramp ' was an effective mickey-take of portentous rock documentaries such as those directed by Tony Palmer . Any resemblance between the character and the late Marc Bolan was presumably coincidental . ' Peculiar Girl ' had Stanley as Barbra Streisand from the film ' Funny Girl ' . Miming to ' Don't Reign On My Parade ' , Stanley was to be seen hijacking a bus , riding various forms of transport ( such as a penny farthing bicycle , tricycle and roller skates ) and zooming over London on a broomstick . Anyone who thinks Stanley was not a good impressionist needs their head examined . He did not just take off politicians and minor celebrities , but went for big-name stars such as Joan Crawford , Bette Davis , Clark Gable and Katherine Hepburn . He was the first comedian to impersonate The Queen ! I have seen Rich Little and he is just not in the same class . Stanley had strong support from the brilliant writer Ken Hoare and director David Bell . Of course some sketches have not aged very well ( the parody of Ken Russell's ' The Music Lovers ' comes to mind ) mainly because memories of the originals have faded . But Stanley's genius remains undiminished with the passage of time . Watch and marvel that comedy of this calibre ever got made , much less transmitted .
401133	7743887	59963	10.0	" So Clever But Oh So Vulnerable "	' Adam Adamant Lives ! ' was another innovative and inventive adventure series from the creative mind of Sydney Newman ( his others include ' The Avengers ' and ' Dr . Who ' ) . Having been placed in suspended animation by his arch-enemy ' The Face ' , the dashing Edwardian hero Adam Adamant ( Gerald Harper ) was found and revived in 1966 , where he , aided and abetted by his sidekicks - the wide-eyed Mod Georgina Jones and ' Jeeves'-like butler William Simms , battled evil in the modern world . Verity Lambert produced , the scripts were by amongst others Brian Clemens and Tony Williamson . Ridley Scott directed several episodes . Being a video-taped B . B . C . production , it stood no chance of competing with the more expensive filmed shows made by I . T . C . , but worked well enough on its own terms . Gerald Harper cut a dash as the caped Adamant , sword stick forever at the ready . The first season outperformed ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' in the ratings in Britain . In the second year , Peter Ducrow was reintroduced as ' The Face ' . Many episodes no longer exist , alas , but those that do are splendidly entertaining and amusing . ( To the unnamed author of the comment entitled ' First Episode ' , I think that you ought to have watched it all the way to the end before submitting your damning review . You do not seem to have grasped that this was a fantasy adventure show , and as such was not intended to be taken seriously . )
401621	7743887	59966	10.0	Alias The Baron	I . T . C . made ' The Baron ' as a follow-up to ' The Saint ' series starring Roger Moore . Terry Nation , Dennis Spooner and Brian Clemens ignored John Creasey's books and invented wholly original plots . Some such as ' Storm Warning / The Island ' had a strong ' U . N . C . L . E . / Avengers ' flavour . The casting of Steve Forrest as ' John Mannering ' worked because there were no previous screen incarnations to judge him by . As per the books , Mannering owned an antiques shop in London , but was now a part-time agent for British Intelligence , headed by John Templeton-Greene ( Colin Gordon ) , hence the scope of the plots ran from crime to espionage to mystery . The presence of luscious Sue Lloyd ( as ' Cordelia ' ) further distanced the show from the Moore series . While ' The Baron ' failed to replicate the success of ' The Saint ' in the U . S . A . , it remains an enormously entertaining show and the only screen incarnation of the character to date . It also has one of Edwin Astley's best theme tunes !
401039	7743887	536411	10.0	" There'a hold-up in the Bronx . . . "	The first episode of the brilliant American sitcom ' Car 54 Where Are You ? ' which did for the N . Y . P . D . what ' Sergeant Bilko ' did for the Army . Incompetent cops Toody and Muldoon spend their free days fishing without much success . They fantasise about going to sea in an expensive boat and catching a swordfish . O'Hara , one of their colleagues at the 53rd Precinct , has just such a boat , or rather his brother-in-law has , so they ask him to let them come along on their next trip . He flatly refuses . To get him to change his mind , they embark on a campaign of ' niceness ' - filling in his police reports , sending him flowers ( causing his wife to suspect him of having an affair ) and sucking up to him in general . Irritated and annoyed , O'Hara relents . But then they cannot get time off work to go on their proposed fishing trip , hence they ask other cops to rearrange their assigned schedules . Soon the duty roster board resembles a snakes and ladders game as the changes are incorporated . When the matter finally appears settled , more trouble looms . Toody and Muldoon nab a quick-tempered motorist , Conroy , for jumping a red light . He admits his guilt , and asks for a ticket so he can go on his way . But if they comply with his request , they will have to go to court the next day and won't be free to go fishing , so they refuse . The driver insists they and no-one else give him a ticket . A fierce row develops . Bystanders look on in bemusement , as more and more cops join the fray . . . This was Nat Hiken's follow-up to the massively successful ' The Phil Silvers Show ' , and is every bit as good , and occasionally better . ' Toody ' is portrayed by ' Bilko ' semi-regular Joe E . Ross , who looks like Ernest Borgnine on a bad day . The character is not far removed from the one he played on that earlier show - ' Private Ritzik ' . As well as exclaiming " oooh ! oooh ! " every time he has an idea , he also has a domineering wife ( Beatrice Pons played both ' Emma Ritzik ' and ' Lucille Toody ' ) . Tall , gangling Fred Gwynne , a . k . a . ' Muldoon ' , was in two episodes of ' Bilko ' as ' Private Honergan ' , but is more famous as ' Herman ' from ' The Munsters ' . This script , like the best of ' Bilko ' , begins with a basic premise . Lesser writers might have stretched it to fill the entire half-hour , but Hiken gets it over with quickly and moves on , making all kind of unexpected detours , resulting in comedic chaos . Superb dialogue throughout . Funniest moment - the angry confrontation between Toody , Muldoon and the motorist must rank as one of the funniest scenes in any show and surely must have inspired John Cleese to create the legendary ' Fire Drill ' sequence in ' Fawlty Towers ' ! As the last cop joins in the mêlée , he comments : " A good thing he wasn't speeding or we'd have had to call in The National Guard ! " . A sheer delight !
400754	7743887	710088	10.0	" What's it like for crumpet ? "	Harold is dating the very sexy Marcia Wigley ( Lynn Farleigh ) , who describes both herself and her husband as ' swingers ' , even though he cannot do much swinging as he is currently in jail . They both want to go up to Harold's room , but Albert is making a racket by mending old shoes . Finally , believing the old man to be asleep , they both creep upstairs . Harold's lust is dampened as Marcia screams on catching sight of a bed-bug . After she flees the house , Harold resolves to get a new bed . . . I doubt whether a plot like this would have been used in the original series - well , at least , Harold's true intention for the bed would not have been so graphically depicted . I recall on ' Points Of View ' viewers complaining about what they perceived to be a ' coarsening ' of the series ' humour , when all that had happened was that it had moved with the times . Great bed shop scene , with Harold trying to impress the camp salesman ( Angus Mackay ) by using French , anticipating ' Del Boy Trotter ' of ' Only Fools & Horses ' by a few years . As soon as Harold and Albert walk in , the salesman tells them : " The betting shop's next door ! " . When the old man goes to light a Turkish fag , he almost chokes . Then he leaves horse dung on one of the beds . Water beds were fashionable around that time , though only for the well-off . Albert's initial contempt turns to admiration . " You needn't worry about bed bugs . . . it'll drown the little bleeders ! " . Lynn Farleigh is very good as the willing ' Marcia ' . She is still acting I believe . Good for her . Funniest moment - Harold and Marcia sweeping romantically into each other's arms , falling onto the water bed , which then bursts open ! A classic Steptoe moment . Second funniest moment - Blink and you will miss it but , over the end credits , Harold - looking like Jack Nicholson's axe man from ' The Shining ' - can be seen trying to break down the door to Albert's room while the old man cowers in terror under the mattress ! We can but wonder what happened next . . .
401664	7743887	710129	10.0	" What kind of fool am I ? "	Albert is confined to bed with back trouble . A doctor ( Robert James ) has prescribed plenty of rest . Naturally the old man takes advantage of the situation by living like a king , with poor old Harold not only cleaning the house , shopping , changing library books , preparing and taking meals upstairs , but also being expected to go totting as well . When he gets the time . It all comes to a head when Harold lets his feelings be known . Of course he calms down eventually . Attempting to change channels on the T . V . set while Harold is out , the old man's slipped disc suddenly rights itself . Instead of telling Harold this , he continues to treat him like a slave . Harold notices his favourite liquorice allsorts - the pink ones - have gone missing , also cans of beer have been drunk . He puts two and two together , and plots a terrible revenge on his malingering father . . . A superb episode from the final run of ' Steptoe & Son ' . Poor Harold is really pushed to the limit here , anyone who has had to look after a sick relative will know exactly how he feels . His line ' we'll manage . . . we always do ' is wonderfully touching . The old man plays the sympathy card relentlessly , so much so that in spite of his condition you do not feel at all sorry for him . His comeuppance , when it comes , is eminently satisfying . Robert James , who plays ' The Doctor ' , was ' Lesterson ' in Patrick Troughton's ' Dr . Who ' debut in 1966 : ' The Power Of The Daleks ' . Funniest moment - Harold staying out of sight while his Dad comes downstairs and steals the liquorice allsorts . He then creeps up behind him and delivers an imaginary kick to his rear ! Great stuff .
401145	7743887	57798	10.0	" F . S . - 1 To Seaview ! "	Created by Irwin Allen , ' Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea ' was a long-running science fiction series based on the hit Twentieth Century Fox movie of the same name . Basically , it told of the colourful exploits of the Seaview , the world's most technologically advanced submarine , commanded by Captain Lee Crane and created by Admiral Harriman Nelson ( Rtd . ) of ' The Nelson Institute Of Marine Research ' . Each week , the sub would save the world either from saboteurs , aliens or monsters . David Hedison and the late Richard Basehart brought more to the characters than was ever there on paper . Four seasons were produced - of which the first was the best - and the show was a favourite of mine when I was a boy . Rather than regurgitate the show's well-documented history , however , I want to use this review to recount a personal memory . In the early ' 90's , Britain's Channel 4 announced that it had purchased the entire run , and planned to screen it on Sunday afternoons in the slot vacated by ' Lost In Space ' . I was beside myself with excitement . The last reruns of ' Voyage ' ( as it shall henceforth be referred to ) were back in the early ' 80's , and took the form of sporadic showings of Season 2 and 3 stories such as ' The Mechanical Man ' and ' The Lost Bomb ' ( I'm referring to the H . T . V . screenings . Other regions may have had different ones ) . Particularly exciting was the news that the run included the first season , which I had never before seen . Being black and white effectively precluded it from a reshowing in the colour crazy ' 70's . So in 1990 , the Seaview set sail again . But there was a problem . In my neck of the woods , we had S4C - the Welsh fourth channel - and they commenced the run several weeks behind Channel 4 . Which meant that when English viewers got onto the colour episodes , we were still watching the monochrome ones . Nothing wrong with that , you may think . I was grateful to be seeing ' Voyage ' at all . But then something dreadful happened . The Gulf War , to be precise . Someone at Channel 4 realised that the episode ' The Magnus Beam ' was too close to what was happening in the real world - set in the Middle East , it concerned a madman who wanted to start World War Three by capturing U . S . spy planes , and decided it was not suitable for screening at that time . It was shelved - along with ' The Blizzard Makers ' , whose only crime it seems was to mention The Gulf Stream several times . The run carried on without them . After the war ended , Channel 4 showed the episodes . All seemed well . Then S4C made a staggering blunder . Following ' The Magnus Beam ' , they were to have followed C4's lead by screening ' The Blizzard Makers ' before recommencing the normal order . But they didn't . Instead they put on ' Leviathan ' , the seventh episode of Season 2 ! I was horrified . The station had managed to omit a dozen episodes ( six from the first year , six from the second ) . Any hope I had of building a complete library of ' Voyage ' episodes went straight out the window . Amongst the ' lost ' stories were classics like ' Jonah & The Whale ' and ' And Five Of Us Are Left ' . It would be like a comprehensive ' Star Trek ' season forgetting to include ' The City On The Edge Of Forever ' and ' Amok Time ' . Enraged , I fired off a letter to S4C , hoping to obtain an explanation for this act of crass stupidity . I eventually got a reply . The unsigned letter claimed that the decision to skip twelve episodes was Channel 4's , insisting that the S4C transmissions should harmonise with theirs . I didn't buy it . For one thing , they were still a week behind , and secondly , why would an English television station care what was being shown in Wales ? ' The Waltons ' was also being rerun at the same time , and S4C's reverential treatment of ' John-Boy ' and company contrasted sharply with its unmistakable contempt for ' Voyage ' . The letter writer concluded by inviting me to take the matter up with Channel 4 . In other words , they were passing the buck . They had messed up , and were refusing to even say sorry . I tossed the letter in the bin . S4C weren't finished with ' Voyage ' either . A screening of the Season 3 episode ' The Death Watch ' was plagued by so many technical problems it rendered the plot incomprehensible . A year later , ' Cave Of The Dead ' was displaced by coverage of the Urdd Eisteddfod , never to be rescheduled . None of this would have mattered had the series been available on V . H . S . at the time . It wasn't . I had to wait fourteen years to see the missing twelve , when ' Voyage ' was rerun on the Sky satellite channel ' F . X . 289 ' ' . And then they only ran the first two seasons . If you think the S4C debacle still rankles with me after all these years , you'd be right . My ' Voyage ' collection is still missing two episodes at the time of writing . Despite its popularity , Channel 4 have not shown the slightest interest in bringing it back . Admiral Nelson and Captain Crane faced many untold dangers over the years , but one peril even they could not overcome was the general incompetence of television programme planners .

Disguised as poor people ( Bill is made up to look like a baby ) , they visit an estate agent , whose house prices rise with each passing second . After being conned out of their life savings , they decide to build a disused railway station . . . Cracking episode which launched ' The Goodies ' third series . Joe Melia , who plays a double role as the builder and the estate agent , will forever be remembered as ' Mr . Prosser ' from the television version of ' The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy . His sexy secretary , Miss Lushboosie , is played by Julie Desmond - ' the girl with the biggest tits ' in the famous Monty Python ' Summarise Proust ' sketch . Two fantastic film sequences - the Goodies building their new offices ( Bill uses a pneumatic drill as a pogo stick at one point ) and the stunning finale in which our heroes are menaced by sentient bulldozers - make this a real treat for comedy fans .

I took to it straight away , as did most of my generation . People who think ' The League Of Gentlemen ' are doing anything new should be made to watch this ; it was unusually dark by the standards of U . S . television . Amusing though the Addams family undeniably are , they nevertheless possess a vaguely threatening quality . John Astin headed up the cast as ' Gomez Addams ' , whose idea of fun is watching toy trains crash . The late Carolyn Jones was sublime as ' Morticia ' , while former child star Jackie Coogan lit up the screen when he put light bulbs in his mouth as ' Uncle Fester ' . Ted Cassidy made a huge impact as ' Lurch ' , despite having very little to say . ' The Addams Family ' debuted on U . S . television at the same time as ' The Munsters ' , but this is my favourite . Once you've heard that insufferably catchy Vic Mizzy theme , you just can't get it out of your head !
401249	7743887	398106	10.0	" Are you going to Tossa ? "	The one-off comedy special by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson that inspired the series ' Dawsons Weekly ' . Les wants to see the world . Turning up at a travel agents , he creates trouble by insisting he bring his bike indoors . The agent ( Frank Thornton ) is so keen to get rid of him he offers a list of package holidays - all are too expensive for Les . He only has £22 . He buys a ticket to fly to Tossa del Mar courtesy of the ' Kut-Price Holidays Ltd ' group . Les senses he is in for trouble when he turns up at Leeds Airport and finds the company's office located in a tent near the runway . Doris ( Mollie Sugden ) says the plane cannot take-off because the company has not sold enough tickets . Luckily , a few more holiday-makers turn up . Les is told he is carrying too much weight and has to leave most of his luggage behind . A van ferries the passengers to an ancient cargo plane , festooned with football graffiti . Inside the passengers are crowded together like cattle . The stewardess ( Patricia Hayes ) sells Les a raffle ticket . The lucky winner will receive a meal . The plane eventually takes off - albeit reluctantly . " For a moment there , I thought we were travelling by road ! " , says Les . His fellow passenger is ' Peregrine ' ( Roy Barrowclough ) , a gay coal-miner . As soon as they meet , he asks him : " Are you going to Tossa ? " . The passengers are told to get off when they get to the Pyrenees , as a bus will take them around the other side , where they will get back on the plane . Worse , the passengers are forced to hand over loose change for an unexpected refuelling . Les is skint and he has not even got there yet ! Bad package holidays were also the theme of the film ' Carry On Abroad ' in 1972 and the B . B . C . special ' Marty Abroad ' ( starring Marty Feldman ) in 1971 . Benny Hill also did a very good silent sketch on the same subject . Thanks to a terrific Galton / Simpson script and top-notch playing from all concerned , particularly Dawson and Barrowclough , this one is comedy gold from start to finish . Patricia Hayes is , as always , a joy to watch . Funniest moment - Les emerging from a toilet . He asks the stewardess where they are . " Over Luton ! " , she replies . " Good , I never went down well there ! " , says Les , before going back to pull the chain !
401576	7743887	562879	10.0	The Time Lord Who Fell To Earth !	A swarm of fifty meteorites lands in Southern England . Poacher Sam Seeley digs one up . It pulsates and emits an unearthly trilling sound . The meteorites are not the only visitors from space that day . The Tardis lands nearby , and an ill-looking Doctor steps out , before collapsing . Meanwhile , boffin Liz Shaw is whisked away from Cambridge to a secret meeting with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of U . N . I . T ( United Nations Intelligence Taskforce ) . The organisation was set up to protect Earth from attacks by creatures from outer space . Man's attempts at space exploration have attracted attention apparently . He tells her that on the two previous alien invasion attempts , Earth was saved by a strange man known only as ' The Doctor ' . The Doctor has been taken to a country hospital , and appears to be in a coma . His unusual physiognomy ( two hearts , no known blood group ) confound the medical staff . . . No sooner had the ' 70's begun than ' Dr . Who ' was back on our screens , this time with a new leading man ( Jon Pertwee ) and in colour ( I didn't upgrade until 1974 . hence was unable to appreciate the new show in this medium ) . Pertwee was mainly known for his comedy roles , on the radio ( ' The Navy Lark ' ) and films such as ' Carry On Cowboy ' and ' The Ladies Who Do ' , so to see him as everyone's favourite Time Lord came as quite a shock . He confounded expectations by playing the role straight , almost like an Edwardian version of James Bond , who in his frilly shirt , smoking jacket and cape made a dapper contrast to his scruffily attired predecessor , Patrick Troughton . He spends most of the first episode in bed , recovering briefly to talk to Lethbridge-Stewart . His character remained an unknown quantity right up to the end credits . As Liz Shaw , Caroline John was a radical departure from the ' Who ' girls of the past , being both intelligent and independent . She would not have seemed out of place in ' Doomwatch ' . This was Nicholas Courtney's third appearance as ' Lethbridge-Stewart ' ; we first saw him ( as a Colonel ' ) in ' The Web Of Fear ' , then promoted to ' Brigadier ' in ' The Invasion ' . He was established as a regular character in this story . Exiled to Earth , the Doctor had no place in society , and U . N . I . T . provided him with a place to work in return for his becoming their Scientific Adviser . Had the internet existed in 1970 , the ' Dr . Who ' forums of the day would doubtless have seethed with outrage over the reformatting . The thing is , it worked . The ' cosmic nomad ' format had been in place since 1963 and was in need of a temporary rest . Needless to say , within a few years , it would be revived . The villains of this story - the Autons - are glimpsed only briefly , but when revealed in all their plastic glory terrified a whole generation of British children ( myself included ) . In 2005 , Russell T . Davies resurrected ' Dr . Who ' , using the Autons in his first script - ' Rose ' . He was right to do so because the concept - animated plastic mannequins - is a frightening one even now . Due to industrial action , the first Pertwee adventure had to be shot entirely on film , another thing that worked in its favour . It came across as slicker and looking more like an adult show than a children's one , as if ' Dr . Who ' was now being made by I . T . C instead of the B . B . C . This was Robert Holmes ' third ' Who ' script , his others being ' The Krotons ' and ' The Space Pirates ' . The new format and doctor seemed to do him the power of good . ' Spearhead ' was the first of several Holmes-scripted classics . It got ' 70's ' Who ' off to a flying start .
401648	7743887	296867	10.0	" Why Can't We Cancel Christmas ? "	Easily the best of Stanley Baxter's legendary Christmas shows . Many items , such as ' The Last Noel ' , with Stanley as Noel Coward , went on to become much-repeated classics . ' Farewell My Cinders ' is ' Cinderella ' as it might have been written by Raymond Chandler . It contained the memorable line : " People from my past flashed before my eyes . Until they got booked for indecent exposure . " . ' The Undersea World Of Jacques Cousteau ' featured Stanley as the intrepid Gallic submariner in Brighton ! Some sketches , particularly the Jewish newsreader , are overlong while ' The Bruce Fosdyke Show ' doesn't work as well as it might , but any shortcomings are compensated by the stupendous ' Girl On The Cover ' . Stanley's Edward Everett Horton is an absolute knock-out ! It tells the story of a grotesquely obese woman called Lois Latnuk , who undergoes beauty treatments to become the cover girl for ' Harpies Bizarre ' magazine . Of course it all goes horribly wrong . Great songs , sets and choreography help to make this a tasty Yuletide treat !
401187	7743887	61496	10.0	Was Columbo On A Secret Mission To Smash Capitalism ?	Let me get one thing straight - I worshipped ' Columbo ' back in the ' 70's . Of all the ' Mystery Movie ' characters , he was the one whose exploits I most appreciated . He hailed from an era when television investigators were nearly all rich , handsome , and ridiculously over-sexed , such as George Peppard in ' Banacek ' , James Farentino in ' Cool Million ' and Robert Wagner in ' It Takes A Thief ' . Columbo came as a breath of fresh air . ' Prescription : Murder ' was the first ( you can tell by how clean his coat is ! ) - and in my view - best ' Columbo ' ever . The much-maligned Gene Barry gave one of his finest performances as the first in a long line of devious killers . I'm not going to say any more about this except for one thing - watch it . But something has always bothered me about ' Columbo ' . Why does he only go after the same sort of killers ? They're nearly always rich and famous . And admired by his wife . What does Columbo say to her when the case is closed ? " Hey , honey , you know that talk-show host / blues singer / T . V . chef you like so much , I arrested him today for homicide . He's a dead cert for Death Row . " . You never saw Columbo hounding the poor in the same way . And his dishevelled appearance - the shabby coat ( obviously worn in tribute to British Prime Minister Harold Wilson ) , those tired cigars , that clapped-out auto - he's been on the force now for forty years , so must have earned enough money to enjoy a higher standard of living by now . Watching my D . V . D . ' s recently , an idea occurred to me . What if Columbo himself really was behind the murders - the openings could be red herrings - on a one-man mission to smash capitalism by putting as many rich people behind bars as possible . Maybe the reason why we never saw Mrs . Columbo was that he too had bumped her off . No wonder Bing Crosby turned down the role ! It would explain why the show was massively popular in East European countries . Richard Levinson and William Link went on to create ' Murder She Wrote ' starring Angela Lansbury , daughter of British Labour Party leader George Lansbury ! As you may have gathered , I'm having you on . But its an interesting theory , isn't it ?
401345	7743887	71041	10.0	I . T . V . ' s Best-Ever Sitcom	' Rising Damp ' was recently repeated on I . T . V . - 1 in an afternoon slot , and some chump wrote an angry letter to ' Teletext ' , claiming that the show ' was axed due to its racist content ' . Nobody bothered to correct him . ' Rising Damp ' ran for four successful seasons in the ' 70's , only coming to an end because it had reached the end of its natural life . Yes , ' Rigsby ' is ignorant when it comes to foreign cultures , but a racist ? I think not . If he were , he'd never have tolerated Philip in his house , son of a chieftain or not . Besides , the complainant seems to have overlooked Frances De La Tour's wonderfully prissy ' Ruth ' , Don Warrington as the clever and charming Phillip , the late Richard Beckinsale as naive medical student ' Alan ' and , of course , the magnificent , much-missed Leonard Rossiter as the seedy landlord ' Rigsby ' . This superb cast , combined with the fabulous scripts by Eric Chappell , made ' Rising Damp ' a classic , one that has not diminished with age . I pity those unable to appreciate its greatness .
401270	7743887	77402	10.0	The ' Citizen Kane ' Of Zombie Movies !	If proof were ever needed that the 1970's was the golden age of horror movies , ' Dawn Of The Dead ' is it . A decade after his groundbreaking ' Night Of The Living Dead ' , George A . Romero returned to zombies with this , arguably the greatest film of its kind . Low budget horror films were all the rage in those days . Strangely , the lack of money worked in their favour as film makers such as Cronenberg , DePalma , Carpenter , Lieberman and Hooper had to rely on their imaginations . Instead of big-name Hollywood stars , ' Dawn ' presents us with four ordinary people - one woman and three men - struggling to survive in a nightmarish world . The documentary look lends weight to the horror , as at times you feel that what you are watching is real ! Romero comes up with some stunning set pieces such as S . W . A . T . troopers invading a house full of the living dead , a zombie's head being sliced off by the rotor blades of a helicopter , and Hells Angels storming the shopping mall where our heroes are holed up . Tom Savini provided the gruesome make-up ( even Peckinpah never used so much blood ! ) and appears as one of the Hells Angels . Great soundtrack by Dario Argento and The Goblins ! One or two critics praised the movie at the time as an ' anti consumer society satire ' . To tell the truth , I did not notice this as I was too busy cowering in terror ! ' Dawn Of The Dead ' was a worldwide box-office hit whose success provoked dozens of imitations , mostly from Italy , such as Lucio Fulci's ' Zombi 2 ' ( ' Zombie Flesh Eaters ' ) . I liked the remake , but it relied too heavily on C . G . I . for my taste . The original leaves it standing .
400857	7743887	811356	10.0	The ( First ) Trial Of A Time Lord	So enamoured was I of Patrick Troughton's interpretation of the Doctor that I very nearly didn't watch the final part of ' The War Games ' . If he died , I did not want to see it . Reason prevailed , though , and I did watch . It opens with the Doctor , Jamie and Zoe fleeing in the TARDIS from the scene of ' The War Games ' adventure , materialising in various locations ( nice re-use of old footage from ' The Web Of Fear ' and ' Fury From The Deep ' ) , but the Time Lords prove too powerful ; the TARDIS is forced to land , and the Doctor put on trial . That booming voice - " Doctor , your travels are over ! " - sent a chill up my spine . Here the Doctor is forced to justify his ' cosmic nomad ' lifestyle . The ' War Lord ' is on trial too ; and the Time Lords bestow on him their harshest sentence imaginable - total non-existence . Jamie and Zoe's touching farewell , the monster flashbacks , the Doctor's attempts to remain rebellious even after the sentence has been passed - all add up to a magnificent conclusion to ' 60's ' Who ' .
400908	7743887	563032	10.0	" I want my red medicine ! "	Paul is temporarily working at Dr . Neilson's practice . Upton agrees to cover for him one night so he can go on a date . All goes well until the police ask him to check to see whether a man they have arrested is inebriated . He calls himself Mike Upton . . . A great Graham Chapman / Bernard McKenna episode . James Hayter was known for his voice-overs for the ' Mr . Kipling ' cake commercials . ' Liz Hickel ' , the nymphomaniac receptionist , was a change of role for Patsy Rowlands , best known for ' Bless This House ' and the ' Carry On ' films . May Warden's ' Mrs . Thompson ' isn't far removed from ' Grandma ' , which she later played in the television version of ' Billy Liar ' . But the best performance comes from Tim Brooke-Taylor lookalike Gareth Forwood , as the dim-witted ' P . C . Mansell ' . Funniest moment - Mansell repeating ' You've really landed me in it this time ' ad nauseam , causing the Sergeant to wonder whether or not he may be as drunk as Collier .
401501	7743887	57435	10.0	Hancock's Masterpiece	Following the success of ' The Rebel ' in 1960 , Tony Hancock and his writers , Ray Galton and Alan Simpson , planned a follow-up . Various ideas were kicked about ( such as having Hancock go on a round-the-world cruise , or him playing a double role ) , scripts were written , but none pleased the star . Eventually , he fired Ray and Alan , and wrote the script in collaboration with poet and novelist Philip Oakes . ' The Punch & Judy Man ' was no average British comedy film , indeed its an astonishingly bitter piece , casting Hancock as ' Wally Pinner ' , a depressed , middle-aged Punch and Judy man in the English seaside town of Piltdown . His marriage to the lovely but aloof Delia is on the point of collapse , and he is looked down upon by the pompous dignitaries who run the town , such as the Mayor ( Hancock hated snobbery in real life ) . Pinner's only friend is the Sandman , a local eccentric who makes historical sculptures out of sand . Pinner is persuaded by Delia to give a show at a forthcoming dinner to commemorate 100 years of Piltdown , at which a member of the aristocracy will be present . Needless to say , it gets out of hand , degenerating into a bun-throwing fight . The film's main strength is that it does not try hard to be funny , the humour flows naturally , and even when not particularly amusing it manages to engage , such as Wally's conversation over tea with the Sandman . Only the bun fight at the end looks as though it were written in at the last minute , but its a minor criticism . Hancock gives a superb performance as the cynical ' Pinner ' , and is supported by such talented actors as Sylvia Syms , Ronald Fraser , Barbara Murray , Hugh Lloyd and . of course , John Le Mesurier . Hattie Jacques is fleetingly seen as a fortune teller . Public apathy ensured that Hancock and Oakes did not collaborate on another project . A great shame , as it is a cut above the Norman Wisdom and ' Carry On ' series of the day . Be warned , however , the D . V . D . is missing a scene where Pinner works off his rage by inserting a bunch of flowers into a ceramic pig's rectum . Presumably it was deleted to enable the D . V . D . to get a ' U ' certificate . Funniest moment - Pinner's ice cream eating contest with the little boy played by Nicholas Webb . As good as anything Chaplin ever did .
