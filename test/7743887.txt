400918	7743887	198197	1.0	" Its Make Your Mind Up Time ! "	There has been renewed interest in Hughie Green recently thanks to a B . B . C . - 4 play called ' Most Sincerely ' starring Trevor Eve . The ex-'Shoestring ' actor gave a decent performance , if not quite capturing the sheer awfulness of the real Green . To say that I did not like him would be an understatement - the man raised verbal diarrhoea to an art form , and had an annoying habit of rolling his eyes , rather like ' Private Frazer ' from ' Dad's Army ' during one of his ' we're doomed ! ' monologues . Each week Hughie came on to the sound of Bob Sharples ' big band and in that sickly way of his introduced singers , comedians , magicians , novelty acts such as Tony Holland ( the musical muscle man ) , that bald guy who whacked himself on the head with a tray while singing ' Mule Train ' ( which caused untold headaches among British children when they tried to copy him ) and blokes who made plates spin on wooden sticks to the ' Pick Of The Pops ' theme . Then there was the legendary Brooks Aehron , who skilfully recreated Jerry Lewis ' ' Typewriter Song ' . It is easy to mock these individuals now , but there was a certain fascination to be had from them , like watching a dog chasing its own tail . Let us not forget that ' OpKnocks ' was responsible for creating a great many stars , among them Freddie Starr , Les Dawson , Lena Zavaroni , Little & Large , Mary Hopkin , Freddie ' Parrot Face ' Davies ( remember him ? ) , Peters & Lee , and Pam Ayres . You may or may not like these people , but the fact is they managed to have more enduring careers than those of the twerps thrown up by ' The X Factor ' and ' Pop Idol ' . Each act would be prefaced by a ' sponsor ' - a member of the public or sometimes a celebrity ( ' Emmerdale Farm ' actor Fraser Hines being one ) . From time to time these sponsors gave Hughie gifts . Bob Monkhouse was ordered to resign from ' The Golden Shot ' after being suspected of taking bribes , yet Hughie was doing it openly on air . Sometimes the acts had a familiar look about them . One was Adam Daye , an impressionist whose repertoire ran to Kenneth Williams and . . . er , that was it . Daye went on ' OpKnocks ' months after being seen in L . W . T . ' s quick fire comedy show ' Who Do You Do ? ' . Comedian Pat Tansey got nowhere on ' OpKnocks ' and went on its rival , A . T . V . ' s ' New Faces ' - which he won . But when a tabloid newspaper pointed out he had been on Hughie's show , the ' New Faces ' production team had no choice but to disqualify him . One element of ' OpKnocks ' I disliked were the child performers . As soon as you saw some freckle-faced kid dancing and singing Shirley Temple-style you knew he / she was going to win . Grannies and granddads would go " Ah , isn't he / she cute ? " , before writing to Hughie in their millions . One such performer was Stephen Smith , who banged drums while his Dad - Jimmy - played the organ . They originally appeared under the name ' Jimmy Smith & Son ' , but a week later - after the first of many wins - relaunched themselves as ' Stephen Smith & Father ' . Little Stephen's facial expressions whilst drumming suggested latent psychopathic tendencies . His favourite subject was his teeth . I used to wonder how a child could lose so many choppers in one week . It had to be that bigger boys were jealous of his success and were knocking them out with their fists . I knew how they felt . Another group of precocious youngsters were collectively known as ' The Weltons ' , whose speciality was performing the same song every week . I felt sorry for the adult acts unlucky enough to appear on the same shows - they needed their big breaks there and then , but did not get them because of sentimental old folks voting for these brats . At the close of each edition , the acts would be paraded for the viewers one final time as the legendary ' clap-o-meter ' - a device designed to measure audience applause , not sexually transmitted diseases - came into play . " Remember , folks ! " , said Hughie , " The clap-o-meter is just for fun ! " . But time marches on and eventually the powers-that-be ( Jeremy Isaacs and Philip Jones ) decided that Hughie should go . Not only was the show hopelessly outdated even in 1978 , but what did for him was his using it as a platform for his far-right political views . In fairness he only did it twice , but that was enough . Hughie politely asked the British public not to go on strike in future , before a choir struck up with ' Stand Up & Be Counted ' . All around the nation you could the collective sound of raspberries blown . Hughie's patriotism led him to do other bizarre things , such as televising ' OpKnocks ' from the British submarine base at Holy Loch , Scotland one week as a warning to the U . S . S . R . in case they were thinking of attacking Britain . Though Hughie reassured fans that he had no plans to retire , he was barely on the box after ' OpKnocks ' ended . A decade later , it was revived - by the B . B . C . - but without Hughie . They brought in Bob Monkhouse and later former winner Les Dawson to front the show . Hughie was given the courtesy credit of ' Consultant ' . Unsurprisingly , the new-look version was better than the old , even if it did give us Rosser & Davies . And I mean that most sincerely , folks .
400675	7743887	931335	1.0	People In Glass Houses Shouldn't Throw Stones	I never thought I'd find myself feeling sorry for Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan , Tom Cruise , Kevin Federline , Heather Mills , Geri Halliwell , George Michael , Jamie Oliver et al . This programme listed 100 celebrities ( movie and pop stars , presenters , comedians , footballers , and politicians ) who have in some way or other teed off the nation in the last year . Except for me , because I do not read tacky tabloids , gossip magazines nor watch soap operas , sport or reality shows . What I found really annoying , however , were the presenters / showbiz journalists / comedians / gossip columnists presiding over this trial by television , amongst them Carole Malone , Kevin O'Sullivan , Gina Yashere , Ian Hyland and Polly Graham , all of whom were clucking like mother hens . You have never seen a more aggressive , rude and pompous bunch in your life . So what if Britney chooses not to wear panties when she goes nightclubbing ? Its a free world , isn't it ? ( Being a man , I must defend this habit ! ) Does it really matter whether or not Jade Goody has made a career out of being a simpleton ? Aren't there more urgent problems facing the world right now ? As someone who used to be a journalist ( albeit only for a local paper with a circulation confined to doctor's surgeries ) , I can safely say that your average news hound - male or female - drunk out of his / her mind is a more repellent sight than a rock star misbehaving at an awards show . One of my colleagues used to take delight in dropping her underwear whenever intoxicated . Another had a serious gambling addiction . They should be the last people on Earth to condemn others . Interestingly , the narrator was ex-'Blue Peter ' presenter Richard Bacon , himself no stranger to controversy . Besides , without Britney et al , how would they sell their rags ? Showbiz scandals are the lifeblood of tabloid journalism . They would be the first to complain if George Michael ' kept it in his pants ' and thus deprived them of good copy . The programme was little more than an excuse for a lot of untalented nobodies to vent their frustration on air at not being invited to more parties .
401388	7743887	317200	1.0	The British Tragedy Awards , More Like	I look forward to ' The British Comedy Awards ' each year because it provides me with an excellent excuse to go out for the evening . This annual jamboree has got it all ; talentless , big headed ' comedians ' winning awards despite their shows being absolute rubbish ; incoherent , rambling ' thank you ' speeches ; endless close-ups of grinning nobodies in tuxedos , obnoxious behaviour from Jonathan Ross ( his belittling of Rod Hull was inexcusable ) was and , of course , loads of swearing . Wa-hay , lads ! Why do these people still think swear words have any shock value left ? I wasn't offended by Julian Clary's ' fisting ' comment because it was mild compared to what you normally hear at this non-event . Worse , the occasion lends a veneer of respectability to the most appalling shows . Dare to venture a mildly derogatory comment about , say , ' Little Britain ' and you'll get the reply : " How come it won a ' Comedy Award ' then ? " . I would love to know the criteria used to pick the winners . It would seem that the awards are handed out on the basis of how much publicity the winner's private life has attracted . Which explains why Michael Barrymore was so successful for so long . And as for ' Mr . Blobby ' winning an award , well it speaks for itself , doesn't it ?
401496	7743887	327162	1.0	Easily The Worst And Most Unnecessary Remake Ever !	Its disturbing to note the number of classic ' 70's films that have had their reputations trashed by ' remakes ' - ' The Wicker Man ' , ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' The Omen ' , ' Assault On Precinct 13 ' and now this . Ira Levin's novel was not a laugh-out-loud comedy , and neither was Bryan Forbes ' 1975 movie , but this Frank Oz-directed film tries to be - and fails dismally . The screenplay adheres closely to the original story , but over-eggs the pudding with ' funny ' one-liners , and a ludicrous ' happy ' ending which makes the finale of the 1980 ' Revenge Of The Stepford Wives ' T . V . movie seem believable by comparison . The story was intended as a darkly humorous comment on the women's lib movement , as the male population of a small American town tries to reverse the tide of feminism by murdering their wives and replacing them with robot doubles , replicas both obedient and beautiful . But the tone of the original has been allowed to leak away ; this lumbering travesty has the look and feel of a 1960's sitcom . About the only thing missing is a laugh track . As for the performances , Nicole Kidman is so wooden that when she first appeared I thought she had already been ' replaced ' . Bette Midler , is as always , terrible . Glenn Close , Christopher Walken and Matthew Broderick could have phoned in their performances . The exact nature of the duplications is confused - are the women being replaced by robots , or simply brainwashed ? For most of the picture , it appears to be the former , but when Broderick shuts down the control centre at the climax , the wives regain their personalities , suggesting the latter . What a cop-out . I have heard complaints that the 1975 movie was ' cheesy ' . Well , let me put the record straight . Fashions , hairstyles , technology etc . may have changed dramatically since the 70's , but the fact remains that Bryan Forbes ' movie is a far better picture than this one . William Goldman's script did not insult the intelligence of the audience , and Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss outclass Kidman and Midler . On the cheeseometer , the remake registers as pure Stilton . I wonder which sci-fi classic will be next in line for the same treatment . John Frankenheimer's ' Seconds ' ? Will the remake end with ' Tony Wilson ' ( the Rock Hudson character in the original ) cracking lame gags as a Company doctor drills his skull ?
401196	7743887	824182	1.0	Why Mel & Griff Are The Real Two Ninnies	In the final ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' , Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones famously put the boot into ' The Two Ronnies ' with ' The Two Ninnies ' . It wasn't an affectionate parody , more a savage attack . They cruelly berated Barker and Corbett for doing the same sort of jokes twenty years later ( inaccurate as ' The Two Ronnies ' had only been on for ten years at that point ) . How hypocritical for Smith and Jones then to front this show , which features them doing exactly the same thing ! ' Alas Smith & Jones ' was one of the best sketch shows of the ' 80's , but this ' tribute ' series did it no favours . ' The Two Ronnies ' compilations featured uncut material , here we got only excerpts interspersed with weak links . Are today's viewers so dim they need to have a joke explained before they see it ? Even Mel and Griff looked embarrassed , as well they might . Fortunately , the ' head-to-head ' sketches stand up well even now . After ' Morons From Outer Space ' and now this , a little humility from Mel and Griff would not go amiss .
401003	7743887	1068700	1.0	Old McDonald Had A Show . . .	" Alistair Campbell wrote in his diaries that he once contemplated suicide . After reading fifteen pages , I know just how he feels . " . That was the best ' gag ' in a recent edition of ' News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald ' . After fifteen seconds of the first show , I too felt like doing away with myself . Proof if any were needed that satire is dead in the 21st century , ' News Knight ' tries hard to be another ' Have I Got News For You ' - a host presides over a panel of three guests , and invites them to make sharp , witty comments on the week's news . Unfortunately , none of them do . The rivalry that made ' H . I . G . N . F . Y . ' so much fun is conspicuously missing . Among the panel is Marcus Brigstocke , described ( but not by me ) as one of ' Britain's youngest , brightest comedians ' . He's appeared on so many similar shows one imagines he has ' Satire Show Guest ' written on his passport . He might be hilarious after a few drinks down at the pub , but on television he comes across as a smug so-and-so without a funny bone in his body . Invited to make fun of the Alistair Campbell book , he couldn't do so and instead resorted to cheap insult . Frankie Boyle was better , but the worst thing about this programme is Sir Trevor himself , who these days bears an uncomfortable resemblance to his ' Spitting Image ' puppet . Sir Trev's delivery is so bad one wonders if he thinks he's auditioning for the job of a speak your weight machine . Hot on the heels of Ben Elton's dud ' Get A Grip ' , ' News Knight ' is marginally less amusing than its namesake - ' Newsnight ' - on B . B . C . - 2 . At least Jeremy Paxman knows how to be both funny and intelligent .
401383	7743887	90323	1.0	Wild Cheese 2	' The Wild Geese ' ( 1978 ) , by no means a classic , was Oscar winning stuff compared to this stinker . Edward Fox plays the brother of the Richard Burton character ; the dialogue at the start tries to imply that Eddie was out there alongside Richard in the African veldt . Oh no he wasn't ! Based on Daniel Carney's ' The Square Circle ' , this is rubbish as adventure , lacking in action , being a compendium of the worst spy movie clichés of all time . At one point , someone even says : " We ask the questions ! " . Roger Moore had the good sense to turn it down , instead we get Scott Glenn looking as though he's stepped off the set of ' Westworld ' , and Barbara Carrera as the token crumpet . The plot concerns a publicity seeking U . S . news network hiring mercenaries to free Rudolf Hess from Spandau prison . Whilst it was possible to root for the original Wild Geese as they rescued a democratically-elected Prime Minister , its impossible to care if Glenn , Fox and Carrera spring Hess . Luckily for us , Euan Lloyd retired not long afterwards .
401137	7743887	257295	1.0	A Human Pigsty	Television producers are notorious for their lack of irony . Peter Weir's ' The Truman Show ' warned of the dangers of taking reality television too far . Those geniuses at Endemol U . K . couldn't have paid heed because each summer ' Big Brother ' stinks up Channel 4's schedules like an overflowing dustbin in a heatwave . Its odd now to look back at that first series and see how normal the contestants were compared with those of recent years . Now the show's rules are being deliberately ignored so that ' voted-out ' contestants can be brought back , resulting in understandable viewer fury . Why have rules if they can't be bothered to obey them ? ' B . B . ' deserves to be pilloried for giving undeserved media exposure to obnoxious , arrogant , foul-mouthed types who clearly belong in a mental home . With any luck it will one day be consigned to the same fate as ' The Black & White Minstrel Show ' - unloved and forgotten , a relic of a shameful era when the lowest common denominator reigned supreme on British television .
401494	7743887	94517	1.0	A Mystery How It Lasted So Long	Though it began in 1988 , ' M . S . T . 3 . K . ' didn't arrive in the U . K . until the late ' 90's , when Season 9 was shown by The Sci-Fi Channel . I was given to understand it had a cult following among American teenagers , presumably the sort who chew gum a lot and wear ear-plugs to bed to stop their brains spilling out on to the pillows . The first edition I saw featured Jack Arnold's ' Revenge Of The Creature ' , a mediocre film to be sure , but no turkey . I enjoyed the film as much as I could , but the segments involving Mike Nelson , Mary Jo Pehl , the robots and apes were so painfully unfunny I wanted to brain the writers and cast with that cheap-looking Airfix model that's supposed to represent a spaceship . And Bridget Jones should stick to sliding down fireman's poles . We were not allowed to view the films properly as they were continually talked over and interrupted by the dumb stuff . Some , such as ' Riding With Death ' and ' Cosmic Princess ' , were not movies at all ( a fact the cast conveniently neglected to mention ) , but compilations of old T . V . shows ( ' The Gemini Man ' and ' Space : 1999 ' to be exact ) and therefore should not have been included . One of the earlier editions had ' Revenge Of The Mysterons ' , made up of four episodes from ' Captain Scarlet & The Mysterons ' , a 1967 children's sci-fi show which is rightly regarded in the U . K . as a classic ( its recently been remade ) . To see the country that gave the world ' Galactica 1980 ' and the second season of ' Buck Rogers ' ( the one with ' Hawk ' ) sneering at this wonderfully imaginative show made me want to puke . An outrageous insult to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson . Its possible that ' M . S . T . ' was a good show in the early days , but there was no sign of quality in the episodes I viewed . Nelson had all the charm of a lavatory brush , while the tacky sets and tin-bath robots appeared to be left-overs from a bad kiddies show circa 1970 . Some of the movies , such as ' Agent For H . A . R . M . ' . and ' The Horror Of Party Beach ' deserved ridicule , but this was not the place to do it . The net effect was akin to a bald man laughing at one with a receding hairline . I have noticed that a number of I . M . D . B . reviewers have based their strong views of the films not on the originals , but on the ' M . S . T . 3 . K . ' versions . This isn't right . In Britain , ' M . S . T . 3 . K ' proved a ratings loser ( another triumph for British good taste ! ) . Seasons 10 and 11 were never shown here . I do not think we missed anything special . Thankfully , it is no longer with us . I hope that one day the show itself comes under fire from the comedians of the future , who regard the spectacle of a bad television show mocking bad movies as an act of hypocrisy .
401290	7743887	127369	1.0	" We'll Be Right Back After The Break ! "	' 3-2-1 ' is one of television's greatest enigmas . Though it ended two decades ago , even now I wonder from time-to-time : " Why ? " . Made by Yorkshire Television , it consisted basically of various formats bolted together ; game show , variety show , children's show ( Dusty Bin ) , all linked by a finger-twisting Ted Rogers . Poor Ted . Having made a name for himself on programmes such as ' Jokers Wild ' as a quick-witted comic , he then had the misfortune to find himself in this slop ( he later admitted that the early editions made him cringe ) . Ditto Fiona Curzon , who prior to becoming a ' 3-2-1 ' beauty had appeared in Granada's popular I . T . V . thriller show ' The X-Y-Y Man ' . And what of poor Caroline Munro , a one-time Hammer Horror starlet who had been in Bond and Sinbad movies , reduced to playing second fiddle to a dustbin ? Originating from Spain ( Margaret Forwood of The Sun said ' it was the most undesirable thing to come out of that country since bullfighting ' ) , it ran for nearly a decade . So someone must have liked it . What was its appeal ? Well , it had razzmatazzz by the bucketload ( Johnny Pearson's theme was the most bombastic ever written for the box ) , glamour ( a gang of Continental beauties called ' The Gentle Secs ' , one of whom - Mireille Allonville - had appeared in soft porn films ) , intrigue ( those cryptic clues would have baffled Sherlock Holmes ) , and the ever present threat of ' Dusty Bin ' . Initially , the bin was inert , but then they made him move . The sight of a grinning bin gliding across the floor of the studio sent a collective shiver up the spines of the nation . ' Dr . Who ' could not have done it better . One or two poor souls won it from time to time , and to compound their humiliation Ted then asked them to smile and wave at the camera . The worst thing about the show were the sketches , many of which seemed to have been originally written for ' Crackerjack ' . Some nights the cast looked genuinely embarrassed at having to perform them . The first episode had as a contestant a pre-Radio 1 Janice Long , who curiously neglected to mention that she was Keith Chegwin's sister ( this was years before ' Naked Jungle ' ) . The early shows featured Mike Newman , Chris Emmett , and Debbie Arnold making lame quips inbetween the questions . Emmett wheeled out his impression of then-Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan practically every week , but when Margaret Thatcher moved into 10 , Downing Street , political humour suddenly became noticeably absent . The show carried the credit : ' Production Associate Michael Sullivan ' . The late Mr . Sullivan was a top showbiz agent , meaning that a lot of the ' 3-2-1 ' guest-stars came straight off his books . A young Mark Heap appeared in one edition ( I'm sure he's proud to have it on his C . V . ) . Easy to be cynical now , but ' 3-2-1 ' was huge in its day . They could not get away with it today though . Could they ?
401370	7743887	590993	2.0	Around The World In Thirty Minutes	The Goodies want to raise money for charity , and approach Mr . Sparklipegs , head of the ' Sparklipegs ' toothpaste company - whose employees boast pearly-white teeth - and offer to walk from London to Brighton if he sponsors them £10 per mile . Sensing a good publicity opportunity , he accepts , provided that they do the walk wearing toothpaste tube costumes , and on space-hoppers . To his amazement , they agree . Instead of stopping at Brighton , they bounce around the world . Sparklipegs worries he will soon be made bankrupt . . . Easily the second worst ' Goodies ' episode , the first being ' Women's Lib ' . There's hardly any interaction between Tim , Graeme and Bill , most of the laughs come from Freddie Jones as the Scrooge-like toothpaste tycoon , and Jonathan Cecil as his ' Yes Man ' - ' Arthur Minion ' . Gilly McIver steals the show as the constantly grinning Miss Simpkin . Episode adopts a nicely cynical attitude to the apparently benevolent motives of the organisers of sponsored charity events , but the sight of three grown men bouncing around the world in toothpaste tubes soon grows tiresome . Funniest moment - in South Africa , we see a man playing a piano where the white and black keys have been segregated . Crude political satire , but stunningly effective .
401378	7743887	81431	3.0	" Rising Damp , Its Climbing Up The Wall ! "	The film version of ' Rising Damp ' came out two years after the television series ended . Like many fans I duly went along to the cinema when it opened . I came away bitterly disappointed . Eric Chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script ; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes . At the time of the film's release , the ' Rising Damp ' series was still being repeated regularly on I . T . V . so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already . At least the ' On The Buses ' movies boasted original screenplays . Secondly , Richard Beckinsale had died the year before , so they eliminated the character of ' Alan ' as a mark of respect , substituting art student ' John ' , played by Christopher Strauli of ' Only When I Laugh ' fame . It simply wasn't the same . As another poster has pointed out , Rigsby's boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series , being bigger and altogether cleaner . Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original ' Casino Royale ' , a film steeped in surreal humour . ' Rising Damp ' also has its share of ' Walter Mitty ' style fantasy sequences , such as the ' Saturday Night Fever ' parody . Personally , I found them horribly out of place . A case of ' over-egging the pudding ' . On the plus side , Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy ' Rigsby ' , as are Frances De La Tour as ' Ruth ' and Don Warrington as ' Philip . Its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents . When Rossiter died in 1984 , it was shown by I . T . V . as a tribute , with its final scene - showing Rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste .
401460	7743887	69616	4.0	When Norman Was Nobody	Norman Wisdom's film career seemed to be well and truly over by 1970 ( his last cinematic outing being 1969's ' What's Good For The Goose ' ) , so he accepted an offer from A . T . V . to do a sitcom . ' Norman ' was penned by Ray Cooney and John Chapman , and cast him as ' Norman Wilkins ' , an Inland Revenue man who hates taking money . With Sally Bazely and David Lodge ( both of whom had appeared with him in ' Goose ' ) , it was a modest success . His next show was not for another three years , and a strange beast it turned out to be . No laugh track , for one thing . And little of the slapstick for which Norman was renowned and loved . Norman played ' Nobody ' , a loser with no personality of his own . But when he put on a hat , he suddenly adopted the characteristics of its owner . Were he to don a policeman's helmet , for example , he'd suddenly start bending his knees and whistling the ' Dixon Of Dock Green ' theme . If he put on a schoolboy's cap , he would begin acting like Just William . Give him a deerstalker and he'd become Sherlock Holmes . The show was basically ' Mr . Benn ' without the fancy dress shop . ' Nobody ' lived with his domineering old trout of a mother ( Natalie Kent ) , whom his girlfriend Grace ( Priscilla Morgan ) tried to get him away from . Each week ' Nobody ' found himself in a different situation , playing a variation on his character . One episode had him doing a brilliant impersonation of Peter Falk's ' Columbo ' , but another had him roughed up by gangsters , and his Stan Laurel-like cries were pathetic rather than amusing . Though a reasonable ratings success , ' Nobody ' wasn't seen again , and Norman went on to do the more successful ' A Little Bit Of Wisdom ' .
400875	7743887	66564	4.0	Jerry Gets His Marching Orders	As Ben Elton once observed , nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy . Steve Martin's latest offering - ' The Pink Panther 2 ' - recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box-office grosses , while Mike Myers ' ' The Love Guru ' seems to have won few admirers . In 1970 , it was Jerry Lewis ' turn to feel the pain of rejection ( ironically , his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence ) when ' Which Way To The Front ? ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade . In this World War Two comedy , he plays ' Brendan Byers 111 ' , the richest man in the world , who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty ( and also because he is bored with being successful ) but is rejected as he is medically unfit . He then decides to start his own privately funded army , recruiting other 4-F's . Decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by ' International Rescue ' in ' Thunderbirds ' , they go into training . Some good visual gags here . When they fire rocket launchers , they look pleased with themselves , until they learn they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station ! Wishing to learn German , Brendan plays a long-playing record called ' Songs To Mein Kampf By ' . When this army sits down to eat , instead of being in a draughty mess hall , they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier . John Wood is very funny as ' Finkel ' , Byers ' ever-so English butler . His best scene is when he blackmails a Mafia-type gangster into teaching Byers ' brigade to kill . The script was not by Jerry himself , but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso , author of a number of episodes of ' The Monkees ' . ' Front ' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom , indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh-track . Where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a top Nazi commander and , after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front , gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler ( and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight ! ) . As the commander , Jerry delivers a performance of such mind-numbing ineptitude as to defy description . He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the ' loudest man alive ' stakes . It comes as a relief when the end credits appear . Perhaps the timing was just wrong - bringing out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea . Or the public simply had had enough of Jerry ( that beard probably did not help ! ) . What he needed here was a good producer , someone to take him in hand and say : " That gag stinks . Throw it out ! " . ' Don't Raise The Bridge , Lower The River ' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture . As the ' 70's got underway , the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen , Mel Brooks , and Monty Python - fresher , more biting and in Allen's case , more human styles of comedy replaced Jerry's brand of slapstick . It would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback - as the conceited talk-show host ' Jerry Langford ' in Martin Scorcese's brilliant ' The King Of Comedy ' .
401559	7743887	563027	4.0	" But I've had mumps ! "	Examining one of Collier's patients ( an obstinate old woman demanding a second opinion ) , Upton keels over . He has the symptoms of mumps , and is admitted to St . Swithins as a patient . Unfortunately , he is on Bingham's ward , and finds himself next to Mr . Gilbert , an annoying man who fancies he knows more about medicine than the doctors . Gilbert's brother Jimbo is just as bad . Upton takes a shine to nurse Allison , and begins chatting her up . Bingham fancies her too , and sets about trying to break the pair up . . . In a sitcom with a run of twenty-nine episodes , there was bound to be at least one major clunker , and this is it . Too much time is given over to ghastly Mr . Gilbert and his brother , not enough on the regulars . Gilbert seems to have been based on the ' Wendover ' character ( played by Arthur Haynes ) from the 1966 film ' Doctor In Clover ' , but James Bree ( a fine support actor ) isn't capable of making him remotely amusing or likable . Even Richard O'Sullivan's ' Bingham ' grates here . Notable mainly for the appearance of Angela Douglas as ' Allison ' . She was the wife of Kenneth More , who played ' Richard Grimsdyke ' in the original ' Doctor In The House ' movie . Funniest moment - Bingham realising he has mumps !

Bob Grant and Stephen Lewis raid the ' On The Buses ' archive yet again for this episode , its ' Self Defence ' from Season 2 given a footballing angle . The ' Basildon Bashers ' are a collection of dolly-birds and middle-aged frumps who resort to cheating by distracting the male players as only women know how . When Stan complains , they tear off his shorts . Funniest moment - Blakey wandering into the women's changing room in his long johns !
401629	7743887	145631	5.0	Everybody Out - Again !	Following the end of ' On The Buses ' in 1973 , Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney searched for another hit . ' Don't Drink The Water ' , a spin-off from ' Buses ' , failed to duplicate the success of its parent show , while ' Yus My Dear ' , though it got to No . 1 in the ratings for most of its episodes , was fairly dire . A comedy pilot for the B . B . C . entitled ' The Boys & Mrs . B ' was equally awful , despite starring the wonderful Thora Hird and a young Tony Robinson . Wolfe and Chesney then decided that enough time had elapsed since the end of their first major success - ' The Rag Trade ' - to engineer a revival . The B . B . C . passed on the idea ( do they never learn ? ) , so they took it to London Weekend Television . Peter Jones and Miriam Karlin reprised their roles as ' Harold Fenner ' and ' Paddy ' , but the rest of the cast was new . Christopher Beeny , fresh in the public's memory from ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' replaced Reg Varney ( his character undergoing a name change to ' Tony ' ) , the buxom and giggly Diane Langton slotted effortlessly into the space vacated by Barbara Windsor , Anna Karen played ' Olive ' ( when ' On The Buses ' ended Olive was single again , but here she was happily married . We never found out just who the new man in her life was ) . Deddie Davies ' fluttery ' Mabel ' was obviously intended as another ' Lily ' ( the Esma Cannon character from the original ) . Future ' Eastenders ' star Gillian Taylforth made her television debut as ' Lyn ' . In a nod to multiculturalism , one of the new intake at ' Fenner's Fashions ' was black - ' Jo-Jo ' - played by Lucita Lijertwood . One major new character - the haughty ' Mrs . Fenner ' - was played first by Rowena Cooper and then ' Doctor In Charge's ' Joy Stewart . The first episode was a remake of ' The Sample ' from 1961 . This being 1977 , the humour was predictably coarsened , the language slightly stronger ( with words like ' scrubber ' and ' knickers ' bandied about ) . Despite its resolutely anti-trade union stance , the show occasionally took pot shots at the alternative . MABEL : You can always trust a politician who smokes a pipe . LYN : What about Margaret Thatcher ? She doesn't smoke a pipe . PADDY : She would do if she thought it would get her a few more votes , love . Lindsay De Paul provided the catchy theme tune . Despite being a ratings success , ' The Rag Trade ' somehow never replicated the affection of its predecessor . One angry letter to ' The Sun ' suggested it should be renamed ' The Drag Trade ' and that everyone in it ' should be out ' . It was unfortunate that Wolfe and Chesney chose to resurrect the show at a time when trade unions were massively unpopular . After only two seasons , Fenner's Fashions shut up shop again , this time for good . Parodied by L . W . T . ' s ' End Of Part One ' as ' The Gag Trade ' with Fenner's girls as scriptwriters instead of dressmakers .
400803	7743887	818956	6.0	" Why am I doing this at my age ? "	Billy has really done it this time . Not only has he made multiple dates with girls on the same night , but an urn containing the ashes of a valued client has mysteriously disappeared from Shadrach & Duxbury's funeral parlour . The undertaker subjects Billy to relentless questioning . Back home , the Fishers are struggling to redecorate their living room without the paint Billy promised to bring home from work . . . The last ' Billy Liar ' episode of all , and a disappointing finale to the series . Billy is kept away from his family for almost the whole episode , and when he finally goes home we are not privileged to see or hear the argument raging in the living room . Our last sight is of him emerging covered in yellow paint . It beggars belief that Billy would so daft as to set up dates with practically every eligible female in Stradhoughton on the same night , besides this plot device had been used in the previous series . The main joke here is Mr . Fisher roping in various visitors to assist in the redecoration of the lounge . The impression given is of Waterhouse and Hall running out of ideas . Which may explain why this was the last episode . Even the scenes where Billy sees his employer and family as Nazis had been done before . Eighteen months later , another comedy character with a strong fantasy life found his way onto British television . Although not as young as Billy , Reginald Iolanthe Perrin was every bit as imaginative . Funniest moment - Mr . Fisher searches for Grandma , and finds he has absentmindedly covered her in a sheet !
401484	7743887	65967	6.0	Harry In Search Of Kip	Sometimes the past is best left undisturbed . This picture was a favourite of mine and used to play often on 70's television , usually in a late-night slot . I had thought of it as a tense , gritty movie full of exciting action and superb performances . Then it mysteriously disappeared from our screens , so when the opportunity arose recently to view it once again , I jumped at the chance . Oh dear . Based on the novel ' The Ordeal Of Major Grigsby ' by John Sherlock , ' The Last Grenade ' begins in the Congo . A mercenary unit , headed by Major Harry Grigsby ( Stanley Baker ) , is waiting to be picked up by a helicopter by one of their number , Kip Thompson ( Alex Cord ) . Instead he has changed sides and wipes them out en masse - laughing like a maniac as he does so - before blowing up their camp for good measure . Only Grigsby survives , swearing revenge . Some time later , he is back in England and recovering from tuberculosis in a sanitarium when the British Government ( naturally bothered by an American mercenary's activities in a foreign land ) asks him to kill Thompson who has been making a nuisance of himself in China by making cross border raids . You would think they would prefer to use someone in better health , but that's politicians for you . Taking along other mercenaries - including Julian Glover and John Thaw ( criminally wasted in such a small role ) , he sets about hunting for his hated adversary . They eventually meet , but instead of killing Grigsby where he stands , Thompson puts him in solitary confinement , from which he is able to escape easily . This lapse in logic is not isolated ; as the film progresses , other opportunities crop up for Thompson to remove Grigsby , but for reasons unexplained , he chooses not to do so . We know of course why - the story would have ended there and then . Harry then begins an affair with Katherine ( Honor Blackman ) , the good-looking wife of General Whiteley ( Richard Attenborough - also wasted in this movie ) , and considers calling off the search for Thompson ( forgetting of course that he has been paid to do the job by British tax-payers ) and settle down to a life of domestic bliss . Thompson has other ideas and kills Katherine ( he was really after her husband , but never mind ) . So now Harry is full of fury once more , and storms off into the rainy forests to look for Kip . You think a big fight is coming , but no , it does not and suddenly the credits are rolling up the screen . Watching this the other night I wondered how on earth the writers - one of whom was James Mitchell , creator of ' Callan ' - thought that they could get away with such blatantly obvious plot holes , some of which are big enough for Thompson to fly his helicopter through . Even my wife ( a confirmed soap opera addict ) spotted them , which tells you all you need to know . Baker makes a convincing mercenary - all moustache and muscles , upper lip trembling in anticipation of the final kill - more so than the cast of ' The Wild Geese ' combined . Harry using a corpse as a trap for Thompson is in character , but his decision to stop hunting for Thompson to move in with Katherine is not . As the giggling psycho , Alex Cord's performance surely must have been a big influence on Christopher Walken when he played ' Max Zorin ' in the Bond movie ' A View To A Kill ' fifteen years later . Ray Brooks is around too , but got better dialogue when he did ' Mr . Benn ' . On the plus side , there is impressive location filming in Spain ( doubling for the Congo ) and China . The opening massacre gets the film off to a thundering start . But from then on , it is all downhill , as the plot wanders around in circles . We do not even get to see Grigsby and Thompson engage in hand-to-hand combat . Gordon Flemyng , the director , was also responsible for the two ' Dr . Who ' movies of the ' 60's starring Peter Cushing , and you will find more excitement in those than this . If you enjoyed ' The Last Grenade ' in 1970 , then to preserve your happy memories do not watch it now . Believe me , ' The Wild Geese ' is ' Apocalypse Now ' by comparison .
401652	7743887	69609	6.0	Back To Basics ?	Produced by H . T . V . West , ' Men Of Affairs ' was a spin-off from the 1973 movie ' Don't Just Lie There , Say Something ' , adapted in turn from a hit stage farce . Rix reprised his role , but as Leslie Phillips was making ' Casanova 73 ' for the B . B . C . , Warren Mitchell ( in monocle and toupee ) replaced him . Each week , the perpetually randy Sir William got up to naughty business , persuaded the hapless Ovis to cover for him , usually very badly . Misunderstandings piled on top of misunderstandings , and of course this being the ' 70's there'd be lots of dolly birds in various states of undress capering around bedrooms , and hiding in wardrobes . Joan Sims provided welcome support as Sir William's harridan of a wife . For lovers of British stage farce , this was essential viewing . I don't know if it still exists in the archives , but if so its a pity it wasn't repeated during John Major's time as Prime Minister . The labyrinthine plots of sex and deception would have seemed startlingly prescient .
401457	7743887	129710	6.0	Nice Format , Shame About Some Of The Guests	When Stephen Fry went on ' Room 101 ' , he lambasted the format and proposed a variant whereby guests named their favourite things . Its easy to see why it wasn't made . Negativity gets big audiences , positivity doesn't . ' Room 101 ' is unmissable only when the guest is brilliantly funny ( the episodes with Spike Milligan , Peter Cook and Linda Smith spring to mind ) . Put someone who used to be on ' Blue Peter ' or ' Eastenders ' on it and you're in big trouble . Nick Hancock was the first and best presenter ; Paul Merton is okay but tends not to put up much of an argument against the guest's choices . To give an example , when Michael Grade selected ' Dr . Who ' , Merton caved in completely , letting Grade spit his venom . Also the use of out-of context film clips is annoying in the extreme . On one occasion , the American singer Johnnie Ray was shown miming badly to one of his hits . I wonder if the studio audience's hilarity would have been as great if they'd been told beforehand he was stone deaf ?
401146	7743887	675786	6.0	5C Brushes With Dearth !	5C is entrusted with helping local pensioners and looking after kids - tasks which , surprisingly , they excel at . The only person unhappy with the idea is Potter , who has been told by 5C that ' geriatrics ' is the name of a person ( Jerry Atrix ) coming to Fenn Street School to take his job . In disgust , he tears off his badges in the staff room , and flings his hat out of the window . One pensioner who proves difficult is Albert Dearth , who won't wash nor let anyone in his house to tidy up . Craven decides to give him help - whether he wants it or not . . . I suspect that this episode , along with ' Norman's Conquest ' was written to placate those critics who regarded ' Please Sir ! ' as a bad influence on the young . In the earlier programme , they took an interest in wildlife , here its old people and kids . The late Jack Woolgar specialised in playing cantankerous pensioners . ' Dr . Who ' fans will probably best remember him as ' Staff Sergeant Arnold ' in the 1968 classic ' The Web Of Fear ' . Funniest moment - Potter entering the 5C classroom wearing psychedelic boots !
401462	7743887	266202	6.0	The Last Gasp Of A Dying Format	With the boom in home video recorders in the ' 80's came a number of ' video review ' programmes , of which this was the last . Earlier examples of the genre include ' The Video Age ' with Patrick Stoddart , ' Re-Vid ' with Gary Crowley and Jon-Stephen Fink , and ' Video Video ' starring Adam Faith . ' Video View ' went out so late you needed a V . C . R . to watch the blamed thing , and was presented by blonde , husky-voiced Mariella Frostrup . Unlike say Barry Norman , Mariella didn't write the reviews , but delivered them in a sexy , confidant manner , while the camera prowled around the set at thigh-level . She only ever annoyed me once ; when ' Ghost ' won an award in 1991 as ' Best Picture Of 1990 ' , she quipped ; " I wouldn't be surprised if it wins it again next year . " . How on earth could a film made in 1990 be ' Best Picture Of 1991 ' in 1992 ? As the V . C . R . boom died down , satellite and then later D . V . D . took over , hence ' Video View ' was relaunched in 1993 as ' The Little Picture Show ' .
400929	7743887	80231	7.0	When Hammer Rose From The Grave	The last official ' Hammer horror ' film - ' To The Devil A Daughter - was released in 1975 . That seemed to be it . Five years later , this I . T . V . series appeared . Despite the title it was actually made by I . T . C . Entertainment ( ' Lew Grade's House Of Horror ' didn't have the same ring , I suppose ) . The thirteen episodes were a mixed bag , many relying on gore and nudity for their shock value , rather than well written stories . Easily the best was ' The Silent Scream ' starring the late , great Peter Cushing . Great final shot ! ' Witching Time ' was pretty memorable too ( because Patricia Quinn and Prunella Gee both got their kit off ) . But there was little of the essence of the movie series that had scared audiences for two decades . The strongest influence came from ' Thriller ' , an anthology made by A . T . V . in the early ' 70's . ' Guardian Of The Abyss ' was the most Hammer-like episode , bearing a resemblance to ' The Devil Rides Out ' ( 1968 ) based on the famous Dennis Wheatley novel .
401671	7743887	799445	7.0	" I've got a glass eye in a very funny place ! "	Series 3 of ' Please Sir ' concluded with Bernard ' Privet ' Hedges marrying the lovely Penny , and 5C graduating ( strangely we never saw them sitting exams , much less getting qualifications ) . Episode 1 of ' The Fenn Street Gang ' begins with a lengthy scene in a bowling alley which was clearly written to bring viewers up to speed on the Gang's activities ( Duffy must be a good friend to Craven . He allows him to leer suggestively at Sharon as she throws the ball ) . There's a lovely , touching moment as a pompous tannoy announcement provokes a cry of ' Nose ! Nose ! ' . Looking at one another , the Gang laugh . You can take the kids out of the school , but not the school out of the kids it seems . Concerned they might not see one another any longer , they arrange to meet up on Thursdays at eight in ' The Three Feathers ' pub ( presumably they have lied about their ages to get service ) . At the first such meeting , Maureen fails to show up . While the others grumble , she is hard at work in the hospital where she works as a nurse . An explosion in a glass eye factory means her services are required round-the-clock . On leaving the pub , Frankie traps his finger in the door of Duffy's van , and has to be hospitalised . Here the Gang realises the reason for Maureen's non-appearance . . . The first episode is more concerned with setting up the premise for the show , rather than being amusing in its own right . Its also one of the few to feature every Gang member - later stories would focus on individual characters , with the others appearing in supporting roles . Two cast changes occurred - Carol Hawkins replaced Penny Spencer ( fired after asking for a pay rise ) in that year's ' Please Sir ! ' movie , and stayed in the role throughout ' The Fenn Street Gang ' . Fans are divided over who was the best ' Sharon ' . I tend to favour sultry Spencer myself , though bubbly Hawkins was equally beautiful . Malcolm McFee was unavailable , so the role of ' Peter Craven ' went to Leon Vitali . Vitali lacked McFee's flair for sarcasm , and was just too similar to Peter Cleall's ' Duffy ' for his own good . Fortunately , McFee returned for subsequent seasons . Richard Davies makes a welcome guest appearance as the grumpy Welsh teacher ' Mr . Price ' . Spotting the Gang in a pub , he makes various rude comments , before accepting their invitation to join them . The day after this episode first went out , ' Please Sir ' kicked off its fourth and final series with ' Identitwit ' , in which Liz Gebhardt made a similar cameo . Spot the mistake - when the ' end of part one ' caption is on , someone walks past the camera ! Funniest moment - it does not involve the Gang . In the hospital scene , a man with his right arm in plaster attempts with difficulty to drink a cup of tea !

A baffled inspector suspects something is up when Stan invites him home for dinner , and turns up for work on time . Then the truth comes out . . . ' On The Buses ' ' answer to the Doris Day / Rock Hudson film ' Send Me No Flowers ' . Stan's eagerness to regain Blakey's friendship is rather touching , a reminder of past days as seen in ' Stan's Worst Day ' . Black comedy this ain't though . Its a little uncomfortable to watch now - Michael Robbins died of cancer in 1992 .

With an ally at the top , Jack thinks he has Blakey over a barrel , and starts pushing him about . . . Written by George Layton and Jonathan Lynn . Bob Todd of ' The Benny Hill Show ' guest stars as ' Mr . Simpson ' . Funniest moment - Blakey telling ' Jack ' to get out of his chair .

Anticipating elimination by Miss Dunner ( June Watson ) of Dept . K for double-crossing them , he got someone to put blanks in her gun . So now he is on the run , and sleeping with the recently widowed Mrs . Abigail Whitebait . Except that she is not - her late husband has just been brought back from the dead , thanks to Robag ( Aubrey Morris ) . Van Epp wants Scrotty resurrected because he has important information . . . One of Twin Peaks ' most popular characters was a dwarf . Well , ' The Corridor People ' ( often likened to David Lynch's surreal series ) had one too - ' Nonesuch ' ( William Trigger ) . In a truly startling scene , Van Epp - dressed as a nanny - pushes a pram through a park . Clouds of smoke issue from it . It contains no baby , but a cigar-smoking Nonesuch , who proceeds to shoot a man called Whitebait - who is supposed to be dead anyway . If all this makes sense , I cannot have explained it properly . I am not going to waste time attempting to rationalise the events of this bizarre show . That way madness lies . Scrotty gets more air-time here than in the previous instalment , and a right pain he proves to be too . Not merely content with openly bragging about having conned both Dept . K and Van Epp , he allows an innocent man to be eliminated just so he can resume carrying on with his wife . Van Epp's base of operations is in a disused theatre , allowing for Scrotty and her to have some fun with clown masks . ' Robag ' is that wonderful actor Aubrey Morris , who specialised in eccentrics .

Duncan turns detective in this episode , attempting to clear his name before it is too late . Dick and Joyce don't offer much help , and behave as though they think he might actually be guilty .

When Hedges ventures onto the roof to obtain a piece of brick , 5C lock the trapdoor behind him , ensuring they do not have to waste more time on the pointless project . Price , meantime , has had enough of 5C's refusal to learn and asks Mr . Cromwell for a leave of absence . The headmaster grants it , telling the other teachers he has gone to China to adopt six children . Hedges attempts to stand in for Price with little success as he knows nothing about science . The truth about Price's whereabouts are revealed when a television set is accidentally left switched on . . . Ah , school projects ! Remember them ? The perfect excuse for a morning or afternoon away from the classroom . In my case , our geography master Mr . Davies ( or ' Dai Geog ' as we used to know him ) would take us into the town square , where we would sit under the war memorial counting the cars and lorries as they went past . As soon as Dai's back was turned , several of our number would dive into the nearest newsagents and emerge moments later carrying Amazin ' or Super Mousse bars and cans of Pepsi . It was like having an early Breaktime . 5C aren't so lucky as their project takes place within the school grounds . Abbott goes up a ladder with a measuring tape , loses his balance , and accidentally smashes a window . An angry Potter appears on the other side . Thanks to Frankie , the headmaster's lavatory is now full of broken glass . 5C are impressed when Hedges tells them of Price's Chinese trip . Sharon likens it to the film ' The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness ' ( 1958 ) which starred Ingrid Bergman as missionary ' Gladys Aylward ' . Funniest moment - 5C watching Price on television . Instead of China , he is in Betws-y-Coed , at the Eisteddfod , where he is wearing Druid's clothes , singing ( in Welsh , naturally ) and playing the harp !

But who is discrediting them ? The last episode of Season 2 was also the last to be produced by John Howard Davies ; with its over-the-top arch-villain out to make a name for himself by building robot doubles of his rivals , it feels like an episode of ' The Avengers ' . Our heroes even find themselves in two ' inescapable doom-traps ' ! The gag about Julie Andrews going topless proved astonishingly prescient ; nine years , she did ' S . O . B .

Wolfgang Adolphus Ratphink Von Petal ' , complete with maniacal cackle , pet vulture and dressed in a Richard The Third costume . John Junkin had worked with Tim Brooke-Taylor in ' Its Marty ! ' . Peter Reeves supported ' Tommy Cooper ' in his 1969 L . W . T . series . Felix Bowness , seen here as a bookie , was a decade away from his role as jockey ' Fred Quilly ' in ' Hi-de-Hi ! ' .

401085	7743887	65205	8.0	Norman Throws Away The Cloth Cap	As the ' 60's began to swing , a sea change took place in British comedy . Family-oriented fare gave way to a much ruder , cruder style . The ' Carry On ' films were well placed to take advantage of this , but poor old Norman Wisdom found himself out in the cold . Determined not to be left behind , he co-wrote and co-produced this low-budget sex farce for Tigon Pictures . In it , he plays ' Timothy Bartlett ' , a meek , middle-aged businessman , happily married to Margaret , and a devoted father . En route to a banker's conference at the seaside , he gives a lift to a pair of free-spirited young women , one of whom is ' Nikki ' , played by future ' Bless This House ' star Sally Geeson . The girls annoy him at first , eating his sandwiches and urging him to overtake lorry drivers , but he winds up becoming infatuated by Nikki , and tracks her down to a discotheque . Sneaking her into his room , they wind up in bed , and over the course of the next few days he learns to love life again . Soon he is wearing trendy clothes and they are riding the Big Dipper at funfair's , dancing , and even skinny-dipping ! Timothy installs Nikki in a flat he has bought . But the fun ends when he finds her in bed with a younger man . Devastated , he accuses her of behaving like a whore . The relationship is over . Rather than go home , he sends for his wife , and behaves with her the same way he did with Nikki . ' Goose ' plays like a 60's version of ' Shirley Valentine ' with the sex of the main character reversed . Norman does not do drugs here thank goodness ( besides , he already had a trip in ' The Early Bird ' when he ate doped apples ) , but seeing him frollicking with a young woman must have been a tremendous shock to his fans . Some traces of ' Pitkin ' remain , however . When Timothy enters the disco , two men swinging from a rope Tarzan-style crash into him sideways . Locked out of his room , he climbs up the side of the hotel . The dialogue could have been a bit sharper . For a sex farce , there's surprisingly little innuendo . Its amazingly sweet-natured too . The film's main strengths are Norman's and Sally's performances , plus supporting roles from Derek Francis , Terance Alexander and Paul Whitsun-Jones . And a great soundtrack from Reg Tilsley ! ' Goose ' bridged the gap between the old school of British comedy ( in which accident-prone losers like Norman became winners ) , and the ' oo er missus ' stuff of the ' 70's , such as the ' Confessions ' series . Well worth a look .
400877	7743887	59143	8.0	Norman Catches The Worm !	Mention the name Norman Wisdom to many and the chances are the first thing they think of is of him in that ill-fitting ' gump ' suit , mugging frantically , falling over to the strangulated cry of ' Mr . Grimsdale ! ' . Comedy film fans may make the sign of the cross at his name , but the fact is he was the No . 1 British box office star for well over a decade . There is nothing pretentious about him or his films . You do not need to be ' in ' on the joke because there is nothing to be in on . Now it is very different - unfunny material can make millions for its creators as long as it is perceived to be ' cutting-edge ' . Norman's brand of knockout comedy was old hat even in his hey-day , owing a debt to silent era comics such as Chaplin and Keaton . But he soon put on his own stamp on the genre , finding out what worked for him and what did not . His regular ' stooges ' were Edward Chapman as his boss , the aforementioned ' Mr . Grimsdale ' , and long-faced Jerry Desmonde as the pompous authority figure whose side Norman becomes a thorn in . ' The Early Bird ' was the last time all three appeared together . It came along at a time when British film comedy was becoming less and less family oriented ( look at 1966's ' Doctor In Clover ' and compare it with the earlier Dirk Bogarde ones ) . Norman tried to move with the times by going into colour , and then parted company with his producer Hugh Stewart , who went on to make three pictures with Morecambe and Wise . Norman once more is ' Pitkin ' , this time a milkman for Grimsdale's Dairies , a small-town firm under threat from the much-bigger ' Consolidated Dairies ' . When he finds broken bottles on his round , it amounts to a declaration of war . Consolidated Dairies's top milkman is ' Austin ' ( Brian Pringle ) , and when they confront one another in a deserted street it is like ' High Noon ' all over again . " Little men like you do not stand a chance ! " , sneers Austin , before landing a nasty-looking punch to Pitkin's jaw . But when the ' little man ' is Norman , he is in with more than just a chance . Right , that's the premise established . What about the slapstick ? Well , Norman is dragged through Desmonde's garden on an out of control lawnmower , disguises himself as a vicar to gatecrash Desmonde's game of golf with ' The Colonel ' ( John Le Mesurier ) , eats doped apples intended for his horse Nellie ( a sequence more disturbing than all 75 minutes of Roger Corman's ' The Trip ' ) , falls downstairs goodness knows how many times , and manages to nearly demolish Consolidated Dairies's H . Q . No wonder Norman was offered the role of ' Frank Spencer ' before Michael Crawford . Corny ? Yes . But there's nothing wrong with corn . Despite the many fun moments , Norman's popularity was in rapid decline . His next picture - ' Press For Time ' - combined the knockabout stuff with a half-hearted attempt at political satire , and his 1969 offering ' What's Good For The Goose ' saw him shedding the cloth-cap ( along with everything else ) by jumping into bed with Sally Geeson of ' Bless This House ' . Whether you like ' The Early Bird ' depends on whether you like Norman , and to many he is simply is not funny . But he gave a lot of pleasure to an awful of people - including the entire population of Albania - and I suspect his cheap and cheerful movies will still be gracing Saturday afternoons long after the ' cutting-edge ' stuff has been forgotten .

V . cameras , enabling him to see every part of the school . Henry meets ' Droopy Draws ' ( as the boys refer to Miss Dropmore ) , and she turns out to be a stunning beauty . Immediately his crumpet-o-meter goes into overdrive . . . One of the first things to be said about ' Casanova 73 ' is that it does not feel like a Galton & Simpson show . There's none of the pathos of ' Steptoe & Son ' nor inspired humour of ' Hancock's Half-Hour ' . It feels more like the work of Talbot Rothwell , writer of numerous ' Carry On ' pictures . I'll give you an example . The headmaster tells Henry that his son justified his presence in the woods by claiming he was on an ornithological expedition ' to photograph tits ' . Ooh , double meaning ! Roger is a strange boy indeed ; his interest in his teacher being one of financial profit , rather than lust . He regards her as ' ancient ' even though she is only 25 ! How on earth did he manage to install a C . C . T . V . camera in her room without her knowing ? Though credited as ' guest star ' , the lovely Cyd Hayman ( you may remember her as ' Madame Cocotte ' from the ' Death Can Be Fatal ' serial in the fourth series of ' The Two Ronnies ) is only in one scene , where she comes over all prim and proper in Henry's presence , feeling that her right to privacy has been violated . He of course never tells her it was not a good idea to go skinny dipping in the vicinity of a boys ' school . Before you ask , no we do not get to see the photos . Erik Chitty a . k . a . ' Smithy ' from ' Please Sir ! ' plays the ' Sports Master ' ( if you can believe it ! ) . Funniest moment - Henry spinning his wife Carol a pack of lies concerning his behaviour the night before . Removing his shirt , his infidelity is revealed . In the heat of passion , the maths teacher had scrawled sums all over his back !
401485	7743887	968882	8.0	Triple Date !	Mrs . Tranmere , one of the passengers aboard the M . S . Begonia , is rich , American , and - how can I put this - has a fondness for crew members . On clapping eyes on Duncan , she falls for him . Her daughter , Susan , is also taken with the young doctor . Suddenly he finds himself on a simultaneous date not only with Mrs . Tranmere and Susan , but also Nurse Wynton . . . We've been here before , haven't we ? Bernard McKenna and Richard Laing's script effectively takes the plot of the ' In Charge ' episode ' Honey Lamb ' and shifts the location to sea . Once more poor Duncan is forced to dash around , lighting fags and pouring drinks , and come up with all sorts of daft excuses for leaving the women alone . Nedwell would do it all over again four years later in the opening episode of ' The Upchat Connection ' . Sandra Dickinson makes her second appearance in ' At Sea ' , she had earlier been seen ( as a different character ) in the ' Sir John & Baby Doc ' episode . Here she sports a red wig , possibly to distinguish her from Elisabeth Councell . Nurse Wynton's sudden interest in Duncan is a bit hard to take . Previous episodes had depicted her as rather independent and aloof , but now she behaves like a love-sick puppy . Still , Councell gets a lot of comic mileage out of her ' wronged woman ' routine . Funniest moment - it involves Councell , funnily enough . Smashed out of her mind , she drags Duncan to the ship's discotheque , and they begin dancing . Around the dance floor are bars like those found on cages . The music stops suddenly , and she is left flouncing about like a fool . To make her humiliation worse , Duncan rushes off , leaving her crying helplessly , her hands gripping the bars like a convict . Top marks to the actress for getting laughs out of a virtually laugh-free script .
401557	7743887	502943	8.0	" I'm a looney ! "	John Cleese , in need of money following a disastrous business venture , accepted Humphrey Barclay's offer to write several episodes of ' Doctor At Large ' in 1971 . Among them was the classic ' No Ill Feeling ! ' , later to inspire ' Fawlty Towers ' . Also that year Cleese penned this episode of ' Six Dates With Barker ' . Ronnie plays ' Dr . Swanton ' , a money-grabbing psychiatrist who gets a visit from the gas man ( Michael Bates ) . Only he is not really a gas man , but someone with dreadful psychological problems . He claims he is being followed everywhere by a little man in a Robin Hood hat with binoculars . Swanton tries to assure him the watcher is only a figment of his imagination , and appears to be having some success , but then , bizarrely , he starts seeing him as well . . . Remember the ' Argument ' sketch from ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' ? Blow that up into ten times its length and you have this . It is basically a two-hander with Bates ' character protesting he must be a looney and Ronnie's trying to persuade him he is not . As was the case with ' All The World's A Stooge ' , the joke wears off quickly and the episode is left all at sea . I loved the ending though ! Energetic work from the late Michael Bates as the paranoid gas man . I do wish Network would release ' Turnbull's Finest Half-Hour ' on D . V . D . as it featured one of his very best performances ( check out my I . M . D . B . review for my thoughts on the show ) . Funniest moment - Dr . Swanton trying to prove the imaginary man really exists by tipping him upside down .
400939	7743887	665444	8.0	Stan & Jack Have A Hot Time	Jack bets Stan a fiver he cannot last a day without a cigarette . Later that day , Arthur bets Stan a ten-pound note he cannot last a day without a cigarette . Stan tries to stem his craving by over-eating , but the addiction is too strong and he heads to the toilet to have a drag . Arthur appears on the landing , so Stan puts the burning cigarette in his mouth , eventually spitting it out . Arthur declares himself the winner of the bet . But what is he up to ? A recurring old sitcom plot device involved a major character attempting to win a bet by demonstrating ' willpower ' . In the ' Rising Damp ' episode ' Food Glorious Food ' , Rigsby tries to go a whole day without a meal , here its Stan yearning for a smoke . Years later , ' Father Ted ' did a variation on the theme , in ' Cigarettes & Alcohol & Rollerblading ' . The penultimate series of ' On The Buses ' begins in spectacular fashion , as Stan accidentally sets fire to a bus , which is completely gutted by the end . You'd think Stan and Jack would certainly get the sack for this , but no , the bus company can only claim insurance by attributing the fire to faulty wiring . So their jobs are safe . Funniest moment - Stan and Jack using part of a broken fence to rescue Blakey from the upper deck of the blazing bus !
401180	7743887	116118	8.0	" Its Time To Return . . . "	Since the triumphant return of ' Dr . Who ' to our screens in 2005 , fans have downgraded the 1996 T . V . movie from a ' disappointment ' to a ' disaster ' . Certainly it didn't lead to the expected follow-up series , but that was down to bad scheduling in the U . S . A . rather than the quality of the film itself . Over here it got nine million viewers ( an excellent rating for B . B . C . - 1 ) . The film's biggest mistake was to start with Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor . On landing in San Francisco in 1999 , he is shot by a drug gang and taken to a hospital where he dies - or seems to . In the mortuary , the ' corpse ' assumes a completely new form . Elsewhere , the Doctor's old enemy ' The Master ' has taken over the body of an ambulance driver , and plans to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations . Viewers who hadn't seen ' Dr . Who ' before were totally mystified . As McGann asserts his personality , the film becomes fun to watch . He's a terrific Doctor , and had the potential to be the best since Tom Baker , but it wasn't to be . Eric Roberts is a very different ' Master ' from the ones we're used to , but its a good thing . Daphne Ashbrook makes a delightful ' Dr . Grace Holloway ' , a character in the ' Liz Shaw ' mold . Yee Jee Tso's ' Chang Lee ' is great too . The interior of the TARDIS is a stunning piece of design , the S . F . X . are the best the show's ever seen ( faint praise though that is ) , and by and large the positives outweigh the negatives . But ' Dr . Who ' didn't impress the Americans , and back he went into limbo - until 2005 anyway .
401694	7743887	131158	8.0	" The best way to get people off the dole is to stop giving it to them ! "	One year after ' The Young Ones ' and ' The Comic Strip Presents ' launched a new wave of British comedians on an unsuspecting world , Granada T . V . brought out ' Alfresco ' . Despite starring Ben Elton , Stephen Fry , Hugh Laurie , Robbie Coltrane , Emma Thompson and Siobhan Redmond , it doesn't seemed to have burned itself into the national consciousness the way those other shows did , possibly because it felt more like a Channel 4 show than an I . T . V . one , and the obvious canned laughter killed many of the sketches stone dead . Beginning each week with a cheeky saxophone arrangement of ' I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles ' , ' Alfresco ' wandered widely between the borders of the inspired and the inane . Among the former was a spoof U . S . variety show , hosted by the giggly , vacuous singer ' Sherri ' ( Thompson ) who announces a tribute to The Beatles and manages to forget the drummer's name ( Ringo ) , Fry's pompous doctor unable to grasp why his Sikh patient is wearing a turban ( he thinks its bandages ) , and Thompson's fussy librarian revealing to bookworm Laurie the twist endings of the mysteries he intends to read . ' The Pretend Pub ' was a spoof soap peopled by oddballs with names like Ezzer , Bezzer , Lord Stezzer , Shizzer and so on . The off the wall humour Fry and Laurie later used in their own show was first in evidence here . Emma Thompson made the most impact on yours truly , mainly because she was stunningly beautiful . I can remember not finding Elton very funny though , sketch comedy was not really his forte , and he was overshadowed by the others . He would later find his niche with ' Saturday Live ' and ' The Man From Auntie ' . Critics at the time gave the show a pasting , one even renamed it ' Al-fiasco ' . It also came under fire from alternative comic Alexei Sayle . " Posh people can have anything they want . " , he said , " Even their own satirical show on Granada Television . " . Well , compared to the vile mess that was ' O . T . T . ' in which Sayle was a regular , ' Alfresco ' was ' Monty Python ' standard . Given that many of its cast went onto become major stars ( and Oscar winners in Thompson's case ) , its surprising how ' Alfresco ' has so far eluded a D . V . D . release .
400733	7743887	918015	8.0	" If that's a Scientologist , I'll serve him with chips ! "	Shelley's attempts to prepare a dinner party meet with continual interruptions ; first , a Jehovah's Witness rings the doorbell and refuses to go away , then an elderly neighbour called Mrs . Ratcliffe asks him to fix her shelf . Mrs . Ratcliffe is , unfortunately , senile , and thinks that all the women at that address - Mrs . H included - are on the game . Jim thinks up an ingenious way to get these time wasters off his back - he introduces them to each other . The party begins before Shelley has had time to clear up the flat , so his guests helpfully oblige by doing it for him . It ends in disaster . A row breaks out when two guests let slip that they have been having an affair . . . The final episode of Series 1 ( though as I've stated in earlier reviews it was not broadcast as such ) owes a small debt to the classic ' Porridge ' episode ' No Peace For The Wicked ' , though its nowhere near as funny . As the interruptions increase , so Shelley's anger rises , though he stops short of actually throttling someone ( as Fletcher did ) . Spot The Future Star : yes , that is Alan Rickman as the hippie-like ' Clive ' . The man who would go on to star in ' Die Hard ' , ' Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves ' and ' Galaxy Quest ' amongst other hit films is seen here in a minor role . A major problem is that we never actually see the blazing row the party degenerates into . We are simply told about it . Obnoxious Ned is present , and makes matters worse by lecherously winking at Trish and exclaiming : ' Everybody's doing it ! " . As the party takes place off-screen , we are thankfully spared a return appearance by David Pugh as ' Ned ' . One good thing to be said for it , I suppose . The best bits are Shelley's interaction with the Jehovah's Witness ( haven't we all wanted to tell them to go forth and multiply ? ) and Mrs . Ratcliffe . Funniest moment - Jim telling the former to leave the premises , adding that if he comes back he'll turn him into a pillar of salt !
400826	7743887	469592	8.0	The Joy Of Six	This half-hour documentary was screened by Channel 4 following a repeat of the final ' Prisoner ' episode ( ' Fall Out ' ) in 1984 , and has never been rerun by the station or made available on D . V . D . This is strange , seeing how it features interviews with many of the people responsible for the show , such as producer David Tomblin , directors Don Chaffey and Pat Jackson , set designer Jack Shampan , actor Alexis Kanner , script editor George Markstein , and , surprisingly , Patrick McGoohan himself . The filmed interviews were linked by actor Saul Reichlin , occupying a ' Green Dome ' style control room . No attempt was made to analyse the series in depth or interpret its hidden meanings , instead the show's history was presented in a straightforward fashion . Particularly interesting was Markstein's assertion that ' No . 6 ' was always intended to be ' John Drake ' of ' Danger Man ' fame , despite McGoohan's frequent denials . The man himself was , as you'd expect , non-committal , cheekily signing off with ' Be Seeing You ! ' .
400979	7743887	675785	8.0	Who Were You With Last Night ?	Following a wild party , Mr . Hedges wakes up half-naked in a strange bed , and with a dreadful hang-over . He is in for a shock - the bed belongs to Connie Eversleigh , mother of Sharon . Hedges manages to get to Fenn Street School , but spends the day in a terrible state , unable to focus on the lessons . Some time later , he overhears Sharon telling Maureen her mother is ' in the club again ' . Assuming the worst , he prepares to take responsibility by proposing marriage . . . The late Diana Coupland guests here as Sharon's good-time girl of a mother ' Connie ' ; two years later , she would be cast as ' Jean Abbott ' ( no relation to Frankie ! ) in that delightful Sid James sitcom ' Bless This House ' . Subsequent appearances by Mrs . Eversleigh in ' The Fenn Street Gang ' necessitated a spot of recasting - the role went to Barbara Keogh . Its thanks to Hedges ' innate decency that there is a plot here at all , most men would cheerfully turn their backs on the situation . Anyway , its all resolved happily at the end , with Connie revealing that the only club she is is the Christmas club . Funniest moment - to alleviate the hang-over , Hedges is given tinted owl-like glasses - and for a moment is transformed into Elton John !
400648	7743887	337780	8.0	Before ' K . 9 . ' There Was ' K . T ' .	Mild-mannered inventor Robert Sommerby lives in the country with his Aunt Millie , and a number of robots , one of which - ' Katie ' ( K . T . ) - is silver , talks like one of ' The Gumbies ' from ' Monty Python ' , and keeps leaving his arm behind on buses . The others could pass for human , though , such as Eric ( who sometimes walks around with a bag of frozen peas against his head to stop him overheating ) and Desiree , programmed to breathlessly declare her undying love for every man she meets . A couple of sinister foreign types are out to get hold of Sommerby's robot blueprints , and try every means at their disposal to get into his house . Every week they fail , but like Wile E . Coyote they never give up . ' Robert's Robots ' was Bob Block's follow-up to the children's comedy ' Pardon My Genie ' , and was every bit as funny . Nigel Pegrum , who played ' Eric ' , was familiar to children through ' Sing To The Animals ' and a couple of guest appearances in ' The Tomorrow People ' . The comic possibilities of robots was later explored in ' Red Dwarf ' .
401680	7743887	1079613	8.0	Paris - Cockney style !	The second episode of the second season of Douglas Livingstone's ' Born & Bred ' . Molly Peglar ( Joan Sims ) is planning a special Parisian night - complete with fashion show - at her East End pub ' The Crown & Sceptre ' . She hopes to impress enough people to give her a boost in her ambitions to chair the local Women's Committee . Ray and Marge Benge ( Gorden Kaye and Kate Williams ) are flattered to be asked to attend , only to then learn that she wants them only as domestic staff - her regular cook Mildred ( Mollie Maureen ) has walked out on her . Furthermore , as they are relatives , she does not intend paying them . Elsewhere , Frank Benge ( James Grout ) is scouring railway stations in an effort to locate his missing son-in-law Paul Redstone . He bumps into an attractive middle-aged lady named Mrs . White ( Hilda Fenemore ) who is engaged on a search of her own , to find her absent husband Freddie and find out why he ran off with the Guide Dog money . Frank likes her so much he suggests they have an affair , but she is not up for it . Said missing husband ( Milton Johns ) is to be found in Molly's pub ( posing as ' Mr . Green ' ) where he is painting the walls to resemble the Paris skyline . Molly becomes so fond of him she offers him the job of barman . On the big night , Mrs . White learns from Tommy Tonsley ( Max Wall ) that her husband is at the pub . Determined to get him back , she goes there . Pam ( Suzie Blake ) is meant to be one of the fashion models , but she hates the clothes she has been given and won't go on . The occasion looks set to be a disaster . . . One of the lovely things about this show was the naturalness of the humour . No out-of-place laugh lines , no big headed cast member trying to upstage the rest , and , best of all , no artificial sounding laugh track . Molly's growing fondness for Freddie is mirrored by Frank's interest in Mrs . White . The railway station scene has a nice ' Brief Encounter ' flavour to it . We are so used to seeing Hilda Fenemore as dowdy head-scarf wearing housewives it comes as a shock to see her , for once , playing a sexually desirable woman . As Frank , James Grout is , as ever , brilliant . Look at his pained expression when he comes home from work only to find newly-washed nappies all over the place . There appears to be little affection between him and his wife ( Gillian Raine ) hence his interest in the poetry spouting Mrs . White is entirely believable . Funniest moment - the hatch to the dumb waiter in Molly's pub opens to reveal not the expected dinners , but an embarrassed looking Ray , who had been attempting to fix the thing . Second funniest moment - Frank explaining to his baffled wife that ' Mr . Green ' is in fact Mr . White .
401068	7743887	563128	8.0	" Go and jump on a barbed wire trampoline ! "	Its Sunday , and Duncan is on duty at St . Swithins . Tired , hungry and depressed beyond measure ( its also his birthday , and everyone , Kate included , seems to have forgotten ) . Loftus cons him into paying for a ham salad , Dick is too busy chasing a young Australian nurse to notice his friend's's misery , and Gascoigne struggles to encase a man's leg in plaster . In short , a typical day at St . Swithin's . The penultimate episode of ' Go ' is a bit like the classic ' Porridge ' episode ' No Peace For The Wicked ' , in that its lead character desperately wants to grab some peace and quiet but keeps being disturbed . Robin Nedwell does a most effective job of conveying Waring's frustration at not being allowed to relax . Writers Rob Buckman and Chris Beetles had been doctors themselves and so , one presumes , they were able to draw on their own real-life experiences . With hardly a week going by nowadays without some trashy tabloid running scare stories about the N . H . S . being ' on the point of collapse ' , its interesting to look back and see that ' overworked and under-paid doctors ' are hardly a new phenomenon . Dick's attempts to chat up Nerida result in failure . The Australian nurse is going out with someone else , and treats Dick with undisguised contempt . This was the second time that this had happened in ' Go ' , the other occasion was when he powerfully desired ( and which man wouldn't ) Katherine Wright . One suspects that Humphrey Barclay was responding to criticism of the show's perceived ' sexism ' . In a funny sort of way , it paved the way for Stuart-Clark's decision to settle down and become a family man , which is how we saw him in ' Doctor At The Top ' . The lovely and funny Elissa Derwent , who appeared in an episode of L . W . T . ' s ' Billy Liar ' series , is given a surprisingly thankless role here as a student nurse . Funniest moment - Dick trying to chat up Nerida in a room full of used bedpans . His nauseous expression as he tries to woo the girl is hilarious . Thank goodness we still don't have Smellyvision !
401332	7743887	563038	8.0	Man Overboard !	Duncan and Dick settle down to life aboard the M . S . Begonia . They find the crew to be a mixed bunch - Captain Loftus is a virtual replica of his St . Swithins counterpart , the Purser is a snob who grovels after Captain Loftus constantly , the entertainment officer a manic depressive , but there's some consolation in the shape of sexy nurse Joyce Wynton . Loftus intends throwing a cocktail party for the rich guests , including the loudmouthed American Mrs . Tranmere , and wants his crew to be on their best behaviour . Unfortunately , Duncan's present behaviour is far from his best - he is suffering from seasickness . . . Following the previous transitory episode , this Bernard McKenna and Richard Laing one gets the new format fully established . Vomiting is a regular occurrence in modern comedies , but it was rare in ' 70's shows . We're spared the sight of Duncan throwing up on camera - this was a family show - but thanks to good acting on his part Nedwell manages to convince the audience that he is ill . Funniest moment - Dick attempting to get Duncan ready by walking him round the deck . Pausing for breath , Dick watches Duncan stagger off . A second or two later , we hear a splash . A sodden Duncan reaches the party , leaving puddles in his wake .
401294	7743887	63944	8.0	" What Are We Going To Do Now ? "	The line between genius and madness is a fine one , and no individual epitomised these extremes more effectively than Spike Milligan . The ' Monty Python ' team freely admit drawing inspiration from his shows . I never saw ' Q5 ' alas , but the later series - beginning with ' Q6 ' - were a mixture of the brilliant and banal . Like the Pythons , if Milligan tired of a sketch he'd cut it short . False noses and boot polished faces cropped up a lot . Then there was the well-endowed Julia Breck , whom Spike delighted in undressing on air . Spike himself never seemed to be able to get through a sketch without giggling . Amongst the highlights were a spoof ' The World About Us ' about the ' Cock-a-knees ' ( Cockneys ) , the ' Good Samaritan ' read from a pulpit by a police officer , the infamous Pakistani Dalek sketch , ' The First Irishman In Space ' , ' The Smallest Police Station In The World ' and Adolf Hitler doing a George Formby impression . You had to love Spike to love the show - and I did .
401235	7743887	202735	9.0	Charades On Television	A sketch in ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' had an out-of-work actor ( Griff Rhys Jones ) receiving bad news in the post . " Dear Sir " , it said : " We would like you to appear on ' Give Us A Clue ' . " . So horrified was the poor guy that he shot himself . What can one say about ' Give Us A Clue ' ? This Thames panel game was basically charades on television , with two teams of celebrities ( three men versus three women ) competing against one another to see who could come up with the outrageous mimes . It got going in 1978 , with Michael Aspel ( later Parkinson ) as host , Una Stubbs ( later Liza Goddard ) as one team captain , with a saluting Lionel Blair as the other ( my late father detested Blair with a vengeance , and hurled insults at the screen whenever he was on . ' Effeminate ' being a cleaned up version of his most frequently used one . My mother once pointed out that Lionel had fathered children , to which Dad sneeringly responded : " They're probably not his ! " . Ah , that man's rapier-like wit is sorely missed ) . Amongst the good sports ( or sad losers , depending on your view ) were Paul Henry ( ' Benny ' from ' Crossroads ' ) , Jon Pertwee , Joyce Blair ( Lionel's sister ) , Madelaine Smith , Michael Barrymore ( in the days when he was funny ) , Billy Dainty , Bernie Winters , Honor Blackman , Francoise Pascal , Gabrielle Drake , Roy Kinnear , Brian Marshall ( they were probably short of people that week ) , Alfred Marks , and Harry H . Corbett . The early shows included members of the public as team members . I do not know where they got these poor sods from , but they managed to be fairly useless . A man made a right berk of himself one night miming his own name . He had read the wrong side of his card ! Warren Mitchell went on once , and , slipping into his ' Alf Garnett ' persona , rebuked Una ( she had a charming habit of sticking her bottom in the air when miming - no wonder I loved the show ! ) in no uncertain terms . When Warren read the title of his next mime , the studio ( those privileged to see what it was ) erupted in laughter . It was ' Mind Your Language ' ! On a sadder note , the great Marty Feldman made one of his last television appearances on this show . Recently returned from the States , ( following his sacking by Universal studios ) , he looked haggard ( he sported a beard ) and unwell . Though Lionel introduced him as ' that genius of comedy ' , Marty's heart was just not in the game . He could barely raise a smile . It was sad to see him in such a dreadful state . One of the early shows featured Libby Morris ( forgotten now , but a very funny lady in her day ) trying to mime International Rugby League . I cannot do justice to her performance , but the harder she worked at it the more confused the team got . When she finished I had tears rolling down my face . Another wonderful performance came from the tough guy-actor George Sewell , who had to do ' The Virgin Soldiers ' . He got ' soldiers ' right , but just how do you convey virginity in mime ? He had a good go though , putting his lips to his fingers to denote innocence . ' Clue ' ran for years , surviving ( as previously pointed out ) a change of host and team captain . An attempt by the B . B . C . to revive it some years back as an early morning show did not work out . The early editions boasted a catchy but familiar sounding theme tune by the talented Alan Hawkshaw . I say familiar because it was the same as the B . B . C . ' s children's show ' Grange Hill ' ! I never found out how it came to be used on two shows broadcast at the same time on different channels . Thames later replaced it with an original composition by the equally talented Denis King .
401026	7743887	68096	9.0	" Joan ! The subject is closed ! "	I think its sad that this show has been so misunderstood . People who weren't even alive in the ' 70's will tell you with absolute authority that it was ' racist ' and ' should never be shown again ' . Yet how many of them have actually seen an episode ? True , ' Love Thy Neighbour ' was about a racist - Eddie Booth - but it was no more an endorsement of his ridiculous views than ' Fawlty Towers ' a televisual guidebook on hotel management . Jack Smethurst was superb as Booth , a walking contradiction of a man who purports to be socialistic , yet his attitudes are pure Enoch Powell . I used to live in a neighbourhood where there were a lot of West Indian families , and you should have heard the laughter coming out of these houses when this show was on . Before condemning it outright , critics should take the trouble to watch it and see who comes out on top every week . It certainly isn't Eddie . If anyone was foolish enough to laugh along with him , that was their fault , not the show's .
401558	7743887	1200523	9.0	The Second Day	Its C-Flight's second day at R . A . F . Skelton - the conscripts are made to rise at the ungodly hour of five-thirty , and enter a freezing cold washroom . Finding a flick-knife in Smith's pocket , Marsh threatens to put him on a charge . Smith claims it is his razor , and to prove his point shaves with it , resulting in nicks galore . Smith sells the Corporal a packet of lace hankies , which he gives to wife Alice . Following breakfast , the lads are packed off to Supply Stores to collect their kits . Returning to their quarters , Ken loses his , and frantically searches for it . It has been returned to Supply Stores , but L . A . C . Hodder refuses to hand it back - he is far more interested in girlfriend June . A furious Marsh demands a new kit for Ken . While Hodder packs one , Marsh finds a lace hankie on the floor , and wrongly assumes Alice is being unfaithful . . . A terrific episode , one that gives Marsh a chance to show a little humanity ( he sticks up for Ken when he loses his kit ) . Ken's display of concern for Marsh's wellbeing is both believable and touching . The late Clive Hornby , future ' Jack Sugden ' of the soap ' Emmerdale ' , appears as ' L . A . C . Hodder ' . Note the excited reaction of the studio audience when Ken catches sight of the R . A . F . Regiment quarters . Obviously there were one or two ex-R . A . F . conscripts with long memories present . We will see more of the drunken , violent Regiment in future episodes . Funniest moment - Marsh dispensing Lilley's kit . I cannot do justice to it here , but it is a wonderful scene and rightly earns Tony Selby applause .
401088	7743887	665425	9.0	Cold Turkey For The Butlers !	1971 saw ' On The Buses ' reach its peak in terms of popularity . Season 4 spilled over from the year before , bringing many fine episodes like ' Cover Up ' and ' Not Tonight ' . The release of the first movie , which became the highest grosser in the U . K . Season 5 appeared in the autumn , and was lapped up by a grateful public . To those perplexed by the popularity of this show , the answer is this - not only was it funny , but the characters were so well depicted the viewers came to think of them almost as friends . We have all met or know of a cheeky chappy like Jack , an over-protective parent such as ' Mum ' , and a frumpy housewife akin to Olive . Bossy authority figures such as Blakey continue to exist to this day ( unfortunately ) . The year was rounded off by this enjoyable episode , in which Arthur's mother and sister Linda come to stay with the Butlers for a week . Linda is attracted to any man she meets ; she immediately has the hots for Jack , and later Stan ( technically , this is incest , but we'll let that pass ) . At the Boxing Day Social , Arthur tries to keep Jack and Linda apart , and urges Olive to intervene . But she gets drunk and after a blowsy clippie shows interest in her husband makes an exhibition of herself . Taking Mrs . Rudge around the buses , Blakey is horrified to find Stan and Linda in one , the latter minus her tights . . . Helen Fraser plays lascivious ' Linda ' ; best known to comedy fans as ' Lil ' in the Lampwick sketches in ' The Dick Emery Show ' , and ' Dr . Mary Bingham ' in ' Doctor In Charge ' . Though she is excellent here , she went on to belittle ' On The Buses ' in an interview published in ' T . V . & Satellite Weekly ' in 2005 . " It was a terrible show . " , she said . " Goodness knows why it was so successful . " . And this from one of the cast of ' Bad Girls ' . Funniest moment - Olive getting drunk at the Social , and trying to show Arthur up by lifting her skirt . Good thing she remembered to put underwear on that morning . Complements of the season to all I . M . D . B . users ( even those who hate me ) , and , in particular ' Jackm-15 ' and ' Deathmark VIII ' . Keep those splendid reviews coming , fellers !
400870	7743887	60857	9.0	" Holiday resort ? This is the last resort ! "	Following ' The Early Bird ' in 1966 , Norman Wisdom split with producer Hugh Stewart ( who went on to bring Morecambe & Wise to the big screen ) , and teamed with Robert Hartford-Davis and Peter Newbrook , later to make exploitation pictures such as ' Incense For The Damned ' and ' Corruption ' . Norman's first work for them was a cameo as a boxing priest in the Michael Bentine comedy ' The Sandwich Man ' . ' Press For Time ' was the second Norman Wisdom film ( the first being ' Girl On The Boat ' ) to be adapted from a published source - in this case Angus McGill's ' Yea ! Yea ! Yea ! ' . I have never read it , so cannot comment . Norman plays ' Norman Shields ' , a Westminster newspaper seller . In a nod to the Peter Sellers comedies , he also plays a number of members of the Shields family , including the current Prime Minister , a doddery old fool obviously based on Harold Macmillan . The Tories are in power ( unlike the real 1966 , where Harold Wilson was residing at No . 10 ) . The P . M . pulls strings to get Norman a job as reporter on ' The Tinmouth Times ' , a local paper in a seaside town in the West Country . No sooner has he gotten off the train than he becomes embroiled in a war between ruling Labour Mayor Aldeman Corcoran ( Derek Francis ) and the editor of the ' Tinmouth Times ' , Tory M . P . Major Bartlett ( Derek Bond ) . Norman falls for glamorous reporter Eleanor ( Angela Browne ) , but she ( unsurprisingly ) is disinterested , reserving her charms for the Major . In anticipation of the Tory sex scandals of the ' 90's , the Major is also having it away with his secretary Ruby ( Tracey Crisp ) and rigs a beauty contest so that she will win . Of course Norman is having none of this and changes the result , favouring Corcoran's mousy daughter Liz ( Frances White ) . The trouble with the film is that the political satire sits uneasily alongside Norman's familiar brand of slapstick . Norman's plea for harmony from the major parties is , as you would expect , contrived , but there is a very funny scene at a council meeting , and the first speaker is the legendary Stanley Unwin , the man who raised gibberish to an art form . The seaside town setting , the cynical manipulation of the democratic system by self-centred politicians , and the trampling-on of local concerns were themes explored in an earlier British movie - Tony Hancock's brilliant ' The Punch & Judy Man ' . Other classic Norman ' moments ' include him flying backwards through the air when a bundle of newspapers comes his way , getting his bike caught on a light fitting , the destruction of a house on a newly-built estate , the afore-mentioned council meeting degenerating into a fight , and the collapsing of a stage full of local dignitaries . Best of all is Norman's commandeering of a double-decker bus in the pursuit of his stolen bicycle . The sped-up footage is accompanied by a jaunty Mike Vickers tune , features lovely old Gordon Rollings as the conductor , and must rank as one of the best scenes in any Wisdom picture . Norman dispensed with his regular supporting players Edward Chapman and Jerry Desmonde , bringing in the likes of Allan Cuthbertson and Peter Jones , but alas , time really was up . His next appearance on the big screen would be an Oscar-nominated supporting role in ' The Night They Raided Minsky's ' in 1968 . He tried his hand at a sex comedy a year later in ' What's Good For The Goose ' , but it was no use . The movie-going public had had enough . He then moved to television - ' Norman ' , ' Nobody Is Norman Wisdom ' and ' A Little Bit Of Wisdom ' , all for A . T . V . Though the last of these ended in 1976 , Norman has rarely been off the box since , thanks to the continued popularity of his films with successive generations .
400717	7743887	750481	9.0	Charlie Meets E . T . !	Finding an extra-terrestrial being in his back garden one morning , Charlie does what any right-thinking person in the same situation would do - he takes it to the Employment Exchange . Mr . Pugh thinks Charlie is playing some bizarre practical joke , but when the E . T . begins melting plastic objects such as pens and a phone , he is reduced to a gibbering , thumb-sucking wreck . Charlie and the E . T . head for the nearest park , where their attempts at communication are mistaken for busking . His hat full of coins , Charlie realises he is on to something . At the London Palladium , crowds of people queue to see a show , and are unexpectedly entertained by Charlie and the E . T . doing their plastic melting act . . . The late Charlie Drake belongs firmly in that category of British comedians whom you either love or hate . The naysayers bracket him in with Norman Wisdom as a typical example of a smug comic who played safe and never took risks with comedy , while his admirers hold him up as a fine example of a knockabout comic who could entertain millions without feeling the need to use profanity or expose parts of his anatomy . Personally , I belong in the latter camp , when Charlie was on the box you could not drag me away from it . Though he was no Chaplin , his slapstick comedy was consistently inventive and amusing . This was one of the last ' Worker ' episodes made , and though until recently I hadn't seen it for nearly forty years I was surprised at how much I remembered . The E . T . looks like what it was - a woman writhing around inside a white sack - but as this is a comedy I did not feel remotely insulted by the cheapness of the S . F . X . Possibly the plastic eating aspect was inspired by the opening episode of the B . B . C . ' s sci-fi drama ' Doomwatch ' , broadcast in January of that year . The ending - in which the E . T . falls in love with a pillow case on a washing line and changes itself into one - is curiously touching as well as absurd . Amongst the people lined up outside the Palladium is Marcia Warren , later to play the nosey ' Vera Botting ' in the William Gaunt sitcom ' No Place Like Home ' . Funniest moment - Charlie asks a young woman if the coat she has on is plastic . " Certainly not ! " , she snaps , " It is leather ! " . The E . T . soon exposes her lie , however , by melting it , leaving her fuming in her underwear !
400914	7743887	501328	9.0	" They said it couldn't happen here . But it has ! "	The third episode of ' 1990 ' is a different kettle of fish ; it has more plot than the earlier ones combined . Charles Wainwright ( Ray Smith ) , a union leader , is sent to America by the P . C . D . to promote their cause , but instead makes a powerful speech roundly condemning them . The Home Secretary ( John Savident ) has Wainwright sent to an A . R . C . ( Adult Rehabilitation Centre ) for ' correction ' . Kyle helps his dissident friends break into the Centre to try to reverse the damage wrought by Dr . Gelbert's drugs , but to no avail . Wainwright's next appearance on television features a completely changed man ; denouncing his earlier broadcast , the union leader goes on to announce his retirement in favour of a P . C . D . - backed puppet . Like I said , quite different to the earlier Wilfred Greatorex-scripted editions . A sympathetic trade union leader was a rare sight on British television in the late ' 70's , as they were being demonised by the right-wing media at the time as ' the enemy within ' . Whenever you saw a photograph of say Len Murray in ' The Daily Mail ' , he was made to look like something out of ' Aliens ' . The writer here is Edmund Ward , who along with Greatorex wrote several fine episodes of ' Man In A Suitcase ' . His other credits include ' The Power Game ' and ' The Main Chance ' . Ray Smith is excellent as ' Wainwright ' , although it is hard to understand why he goes back to Britain after his American speech . Surely he would have guessed what the P . C . D . would do to him ? His recantation is difficult to accept too ; it is obviously coming from the lips of a man whose mind has been tampered with . The P . C . D . could have achieved the same effect by merely discrediting him , making it look as though he were on the take for instance . The idea of there being secret establishments for brainwashing political undesirables was first seen in ' The Prisoner ' . John Rhys-Davies , later to play ' Sallah ' in ' Raiders Of The Lost Ark ' , plays Wainwright's replacement . No much for the Delly Bird to do here , alas . No wonder Babs Kellermann left after the first season . It could not have been much fun playing a woman so completely devoid of personality .
401380	7743887	55231	9.0	An Overlooked Gem !	' The Night We Got The Bird ' turned up on Channel 4 one afternoon a few years ago . Never having seen it before , I tuned in . It was hysterical ! Brian Rix plays a nervous young man who marries Dora Bryan , formerly engaged to a disreputable antiques dealer played by Ronald Shiner , who'd died after being chased by the gangsters to whom he owed money . Brian and Dora's wedding night is disrupted by the presence of a caged bird which , little do they know , is the reincarnation of Shiner ! This bizarre story was partly scripted by legendary farce specialist Ray Cooney , and as you'd expect contains plenty of good lines and amusing situations . I burst out laughing when Irene Handl purchased a toilet seat made to look like a valuable antique mirror . The supporting cast are great too , amongst them Leo Franklyn , Liz Fraser , and of course the magnificent Irene Handl . Why this film isn't better known is a mystery . The same production team also made the army comedy ' The Night We Dropped A Clanger ' , with Rix playing dual roles .
400846	7743887	956739	9.0	Dennis In The Dock !	Left to his own devices one evening in the pub , Dennis falls in with a group of leather-jacketed hoodlums . After plying him with drink , they rob a chocolate machine . The police show up ( how efficient the boys in blue were back in 1971 ! ) , and arrest them . Poor Dennis goes up before the local Magistrate . But help comes from an unexpected source . Two of his former teachers , Mr . Price and Mr . Smith , are there , and Smithy's impassioned plea for clemency bores the beak so much he lets Dennis off with a small fine . . . There was two-way traffic between ' Please Sir ! ' ' s last season and ' The Fenn Street Gang''s first , with characters cropping up in both shows . While the former was struggling to cope without ' Hedges ' and ' 5C ' , the latter was coasting along nicely - mind you , most of its cast was from ' Please Sir ! ' , so this was not surprising . ' Price ' had previously worked his Celtic magic in ' Should Auld Acquaintance ' . ' Smithy ' alas was confined to this Tony Bilbow-scripted episode . Regrettably , ' Potter ' , ' Miss Ewell ' and ' Cromwell ' did not appear in the show . Chocolates machines ( along with cigarette machines ) were a common sight on Britain's streets in the ' 60's and ' 70's . They were abolished because people kept on robbing them ! A good episode , although Peter Bayliss seems a bit wasted here . David Janson , who plays one of the thugs , would go on to star in Esmonde and Larbey's ' Get Some In ! ' . The beak is Geoffrey Bayldon , who played ' Catweazle ' in the hit children's show for L . W . T . Funniest moment - Smithy's outraged face as the beak refers to him as a ' teddy boy ' !
400840	7743887	956748	9.0	" I never had that fight with Sean Connery ! "	Invalided out of the army , Frankie is unemployed , and takes to the streets in his ' private eye ' gear . After seeing Craven driving his new scooter , Frankie is jealous . Attempting to steal a car , he crashes it . Put on probation , Frankie is asked the whereabouts of his father by an inquiring officer . Even Frankie himself does not know . Overhearing his mother tell her friend Shirley the truth , Frankie sets off to the Labour Exchange where Mr . Abbott works . . . Written by Frankie's alter-ego David Barry , this is one of the best episodes of the show . Predictably , it focuses mainly on Frankie and his appalling mother , with minor contributions from fellow Gang members Eric , Craven , and Dennis . But it does not get boring . On the contrary , Frankie's character is explored with a depth unseen before on screen . It appears that Mrs . Abbott's insanity started when her husband walked out on her , and she inadvertently passed it onto her only child . When Frankie tries to find his Dad , he is shocked at what a pathetic figure he is and rushes to his friends for sympathy . He even owns up to being a liar . Needless to say , his reformed character does not stay reformed for long . That Barry could write a script equal - if not better - to many of the Esmonde / Larbey shows is really quite an achievement . Spot the mistake - Shirley accidentally referring to Vera Abbott as ' Barbara ' , the real name of the actress playing the role . Funniest moment - Frankie receiving his new scooter . To his horror , he turns out to be a child's one !
400893	7743887	803378	9.0	The barbarians are at the gates of Fenn Street . !	Hedges ' latest plan to turn 5C into towering intellectual geniuses is the creation of a library , open after school hours and supervised by Potter . The caretaker isn't keen on the idea though . With him out of the way , the class are free to use the place for non-curricular activities , such as smoking and drinking . The teacher works out what they are up to and leaves behind a message on the library tape recorder , promising to throttle them using the elastic from Maureen's knickers . Hearing this , they flee from the room . More trouble comes when Hedges finds the place vandalised , and wrongly assumes that 5C are responsible . Duffy and co . track down the real culprits - a gang of yobs from 5B , led by Graham Webster , out for revenge for having earlier been brutally evicted from the library by Duffy . With a visit from the Board Of Governors imminent , Hedges tries to get the room tidy in time . . . Very good episode this . I well remember my own school library and what a joy it was to be asked to help catalogue the books therein - it usually meant a welcome respite from normal English lessons . I took dozens of books home with me , most on the subject of space exploration and astronomy , causing my teacher to assume I would become a rocket scientist when I left school . Things did not work out quite as planned - I became a chef instead ! All the cast are put to good use here , particularly Deryck Guyler's ' Potter ' and his suspicions that 5C might be smoking ' that Carnaby rubbish ' ( cannabis ) . I would love to know how 5C managed to smuggle the crates of beer into the school though ! Funniest moment - Hedges ' blustering attempts to keep the bigwigs out of the library . Second funniest moment - the look on his face when his recorded message is replayed in front of them !
400635	7743887	641204	9.0	Terror In An English Village	Dying peripatetic agent John Gilsen ( John Carson ) has information that could put one of the world's biggest drug networks out of business for good . Naturally , they are not happy about this , so their killers pursue him relentlessly across the globe . Peters ( James Villiers ) , the head of the network , comes up with a novel idea to smoke Gilsen out . He dispatches the champagne-swigging biker Lucas Guardino ( Derren Nesbitt ) along with other assorted hoods to Gilsen's home - a small English country village - to create an atmosphere of terror . Each night , locals are roughed up , property is damaged , and fires started ( sounds like my home town on an average night ! ) . The police force consists of one tubby bloke ( Norman Mitchell ) on a bike , so the bad guys have a field day . They then go one step further by hiring MacGill ! Mac's investigations draw a dead end , the locals are uncooperative . He does not know why his employers want Gilsen so badly , but when a Scotland Yard detective named Hedley ( Gerald Sim ) and C . I . A . agent Kane ( John Brandon ) show up in the area , he begins to have doubts about their motives . . . Another good Edmund Ward episode . Unusually violent for the time , with Mac on the receiving end of another beating and in the climax the locals turn on the gangsters , pulverising them ( nothing like a good old fashioned lynch mob when it comes to meting out some honest justice , is there ? ) . Peters , unlike your average drug pusher , enjoys a high standard of living - quaffing expensive food and drink while making philosophical speeches about the nature of drug addiction : " They ( the addicts ) are on a stupid trip to a dreamland that doesn't exist . And we sell tickets ! " . Another strong cast - John Carson was in ' The Gilded Cage ' episode of ' The Champions ' and the Hammer classic ' Plague Of The Zombies ' amongst other things , James Villiers was the ' Chief Of Staff ' in the 1981 Bond movie ' For Your Eyes Only ' , Derren Nesbitt was ' New Number Two ' in ' The Prisoner ' adventure ' Its Your Funeral ' , and Noel Howlett , well cast as a Vicar , went on to play ' Mr . Cromwell ' in the sitcom ' Please Sir ! ' . Larry Martyn ( credited here as ' Martin ' ) was ' Mr . Mash ' in ' Are You Being Served ? ' . Filmed in the village of Fulmer , some 2-3 miles from Pinewood . It was also seen in ' The Persuaders ! ' and the underrated ' Strange Report ' . Gerald Sim's ' Hedley ' reappeared in another ' Suitcase ' exploit - ' Burden Of Proof ' - also penned by Ward .
401069	7743887	563076	9.0	" I think we have made a hideous mistake ! "	While Loftus awaits to be officially confirmed for a knighthood , he receives some surprising news from his wife . She is bored at home and wishes to return to full-time nursing . He is dead against the idea , but she goes through with it anyway . Lady Cornford's daughter , Annabel , also wishes to be a nurse at St . Swithins . On her first day , she meets Duncan , and they are mutually attracted to each other . But she accidentally lets slip that she had dined with Loftus a few nights before . Duncan jumps to the wrong conclusion . A wicked rumour spreads round the hospital that Annabel and Loftus are conducting an affair . . . Angharad Rees had played ' Frances ' in the ' Doctor In The House ' episode ' Getting The Bird ' , here she returns as a different character . ' Annabel ' would make several appearances in the second season of ' Charge ' . This episode is more like a Whitehall farce , with misunderstandings piling on top of misunderstandings , angry wives , and pretty girls in their underwear . But its one of the best written episodes of the entire series , and the cast throw themselves into the piece with commendable enthusiasm , even if the notion of Loftus as ' Casanova ' is a little hard to swallow , and Richard O'Sullivan's ' Bingham ' is utterly wasted . Funniest moment - Loftus ' anger on finding Waring with Annabel .
401328	7743887	182580	10.0	Ray and Alan's Funhouse	Its rare for writers ' names to be incorporated into the titles of their shows - even Johnny Speight never managed it - but by 1977 , Ray Galton and Alan Simpson had engendered enough respect and affection from within the industry and general public for it to occur . Their faces were to be seen in the opening titles , with Ken Jones ' brass-band signature tune incorporating the clicking of typewriter keys . The series got off to a magnificent start with ' Car Along The Pass ' , boasting Arthur Lowe in sparkling form as a pompous xenophobe trapped in a cable-car over the Austrian Alps with assorted foreign tourists . His opening line to wife Mona Washbourne summed up his character : " This is the worst holiday we have ever had . . . we have both spent over £18 each . " . With ' Dad's Army ' about to end , it looked as though Arthur had a potential solo hit on his hands , but it was not to be . None of the ' Playhouses ' made it to series form , some such as ' Naught For Thy Comfort ' and ' Variations On A Theme ' seemed written purely as stand-alone affairs . ' Swap You One Of These For One Of Those ' was a left-over from ' Casanova 73 ' ( hard to credit it now , but ' The Sun ' complained before its broadcast that wife-swapping was not suitable for television ! ) . Another outstanding show ' I Tell You Its Burt Reynolds ' featured Leonard Rossiter as a buffoon who becomes convinced he has spotted the macho movie star in a T . V . show . His madness escalates , and Rossiter turns in his best performance since Rigsby . ' Big Deal At York City ' was good fun too , with Warren Mitchell as a lucky soul who's had a good day at the races , only to be preyed upon by card sharks on a train . Neat twist at the end . The seven shows were as good as any of their past work , had high production values , and were wonderfully cast . ' The News Of The World ' invited readers to select the episode with the best series potential . What the result would have been we shall never know , because Alan Simpson retired suddenly , leaving Ray to team up with Johnny Speight . However , they reunited briefly in the mid-90's to update some of their material for Paul Merton . For a farewell , ' Playhouse ' was not at all bad . A D . V . D . release would be more than welcome .
400936	7743887	65105	10.0	Alf Garnett - This Is Your Life !	No sooner had the television version of Johnny Speight's controversial B . B . C . sitcom ended - temporarily , as it turned out - than the cast reunited for this feature film spin-off . Interestingly , it sets itself up as a prequel , initially featuring Alf and Else in London's East End during the Forties . We see Alf here as an eccentric patriot , rather than the tyrant bigot he became . Over news reel footage of Nazi tanks he boasts that Hitler is too scared to go to war with Britain . But it happens , and suddenly he is terrified . He believes it won't last long though . His patriotism vanishes the day the call-up papers land on his doormat . The attention to period detail here is marvellous ; rationing books , air-raid shelters , doom-filled radio broadcasts , they're all here . Much to his disgust , soldiers are tucking into bacon and eggs while he has to make do with spam . The pub runs out of beer , and Alf cannot fill his pipe with tobacco . Though he manages to stay out of the army by being in a reserved occupation , he has other problems to contend with - Else is pregnant . The second part takes us to 1966 ; mini-skirts are in fashion , and Alf comes into conflict with his trendy lefty daughter Rita and her ' Scouse git ' boyfriend Mike Rawlins . Alf won't let her put ' Vote Labour ' posters in his window . This section is not as good as the first , but it is nice to see the circumstances that brought the characters together . There is a hilarious scene at Rita's wedding reception when Alf gets into a fight with Mike's father , a devout Catholic . Amongst the cast is future ' On The Buses ' stars Michael Robbins and Bob Grant ( even though the latter has no lines ) . Norman Cohen must have liked working in the wartime period as he went on to direct the film version of ' Dad's Army ' and ' Adolf Hitler My Part In His Downfall ' , based on Spike Milligan's memoirs . Bill Maynard plays ' Bert ' , Alf's next door neighbour , with whom he conducts conversations whilst on the toilet ( how well I remember outside bogs . Ugh ! Cold ! ) . It is impossible not to feel sorry for Alf as he walks up the street where he has lived for years , now deserted . For many people , this was a reality . Hitler could not destroy the street , but the local council did . The movie ends where it began - in a cinema - with Alf standing as the National Anthem plays , everyone else having gone home . Released in America under the title ' Alf ' n Family ' ( presumably to capitalise on the connection with ' All In The Family ' ) , it was so successful it opened the floodgates for other sitcom-based films such as ' On The Buses ' and ' Dad's Army ' . A sequel - ' The Alf Garnett Saga ' - was made three years later , but it was not a patch on the first .
401488	7743887	80306	10.0	" Humphrey , are you trying to wish me a Merry Christmas ! "	JIM HACKER : Bernard , Sir Humphrey is not God ! BERNARD WOOLLEY : Will you tell him or shall I ? When I first saw ' Yes Minister ' many moons ago , my initial reaction was : " This will never catch on . It is too good . " . Making fun of politicians on television was not new then , of course - ' T . W . 3 ' ( which Antony Jay contributed to ) did it two nearly decades earlier - but this was , I think , the first time anyone had done it on this scale , albeit with fictional rather than real ones . The premise is this ; the well-meaning but naive Jim Hacker ( Paul Eddington ) is appointed Minister of Administrative Affairs . Though he has sound ideas , such as cutting government waste and ending bureaucracy , he is undermined at every turn by Sir Humphrey Appleby ( Nigel Hawthorne ) . Jim is basically a figurehead , the real power lies with unelected civil servants . The show got much comic mileage out of the elusive gobbledegook spouted by politicians , and skilfully avoided naming Jim's party . but I think there was no doubt in anyone's mind as to which one it was . The superb titles featured caricatures of the cast done in his inimitable style by Gerald Scarfe . Ronnie Hazlehurst's theme was suitably bombastic , if a little similar to the one he did for ' To The Manor Born ' . Along with Jay , the other writer was Jonathan Lynn , an ex-cast member ( and contributing writer to ) L . W . T . ' s ' Doctor ' series . Together they came up with some outstandingly literate scripts , which were then impeccably delivered by the cast . Hawthorne's ' Sir Humphrey ' in particular was a marvellous comic creation , being charming and sinister at the same time . Hacker's habit of turning into Churchill regularly creased me up . Derek Fowlds likewise was hilarious as ' Bernard Woolley ' , who , while not actually stupid had an unfortunate habit of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time . The show caught on , won dozens of awards ( particularly for Hawthorne ) , and was a surprise hit in Australia . I suppose that it was because politicians are much the same wherever you go . I do not know how accurate this depiction of British politics is . If , as was alleged , Ministers are nothing more helpless puppets in the hands of skillful manipulators such as Sir Humphrey , then the democracy in which we live is a sham . This subversive ( not to say depressing ) message could not have hit home with the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who pronounced herself a fan , and even participated in a specially-written sketch at which Mary Whitehouse was in attendance . Eddington and Hawthorne were not keen to do it , apparently , feeling she was exploiting the show's success . One of the best episodes was ' Skeleton In The Cupboard ' in which Sir Humphrey's involvement in an old scandal comes to light . It was fun to see the tables turned for once , as poor Humph breaks down in front of the Minister . In another , Jim and Humph were at a reception in the Middle East ( where alcohol is not allowed ) and kept sneaking off to a fake communications rooms to imbibe . But easily the best episode was ' Party Games ' , an extended special which finally propelled Hacker into No . 10 . Everything about it , from Jim using a minor issue ( the E . U . ' s renaming of sausages ) as a crusade to the blackmailing of potential Prime Ministerial candidates , felt right . Ludovic Kennedy obviously struggled to keep a straight face during the interview . Three seasons were made , followed by a sequel ' Yes , Prime Minister ' which was , in my view , not as good . Eddington and Hawthorne are sadly no longer with us , but fortunately the repeats are . Unlike other sitcoms of the period , this has not in any way ' dated ' . Its themes are as relevant as ever . With all the hoo-ha over honours recently , it seems strange no-one has questioned as to how Jay got a knighthood ( as well as co-writing ' Minister ' , he also penned speeches for Thatcher ) while Lynn did not . Surely he is just as responsible for the show's success ? Perhaps him being openly left-wing had something to do with it . I will leave the last word to an outraged ' Points Of View ' letter-writer . When the first season was being repeated , he / she wrote to Barry Took's show to complain , adding : " If this is the way the country is being run , I would rather not know about it ! " .
400647	7743887	83505	10.0	" Dear Mister Echo . . . "	' The Young Ones ' polarised audiences when it first appeared in 1982 , if you were over thirty you regarded it , as Malcolm Allison did , ' utter rubbish ' , but if you were under thirty you loved it ! I have to admit I was not an immediate fan , but took to it after several viewings . ' The Young Ones ' was all about four students - hippie Neil , punk Vyvian , wide boy Mike , and hyperactive Rik , who never seemed to do any studying . They lived in a house where incredibly surreal things happened , such as the furniture talking to itself , or atom bombs dropping through the roof . The characters weren't likable , but then they weren't meant to be . Alexei Sayle cropped up from time to time as their landlord , Mr . Balowski . The humour was aggressive , violent , and very rude , more so than any show had been before . My favourite gag was when Vyvian leaned out of a moving train , only to be instantly decapitated . We then saw his headless body pull the communication cord , get out , and run up the track ! Some aspects have undeniably dated ; for instance , a ' Dallas ' spoof contained the credit : VITRIOL CONSULTANT - MISS NINA COW . This was a dig at the television critic Nina Myskow , who was one of ' Dallas ' most vocal supporters . The ' tampon ' gag in an early episode caused a sensation . Full credit for this show must not only go to the performers , but also to writers Rik Mayall , Lise Mayer ( whatever happened to her ? ) and Ben Elton ( who appeared occasionally ) . It is difficult to think of another comedy show that captured the spirit of the ' 80's so successfully .
401693	7743887	98850	10.0	" My name is Ben Elton . Goodnight ! "	When Anne Robinson made that now infamous ' Room 101 ' appearance , she lambasted Ben Elton for ' selling out ' - becoming part of the showbiz establishment he had spent much of his career railing against in shows such as ' Filthy , Rich & Catflap ' - the Forsyths , the Tarbucks , the O'Connors etc . A clip from The Royal Variety Performance in which he urged the audience to cheer Her Majesty The Queen was screened , adding weight to her argument . During his ' Saturday Live ' days , Elton would have cut off his right arm rather than be complementary about the wealthy and privileged . ' The Man From Auntie ' ran for two seasons ( one in 1990 , another in 1994 ) and featured the man at his silver-suited , ranting best . Each week , there'd be a ' Farties Guide ' in which he took a wry look at aspects of modern life ( one very good item was about student digs ) , interspersed with fierce attacks on the British political system ( as expected , Mrs . Thatch and later John Major came in for the Elton treatment ) , topical gags , and surreal sketches in which upside-down shots of Ben's mouth were turned into such comic characters as a sex-starved student and a Mary Whitehouse lookalike . ' Mastermind ' was parodied ( Michael Portillo being depicted as a contestant ) and ' The Oprah Winfrey Show ' . But sketch comedy was not his forte ( he lacked the range to be an actor ) and it was the stand-ups where he came into his own . He got into trouble , however , with a witty monologue about contraception in which he used the then-taboo word ' fanny ' . Outraged viewers impatiently waiting for ' Question Time ' inundated the B . B . C . with complaints . Unlike Rory Bremner , Elton could make a political statement , no matter how basic , and still manage to be funny . One episode ended with a John Major lookalike catapulted into a canal . The huge cheer from the studio audience spoke volumes about the popularity of the Tories in the mid-90's , that is to say , not popular at all . Elton used up much of his stand-up material on this series , so it wasn't surprising that he cut it short after only two runs . By the time of ' The Ben Elton Show ' , Tony Blair's New Labour was in power and predictably , the fire went out of Ben's comedy . In recent years , he has concentrated on novels ( including the brilliant ' Popcorn ' ) and hit stage-shows such as ' We Will Rock You ' . Elton seems to have become a victim of his own success . Audiences don't laugh at millionaires . ' The Man From Auntie ' deserves to be remembered as a snapshot of a particular moment in British history . When the Royal Family was reeling from a wave of high-profile scandals , when the Major administration looked increasingly frail , when Ben Elton was a spokesperson for a lost generation . It seems unlikely but one hopes that in the unfortunate event of David Cameron becoming Prime Minister someday , Ben can find a way out of the television wilderness and back onto our screens to do what he is best at - bashing the Tories .
401021	7743887	101049	10.0	Two Men And An Ampersand	Amidst the ' alternative ' comedy chaos of the ' 80's , ' A Bit Of Fry & Laurie ' arrived almost unnoticed . Unlike ' The Young Ones ' , it had no ambitions to ' tear up the rule book book of comedy ' , but simply to present funny , surreal sketches . ' Not Only But Also ' was undoubtedly an influence ; highlights included ' Its A Wonderful Life ' starring Rupert Murdoch , ' Kickin ' Ass ' , and the ' Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy ' send-up with Fry as a Smiley-type intelligence boss who comes out with such cryptic phrases as : " You know I can't stick The Department up my arse , George . " . Another notable feature were the vox pop sequences . As a double act , Fry and Laurie were peerless . After three excellent seasons , the show moved to B . B . C . - 1 for its final run , which predictably became bogged down by guest-stars such as Caroline Quentin . The pair then split to pursue successful solo careers . It would be nice to think that they might come together again some day to give us more of their offbeat brand of humour .
401619	7743887	73990	10.0	" Are We Going To See The Hippopotamus On Sunday ? " .	Not many British sitcoms have been inspired by novels . In 1976 , David Nobbs adapted ' The Death Of Reginald Perrin ' for the B . B . C . . He had Ronnie Barker in mind for the title role , but ultimately ( and rightly so in my opinion ) it went to Leonard Rossiter . ' Perrin ' is a serial not a series . The premise is this : middle-aged Reginald Iolanthe Perrin is stuck in a dead-end job ( marketing executive at ' Sunshine Desserts ' ) . After accidentally referring to his mother-in-law ( whom we never see ) in his wife's presence as a hippopotamus , his life changes . He fantasises about all the things he would love to do , such as making love to his secretary Joan Greengross ( Sue Nicholls ) on top of her desk , exposing himself to his neighbour , and standing up to his boss , the domineering Charles Jefferson ( known as ' C . J . ' ) , brilliantly played by John Barron . C . J . ' s office contains chairs that fart whenever you sit in them . Eventually , Reggie fakes his death by leaving his clothes on a beach . After attempting a new life in various guises , he returns to his old one as bearded ' Martin Wellborn ' , and remarries wife Elisabeth ( Pauline Yates ) . But he grows bored of ' Wellborn ' and reverts back to plain old Reggie . C . J . , angry at having been deceived , sacks him . The series struck a chord with the public , and soon its catchphrases ( ' I didn't get where I am today ! ' , ' Great ! ' ' Super ! ' etc ) were heard all over the country , in workplaces and playhouses . As a schoolboy , I identified with Reggie because I too was trapped in a cycle of boredom ( and my headmaster was a dead ringer for C . J . ) . The second season saw Reggie , fired from ' Sunshine Desserts ' , setting up his own company - Grot - which sells rubbish to the public . It takes off , making Reggie a multi-millionaire . But success brings him down and , this time with Elisabeth in tow , he discards his new life ( along with his clothes ) . The clamour for more ' Reggie ' led to a third and final season , in which our hero decides to create a better world by setting up a commune , run by his family and friends . Though it had its moments , it was the weakest of the trio , mainly because Reggie now had nothing to rebel against , and only when was he rebelling was he truly funny . The series ended with Reggie working for C . J . ' s twin brother F . J . at ' Amalgamated Aerosols ' , and planning to do the same thing all over again . . . I cannot praise this highly enough . Both the writing and acting were of a uniformly high standard throughout , with Rossiter's ' Perrin ' becoming one of the all-time great television comedy characters . That the series was being made at the same time as ' Rising Damp ' is nothing short of remarkable . It is hard to see any similarity between ' Perrin ' and ' Rigsby ' . The supporting cast - including Geoffrey Palmer as Reggie's mad right-wing brother-in-law ' Jimmy ' , John Horsley as the befuddled ' Doc Morrissey ' , Tim Preece as Reggie's wine-making son-in-law ' Tom ' , and Sue Nicholls as ' Joan ' were all great too . I cannot end without mentioning Ronnie Hazlehurst's theme tune . Great ! Super !

After being stung by insults from Duncan concerning his medical prowess , he decides to prove he is good at something , and cleans Loftus out . Duncan uses his day off to visit sunny Medeiros , where he is reunited with his old flame Rosita . They spend some time in each other's company , eating ice creams amongst other things , before he goes back to the M . S . Begonia . A terrible pain in his side strikes him down . Dick diagnosis the condition as appendicitis . As they are out at sea , the anaesthetist has no recourse but to operate . . . One of the best ' At Sea ' episodes , penned by Layton & Lynn . Some very good continuity , as events as far back as ' In The House ' are referred to . Duncan and Dick are at loggerheads for most of the time ; the latter wishes to remove his friend's appendix , but the former is horrified at the thought of Dick coming at him with a scalpel in his hand . " I have never lost anyone during an operation . " , Dick tells him . Duncan replies : " That's because you've never been allowed to do any ! " . Duncan's agony is matched only by Loftus ' - though it is down to gout , rather than appendicitis . Poor Duncan has to stagger round the ship , asking passengers whether or not they are medically qualified . He is relieved to find one such man - alas , he turns out to be a vet . Nice location filming here . Robin Nedwell clearly enjoyed himself on the shoot . As it turns out , Duncan has not got appendicitis after all , but food poisoning caused by one of Pedro's famous ice creams . Funniest moment - Duncan and Rosita running towards each other in slow motion . Then a waiter carrying a dinner tray blunders into their path , and the food goes everywhere ,
401219	7743887	56777	10.0	" We are controlling transmission ! "	' The Outer Limits ' is often mentioned in the same breath as ' The Twilight Zone ' as one of the peaks of ' 60's television science fiction , and with good reason . The shows have a good deal in common , both are anthologies based partly on published fiction and original works . Both were made in glorious monochrome , feature top-drawer actors of the day , and still stand up well nearly fifty years later . ' Limits ' was the creation of Leslie Stevens , but the man who produced the first season ( and wrote many classic episodes ) is most frequently credited with its success . He was Joseph Stefano , writer of the screenplay of Hitchcock's ' Psycho ' . Stefano was responsible for establishing that each episode should have a ' bear ' - his nickname for a monster . He also hired Conrad Hall to create the show's distinctive lighting effects , while the special effects ( good for the time ) were by Projects Unlimited . It goes without saying that a modern audience would probably find the ' bears ' hilarious , but the series did not depend entirely for its impact on monsters . In ' Limits ' you will find something closely approximating the poetry of science fiction . Each episode opened with the picture blurring , while an announcer warned that the set was now under ' their ' control . It was a gimmick designed to invoke comparison with the famous Orson Welles ' War Of The Worlds ' radio broadcast ( written by Stevens , incidentally ) which conned many into believing a real alien invasion was underway . Stand-out stories include ' A Feasibility Study ' in which an American town is transported to an alien planet , ' The Zanti Misfits ' sees the arrival on Earth of hideous bug monsters with human-like faces , ' The Bellero Shield ' has a devious woman attempting to exploit alien technology for her own ends , ' The Man With The Power ' features Donald Pleasance as a man able to destroy anyone at will , in ' The Production & Decay Of Strange Particles ' ( great title ! ) atomic power triggers terrifying transformations in people , ' The Galaxy Being ' ( the show's pilot ) sees a radio ham accidentally making contact with a creature from the Andromeda constellation , ' The Forms Of Things Unknown ' has David McCallum as the inventor of a ' time tilting ' machine constructed out of hundreds of clocks . Somewhat out of place was ' The Hundred Days Of The Dragon ' , a conventional spy yarn in which the Red Chinese kill the President of The United States and replace him with an impostor , but it was gripping nevertheless . The impressive list of guest-stars included Barry Morse , Robert Culp , Carroll O'Connor , Leonard Nimoy , Robert Duvall , Sally Kellermann , Martin Landau , Sam Wanamaker , Warren Oates and Cliff Robertson . Special mention must be made of Dominic Frontiere , whose powerful music underlined the show's atmosphere of mystery and horror . ' Limits ' proved a surprise hit , and plans for a second season was laid . But when the network announced a change of time slot , Stefano resigned in protest . A new producer - Ben Brady - was appointed . Fans do not hold the second season in high regard , but a number of episodes , such as the two-parter ' The Inheritors ' , Harlan Ellison's ' Soldier ' and ' Demon With A Glass Hand ' , are as good as anything to be found in the previous year . Unfortunately , the new time-slot lost ' Limits ' viewers and it was abruptly cancelled . It appeared on I . T . V . ( usually in a late-night slot ) in the mid-'60's , and in 1980 , B . B . C . - 2 ran both seasons ( often jumbling up the episodes in haphazard fashion ) in one bumper run where it acquired a new audience . As a result of the success of ' The X-Files ' in the 1990's , ' Limits ' was resurrected by cable television . Some of the original shows - including ' I Robot ' , ' A Feasability Study ' and ' The Inheritors ' - were remade . The special effects were predictably better but alas little else was . The nudity it could have done well without . Luckily , both seasons of the original are out on D . V . D . and serve as a timely reminder of the greatness of ' 60's science fiction .
401422	7743887	56749	10.0	" Dad , I've got it wrong again ! "	I once accompanied my late uncle on a Saturday afternoon shopping trip . As we strolled around the centre , we spotted a smartly dressed man carrying a handbag ( they were briefly fashionable in the early ' 70's . In the ' To Alf A Grandson ' episode of ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , Mike ( Tony Booth ) is seen with one ) . I was prepared to say nothing , but my uncle came out with out with " Hello , Honky Tonk , how are you ? " . The man ignored the jibe , and carried on walking . He was probably used to it . A few shoppers laughed . I for one was deeply embarrassed . That was one of many catchphrases employed by the popular comedian Dick Emery , whose B . B . C . - 1 show was a fixture of Saturday night television for the best part of two decades . He was not strictly speaking an impressionist , rather than copy famous people , he had his own repertoire of outrageous comic characters , among them the buck-toothed ' The Reverend Chislet ' , a bespectacled spinster called ' Hettie ' whose determination to get a man knew no bounds , ' Ton-Up Boy ' , the lovable old codger ' James Maynard Kitchener Lampwick ' , ' Gaylord Screwsby ' , the bovver boy ( often accompanied by his similarly attired father , played by Roy Kinnear , who would try without success to give his son a masterclass in crime ) , the upper-class tramp ' College ' , camp-as-a-row-of-tents ' Clarence ' , and not forgetting sex-pot ' Mandy ' ( whose favourite saying was ' ooh you are awful , but I like you ! ' ) . Each week , these characters inhabited sketches usually written by John Warren and John Singer , beginning with a vox pop scene on film , in which a typically B . B . C . interviewer ( the late Gordon Clyde ) stopped passers-by to ask questions . Encountering Mandy , he wound up being pushed backwards into a hedge . It is impossible to make grand claims for Emery's show as being groundbreaking , but it was certainly amusing in a seaside postcard sort of way . A lot of hard work went into the show , what with Emery playing most of the roles , and viewers appreciated it . My favourite sketches featured him as ' Bert ' , an incompetent D . I . Y . man who invited his best friend Wol ( Reg Lye ) to his house whenever he wished to show off his latest creations . Once , he converted his coal cellar into a men's drinking club complete with bar and pool table ( which naturally fell apart when they tried to play on it ) . Another time Bert built his own film studio . Pat Coombs was often cast alongside the comedian , as his curler-headed neighbour . All together now : " Oo-er ! " . Emery's show attracted impressive guest-stars such as Kate O'Mara , Yootha Joyce , and David Jason . ' Lampwick ' , the old codger with the throaty chuckle , lived with his beloved daughter Lil ( Helen Fraser ) and her husband Ernie ( Victor Maddern ) , whom he did not get along with . So popular was he that the B . B . C . at one point contemplated giving him his own spin-off series . However , in 1981 , sensing that the format was becoming stale , Emery turned the show into ' Emery Presents ' , a six-part comedy thriller serial , of which two ( ' Legacy Of Murder ' and ' Jack Of Diamonds ' ) were made , the last of these transmitted posthumously as the star died in 1983 . We shall never know whether or not he would have stayed successful or been consigned to the dustbin of history along with so many other old school comics . In recent years , edited versions of his shows have been appearing at odd times on ' U . K . Drama Daytime ' on Sky T . V . It would be great to see his entire output on D . V . D . Emery may not have been groundbreaking , but was in his own way influential . Publicising his new B . B . C . series ' Harry Enfield's Television Programme ' in 1990 , the star admitted to having been a huge fan of Emery's when he was younger ( preferring him to ' Monty Python ' ) , and confessed that his show was a carbon-copy of his idol's . Emery may have been awful , but we liked him !
400880	7743887	72289	10.0	Wilder & Newhart - What A Great Team !	Sometime in the early ' 80's , an industrial dispute resulted in the last-minute cancellation of my favourite show ' Minder ' . In its place I . T . V . screened a U . S . T . V . movie I had not seen before : ' Thursday's Game ' . I watched mainly because it starred Gene Wilder and the equally wonderful Bob Newhart ( if you have never heard his comic monologues , you owe it to yourself to do so ) . Wilder is ' Harry Evers ' , producer of a daytime game show called ' Let's Chance It ! ' . The ratings are dropping so , expecting cancellation , he goes to see an employment officer ( Nancy Walker ) with a view to putting himself back on the job market . Initially , she tells him that getting a new job will be easy . She then finds out she has read the wrong resume . Reading the correct one , she does not look happy . Harry's worst fears are confirmed . He is unemployable . The highlight of Harry's week is his Thursday night poker game with his buddies , among them Marvin ( Newhart ) , owner of a successful fashion empire . One night , the game erupts into a fight when a losing player refuses to pay Harry what he owes him . Determined to keep the tradition of the wife-free Thursday night alive , he and Marvin begin going to theatres , cinemas , and bars . Marvin is also going through a mid-life crisis - he wants to divorce his much older wife Lois ( Cloris Leachman ) but is afraid to do so in case she tries to top herself . Harry approaches Ann ( Valerie Harper ) with a view to an affair , but cannot bring himself to go through with it . Then disaster strikes - his wife Lynne ( Ellen Burstyn ) finds out the game ended months ago , and thinks her husband is cheating on her . . . This was made in 1971 but went unscreened until 1974 , possibly to cash in on Wilder's popularity in the Mel Brooks movies , as well as Burstyn's role in ' The Exorcist ' . The studio executives who did not like it must have been watching with their eyes shut . ' Thursday's Game ' is a warm , funny comedy which encompasses adult themes such as marriage , divorce , redundancy , depression , adultery , and above all friendship . Unusually for a comedy of this kind , James L . Brooks ' script is not shot through with unrealistic one-liners , the humour arises naturally out of the characters and situations . Wilder is fabulous , only going over the top when he has to . When Harry is fired , he sits there stone-faced listening to the squeak of his chair before casually trashing his ex-boss ' office . Newhart's big moment comes when Marvin tells Lois he wants a divorce over dinner in a busy New York restaurant , and she suffers a bout of hysteria , predating the most famous scene in ' When Harry Met Sally ' by almost two decades . The chemistry between the stars is wonderful . Funniest moment ? Its when Harry goes to see his agent ( Rob Reiner ) and is stunned to find the man does not know who he is , despite him having been paid ten per cent of Harry's salary each month for four years . Harry's rage is hysterical to watch . At the end , Marvin , now a free man , goes off to Europe , and you find yourself almost wishing Harry would go with him . But Harry's loyalty to his family is too strong . ' Thursday's Game ' is hard to track down , but for fans of Wilder and Newhart or anyone just wanting a good laugh it is well worth the effort .
401368	7743887	56960	10.0	" This Never Happened To James Bond ! "	Charlie Drake's previous films - ' Petticoat Pirates ' ( 1960 ) and ' Sands Of The Desert ' ( 1961 ) failed to set the world on fire , but with ' The Cracksman ' he came up with a little beauty . He plays master locksmith Ernest Wright , who becomes the unwitting dupe in a series of robberies . As you'd expect from a Charlie Drake comedy , there's plenty of slapstick , but also an unexpected element of pathos - when Wright gets out of prison and his former friends shun him , its a genuinely moving moment . The gang's plan is a little unbelievable ; they seem prepared to wait years for Ernest to acquire a criminal record , but its done so well you don't really care . George Sanders is his usual smooth self as the gang's leader , while Nyree Dawn Porter shows a real flair for comedy . In addition , the script manages to squeeze in parodies of ' Dr . No ' and ' Birdman Of Alcatraz ' . The prison scene features Ronnie Barker as a prototype ' Norman Stanley Fletcher ' . A cracker of a comedy !
400970	7743887	60566	10.0	The Jokers Are Wild !	I love ' Swinging London ' movies ( real ones that is , not spoofs such as ' Austin Powers ' ) and ' The Jokers ' is a good example . It was directed by the much-maligned Michael Winner during what might be termed his ' golden age ' , the era of ' The System ' , ' You Must Be Joking ! ' , ' Hannibal Brooks ' , and ' I'll Never Forget Whatsisname ' . Having been booted out of the army for cheating during a training exercise , Michael Tremayne ( Michael Crawford ) decides to get even with the British establishment by making an extravagant gesture , hence he and brother David ( Oliver Reed ) execute a brilliantly conceived scheme to steal The Crown Jewels from the Tower of London . They plan to elude justice by leaving letters with solicitors stating that their intention was not to permanently deprive the Monarchy of their beloved trinkets ( apparently , this loophole in British law actually exists ) . The public takes the thieves to their hearts ( echoes of The Great Train Robbers ) . But then something goes wrong . Unbeknowest to David , Michael did not submit his letter , leaving his brother to take the blame for the theft . . . Though Winner came up with the basic idea , the script was penned by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais , then fresh from their successful B . B . C . sitcom ' The Likely Lads ' . There is little of the humour of that show here , but it is witty and engaging . In the aftermath of the robbery , various members of the public are interviewed by a television news reporter . One man says he is not sorry for The Queen as she can ' always put in an insurance claim ' . A holiday maker ( Frank Finlay ) jokingly tells Customs officers that he has nothing to declare ' except the Crown Jewels ' . But the joke backfires as the officers proceed to dismantle his car ! As the Tremayne brothers , Crawford and Reed are great . They are rich , good-looking , and popular with the débutantes so by rights you should hate them , but you do not . In fact you find yourself hoping they will get away with it . Surprisingly , the stars only worked together one more time - 1981's Walt Disney romp ' Condorman ' . Great supporting cast - James Donald as a dimwitted army colonel , Harry Andrews as Scotland Yard's finest ' Inspector Maryatt ' , and Brian Wilde as his incompetent sidekick ' Sgt . Catchpole ' . Warren Mitchell , Edward Fox , Daniel Massey , William Mervyn , and Julian Holloway are also in evidence . The jokers preface their theft by staging a hoax bombing campaign in the London capital , credited to ' Red George ' . Unfortunately , a few years later , bombs started going off there for real , courtesy of the I . R . A . , hence it was a good thing this was made when it was . Winner's brisk direction perfectly complements the amusing script and deft performances . There's also a lively soundtrack by Johnny Pearson . My only complaint is that there was never a sequel : ' The Jokers Strike Again ! ' in which the Tremaynes go after the Mona Lisa !
400711	7743887	756974	10.0	" Beauty Queen Shocks Council ! "	Naive , small-time thief Lennie Godber spends his first night in H . M . Slade Prison , in the company of Norman Stanley Fletcher . He is naturally nervous , but Fletcher gets him through it by telling him to pretend that he is having a ' quiet night in ' . As the doors are locked and the lights dim , the two men swap views on a variety of subjects . . . Its often been said that the simplest , most effective form of drama is the frank exchange between characters of widely differing viewpoints trapped in a lift or marooned on a desert island . That approach works well for comedy too . Here Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais take a young , wet-behind-the-ears Brummie criminal and pair him off with an older , hardened Cockney lag . The script is , as one would reasonably expect , top notch and is performed to perfection by both Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale . Apart from a brief appearance by Paul McDowell ( a regular on ' Dave Allen At Large ' ) as a prison guard , its virtually a two-handed piece , as good as anything you will find in the theatre . Poor Lennie badly misses his girlfriend Denise and reminisces at length about their sexual past . Fletcher urges him to forget her , then is fascinated by a topless Page 3 girl in ' The Sun ' . Godber is such a charming , intelligent young man its hard to see what drove him to crime in the first place . From his cell mate , though , he gets a masterclass in the fine art of prison survival . ' Porridge ' had only been on air for two weeks when this episode aired , but it had already achieved the status of ' comedy classic ' . Funniest moment - Fletcher repeatedly stepping on Godber's darning needle !
400625	7743887	140733	10.0	And The Verdict Is . . .	Daytime television in the U . K . didn't used to be about make over shows , ' Loose Women ' , and confrontational programmes of the ' Jeremy Kyle ' variety . Back in the ' 70's , we had ' Crown Court ' , a series of intelligently written courtroom dramas , starring the cream of Britain's acting talent . The secret of the show's success lay in its simplicity ; we rarely saw what was going on in the outside world , all we knew of the respective cases was what we heard from the witnesses , and that was enough . The jury was chosen from members of the public , who'd then deliver a verdict based on the evidence . Perhaps the most disturbing case was ' Destruct , Destruct ' in which a sci-fi obsessed juvenile suffocates a boy with a plastic bag . Every time the camera focused on the accused , we'd be privy to his thought processes , which consisted of weird electronic noises . In 1976 , Granada revamped ' Crown Court ' , putting it out on Saturday nights in hour-long shows . It didn't work , however , and soon returned to its natural habitat .
400599	7743887	944389	10.0	" You do not get crocodiles in the ocean ! "	The sitcom for which the late Terry Scott is best remembered is , of course , ' Terry & June ' , in which he co-starred with June Whitfield . However , from 1962-68 , he was partnered with the wonderful Hugh Lloyd in the David Croft-produced ' Hugh & I ' . As was the case with ' Hancock's Half-Hour ' , Scott and Lloyd played characters with the same names as themselves ; the former was a social-climbing bachelor , always on the lookout for fame and fortune , the latter his dim-witted lodger . They resided at Scott's mother's house at 33 Lobelia Avenue , Tooting , south London . Each week , Terry would dream up a new ' get-rich-quick ' scheme , only for it to fail dismally , mainly because of Hugh's bungling . Viewers took to the show immediately , in no small part due to the ' Laurel & Hardy ' style partnership at its heart . The scripts were by John Chapman , later to pen another classic Terry Scott sitcom - ' Happy Ever After ' . In the opening episode - ' Fully Incomprehensive ' - Terry decides to start his own insurance agency , after reading in ' The Times ' of the huge profits made by other companies . To find out the mechanics of the business , he and Hugh visit a real insurance agency , under the guise of Terry taking out a policy on his friend . But the manager , noticing Terry's substantial girth , tries to persuade Hugh to take out a policy on him instead . After placing a sign advertising their new business over their front door , Scott and Lloyd receive a visit from their neighbour Mr . Crispin , who threatens to report them . Terry counterattacks by threatening to report him for breeding ferrets in his kitchen . Desperate to sign their first client , Terry and Hugh visit the Wormolds , a senile , accident-prone old couple , but nothing comes of it . They then talk the manager of the insurance company into taking out a policy , but as he leaves the house , Terry's sign falls on the man's head , thus necessitating an immediate claim . ' Hugh and I ' will come as a shock to anyone accustomed to ' Terry & June ' . Scott's character is pompous , snobbish , and unashamedly rude . Watch Scott in the ' Bless This House ' movie to get an idea what this character is like . The irreplaceable Patricia Hayes crops up as ' Mrs . Wormwold ' , with Cyril Smith ( no relation to the ex-Liberal M . P . ) as her husband . Following Smith's unexpected death , he was replaced by Jack Haig . The combination of Scott and Lloyd's ' Stan and Ollie ' double-act , John Chapman's witty scripts , and the fine supporting players made ' Hugh & I ' a smash hit in the 1960's . I have only seen one episode , but would very much like to see more . Funniest moment - Terry and Hugh trying to erect their sign . " Put the hammer in my waistband ! " , Terry commands from the top of the ladder . Hugh does so , but places it upside down , leaving the head of the hammer freely dangling from Terry's trousers . Ouch !
401056	7743887	166396	10.0	" Lucky sods ! "	Good British film comedies are rare these days , but every now and then someone manages to come up with a cracker . Ten years ago , ' Waking Ned ' , written and directed by Kirk Jones , was just such a movie . Set in the town of Tullymore ( population : 52 ) on the coast of Ireland , it concerns two old friends , Jackie O'Shea ( Ian Bannen ) and Michael O'Sullivan ( David Kelly ) who , on discovering that a local person has scooped a colossal fortune on the Lottery , set about trying to discover the identity of the winner . Suspicion even falls on Jackie himself at one point . The lucky man is one Ned Devine . Visiting him at his cottage , Jackie finds him dead in front of his television , having succumbed to a heart attack as the result of shock brought on by his win . Ned had written his name on the back of the ticket . Not wishing to see the money go unclaimed ( it was a Rollover week ) , Jackie persuades Michael to try and pass himself off as Ned . But will the man from the Lottery be fooled ? Its a simple idea , yet written and performed to perfection . The cast are marvellous , particularly the late Scottish actor Ian Bannen as ' Jackie ' . He gets the Irish accent to a tee and he and David Kelly make a great comic team . Kelly is probably best remembered for his role ( which never did him justice in my view ) as ' Albert Riddle ' in the long-running I . T . V . sitcom ' Robin's Nest ' . James Nesbitt crops up as the pig farmer ' Pig Finn ' , unhappy because the lovely Maggie won't let him near her on account of the fact he stinks of pigs . The humour is natural , not forced as with a lot of other comedies . If the idea of a close-knit community where everyone knows each other's business and gets on well with neighbours seems far-fetched , take it from me - such places exist . I lived in Ireland for a time , and the film's depiction of the country and its people is accurate . There are many moments of laugh-out loud comedy to relish , such as the sight of Michael riding his motorbike in the nude , and Michael finding a chicken leg on Ned's floor and mistaking it for his intestines ( or ' intest-ines ' as he calls them ) . The ending will warm even the coldest heart . But my favourite bit is Jackie attempting to close the late Ned's mouth and causing his false teeth to fly out ! ' Father Ted ' was funny , but so is this , and its much nearer to reality . A real treat !
401241	7743887	77031	10.0	Where's Me Shirt ?	' The Incredible Hulk ' television series was the inspiration for a long-running joke in the U . K . It went as follows : " why does the Hulk always sound so angry ? You would too if your body grew to three times its normal size and yet your trousers stayed the same . " . Everyone from Ken Dodd to Eddie Large used it in their act at one time or other . I only mention it because it gives you an idea how popular this series was in the late ' 70's / early ' 80's . Loosely based on the Marvel comic book of the same name , ' T . I . H . ' told the story of Dr . David Banner ( Bill Bixby ) , a brilliant scientist who got an accidental overdose of gamma radiation during an experiment , and then when stressed out turned into the Hulk - a grotesque , powerful monster with skin the colour of vomit and a tendency towards mindless destruction . This being a family show , of course , he wasn't too violent , and dealt with the bad guys usually by picking them up and hurling them into rivers . He also got through a lot of shirts during the course of the series . Banner was thought to have perished when his lab blew up , but a nosey reporter by the name of ' McGee ' ( Jack Colvin ) was keen to get at the truth and so dogged him every step of the way , a sort of ' Lieutenant Gerard ' to Banner's ' Richard Kimble ' . Each week , Banner turned up in a different location , got a job ( altering his surname so that it still began with ' B ' ) , became involved with a local problem , which he then solved by ' Hulking out ' . Perhaps the show should have been retitled ' The Incredible Social Worker ' . The Hulk , as a rule , only made two appearances per episode , with Bixby's ' Banner ' carrying the show . The actor was familiar to viewers thanks to ' My Favourite Martian ' and ' The Magician ' . I always felt that he was an underrated performer who sadly never got the parts he deserved . I'm sure he could not have been too pleased when the script for the ' Hulk ' pilot landed on his doormat , but to his credit , he brought a quiet dignity to the role , much as Richard Basehart did with ' Admiral Nelson ' in ' Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea ' . Jack Colvin ( another underrated actor ) was equally excellent as ' McGee ' . One of the best episodes - ' Proof Positive ' - had McGee ( Banner did not appear that week ) explaining his motivations for hunting the creature . Muscle-man Lou Ferrigno proved the perfect embodiment of the Hulk . Much better than any C . G . I . rubbish . Critics in the U . K . reacted with disbelief when ' T . I . H . ' first appeared . Margaret Forwood of ' The Sun ' said that it was ' even sillier than the Man From Atlantis ' , while another likened the Hulk to the ' Jolly Green Giant ' . The public ignored the complaints and made the show a hit that ran for five years . I personally found it a refreshing change of pace after the high campery of superhero shows such as ' Batman ' and ' Wonder Woman ' . A trio of Hulk T . V . movies cropped up at the end of the ' 80's , but they were not much good . The first two featured ludicrous versions of two other Marvel characters - ' The Mighty Thor ' and ' Daredevil ' . More recently , we have had Ang Lee's ' Hulk ' ( 2003 ) and now a new one starring Edward Norton . But for me Dr . Banner will always be wearing flares and keeping an eye out for that guy from ' The National Register ' .
401526	7743887	74895	10.0	Meriel - Imaginary , Real Or Hallucinatory ?	1976 was a good year for anyone who loved well-crafted supernatural anthology shows . I . T . V . gave the world Nigel Kneale's ' Beasts ' , while B . B . C . - 2 had ' The Mind Beyond ' , a six-part series produced by Irene Shubik , the driving force behind the legendary science fiction series ' Out Of The Unknown ' . The first edition was ' Meriel , The Ghost Girl ' by David Halliwell . It begins when George Livingston ( the wonderful and much-missed Donald Pleasence ) , a psychical investigator , is asked to attend a séance in Cricklewood . One of the circle's number , a rich French woman , claims to have received visitations from the ghost of her late daughter Meriel , who was only seven when she died . To preserve their anonymity , the circle give themselves fake names such as ' Miss Brown and ' Mr . Green ' etc . Livingston insists on searching the room where the séance is to take place , then subjects the members of the circle to a body search . Satisfied , he allows the séance to proceed . The room goes dark and cold . The only sound to be heard is the deep breathing of the circle's members . Sensing a presence at his shoulder , Livingston reaches out and touches the naked body of a living , breathing child . Meriel has arrived . He asks her several questions , but the only one she replies to is " Do you love your mother ? " . She says yes . Meriel's mother bursts into tears . Suddenly , the ghost girl is gone . Unable to rationalise what he has seen , Livingston describes the incident in his book ' Annals Of A Psychical Investigator ' . Years later , he dies of bronchial pneumonia but the mystery of Meriel refuses to die with him . Others take up the case . The first of these is Sam Nicholls ( John Bluthal ) , a brash American with a fondness for trench coats and cigars . This poor man's Sam Spade begins to check on the authenticity of the book's details but on failing to find any concrete evidence concludes that Livingstone made the whole thing up in order to boost sales . Robina Oliver ( Janet Street-Porter . . . yes , THAT Janet Street-Porter ) is not so sure and , after searching Cricklewood , comes across a house identical to the one Livingstone described . The trail takes her to Miss Furniss ( Jane Hayden ) who claims to have been Meriel . She says she faked the apparition at the request of her parents who wanted to take the French woman for an expensive ride . Robina is sceptical . How can a fourteen year old girl realistically impersonate a seven year old ? Robina is genuinely convinced that Meriel existed . The last investigator , Dr . Delane ( Charles Keating ) , has an alternative view of the case . He thinks that she was nothing more than a mass hallucination . So what we have is a dramatised version of the ' Meriel ' incident , followed by three widely differing interpretations . Of these the Street-Porter one is the most interesting , mainly because its easy to believe Miss Furniss ' claims that the whole thing was faked . Remember that ' Sherlock Holmes ' creator Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle was fooled by some photos of ' fairies ' he once saw . Street-Porter cannot act to save her life , but thankfully she is only required to be herself . By contrast the Bluthal sequence borders on farce , with the actor behaving as though he has wandered straight off the set of Spike Milligan's ' Q ' series . The opening twenty or so minutes with Pleasence are excellent , and the séance scene registers on the ' creep-o-meter ' . When the other investigators take over it loses momentum slightly , but the theories put forward are nonetheless fascinating . The play ends with no real conclusion , the viewers are instead invited to make up their own minds . If it ever comes out on D . V . D . , I reasonably expect the scene in which Livingston encounters Meriel to be cut . This intriguing ghost story may not scare the pants off you , but it will certainly make you think .
400941	7743887	397806	10.0	The Welsh ' Passport To Pimlico ' ?	Over the years , there have been numerous attempts to put Wales and its people on the television screen , ranging from the cringe making Ronnie Barker sitcom ' The Magnificent Evans ' to the touching period drama ' We Are Seven ' . ' Mine All Mine ' was a piece of whimsy from the pen of Russell T . Davies , starring Griff Rhys Jones as the head of a dysfunctional Mumbles-based family who discovers he is the rightful owner of the land on which Swansea is built . Of course his new-found status as ' King of Swansea ' creates untold problems for both himself and his family . As one would expect from a Russell T . Davies series , the writing is first-rate . The cast are wonderful , particularly Jones as the dreamer ' Max Vivaldi ' and Rhian Morgan as his long-suffering wife Val . Even the minor characters , such as Debbie Chazen's ' Big Claire ' , are beautifully put over . For me , though , the real showstopper was Ruth Madoc as Val's trouble-making mother Myrtle . Being Welsh , I could recognise those characters from everyday life . Seeing familiar locations such as Mumbles pier and Swansea Town Hall was also a joy . The only annoying thing about this show was that it ended on a cliffhanger . Despite having many excellent qualities , ' Mine All Mine ' failed to find an audience . Perhaps its very Welshness alienated English audiences . I don't know . Russell was bitterly disappointed by the cancellation , he had plans for two more series . Four months later , however , he had a ratings blockbuster in the shape of ' Dr . Who ' . To think I . T . V . - 1 let this go after one series , yet pumped out five seasons of the execrable ' Footballers ' Wives ' - it beggars belief !
401654	7743887	60321	10.0	It's a gas !	This is my favourite ' Doctor ' film , made when ' 60's London was in full Swing . British comedy films were fast losing their appeal , with only the ' Carry On's ' carrying on , so for the ' Doctor ' series , it was a case of ' if you can't beat ' em , join ' em ' . Personally , I prefer the Philips ' Doctor ' films to the Bogarde ones . Here Leslie plays ' Dr . Gaston Grimsdyke ' ( different character to the one he played in ' Doctor In Love ' ) . Grimsdyke is after a job in America , but to qualify he has to be married , so he chases the lovely Jeannine ( Elisabeth Ercy ) . When she rejects him because of his age , he heads for Carnaby Street in pursuit of a new , youthful image . The bit where a reinvigorated Grimsdyke prances about in front of nurses in his trendy new clothes to the sound of John Scott's beat music is priceless ! Also of note are Arthur Haynes ( in his final role ) as the obdurate Mr . Wendover , and gorgeous Fenella Fielding as man-mad ballerina Tatiana Rubikoff . I must mention the sublime Joan Sims as Matron Joanna Sweet . The party scene where she goes under the laughing gas has me in fits each time ! ' Doctor In Clover ' is packed full of great comedy actors ( Terry Scott pops up as a camp hairdresser ) and moments you'll cherish forever and will want to see over and over again . As for the bit at the end , where the film suddenly goes into reverse , well , it is a comedy !
400973	7743887	679174	10.0	" I will not make any deals with you . I've resigned ! "	As I write this , a remake of the television classic ' The Prisoner ' is nearing completion . Those of us who remember the original view the prospect with some trepidation . How many great movies / T . V . series have had their reputations sullied by remakes ? Too many to name . Even the B . B . C . have gotten in on the act with ' Survivors ' , loosely based on Terry Nation's classic show . With ' The Prisoner ' , its more worrying because the opportunities for failure are greater . Have they chosen the right man to replace Patrick McGoohan ? Will the new location work out ? Will the plots be dumbed down ? Ah well , questions are a burden to others as someone once said , so let us wait and see . The first episode of the original was aptly titled ' Arrival ' , and it was written by George Markstein and David Tomblin . An unnamed British secret agent resigns , and is swiftly abducted by unknown forces . He wakes up in a strange place known only as ' The Village ' . Here other ex-agents have been incarcerated and are forced to live out their lives though with numbers in place of their names . Our hero finds himself lumbered with the number Six . Attempts to escape from The Village usually end in failure . strange balloon-like creatures called ' Rovers ' emerge from the sea , roaring like demented lions , to pursue and in some cases suffocate would-be runaways . Number Six is told by the Chairman of The Village - Number Two - that he has only a short time to willingly co-operate , such as stating his reason for resigning , and that if he fails to do so , the information will be forcibly extracted from his mind . The local hospital is a front for a brainwashing centre . Number Six witnesses first-hand the horror of seeing people reduced to gibbering imbeciles . The first part of ' Arrival ' is devoted to setting up the premise of the show . The beautiful Portmeirion location contrasts magnificently with the cold and clinical interiors . Patrick McGoohan is , as you would expect , simply brilliant . His performance encompasses anger , confusion , wry amusement , and defiance . ' Number Two ' is initially played by the late Guy Doleman ( ' Colonel Ross ' in Michael Caine's ' Harry Palmer ' films ) but half-way through the episode another actor - George Baker - assumes the role . Doleman's ' Number Two ' is charming and polite , but Baker's is an altogether more unpleasant character . On a sad note , Virginia Maskell , who plays ' The Woman ' , committed suicide a short time after this was broadcast . The second part deals with an attempt by Number Six to escape from The Village in a helicopter . Having managed to obtain an electro-pass from a woman who was emotionally attached to an old colleague called ' Cobb ' ( Paul Eddington ) , Number Six flies off , but as this is only the first episode it is reasonable to assume he does not get far . ' Arrival ' presents us with a world where nothing is what it seems and where no-one can be trusted . Even the maps on sale in The Village shop do not tell the truth . On arriving in The Village , Number Six repeatedly bumps into the same man ( Oliver MacGreevy ) in different guises . No matter what Number Six does or where he goes , he always seems to find himself right back where he started . I expect the new version to simplify the original's complexities , meaning it will probably not gain a cult following nor be the subject of discussion in thirty years ' time . Superbly written , acted , edited , and directed , ' Arrival ' is one of the greatest openings to a television series ever . If you only decide to watch one episode of ' The Prisoner ' , make it this one . Be Seeing You !
400843	7743887	679179	10.0	The Politics Of Individuality	Of the seventeen episodes which form Patrick McGoohan's brilliant ' The Prisoner ' series , ' Free For All ' is in my view the most relevant to the modern world . Written and directed by the man himself ( sheltering behind the pseudonym ' Paddy Fitz ' ) , it was the fourth to be broadcast in the U . K . , and the first to baffle viewers by stepping outside the spy story framework . It begins with an unusually benign Number 2 visiting 6 at home , and over breakfast informing him that there is to be an election in The Village , the winner becoming the new Number 2 . 6 is sceptical , but the thought of meeting Number 1 is tempting . Invited to address The Village , 6 airs his thoughts ( " I am not a number . . . I am a person ! " ) . The crowd laughs . No sooner has 6 finished speaking than placards bearing his face are carried through the confetti-strewn streets , drums are banged , striped umbrellas twirled , and the crowd cheer him on to victory . For the duration of the campaign , 6 is given the services of a maid - Number 58 - who speaks no English . 6 is invited to address the outgoing Council . In a stylish underground chamber , he confronts a row of brainwashed imbeciles . 6's motives for running for office are questioned . When he does not respond , he is handed over to the manager of the Labour Exchange . A different 6 emerges , spouting meaningless slogans and making impossible-to-keep promises . He has become the people's choice . Needless to say , he does not remain in this state for long , and attempts to flee The Village in a motorboat . Rover brings him back , and the brainwashing resumes . Only two candidates are running for office - the handsome yet mindless ( thanks to The Village ) 6 , and the older , experienced 2 . Everyone loves 6 , hardly anyone seems to back 2 . Yet their ' views ' seem to be much the same . Which is very much the case in modern politics . The public , when faced with the daunting prospect of exercising their democratic right , will often vote for the guy who used to read the news on television or who once acted in a long-running soap . Policies ? Forget it . To cut the story short , 6 wins by a landslide . As the transfer of power takes place , the Villagers ' enthusiasm for 6 appears to have evaporated totally . He enters The Green Dome with Number 58 at his side . After initially behaving like a couple of kids let loose in a sweet-shop , their personalities change - he is his old rebellious self once again , she turns nasty and starts slapping him across the face . 6 uses his new position to order a mass evacuation of The Village , but no-one listens . Number 1 is still in command . Cue one very violent ending ( one that had to be trimmed for the original U . K . broadcast ) . ' Free For All ' is a marvellous political allegory . 6 wishes to win power for the right reasons ( to free the people ) , but is reprogrammed by the establishment so that his ideals virtually disappear . The odds are stacked against him from the start . To remind viewers this is an adventure show , there is a motorboat chase , of course , but that's the only concession McGoohan makes . The brainwashing scene is chilling , the late George Benson ( best known for comedy roles ) making a superb interrogator . Even his offer of tea is not to be trusted ! Rachel Herbert's character is used initially for comic relief , rather like Rosalie Crutchley's in ' Checkmate ' , but at the climax , her true significance is revealed , and 6 finds he has been been played for a patsy once more . There is no democracy in The Village ; it is all an illusion . The scene with the ' Tally Ho ' reporters is hilarious , as is the one in the underground therapy zone where Villagers can drink real alcohol without disturbing the equilibrium of The Village . This was one of Eric Portman's last roles , and he is splendid as the ' under dog ' candidate - the older man who knows he will be soundly beaten at the ballet box yet still has to go through the motions of the democratic process . When ' The Prisoner ' was reviewed on the B . B . C . ' s ' Did You See ? ' back in 1983 , Julian Critchley ( the late Tory M . P . for Aldershot ) dismissed ' Free For All ' as ' high camp . . . James Bond without the music ' . Was that his real view ? Or did he sense the episode's message and thought to try and discredit it ?
401257	7743887	679188	10.0	Number Six Times Two	Patrick McGoohan , my favourite actor , died earlier this week ( shame on B . B . C . - 1's ' Six O'Clock News ' and I . T . N . for failing to mention this . If it had been Russell Brand it probably would have been the lead item ) , so I thought I'd pay small tribute by looking at an episode of his most famous creation - ' The Prisoner ' T . V . series . I won't spell out the plot in great detail because it would be unfair to anyone viewing it for the first time . Also , it is hard to do ! It begins in Number Six's cottage , where he is assisting a young woman called Alison ( Jane Merrow ) who has telepathic abilities . As he picks out Xener cards , she is able to correctly identify each one . She puts it down to a psychic bond between them . A accident with a soda syphon leaves him with a bruised thumbnail . We do not know it yet but that bruise - and her photograph of it - will be important later on . As she leaves , the scene switches to The Village's control room , where Number Two ( Anton Rodgers ) commences the latest plot to break The Prisoner and learn the reason for his resignation . A light over the sleeping Prisoner's head pulsates , and medics carry him off to the hospital . He is there for an undetermined period , long enough for him to grown a moustache anyway , also his hair is dyed black , and he undergoes electric shock treatment to make him left-handed instead of right . When he awakens , he is not in his usual dwelling , and when he looks in a mirror sees his appearance has been altered . At the Green Dome , Number Two addresses him as ' Number Twelve ' , and acts as though he is on his side . Number Six is given his ' orders ' - to break himself ! After having his hair dyed back to its original colour and the moustache shaved , Number Six returns to his original dwelling . Who should be in residence but . . . Number Six ? Confused ? So apparently was director Pat Jackson when he read the script back in 1966 . To his credit , his confusion is not apparent . The complex plan to make The Prisoner doubt his identity almost works . Following a lengthy session with the double in which both men sword fence , shoot guns , and box , ironically it is Alison who provides the final damning proof by establishing her psychic bond with the double . It is all a put-up job though , and later she regrets her decision to co-operate with The Village . ' Schizoid Man ' is one of the finest episodes of the series , intriguing throughout , boasting a tour-de-force performance from McGoohan . When the double lays in wait for Number Six with a nerve gas gun , the actor excludes the charming arrogance he would bring later to his many villainous roles , such as ' Roger Devereau ' in ' Silver Streak ' . The scene where Number Six makes himself right-handed again is powerful indeed . Anton Rodgers is the youngest ' Number Two ' seen in the show so far , playing him not as a ruthless interrogator but a seemingly-harmless bureaucrat : " Here I am , stuck in Admin ! " . However , when Number Six fails the mind-reading test with Alison , you will see Number Two smirking at The Prisoner's discomfiture . Not so nice after all . Terence Feely's script so impressed McGoohan the writer was invited to join the board of directors at Everyman Films - the company that made the series . It is a superbly plotted show , with a strong ending , even if Number Six's carelessness is ultimately a little hard to swallow , given that earlier episodes established him as a tricky character to outwit . The new ' Prisoner ' has got an awful lot to live up to . If only one episode is half as good as this , I will be happy . But no matter how superior the new show's special effects might or might not be , you cannot replace McGoohan . He was ' The Prisoner ' . Be Seeing You , Patrick .
401454	7743887	302182	10.0	They Were More Than Just The Welsh Morecambe & Wise	In the early ' 70's , it looked as though Welsh comedians Ryan Davies and Ronnie Williams were poised to breakthrough into the British comedy mainstream . Bill Cotton , the then-Head Of Light Entertainment at the B . B . C . attended a recording of one of their shows and , despite not really understanding it ( it was in Welsh ) was sufficiently impressed by the audience's reaction to the duo put them on B . B . C . - 1 . ' Ryan & Ronnie ' was a lively , amusing show , combining sketches in which they took off top television shows of the day such as ' Steptoe & Son ' , ' Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In ' , even ' The Magic Roundabout ' , musical items , Eric & Ernie-style cross-talk , and the soap opera parody ' Our House ' which was good enough to have warranted a spin-off . It would have been unsurprising if they had failed to appeal to audiences beyond the valleys , but they didn't and ' Ryan & Ronnie ' ran for three seasons . Sadly , their triumph was to be short-lived ; Ryan died of asthma in 1977 , robbing us of a wonderful double-act whose potential went largely unrealised .
400726	7743887	478942	10.0	" Take A Look At The Lawman . . . "	When I first heard about this , I thought : " Here we go again . Yet another one of those awful ' let's make fun of the past ' shows . " ( in fact , it was originally going to be that way , and called ' Ford Granada ' . But then commonsense prevailed ) . I tuned in nervously to the first episode . It came as a pleasant surprise . That it got made at all is another reason to be thankful to ' Dr . Who ' executive producer Julie Gardner . It had been turned down beforehand by both the B . B . C . and Channel 4 . The premise is this : D . C . I . Sam Tyler is involved in a hit-and-run incident and finds himself in 1973 , working alongside the ebullient D . C . I . Gene Hunt and sexy W . P . C . Annie Cartwright . He does his best to adjust to his new environment , but there are constant reminders of his old life ; the girl on the B . B . C . test card sends him cryptic messages , he hears medics trying to revive him , and meets himself as a boy . The production team has gone to a good deal of trouble to evoke the era ; at times ' Life On Mars ' comes close to mirroring ' Special Branch ' and ' The Sweeney ' , the character of D . C . I . Hunt puts one in mind of John Thaw's ' Regan ' . As soon as he appears , seizing Tyler's lapels , and spitting : " Its 1973 . Almost dinnertime , and I'm having hoops ! " , you know the show is going to work . Its a terrific performance from Philip Glenister . John Simm is equally outstanding as the reluctant time traveller . Inaccuraccies crop up here and there ; ' male bonding ' was not a phrase in common use in the ' 70's , and ' Nelson ' the Rastafarian barman isn't credible for that era , but to complain would be churlish . ' Life On Mars ' is my favourite programme of 2006 and I cannot wait for the second ( alas , the last ) series . Already , talk of a spin-off is rife ; instead of ' Ashes To Ashes ' , perhaps they should call it ' Gene Genie ' ?
401188	7743887	538479	10.0	" Talk , Stirling , talk !

Stirling is being broken a bit at a time . The water is drugged , and the exit turns out to be fake . The only people who can help him are Richard and Sharon , but they dare not lift a finger for fear of revealing the existence of their super powers . . . One of the best episodes of ' Man In A Suitcase ' was ' Brainwash ' . ' The Interrogation ' has virtually the same plot , and yes Colin Blakely played an interrogator in that too . Good use of clips of old episodes , Its easily Stuart Damon's finest work on the show , and Blakely gives him powerful support . Dennis Spooner's script has a strong ' Prisoner ' feel . Its the ending which makes the story , though . No , I'm not giving it away . You'll have to watch for yourself .
401030	7743887	698885	10.0	Terror From Thames !	Sufferers of a nervous disposition found much in early ' 70's British television to give them sleepless nights - the half-eaten corpse in the ' Tomorrow The Rat ' episode of ' Doomwatch ' ; ' Dr . Edith Joynton ' ageing to death in seconds in ' Timeslip ' ; ' Platoon Under-Leader ' Benton's transformation into a Primord in the ' Dr . Who ' story ' Inferno ' ; people turning into skeletons in the ' Bones Of Byrom Blain ' outing of ' Department S ' , and in ' The Goodies ' , Tim Brooke-Taylor in drag finding the remains of Cecily's nanny in a rocking chair ( more frightening than ' Psycho ' ! ) . I forgot to mention Hughie Green in ' Opportunity Knocks ! ' . Beating them all for sheer terror was the title sequence of this Thames-made anthology series . Following the familiar Thames logo , we see a bleak overhead shot of a town . We then glide along a row of terraced houses , whose windows contain screaming faces , a faceless figure , and a boy staring at a bald man whose internal organs are on display . Accompanying all this is a haunting Roger Webb tune , punctuated by the chatter of human voices . Brown trousers time . ' The Death Watcher ' , the third edition broadcast , was written by Jacques Gilles , whose other credits include an episode of ' Danger Man ' ( called ' Say It With Flowers ' ) starring the late , great Patrick McGoohan . Emmy Erikson ( Judy Parfitt ) is a University Professor who travels by train to meet Pickering ( John Neville ) in the name of research for a book on psychic phenomena . He surprises her by taking her to a different location , a house in an isolated setting . He appears charming and affable at first , then mentions his reason for bringing her there . He wishes to stage an experiment to communicate with the dead . Realising he is a nut case , she tries to leave , but there are no late trains so she reluctantly must stay the night . The room she is given has bars on the windows and the door is locked . The next morning , she again tries to leave , but Pickering instructs his employee Dawson ( Victor Maddern ) to physically restrain her . In his cellar , the deranged Pickering has a box in which he intends to imprison Emmy , cover it with chicken wire , and fill with water . As she dies , the last thing she will see is a huge blow-up photograph of her killer . He can then ( so he believes ) speak to her in the next world . Emmy tries screaming out of her window , but to no avail . Pickering has put up a sign that says : ' Nursing Home ' . Passers-by simply ignore her cries of help . . . This is a tense , suspenseful story , and John Neville ( who played ' Sherlock Holmes ' in the 1965 film ' A Study In Terror ' as well as the title role in Terry Gilliam's ' Baron Munchausen ' ) is brilliant as the maniac . Charming , elegant , intelligent - but mad , not averse to dancing with a roll of chicken wire ! Judy Parfitt likewise is impressive as the imprisoned Professor . Today they would probably cast some bimbo in the role . Victor Maddern , known for comedy roles , provides good support as ' Dawson ' . Ostensibly he is on Pickering's side , but then even he comes to see his employer is off his trolley . The ending is guaranteed to send a shiver up the spine . Eleven episodes of this show were made , still exist , and deserve to be released on D . V . D . Checking the transmission dates , I note that the last one went out two years after the rest of the series . I wonder why ?
401639	7743887	111958	10.0	" More tea , Father ? "	To my eternal shame , I shunned ' Father Ted ' when it was originally broadcast , and only got into it in 2000 when it was shown on The Paramount Comedy Channel . Its impossible to deliver an objective review of this show because everything about it is perfect . The late Dermot Morgan was one of the greatest comedians of all time ; his early death robbed us of a great talent . It would have been interesting to see what he would have done next . The scripts by Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan are masterpieces of surreal comedy . Frank Kelly as ' Father Jack Hackett ' , Pauline MacLynn as ' Mrs . Doyle ' and , Ardal O'Hanlon as ' Father Dougal MacGuire ' . . . well , what can I say ? Marvellous . I'm not a great fan of Graham Norton , but his appearances in ' Father Ted ' redeem a lot of the dross reality stuff he's done since . My favourite episode has to be ' A Song For Europe ' mainly due to the hysterically funny ' My Lovely Horse ' song ! Dermot may be gone , but he's left behind a classic that will last forever .
400825	7743887	80917	10.0	An Everyday Story Of A Monk Falling In Love With A Hooker !	' In God We Tru$t ' opened to a unanimous drubbing from critics and public alike . Universal terminated Marty's contract , plunging him into suicidal despair . Actually , its quite a clever satire on the commercialisation of religion , Christianity in particular . Many attacked the film on the basis that it was somehow blasphemous , which is ridiculous . Marty Feldman gives a delightful performance as ' Brother Ambrose ' , a monk who ventures into the outside world to seek financial help for his monastery , and is appalled at what he finds . Peter Boyle's mobile church has to be seen to be believed ! Andy Kaufman almost steals the film as ' Armaggeddon T . Thunderbird ' , a charlatan of the first order , and Louise Lasser is terrific as the hooker who captures Brother Ambrose's heart . The film combines satire with slapstick to hilarious effect , and the scene with Richard Pryor as G . O . D . is classic ! Despite putting paid to Marty's popularity in the U . S . A . , this underrated comedy deserves a major revaluation .
400831	7743887	77147	10.0	Eric Idle's Finest Hour	" The final impression conveyed by this dismal programme was that of the talentless sneering at the talented " was how one angry Beatles fan summed up ' All You Need Is Cash ' in a letter to ' The Radio Times ' in 1978 . He'd missed the point completely . Eric Idle and Gary Weis ' film is not a mickey take of the group themselves , but rather the media circus that surrounded the Beatles . Archive footage is seamlessly blended with new material to create an exhilarating comic portrait of a fictitious ' 60's super group . Those who saw Tony Palmer's pretentious ' All You Need Is Love ' series will appreciate Idle's spoof even more . Special mention must be made of Neil Innes as the Lennon figure , Ron Nasty . So brilliant were his Beatles pastiches that they were eventually released as an album . And as for ' Yellow Submarine Sandwich ' , well , it takes your breath away ! Not all of the film works , for example , the joke made of Brian Epstein's death falls flat , but it remains Idle's best post ' Python ' project to date .

They start by changing the name to the more soporific-sounding ' Snooze ' . Graeme goes further , creating a new formula which knocks out anyone who takes so much as a sip . Half the country is put to sleep , and Bill starts sleepwalking through minefields . . . The first ' Goodies ' episode to really hit the mark , ' Snooze ' is great fun , not in the least because of Roddy Maude-Roxby's turn as the hyperactive ' Rupert ' : " O . K . ? O . K . ? Fine ! Fine ! " . The actor had previously appeared in the U . S . series ' Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In ' , and was the dimwitted ' Professor Weaver ' in Michael Palin and Terry Jones ' ' The Complete & Utter History Of Britain ' . Funniest moment - the wordless opening in which Graeme rises , has breakfast and gets dressed . Definitely a major influence on Nick Park !

As it drifts over London , it turns the city into a lush tropical paradise . . . Ahead of its time or what ? The sight of the entire British population in gas-masks , dead birds falling from the skies and glowing radioactive cattle might have amused in 1971 , but makes disturbing viewing now . Nevertheless , the episode's got more than its fair share of laughs . The late Ronnie Stevens was a familiar face in British comedy films of the ' 50's and ' 60's . Some excellent visual effects as London becomes a jungle , inhabited by people who resemble walking Christmas trees . Funniest moment - Tim putting his hand out of the window to see if it is raining , and when he pulls it back it is covered in black sludge ! Second funniest moment - a sign on the Ministry Of Pollution that reads : Conservationists Get Lost !
401472	7743887	706471	10.0	" Of all the coppers in London , why pick on me ? "	On the B . B . C . ' s ' I Love The ' 70's ' , it was incorrectly stated that ' The Sweeney ' was the first violent British crime television series . Season Three of ' Special Branch ' beat it to the airwaves by two years . The earlier seasons , shot on videotape with film inserts , starred Derren Nesbitt as ' D . C . I . Jordan ' . After a gap of three years , it returned , completely reformatted and recast . Craggy George Sewell took up the main role of ' D . C . I . Alan Craven ' , a tough man in a tough world . The new-look show was the first to be made by Euston Films , an offshoot of Thames T . V . Over the next two decades , the company made some of the most successful British television shows ever - ' Minder ' , ' Danger U . X . B . ' , ' Widows ' , ' Quatermass ' , ' Reilly Ace Of Spies ' , ' The Flame Trees Of Thika ' and , of course , ' The Sweeney ' . ' A Copper Called Craven ' , written by Roger Marshall , begins with a small-time crook called Ridley ( Tony Selby ) being arrested while trying to smuggle gold watches through customs at Heathrow airport . In his defence he claims that he had bribed D . C . I . Craven to let him through . Craven is suspended from active duty in the Special Branch . His home is searched by detectives , and he is subjected to harsh interrogation at the hands of Pettiford ( Peter Jeffrey ) . To make matters worse , a large sum of money has been deposited in his bank account , so clearly someone is trying to frame him . But whom ? Craven embarks on a one-man quest to clear his name . . . You immediately know you are not watching ' Dixon Of Dock Green ' thanks to the opening titles which feature shots of London tourist landmarks inter-cut with Craven loading and firing his gun , looking at mug-shots , and watching a fan-dancer in a Soho club . As cinemas were full of films such as ' Get Carter ' , ' Sitting Target ' , and ' Villain ' , it was inevitable that television would be influenced in some way . Of course ' Special Branch ' had some way to go , the early Season Three episodes feature little by way of action , but that would change over time . Patrick Mower was brought in to play ' D . C . I . Tom Haggerty ' , a younger , brasher detective ( an ex-Flying Squad man ) often at loggerheads with Craven . Sewell is marvellous , wonderfully conveying the anger and frustration of the framed detective . Nobody likes a bent copper , least of all the police themselves . Much of Craven's background is sketched in , such as him having had a poor upbringing , which Pettiford tries to use to his advantage by making it seem like justification for corruption . Sewell is hardly Robert Redford , and this works in the show's favour by giving it an extra dimension of reality . Watching him in this it is hard to believe that only three years before he had been chasing green-skinned aliens in the sci-fi drama ' U . F . O . ' ! Peter Jeffrey likewise turns in a powerful performance as Pettiford . The actor had played villains in shows such as ' The Avengers ' and also acted in Lindsay Anderson's ' If ? ' . The scenes where he interrogates Craven are superbly written and acted , boasting a smattering of expletives that were rare for the day . Craven has a black girlfriend - Nurse Pam Sloane ( Sheila Scott-Wilkinson ) - a fact predictably used against him by his accusers . A very good piece of crime drama then , and a strong season opener . A pity the show became overshadowed by ' The Sweeney ' because it is comparable in terms of quality . And I think it has a much better theme tune !
400878	7743887	71060	10.0	" Oh , Eric ! "	In the early ' 70's , the B . B . C . revived several hit sitcoms from the previous decade , including ' Steptoe & Son ' , ' The Likely Lads ' , ' Till Death Us Do Part ' , ' Whacko ! ' , and of course , ' Sykes ' . I . T . V . had been enjoying success with the likes of ' On The Buses ' , the ' Doctor ' series , and ' Please Sir ! ' and the B . B . C . wanted to compete . In the new medium of colour , the resurrected shows took on a new lease of life . Each week , the pounding of a drum would signal the start of a new ' Sykes ' episode . The new show was much the same as the earlier one ; he still lived in Sebastopol Terrace ( though at number 28 , not 24 ) with twin sister Hattie ( Hattie Jacques ) , and the next-door neighbour was the pompous Charles Fulbright Brown ( Richard Wattis ) . Added to the mix were Deryck Guyler ( fresh from ' Please Sir ! ' ) as a policeman with a fondness for food named ' P . C . Turnbull ' ( known to his friends as ' Korky ' ) , and Eric had an admirer in the shape of Madge from the bread shop ( Joan Sims ) who called him ' Ricky ' and kept him supplied with cakes . Korky's wife was never seen , but her reedy voice ( courtesy of Eric ) sounded not unlike that of ' Minnie Bannister ' from ' The Goon Show ' . Eric's character was that of an overgrown boy , constantly trying out new things ( such as building his own burglar alarm or redecorating ) but never quite getting the hang of them . Hat ( or ' Harriet ' as he often called her ) was like a mother figure , always telling him off but defending him when others did the same . She frequently talked to the cuckoo clock on the wall , which she called ' Peter ' . In one episode , Eric and Hattie returned from holiday only to find an old tramp ( Roy Dotrice ) had moved in and made himself at home ( Eric had left the front door open ! ) . In another , they went to a holiday camp where Eric caused chaos by refusing to get up early in the morning . Another memorable episode had him getting a job in a factory , and almost causing a strike by working too slow and then too fast ! When Eric , Hattie and Korky went caravanning , they fell out and hurled plates of porridge at one another ! Another time they bought a boat and almost got blown up by a mine left over from W . W . 2 . " Its alright ! " , said Hat : " I think its one of ours ! " . Some of the early episodes were remakes of the ' 60's shows , such as ' Sykes & A Stranger ' . The original featured Leo McKern as an ex-con who returns to honour a old childhood promise to marry Hattie . For the remake , Eric enlisted the services of his old friend from ' The Goon Show ' days Peter Sellers ( in a rare B . B . C . sitcom appearance ) . ' Sykes ' blend of visual and character driven comedy made it a big hit which ran for the remainder of the decade . Wattis sadly passed on in 1975 , and the show continued but was noticeably poorer for his absence . Joy Harington came aboard as another neighbour - Miss Rumbelow . It ended in 1979 with the appalling ' The B . B . C . Honours Sykes ' . I say appalling because it ruined the illusion that the show was not a sitcom ! In 1980 , Hattie died . The B . B . C . wanted Eric to continue alone , but he rightly declined . The chemistry between the leads had made ' Sykes ' special . Repeats have been few and far between . Network issued the 1972 series on D . V . D . in 2004 , but its ongoing dispute with the B . B . C . means we are unlikely to get more releases , and ' 2entertain ' do not seem keen to pick up the baton . A few years back , the now-defunct satellite channel ' U . K . Drama Daytime ' put on most - but not all - of the shows . They showed that ' Sykes ' still has the ability to delight and amuse in equal proportions .
400960	7743887	363653	10.0	Grand Slam is Epic !	Rather like the ' Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads ? ' episode ' No Hiding Place ' , the B . B . C . Wales comedy film ' Grand Slam ' is revived whenever there's a major sporting event , only here its rugby . You would think it would be easy to tire of , but no , each viewing is an absolute joy . It traces the exploits of a group of Welshmen as they travel to Paris for the final game in the season . And what a motley lot they are ; ' Caradog ' the undertaker , seeking a girl he loved in the war whom he knows only as ' butterfly ' , ' Mog ' , who will hit any Frenchman who dares besmirch the name of Phil Bennett ; ' Glyn ' the ' Viva Zapata ' mustachioed ladies ' man ; camp-as-a-row-of-tents boutique owner ' Maldwyn ' , and ' Will Posh ' , who hates foreign beer so much he takes along his own . Caradog finds that the bistro in which he met his butterfly woman is now a strip-club , while she has degenerated into a seedy alcoholic . His son Glyn scores with her sexy daughter Odette ( Sharon Morgan ) , who shields him from the police when they raid the place . The humour is natural , coming out of the characters themselves . The depiction of the Welsh is certainly more believable than that of say , ' The Magnificent Evans ' , which could have been set on another planet . Great performances throughout , including google-eyed Hugh Griffith as ' Caradog ' , Sion Probert as ' Maldwyn ' ( don't think they could get away with such a character now ! ) , and , of course , Windsor Davies as ' Mog ' ( next to ' It Ain't ' Alf Hot , Mum ' , this is his finest performance ) . Comic highlights include Mog's horror on realising he has to share a bed with the gay Maldwyn , the latter's attempts to explain what a bidet is for , Mog's striptease , and his walking through the Parisian streets in his underwear to get to the game . The only thing wrong with the production is that a sequel never got made . These strong characters deserved a second or even third outing . In response to the user who said you need to be Welsh in order to enjoy the film , I say no more than you need to be Irish to appreciate ' Father Ted ' . Sixty minutes of inspired comedy . And the Gren cartoons are great too ! ADDENDA : On the very day I wrote this review , Wales won the Grand Slam !
401014	7743887	145614	10.0	Journey To Michael's Mad World !	Bowler hatted men march over Westminster Bridge . Lining up firing squad fashion , they aim their umbrellas at the Union flag and shoot . It could be the opening to an ' Avengers ' caper , instead it was the prelude to one of the zaniest comedies the B . B . C . has ever made - ' Its A Square World ' . I have only seen one episode of this fondly remembered ' 60's show ( repeated in 1976 as part of a B . B . C . retrospective ) but enjoyed it enormously . The late Michael Bentine not only starred ( his ' lecture ' sketches predated those of Ronnie Barker on ' The Two Ronnies ) , but co-wrote it with John Law . As you'd expect from one of the founders of ' The Goon Show ' , the show was rich in inspired lunacy , employing animation , puppets and Visual Effects , in sketches such as ' What Goes On In A Singer's Mind ' ( little animated men running around inside a man's head ) , a B . B . C . reporter interviewing a sexy French film-star loses his composure and tries to kiss her , a Chinese junk sails up the Thames and fires at The Houses Of Parliament , the source of the Thames turns out to be a giant dripping tap , a spy disclosing stolen rocket secrets over a public phone is astonished when the box takes off like a rocket , the B . B . C . T . V . centre is attacked by cowboys and Indians and , in a later episode , is shot into space . Many believe this to have been a major influence on later flights of fancy such as ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' and ' The Goodies ' . Anything could happen in ' Its A Square World ' and usually did . The supporting cast included ( though not all at the same time ) Clive Dunn , Ronnie Barker , Deryck Guyler , Frank Thornton and Dick Emery . Bentine later took the show to A . T . V . - resulting in the less successful ' All Square ' . After a spell on children's television , in 1977 , he tried to revive the show . A pilot entitled ' Michael Bentine's Square World ' was screened , but led to no series . Which was a pity , seeing how it was directed by the brilliant Jim Franklin . Two sketches stick out ; office workers doing acrobatics in the workplace , leaping over desks and so on and a superb World War Two sketch about witches and warlocks forming their own air force . The sight of women in pointed hats on broomsticks taking off from an airfield ' 633 Squadron'-style had to be seen to be believed ! With more and more archive television appearing on D . V . D . , given the talent involved in its making and its importance in the development of British comedy , is it too much to ask that ' Its A Square World ' be considered for release in the not-too distant future ?
400955	7743887	563095	10.0	" Dog ! "	The students attend a lecture by the eccentric Dr . Towers ( Peter Bayliss ) , an expert on hypnosis . When he requests a volunteer , Duncan steps forward . After making a fool of the doctor , he is then hypnotised for real by Mike . Duncan wakes up normal except for one thing - whenever anyone uses the word ' dog ' in his presence , he barks ! Mike tries to reverse the condition , but Duncan does not respond and goes off , wandering about St . Swithins in a hypnotic trance . His friends must find him before he does serious damage to himself . . . Robin Nedwell gets here to do some of the visual clowning he later brought to ' In Charge ' and its sequels . He is particularly good when sending up Towers . Later in 1970 , the first season of ' The Goodies ' ( scripted by Garden & Oddie ) also featured a character ( in this case , Bill Oddie's ) wandering about in a daze while his friends endeavour to rescue him . The reason though is different ; instead of hypnosis , Bill has drunk some of Grahame's cocoa ! The late Peter Bayliss is ' Dr . Towers ' . He is best remembered as Dennis Dunstable's drunken Dad in ' Please Sir ! ' and ' The Fenn Street Gang ' ( he was apparently an eccentric in real life . His answering machine contained the following message for callers : " Hello , this is Peter Bayliss ' budgie speaking . He's not at home at the moment as he's gone out to buy me some bird seed ! " . ) Funniest Moment - Dr . Towers about to stick a hypodermic needle into Duncan's arm , only to stick it in his own by mistake !
401681	7743887	576228	10.0	The Nightmare Sunday	The third episode of the first series of ' Fall & Rise ' begins with Reggie at Sunshine Desserts . The model for a new ice cream pagoda has been left on his desk . Unsurprisingly , he hates it . The broken window in his office still needs fixing . A call to the 24 hour maintenance man establishes that he has gone home . When Elisabeth goes to visit her mother on Sunday , Reggie asks Joan to pop round , on the pretext that ' something has come up ' . Once they are alone , he gives her a quick kiss , before apologising profusely . To his amazement , his affectionate gesture is reciprocated . Joan has waited for eight years for him to make the first move . She meekly leads Reggie upstairs to the spare room ( in a lovely touch , he reverses the picture of the Queen so that it faces the wall ) . But before they can get down to it , Reggie has the first of several visitors . . . There is something farce like about this episode . Pretty woman in a bedroom , and her would-be lover frantically trying to keep her presence secret . It is still good fun though , with Rossiter's mounting terror at the thought of being caught with Joan hilarious ( listen to how quickly the actor speaks . It is like a machine-gun in full flow , yet every word can be perfectly understood . I know of no other actor - past and present - capable of doing this ) . First visitor is Mark , Reggie's out-of-work actor son ( David Warwick ) . Mark would only appear in one other episode - ' The Memorial Service ' - before being killed off completely . With his long hair , left-wing sloganeering T-shirts , and fondness for Cockney rhyming slang , the character is neither particularly interesting nor amusing . He is also a bit of scrounger , always taking money off his parents . Perhaps David Nobbs decided he was a little too similar to Jimmy . Speaking of whom , he is here too , and yes , there's been a ' cock-up on the catering front ' . Tom is the last to arrive , smoking what Reggie describes as ' one of those revolting brier pipes ' , and uses for the first time what became his catchphrase : " I am not a something-or-other person ! " . Funniest moment - Reggie nervously awaiting Joan's arrival . Then he notices he has B . O . and goes upstairs to wash . The next time we see him , he is wearing a clean shirt . Sniffing his armpit , he exclaims : " Its getting worse ! " and goes off again .
401120	7743887	563082	10.0	" There's something fishy going on here ! "	Loftus ' quest for a knighthood continues . . . After showing a Harley Street consultant named Sir Desmond around the Research Unit , Loftus notices he has left behind his little black bag , so tells Duncan to return it . Duncan's car , with the bag inside , is taken by Paul , wishing to impress his beautiful date . Duncan thinks it has been stolen and informs the police . Finding it outside a classy restaurant , Duncan takes it back . Paul too informs the police . Patrolmen arrest Duncan and take him to the station , believing him to be a thief . He tells the Sergeant who he is . But Paul is there also , and is also calling himself ' Dr . Duncan Waring ' . . . George Layton had written a number of episodes for ' At Large ' under the alias ' Oliver Fry ' , but by the time of ' In Charge ' felt confidant enough to use his real name . Just as well because this is a cracking episode , with lots of farcical twists and turns , and a hilarious performance from Benny Hill regular Bob Todd as the befuddled Police Sergeant . Jonathan Lynn , who played ' Danny Hooley ' in Series 2 of ' In The House ' co-authored the script . Good continuity - Dr . Aziz from ' The Black & White Medical Show ' is mentioned briefly . Apparently his last act before leaving the hospital was to help Paul with his wine making ! Funniest moment - Loftus arriving at the Police Station , and announcing himself . With three doctors currently in his cells , the Sergeant looks aghast at the arrival of yet another !
