563953	102816	295178	1.0	My God , it's just . . . AWFUL ! ! !	I've never liked the Austin Powers movies ( or Mike Myers for that matter ) as they have always come across as being the product of an over-indulgent , but not very bright , imagination . They'll all so flimsy and crudely stapled together that it baffles me why people adore them and spend $200 million + at the box office . Are we so braindead and slovenly that utter , utter garbage like this is what passes for our collective sense of humor ? As previously , the film is just random scenes of nonsense connected in the most superficial of ways with a moronic ' plot ' . And don't give me ' but that's the point ' , because I don't think that excuses it for having absolutely no class or sophistication whatsoever . Everything , from the camp static sets to the pathetic widescreen photography reeks of Wal-Mart movie making . It's all so amateur . I actually walked out of the 2nd Austin Powers film ( and I really should have just switched this one off but Michael Caine kept me watching ) as the character of Fat Bastard seriously offended me . I don't think it's fair to make Scotland the butt of such a vile , xenophobic joke . But , I guess that's as far as Myer's imagination goes when creating characters as everyone here in this film is nothing more than a cultural stereotype . Quite irresponsible for a wannabe-blockbuster . I wish I could say that if I ignore a monster such as this , it would go away . But that just won't happen . Let's just thank our lucky stars that no more Austin Powers films have been made since this drek .
564849	102816	225703	1.0	Am I the only one who found this really offensive ?	I remember when I was 11 and in Primary Seven ( which works out at Sixth Grade if your American ) when our teacher took the class through to the screening room to watch yet another sex education video . By this point , even as a bunch of 11-year-olds , we were all pretty jaded by this constant sex-ed stuff and rolled our eyes at having to suffer yet more ( this continued all they way to late-High School BTW , which we all found quite odd ) . The video in question that day ( and many days after that ) was Feeling Yes , Feeling No ; a Canadian Stage play acted out in front of kids younger than us on what to do if an adult sexually harasses you . Just say ( or shout ) NO was the answer . It had the sophistication of a 16-mm interstitial on Seasame Street . I remember it vividly to this day . And I remember being very offended by it , along with a lot of the other boys in my class . The reason for this is that every scenario acted out is a man taking advantage of or abusing a girl . I mean , does it never happen the other way around ? Will a woman never abuse a boy ? This aspect was stupidly left out and made the series entirely one-sided and just plain wrong . Honestly . After watching all these us guys felt guilty for no reason . We had done nothing wrong but were made to feel like sexual predators all because of this stupid series . We were all quite downcast for a few days and repeatedly voiced our anger at the teacher who typically ignored us . Even the girls treated us differently , saying stuff like ' You're all rapists . ' Which is just plain wrong no matter what way you look at it . This series of ' educational ' films is wrong and hopelessly sexist . I am sure something this old is not shown in schools anymore and I pray that something more PC ( and trust me , I HATE PC ) is part of sex-ed now . Oh , and what a god-awful ' theme ' song too . I don't think I'll ever get it out of my head . Like the Macarena or Agadoo .
564043	102816	93300	1.0	Pant-wettingly hilarious	There's no new bad things I can say about this film as they are all pretty much common knowledge ( like how can someone have flashbacks of events they never witnessed ? ) . But I will say that no collection is complete without this movie . It is so wretchedly bad it's funny . First of all , hardly anybody gets eaten . After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history . . . to the Bahamas ! Total change of scenery huh ? Jaws follows . How ? Don't ask me . And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum . Her elder son works as a marine biologist ( surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean ) and is studying sea snails ( presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3 ) . By pure coincidence ( or contrivance ) , Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research . The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake . It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth . And it's incredibly stupid . The shark in the first film ( and in the surprisingly good second ) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning . But now it's just a big lumbering idiot . Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me . He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey . And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera . The worst thing tho , isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles ' Jamaican accent . It's the ending . Let me explain what happens . . . Jaws stands on his tail ! On the Water ! ! Roars like a Lion ! ! ! Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship . . . . . . and explodes ! ! ! ! Of course ! Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery . The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius . It should also be noted that this version includes the happy ( alternate ) ending in Mario Van Peebles survives being chomped across the belly by the big fish . This new DVD release by Universal improves upon the shoddy , OOP Goodtimes release . Gone is the snapper cover , now we have a sturdy keepcase . The picture is now anamorphic and although the 2 . 35 : 1 frame has some dirt on it , it's rather sharp . The Dolby 2 . 0 soundtrack is just about average though . The only extra is a trailer .
564114	102816	323531	1.0	Mother Theresa in a gangbang ! What is this ? ? ?	Either Steven Seagal has absolutely NO self-respect or the Mob were just too damn scary for him when it came to signing the contract for this total pile of crap . They couldn't even be bothered to come up with an good title . Instead the took Hard to Kill and Out for Justice and combined them ( Hard to Justice ? ) . But don't even think for one minute that this film is up to the standards of Seagal's golden years . You'll NEVER see anything worse than this . Well , Son of the Mask maybe . Seagal plays an archaeologist ( well , it's a change from Cop or ex-CIA ) who's precious Chinese artifacts and pots are seized by the Tong ( the non-threatening Chinese Syndicate baddies ) and stuffed with brown sugar ( or cocaine , I don't know ) . Big Steve stumbles upon this dastardly deed and takes off for the Uzbekistan border . A hundred baddies come out of nowhere and start firing at him . Big Steve is promptly framed and sent to jail , where he meets a character introduced as his new sidekick but is quickly forgotten about and never seen or heard from again . What the hell was the point in this ? It turns out that Steve used to be in the CIA ( oh for the love of crumb cake ) and was their best ghost thief ( huh ? ) and the DEA release him for some reason and he goes home to his quiet American suburb , where the Tong blow up his wife and house . Steve goes on a killing spree . But what helps is that every Chinaman who's neck he breaks has a one-word tattoo on his arm that when added up makes an ancient Chinese proverb that provides the right order of tiles to push in case of fire in the Tong bosses office . What ? Don't look at me ! I didn't write this ! The bad guys don't do anything apart from sit at a long table in a poorly-lit and cold-looking room and smoke cigars while looking evil . The boss isn't even Chinese but an Ian Hislop-lookalike with bushy eyebrows . Every 10 minutes the film will jump to them ( subtitles list their hobbies and interests for some strange reason ! ) and the boss goes ' We have to stop him , he knows too much ' . The fight scenes are horrible . What is the deal with the kung-fu monkey barber ? Seriously ! What is the deal with that ? The computer-generated effects are the worst ever ( second to Son of the Mask , nothing will beat that in terms of terribleness ) . I've seen more convincing stuff on a ZX Spectrum . Seagal puts NO effort into this film . He looks incredibly bored through-out and looks like he'd rather be praying to Budda . However , you can almost see Frankie Fingers from The Mob loitering off-camera , pointing a gun at his head . I know I wouldn't show enthusiasm if that were the case . Out for a Kill is directed by Mike Oblonglowiscz , the same amateur responsible for the equally as horrible The Foreigner . The man has NO idea how to make films and should never be allowed near a camera again . He desperately tries to mime Michael Bay ( a dubious choice of inspiration ) with his pointless stutter-cuts and incoherent editing which only makes the film look worse , turning it into an avalanche on top of another avalanche . It's quite possibly one of the ugliest-looking film you'll ever see . Considering some of the high-profile and veteran production members it's phenomenal they made a film so indescribably bad . Eternal , everlasting shame on all those involved with making this trash . Utter crap of the lowest order . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen , showing off the ugly photography and poorly planned camera angles in all their rubbishy glory . The Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack also turns the films unbelievably bad sound design into pure torture for the ears . The cover also features 2 exploding helicopters . There are no helicopters in the entire film , never mind exploding ones .
564622	102816	95271	1.0	Shockingly bad !	It's frightening to think that if this movie was never made we would never have been subjected to the dreck that is Halloween 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 . And the double shame is that even tho the story here is silly it is at least interesting . The continuation of this was the only decent thing about Halloween 5 and it may well have been good in 6 too but that movie all rearranged and jumbled before it hit out screens . So what we have here is a collection of dull murders with bad story continuity . H20 and Resurrection pretended that 4 , 5 and 6 never happened . There is no REAL backbone or history to this series . All they represent is a producer who asks us to pay money for the same thing over and over . We cannot use photocopied money to pay for our tickets at the box office so the movie-makers owe us something new . And in Halloween 4 we don't get it . In fact I'm sure that to the untrained eye Halloween 4 and 5 could very well be the same movie . And it is SO slow ! Nothing really happens for about 70 minutes worth of the movies 88 minute running time . It leaves you begging for a Jason Voorhees style mass murder spree . That does not happen I'm sorry to say . The movie cuts away at the point of every death and when it doesn't the deaths are dull and boring . A man is thrown onto an electrical power grid and . . . sparks fly . That's it ? How about his face melting or at least getting set on fire ? Plus the body count is shockingly low . What is up with the thumb thru the head ? Not only is it badly shot , too quick and just plain puzzling ( surely a quick neck snap would be easier and nastier ) the physical possibilities of it match hammering a tack into a concrete slab . It just can't happen . I don't care how superhuman Michael Myers unexplained powers are . The whole ' motiveless psycho ' may have worked well in Carpenter's original but here it's asking for money for old rope . Carpenter used it to great effect and scriptwriter Alan B . McElroy ( responsible for some awesome Spawn episodes ) uses it as an excuse for lazy , unimaginative writing . Tho he has the scriptwriters strike to blame as he beat the deadline by mere hours . But even a few hours worth more imagination could have made this the tiniest bit better . There's just not much for Myers to do . He comes out of a coma , goes back to Haddonfield and kills . For no reason . There are no sets other than houses and no opportunity for big excitement or set-pieces . I'm sorry but the ' famous ' rooftop scene is boring , badly rehearsed and badly shot . Director Dwight H . Little ( Marked For Death , Murder at 1600 ) even throws in a 10 second scene in an Elementary school for no reason . Plus the only shot of Michael in this shows him with WHITE hair on his mask . A pretty big goof , lookout for it . Out of all the lessons in how to make an effective horror film that were were taught in the first film none of them are really echoed here . Slasher flicks by their very nature are low brow but Carpenter had a simplistic purity and charm that made it work . Plus he filmed the movie in Panavision which instantly gives it some class . Plus he used the widescreen framing well . Dwight H . Little seems oblivious to this and instead uses standard 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen with no particular flare . And I must mention the very poor dialogue . It offers no insight into the lives of the teenagers in the story or provides them with extra character . Why are we supposed to care when they get killed . It's obvious from the beginning that they are nothing but fodder for Michael Myers . And it's a crime that when they die it's not even graphic or ugly in the slightest . Just boring and badly shot . It's not a horror film because nothing horrifies or upsets other than paying money to see it . Stay well away . Go watch a Friday the 13th movie and see the J-Man do his thing . Anchor Bay presents this DVD in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen . The print is grainy and rather dirty . Nothing of reference quality . Sorry . There soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5 . 1 from the original Ultra Stereo tracks . It's good enough . One hardly expects a sophisticated soundtrack from a film of this nature . In fact I prefer it to the obnoxiously loud sound designs of more recent slasher flicks . A 16 minute documentary , offering new interesting insight to the movie , is included . The participants don't have much to say and seem to regard the film in a higher manner than it deserves . An original theatrical poster replica poses as the cover on a ' 4-page booklet ' ( wow-1 sheet of paper ) containing some more info about the movie . The DVD itself comes in one of those beautiful Limited Edition Tins . My copy is number 05 , , 000 .
563938	102816	440272	1.0	Crap	What a horrible game ! I would describe Dick Tracy as a run-and-gun platformer but that would kind of a lie as it is horrible slow and plodding with no sense of excitement at all . It's one of those horrible games where that generic baddies shoot at you and you see this little white dot that is supposed to be a bullet move across the screen very slowly . In real life it would easy to dodge but the little Dick Tracy sprite moves likes he's stuck in cement . There are some levels where you shoot the place up but you can do very little damage and since nothing becomes of it other than the background changing slightly , it's kinda pointless . The music is awful too . Who makes these awful tunes ? The graphics do resemble the bright primary colors of the comic-strip though and it's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this otherwise completely disposable game . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564459	102816	348150	1.0	Worst film of Summer 2006	In a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code , that's a pretty bold statement . But I stand by it nonetheless . Superman Returns , like King Kong 6 months before it , is overlong , hyper-indulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs . My God , this stuff is doing my head in . Richard Donner had the idea of ' keep it real ' for his 2 outings . And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate . Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend $250 million ( a totally irresponsible amount of money ) on obnoxious visual effects that don't live up to the hype . We've seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us . There's no real atmosphere or involvement in this . And for a film that is 95 % made up of this crap . . . well you figure it out . I've read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has ' soul ' or ' a human heart ' or ' tender character moments ' . Puh-lease ! We've already had brooding superheros silently screaming ' you'd love me if you knew who I am ' dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard . Even the plot is recycled garbage . Lex Luthor ( a seriously mis-cast and hammy Kevin Spacey ) plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already ! And , well . . . that's your lot ! It's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2 . 5 painful hours ! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable . But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat-stand , Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist , James Marsden is 250 % wooden , as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement . The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey . But I'm into weird-looking girls . Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic . Pretty soon we'll have $300 million films . Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up . For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of crap , for all the resources that this movie cost to make . . . was it worth it ? In my opinion , certainly not ! This garbage has put me of Superman for life !
563894	102816	483986	1.0	Ew !	This is the worst game . I guess the first Galaxy Force game was so good it warranted a sequel . I'm not kidding when I say I made games better than this in 10 minutes on my old Commodore 64 . I just unearthed this rubbish today after doing a little spring cleaning . I remembered it being trash but just needed to play it a little to jog my memory as to why . Basically , all you do in this game is fly thru a ' 3-dimensional ' generic space level shooting things . You never miss . Even if you are in the top right or bottom left firing in the wrong direction , whatever boring weapon you have will eventually kill the non-threatening baddies . There's no story , just shooting . And the graphics are horrible . On the first level when you ' penetrate the enemy fortress ' the worst graphics ever make an appearance . Ugh ! It was horrid . To think that the RRP of this game was £39 . 99 when it was first released . I'm glad I never bought it . It just sort of appeared in my house . Trust me , it really is rank ! The arcade version may well have been good but the Sega Genesis version has it's own spot in hell .
564344	102816	437481	1.0	Horrid	I loved the first Sonic Adventure game ( Gamecube remake ) and I only expected this one to be as good , if not better . But , boy was I wrong . It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original . The graphics are ugly , the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive . Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game ? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again ? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure . Do not buy or rent . I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it .
564216	102816	92106	1.0	I absolutely hated this !	First of all I will admit that the level of animation is far , far superior to the frequently goof-ridden TV series and that Transformers : The Movie looks more like Akira or Ghost in the Shell than the show . It add a whole new level integrity to the Transformer's universe but it's a damn shame that the story had to be crap of the lowest order . I know that many people are going to hate for this and call me cynical but this is not a movie . It's an 85 minute toy commercial . Many of the Autobots and Decepticon's die ( including Starscream , thank God , he truly was irritating ) but are soon replaced by new characters . It's like Hasbro was subliminally telling kids to throw out the old toys and go buy new ones . Set in the unfathomably distant future of 2005 , when we'll be living on the moon and skating around on hover-boards , the gobbledygook plot involves a giant planet-eating robot planet ( umm . . . okay ? ) and his mission to destroy the ' Autobot Matrix of Leadership ' , which is obviously Optimus Prime . It begins with the Autobots and Decepticons doing their usual battle of blowing up each other's stuff but what is bugging is that in the show they never get hit or die if they do , but here loads of them are killed-off easily and without any particular attention . I know I complained that none ever die in the series before but when they are blown apart and fall down while barely getting a single line of dialogue it's kind of . . . disrespectful . And none of these new characters have the same appeal . Once Optimus Prime is dead the new leader , Ultra Magnus , doesn't yield his authority or leadership with any special flair . Megatron is left to die , while floating in the depths of space and is reconfigured / evolved by the robot planet ( who's name is Unicron btw ) into Galvatron . Who doesn't seem to be any kind of eviler , just a new toy . And the robot voiced by Judd Nelson ( his names escapes me at the moment ) is just another generic Autobot good guy . The Matrix of Leadership happens to be a glowing ball in Optimus Prime's chest and when Ultra Magnus get his hands on it the movie could have become a ' chase for the bland MacGuffin ' kind of story . But it continues to meander and go in eccentric / weird directions . The subplot involving the junk planet and the shark-bots and the judge and jury who execute robots for being guilty AND innocent is just baffling . What the hell is all that about ? And even worse is the guff with the dancing biker-type robots with the leader voiced by Eric Idle . I mean . . . what ? Either I accidentally took an acid and went on a weird trip last night or this film is just plain mince . The main thing that makes this film so inaccessible is the almost total exclusion of human characters . An older Spike is in it for a few seconds and his son Daniel has a bit of character development . But where is Sparkplug ? Where are any other humans ? About 2 minutes of it is set on earth and everything else , set in space , seems kind of alienating . I know we've seen the Transformers battle on Earth loads of times before in the TV show but this sudden switch of locale and whole new assortment of characters made it feel like something I had no familiarity with . I realise that the transition between seasons 2 and 3 had to be steep and drastic ( a 20 year story gap and loads of new toys . . . sorry characters ) but it needs more time to develop than this and everything feels rushed and hasty with no focus on pacing , coherence or character . The constant 80s rock is kind of fun though . I truly miss this kind of hedonistic music , it may not fit the film terrible well but it has a nice kind of nostalgia to it . Vividly animated it may well be , but I found this film to be so asinine that I have taken down my Transformers posters and lessened my interest in them . Don't get me wrong , I will still watch Seasons 3 and 4 , but I can only do it with a more cynical and distrustful eye .
564346	102816	317303	1.0	Eddie hits a new low .	To be honest I still had some respect left for Eddie Murphy before this . He just seemed to have lost his way in the 21st century . But nothing will ever make forgive this . He's just went all ' kiddie ' in recent years . And it's sick . In the 80's Murphy gave us strong African-American characters like Reggie Hammond , Billy Ray Valentine , Axel Foley and Prince Akeem . But that was a long time ago . And it's a shame to see him trade a hard edge for movies like this . It's so sugary it is literally sickening . It's about as subtle as a brick in the face too . Annoying kids who are obviously reading phonetically off oversized cue-cards held off camera , David Newman's worse than generic ' family movie ' score , clockwork predictability and toilet humor ( how many more family movies are going to milk fart sounds for all their worth ? ) are all you can expect from this film . Staring directly into the sun is not as painful on the eyes as this .
563904	102816	90859	1.0	Moribund	There may be some major spoilers in this review . I wish to give a frank , honest and revealing review of this film . So I'll begin with ? ? What were they thinking ? This has got to be one of the most preposterously and poorly conceived films ever . And I mean EVER ! Listen to this . The script was taken from the novel FAIR GAME by Paula Gosling ( which was later turned into a film of the same name that bears NO resemblance to this ) and has nothing really to do with that novel . But the script was also taken from Stallone's original script for Beverly Hills Cop ( as he was supposed to be the original Axel Foley ) and it bears no resemblance to that film either . And in Beverly Hills Cop 2 you can see a poster for this movie in Judge Reinhold's apartment . And Brigitte Neilson even stars in Beverly Hills Cop 2 as well as this movie . Weird . But more about the plot . There is this crazy guy called ' The Night-Slasher ' ( so called because he slashes at night ) who has a huge gang of ' hunters ' ( nameless goons ) and he wants to take over the world by creating a ' new order ' . Whatever that means , I don't know . But apparently it consists of driving around in a beat up van and murdering blondes . A rather odd strategy indeed and not one that I'm sure will work as Stallone is on the case . But of course his Superiors don't want his help . They would rather sort it out on their own in a ' quiet and civilised ' manner . They don't do a very good job of that as all they do is stand about the Police Station saying , ' We've got to catch this guy ' . But Stallone has better ideas . He goes downtown to shakedown tattoo artists and cross-dressing transvestites . That's no joke . Because of the 80's music playing over these scenes we cannot hear what Stallone is saying but I assume it is something like ' Hey , have you guys seen the Night Slasher ' . Good job he's on the case huh ? But matters are complicated when a beautiful model ( Brigitte Neilson ) witnesses the pointless murder of a random woman . The Night Slasher memorises her license plate before making sure that he shows enough of his face for her to recognise him in a line-up . So Stallone takes her out to the mountains where he murders all of the Night Slashers ' goons without getting a scratch on him or running out of ammo . Then he leads the Night Slasher into a furnace ( which just happens to ' be there ' in the middle of a vineyard ) where he hangs the Night Slasher out to dry . Cosmatos made Rambo : First Blood Part II in widescreen , but not this movie . I reckon if there were a bigger screen and more thought given to composition and style this could have been a worthwhile experience . After all terrible movies can still look good ( Broken Arrow for example ) and it would have been slightly less embarrassing and cringeworthy to watch . Even at 87 minutes this film is REALLY pushing it . There are no decent characters or any memorable dialogue or anything at all to recommend it . Sure , you can watch it for the wrong reasons . You can laugh at George Pan Cosmatos ' uninspired direction and Stallone thinking that he could turn the Cobra into a franchise . We should thank our lucky stars that didn't happen . Stick with the Rambo movies instead and leave this mistake alone .
564650	102816	348121	2.0	Worst animated film I have EVER seen .	To think I could have just rented Steamboy and got it over and done with . But it was only the UK Theatrical cut that was available to rent and with a Director's Cut available in a limited edition box set out there I had to be a snob and go buy that . What a complete waste of money . Steamboy is a steaming pile of crap ! The only thing I liked about it was the quaint depiction of olden-days English countryside . The rest was so phenomenally boring , that I was almost falling asleep . James Ray Steam ( voiced by Anna Paquin , sounding more like a Gaelic South-African than a boy from Manchester ) is the grandson of some good scientist and the son of some bad scientist . . . blah blah blah . . . steam power . . . blah blah blah . . . war machines . Christ almighty , I am sending myself into terminal coma even summarising this guff ! The cover makes it look like some sort of exciting superhero story . But all of the action happens in the last 10 minutes . Everything before this is so , so unbelievably slow . Every line of dialogue so flat . Every character bland as living hell . I wish to erase this film from my memory forever and I am extremely bitter over the 2 hours I WASTED watching it .
564424	102816	120786	3.0	So boring I forgot that it even existed	The Patriot ( nothing to do with the Mel Gibson film of the same name ) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that ' saving the environment ' thing in his movies . Which is fine . But it doesn't make for good action . When the plot ( ? ) of this film finally kicked in I saw the twist ( ? ) coming a mile off . Seagal's anti-warfare , care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle . For a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a TV movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by Dean Semler , the photographer of Dances with Wolves . Steven Seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring . As an action film it fails , as a drama it stinks , as an environmental message it's obvious . Avoid like Ebola crossed with plague .
564002	102816	472167	3.0	Boring	If you suffer from insomnia then Radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7-year coma . The film is so preposterously overwrought and mundane that it's hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could overlook such obvious dullness . The story has an exiled Doctor ( who we never get to see ) move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can combat any infection ( yes , just like that episode of Futurama ) . The vaccines don't work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours . Not wanting to be caught by the Government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover , hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus . All of this is narrated by Michael , the only one of the quartet immune to the infection . And it's the most boring narration ever . They could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen . On top of this the editor insists on fade-cutting more than half the movie , giving it a weird dream-like feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep . It's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this , I was not one of them for some reason . But I bloody well should have . The ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding . But it's plain and simply not . A relief yes , but not dramatic in the slightest . The utter cheapness of this production and muffled sound that renders a lot of the dialogue unintelligible cripples what could have been an interesting sci-fi story if it had better actors , cooler locations and a sense of urgency . As it is , Radiant is a snoozefest .
564323	102816	120633	3.0	What the hell is going on in this movie ?	Courtroom dramas are so out of date . Which is why this sub-genre is confined mostly to rubbishy TV-movies these days . In A Civil Action there was just too much legal jargon for me to understand . If find that most audiences feel a bit alienated by technical gobbledygook . The comedy wasn't really funny and seemed out of place . Most characters just seemed to be nameless . There were just too many to remember and they weren't really all that interesting to begin with . The film also had very little drama . It was quite a labor to get through this guff . I think it was never really intended to be more than a potboiler . Catch it on TV if you're that desperate . It's where it belongs .
564517	102816	93201	4.0	Very odd	It's weird how the writer / director of such exciting blockbusters such as ID4 and The Patriot could create such a strange film . I'll try my hardest to recount the plot . Two ultra-cheap filmmakers ( art reflects life ) have a great idea for a movie and rope in an unwilling but attractive starlet and make up a Muppet-like monster based on the photographs of a long-dead grandfather's butler . A rival studio producer wants to blow up the grandfather's house as the climax to his big budget movie so the butler's ghost comes back to possess the Muppet doll to lead them to hidden billions in the cellar . It's not a bad film , by no means , it's quite cringe-worthy in places but inconsistently entertaining . There are no big name stars or SFX but that is made up for with bizarre plotting and storyline . This film is more in the style of Roland Emmerich in his Making Contact / Moon 44 days . But if he had the budget he gets these days who knows what this film might have ended up as . I give it for weirdness , plot and defying convention .
564360	102816	110725	4.0	Grossly over-indulgent vanity piece	At the height of his fame Seagal was allowed to direct this monstrosity about evil Texas oil Aegis company polluting Alaska . With no prior experience in directing Steve stampeded his way into this movie with as much subtlety as a brick in the face . Originally called ' Spirit Warrior ' and hoping to cast loads of English baddies ( among them Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons ) the film is a horrid example of far too much creative control given to one man too blinkered by his own agenda to bother giving us anything resembling decent storytelling . There is nothing significant or exceptional about Seagal's direction . Nor is the action very well done . It's cut too lazily and not shot for maximum viewing clarity . But what reeks about the story is that some big oil magnate called Michael Jennings ( a completely hammy Michael Caine ) wants to build a really shoddy oil rig in Alaska made out of dodgy parts because the rights to the land are about to revert back to the Eskimos after 30 years of non-use . So why wait 30 years to build the bloody thing ? Seagal plays Forrest Taft , an oil rig fireman who suddenly develops a conscience and is promptly eliminated from the payroll by way of being blown up . Only he is rescue by the Eskimos and , this is where the film just goes insane , goes on a spiritual journey in which he wrestles bears and turns into eagles and stuff . I mean , what the hell is all that about ? ? ? Don't even get me started on the scene where he makes a fully-grown hard-ass redneck cry in a bar full of similar stereotypes when the philosophy touches his soul . Then he gets his old self back together and sets about righting all the wrongs of Aegis Oil and saving the environment by littering it with dead bad guys . Jennings hires a bunch of mercenaries ( including R . Lee Ermey and Billy Bob Thornton ) to take out Taft but of course they all prove to be useless since Taft is revealed to be an ex-CIA Agent ( oh dear God . . ) Nothing much really happens apart from shooting and dying and Seagal beating up nameless extras . We've seen all of this before and it's no different this time round . I do appreciate his environmentally friendly attitude but it could have made it a little less obvious and campy . Seagal's tacked on speech at the end originally ran for 30 minutes ( Jeezuz sufferin ' ) but Warner finally stepped in and said a big no-no . We could have had an Oliver Stone or Insider amount of paranoia and conspiracy but this just ends up as the worst of Seagal's Hollywood movies .
563789	102816	41521	4.0	I guess they were running short of money	This cartoon is one of the earliest forms of a ' clip show ' that I have seen . You've seen ( and no doubt been annoyed ) the episodes of The Simpsons where they go ' remember when ' before cutting to old footage , thus trimming down on the cost of original production . Well , that's what happens here . Tom is planning the usual amount of torture for Jerry when the radio warns him that it is ' Be Nice To Animals Day ' . Convinced that he should be kind for once , Tom bakes the mouse a cake , grabs some presents and waits by his hole . But Jerry ain't home , and it's a perfect opportunity for Tom to grab his diary and reminisce about all the time the mouse got the better of him , cue the old footage . One to skip .
564327	102816	942385	4.0	Why does Tom Cruise ?	There's nothing in Tropic Thunder that you haven't seen Ben Stiller spoof before , and spoof better , in five minute clips such as Mission : Improbable or Die Hard 12 : Die Hungry . His character of Tugg Speedman is yet another one of his many un-self-aware stereotypes like Derek Zoolander or White Goodman . Besides this , what is most disappointing about Tropic Thunder is the fact that Stiller had all the pieces to make a truly great and sublime comedy , but he messed it up . Yes , I did laugh here and there but I'm afraid that most of the jokes miss the mark and the comic timing is a little bit off . The randomness of some scenes defy the internal logic and seem like they belong in a different film . I was wishing for a sharp satire on modern Hollywood , but all we get are unironic bad-taste gags . The fake trailers in the opening are the best part . The cast are mostly wasted , and the motivations of their stupid actions seem to be lost on them , the actors they are playing and the roles those actors are playing . Get your head around that . I think that Stiller got a little muddled when writing the script . They never really kill anyone and we never know if they are firing blanks or not . And if they are , why don't they pick up some real guns when they have the chance ? It's better than Zoolander by a million miles , though it's really sad how a film this flat and uninspired blows the box office away while something like Last Action Hero , a very similar film which is a hundred times as good , ends up being a flop and laughed at whenever it's brought up in conversation . Do yourself a favor , skip Tropic Thunder and spent the night inside with the DVD of Arnie's misunderstood 1993 epic .
564844	102816	62765	4.0	Not impressed !	Somewhere inside the overlong , 114-minute Bullitt there is a brisk 90-minute long film desperate to get out . But as it is , it's seriously overlong with nothing to sustain it . Many pointless scenes come and go with loads of long , indulgent tracking shots goose-up the running time . I almost nodded-off a few times , I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this film . The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed ( he's not actually killed until about an hour later though ) . A local politician ( Robery Vaughn , who didn't really want to do the film ) acts as the token bureaucrat , standing in the way of getting things done . But getting WHAT done exactly ? In 114 minutes almost NOTHING happens in this damn movie ! Instead of mystery , clues , police procedure , shoot-outs and problem-solving we're treated to scene after scene of . . . not much . Bullitt eats food at the hospital , he goes shopping for celery and TV dinners , he hangs around with his girlfriend ( a completely pointless character played by Jaqueline Bissett ) and sometimes takes a passing interest in the case . About 80-minutes into this bore he is FINALLY involved in a car chase ( THE car chase that everyone raves about ) that ' tears up ' the streets of San Francisco . I don't understand why this film has so much adoration or why all the fans proclaim it's ' the original and best ' , ' the one that started it all ' or any other generic soundbite you can think of . There were cop movies before this , there were car chases before this . What exactly is Bullitt credited with ' starting ' ? A sense of being cool , calm and collected doesn't turn water into wine . Bullitt is plain , repetitive , agonizingly slow and almost completely without a plot . Don't consider me a philistine or someone who has been brainwashed by the over-edited nature of modern films where we're guaranteed and explosion every five minutes . I appreciate films from all eras and from all backgrounds . But Bullitt is just way , way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with . A real disappointment .
564704	102816	161977	4.0	Atmospheric , but extremely boring .	Simon Magus is a weirdo living in some peasant country shire who every hates because he talks to the devil and plants . He's Jewish but isn't allowed to be a proper Jew because he's weird . So he tries to be a Christian , which the local priests are happy to help with since it will deplete the Jewish manpower , thus giving them more muscle in the future trading of the village once a new railway station is built . Are you bored already listening to this ? Imagine having to suffer through the whole film . The only good thing Simon Magus has going for it is the wonderful widescreen photography and lovely English countryside locations . Other than that you'll be needing caffeine pills to stay awake during the boredom . It seems like an ' epic ' student film with lofty ambitions but there's a massive amateurish feel to it . The sound design just doesn't seem right and some of the editing looks like it's been done on a home computer . Actors like Iain Holme and Rutger Hauer come and go with no real effect on the film or the viewer . Both of them look thoroughly bored and wish to vacate the premises immediately . I wouldn't bother with this film , it has nothing to offer apart from pretty scenery . And you can go out for a drive in your car if you want that .
564269	102816	490198	4.0	Both incarnations are nothing more than average .	I had the Predator 2 video game on the Commodore 64 . The graphics were horrible , but the side-scrolling first-person shooter gameplay was involving if far inferior to the likes of Operation Wolf . I never made it to the end . The Sega Genesis version is an isometric platformer that has almost nothing to do with the film . Once again you play as Mike Harrigan , Danny Glover's character in the film , and you run about killing drug dealers and rescuing hostages . It's only 4 levels long and it gets very boring very quickly . Plus , it's quite easy . To charge £39 . 99 for a game like this back in the day is robbery . Only serious fans of the film should bother to check out these games . If the Genesis had been an upgraded version of the Commodore 64 approach to the game then it would have been much better . As it is , both games are tepid and inoffensively average .
564167	102816	203701	4.0	I never really liked this much	I know this is going to sound like sacrilege but I was never a fan of the Mortal Kombat games . Having played Street Fighter and Fatal fury before it I just didn't see much point in another fighting franchise . Plus , the digitised graphics , which were supposed to be ' groundbreaking ' and make us all go ' ooohhh , ahhh ' were just really rubbish . They were so blocky and resembled just a few big , chunky pixels vaguely in the shape of a human . I tired of it pretty quickly I'm afraid to say but a few months after I stopped playing it I went back after finding cheat codes in a magazine to restore the censored gore . But even that was dumb ! A gallon of blood splattered into the air every time you punched someone and it just looked so stupid that it had no edge . And then later on I got the cheats for the finishing movies and ' babalities ' and ' animalities ' or whatever such nonsense . But by that point they just took it too far and I never went back to it again . And the sequels never took my interest either . Not the best fighting game by far .

564669	102816	469232	4.0	REALLY simple platformer	This game was pretty much the simplest kind you could ever get . You played a small alien dude with a big round helmet on a strange planet . The object of each level was to jump onto a platform that was moving back and forth . Then onto another one , moving slightly faster . And so on and so on . Ten platforms , ten levels . That was it . That's not to say it wasn't kinda cute and it did have the slightest re-playability . I have no idea what ' Zub ' actually meant but in the instructions it stood for a variety of words . It's also the first word that my then 3-year-old cousin managed to read . If you come across an emulator for this very , very basic game then I still recommend you give it a quick go .

564078	102816	417148	4.0	More Zzzzz than Sssss	I was quite looking forward to this film as I enjoyed David R . Ellis ' previous film Cellular and the poster and idea for Snakes on a Plane is just pure high-concept trash . I could have been great , but I was surprisingly bored through-out . I do like popcorn movies , but the popcorn has to taste good and this bucket just has far too much venom in it for me . After Final Destination 2 and Cellular , David R . Ellis seems to be New Line Cinema's king of B-movies . Since the departure of Ronny Yu from this project , he seemed like the most logical choice . And while he does use some innovative ideas ( such as the pretty cool ' snake vision ' ) the film is too darkly shot and edited like a blur . I don't find death to be funny and expected a stronger ' man vs nature ' subtext to it . What we get is a man being bitten on the penis and stoners bitten while joining the Mile High Club . And the sudden , stinging attacks never seem to frighten . The first few kills are crass and exploitative and it spoils the mood for the rest of the film . I know I am being ridiculous criticising a no-brainer film such as this in such a way but even low-grade B-movies like Anaconda and it's sequel managed to be more scary and exciting than this . The characters are set-up in the typical horror film way and it's obvious which ones are going to die one by one . And while their deaths appear to violent , you never REALLY see anything shocking . A film with such an eccentric title really should have gone to crazy , far-fetched extremities and delivered loads of gore . But it never truly seems like it does . The majority of the film seems taped together from various different writers ideas and some scenes definitely feel tacked on after principal photography . Films set on panic-stricken planes are abundant ( Exec Dec , Passenger 57 , United 93 , Con Air , Die Hard 2 ) and scenes of crash landings and decompression are nothing new to audiences . The presence of Snakes doesn't make it much different . Plus , Trevor Rabin's score is total crap . Plain and simple . Uninspired , generic rubbish completely without theme , melody , excitement our even coherence in it's endless bombasticness . I had great hopes for him when he did such brilliant work ( actually co-composing ) on Con Air and Armageddon , but he's fast proving to be talentless . Samuel L . Jackson is brilliant as always and the under-rated Julianna Margulies is quite bloody gorgeous , more so than more popular Hollywood actresses . Lin Shaye ( a popular New Line actress , since her husband runs the studio ) has more to do than usual in the role of a heroic stewardess and those of you who like her more comedic roles will find this a welcome change . Though there's not much else I can recommend . After all the internet-nerd hype surrounding this film , it fails to live up to potential and expectations . Quite a disappointment !
564686	102816	29237	4.0	Boring and predictable	Mickey cartoons all follow the same formula . Whatever he's doing will soon fall into chaos as soon as Donald shows up or whatever he's in charge of inexplicable rebels . In this cartoon , nothing is different . He's hosting an amateur music show on the radio and Donald forgets the lyrics to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star . He's not happy about being booed and won't give up even after being kicked off . Clara Cow ( or whoever ) and Goofy turn up with some failed acts ( both interrupted by Donald ) that go haywire in the most predictable of fashions . Not that funny and not that interesting . So much so that I did the hoovering while watching it .
564320	102816	133751	4.0	Rather bland and mediocre	It was hardly revolutionary , I mean its only saving grace was its ensemble cast . I think Famke Jansen is totally hot and Clea Duvall especially , she's just totally gorgeous . Not enough gore either . In , fact there's not much else to The Faculty . The cheap CGI effects were pretty crap and the post-Scream script by over-celebrated writer Kevin Williamson is too self-aware and modern to be effective . In a few years , this kind of thing is going to seem dated . I guess it was entertaining in a silly kind of way which it was supposed to be but it could have been a LOT better . Not the kind of film I would watch again .
564268	102816	388482	5.0	Disappointing sequel	The Transporter franchise suffers from some serious engine failure in this slickly produced sequel and only just makes it over the finishing line . The original had a thin premise and an anorexic plot but delivered brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and down-played gun violence . For number 2 the action is relocated from the French Riviera to Miami , a city often featured in bad sequel movies ( 2 Fast 2 Furious , Bad Boys II , Police Academy 5 ) . Frank Martin ( a skin-headed , forever grimacing Jason Statham ) no longer takes dodgy package from A to B , instead he's temping as a chauffeur for a wealthy family . But when the kid is snatched by stereotyped Columbian villain he springs back into action , kicking ass in his own special way . It turns out that the kid has been injected with a deadly virus . And everyone he breathes on will catch it . And so on and so on . An interesting plot device that soon crumbles into a massive pile of plot holes . The action doesn't have the same edge as it did before . I can appreciate far-fetched action films as long as they stay within relative distance of reality . Transporter 2 goes way beyond reality in well into stupidity , turning Frank Martin from delivery man into indestructible super-hero . After a while you'll realize this man can do anything and will always walk out of the worst scenario alive . It totally kills the excitement . And as if the plot wasn't flimsy enough , the narrative just completely shatters and will leave you disorientated and lost among the brawling and battling . Characters come and go with no explanation , sub-plots are abandoned and the film is totally void of a denouement or climax . There's no satisfaction in the silly story being wrapped up . All Transporter 2 really does is showcase a bunch of totally far-fetched fight scenes , while failing at everything else that could have made the film a contender . Even the relentlessly silly Danny the Dog did better than this . Even though it's made by a European director and producer and funded with European money , something that gave the first such a unique feel , this feels an awful lot like a Hollywood trash flick . It's a shame the series had to stumble so soon . Since the end hints a third , one can only hope that Leterrier and Besson get their act together . What began as a series made in the style of Taxi , Ronin and Kiss of the Dragon has ended up tumbling into world where movies like Stealth and SWAT live . And that ain't good . Oh , and I'm tired of hearing about the movie's so-called homo-eroticism . Like I just said , this film is made by Europeans who are not as homophobic as the rest of the world and see nothing wrong with a man visiting another man for a holiday . Frank Martin is not gay .
564245	102816	30447	5.0	Polly wanna cracker	Can someone explain to my why Polly is a common name for a parrot ? And why do they have a fascination for crackers ? I've never seen a real life parrot each a cracker . In this cartoon a moving van goes over a nasty bump and a birdcage falls out . The newly freed parrot inside immediately flies into Mickey's house where Mickey mistakes his noisy presence as an invasion by escaped convict Machine-gun Charlie ( or something ) . This is the set-up for the usual hijinks seen in Disney cartoons in which everything Mickey , Donald or Goofy owns is trashed because of their own clumsiness . Something different it ain't .
563978	102816	185014	5.0	Not much going on	For a film that has such interesting characters we only scratch the surface if exploring them fully . Hardly anything about why Tobey Maguire is a bit weird is explained to us . This is very annoying as he is the most intriguing character in the film . Although it was cool to see him paired up with Katie Holmes again . Michael Douglas turns in a terrific performance but he is not as good as he was in Falling Down which was definitely his best . But he certainly does come close here . As a writer myself I kind of understood his frustration but his reasons for not writing like he used to just didn't convince me . The photography in this film was superb . Dante Spinotti ( LA Confidential , Heat , The Insider ) creates a very unique and effective atmosphere . The scene outside the house during the party was very impressive . The snow , the silence and the slight wind were all wonderfully captured . This is without a doubt the film's strong point . This is by no means a bad film but it's not a great one either . But no matter what your tastes , you'll never waste your time watching it .
564639	102816	146882	5.0	Talk , talk , talk , talk talk ,	I don't mind movies having cool dialogue in every other scene . Talking about and building plot is important but HIGH FIDELITY has NO plot . It is nothing but talking . There are some cool scenes but it gets very boring very quickly . It was a long 113 minutes let me tell ya . I know what this movie is about . A man growing up years after he should have . But it should have been shorter . All the performances are very good . Especially Jack Black as Barry . It's the biggest role he's had so far after smaller roles in movies like THE JACKEL and MARS ATTACKS . But Tim Robbins steals the show . Rent this movie on DVD and keep it turned down low because the music throughout is outrageously loud .
564236	102816	397042	5.0	Wears thin fast	Six years have passed since the Umbrella Corporation released the T-Virus into the small town of Raccoon City and turned almost the entire population in flesh-eating zombies . Leon Kennedy , one of the survivors has risen from ordinary cop to a special agent in charge of VIP security . When the President's daughter is kidnapped by a deranged evil cult in rural France he must do whatever it takes to get her back . What he discovers is a conspiracy that makes the T-Virus outbreak look like a 70s episode of Blue Peter . For the next several hours you'll run through zillions of different environments blasting as mad villagers and collecting gold . The more gold you collect the better weapons you can buy from the creepy merchant who shows up throughout every level . Yes , it all looks very pretty . But it's increasingly tedious stuff . Let me just say that I loved Resident Evil ( the Gamecube remake ) and I thought that Resident Evil Zero was quite a lot of fun too . While Resident Evil 4 is an improvement in terms of graphics and hardware it doesn't have any atmosphere or the overwhelming sensation of dread and fear . This is basically down to the style of gameplay . Gone are the spooky camera angles for a start . Instead , this time the camera is constantly behind Leon , following him in whatever direction he goes . It's a bit tricky at first but after a few minutes you'll get the hang of it . Also , the game is not really about exploration and mystery solving and you never really go back to the same place twice . Okay , this is a good thing in some ways as it did get a little annoying before ( the ' door-opening ' cut-scenes are also gone ) and I understand the gameplay of the franchise had to evolve but , the way it is , RE 4 just feels like a shoot-em-up . In your long , long journey ( the game is absolutely MASSIVE ) Leon visits a rickety European village that seems stuck in the dark ages , onto an old castle , then to a creepy island and on into a huge fortress and laboratory . In this respect it feels a LOT like a Dungeon Siege game in regards to the constant running around in torch-lit catacombs , killing big insects , collecting treasures , trading / building up your stats and weapons and looking for that way out which seems to be miles away through endless , labyrinthine corridors . All you really do in this game is go forward and shoot . And it gets quite boring after the halfway mark . There is some very slight puzzle-solving but I suspect this was only put in to satisfy hardcore RE fans . And what really gets on my nerves is the stupidness of it all . The RE games are notorious for having extremely convoluted plots but the story in this one will have you tying your brain in knots . And why the hell does Leon battle 20-foot tall ogres ? Is this a Lord of the Rings game ? The realism of the first games is absent and with it goes the sense of gut-wrenching tension . You know this game is just fantasy hokum whereas before the sense that it all could happen is what made the zombies all the more terrifying . A sload of homages and references to other movies are peppered through the game . Try to spot references to Splatterhouse , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , hell ? even Harry Potter . All interesting but still totally inappropriate for an RE game . There are plenty of pros , like the previously mentioned brilliant graphics , the sheer size of the game is impressive , the cool extras and mini-games awarded after finishing ( I did it in 15 hours and I WON'T be going through it again ) and faster loading times . But the boredom of killing the zillionth evil henchman and his twin really gets mind-numbingly dull after hour 10 . I finished this in 6 days ( the original and Zero took me much longer ) so I suggest you rent this if you're not the obsessive RE collector type . While it is a great-looking game and very slick , it just didn't keep me as thrilled ( or as scared ) as it could have . Graphics Absolutely wonderful . The RE games on the Gamecube have always looked brilliant but it's hard to find better looking games than this . The environments and locations are all so vividly detailed it would be scary if the game were not so corny . Sound Again , almost perfect . But I would have had more satisfaction is blowing the heads of freaks off if the gunshots were louder and more dynamic . The musical score comes and goes and it's nothing special but if you've got it hooked up to a home theatre the best thing is hearing those freaks creep up behind you . Extras As with the previous games , the faster you finish the game , the better extras you will unlock . Mini games , special costumes , heavy artillery , hidden treasures and bottle caps are but some of the goodies awaiting you . Final Thoughts I am disappointed that the game doesn't live up to it's predecessors . I understand a 4th in a series must be radically new and different but this feels too far removed from the original games and the outlandish plot connections seem false and forced . A decent shoot-em-up for a once around only . Despite the bonus unlockables , it was too derivative for me to come back . The PS2 version is also available in a metal case .
564155	102816	364725	5.0	Two parts Baseketball , One Part Kingpin	I have never seen a more unoriginal movie in my life . Every single joke , gag or pun in Dodgeball is blatantly and openly stolen from another movie . And this really , really bugs me . However I did laugh constantly and it was enjoyable . Though I must confess my hatred of Ben Stiller and his insistence to crank out 200 unfunny films a year ( a schedule typically reserved for porn stars ) . Initially , I hated Vince Vaughn and liked Stiller . But now that's kind of flip-flopped . After Vaughn's funny performance in Old School I warmed to him but Stiller is under the impression that everything he does is funny . He certainly is not ; anyone can act like a jerk . The plot is old hat . But Vaughn's ragtag group of losers and their determination to win the Dodgeball tournament is the real laugh machine . Though I was constantly thinking about how they worked much better in Baseketball or Kingpin . Asides from Vaughn and the so-not-funny anymore Stiller the cast is good . Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan is amusing ( though he did the exact same role in Summer Rental ) , Stephen Root ( that's Bill Dauterive for all you King of the Hill fans ) was my fave and there's plenty of cameos from the likes of Hank Azaria , Jason Bateman , William Shatner , David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris . Funny it may well be but expect practically every laugh to come with a heavy sense of Déjà vu . I wouldn't bother buying the DVD when it comes out . Just watch Baseketball and Kingpin side by side on 2 TVs and you'll end up watching this . And trust me , if ESPN 8-The Ocho , was a real channel , I'd be watching it every day .
564677	102816	454923	5.0	SNES version is a classic , GBA version is a disgrace	The evil scum of the Bydo Empire are at it again . So it's up to you to climb into your R-9 Ragnarok vessel and blast off to defeat the mutant alien slime . This second sequel ( or third if you count the Japanese Arcade-only R-Type Leo ) was originally just as solid as any other game in the series . This GBA version is tepid to the point of redundancy . The cut-scenes have been omitted so the game is just one level after another . While the graphics look good they have a tacky cheapness about them that is distracting . And don't get me started on the music . The R-Type series is famous for having some of the most coolest of the coolest tunes ever , sort of like a futuristic space-rave . Sadly , in this GBA version they have been cut down to the most horrible sounding and basic midi files . It almost feels like there is no music at all . The gameplay just sucks , plain and simple . Nothing is about skill , instead one must memorise their way around the levels . There is no fun to be had in risk-taking as you will always lose coz the odds are so heavily against you . And too often there are long gaps in which nothing happens , just the ship cruising through empty space . And when you inevitably die you get sent miles back and must do it all over again . Since finishing this near-impossible games requires doing levels over and over again it becomes very repetitive and tedious very quickly . Anyone keen to check out R-Type III ought to get the SNES version and leave this disgrace be . Unless you like game that will make you tear the hair from your head in frustration and bore the pants off you with the dull levels . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564651	102816	190374	5.0	Not as bad as most would have you believe .	While not a masterpiece of any kind ( the film barely exceeds mere competence ) I didn't find D & D to be as bad as the negative reviews claimed . I put off watching it for so long for this reason , but it was enjoyable enough . Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable , so I'm not going to avoid it . I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy . It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you . Yes , they are much , much better made than the rather quaint D & D , but if you want a smaller , unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out . The visual effects and production design of D & D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat . Yes , it looks fake , but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice . I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm . In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic . There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else . The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed . The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious ( maybe a bit too OTT ) sound design . And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film . I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits . I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker . And what's with that ending ? Either way , I am still interested in the sequel .
564441	102816	38259	5.0	More like ' The Woman in Black and White '	A serial killer on the streets of London has Scotland Yard in a panic . Inspector Gregson ( replacing Lestrade , who is obviously not suited to this kind of story ) asks Holmes for help . On the case for only a few minutes , Holmes already makes keen observations and quickly deduces that it all must be the devilish work of Professor Moriarty . . . again . He's already died twice in these movies and another third time before this story is set . It annoys me that he's always so prominently featured in many Sherlock Holmes films when he really was no more than a come-and-go character in Conan-Doyle's stories . Henry Daniell is really bad as Moriarty and comes across as wimpy and effeminate . Not exactly a good approach , this ain't no pantomime . The reason behind the murders is also quite contrived and nonsensical and there's only a little bit of a mysterious atmosphere . A cheap and silly Holmes movie and certainly the lowest point so far for Rathbone and Bruce .
564127	102816	482604	5.0	Generic shooter	In fact , ' generic ' is too fancy a word for this game . It tries to attempt the same sort of atmosphere seen in the recent film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow , with Jules Verne-type technology in a 19th century setting . But it's so dull and uninteresting . You have the choice of playing as biplane or a blimp ( hardly the best kind of combat vehicle ) as you fly through several slightly atmospheric stages blasting at generic enemies and catching generic power-ups . There's almost no skill involved in it at all . And the music is some of the most boring I've ever encountered in a video-game . I can't think of anything to recommend this game . The Gameboy Advance version features slightly improved graphics and altered cut scenes , but would still never ever consider paying full price for this . If you're desperately keen then pay less than half price for the GBA version if you can and ignore the Sega release . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564776	102816	158958	5.0	Not much to do .	All you really do in this game is look around Springfield and run into the occasional character . I finished the entire thing in less than 2 hours . Plus it is not very vivid or deep . You can only visit 2 classrooms in the Springfield elementary school , there is only 1 angle of Moe's bar etc . All you really do is LOOK at these locations that we are already familiar with and have the tiniest little bit of interaction with them . Plus the geography of Springfield in this game is not the same as the TV show . Which is also inconsistent in it's placing of many " sets " . Moe's Bar has been in many different places for example . But , then again , in the HOMER BECOMES a garbageman episode , the town was moved to another site . Perhaps this is where it got all shuffled up . There are a few little ( and I mean little ) games included . One of the main games is to simply find hidden baseball cards . A ploy to trick into clicking on the screen and revealing slight animation . In total there is just under 25 minutes worth of animation here and it is cool that the original cast provided the voices . But unless you are a Die Hard Simpsons fan then I would leave this game be . Definitely only for younger kids .
564478	102816	78187	6.0	Certainly no Castle of Cagliostro	Oh , what a huge difference a director makes . Where Castle of Cagliostro had atmosphere , inventive visuals , coherence and plot Mystery of Mamo has blandness , cheap backgrounds , confusion and silliness . It IS good for a single viewing and features a couple of pretty good action scenes but , I'm afraid , beyond that it's just as forgettable as any other random Japanese cartoon . Lupin III has been cloned and killed and the ever highly-strung Inspector Zenigata rejoices but it turns out that some being from another dimension in the form of a dwarf freak and a huge disembodied brain is behind the whole charade and involves the real , living Lupin III in some cockamamie plot . Don't even think about trying to follow this tripe . There's no charm or appeal to Mystery of Mamo and while there's plenty of visual humor and the characters we love , they deserve a better film . Go watch Castle of Cagliostro instead .
564712	102816	118615	6.0	Snakes are a pain !	It's not in every movie that John Voight gets to impress us with the size of his snake . And it's not often I make bad jokes like that . I apologize . In fact , when I saw this in the cinema , the audience was in fits of laughter at the very first sight of said beast . A National Geographic film crew travel down river to the deepest depths of the Amazon jungle in search of a mythical tribe of large-breasted naked women , or something . On the way , they pick up a hitchhiker whose boat has been wrecked in a storm . Big mistake ! The hitchhiker is Paul Sarone ( John Voight , hamming it up so heavy he's almost sponsored by Danish ) , hell-bent on capturing a 60-foot snake that's lurking in the water . The rest of the crew tries to stand up against him , but his sneer is obviously too scary to fight against . Ice Cube plays the typical homebody from South Central ; Jonathan Hyde is the typical English gent ; Jennifer Lopez is the typical tough babe ; Owen Wilson is a dufus , as always , and Kari Wuhrer - infinitely prettier than Lopez - provides a decent distraction from the hungry reptile . In the tradition of horror-in-the-jungle movies , the victims get knocked off , one by one . Sometimes the anaconda looks real and when it doesn't , the effects are iffy , indeed . The plot works up to a predictable climax , with a big bang , to satisfy the audience . It's hard to believe this film went straight to No . 1 at the US box office . It's simply awful , but has such a hey-ho charm and a who-gives-a-damn attitude that it makes for decent popcorn fare . The script is chockablock full of clichés and most of the laughs are unintentional . But entertainment is entertainment , nevertheless , and Anaconda provides enough of it . How can you refuse a movie that offers a POV shot of inside a snake's belly ? How on earth the producer managed to assemble the actors he did , when the characters are no more than snake fodder , is unreal . They're all capable of better things , that's for sure . If giant fakes - I mean , snakes - turn you on , then go for it . Otherwise , beware . This is a Z-movie with a B-movie cast .
563843	102816	37168	6.0	The Pearl of Blandness	There's not a hell of a lot of mystery or suspense in this Holmes movie , I'm sorry to say . The sets , the characters and the plot are all so generic and ordinary that nothing really stands out . It begins with Holmes successfully recovering a priceless stolen pearl ( wow , what an amazing macguffin ) from a bunch of thieves and returning it to it's rightful owner . But , in a moment of arrogance , he disables the alarm at the museum when he points out the security faults and the pearl is stolen again by some arch-villain who fails to impress and probably wouldn't even say boo to a goose in real life . The usual questions and snooping around follow with Lestrade acting like a moron and Watson bumbling around in the background . I'm grateful that this one doesn't have any silly WWII sentiment in it but , once again , it is clearly filmed on Universal's medieval Europe set which looks and feels absolutely nothing like London . Did you know that I have , so far , not seen Big Ben in any one one of these Rathbone / Bruce movies . Even some stock footage spliced in there would make it just the tiniest bit more authentic . And what's the fascination with Pearls anyway ? It's just a marble made by an oyster .
564516	102816	32455	6.0	Ambitious and well-intentioned , but ultimately a misfire	Fuelled with the noble ambition of bringing classical music to a wider audience , especially children , Fantasia succeeds and fails in equal amounts . Some of it works , some it bores . It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out . The first segment is enough to put you off completely . We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played ( Toccata and Fugue in D Minor ) . Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player . This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques . I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking ' What the hell is this ? ' The three good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring , the over publicised Sorcerer's Apprentice , The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain . All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation . Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos ( The Pastoral Symphony ) or the ' meet the soundtrack ' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all , I'm sorry to say . The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons usually are . But ultimately , Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate . Still worth checking out though .
564428	102816	39252	6.0	Go fish !	Tom sneaks into a secluded area for some fish poaching . The lake is guarded by Spike , but Tom has his same old tricks for taking care of him . In his bait box he has a captured Jerry , who he promptly disguises as a worm and casts into the lake . Some horrible sort of Gator / Fish creature pops up and decides he'd really like to get a bite of Jerry , but he'll be damned if he's gonna let Tom catch him . There are a couple of funny moments in this cartoon but it's mostly just generic stuff and recycled gags . The ending isn't really up to much either , it's all just plain uninspired .
564588	102816	267248	6.0	Worth one viewing only	I liked this movie . It portrayed teenagers and college students in a far more subdued manner than normal and didn't animate any characters to the point of stupidity ( IE Stifler is not in this movie and no one ' does it ' with a dog covered in wedding cake ) . Almost everyone in is disconnected in some way and have feelings that do not show . It's a character driven movie that works thanks to delicate acting and atmospheric direction . I found the strobing scene to be particularly interesting , especially in retrospect now that I know the ( pretty surprising ) plot twist . Katie Holmes , though not remarkable , gives her role enough life to make the movie work but still cannot separate from her Dawson's Creek part . Only as the movie draws to a close does she really provoke any emotion from the audience . It's a difficult character to play but she just about makes it . The script is pretty weak but it's delivered in a deliberately empty way . We almost feel abandoned watching it . The movie is sparsely populated and makes us feel alone . It creates an interesting atmosphere that is the movie's saving grace . Without this edge it would be a waste of time . It's worth a rent , but only for viewing alone . The DVD has Audio commentary by Director / Writer Stephan Gaghan and Cinematographer Matthew Libatique , brief documentary , Deleted scenes with Director's commentary and a trailer . It is presented in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and is in Dolby 5 . 1 .
564607	102816	30070	6.0	Little horrors	While enjoying a calm , stress-free day , Donald is sent a postcard from his sister Dumbella , saying that her sons Huey , Duey and Louie will be coming to stay for a while . Now these are not the well behaved kids from Duck Tales that you might be used to . No , they are little rapscallions who proceed to do nothing but lay waste to Donald's house . Donald desperately tries to keep them under control and even consults a child psychiatry book in a futile attempt to maintain order . It doesn't work and only inspires them to torment him further . This cartoon is proof that Donald's sole purpose in his existence is to live it in a state of perpetual rage .
564310	102816	109327	6.0	A strange , curious little movie	I liked Brainscan when I was younger but it seems a bit dated now , even for a film made in 1994 . It just makes such a big deal out of CD-ROM technology . I guess the only game out back then was Myst . Michael Brower ( Furlong ) is a lonely kid . His mother is dead and his dad is often away on long business trips leaving him alone in his attic bedroom with his massive computer station big enough to be the Skynet system core ( one presumes his dad is computer salesman or something ) . Horror movies are his obsession and spying on his would-be girlfriend next door breaks up the day . For him , life is easier when seen through a TV rather than dealing with it up front . His attention is drawn to an ad in Fangoria , a video game called Brainscan which promises the ultimate high in interactive gaming . It's a horror game that is so real it'll chill your blood etc etc . Michael is sceptical but goes along with it anyway . He dials the number and gets his ( apparently free ) Brainscan disc . The object of the game is to kill and that's exactly what Michael does . He's sent into a state of deep hypnosis through the TV and wakes up on his ultimate killing high . So THIS is what it feels like to be Jason Voorhees ! Trouble is it appears that Michael really is killing people and when he tries to shut the game down wonderfully mad character called The Trickster pops out of the TV and involves himself in conversations regarding the nature of horror that become a bit too philosophical . Brainscan ends with a plot twist that is quite ingenious and caught me totally off-guard the first time I saw it . However , a couple of plot points that occur after this make no sense and throw the whole logic of the plot into confusion . Written by Andrew Kevin Walker ( the very man who gave us Se7en and 8mm ) you can expect there to be a certain tightness to the structure of the film but it seems to be to small and restricted for it's own good . If more opportunities created by the bizarre story were explored and fleshed out it could have been a great film instead of only being a good one . The Brainscan DVD is in average looking 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with average Dolby 2 . 0 sound . The region 1 disc is really the only way to go as the Region 2 is in crappy fullscreen . Neither have any features . Don't pay more than 5 bucks this if you really want it .
564385	102816	27963	6.0	Ugly humans .	I've never seen humans drawn so ugly . Not so much the Polo players like Laurel and Hardy ( I always like them ) but more the spectators in the audience . I don't know who that huge-headed , bulbous-eyed guy was supposed to be but he freaked me out . Anyways , it's Disney stars vs Real Actors in this Polo match ( A rather odd choice of sport . Was it popular in the ' 30s ? ) and nothing really funny happens . Sure there are a couple of clever moments but , like far too many Disney toons , it's all a set-up for everything to come crashing down . Vividly animated as it may be , it's still a bit too boring and doesn't hold up against Looney Tunes when it comes to hijinks .
563935	102816	43128	6.0	Not many laughs	In this short , Bugs tells the story of his life from the day he was born right up until his discovery in Hollywood and subsequent stardom . It isn't really funny as Bugs doesn't have anyone to work with for most of the cartoon . There are a couple of scenes with Elmer Fudd but he doesn't do or say much . And the running joke with the chorus dancers in the tuxedos wasn't all that amusing . I was also a bit annoyed at the end because not only is it not funny but it isn't true . I've seen better Bugs cartoons than this . Though I must say the title song is very cool ( used in many of ' Rabbit / Duck season ' cartoons with Bugs , Daffy and Elmer ) . It just seems weird using it without having Daffy anywhere in sight .
564442	102816	38008	6.0	Sea-through mystery .	Pursuit to Algiers is unfortunately void of any kind of mystery . The villains and their intentions are made clear to the characters and audience very early on so there's no puzzle or clues for Holmes to work with . The opening is quite well done , however , with Holmes being secretly led to a meeting with foreign officials . His mission is to escort a would-be King back to his native Romanovajebrovia or whatever . But there is a bunch of assassins after him making the chore somewhat difficult . Why Sherlock Holmes , a detective , is hired to do the job of a Secret Agent is a little weird , but it does set up a potentially interesting story as Holmes and Watson board a cruise ship with a bunch of shady characters watching their every move . There's not much atmosphere to be had , but some of the fog-bound deck scenes are effective . The only thing this entry seems to have going for it is a surprising twist ending with the credits following rather abruptly . Still worth investing your time in though .
564673	102816	469194	6.0	Fun , but pointless	Despite the beautiful graphics and multiple characters to choose from ( including several from Final Fight ) I just can't see any REAL difference between this and the endless other 1-on-1 beat-em-ups out there . I never really mastered all of the special moves but there weren't needed as fighting with simple punches and kicks was good enough . It's fun for a while but in no way a game I would spend ages playing and finishing as every last character . I'm not that sad and I've got better things to do with my time . Graphics A Sound B Gameplay B Lasting Appeal
564084	102816	62127	6.0	Thumbing it	The Pink Panther is ambitious enough to attempt to hitchhike his way to Anaheim , California despite the fact that it's over 1500 . The reason why he wants to go there is never explained and he's not having much luck finding sympathetic drivers willing to take him this massive distance . A nearby horse laughs at him , so Pinky has the brilliant idea of riding the horse all the way . But the horsey is having none of it and the rest of the cartoon is made up of Pinky's various attempts at mounting it . A thin excuse for some slight gags . One of them involves Pinky falling off a cliff and landing in a puff of smoke like Wile E . Coyote ( director Hawley Pratt was involved in several RoadRunner cartoons ) . But the very end in which the horse gets the very last laugh makes up for the rest of the tedium .
564026	102816	58150	6.0	Cheap-ass , simplistic Bond bore .	I know I'm just asking to be hauled over the coals for this , but Goldfinger is surely one of the dullest Bond films . I am not some cheeseburger junkie brought up on Die Another Day and xXx , before you make that assumption . But I found Goldfinger to be tolerable only because it was rather short for a Bond film and had a villain who was somewhat likable instead of a despicable super-arch-nemesis living in a volcano lair . Despite the fact that this film apparently cost more to make then the first two Bond films combined it is so amazingly cheap you could be fooled into thinking it they filmed it all for free . First of all , Sean Connery is obviously never outside of Pinewood Studios ( or the nearby , surrounding countryside ) since every time he appears ' on location ' it's ridiculously fake-looking rear-projection . My God , if you're going to make a spy movie in a franchise that sells itself on globe-trotting how about actually having your actor BE there ! The locations , as a result , are all low-key and not much to look at . The gold-melting plant in Geneva , for example , is blatantly an anonymous alleyway out the back of Pinewood . I was never really one for the silly gadget's in Bond film's either , so I'm glad that they never played a big part in the story and the stuff that he did use ( homing devices ) were believable . But don't get me started about the car ! Why , why , why do people always cream their panties over these inane Bond cars ? Let me tell you something ; the Aston Martin is lamest thing I have ever seen , I wouldn't be seen dead in one and it irritates the hell out of me that they keep cropping up in this series . And that's even WITH Q's cunning extras . The Goldfinger Aston Martin spawned a die-cast toy car that's worth zillions on E-Bay these days and is worth even more if you have the box ( why would you ) with the ejector seat still intact . Wow . . . the ejector seat . Such a big deal is made out of this but I swear the guy Bond launches out of his car soars a whopping one foot in the air . Adventure doesn't get any bigger than THAT huh ? Despite it's undeserved praise as a classic and a definitive Bond film , Goldfinger is clearly a rush-job with an Oddjob . This was Connery's third Bond film ( as well as others ) in two years . If they took a little more time and effort and delivered something with more sophisticated framing and effects then Goldfinger could have been worthy of being called a classic . As it is it's merely a fond childhood event for a lot of older adults who are unable to see how naff it is since they can only view it through nostalgic goggles .
563807	102816	106429	6.0	Better than average TV fare	Most TV movies I've seen are abysmal . But this one manages to rise above than with some okay photography and a really cool musical score by David Michael Frank ( whatever became of him ? ) . Jeff Fahey is quite good at playing Frank , a crooked cop who is hiding out from the bad guys who blinded him in Mexico . There he meets Mia Sara who plays Chandler Strange and he becomes involved in a schemey sub-plot . Things turn against him as events arise suspicion . This TV movie has it's roots in low-key gangster movies and sticks to them like glue . By doing this the whole movie feels authentic and atmospheric . Which is not something you see all the time in TV movies . Overall
564840	102816	99864	6.0	Stripped down , but still stands well on ITs own .	I've never read the book of IT , but I did buy it for my mother's 30th birthday some years ago . She never took much interest so I had a browse myself . While not reading it cover to cover I did read about 100 pages in the middle section of the book just to see if it bore any resemblance to the TV-movie . Yes it does and no is doesn't . If that makes any sense . The characters are there and King's ever-recurring Derry is portrayed effectively enough as a dead-end , horrible town . But like most screen adaptations , it lacks the heavy substance of King's writing . But it would be hard to squeeze in over 1000 pages of story into a movie , even if it is 3 hours long . Split into two halves , the movie begins with the disappearance of a little girl , taken by an evil clown named Pennywise ( a deeply sinister Tim Curry ) . A local librarian recognizes the pattern of the murders and calls each of his friends ( The Lucky Seven / Losers Club ) who helped defeat Pennywise 30 years previously . Pennywise is not bound by the laws of physics and takes on the form of what each of the lucky seven are most afraid of . They find no other appropriate word to describe the phenomena other than IT . We see the backstory to each of them as they suddenly remember events they have mysteriously forgotten . A simple plot device , but effective . It makes the first half stronger than the second . From the 90-minute mark onwards we have a bunch of scared grown-ups who just seem to ask ' What are we going to do ? ' about a zillion times even though as kids they knew exactly what they were doing and were a lot tougher . The ultimate ending is a bit of a let down as it totally erases King's mythology and gives us some lame monster that is nothing compared to Pennywise himself . A helluva lot of King's mystery is simply torn out but IT still has enough energy and intrigue to make a decent stand-alone movie . But after 3 hours , I just wanted a better ending . Director Tommy Lee Wallace did want to shoot in Panavision ( an unusual move for a TV movie ) but the studio wouldn't allow him and so he compromised by shooting in flat 1 . 85 : 1 ( still irregular for 1990 ) . It would have been better to have a scope aspect ratio , especially with 7 characters sometimes occupying the screen at once . But you can blame studio interference for that . An above average TV movie , no doubt . Just loses momentum after the half-way mark and loses points for not sticking closer to King's book .
563944	102816	781425	6.0	Only a couple of good moments	I only watched this because of Naomi St . James , who is one of the most gorgeous porn actresses ever , but her scene wasn't that good . It was just plain sex with a tiny bit of badly done anal at the end and then a weak cumshot . The only good bit is at the end when Donna Warner gets a DP and Patty Rouge enters to be DP'd also but then gets an anal fisting from Donna . THAT was pretty damn cool , but the rest in mundane . If they were going be extreme then why not all the way through instead of just one bit at the end . Give it a go if you come by it , but only if it's cheap .
564286	102816	33952	6.0	Nothing special	Outside of a cozy Xmas atmosphere and the look and feel of a lovely country Xmas , this Tom and Jerry cartoon doesn't have much going for it outside of the usual hijinks . Jerry wanders around late on Xmas Eve , nosing at all the presents . House guardian Tom , doing his duty , chases him . It ends up with Jerry being booted out into the freezing cold . Feeling guilty , Tom eventually goes out to rescue him and the two of them enjoy the warmth of the fire together . Like I said , it's nothing special and not very inventive at all . A good cartoon to view at Xmastime however .
564795	102816	251075	6.0	Just plain fun	It's clear that as long as Ivan Reitman works in sci-fi comedy he will never achieve the greatness he did with Ghostbusters . That movie was a masterpiece of genius . Evolution is nothing but a fun ride that comes nowhere near the class of Ghostbusters . But it's still well worth it . Weird really when you consider that Ghostbusters : Go to Hell , the second sequel in which hell got so full that spirits started spilling out into the real world , was re-written and redrafted that it became this . . . something completely different . You probably know the story . A meteor crash lands in the desert and the single celled organisms living on it very , very quickly become multi celled and then little worm creatures and then . . . many other things . The movie repeatedly calls them aliens but since they evolve from nothing on earth and are conditioned by earth's environment they are , effectively , earth creatures . Watching them run riot and cause havoc is the main fun of this film . Ghostbusters had a dry , sarcastic sense of humor , like a fine wine . Evolution has a crude , gross-out sense of humor like American Pie , which seriously lessens the overall quality of the film . The lead trio of actors perform rather well together . Duchovny is much looser and easy-going here than his stiff , X-Files character . Seann William-Scott once again plays a dufus but he's more endearing here than he has been in other roles . Orlando Jones is kind of good but he too often takes his role in the stereotyped ' only black guy in a white movie ' direction . Sadly though , Julianne Moore's accident-prone scientist just isn't funny and her clumsiness seems false and forced . But obviously when you judge Evolution next to something better it seems an inferior movie . Judge it on it's own terms and you'll definitely enjoy . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen ( though it really could have benefited from a scope 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio ) and is in rather lacklustre Dolby 5 . 1
564551	102816	365748	6.0	Not really THAT great .	It's time for a serious , level-headed review of Shaun of the Dead . This movie is one of the most over-hyped of the year . I'm tired of everyone calling it an instant cult classic . This phrase doesn't make any sense . A cult classic is a film that no one sees by has a small but loyal following . Shaun of the Dead was a big hit when it was released her back in April and it seems like it will do the same when it's released in America thanks to the alarmingly widespread positive word-of-mouth . Everyone seems to be caught up in the off-centre comedy to realize that the film is heavily conflicted and doesn't add up . First of all , this is not a romzomcom , or whatever . There is no romance , just a guy who wants to make up with his girlfriend while zombies get in the way . And to call it a comedy would be totally wrong , anyone paying the slightest iota of attention would see this film is not a comedy ! Some funny moments , yes . But not all the way . Like most other zombie flicks there is no explanation to why Britain is suddenly overrun by the undead . The plague slowly trickles to life from the odd zombie stumbling around to full-blown hoards of them . Amidst this Shaun ( Simon Pegg ) and Ed ( the great Nick Frost ) make fun of the undead and go about dealing with the holocaust in their own silly way . There are some pretty hard scenes of heavy emotion is this film ( I want say what , but some characters do die ) that totally contradict the ' comedy ' label it's been stuck with . And despite some scenes of graphic violence this is NOT a horror film . It's not a comedy , a romantic comedy a spoof or homage . It simply doesn't know what it is . Many people believe they got a breath of fresh ( or should that be old ) air when it was revealed the film would have slow zombies and not the faster ones like in DOTD 2004 and ( the dreadful ) 28 Days Later . I personally do not understand this overused moan . Slow zombies are not scary ; there is no threat from them . Shaun of the Dead starts out very stupid and slow . The opening scenes of people doing the repetitive things day in day out are not subtle at all and hammer the point to the audience way too forcefully . Then when the zombies first appear the characters and the audience don't fully realize / appreciate the danger until the last five minutes when the film finally becomes exciting and then that's when we get REALLY ripped off . The film ends way too quickly and conveniently . What a let down after building up so much only to collapse back into the stupid tone the film began in . Horror buffs will like the zillions of in-jokes and references to other horror movies . To the casual viewer , they will go right over your head . It's about the only thing that's consistent throughout the whole film . Don't listen to the word of over-excited reviewers who are inexplicably giving this film 5 stars . It is in no way the classic they are making it out to be . Good , yes . Entertaining , yes . The best movie you've ever seen / best zombie movie ever / yadda yadda yadda , definitely not . Shaun of the Dead has great potential come from inspiring sources , but the end result is not what the hype is telling you . Already out in UK , the DVD has great 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5 . 1 sound and zillions of extras including Audio commentary from actor / writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright , Audio commentary from actors Simon Pegg , Nick Frost , Dylan Moran , Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis .

After several failed attempts at getting a girl , including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals David Brents ' fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in The Office ( Disco's dead ? , says Jon ) , he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself . Naturally , they get on but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat . Fortunately Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats . With slicker animation than past TV specials , this feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends .
564203	102816	85936	7.0	No acid rain , drug addiction , international terrorism or freeway killers in this one	Scrooge McDuck rather fittingly plays Ebeneezer Scrooge in this Disney version of a story that TV writers have been milking for years . To me , the only good movies based on Charles Dickens ' classic novel are this one , Scrooged and Muppet's Christmas Carol . Though I do remember seeing something as a kid called The Stingiest Man in Town that was very similar . Or did I dream that ? As usual with Disney animation , this 25-minute short is wonderfully detailed and cosy . But I feel that it may not have as much lasting power other feature length movies . It's just not long enough . The story feels very rushed but it's no less effective . Originally produced to precede the re-release of The Rescuers in 1983 I reckon that Mickey's Christmas Carol is a classic in it's own way , even if it only familiar to Disney fans instead of the average kid who has been raised on Toy Story and Dinosaur . I do believe that it could have been a feature length film but as a big fan of Scrooge McDuck I can just turn to Duck Tales if I want more of him . This was also his second screen appearance after appearing in a Donald Duck short years before . He's an underrated Disney character and deserves a comeback .
564484	102816	250198	7.0	Not exactly a Cancun booze-fest	Back when having a car was about as rare as three-legged ballet dancer Indy aims to impress everyone at school by turning up to the prom in a Bugatti race-car and put tormentor Butch to shame . His girlfriend's dad is Edward Stratemayer ( the guy who created the Hardy Boys , Nancy Drew and Tom Swift ) and promises to loan him the Bugatti until the engine fails . Desperate to get it fixed in time Indy takes it to Edison Industries to have the guys in the science lab fit a new electric battery into it . But since the oil company's are such a fiendish bunch they steal the plans for the battery and trash the lab , leaving Indy to rescue them on his own if he wants to make an impression at the prom . In the second half Indy travels to Mexico with his cousin to have a good time in a whorehouse but he is kidnapped by a bunch of Mexican Revolutionaries and pressured into fighting for their cause . He gets to meet Pancho Villa , trash William Randolph Hearst's mansion south of the border and antagonize General Patton . In the end he just wants to go home but not before getting revenge on Demetrius , the baddie who eluded him six years earlier in Egypt . A solid adventure with a good cast , though it's weird seeing Lloyd Owen still play the Connery role since his is one year YOUNGER than Flannery who plays his son . It works though . . . somehow .
563816	102816	36294	7.0	Oh , what to do .	If there is anyone out there who read the comic book ' Beezer ' as a kid then you will be familiar with ' The Knumbskulls ' . A strip about a guy with little dudes living in him that control what he does . This short uses the same device to make an important , kind of subtle , point to us . Some guy , starting out as a baby , sometimes follows his emotions and at other times sense . Just like everyone else . He sees a woman he likes on the street and follows his emotions . It ends up a slap in the face , but her common sense reacted , not her emotions , which said ' yes ' . The point of this is that Hitler used emotions to keep the Nazi's brainwashed . None of them used common sense to figure out that he was a lunatic . But perhaps today we should still use our common sense to not believe rubbish published in tabloids or biased news stations . The logic applies to many things , not just Hitler's Nazi regime .
564457	102816	37929	7.0	Bright Mice , Big Kitty	This cartoon has T & J living a quiet life out in a cosy country cottage . Tom is bored with country life and decides to leave for the Big Apple one night . Writing a goodbye note to Tom , he catches the next train to his new , exciting life . When he gets there he discovers that Manhattan is not so inviting to small rodents . Everywhere he goes , from Grand Central to posh dinner parties , he is tormented with the rude idiosyncrasies of big city life . Eventually landing in a dirty alley , he is run out of town by an army of hungry stray cats . Back the cottage , the still sleeping Tom ( who does nothing else in this cartoon ) has not yet read the note , which Jerry promptly tears up before going back into his mouse-hole . Better the Devil you know huh ?
564227	102816	31242	7.0	Ch ch ch ah ah ah	No Jason Voorhees is not out to kill Donald but it IS Friday the 13th and Donald is a messenger-boy who must deliver a suspicious package to number 13 on 13th street . Inside the package is a bomb set to go off at midnight by a couple of unseen thugs . Who they are and why they want to blow up someone else is never know . What this cartoon focuses on is Donald's conflict with a black cat who has crossed his path . Yes , you can pretty much figure out that Donald is going to lose his tempter and go mad , delaying delivery of the package and risk blowing himself to smithereens . But the color pallet of this short is dark and noir-ish and is a welcome difference from the usual sunny atmospheres Donald finds himself in . A better than average Donald Duck cartoon .
564694	102816	29188	7.0	One of the better Mickey shorts	In this short , Mickey is performing magic tricks on stage while Goofy does all the behind the scenes work , even though all of Mickey's tricks seem to be for real . But Donald , as usual , isn't convinced and causes a fuss with his loud sarcasm and shouting . Mickey quickly silences him by using his magic . Donald becomes part of the act and is humiliated in various ways . It's actually quite imaginative and much better than the usual Mickey cartoons . If only Mickey ( who only has one line here ) consistently kept to this high standard . He really needs Donald to make him funnier than he is and it's pretty obvious in this cartoon that the laughs come from angry Duck .
564099	102816	259685	7.0	Lighthearted , silly fun	I really wasn't expecting much from a third in the series even tho Tremors 2 added so much more imagination . So I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be so much fun . It begins with a rather cool opening scene in which Burt Gummer ( still in Mexico ) takes out zillions of Shriekers with a massive machine-gun tank thing . After returning home to Perfection Burt must deal with new graboids , new shriekers and another metamorphosis . . . The shriekers turn into Ass-Blasters , flying creatures with rocket propelled farts . As the town ( and the returning , surviving cast from the first film ) is besieged by all forms of these animals , Burt and his pals must figure out increasing desperate ways to destroy them . There's loads of energy and self-referential humor and the locations have a more dark / sophisticated look to them than in the previous 2 films . A light-hearted tone is still in check tho . There's even one teriffic scene in which Burt is swallowed by a Graboid and taken halfway across the desert . I paniced , I honestly thot we'd lost him . Turns out he's okay in the end . Fred Ward is definitely missed tho his abscence is explained ( Earl and Grady went to make a Graboid amusement park ) but Michael Gross is simply irreplaceable as the eccentric and paranoid Burt Gummer . And Ariana Richards is so much more cuter now that she's grown up . Tremors 3 is the best presented Tremors movie on DVD . The 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5 . 1 is reasonably lively with lots of bass during the tunnelling scenes . A fair amount of extras come along too .
564374	102816	139414	7.0	Mindless fun	Take away the beginning and end credits and what you are left with is a 75-minute long movie that you'll never watch more than once if you buy the DVD ( like me ) but will still have a fun time watching . Steve Miner returns to the tranquil lakeside settings he captured so well in the Friday the 13th movies and gives us more horror hokum . What I liked about Lake Placid is that it is kind of light-hearted and doesn't try and make itself a full-blown horror by showing us guts and entrails . The movie is NOT serious and has many suspenseful scenes packed into it's VERY brief running time . The cast are delightful and the big nasty croc is actually quite sympathetic at the end . Buy this DVD and enjoy for what it is . . . a light , breezy comedy-thriller that nails the bullseye instead of aiming for higher ( and ultimately lesser ) results . Fox may well re-release this movie on DVD with an anamorphic picture and DTS sound . When they do that I suggest you buy . You will like . Trust me .
564435	102816	38740	7.0	Who has custard pies anyway ?	Jerry wakes from a nightmare by a knock at the door only to discover he's been made a surrogate daddy to a baby mouse called Tuffy . The attached note claims that Tuffy loves milk and Jerry must find a way to get him some . Tom has a big bowl full of it , but they'd only be asking for trouble if they were to go steal . The chase begins and it is rather funny , if a bit generic . I did notice moment of weird editing in a certain scene , but later found out that the version I saw was censored by the PC Police for containing a scene where Jerry and Tuffy disguise themselves as African Americans . I would say ' black men ' but they ARE mouses . I do wish the overzealous censors would leave these harmless cartoons alone . This gripe aside , it was entertaining nonetheless . But the crappy custard pie jokes are beneath Tom and Jerry standards !
564407	102816	430912	7.0	A rehash , but an entertaining rehash	A sequel that comes traipsing in 14 years after the original can be accused of cashing-in . But you shouldn't judge a film until you've seen it right ? Yes , I know I am being a total hypocrite here . And if Basic Instinct 2 were to be accepted as a potentially good movie then perhaps they should have done it back in the late 90s when David Cronenberg was involved . Think of the movie he would have made ! But , Hollywood being that grinding , pounding machine that it is , postponed this film until 2006 . Verhoeven , Cronenberg , Jan De Bont and even John McTiernan all came and went . Lead actors such as Michael Douglas , Benjamin Bratt , Kurt Russell , Robert Downey Jr and Pierce Brosnan all passed . As the years passed , the film shifted from America to London and underdog director Michael Caton-Jones took charge . The lead went to David Morrissey , who I have never heard of and a supporting cast of recognisable British faces filled out the rest of the characters . But after all this . . . is all this teasing and sexual depravity still relevant ? A lot has changed in 14 years . We no longer need to walk away from newsagents ashamed for buying a jizz mag because so much better stuff is easy available for free on the internet . And I know where to find the best stuff ! Softcore porn is almost extinct and TV has become racier and more hedonistic . A film selling itself on sex would have to be more than just competent in the story and character department . If this is what matters to you I am afraid that Basic Instinct 2 is pretty much the exact same as the original with the same character arcs and developments . The new location and a fresh crop of characters to kill is really all it's got to offer . This time around Catherine Tramell is causing havoc in the streets of London and ' accidently ' causes the death of a famous football star by driving her car into the Thames . She's not sorry and shows no sympathy . Sent for a psych evaluation she meets Dr . Michael Glass who convinces the judge she has a ' risk addiction ' and will not stop pushing the limits to her madness until it costs her her own life . Glass must be a convincing man as Tramell is soon scot-free to do more evil deeds . And Glass , despite being as reserved and collected as a man can possibly be , like Nick Curran before him , falls head first into a wildly complex plot that bears more than just a shadow of a resemblance to the first . But this time we go a little bit deeper into the devious mind of Catherine Tramell . As a writer myself ( simultaneously really crap and unbelievably brilliant ) I really dig her style . She lies and deceives and manipulates people in diabolically genius ways for her own inspiration . She hides it from everyone but when you look in her eyes you can see the fire of a brilliantly evil mind blazing away . She's a great character and Stone pulls it off perfectly . She may be pushing 50 but she's still gorgeous and in my opinion she looks better in this than she did in the first . What Basic Instinct 2 lacks is a defining set-piece or action scene . It's most all talk and has none of the car chases or panic the original had . Michael Caton-Jones , who's career in film has been extremely unbalanced brings a slick edge to movie and makes it a bit darker than Verhoeven's approach . The world of Basic Instinct 2 is set in a London filled with shining glass and steel surfaces by day and dark shadows by night . Jerry Goldsmith was set to score the film but due to his untimely death the duties were passed onto John Murphy . But worry not , all of Goldsmith's wonderful themes return and although Murphy tries to make it his own by adding his own developments , almost every cue still belongs to Jerry . It's a great score and one of those that stays in your head forever . It's easy to criticize Basic Instinct 2 . It's easy to call it loads of names . But the first film suffered from this exact same problem , but the audiences of today are just far more savage and unforgiving . See past these problems and , like before , you'll discover a film that the rest of the world seems to be missing .
563821	102816	316654	8.0	Big Improvement	It's no secret that I absolutely hated the first film . But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement , pathos and humor . Almost every area where the first film lagged in improved upon . Though I'm still not keen on Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker ( not tall enough , too much of a geek ) he was better in the role this time around . Though I'm not sure why he's still a total nerd . This is not how Peter Parker is portrayed in the comic books and it's weird that in the movie he comes across more like Clark Kent . The CGI effects are miles better too . Some shots still looked a little iffy , but rest was so seamless I never noticed . Granted , it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were . A lot more time and care as been put into arranging them than before . Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a hundred what Willem Dafoe's campy , power-ranger Green Goblin was . You could tell that underneath he really was a good guy who was just too carried away with his work . He really did have a menacing presence in any scene featuring him with his extra arms ( surely more resembling a spider Peter Parker ) . The earthquakes signaling his approach are very cool . The sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set-pieces . The first one felt like an empty showcase for effects but here they were integral to the story . I'm not keen on Kirsten Dunst though ( she looks far too much like my ex ) . In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman . I just don't see that in Kirsten Dunst . However , she really did get into the character and I believed in her relationship with Peter this time as before it felt like rejected sub-Dawson's Creek trash . Spiderman 2 is also made in widescreen , which is cool as I was disappointed at Sam Raimi's inexplicably shooting the original ' flat ' . A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before . Considering how the movie has already earned $40 kabillion in 3 weeks you hardly need me to tell you to go out and see it . But for once the box office receipts are validated by a good movie . Look out for some funny in-jokes to Evil Dead and Bruce Campbell in a funny cameo as an obnoxious theatre usher .
564719	102816	118571	8.0	Brilliantly done action	It's easy to understand why Airforce One was such a big hit . The President saves the country . America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from those no good filthy Reds again . Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts ( fuelled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score ) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President . But the film is very good in it's own right too . Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension , Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary . The film is also very well put together technically . The editing and sound is top-notch . But there are flaws . And one BIG flaw . Some of the dialogue really sucks . And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady . The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady . Her role is totally useless . I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it . I am not kidding . Even Oldman at one point tells her to ' SHUT UP ! ' I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have . If you can overlook this minor , although highly irritating , glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many , increasingly exciting , set-pieces . Very cool .
563852	102816	260264	8.0	Junkie ?	Is it just me or is Pac-Man a metaphor for taking too many ecstasy pills ? Think about it , you've got some happy little face stumbling around in the dark munching as many pills as he can get but when things go bad he's chased by ghosts all over the place until he can get more pills . Either this is really subliminal subtext by designer Toru Iwatani or it's just an amazing coincidence and I'm reading far too much into it . Either way Pac-Man is like THE biggest ever arcade game , which is quite amazing since many more advanced and technologically superior games came out after this . And it has one funky little theme tune !
564460	102816	70328	8.0	Positively surreal Blaxploitation Bond	And none the worse for it , since every Bond film needs a fresh spin on the same old formula . Roger Moore's first outing as JB is , in equal measures , comical and action-packed . You'll never get bored . But it's definitely the weirdest Bond ever with loads of utterly bizarre moments . It begins with M turning up at JB's house in the early hours while he's pumping some Italian agent for information ( don't you just love his initialled dressing gown ) . Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from Q-Branch , including a very useful watch . Q himself , or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name , doesn't make any appearance in this one . Standing out like a Muslim in an airport , almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big's payroll . And they've got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him . The funny thing about Moore is that he's very proper and British and doesn't think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh . His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny . The action then moves to Lousiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot . There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J . W . Pepper , the most stereotypical southern redneck ever . Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea . JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do , many times over , Solitaire , Mister Big's Tarot card reader . I'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee , a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie . Right ? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly . Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away . When will they learn ? Despite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond ( at 46 ) , Moore does look younger than Connery . And while Sean was gruff and Scottish , Moore is perpetually calm and refined , even in the face of danger ( fingers being chopped-off , snake in the bath , being eaten by gators / sharks ) . Everything that the British once thought they were . He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked . While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise , Moore has always been my favorite . And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual , wimpy as hell , Walther PPK . And , as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney , you gotta love that theme song ! Exciting and iconic at the same time . And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever . MI6 , Harlem , Pimps , Paul McCartney , Gators , Heroin , Voodoo , Snakes , Sharks , Clairvoyance , Rednecks , Afros , Fake Afros , Fillet of Soul , Human Scarifice , Scarecrows and a small-headed man in a Top-Hat who lost a fight with chickens . Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane ?
564839	102816	39251	8.0	Encore !	In a departure from the usual household mayhem , Tom stars as a classical concert pianist . Dressed in a tailcoat and hammering out Hungarian Rhapsody Number 2 ( which you might recognize as the tune played by Daffy and Donald in Who Framed Roger Rabbit ) he is bothered by Jerry , who just happens to live inside the piano . Cue loads of tricks played on poor Tom , who is desperately managing to stay in tune as Jerry runs amok . This cartoon actually won an Academy Award back in the day and it's easy to see why . The editing and timing are dead on , as is the imagination . A lot of laughs to be had here and one of the best Tom and Jerry shorts .
564770	102816	45315	8.0	Big hairy monster	Bugs sleeps through a flood and is washed out of his Rabbit hole , down the river and floats by a spooky old castle . Unfortunately for him , said castle is the , not so subtle , residence of a mad scientist who needs a brain to put in his new robot . He chooses Bugs as that brain , but Bugs is having none of it . His escape is made difficult by the unleashing of that big , orange furball thing . How cute is it really ? Bugs pretends to be a camp hairdresser and fancy up Things hair . But uses sticks of TNT instead of curlers . Mere seconds later Thing has quit after Bugs shrinks him down to the size of a mouse using a magic potion . After breaking a ether potion both Bugs and the Mad Scientist go on a trippy chase that results in Bugs falling asleep and being washed away in the river again . He wakes up in his hole believing it all to be a dream . But the little Thing sez otherwise . An above average Bugs cartoon with the always lovable Thing .
563836	102816	37794	8.0	The Great House Detective	After a double homicide involving a gentleman's club , Holmes and Watson are dispatched to a spooky castle on the west coast of Scotland to investigate . It appears that the victims were delivered five orange pips while at dinner with the rest of them before they met their untimely deaths . Already disbelieving the story , Holmes is viewing them all with suspicion as soon as he arrives . Like a typical Friday the 13th film , the bodies start piling up in increasing gruesome fashion and the culprit is narrowed down . But Holmes still ain't convinced and secretly builds his own theories and tactics . Again , House of Fear has the best kind of mystery atmosphere . I love the dark and spooky Scottish castle with the ever-howling wind and labyrinthine structure . I'd love to own a house like that . Watson comes across as a bit more buffoonish than usual but he still entertains . And despite reading the Adventure of the Five Orange Pips a few years ago I was still surprised by the twist ending . One of the best Rathbone / Bruce movies .
564304	102816	119349	8.0	Great film about relationships and character	From this excellent movie . Ang Lee perfectly and convincingly captures the look and feel of two dysfunctional families in 1970s rural America . The acting is so good that in some scenes you cringe when ignorant characters make fools of themselves . The film is split right down the middle . First of all we have the story lines of the two affairing families and second of all there's the story of their children's ' relationships with each other . Although Tobey Maguire does the voice-over on this film he is not really in it much but his scenes add some light-relief to a movie that is otherwise dark in tone . The only ( tiny , little ) gripe I have is that you never find out why Sandy Carver is a little strange . Or maybe you do and I'm just not concentrating enough . See this movie the next time you get a chance and it'll change your opinion of all those souless blockbusters out there that give you only visual effects rather than a real story .
564830	102816	144120	8.0	Well hello Dolly !	After being stuck in an evidence locker for 2 years , Chucky is freed by corrupt cop Bailey , sent by his girlfriend Tiffany . Officer Bailey is quickly offed and Chucky is taken home . He's in quite a state , but then so would you be if you were diced in a giant fan . Using bits off her massive doll collection Tiffany manages to bring Chucky back to life using another chant to the mighty Damballa . As soon as he's on his feet Chucky does yet another killing to get the circulation going . Tiffany is excited and can't wait to get Chucky into a human body so they can get hitched . But Chuck is dead against marriage and laughs in her face . Dejected , Tiffany locks him in a play pen while she blows off some steam . Not taking kindly to being locked up , Chucky breaks out and kills her by knocking a TV into her bathtub . Another chant to Damballa brings her back in the form of one of her many dolls . Angry with the loss of her nice , fleshy body and being stuck in a short , plastic one , Tiffany starts researching ways to help herself without Chucky's aid . Tough luck , the only way out is with the help of an amulet that was buried with Chucky's human body years ago . Conning a couple of local lovebirds , hick Jesse and well-to-do Jade , into driving them to the graveyard in New Jersey , Chuck and Tiff begin a cross-country killing spree , leaving a pile of dead bodies in their wake that the cops assume are the work of Jesse and Jade . Marital disputes between couples both flesh and plastic follow . Don't laugh , it's good ! The formula of Child's Play was wearing mighty thin by the end of the 3rd film and really needed a fresh new spin to keep it alive . Don Mancini struck the nail right on the head when he turned it into a post-modern horror . Remember , this was back in the days when post-modern horror was all the rage so it might seem just the tiniest bit dated now . But compared to the endless Urban Legend , Scream and I Know yadda yadda films Bride of Chucky seems to have the sharpest wit , the slickest direction and strongest production values . Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with loads of darkness and deep blacks . A horror series like this needs technical superiority and imagination when it comes to direction and Ronny Yu soars over Jack Bender's mundane approach to Child's Play 3 . Composer Graeme Revell returns and delivers a more sophisticated , if slightly generic , score to those awful death-metal guitar / synthesizer cues to Child's Play 3 . His main theme from Child's Play 2 comes and goes briefly and he forgets the huge orchestral mayhem he did before . But he does introduce a very cool Twin Peaks-style love theme for Chuck and Tiff . An alright score overall that really should get a release on CD . Katherine Heigl is very easy on the eye as is Jennifer Tilly ( as a human ) . Plus it also features one of my favorite actors , the Late John Ritter , who died in 2003 . Margot Kidder's gorgeous niece Janet also has a small role and Kathy Najimy ( that's Peggy Hill for you King of the Hill fans ) cameos as a distressed Motel Maid . My only problem is that the film should have been longer , with a more satisfying ending . Chucky has done the Damballa chant so many times now that I just want to see it work for a change . In the DVD commentary Don Mancini said that the film originally had Jesse possessed by Chucky and that the final showdown had more to it . I would have liked to have seen this instead of the weak ending that wound up in the film . For such an elaborate and imaginative horror movie , Bride of Chucky goes out with a whimper instead of a bang . That said , it was still the best of the post-Scream horror films that surfaced in the late-90s and the best of the Chucky series . The subsequent Seed of Chucky was still pretty damn good , but felt like it belonged in a different genre .
564515	102816	26816	8.0	Very Xmas-y	This cartoon probably works best around the holiday season . It's very busy animation indeed as most of the Disney favorites go ice skating on a frozen river ( ! ) . Mickey impresses Minnie with his skating acrobatics , Goofy ( dressed in awful hillbilly gear ) tries to fish using tobacco instead of worms and Donald torments poor old Pluto by sticking skates on his paws and watching him fall all over the place . Donald soon gets what he deserves when a huge gust of wind takes him and his kite / sail thingy off the edge of the waterfall ( which mysteriously has not frozen even though the river has ) . Mickey tries to rescue him but succeeds only in humiliating Donald further . But he did deserve it this time . A very cozy cartoon for Xmas time .
564314	102816	101452	8.0	A wild , imaginative and eccentric fantasy	Sequels rarely improve on the originals . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is bursting at the seams with wacky humor , craziness and invention . Yes , the first was a brilliant ride too but it doesn't live up to this . Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just great in their dual roles as good Bill and Ted and evil Bill and Ted robots from the future . I've never really seen Keanu as convincing in anything else , maybe it's the characters he chooses and not his talent . Too bad his biggest exposure has been as a wooden statue in the god-awful Matrix trilogy . But it's not just Reeves and Winter this time , William Sadler's Grim Reaper is also along for the ride and he steals the show like you've never seen before . Rufus isn't in this one for very long but William Sadler more than makes up for that . The plot is a bit much to swallow if you're not familiar with the mechanics of the original . A nasty old tyrant 700 years in the future sends evil robot Bill and Teds back through time in the phone booth time machines to kill the good Bill and Ted and prevent their perfect society taking over the world . Once dead Bill and Ted go to hell , challenge the Grim Reaper to a game of Battleship , visit God ( after a spot of mugging in heaven ) , get help from a Martian , brought back from the dead , make good Bill and Ted robots and take on the evil Tyrant guy during a Battle of the Bands finale . Whew ! Peter Hewitt ( only 25 at the time ) brings a bizarre sophistication to the sequel that wasn't present in the blandly shot first film . B & TBJ literally looks like a whacked-out cartoon come to life . The production design is very colorful and vivid , reminiscent of Tim Burton , only not crap . Don't misjudge this film as being in the same sub-genre as those awful stoners Jay and Silent Bob or even Wayne's World . This is not a dumb generation Xer film , it's a lovely , silly fantasy for all ages and is definitely superior to the original . Hey Warner , hurry up and release the Bill and Ted animated series on DVD . I want it NOW ! Unlike Excellent adventure , this film was shot in plain-old 1 . 85 : 1 and the anamorphic transfer on the DVD looks fine and does justice to the very broad color pallet of film . The soundtrack is in Remastered Dolby 5 . 1 and it sounds above average if not amazing . Definitely get this . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is thoroughly non-non-non heinous .
563814	102816	100802	9.0	One of Verhoeven's best movies , no doubt .	Arnie is Doug Quaid , a simple construction worker who is bored with his uneventful life and wishes to be more and to do something meaningful . He's fascinated with going to Mars and meeting the mysterious woman of his dreams ( that would be Melina ) despite the civil war brewing withing the colonies . His wife Lori ( Sharon Stone , looking gorgeous ) is appalled with all things Martian and quickly nixes that idea . The only way Quaid is going to come close to the red planet is if he takes a Rekall vacation , a company that literally offers you a ' dream ' vacation memory implant . Quaid wishes to go as a secret agent and all seems well until they send him to sleep . As soon as he's unconscious Quaid seems to wake up in a rage , claiming his name is not Quaid but Hauser . And it's not just the dream going wrong since the Rekall technicians have not even implanted the dream yet . Blacking out again and waking up in a cab , Quaid has totally no recollection of anything that has happened and is confused to find his life turned upside down . His wife and colleagues are trying to kill him , dozens of armed henchmen are after him , he seems to have acquired lethal killing skills from nowhere and he apparently has some unfinished business back on Mars , despite the fact that he's never been there . Or has he ? Once on Mars for real ( or is it ? ) he finds himself involved with the beautiful Melina ( Rachel Ticotin , even prettier than Sharon Stone ) , the underground resistance and battling their arch-nemesis Vilos Cohaagen , a bureaucrat who has the entire planet under his control . It seems that Hauser was Cohaagen's right hand man and left clues for the fabricated Quaid persona to topple Cohaagen's regime . Total Recall is certainly one of Arnie's and Verhoeven's most imaginative and creative movies . The Mars town of Venusville is basically Amsterdam's Red Light District with booze , drugs and sex everywhere , the violence is so ridiculously over-the-top that one cannot help but laugh at it ( despite a lot of the gorier bits being censored by the evil MPAA ) , the vision of the future is incongruously bleak but colorful and fanciful yet primitive . The contrasts between Earth and Mars are similar to Western and Third World comparisons . The visual effects , if slightly dated , are simply amazing . Jerry Goldsmith's awesome score is , at once , atmospheric and action-packed . The set-pieces , especially Quaids vision of the alien furnaces , are just ludicrously entertaining and the ' is it a dream or is it real ' premise puts such a wonderfully surreal twist on the whole thing . Sci-Fi has never been so outrageous . What do you expect with mad genius Dutchman directing ? And I do believe that it IS real .
563923	102816	83972	9.0	A review of the 3-D theatrical version	Last night , the Cameo Cinema in Edinburgh , screened an ultra-rare showing of Friday the 13th Part 3 in all it's gore-splattered 3D glory . The cinema was packed , the screening sold out and the audience absolutely loved it . Every scare worked , the 3D effects leaped right off the screen and lovingly poked us in the eye and when the film was over it got the longest applause I've ever seen a film get . For those pretentious cynics who think that the Friday the 13th films are not great then there's nothing like a 350 + audience to prove you wrong . Since this film was in ' polarised ' 3D ( see-thru glasses instead of a red-blue blur ) then it's not possible to transfer the effect to DVD . Besides , nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with Jason's face 10-feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you . If there is EVER a 3D screening of this then you really ought to go see , even if you have to sell your own grandmother for a ticket .
563820	102816	238924	10.0	Totally great	The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is kind of like a cross between The Virgin Suicides and Stand By Me . Set in the 70's ( featuring many cool 70's haircuts ) in small town Georgia , the story focuses on Francis , a 14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker . He and his pals , Tim , Wade , and Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister Assumpta ( Jodie Foster ) at the Puritan Christian high school they're unfortunate enough to attend . One of their methods of escape is the ' The Atomic Trinity ' comic book . Each of them have their own character with superpowers ( such as The Muscle , Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy ) , battling against the tyrannical regime of Nunzilla / Pegleg ( a gross caricature of Sister Assumpta ) . These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated sequences of the film . The cool thing is that they are not so totally removed from the reality of Francis , Tim , Wade and Joey . The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though . After stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office . A mad plan yes , but their determination and invention behind it is very clever . Some scenes of the film are very emotional , so if you have soft spot you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral . Francis ' relationship with Margie ( the very cute Jenna Malone ) also takes many curious and unique turns . The scene with the ghost watching them sleep was pleasingly weird . Taken from the one and only book ( posthumously ) by Chris Fuhrman ( a book I must get as soon as I see ) , The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is attractively shot , wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen ( strangely non-anamorphic , though the region 2 version is ) with Dolby 5 . 1 sound and a mild bunch of extras .
564343	102816	453502	10.0	One of the best plat-formers for the Genesis	I was a huge fan of James Pond II : Robocod and I loved the theme tune . I remember getting it for Xmas in 1992 and thinking it was so cool . So when this third one came out in 1993 I was first in line to get a copy . I sure do miss the days of the traditional plat-former . There's too much complication and eye-candy these days and I prefer simpler games . Tho I'm not saying this game is simple . The level of game play is so good that it borderlines on being a platformer and RPG . It was one of the first non-linear games I played on the Genesis . Fresh from his defeat at the North Pole , Dr . Maybe heads for the moon in order to mine it's wealth of cheese and flood the global markets . It's up to James Pond to stop him once again . What follows is an incredibly inventive and cute 75 levels of various moon locations . Tho this time there is no sponsorship from Penguin biscuits so don't expect to see them everywhere . The ending is a bit of a let down unless you find all of the missing satellite parts so make sure you scour every level before reaching the exit beacons . And am I the only one in thinking that Dave Arnold's score for ID4 ' borrowed ' from this just a little too much ? I do wish the James Pond franchise had been even half as successful as Sonic the Hedgehog but there may be life in the old guppy yet .
564352	102816	83505	10.0	Absolute genius classic !	There was never anything quite like The Young Ones and there never will be . It's almost impossible to copy this outrageously bizarre and far-fetched TV show anyway . It's even impossible to exaggerate how crazy it was . Do I have to say I totally love it ? each episode is crammed full of eternally quotable dialogue , wonderful physical comedy and insane , unexpected plot developments . The Young Ones takes place in a universe where absolutely ANTHING can and WILL happen . Rick is undeniably the best character tho . He and Vivian get into the stupidest fights and argue over the dumbest of things . Neil the hippy is also consistently amusing in his many failed attempts to off himself . Mike hardly ever had any funny lines but thankfully no episode really ever revolved around him . Plus a Bolowski family member ( always played by Alexi Sayle ) pops up in each episode to add to the mayhem . What makes the show priceless are the totally irrelevant and senseless intercut scenes . Check out the episode ' CASH ' for the best example of this . And , in an effort to raise the budget from ' sitcom ' to ' light entertainment ' the show had a musical performance each week from the likes of Jools Holland , Madness and Motorhead . They never intrude tho as they are cut over madcap montages . It speaks volumes of the youth of 80's Britain and has a lot to say about the politics of the Tory Government at the time . All four play penniless students , surviving on lentils , who are completely unconcerned about their exams or coming bottom in the whole world . This is mainly channelled thru Rick ( Mayall co-wrote the show with Ben Elton ) who is the most studenty of them all , a wannabe anarchist and people's poet . Vyvian is a hard , hardcore Sex Pistols-like punk / thug who thinks nothing of having steel stars stuck onto his forehead or chopping his fingers off for a laugh . Neil smells . And has no quibbles picking up dead pigeons off the street to cook for dinner . Mike is a ladies man , despite the fact there are precious few ladies around him . All four get on like a house burning down . Or exploding like a cigar thrown into fart gas . The show was shot on early 80's video with an aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . the picture quality is not the best but it's always looked like a TV show so it's perfectly adequate . The sound is Mono but that's all you need to enjoy . The extras seem cool but they're not really . There is a bonus episode from Filthy Rich and Catflap and one from Bottom ( the episode ' Smells ' in which Ritchie and Eddie try to lure two lesbians with foul-smelling pheromone spray ) . The 15-minutes long ' Creating the Young Ones ' is quite superficial and deserved to be much longer . And where are the new interviews with Edmondson , Ryan and Sayle ? The same applies to ' The Young Ones and the 80s ' . Why wasn't it longer ? Five postcards of all the main stars are also included in the set . And you must buy it .
564416	102816	122690	10.0	Brilliance	John Frankenheimer didn't have a lot of credibility in his last few years . His final film was the rather crap Reindeer Games , with Ben Affleck , and in 1996 he gave us the utterly terrible Island Of Doctor Moreau . However , he did do Ronin in 1998 , which makes up for absolutely everything . It is a detachment from glossy , MTV-directed , Hollywood action movies . If you want trash , like Bad Boys 2 , then this isn't for you . Ronin returns to the gritty , rustic and deadly serious actioners of the Seventies , much like Frankenheimer's own French Connection 2 . The title refers to Samurai warriors in ancient Japan who were left with no cause , or purpose , if their master was killed . They'd roam the countryside , pretending to be thieves , beggars , even madmen and hiring their skills out to the highest bidder . Much like the lost , wandering freelancers that make up our cast of characters . Robert De Niro is Sam , an ex-CIA agent ( or is he ? ) , who bands together with a ragtag group of similar ex-spies for a " no questions asked " job with what appears to be the IRA . First we have Vincent ( the wonderful Jean Reno ) , as a French agent who knows where to find just about anything you want . Spence ( Sean Bean ) is a gung-ho SAS dropout who is waaaaay out of his depth and ends up jeopardising the whole mission . Gregor ( Stellan Skarsgard ) , an ex-KGB spy who knows his gadgets and another American called Larry ( who is rather disposable ) . All of these men are led by Deirdre ( Natascha McElhone ) , a young Irish woman who answers to Seamus O'Rourke ( Jonathan Price ) , an IRA boss who is in a lot of trouble with his superiors . Still with me ? No ? Well I'm gonna continue anyway . The group's mission is to steal a metallic briefcase from the Russian Mafia . The contents of this case are a mystery ; all we know is that a lot of people are willing to pay mucho plento to get their hands on it . As if the set-up wasn't tenuous enough , there is immediately too much suspicion within the group to bear . And the already complicated plot is thrown into endless chaos as double-crosses , double-double-crosses , secrets and lies screw things up in a big , big way . It sounds tough going , but it's not really . I'll admit I didn't really like Ronin when I first saw it ( or the second or third for that matter ) , but it's one of those movies that creeps back on you . Frankenheimer's direction is so flawless and masterful that every frame of every scene flows effortlessly The acting is so well rehearsed and the cast so well chosen that even in every gesture , idiosyncrasy and subtle glance you can read into the characters's hidden motives . It takes a good number of viewings to decipher Ronin , but when the story is this well done , who cares ? Since its release there have been few action films that have come close to its intensity . Some , like Bourne Identity / Supremacy try to emulate its bleak tone , but don't match up . Supremacy has a car chase that was desperate to beat Ronin's , but is far too flashy . That's also the ace up it's sleeve . About 80 minutes into the film , the second car chase is a juggernaut of film-making . Never before and probably never again for a long , long time , has there been a car chase so completely mental . No Michael Bay 1000 cuts a second , no slow-motion , no stunts silhouetted against the sunset , just sheer , relentless adrenaline , as DeNiro and Reno tear up the streets of Paris . It's the centrepiece of the movie and a perfect example of what REAL action film-making is . Elia Cmiral's score is the other utterly perfect aspect of the movie . Simultaneously lonely , seductive and mysterious , it surely is one of the best themes ever and anyone with sense would go out and buy the soundtrack CD right away . Though most jive turkeys will disagree - with the Gator ? How dare you ! - Ronin is perfection from beginning to end , from Frankenheimer's strong , imposing direction to David Mamet's script , riddled with cryptic dialogue and double-meanings . No one can deny Ronin's importance as a real action picture . No one can watch crap like xXx , or 6 Fast 6 Furious , and claim Ronin to be a bad movie . It has enough , maybe too much , integrity and intelligence to shame anything that comes even halfway close . If you're sick of action flicks , or films in general , where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information , then Ronin is the cure . It may sound like a bizarre comparison , but it's on par with Lost Highway , as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time .
564061	102816	424451	10.0	Bursting with coolness	There's a lot going on in this game and so many devices and sub-games to keep you addicted . Not so much a DX than an updated version of the Sonic Adventure , from the now obsolete Dreamcast , with better graphics , new missions and loads of extras . You play the game as seven different characters : Sonic , Tails , Knuckles , Amy , Big the Cat , The Robot Dude and ( much later ) Super Sonic . The Sonic , Tails and Knuckles levels are the best . The Big the Cat levels are really boring and slow . Each character has their own story and their own power-ups , all happening at the same time . The result is almost an RPG-like game . If this were taken a few steps further who knows how great the game could have been . Though it's still brilliant as it is . The structure is also genius and easy to get to grips with . As whatever character , you run around massive levels like Station Square and The Mystic Ruins which leads to many different action stages . The action stages can range between casinos , snowboarding , racing through sky-high circuits , go-carting , flying around in Tails ' red bi-plane , flying through wind tunnels , chases across the city rooftops and racing across sandy beaches . As always the Sonic world ( curiously earthlike and nothing like the planet Mobius from before ) is absolutely gorgeous with an exotic feel , eternal sunshine and the bluest of skies . What I like best about the game are the Chao . The cute little creatures you hatch and raise between levels . They are so great they became my reason for getting through the game . And as a bonus all Sonic games from the old Sega Game Gear are included . Each one is unlocked after every 20 emblems collected ( 1 awarded after each mission complete and others scattered about levels ) . Some parts of the game can be awfully repetitive . Certain FMV sequences were used more than once and there was no point in that . And intros to certain parts of the game took too long and became quite annoying when losing a life and starting again . The self-controlled camera was cool and useful . Though in cramped quarters it seemed to get stuck and being unable to see the character due to the spasming camera sometimes resulted in the loss of a life . That was quite annoying . The music is great and I strongly suggest you get all the soundtrack CDs ( I did ) . There are brilliant , fun-loving themes that totally carry the action along . The voices however , were a bit off from the original Japanese lip movements . A totally brilliant game that you simply must get . Sonic Adventure DX will keep you entertained for ages . Graphics A Sound A Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564405	102816	814329	10.0	One of the best !	I used to love Public Information Films when I was a kid . Some of them were masterpieces of tension and scares . Always filmed on 16mm , always stark and to-the-point and mostly always featuring children as the victims . You were glued to the screen . There's just something so hauntingly brilliant about them and The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water is no exception . Directed by Rolf Harris , the film had Donald Pleasance play the voice of The Spirit-a sinister , robed apparition who would always be present when some foolish person ended up in a lake / pond / etc when they couldn't swim or when no one else could help . Of course the Spirit was powerless against sensible children but the echoing warning of ' I'll be back-ack-ack-ack ' reminded you that going for a dip in a flooded quarry would probably be dumb thing to do .
564701	102816	87469	10.0	Anything goes !	Set before the events of ' Raiders ' , Dr . Jones is in Shanghai doing business with Chinese crime boss Lau Che . Losing the upper hand in a night club he barely escapes with his life ( and baggage in the form of Willie Scott and sidekick kid Short Round ) to the airport . But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping . After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy , Willie and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Shankara stones . Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones , Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hellbent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion . Temple of Doom is , without a shadow of a doubt , the best Indiana Jones film . I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker , nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word ' go ' ! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another . The opening musical number , the fight in the Obi-Wan Club , the chase through Shanghai , the plane crash / dingy ride , the journey to Pankot Palace , the dinner scene , the human sacrifice , the freeing of the slaves , the mine-cart ride , the water rush , the rope bridge , the cliff-hanging . . . wow ! How much more can you pack into a film ? It's physically impossible ! Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark , Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic . I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else . If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America , no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody . John Williams ' brilliant music is also at it's best . He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark , which is quite rare . The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects ( beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters ) which , when viewed today , at least might seem a little bit dated , but still hold up quite well . Or course , there's nothing really important about the film . I mean it won't beat Schindler's List or Munich in terms of drama but if you want escapism and soaring , thrill-a-minute adventure his name is Indiana Jones and the place is the Temple of Doom .
563917	102816	96061	10.0	Father LOVES Beaver !	Acid Rain . Drug Addiction . International Terrorism . Freeway Killers . Now , more than ever , it is important to remember the TRUE meaning of Christmas ! Don't miss Bill Murray's immortal classic Scrooged . You're life might just depend on it . Christmas Specials are a big deal , with some of them ( such as Charlie Brown and The Grinch ) going down in TV history . When it comes to story a lot of lazy staff writers just milk the Christmas Carol goat and there are millions of different takes out there to prove it with Roseanne and the original Star Trek series all doing their own rip-offs . IBC boss Frank Cross ( Bill Murray dressed up as Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother ) is a delightfully wicked man of hate who is planning his very own live broadcast of said story . Little does he know that very tale is about to wind its way into his life . Why I like Frank Cross is because he's a lot like me . He's mean to those beneath him , yields power with a ruthless swagger and is sarcastic to just about everyone . If you disagree with him in even the slightest , tiniest little way he'll fire you . Just like I would . But on this certain Xmas Eve life is getting very weird for him . The owner of the station is doubting his abilities to undertake such a heavy production , a slimy Californian director is trying to muscle-in on his job and his dead boss comes back to haunt him . He brings an important message that if he doesn't change his way he's going to hell and that three ghosts , of Xmas past , present and future , are going to show him the results of his evilness . In the hands of just another comedy director this would have been a missed opportunity , but Richard Donner shoots the film as a supernatural fantasy and gives it a pretty superior shine . Something Brian Levant could never do . And let's not forget Bill Murray , the guy is a genius no matter what he does and he dominates the whole film with his loud an maniacal performance . Everything he says seems to be ad-libbed and babbles some brilliant one-liners and sarcasm . Most people are put-off by the ending and claim that when the nastiness stops and sentiment kicks in the film goes downhill . I don't feel this way . In a world where Xmas is commercialised and the time of year where people go in huge debt we need a constant reminder of what we should be feeling . No one is asking you to celebrate the fact that Wal-Mart are selling cheap turkeys or that greedy stores have a limited stock of $700 X-Boxes . At the end Frank Cross , the world's biggest scrooge and non-believer , tells us that it's the fun , the determination to make a difference , the easiness of changing someone's life and the spirit of the holiday season that really matters . You don't have to hate it and if you surrender your pride and just give it a go then maybe the miracle to happen to you to . For me , Scrooged has been an annual tradition for years and will continue to be so . Not only is it very funny but , in its own way , very important . If you give a little , you can get back a whole lot more . Sounds corny , I know but Xmas is what you make it . And you only get a small amount so it's best to make every one count . This movie is a step in the right direction .
564606	102816	465922	10.0	Infuriating , but great fun	Think of it like Tetris only with letters in the blocks . You've got to link up letters to make words . If you feed the bookworm too many small words he'll send down fiery red letters . You must use them right away before they blow up your whole game . Sound easy ? It's not . My longest word so far has been 8 letters . And did I mention the music is very , very cute . I've played the PC version , which , unlike the GBA version keeps high scores and has online ranking . There are online scores of about 50 billion . I don't think I'll be beating it . Nonetheless , it's quite possibly the most addictive game ever . Graphics A Sound A Gameplay A Lasting Appeal
563835	102816	302327	10.0	Chilling , atmospheric and utterly terrifying !	Though the game has been around for years I've never taken interest in Resident Evil until recently . I got the game for dirt cheap and was surprised how good it is . I saw my cousin play the old Playstation version years ago and was unimpressed but for the Gamecube the graphics have been re-rendered to absolute lifelike perfection . The shadows , the sound , the ambiance and those thunderclaps . . . all highly , highly realistic . Play this with your Gamecube hooked up to your home theatre . And like me , you'll totally jump out of your skin at the scary parts ( many of them ) . My main hint is conserve your ammo . If you see a zombie , put it down right away ( no funny stuff ) and burn it . Take care of them one at a time . And if you don't burn them they will soon come back as Crimson Heads-faster , deadlier , scarier . Much like the Myst series , Resident Evil is one of those games where you have to keep your eyes and ears open . Clues and puzzle pieces are scattered all over the place and you need to pay attention . Don't be put off by the size of the mansion . After a short while it's easy to get your bearing and find your way through rather easily . Though I will be honest with the fact I did not understand most of the story . I have no idea what Trevor's diary from 1968 had to do with the plot and I really didn't get why Umbrella would create the T-Virus . I know there are various ways to finish and complete the game though . Especially seeing as how there are many clips during the end credits that did not happen in my game play ( I did it in just over 8 hours ) . If you finish it in certain time frames the next one is always different somehow . I only managed to unlock a new outfit for Chris . Wow ! My only gripe is about those boring ' door opening ' cut scenes . They really got on my nerves . Still , it's a chilling game that will freak you out if you play alone in the dark . Well worth the time and money .
563954	102816	414993	10.0	The most indescribably brilliant movie in years .	This is probably the most difficult film to review ever . The Fountain isn't going to sound like much if I give you just a brief plot synopsis . But I'll give it a go . Tom Creo , a brilliant Doctor , is searching for a cure for cancer . His wife Izzy is dying and his research on Monkeys only seems to mysteriously reverse the ageing process . The secret ingredient to his new medicine is taken from a magic tree in South America . The tree of life , or the fountain of youth . Whatever you want to call it . As Izzy slips away , Tom becomes intrigued with her unfinished novel The Fountain . It turns out that the novel is about Tom and Izzy's past lives as a Spanish Queen and Captain in South America hundreds of years ago . And the only way Tom can finish the book is if he stays around for the future , when he can literally take the long-dead Izzy into the heavens . Phew ! That sounds disconcertingly strange , but trust me it's an amazing experience . Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are brilliant , delivering multi-layered performances . The dialogue avoids soap opera clichés of dying young and instead is filled with many philosophic double meanings and a lot of undeclared emotions . I could go on for ages about how good it all is from the direction , gorgeous cinematography , beautiful score , flawless storytelling etc . But I think you get the point already . What The Fountain mostly resembles is the most beautiful , otherworldly dream you've ever had but can barely remember . It's a hypnotic movie filled with moments that will stay with you forever . Just when you think the film has given you all that it has to offer it surprises you with more and more amazing revelations . To deny yourself a movie like this would be a heinous act . There's just so much about it I can rave on about . But I won't . Go see for yourself .
564361	102816	129167	10.0	Brilliant movie	But it should have been longer . I distinctly remember an entirely different ending in the book . I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young . But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine . There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun . But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant . But the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero . It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic . I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard . You cannot dislike the Iron Giant . I think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2 . 35 : 1 . Most cartoons by Disney are in 1 . 85 : 1 or even worse ? in 1 . 66 : 1 . Warner did a great job with this movie . These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations . But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie . My only gripe is that it should have been longer . At 87 minutes , it's all over too quick . But it's still cool .
563885	102816	40422	10.0	One giant leap for Rabbitkind !	Bugs Bunny ' volunteers ' somewhat reluctantly ( kicking and screaming ) to be the first earthling blasted into space . He perks up however when they fill the rocket to the brim with carrots . After a bone-crushing spell of g-force he lands a little too roughly on the moon and decides to go for a little sight-seeing . On his journey he meets Marvin the Martian ( who sounds a little bit different than usual ) and his usual plans to blow up the earth for some insane reason . As usual , hijinks and endless outsmarting follow , all to wonderful effect . It's in this type of anarchy and imagination that Bugs and the rest of the Looney Tunes prove how ingenious they really are .
564572	102816	272152	10.0	Mork and Mindy	Much like Mork left Ork to come to earth for the second time and visit Mindy McConnell , Prot leaves K-Pax to come to earth for the second time to visit Dr . Brewer , a psychiatrist who thinks that Prot is a crazy human but it becomes increasingly likely that he's the real deal . But there is a mystery to Prot's background , a mystery Dr . Brewer is determined to unravel and the way he does so , with the minimal of clues ( always the best in mysteries ) is quite clever and interesting . Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges ( forever THE DUDE whether he likes it or not ) are brilliant as alien and earthling . The whole movie is very beautifully made with wonderful use of rainbow colors , great editing , fun supporting characters and a delightful score by Edward Shearmur . Seriously , if you're stressed then this is THE movie to calm you down . Movies about aliens fascinated by strange earth customs are always enjoyable . Spacey might not be running around wild like the manic Robin Williams , quite the opposite actually , but his grace and dignity are far more than most humans match up to . K-Pax attempts some kind of ambiguity in the ending but if you hang around to the very end of the credits you'll realize that Dr . Brewer is still curious of Prot's origin's despite what his Robert Porter evidence is telling him . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby / DTS 5 . 1 sound and loads of interesting extras .
563924	102816	86465	10.0	Ahmwoonanawoonanawoonana-huh !	This is one of the best comedies out there , made back in the days when John Landis was still good . It is bursting with brilliant scenes for fans to act out and loads of hilarious lines to recite . I find myself doing this quite a lot . Who cannot resist Eddie Murphy's foreign exchange student disguise or Ackroyd's Lionel Josef . The ape in the train is a thigh-slapper too . For a comedy it has a great plot and a decent running time but it has dated quite a bit . Please though , no remake . Let this film stand on it's own as proof that Ackroyd , Murphy and Landis were once brilliant at what they did .
564659	102816	81568	10.0	The truth only depends on the angle you're watching from .	This was director Richard Rush's dream project and it took him nine years to get it on the screen . And , of course , it would ! It's multi-layered , original , funny and packed full of story and circumstance that makes you think . Why would any studio want to touch it ? Fox even sat on it for two years before giving it a limited release . Now , Anchor Bay has created the ultimate DVD and I urge you to buy it . The Stunt Man is a movie you'll never forget and even on its umpteenth viewing , still manages to be as intriguing as the first . It is a story told from the view of Cameron ( Steve Railsback ) , a Vietnam vet on the run from the law . He stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie and accidentally kills a stunt driver . The director of the movie is the eccentric and megalomaniacal Eli Cross ( Peter O'Toole , in one of his best ever performances ) , who takes Cameron under his wing and protects him from John Law , as long as he keeps his mouth shut about the accident . Cameron practices to be a stunt artist and takes the place of the man he killed . But as the movie shoot becomes more elaborate and dangerous , he falls in love with the leading lady ( Barbara Hershey ) and starts to suspect that Eli is trying to capture his death on film . Although it seems nasty , the movie is wonderfully light-hearted and the outrageous stunt scenes are backed up by a joyous score by Dominic Frontiere . I've been humming that theme since I was 12-years-old . A long scene with Cameron running over a rooftop , as biplanes attack and enemy soldiers give chase , is the stuff of legend . There is a great comic sense of humor in watching them trip over each other , fall off and get blown up . John Law do not back down on their suspicion of Eli and , through half-heard conversations and eavesdropping , Cameron's paranoia becomes increasingly justified . Because the movie is seen through his eyes we never quite know what is going on with Eli . Is he a madman , or just a crafty director ? Would you believe that O'Toole based his performance on his experiences with David Lean ? Why he never won an Oscar - it went to Robert DeNiro for Raging Bull - is beyond me . He truly gives the performance of his career , far exceeding even Laurence of Arabia . It also sucks that Rush never won for Director , or Adapted Screenplay . Had he been awarded the golden statuette , maybe he would have received more recognition . He's clearly a better filmmaker than most of today's hack artists . You simply have to see The Stunt Man . It's an overlooked gem and , despite the wide praise it received , it has never really reached a large audience . Now is definitely the time to rediscover this forgotten classic .
564420	102816	116830	10.0	I love it to death	This has to be one of the best action , western and gangster movies I've ever seen . Willis was perfect for the part of John Smith ( his voice-over has some of the best dialogue ever and if you don't believe me check out the opening scene ) , a gun for hire without a conscience . All elements of each genre are highly spoken for . The editing , dialogue , cinematography , music , direction and acting are all top class . Everything is fantastically overblown but never preposterous . As for the film itself , it is very empty but the mood and tone are so very distant and weird , and I totally love it . Walter Hills direction is a well balanced cross between Sam Peckinpah and John Woo . And Cooder's score will transport you right into the movie even on it's own . This wall always be one of my fave movies and it is very much worthy of 5 stars . The 2 . 50 : 1 anamorphic picture is stunning and there are rumors that Hill originally wanted to make it in B / W but New Line Cinema would not let him . To test this out turn your color right down and see how much the film's atmosphere is enhanced from already gloomy to undeniably depressing , BUT IT IS SO COOL . The DD 5 . 1 sound quality on this DVD during the gunfights is absolutely amazing . It will bug the hell out of your neighbors , but who cares ? Every now and again Walter Hill injects a sudden burst of ferocious , furious and brutal violence that takes your breath away . When people are killed they don't just fall down , they FLY across the room and thru windows . Extras are brief and not very good ( Cast Bios say that Die Hard 4 was released in 1998 ! ) and there is a cool clip of Loaded Weapon 1 hidden in there too .
