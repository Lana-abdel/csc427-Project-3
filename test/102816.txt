563953	102816	295178	1.0	My God , it's just . . . AWFUL ! ! !	I've never liked the Austin Powers movies ( or Mike Myers for that matter ) as they have always come across as being the product of an over-indulgent , but not very bright , imagination . They'll all so flimsy and crudely stapled together that it baffles me why people adore them and spend $200 million + at the box office . Are we so braindead and slovenly that utter , utter garbage like this is what passes for our collective sense of humor ? As previously , the film is just random scenes of nonsense connected in the most superficial of ways with a moronic ' plot ' . And don't give me ' but that's the point ' , because I don't think that excuses it for having absolutely no class or sophistication whatsoever . Everything , from the camp static sets to the pathetic widescreen photography reeks of Wal-Mart movie making . It's all so amateur . I actually walked out of the 2nd Austin Powers film ( and I really should have just switched this one off but Michael Caine kept me watching ) as the character of Fat Bastard seriously offended me . I don't think it's fair to make Scotland the butt of such a vile , xenophobic joke . But , I guess that's as far as Myer's imagination goes when creating characters as everyone here in this film is nothing more than a cultural stereotype . Quite irresponsible for a wannabe-blockbuster . I wish I could say that if I ignore a monster such as this , it would go away . But that just won't happen . Let's just thank our lucky stars that no more Austin Powers films have been made since this drek .
564114	102816	323531	1.0	Mother Theresa in a gangbang ! What is this ? ? ?	Either Steven Seagal has absolutely NO self-respect or the Mob were just too damn scary for him when it came to signing the contract for this total pile of crap . They couldn't even be bothered to come up with an good title . Instead the took Hard to Kill and Out for Justice and combined them ( Hard to Justice ? ) . But don't even think for one minute that this film is up to the standards of Seagal's golden years . You'll NEVER see anything worse than this . Well , Son of the Mask maybe . Seagal plays an archaeologist ( well , it's a change from Cop or ex-CIA ) who's precious Chinese artifacts and pots are seized by the Tong ( the non-threatening Chinese Syndicate baddies ) and stuffed with brown sugar ( or cocaine , I don't know ) . Big Steve stumbles upon this dastardly deed and takes off for the Uzbekistan border . A hundred baddies come out of nowhere and start firing at him . Big Steve is promptly framed and sent to jail , where he meets a character introduced as his new sidekick but is quickly forgotten about and never seen or heard from again . What the hell was the point in this ? It turns out that Steve used to be in the CIA ( oh for the love of crumb cake ) and was their best ghost thief ( huh ? ) and the DEA release him for some reason and he goes home to his quiet American suburb , where the Tong blow up his wife and house . Steve goes on a killing spree . But what helps is that every Chinaman who's neck he breaks has a one-word tattoo on his arm that when added up makes an ancient Chinese proverb that provides the right order of tiles to push in case of fire in the Tong bosses office . What ? Don't look at me ! I didn't write this ! The bad guys don't do anything apart from sit at a long table in a poorly-lit and cold-looking room and smoke cigars while looking evil . The boss isn't even Chinese but an Ian Hislop-lookalike with bushy eyebrows . Every 10 minutes the film will jump to them ( subtitles list their hobbies and interests for some strange reason ! ) and the boss goes ' We have to stop him , he knows too much ' . The fight scenes are horrible . What is the deal with the kung-fu monkey barber ? Seriously ! What is the deal with that ? The computer-generated effects are the worst ever ( second to Son of the Mask , nothing will beat that in terms of terribleness ) . I've seen more convincing stuff on a ZX Spectrum . Seagal puts NO effort into this film . He looks incredibly bored through-out and looks like he'd rather be praying to Budda . However , you can almost see Frankie Fingers from The Mob loitering off-camera , pointing a gun at his head . I know I wouldn't show enthusiasm if that were the case . Out for a Kill is directed by Mike Oblonglowiscz , the same amateur responsible for the equally as horrible The Foreigner . The man has NO idea how to make films and should never be allowed near a camera again . He desperately tries to mime Michael Bay ( a dubious choice of inspiration ) with his pointless stutter-cuts and incoherent editing which only makes the film look worse , turning it into an avalanche on top of another avalanche . It's quite possibly one of the ugliest-looking film you'll ever see . Considering some of the high-profile and veteran production members it's phenomenal they made a film so indescribably bad . Eternal , everlasting shame on all those involved with making this trash . Utter crap of the lowest order . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen , showing off the ugly photography and poorly planned camera angles in all their rubbishy glory . The Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack also turns the films unbelievably bad sound design into pure torture for the ears . The cover also features 2 exploding helicopters . There are no helicopters in the entire film , never mind exploding ones .
564622	102816	95271	1.0	Shockingly bad !	It's frightening to think that if this movie was never made we would never have been subjected to the dreck that is Halloween 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 . And the double shame is that even tho the story here is silly it is at least interesting . The continuation of this was the only decent thing about Halloween 5 and it may well have been good in 6 too but that movie all rearranged and jumbled before it hit out screens . So what we have here is a collection of dull murders with bad story continuity . H20 and Resurrection pretended that 4 , 5 and 6 never happened . There is no REAL backbone or history to this series . All they represent is a producer who asks us to pay money for the same thing over and over . We cannot use photocopied money to pay for our tickets at the box office so the movie-makers owe us something new . And in Halloween 4 we don't get it . In fact I'm sure that to the untrained eye Halloween 4 and 5 could very well be the same movie . And it is SO slow ! Nothing really happens for about 70 minutes worth of the movies 88 minute running time . It leaves you begging for a Jason Voorhees style mass murder spree . That does not happen I'm sorry to say . The movie cuts away at the point of every death and when it doesn't the deaths are dull and boring . A man is thrown onto an electrical power grid and . . . sparks fly . That's it ? How about his face melting or at least getting set on fire ? Plus the body count is shockingly low . What is up with the thumb thru the head ? Not only is it badly shot , too quick and just plain puzzling ( surely a quick neck snap would be easier and nastier ) the physical possibilities of it match hammering a tack into a concrete slab . It just can't happen . I don't care how superhuman Michael Myers unexplained powers are . The whole ' motiveless psycho ' may have worked well in Carpenter's original but here it's asking for money for old rope . Carpenter used it to great effect and scriptwriter Alan B . McElroy ( responsible for some awesome Spawn episodes ) uses it as an excuse for lazy , unimaginative writing . Tho he has the scriptwriters strike to blame as he beat the deadline by mere hours . But even a few hours worth more imagination could have made this the tiniest bit better . There's just not much for Myers to do . He comes out of a coma , goes back to Haddonfield and kills . For no reason . There are no sets other than houses and no opportunity for big excitement or set-pieces . I'm sorry but the ' famous ' rooftop scene is boring , badly rehearsed and badly shot . Director Dwight H . Little ( Marked For Death , Murder at 1600 ) even throws in a 10 second scene in an Elementary school for no reason . Plus the only shot of Michael in this shows him with WHITE hair on his mask . A pretty big goof , lookout for it . Out of all the lessons in how to make an effective horror film that were were taught in the first film none of them are really echoed here . Slasher flicks by their very nature are low brow but Carpenter had a simplistic purity and charm that made it work . Plus he filmed the movie in Panavision which instantly gives it some class . Plus he used the widescreen framing well . Dwight H . Little seems oblivious to this and instead uses standard 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen with no particular flare . And I must mention the very poor dialogue . It offers no insight into the lives of the teenagers in the story or provides them with extra character . Why are we supposed to care when they get killed . It's obvious from the beginning that they are nothing but fodder for Michael Myers . And it's a crime that when they die it's not even graphic or ugly in the slightest . Just boring and badly shot . It's not a horror film because nothing horrifies or upsets other than paying money to see it . Stay well away . Go watch a Friday the 13th movie and see the J-Man do his thing . Anchor Bay presents this DVD in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen . The print is grainy and rather dirty . Nothing of reference quality . Sorry . There soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5 . 1 from the original Ultra Stereo tracks . It's good enough . One hardly expects a sophisticated soundtrack from a film of this nature . In fact I prefer it to the obnoxiously loud sound designs of more recent slasher flicks . A 16 minute documentary , offering new interesting insight to the movie , is included . The participants don't have much to say and seem to regard the film in a higher manner than it deserves . An original theatrical poster replica poses as the cover on a ' 4-page booklet ' ( wow-1 sheet of paper ) containing some more info about the movie . The DVD itself comes in one of those beautiful Limited Edition Tins . My copy is number 05 , , 000 .
563938	102816	440272	1.0	Crap	What a horrible game ! I would describe Dick Tracy as a run-and-gun platformer but that would kind of a lie as it is horrible slow and plodding with no sense of excitement at all . It's one of those horrible games where that generic baddies shoot at you and you see this little white dot that is supposed to be a bullet move across the screen very slowly . In real life it would easy to dodge but the little Dick Tracy sprite moves likes he's stuck in cement . There are some levels where you shoot the place up but you can do very little damage and since nothing becomes of it other than the background changing slightly , it's kinda pointless . The music is awful too . Who makes these awful tunes ? The graphics do resemble the bright primary colors of the comic-strip though and it's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this otherwise completely disposable game . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564356	102816	120694	1.0	Tedious	Why on earth was this film made ? It has NOTHING to do with the last 5 Halloween movies and is NOT scary or frightening or worth any attention . Well , maybe that's a lie . Michelle Williams is worth attention and is the only reason for watching this piece of cp . But it's not like she's in it much . The film is only 84 minutes long and has about 5 scenes . I don't even consider this to be an official Halloween movie . It was only made to cash in on the ' Scream ' craze of teenagers being staked by a masked killer . Seeing as how Halloween was the very first Slasher flick I guess Miramax thought that this would be the Zenith of the craze . How wrong they were . All deaths are pointless and meaningless and Jamie-Lee's attempt at being a Ripley-like chick with balls doesn't work . Plain and simple . File this movie under bad . Really , really bad . Jason Voorhees , come back , all is forgiven .
564142	102816	290747	1.0	Mind-numbingly awful !	I will not spend too long reviewing this turd as I am still very annoyed that I spend 90 minutes of my precious time watching it . Instead I will simply say that Man-Thing is not only the worst comic-book movie ever made , but it is also one of the worst films ever made ever . I cannot believe that utter trash like this comes to DVD but Howard the Duck does not . Set in the Deep South but filmed in Austrailia with Ozzie soap actors ( who are so expressionless and wooden you can almost see the sawdust flaking off them ) the film is an hour and a half of the most mundane , generic blandness you could ever imagine . Almost nothing happens as characters sleepwalk from scene to scene , all being pointlessly killed by a pointless monster . Brett ( I've never directed a good film in my life ) Leonard shoots the film like a TV movie with either a green filter or an orange filter over the lens ( oooh . . . how atmospheric ) as his only means of ' sophistication ' . The man began life with The Lawnmower man , so he didn't really have so far to fall before making this pile of crap . My God , it's just so bad . Never waste time or money on this . I beg you !
564279	102816	294537	1.0	What the . . . ? ? ?	As a huge fan of the original arcade game I was astounded at how awful ( and weird ) this threequel . The gameplay is non-existent . For a side-scrolling beat-'em-up this fails to be engaging on every level ( pun intended ) . There is NO skill involved in any of it . Most punches and kicks fail to connect , none of the enemies differentiate from each other and it's too slow and sluggish . In fact it's a lot like the terrible Double Dragon game on the Commodore 64 . A game so bad it's been the butt of many thousands of jokes since I first got it FOURTEEN YEARS AGO ! I just don't understand what's going on in this game . Who is the creepy little E . T . guy ? Why do big hands and cubes of non-moving / threatening concrete ( ! ) come out the ground to kill you ? What's the deal with the headless ninja corpses that turn into tree trunks when you kill them ? I kid you not , this game is one of the most baffling artifacts in the whole universe . Forget the Turin Shroud . If you like the genre play the Streets of Rage games and forget this travesty . It's amazing games this bad are made .
563983	102816	97474	1.0	Horrible film with terrible acting	Never before have a seen a film that has been RUINED so much by the AWFUL teenagers ( ? ) on display . They have nothing to do with the plot and contribute nothing to the film . All they do is run around throwing up appalling dialogue , most of which is shockingly bad ADR . There is a massive scene in a barn , which has nothing to do with anything , and is really only there to pad the film . They ruin the entire movie and I was VERY disappointed . The scenes with Michael Myers ( now played by Don Shanks instead of George P . Wilbur ) , Doctor Loomis and Jamie are the only reason I didn't eject this film . They are the saving grace of this movie . But , unfortunately , all the grace in the Universe cannot make us forgive this film for having such POINTLESS and MEANINGLESS characters who turn it from almost a ' psychological horror ' to a ' sub-standard cliché ' . It's a shame . Halloween 4 , 5 and 6 started an ongoing plot line that was ignored in the abysmal Halloween H20 and it was also cut to shreds in the severely edited and re-arranged Halloween 6 : The Curse of Michael Myers . The fact that 4 , 5 and 6 could have been very good makes this film worthy of attention . The fact that 4 , 5 and 6 suck is the fault of the creators .
564274	102816	483987	1.0	This is such a horrible game !	Ugh ! I remember seeing a review for this game in the old ' Mega ' magazine from Future Publishing back in 1993 . They gave it a bad review but I was still keen to play it as I like most Bond movies and the graphics looked bright and colorful . Well , it took me 12 years to get the game for a decent price ( that would be 99p instead of £39 : 99 ) and I must tell you right now that the game IS rancid and I can't believe that rotten junk like this used to sell for such a high RRP . The story involves Bond running all over an island complex defusing bombs and rescuing generic blonde bimbos ( Bond girls ? ) and shooting at generic villains . It's extremely dull . And what makes it worse is that the music is also downright horrible , the sound effects are laughable ( checkout the sound of ' going downstairs footsteps ) and the controls are stiff , slow and sluggish . Which is pretty much the kiss of death for an action game that relies on quick reflexes . The levels are also poorly designed . Yes , it's a platformer , but you never know which platforms you can stand on and which you'll just fall through . It's so annoying and will cost you many lives . Plus , some things you can walk through , while others are impenetrable . Each level is a maze without meaning to be . And since the game is so very , very slow , making your way through them becomes a long and arduous task . Never buy this game for any reason . Stay well away from it . It sucks so bad .

563968	102816	450955	1.0	Appalling in every way !	This is pretty much the worst and most over-hyped game of 2005 and made a lot of ' bottom 10 ' lists in many magazines last month . And it bloody deserves it . The problems with this game begin before you even lift it off the shelf in the store . I mean take a look at the cover . It's 50 Cent , one of the few African American ' role models ' around these days , in a defencive pose with a stereotypical ' angry black guy ' look on his face ( oh , please don't hurt me Mr . Cent ! ) . Now I am not a fuddy-duddy conservative who blames people like Marilyn Manson for corrupting kids or whatever because I know kids are more intelligent than adults give them credit for . But America is a very racist country and when 50 Cent misrepresents the Black Community and backs up the xenophobic myth that all Black people are evil or killers or gang-bangers in some way I can't help but get very annoyed . Second of all is the fact that this drivel game is no more than a laughable male fantasy . Yes , I know Mr . Cent has been shot 9 times but it was all at once with low calibre bullets . It's not as if he goes out and gets shot at every day and is immune to all lead fired in the direction of his person . I know 50 Cent has had a really , REALLY , RE-EALLY tough life , that I would not wish upon anyone . But when violence and death have haunted you your whole life the LAST thing you should do is capitalise on a game that glorifies gun-play and gang warfare . That's just disgusting and perverse and if Mr . Cent truly ' kept it real ' ( what a ridiculous , meaningless phrase ) he would treat his demons with respect . Using music as a way of working through them is fine but starring in a video game where the main enjoyment comes from blowing people away certainly is NOT . As I have said , there are few African American role models and he should set an example to those following behind him . While his innovative music may have made him a huge success this game smashes any credibility I feel he may have had . Third ? Well the story to the game is childish and stupid anyway . It's not even entertaining accidentally as it's just way too dull . And fourth ? Well don't get me started on the horrible targeting system and awful controls . It'll make you want to smash your control pad into your TV screen . What a horribly cheaply programmed game ! Fifth ? Well , that would have to be the bland , graphics and tedious environments . It all adds up to a pretty ( read VERY ) unsatisfying experience . Mere days after being released most stores had zillions of copies traded in as those foolish enough to buy it blind quickly discovered what a rotten game it is as well as a hideously over-indulgent and grossly misjudged vanity piece .

564633	102816	164114	1.0	Terrible , terrible movie	Out of all the movies I have ever seen I have only ever walked out of two . This is one of them . I saw about 40 minutes of this diabolical travesty and simply left . There are no words in any language that can aptly describe how worthless this movie is . The dialogue is the worst ever . The direction is lifeless and empty . The acting is very poor . But something about this film amazes me . . . What amazes me is that not only did FOX buy this nonsense . It isn't the fact that FOX green-lighted it and managed to get assemble a cast and director . No ! It's the fact that it actually got released . Why ? Why was this film made ? The story , for what it's worth , is old-fashioned and clichéd and totally hollow . And it's delivered in the most mundane , lifeless and amateurish way imaginable . I would rather stick my face in a fire than watch this movie again . Do NOT waste your cash unless your a fan of Sabrina the forty-something Teenage Witch .
564739	102816	465614	1.0	Horrible .	What a disgrace to Marvel ! Neither Spidey nor the X-Men come out of this with integrity left . It's seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis . Terrible graphics , worse gameplay and awful music . For what it's worth it's a platformer ( like the previous Spiderman game on the Genesis , only nowhere near as competent ) in which you play different characters but start out as Spidey himself . I honestly didn't stick around too much to play as anyone else as it really did begin so badly and I can only imagine that it got worse . Don't be like me and assume that it must be good coz Spidey is involved . It would be a total waste of money . I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad , bad game . Stay away !
564180	102816	348836	1.0	Gothikless	This film does not provoke a Gothic atmosphere . No , not at all . More like a sterile , monochrome and lifeless . So I'm afraid the title is a complete and utter lie . As a horror film this is a total potboiler . As a Dark Castle production it's the worst yet . Why on earth would a freshly won Oscar-winning actress do such drek ? The story is the most predictable and boring ever . You can literally see all the twists and revelations coming . There are also gaping holes in the logic . Such as if the ghost of Rachel can have a physical effect on the real world , then why would she need Miranda at all ? Well there wouldn't be a film if the director realized this . But then again , that would be a good thing . A complete waste of time ! Zemeckis and Silver should know better . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . There are extras but I don't care .
563905	102816	207201	1.0	Not good !	I didn't expect much from this movie and ' much ' is something that we do not get . I was kind of interested by the trailer at the concept of mind reading but like UNBREAKABLE there is not enough of it . The plot is schmaltzy and clichéd and is presented in the most boring and unoriginal way . Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall , an executive at an advertising company ( lead characters in these type of comedies are always high-fliers , think of Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail , Tim Robbins in Nothing To Lose , Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights or even Nic Cage in Family Man ) who is very male-chauvinistic and is generally disliked by women . Then one night he is electrocuted in the bath while wearing panties and make-up , he wakes up the next morning with the ability to hear women's thoughts . This could have been cool but in a 127 minute movie ( overlong ) there is a window of about 40 minutes in which Mel is able to read minds and only 10 minutes of that is devoted to actually doing it . What a waste , it turns the movie into a totally pointless experience . If it had been different , if the main characters were younger , didn't have the clichéd ' high-flier ' jobs or if the plot had more on it's mind than a man and a woman falling in love there could have been a cool movie here . Even the photography is bad , too many shades of brown and most of the picture out of focus with exception for the actors . Marisa Tomei is criminally underused . She is shunted into a sidecar role that fades further away as the movie progresses more and more into schmaltzy cliché . I know there are crappy sub-plots about Nick's estranged daughter ( clichéd ) and his attempts to abuse his ' powers ' to better himself at work but these are really just there to boost the ' man and woman falling in love ' story . Let's be honest , how many movies are out there are about a man and woman falling in love ? Too many . Do we need any more ? No . But because Mel is in it WWW has become a success . If David Schwimmer played Nick Marshall ? ?
564451	102816	181299	1.0	Worst FX Ever !	After starring in a movie such as Vampires one would expect Thomas Ian Griffith to not make a movie like this . It's about an evil company that builds an oil pipeline thru a snowy mountain town and causes an avalanche when it goes haywire . The avalanche FX and the terribly interwoven stock footage are the worst I've ever seen . You'll have a hot seeing how awful it is and how anyone involved with the film could allow them to be so poor . See this on TV like I did . Don't rent it . It's seriously bad .
564080	102816	800199	1.0	Racism in disguise	The very first words uttered in this TV movie are ' Almost every bad thing that has ever happened to me has been because of a black person . ' A rather alarming opening line and it doesn't let up . Joseph is a teacher at school in London in which 70 % of the kids are black . He knows it's tough for black kids to get a start in life so he tries his hardest to make men out of them . But there is one really nasty kid who lies about Joseph hitting him for a joke . But his mum gets behind it and Joseph is eventually fired for nothing . He tries to fight back but is made a scapegoat for the anger of the black community and his credibility and life are shattered . Living on the streets he is taken in by a kindly elderly black woman and begins his long haul back to respectability again . Along the way he is constantly talking to the camera about how ridiculous and annoying black stereotypes and culture are . If this were a white guy he'd be hung by the PC police , so I'm assuming that the disguise for this blatant xenophobia is the fact that Joseph is a black person too . But you really have to wonder of where exactly the inspiration for this rubbish came from . It's really easily written and has about as much grace and civility as a sledgehammer to the balls . Originally called ' Fck Black People ' I'm amazed any non-KKK member producer even dared to pick it up . Certainly not a film you should devote any amount of time to .
564836	102816	120768	2.0	Contrived , predictable nonsense	BORING ! That's what I shouted aloud when the credits finally began to roll . My buddy fell asleep 3 times throughout this film and he even managed to stay awake throughout Sense and Sensibility . Don't get me wrong . I like intelligence in my action movies but this film was just so over-hyped and incoherent it was appalling . The story was contrived to the Nth degree and it had a very TV-movie feel to it . F . Gary Gray is not a good director at all and will never amount to anything more than pedestrian . I honestly don't know why people like this clichéd rubbish so much . Don't let the opinion of others influence decision of whether or not to watch this trash . But if you hate it , remember what I told you .
563970	102816	465894	2.0	Amateur indeed !	This is quite possibly one of the most dullest pornos I have ever seen . The basic premise involves four girls and two guys in a living room ( with a video player and videos ! ) and then a bedroom doing a small amount of boring sexual acts . All four women are shaven ravers but the only attractive one of them all is Donna Ibbotson . Both she and Nichola Holt are the only 2 that do anal , but it's short and lackluster . They also both try DP but it lasts for about 2 seconds before one of or both guys get a case of the flopsies . What the main problem boils down is a case of too many girls and not enough guys and not a decent amount of space to accommodate them . The photography badly captures the action and it takes ages for anything good to happen . A little skill in the editing suite to cut out any boring bits would have been welcome and if the constant dullness doesn't annoy you then the girls laughing more than moaning will . One of the worst porn DVDs ever made .
564161	102816	60838	3.0	Pretty weak cartoon	In this short , the Pink Panther is just relaxing in his house when a mouse appears from his hole in the wall and helps himself to the fridge . A call to the exterminator ( one of the cartoon's few laughs ) proves to be fruitless as does any futile pursuit of the rodents . Many unfunny things follow until Pinky discovers a convenient book in his library called ' How to catch Mice ' . It instructs him to dress up as a cat ( even though Panthers are cats ) to scare them away . It works , but he is then chased by dogs . Not really that funny and rather misjudged as we've seen ' cat and mouse ' action a hundred times before with Tom and Jerry .
564602	102816	220506	3.0	Waste of time !	Even though most of them are rubbish , the Halloween movies always seem so full of potential when the lights go down and the film fades in to that ominous and slicker-than-crude-oil theme tune . Sadly though , they never attempt anything other than stabbings . John Carpenter's original low-budget horror flick , about a babysitter stalked by the bogey man , was a big hit that brought him much acclaim . A sequel was inevitable . Carpenter even worked on it . But after that , he bowed out and his producer Moustapha Akkad took over . He's not a filmmaker , he's a businessman . And for 24 years , he has served us the same sandwich , over and over . Rick Rosenthal , who directed Halloween II , is back behind the camera . One would assume that his familiarity with the franchise is a good thing . Too bad he's obsessed with cheesy lighting , obnoxiously loud sound effects and confusing editing . This film was supposed to be released in the autumn of 2001 , but apparently there were major differences of opinion when the director of H20 , Steve Miner , started fiddling with the finished print . The original title , Halloween : The Homecoming , was dropped because Dimension Films wanted a title that made it clear that Michael Myers was still alive . So they nicked half the title off an Alien movie and stuck it on . There is only one way to tell a story of teenagers being murdered by a psycho in a William Shatner mask / hockey mask / pillow case . And you've seen it a zillion times . The only minuscule difference this one offers is that the whole thing in broadcast on the Internet , which provides room for some gimmicky , if annoying , set pieces and a few clever tricks . But don't expect jaw-dropping twists , or intensity . An ambitious reality show producer ( Busta Rhymes ) sets up the Myers house with booby-traps and red herrings to juice his sleepover Internet show . A handful of teens , with stereotypical personalities , fall for it and deliver the goods . Until Mikey comes back , that is . What's that you say ? Surely , Mikey can't be alive after Jamie Lee lopped his head off in H20 ? Well , the movie says that Michael stuck his mask onto someone else before being chucked into the back of the corpse-mobile . Umm . . . so where's the actual " resurrection " ? What follows is a shlocky assortment of teenage slayings - Freddy , Mikey and Jason must surely have laid waste to most of teen America by now - and massacres . What motivates Mikey ? Never revealed , man . Carpenter used this to good effect first time round . Parts 4 , 5 and 6 - they dropped the roman numerals after III - added truckloads of story to the Michael Myers myth , which , although nothing but hokum , was at least interesting . H20 completely disregarded those movies and went back to killing for no reason . And now once again , it's just pointless bloodshed . Mikey isn't scary . Jason would flatten him in a second . You know that he's always going to get up after being hung , shot , stabbed , poisoned , fired out of a cannon or run over with a steam roller . There is zero suspense . Watching a rubber dog-doo machine make rubber dog-doo is not interesting . And watching a killing machine kill got boring well over a decade ago . It's time to try something new . Halloween : Resurrection tries a little harder , perhaps . And for this reason , it's one of the better sequels . But it's still a big jive turkey in need of a valuable lesson . Horror films should offend and disgust , not regurgitate the failures of previous sequels .
564555	102816	35120	4.0	Pay your taxes !	I didn't quite get this cartoon as the tax system in this country is very , very different from that in America . It appears that if Donald Duck pays his taxes early then somehow it will give the American government a better chance at winning WWII . This Donald does with worrying eagerness . So much so he races across the country with the envelope in his hand instead of relying on the postal system ( do you blame him ? ) . Nothing much else of interest . It does say on a tax form though , that Donald has adopted his nephews Huey , Duey and Luey . This I never knew . It was also up from an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject .
564139	102816	295297	4.0	Quite boring !	One might imagine that because Chris Columbus pulled off a faithful , yet exciting , movie adaptation of the first Harry Potter adventure that he would be able to it a second time . I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not . There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it . More than two-and-a-half hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium - only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained . The story has a slightly harder tone than the first , but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age . Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays . He longs to go back to Hogwarts , but a Jar-Jar Binks lookalike elf , called Dobby , turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there . It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry , as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer . Once Harry gets to school - by means of a flying Ford Anglia - his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil . Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can . And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh , totally miscast ) , who is not as funny as in the book . Five minutes after we are re-introduced to the students and teachers , the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting . First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids . But there's no excusing it now . They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong - I know , I know , they're only kids . Trust me , none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon , which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch . Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris , Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith - Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused - they cannot handle the weight of the material . Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice . Steven Kloves ' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J . K . Rowling's book - once again , Rik Mayall is completely left out - in order to keep a tight pace . Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring . Nothing REALLY happens . And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes - an absolute crime in a film of this length . With the exception of the chamber of secrets - which holds precious few secrets , I might add - no part of Hogwarts is explored . Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle . The lighting is conveniently yellow-candlelit , when he wants it to be mysterious , or comfortable , and green , or blue , when it should be menacing . Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before . There's nothing visually disturbing , but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame , family friendly blockbuster . Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown , there is nothing of interest . The mystery is very weak and straight-forward . There is too much talk and not enough action . It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series , which has so far been equally as dull . All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here . Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end . This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style , to force the audience to cry ( Home Alone , Bicentennial Man ) .
564598	102816	390615	4.0	What the hell ?	Um . . . I'm not quite sure how I should describe this film , before telling you what I think . It's not a film about war , or even anything related to war . I'm not sure where this comes from . Early on , one of the narrators , a young boy , claims the world has ended . If so , one can only assume by a war of some kind . But , if the world has ended , how come people are still walking around ? Why is there traffic on the roads ? I am confused ! ! ! Shot in black-and-white on a hand cranked camera - how rebellious and cool , I might add - the film lingers and breezes around what appears to be dilapidated , backwoods , hillbilly towns in the middle of nowhere . Think of the location for Wrong Turn . Nothing much is going on . There is an ancient radio , constantly playing an over-the-top evangelist , a boy and his dog mucking around in the er . . . muck , an alcoholic priest who likes to eat and some bearded junkyard guy who wants to blow his brain out . There is hardly any dialogue , only narration . Much of the sound is from archival and stock recordings . The gritty , flickering , b & w picture looks real cool , but it doesn't capture anything of interest . There is no plot , only a succession of unconnected scenes taped together . " This is the world after the end of the world , acre by acre , fence by fence , the war is lost " is the tagline . I have no clue as to what it means . Me and most of the audience were lost in a very strange world , with no idea what the hell was going on . Ordinarily I would give a film like this a rating . But there's something about the raw edge and dream like quality that makes me give it instead . In an ideal world , I would love to make some kind of weirdo thingy like this and I adore the fact that it was shot on a hand-cranked camera . I've never seen a movie made with something like that . I feel even cooler than usual now . And that's mighty cool indeed .
564371	102816	143145	4.0	No excitement	Probably the least exciting Bond movie ever made and that's including the Lazenby one . Nothing happens that is worth mentioning . There's a scene with a pipe or something that is good for about 2 seconds . The rest is an unbroken succession of bore after bore after bore . How on earth the filmmakers thought that audiences would be entertained by this is a mystery to me . Robert Carlyle is so unscary he belongs in Sesame Street . Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist ( ! ) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat . Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible . Watch this movie only if you are a Bond fan . If you watch them just like any other movie though . . . do NOT waste your cash .
564226	102816	408816	4.0	A waste of a license	Ghostbusters II was a pretty average movie and not a good video game . I got this for my Commodore 64 way back in 1989 . And I paid full price for it too ( a whopping £9 . 99 ) and it came in one of those over-sized cardboard boxes . It looked like it should have been great . It wasn't . Basically , there were 4 levels , all with different gameplay . Which would have been fine if the first level were not so bloody hard . Remember that scene in the movie where Ray got lowered deep into the sewers and discovered a river of slime ? Well it's that scene that makes the first level . You control Ray as he descends , trying to avoid big hands coming out of the walls and other little nasties . If they got too close the rope snapped and you fell into oblivion . It was too hard . The rope always snapped . Luckily though I figured out a cheat and managed to play the other 3 levels in which you played the Statue of Liberty as it stomped through New York and took on Vigo inside the museum . But nothing seemed to ease my anger at the difficulty of the first level . Not a good game and certainly not one I would rush out to buy . The graphics and gameplay were at their best on the Amiga and DOS versions of this game if you simply must though . Graphics C Sound C Gameplay C Lasting Appeal
564775	102816	133093	4.0	Not THAT original	I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off . It's a mix of many different films put together with important parts stolen from the Terminator ( robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity ) , Total Recall ( futuristic ' Is it a dream or reality ' sci-fi ) and even Johnny Mnemonic ( futuristic cyberpunk genre starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and ' go into them ' ) , plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime . It does deliver a lot of potential ( that the sequels failed to honor ) and has been influential on post-modern action but no matter how much I know The Matrix is loved I just can't get over the fact that I've seen most of it in other movies . It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story . It won 4 technical Academy Awards , proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy . Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very , very popular cult movie . A contradiction in terms yes , but still the most appropriate way of describing it . I only bought this DVD because it was super-cheap and came in a new purple keep-case instead of the flimsy old snappers . The DVD is in 2 . 40 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and has Dolby 5 . 1 sound .
564197	102816	466009	4.0	Yaaaaaaawn !	I would say that video games don't come much simpler than this bore but the likes of Pong and Pac-Man , while less technically sophisticated are still better . Golden Axe 2 is such a chore to play with no fun or enjoyment injected into the proceedings whatsoever . Again , you can choose from barbarian Ax Battler , amazonian Tyris Flare or dwarf Gillius Thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom , hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies ( who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity ) before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsense . I often associate Golden Axe with Streets of Rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar ( I also bought them on the same day back in March 1993 ) . But while the SOR series only got better and more sophisticated I am afraid that Golden Axe just got crapper . It tries to be the gaming equivalent of a big budget Conan movie but comes off as no more than a Roger Corman mini-series . You've never played a game so stripped down and bland as this . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal FPros : It's a lot like Golden AxeCons : It's a LOT like Golden AxeSound effects are no more than white noise . Baddies all look the same . No point system . Very , very little in the way of power ups . No combo moves . Collision detection is poor . Music is just ghastly .
564069	102816	36680	4.0	A distinct lack of laughs .	In this cartoon the Three Bears sit at the dinner table in their ramshackle hut and think of a way to temp some unwitting fool into the cauldron . That unwitting fool ends up being Bugs Bunny . But , as usual , he's to clever to fall for any tricks . Too bad the outsmarting isn't really so funny or clever . It definitely wasn't the funniest Bugs I've ever seen . I was kind of bored with it very quickly as the start is also kind of slow and humor is not up to scratch . Plus the animation of the Three Bears looks kind of rough and ragged and really distracts your attention . Don't bother going out your way to catch this ' un .
564320	102816	133751	4.0	Rather bland and mediocre	It was hardly revolutionary , I mean its only saving grace was its ensemble cast . I think Famke Jansen is totally hot and Clea Duvall especially , she's just totally gorgeous . Not enough gore either . In , fact there's not much else to The Faculty . The cheap CGI effects were pretty crap and the post-Scream script by over-celebrated writer Kevin Williamson is too self-aware and modern to be effective . In a few years , this kind of thing is going to seem dated . I guess it was entertaining in a silly kind of way which it was supposed to be but it could have been a LOT better . Not the kind of film I would watch again .
564282	102816	289043	4.0	Failed Potential	With the exception of the opening 10 minutes , 28 Days Later fails completely . The scenes of the Jim ( Cillian Murphy ) walking around an abandoned , completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving . The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie . As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost . Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification . When the survivors leave London and are ' rescued ' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense . I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this . What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused . There are hardly any ' zombies ' in this movie . Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking ( even within the morally bankrupt army ) becomes annoying . It did appreciate the raw-looking photography , it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do . Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic . I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough . Mainly , 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting , awkward characters , a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it . Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again . The DVD is in 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . Extras include a commentary , documentary and deleted scenes . The cut scenes ( and alternate ending ) are worthless and not interesting . For a superior and more exciting zombie movie wait for the new Dawn of the Dead to hit DVD . In the meantime , rent this one .
564862	102816	830515	4.0	I guess I'll die another day	What a big step-down QoS is . If you are expecting the Godfather Part II or a film equal to The Dark Knight you are in for a huge disappointment . Despite being the highest budgeted Bond film ever ( just where all the money went is beyond me ) , QoS is half-hearted and extremely simple . Of all the Bond films in history I've never seen one as straight-forward as this . As a direct sequel to Casino Royale the film drops pretty much ALL plot and focuses on action . What little story there is , almost the same story from A View to a Kill ( which was actually a carbon copy of Goldfinger ) , is nothing more than a weak excuse to string together a bunch of action scenes that feel more like alternate Jason Bourne fights rather than a Bond film . There's no mystery , no puzzle-solving and nothing resembling dangerous espionage . The 105-minute running time cripples QoS . Don't get me wrong , I hate films that are padded with dead weight , but QoS just feels too light and too hurried . Daniel Craig handles the action well , but is thoroughly un-engaging when it comes to the emotional scenes . I don't like his interpretation of Bond and I am sick to death of all these ' tragic action heroes ' that are so damn common these days . I'm also sick of guns as an extension of manhood , which QoS has a lot of . The British press made a big hoo-hah over Gemma Arterton being cast as a Bond Girl ( a term that I really don't like ) , but I swear she's in it for about five minutes and has about ten lines of dialogue before she meets a strange end in an obscure Goldfinger reference . On the plus side , David Arnold delivers his best Bond score to date , it's just a shame it didn't have a better movie to provide the images to his sounds . Bond should call it a day . He's been in the movies for close to 50 years and , in my opinion , he's had too many restarts , too many women and too many missions . Bond is a dinosaur and completely out of place in the modern world . Despite attempts at making him relevant and contemporary , I feel that his time is up and that he should step aside for a new hero . Just not a ' tragic ' one .
564766	102816	475592	5.0	More like Plastic Axe	I was dreading playing this game after suffering the unspeakably awful Golden Axe 2 . Honestly , I have played few video games that made me want to hurl my console out the window but the first sequel to Golden Axe brought me very close . Originally not released outside of Japan , Golden Axe three offers a bit more in the way of gameplay by introducing unlockable characters and a non-linear route to final boss . The graphics are merely adequate , not pushing the Mega Drive potential in the slightest . The backgrounds are mainly bland and generic but not to the point of being distracting , if that makes sense . There are only about five character models for the villains and about two different ( and rubbish ) music tracks . The sound effects suck , the combat is painfully limited and the character magic is utterly unimpressive . Despite all this , I didn't feel like turning it off in disgust and stuck with it until the end . I had fun , not lots of fun , but still felt like I had played a semi-decent game . Skip Golden Axe 2 and go straight to this one .
564176	102816	27962	5.0	Awful Opera	Eesh , if I were making an Opera I would NOT cast a hen as the fat lady . Sorry . She's just awful , that noise . . . ugh ! I think Disney should have realized her singing would have put people off ! The 1 minute shot of her just singing was too much to bear . As usual for a Disney cartoon , calamity is not far behind . Backstage Pluto is being tormented by rabbits in a top hat , conductor Mickey is desperately trying to keep the Opera from falling apart and Donald has trouble with his acting skills and prodding stuff with his sword prop . The audience gets a fair chuckle as everything goes badly . And the cartoon ends on an abrupt note , as many Disney toons do . Mildly funny .
564315	102816	82495	5.0	Already falling into tedium	When it comes to keeping a consistent plot the Halloween series has been the absolute worst . 1 and 2 follow each other okay , 3 is the joker in the pack , Return , Revenge and Curse were nothing but gibberish and H20 and Resurrection have been poor ' post-modern ' exercises in convention merely using the Halloween name . Right after the original Halloween ended , Laurie is taken away to get stitched up , but Michael Myers ain't quite dead yet . Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very , very slowly goes about his killing machine business . Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange , offbeat way . No one listens to him , of course and they end up dead . It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness . The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again ? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obsolete today . But it does have one purpose : to always look good when compared to the drek of ' horror ' we suffer today . This first sequel , coming a mere three years after the original , already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point . There's no purity or class here . Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered . What happened to Jimmy ? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later ? What ? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers ( Age 23 ) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock ? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter ( which he does again in Revenge ) ? This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper . The sound is in not-bad-for-its-day Dolby Stereo . There are no features to speak of , which is annoying since Universal originally promised us commentaries , documentaries , deleted scenes etc . Pick it up cheap .
564566	102816	48649	5.0	I HATE Speedy Gonzales	Man , I hope I'm in the majority here . But I gotta be honest , this mouse is so highly , extremely irritating . Does he ever shut up ? Not only that but the whole character is kind of xenophobic and un-PC . Now I am certainly NOT one for being PC but I still find Speedy kinda offensive . In this cartoon he asked by his Mexican mouse pals to cross the border into America in bring them back cheese as they are all starving . Is there subtext here or am I reading too much into it ? Sylvester is there to stop him . Or at least try . The usual Cat and Mouse hijinks follow . It's not really funny and I'm amazed it actually got an Academy Award .
564046	102816	370082	5.0	A significant lack of scares .	Wishing Stairs is the least scary of the Yeogo Goedam films so far ( I've still to see the fourth however ) . It's just the same old clichés of ' be careful what you wish for ' done in a South Korean girls school . It's like Wishmaster gone Asian with a bit of Grange Hill thrown in for abstract measure . The windy atmosphere is don again , the lesbian love thing is done AGAIN and the old , dusty secret room is done again too . In fact , when I think about it , this movie is nothing more than some rehashed scenes from the first two . It's not boring in any way , but is certainly not scary and not a film I could sit through again .
564370	102816	133412	5.0	Middle of the Road	The only reason I watched this is because my girlfriend threatened me to . This is movie is sooo desperate to be a post modern crime thriller that it looks and feels so relentlessly superficial . Most scenes are decked out in unpleasant pastel colors and interiors are always lit with warm lights . It's nice to look at but has a student filmmaking feel to it that distracts me . Something else that is quite unreal is the scene in which Nivola and Witherspoon discuss their forthcoming crime . . . on a roof in front of a neon sign on a sofa . Yeah . . . like people keep sofas on roofs in front of neon signs . This was obviously an attempt by the director to add a little sparkle to an otherwise BORING scene . Which is also the reason he throws in some cliched camera angles . It's a " film noir " you see . . . so diagonal shots on an ordinary scene are standard . Composer Craig Armstrong was obviously hired at the last minute when the director heard the score for Romeo and Juliet to provide a superficial ( that word again ) soundtrack . It sounds like it belongs in a totally different movie . But perhaps this is a good thing . There isn't much theme but the music does evoke some weird feelings from us . Much like the feelings the characters have . It's cool and I wish more scores were this way . The " twist " wasn't too obvious to me . Once it occurs it takes away all the tension and stress right away and will relieve you big time . It even manages to change the tone of the whole movie to light-hearted . In case your wondering my girlfriend lists this as number 2 in her top 3 movies . Number 1 is Devils Advocate and 3 is Moonwalker . . . ugh !
563850	102816	82763	5.0	Just . . . weird	I never really got into this movie , it's more strange than it is funny . And Chevy wasn't his usual self either , he was way to morose and distant to really side with his character or empathise with him in any way . Chevy plays Max Fielder , an air-traffic controller who's life is constantly in the toilet and bad luck follows him everywhere . He's very paranoid and possessive over his girlfriend , so much so that she dumps him for some total dork . On his way home from a disastrous night out his car is sprayed with radioactive gunk from a leaky government truck . He is soon blessed / cursed with telekinetic abilities , which he uses to get revenge on those who make his life miserable . It could have been really fun but it's just . . . weird . Ken Shapiro ( who ? ) does not have the same edge in his direction as Harold Ramis , Michael Ritchie or John Landis and he doesn't know how to fully use Chevy's brand of humor . There are some laughs to be had though , but their not so memorable . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen but it's mostly all shot in soft focus so there's nothing outstanding here . The sound is plain old Mono and it's alright if nothing else , though the dialogue has very heavy use of ADR . A trailer and TV spot are included . Oh . . . and that theme song playing over the menu , opening and closing credits ? Yuck !
564626	102816	109040	6.0	Funny , but lacking in plot	This is the movie that really kick-started the careers of Jim Carrey and , to a lesser extent , Courteney Cox although it is Carrey who makes this movie all his own by his wild and energetic performance as a half-insane Pet Detective . In case you're wondering that's a detective who tracks down missing animals . Ace is a great character , with his wacky clothes , groovy swagger , wild hair ( LOVE that do ) and unpredictable behaviour . He's a page right out of Howlin ' Mad Murdock's biography . Courteney Cox plays a boss for the Miami Dolphins who hires Ace to find their missing cetacean mascot Snowflake . They can't play without having their mascot y ' know . It's paper thin and despite lasting about 85 minutes , it is stretched too far . What could have been a half decent plot soon descends into lame-brain juvenile humor as Ace does his class clown bit , offends many people and uncovers stupid and unfunny ' plot ' twists . Tom Shadyac tries his best to make the film look colorful and vivid and , for the most part , succeeds but sometimes the production design looks a bit shoddy and I have no idea who allowed Sean Young to be in this movie . She's a terrible actress and makes every scene damn painful to watch . However , she is quite a MILF these days . Not in this movie though . There are some funny scenes and easy to see why Carrey went on to become such a big star but compared to the rest of Carrey's career it's a bit of an insult to his talent . I prefer the sequel , even though Ace is a full blown lunatic in it and appears a tiny bit more normal and human in this one . A fun movie to watch once in a long while . Not something to rely on for never-ending appeal .
564801	102816	90098	6.0	Feels like something's been cut out	At 86 minutes and half a dozen subplots not being wrapped up or developed in any way at all . For example the subplot involving John Laroquette is never given the chance to become anything . His whole presence in the movie is totally pointless and I suspect there was a whole ' Candy's wife may be cheating on him ' plot that was cut out because it just too similar Chase / D'Angelo in Vacation . We never know what happens to Richard Crenna or Rip Torn after the Regatta and we never know how the rest of the Summer Rental went . It's like the writers knew there was no plot , chucked in this Regatta crap and thought that would be a good place to end the film when it's over . And what was wrong with the popcorn Candy and Crenna eat ? I found that pretty weird . Although I have already made comparisons to Vacation I still feel like this film is good enough without being a copycat movie . It's seems more realistic and doesn't have any slapstick humor . Candy feels more like a real guy who needs a real vacation . We want him to relax but still can't help laughing when everything goes wrong . My fave scene is when he returns home to find it transformed into some kind of free-for-all Funhouse . But for a film set in Florida there is a huge lack of nice scenery and the photography isn't so cool . I wonder why Kerri Green ( who starred in The Goonies the same year ) never made another mainstream movie tho . Joey Laurence did so why not her ? If you like comedies , but hate the scatological humor that most present day comedies have , then this is a good enough escape . I miss John Candy and wish he made more movies before he died .
564083	102816	424345	6.0	Mercifully scaled down	Look , I'll be honest with you . I think that Kevin Smith is the anti-Christ . His films in recent years have been dismal . I found Dogma to be one of the worst movies ever and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was made to appeal to the lucrative stoner / Generation X market who think that films like this are ' da bomb ' . Sigh , I remember the days when people actually spoke correct English and we really need another World War to thin out their ranks a little . The aforementioned movies only make them believe it's funny to be hopeless losers that they are . It seems that Kevin Smith is incapable of writing a movie that isn't soaked in f-words or pee and fart jokes . Clerks II is NO exception , but he's reined in the stupidity and added enough real human drama to make it bearable for the rest of us . The store from the first movie has burnt down due to Randal's incompetence and he and Dante are forced to work in Mooby's , a Cow-themed fast-food restaurant with the lovely Becky ( the utterly gorgeous Rosario Dawson , who I would do 86 ways ) and Elias an ultra-Christian who seems to be an exaggerated cross between Rod AND Tod Flanders . I imagined the whole movie would be nothing more than them having inane conversations and swearing a lot while Jay and Silent Bob sell weed to the kiddies in the parking lot . And while we do get this there was , surprisingly , a bit of real story in there too . Dante is about to get married to a gorgeous woman who adores him ( but only because she has given up on the shallow , good-looking men ) and is leaving NJ forever the next day for sunny Florida . Despite the fact that their lives go nowhere , Randal really doesn't want him to go and would-be true-love Becky tries to convince him that he's fooling himself . It's the dilemma of finally being able to move on in life with a future of mock-happiness or making the most of what's right in front of you that elevates this higher than the crude JASBST and the wildly over-rated Dogma . But don't think for a minute that this film will not have extensive conversations on ass-to-mouth ( Becky likes it ! ! ! ) , comparisons of Star Wars to Lord of the Rings ( or Nerd vs Nerd in other words ) or arguments of non-racist racist words ( Porchmonkey ? Never heard of it ! ) or a man raping a donkey for the viewing pleasure of drunken idiots . And do look out for the ' Who's Your Buddy ' Jesus on Jay's T-shirt . Although he does write some good scenes and his work in comic-books is brilliant ( Bluntman and Chronic , read it ! ) I ' m still not convinced of Smith's ability as a director . One superficial and completely pointless dance number doesn't make up for the endless static shots of inside a fast-food joint , but at the very least it's slicker and more professional than Dogma , a film I will never forgive for its infinite rubbishness .
564402	102816	818506	6.0	Disappointing	I was so looking forward to this game , with the great reviews and cool-looking graphics and all . But I honestly can't see what all the fuss is about . For a start , the game is just too damn short and too damn easy with nothing much to make you continue playing . I don't buy into all this ' unlockable ' crap and the bonus stuff in New Super Mario Bros . isn't all that interesting anyway . I'm not going to waste my time doing over a level I have already completed just for the sake of unlocking a new background . Only a sad , pathetic loser would do something like that . And the so-called ' ton ' of mini-games is a bold-faced lie since most of them are the exact same ones featured on Super Mario 64 DS and only about 2 aren't . There's only about half the amount featured on SM64 DS too . So there's another wasted opportunity . Maybe it's because I played this so soon after the GBA version of SMB3 or maybe it's because it's just so damn short and never really gets going , but I was just so let down by New Super Mario Bros . The giant Mario thing is cool but it lasts for 5 seconds . I do wish the flying ability from SMB3 was featured . Or that the game was simply worth the money . Don't believe the hype . Only pick this game up cheap ! Graphics A Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564230	102816	30069	6.0	Not as funny as Caddyshack	In this cartoon Donald is out on a coastal golf course for a relaxing eighteen as his nephews caddie for him . Everything would have worked out fine if he were not so bossy . Huey , Duey and Louie play tricks on him to throw him ( such as swapping his clubs for nets and giving him phony balls ) off his game . And that's about as creative as the cartoon gets . Donald Duck cartoons are so easy to set up and seem to spend the entire eight minutes knocking down . You can tell that whatever Donald is involved in is going to end up in disaster but sometimes it can be quite inventive . This one just seems to be going through the motions . Why can't he and his nephew cooperate for a change ?
564741	102816	97814	6.0	Nice , but pointless	While I understand all of Hayao Miyazaki's work cannot be heavy , 2 hour-plus epics , this is the lamest of all his films . Don't get me wrong , I like it . But there isn't really a lot of story or character to make a feature length film out of . I watched the English dub with Kirsten Dunst doing the voice of Kiki and the late , great Phil Hartman doing her talking cat Jiji . Much like Sabrina The Late-Thirties Teenage Witch , Jiki is black , cynical and funny . He provides most of the film's laughs and is impossibly cute . As I have said , the film is very light . So light it could float in the air without the need for a broomstick . Nothing is really made a big deal of and no real story develops . What gives the film class is Miyazaki's attention to detail and gorgeous production design . Kiki exists in a perfect , transethnical European town with wonderful architecture and scenery . The flying scenes look brilliant and the colors are always bright and cheerful . Still , no-matter how pretty and easy-going , it doesn't have that long-lasting appeal of Nausicaa or Castle of Cagliostro .
564181	102816	27960	6.0	Nothing like a little gratitude eh ?	Mickey's Circus is having an ' orphans for free ' day . All of the orphans appear to be Mickey Mice . His circus ain't up to much as far as we see . All he appears to have are a bunch of dancing seals , they baby is the cutest . Though classed as a Mickey cartoon , he disappears for most of the show , leaving Donald to go crazy in that way he always does . Obviously the seals torment Donald and cause him no end of grief but why do the orphans suddenly turn on Mickey's Circus ? The pack him and Donald into the cannon and blast them off . Nothing like saying thanks huh ? There are a few laughs in this one . But not a lot . I don't like circuses .
563847	102816	303231	6.0	Eh . . . it's okay	None of the scenes in this DVD are outstanding and the girls are only above average . The first girl Layla Gates does anal and DP with Marc Davis and Lex Steele , it's an alright scene but it's not hard enough or deep enough and the good bits are blandly shot and brief . Second is Christina , ( she says she is a Devon housewife with two kids ) she takes on Mark , Lex and Omar and does anal and DP . She doesn't like it too much and it's not much of a turn on to watch . Sarah Edwards is next . Plain , boring straight sex with Mark . Kelly-Ann follows and does anal and DP with Mark and Lex , not after Mark offends her slightly with incest jokes . Penetration is not deep enough and looks exceptionally dull . A rogue fly crawling inside Kelly-Ann's vagina is the only interesting thing about the scene . Zoe Rose does the best scene with Mark , Lex and Omar , doing anal and DP , which is better than the other attempts on this DVD . But I could have done without the male rimming . The last girl is a screamer and she does anal and DP with Omar and Lex , nothing too impressive as , once more , it's not deep or hard enough . Rent it .
563830	102816	58471	6.0	So tired	The Pink Panther is worn out and tired . All he needs is a place to catch a few Z's . The only flophouse around kicks him out for some reason ( prejudiced probably ) . So old Pinky goes for a desperate wander . Soon he comes across an empty house and invites himself in . Little does he know that the owner will be back soon and is about to get the fright of his life . Tricks and hijinks follow . It's all funny stuff with the slightest bit of cleverness without being overly intelligent . The Pink Panther's coolness is in abundance in this cartoon . While not his best , it's still rather funny .
564026	102816	58150	6.0	Cheap-ass , simplistic Bond bore .	I know I'm just asking to be hauled over the coals for this , but Goldfinger is surely one of the dullest Bond films . I am not some cheeseburger junkie brought up on Die Another Day and xXx , before you make that assumption . But I found Goldfinger to be tolerable only because it was rather short for a Bond film and had a villain who was somewhat likable instead of a despicable super-arch-nemesis living in a volcano lair . Despite the fact that this film apparently cost more to make then the first two Bond films combined it is so amazingly cheap you could be fooled into thinking it they filmed it all for free . First of all , Sean Connery is obviously never outside of Pinewood Studios ( or the nearby , surrounding countryside ) since every time he appears ' on location ' it's ridiculously fake-looking rear-projection . My God , if you're going to make a spy movie in a franchise that sells itself on globe-trotting how about actually having your actor BE there ! The locations , as a result , are all low-key and not much to look at . The gold-melting plant in Geneva , for example , is blatantly an anonymous alleyway out the back of Pinewood . I was never really one for the silly gadget's in Bond film's either , so I'm glad that they never played a big part in the story and the stuff that he did use ( homing devices ) were believable . But don't get me started about the car ! Why , why , why do people always cream their panties over these inane Bond cars ? Let me tell you something ; the Aston Martin is lamest thing I have ever seen , I wouldn't be seen dead in one and it irritates the hell out of me that they keep cropping up in this series . And that's even WITH Q's cunning extras . The Goldfinger Aston Martin spawned a die-cast toy car that's worth zillions on E-Bay these days and is worth even more if you have the box ( why would you ) with the ejector seat still intact . Wow . . . the ejector seat . Such a big deal is made out of this but I swear the guy Bond launches out of his car soars a whopping one foot in the air . Adventure doesn't get any bigger than THAT huh ? Despite it's undeserved praise as a classic and a definitive Bond film , Goldfinger is clearly a rush-job with an Oddjob . This was Connery's third Bond film ( as well as others ) in two years . If they took a little more time and effort and delivered something with more sophisticated framing and effects then Goldfinger could have been worthy of being called a classic . As it is it's merely a fond childhood event for a lot of older adults who are unable to see how naff it is since they can only view it through nostalgic goggles .
564148	102816	27281	6.0	Not that funny	The typical chaos that follows Mickey and Donald everywhere provide most of the laughs in this cartoon . They're climbing the Alps and literally dragging Pluto behind them . Donald decides to mad at a little mountain goat for some reason , Mickey attempts the ridiculously evil crime of stealing an eagles eggs and Pluto ends up freezing and being rescued by one of those mountain dwelling St . Bernards with the barrel of booze ( do these really exist btw ? ) . It's 10 minutes of putting the characters through as much aggravation as possible withing their environment . A lot of Mickey / Donald cartoons are like this and this one is nothing special .
564764	102816	1190535	6.0	Should be first ' adventures '	The title is a bit of an inappropriately long mouthful and the film is clearly split into two separate halves that have nothing to do with each other . I'm not really fussed about this , as they both have enough plot and developments to keep the viewer interested . It opens with Young Indy explaining how he is no ordinary child before being shipped off around the world as his dad ( Lloyd Owen doing a very good Sean Connery impression ) goes on a lecture tour . Though his mother and private tutor don't take too kindly to his willingness to get into loads of trouble . When in Egypt Indy meets Laurence of Arabia and helps unearth a tomb in which a priceless headpiece is stolen ( this plot is never resolved but I assume it will in later instalments ) . In Morocco he is kidnapped by slave traders and makes pals with a young servant . That's it really . Nothing really involving but it is nice , light entertainment . The educational aspect of Indy meeting historical figures and learning a wide range of things from them is not in the least distracting and is actually convincing as what inspires him to be the famous archaeologist that he ends up being . A promising start , I don't why John Williams didn't allow for his theme to be used though . It was even in the video games after all . And since this is a genuine Lucasfilm production I was surprised it was not included even if it would have been a bit out of place considering the material .
564286	102816	33952	6.0	Nothing special	Outside of a cozy Xmas atmosphere and the look and feel of a lovely country Xmas , this Tom and Jerry cartoon doesn't have much going for it outside of the usual hijinks . Jerry wanders around late on Xmas Eve , nosing at all the presents . House guardian Tom , doing his duty , chases him . It ends up with Jerry being booted out into the freezing cold . Feeling guilty , Tom eventually goes out to rescue him and the two of them enjoy the warmth of the fire together . Like I said , it's nothing special and not very inventive at all . A good cartoon to view at Xmastime however .
563769	102816	455754	6.0	Way too easy !	Shadow Dancer is the story of Joe Mushashi and his faithful dog Yamoto . Together they go out and beat up the ruthless thugs of the Neo Zeed Corporation and it's boss the Union Lizard . It's a load of confusing nonsense and in the journey from Arcade to Genesis the plot seems to have been erased and events taking place in the game just seem like gobbledygook . All you really do in this game is jump around taking strange-looking villains out with Surikens . To be honest , the arcade version of Shadow Dancer was much better . The graphics were far superior , the levels were cooler ( levels such as the airport and junkyard are missing in this version ) and the bad guys less weird . Plus it's very , very short with only 5 levels all over in a few minutes . As it was such a cool arcade game it's shocking that a game so easy and tepid could end up on the Genesis . It was capable of much more than this and Shadow Dancer is really only a game for Shinobi completist .
564812	102816	279113	6.0	It's not a comedy	Even though it stars Jennifer Aniston of the thankfully canceled , obnoxious , fake sitcom Friends and it's written by Mike White , who wrote Orange County this is not a comedy movie , a romantic movie or a chick flick . More of a bleak drama with the feel of an independent movie . In some dead-end Texas town a supermarket checkout girl longs for a more exciting life , stares off into space with a disconnected look and moans a lot . In one of her stares she connects with Holden ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , a lonely , borderline insane young writer . A much needed affair breathes some life into her existence . I wasn't entirely satisfied with the film overall . There wasn't a good explanation for Justine actions and decisions in the film's climax . Who's baby is she carrying ? Why did she betray Holden ? She's not a good girl . Not by far . So I'm assuming the title is meant to be an ironic one . Anyone expecting Friends or Picture Perfect or Along Came Polly or Object of My Affection or any of the endless incarnations of Rachel Green be warned . . . it ain't that way . Probably the most mature work Jennifer Aniston has done . But there's still an incomplete feeling to it all . Worth watching with no pre-judgments .
563831	102816	59898	6.0	Still Looking	The last time we saw the Pink Panther was in Pink Pajamas , in which he was desperate for a safe , warm place to get his head down . Nothing has changed as in this cartoon he stows away in Gamble's department store for a cozy night . But the night janitor is suspicious of their uninvited guest and ends up being the butt of old Pinky's usual jokes and tricks . It's pretty funny stuff as both of them race from department to department trying out avoid and outwit each other . The Pink Panther is very cool and very cute and this is one funny cartoon . But can someone explain the title to me ?
564409	102816	59800	6.0	Not much going on here .	Thunderball may have nice locations and pretty seaside scenery but there's a shocking lack in set pieces or excitement . The evil SPECTRE organisation nicks a warplane and lands it in the ocean . Within minutes they've spirited away the nuclear warheads and are demanding a ransom or they'll blow up a major city . Sounds like Broken Arrow huh ? Well the British Government are none too happy about this so they send - 007 after them . Bond has been ' relaxing ' at some sort of health farm where the culprits just so happened to be doing evil deeds so he's already way ahead of the game . Off he goes to the Bahamas ( how come super-villains never have lairs in Liverpool or Coventry ? ) to track the missing plane down and , with any luck , get the warheads back . But not before he scuba dives about a zillion times , goes to the casino and shags loads of women . Isn't he on a time limit here ? His gadgets are not THAT fancy , the action not THAT impressive but maybe I'm guilty of double standards here . I've always thought that the latest Bond movies were guilty of being nothing but spectacle and loads of SFX . They don't feel real and are increasingly being pushed into sci-fi rather than super-spy . Sp if you've had enough of the xXx style Die Another Day , something Thunderball will balance it out . But there are better Bonds than this , though it does have some nice widescreen photography and the constant sunny seaside locations will make you want to go on holiday immediately .
564768	102816	91225	7.0	Howard , forever the Underduck	Let me tell you something about film critics . It's easy to pick faults in someone else's work , even if you do not have it in your power to create an equal work of art . The average film critic , by his very nature , is just a pretentious know-it-all who is quite frequently talking from the wrong end of his alimentary canal . When HTD came along in 1986 it was the first true victim to the pop culture critic . For 22 years it has been called ' the biggest flop of all time ' and other such terrible labels . Well , it cost $30 million dollars ( nothing compared to today's budgets ) and took $37 million worldwide and that's not even counting the higher-than-you-think rental revenue . Add it altogether and HTD is most definitely NOT the flop it is accused of being . But since it was a rather eccentric family comedy ( an easy target ) and one of the first films to significantly under-perform at the domestic box office ( George Lucas expected the returns to be astronomical ) it became a scapegoat for bad studio spending and taste . I guess that the world needs something or someone to blame when pop culture goes wrong and the jackass critics I mentioned already seized upon Howard's failings to make a name for themselves . Derogatory soundbites are easy to come up with and everyone who hated the film used some kind of duck-themed insult to put it down and make themselves feel clever . But , when you think about it , these are basically the same people who will deliberately give a bad film a great review just to see their own name on the poster ( yes , I am talking to you Paul Ross ) . The film also suffered a further bad rep when George Lucas publicly disowned the film . It's under-performance forced him to sell off a part of his company which went on to become Pixar ( think of how much he could have earned if he didn't ) and it really made him quite angry . Wouldn't you be ? Me ? I am a huge fan of the late Steve Gerber's comic-books . HTD was basically the first BIG comic-book movie and came surprisingly soon after he found success in his own series . Howard first appeared in an issue of Man-Thing and starred in a few other issues of Conan and even Spider-Man before getting his own wings in the late 70s . The comic-book stories are the most surreal , archaic and satirical I have ever read and it's a shame that they had to tone it down for the movie , but that's to be expected . As an ordinary duck working for an advertising company on his home planet of Duckworld , Howard is blasted across the universe right out of his living room by an experimental laser developed by Dr . Jenning ( Jeffrey Jones ) . He lands in Cleveland , where he meets Beverly Switzler ( Lea Thompson ) a singer who takes him under her wing . . . I mean arm . Now trapped in a world he never made the one attempt at sending him back home unleashes the forces of the Dark Overlord of the Universe on earth through the possession of Dr . Jenning and he intends to bring more of his demons through the portal . Yeah , that sounds pretty heavy . I'm actually a sucker for duck-related stuff . I don't know why . Donald Duck , Daffy Duck , Duck Tales , Darkwing Duck , Duckman etc . The list goes on and on . What I particularly like about the HTD movie is how most people seem to be completely at ease at talking to a humanoid bird . Some of the fairer critics claimed that the film might have been a bigger hit if they had used CGI or traditional animation to bring Howard to life , but I must disagree . Part of the appeal of Howard is the fact that he is actually physically there and not some ghost who has been photo-shopped in afterwards . I love the duck suit , to me it is completely convincing and Chip Zien's voice work is perfect . I'd totally love to have Howard as a pal . No joke , this film has a unfairly notorious history and a totally wrong perception by the general public or those who turned their noses and beaks up when it came out in 1986 . Clear your head of any preconceptions that you might have and enjoy it on its own level . Though we really could have done without that silly narration over the opening title .
564017	102816	33268	7.0	Deja vu	This cartoon reminded me a lot of a previous Donald short called Clock Cleaners . The same high rise / vertigo gags are used but that doesn't stop it from being funny . Donald is washing windows while Pluto down on the ground sends up fresh buckets of water . But he's to busy napping and ignores Donald when prompted with a hook to the head . Instead Donald snares a bucket of bolts ( why would a window washer have a bucket of bolts ? ) and smashes a huge pane of glass with it . But his troubles aren't over as a bee makes it his mission to sting Donald for soaking him . Despite some erection / impotence imagery at the end with the bee struggling to make a decent sting , it's amusing .
564252	102816	32470	7.0	It just never works out	Donald is another name for disaster . Why do you think Cockney rhyming slang uses Donald Duck for bad luck ? In this cartoon Donald is a Fire Chief and his nephews his staff . Being such an incompetent leader he soon sets fire to the station-house itself and cannot save it for the life of him . Whether tackling raging hoses , falling through the sky or pumping gasoline into fire Donald suffers the worst of everything as Huey , Duey and Louie duck ( pun intended ) for cover . The cartoon features some cuteness not often found in Disney shorts . I never really believed that was something he ever intended . The vivid animation always seems to be first and imaginative mayhem second . This short has all three .
564391	102816	932912	7.0	Get it for Sandra	You know the problem with buying porno DVDs is that too often you are just buying it for one scene . I guess if you could pick and choose which scenes you want to watch instead of being stuck with a bunch of girls you're not interested in it would be better . Perhaps this is why downloading specific scenes off the internet is gaining popularity . The one scene I recommend this DVD for is most definitely the last scene with Sandra Brown and her ( surprisingly large-bushed ) pal Kimberly . Sandra is such a gorgeous girl and so incredibly dirty she makes any scene arousing , even if she were just reading the bible fully dressed in frumpy clothing . Both her and Kimberly do regular sex in various positions on an outdoor sofa as well as anal ( oh , what a wonderful , wonderful ass she has ) . Sounds bland , but since it's her it's the best scene on the DVD . Please do more porn Sandy !
564796	102816	291858	7.0	Puts you right in the movie	There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike in this game . First of all it sticks very closely to the way Nakatomi Plaza looks and sounds so you feel like you really are there . The music is a lot like that in the movie and adds atmosphere . But there are only like 2 tracks ! The blood splatter effects are quite cool but shooting a bad guy is the only way to kill him . In this sense the game is VERY linear . There is absolutely no freedom . You HAVE to do what the game wants you to do . Which is really stupid considering the effort that has obviously went into crafting each and every floor of Nakatomi Plaza . There are a lot more than just 12 terrorists here . Obviously the game has to be beefed up to about 300 to make it more exciting and a few new scenarios are added ( And some stuff , like the media attention of the siege , totally ignored ) . It was also very annoying to see the FBI Chopper STILL flying around after the roof has blown up . I guess this was just a cheap way to avoid a cinematic . The voice acting is also rather poor . It makes the cinematics hard to watch sometimes . And what's the point of having a CB radio ( a cunning excuse to plug a certain product ) when it is only used during cinematics and NEVER when you want . In the ancient Die Hard Trilogy you got lots of weapons . But in this all you get is the ordinary gun , some flash grenades and 4 machine guns . The best of which are sparsely featured in the later levels . You can't even get into fist fights . So the fight with Karl is non-existent . All you do is shoot him . Wow ! And chances for really cool stuff have been ignored . How cool would it be to chuck bad guys thru the windows or off the roof or down the lift shafts ? Doesn't happen . Even you jump off the roof yourself it just cuts to ' game over ' . But the worst thing is the ending . It's nothing like the movie , boring and dull . It takes a lot of patience to get thru and then . . . nothing happens . A cheap , tiny cinematic follows and the game returns to the title screen . Come on ! That's it ? By only if you are a fan of the movie . For the casual gamer this is dated stuff .
564867	102816	42613	7.0	I ain't lion	Tom is listening to smooth jazz on the radio when the tunes are interrupted by an announcement claiming that a lion has escaped from the circus . Freaking out , Tom slams shut every window and makes a barricade in the corner where he arms himself with a rifle . Meanwhile , in the basement , Jerry finds the lion hiding in the shadows . He's desperate to get back to Africa as he hates life at the circus . Jerry agrees to help him , but the lion needs a bite to eat . The joke of the cartoon is that Tom never actually sees the lion , believing that the one foiling him during every attack is Jerry . There's a few good visual jokes and it's one of the better shorts , if forgettable in the long run .
564646	102816	443453	7.0	You must see this movie-film . . . so my country can be free .	Borat is sent to America with producer Azamat Bagatov to brush with American culture and help Kazakhstan move forward in the 21st Century . While there , he goes renegade and tries to hunt down Pamela Anderson for a quick marriage ( with his ' wedding sack ' ) after his wife Oksana is killed by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo . I will admit that this film is frequently hilarious , but it's not as good as I thought it could be . Sacha Baron Cohen recycles a lot of jokes and situations from the TV show . I've seen every Borat sketch that has been made available to the public and the easy targets are beginning to not be as shocking or entertaining as they once were . He aims all of his material at the idiots who fall for it or who have not seen him on TV . Bringing a ( fake ) hooker to a snooty High Society dinner , boozing with moronic college frat-boys or jive-talking to a stuck-up concierge is not intelligent comedy anymore . His method of exposing bigots , hypocrites and narrow-minded idiots with his special blend of Socratic irony and entrapment has been used to great effect in the past but it's getting old . Since this movie is probably the last we will see of Borat it's a shame he didn't come up with a new edge . Sacha Baron Cohen must have the biggest balls in the whole world to do what he does though . I could never keep a straight face while pretending to interrogate a yard sale lady / gypsy over a Barbie doll / woman she has shrunk . Nor could I deliberately , over-exaggerate a massive fall into priceless antiques in a store and not pay for it . There is one particular scene that pushes the boundaries of taste so far back that it could circle Pluto several times over . I will mention nothing of the content of this scene but I have to warn you , it is insane , teeth-grindingly funny and absolutely disgusting . You need to see it to believe it . Obviously there are some parts to this film that are totally staged but if you try to figure it out , Sacha Baron Cohen has to tried to make it as little-faked as possible and you'll realize how it's all done . Of particular note is the surprisingly emotional musical score to the film which really stood out and made an impression . Strange considering the type of film that it is . I must hunt down the CD . No one will fall for Borat's schtick anymore . This movie will make him too popular . He goes out with a predictable BANG instead of KABOOM !
563898	102816	189998	7.0	Big movie on a small budget	I cannot believe that for a film made for 8 million dollars you get a million times the movie that Battlefield Earth was . Ironic ? No , just good film-making . If Willem Dafoe doesn't win an Oscar for this on the 25th of this month then there is no justice . The photography is outstanding . The music is creepy and atmospheric and the setting is both original and photogenic . The cast was also perfect , I never quite liked Eddie Izzard until this and John Malkovich was effortlessly impressive as the eccentric German filmmaker Wilhelm Frederich Murneu . I really do wonder how much of this film was true . I wish people would realise that not all Hollywood films are bad and not all independent films are good . All movies have to be are well made , well written and well acted . And Shadow of the Vampire has all 3 of those qualities . I very much recommend this movie to you and suggest that you see it on the big screen . But if you don't you gotta get the DVD . And just a word of trivia ? ' Yes Nicolas Cage is the producer ' . When I saw this in the cinema the rest of the audience said , one by one , ' Hey Nicolas Cage ' when his credit appeared . It was like a never-ending echo .
564518	102816	120910	7.0	Pretty good , but I wish it was longer .	Top quality animation and a sense of humour make this sequel / add-on a formidable animated movie in its own right . The running time of 74 minutes is a bit of a let-down . I would have liked to have seen more pieces and more imagination . And be warned , The Sorcerer's Apprentice remains . As this was the original's ONLY real selling point they decided to stick it back in there , so you're really only get just over an hours worth of new footage . Which feels like a bit of a rip-off . But my favorite segment is the one with Donald Duck , in fact they were all cool , especially the one with the volcano . The music matches the story perfectly and it has some truly beautiful animation . Far superior to those ugly CGI crap we get these days . And the TV show style introductions were more watchable than the dubbed Deems Taylor segments in the original . This was the first animated movie to be made for IMAX screens and the digital picture is amazing . See this preferably on an IMAX screen or on DVD . Watching it on VHS would only insult the brilliant animation . It's sad that Disney has abandoned traditional hand-drawn animation for theatrical projects . It's what the studio was built on after all . But Disney is shadow of its former self , we all know that . Just as good as the original Fantasia , but loses points for not being longer and more ambitious .
564144	102816	69113	7.0	Sometimes , if you wanna go up , you have to go down .	It may not seem like anything particularly new these days , especially after the revival of disaster films in the late 90s . But in 1972 , The Poseidon Adventure was a somewhat groundbreaking film . But we're used to a group of survivors fighting against floods , earthquakes , storms , sinking vessels , zombies , volcanoes etc so you have to keep this in mind when watching it . Taken from Paul Gallico's novel ( who himself was one a ship that almost capsized ) the film features an all-star cast ( though young viewers will probably not recognize a single one of them save Gene Hackman or Leslie Nielsen ) with 7 Academy Awards between them . Surely , the bigger the stars have a bigger chance of survival ! Not so ! A capsized ship has many different ways of killing you as our unfortunate stars learn . . . the hard way . None of it is particularly graphic but there is a lot of tension and claustrophobia that makes it work . And the sets are quite impressive , if a little dated . When the Poseidon flips over it's already an ancient ship heading for the scrapyard . It would have been better if they destroyed something brand new and pretty , but I guess that means it wouldn't be so dirty and menacing when upside-down and full of salt-water . Followed by a sequel in 1979 and a new version in 2006 , TPA has become famous as the film that started the disaster genre and Irwin Allen as its creator . Truth be told , Allen only ever directed 2 ( and a bit ) of these movies and produced a couple more . I guess it's because TPA made such an impression that his name was linked to disaster movies he wasn't even involved with . Strange though to think that Gene Hackman hated making the movie and has apparently , to this day , refused to watch it . Much like Ed Harris in the Abyss . I guess some bald actors should just stay out of the water .
564408	102816	103772	7.0	Well remembered , but not a classic	At the time , Basic Instinct was considered shocking and new . In retrospect , in a world where much harder pornography is so commonplace , it's not got much sex appeal going for it . What I do like is the OTT game of cat and mouse between Stone and Douglas . Catherine Tramell is a writer of sleazy novels who lives out her pulp trash after she's written it . This would be fine if she wrote about saving the children or building churches but Tramell writes about sex , murder and betrayal . She's accused of murdering her Rock-star boyfriend by icepicking his head 86-times during a massive shagathon . She feels no guilt and no sadness and Detective Nick Curran regards her with utmost suspicion even though she passed a lie-detector test . Determined to find the truth among Catherine Tramell's web of pork-pies , Curran falls into her world of sin and seduction . Already a bad cop well on the way to cleaning up his act , all of his nasty habits come flooding back to him . The drinking , the snorting , the smoking . . . all because of a blonde . I would be impervious to this . In fact , Jeanne Triplehorn , who plays Curran's psychiatrist , is a billion times more sexy than Sharon Stone . Especially when she wears her glasses . But that's just my thing . One can accuse Basic Instinct of being contrived , overly-complicated and over-plotted but they'd be missing the point . I do feel that the irony of gutter-level fiction becoming real within gutter-level fiction would have been more appropriate and perhaps louder if Basic Instinct were a book , but as a movie it makes its point despite the high level tawdriness that most audiences are going think is all the film has to offer . Paul Verhoeven takes a Hitchcockian approach to the material as there are already a few connections to Vertigo . At one point in the film , Sharon Stone even dresses up in an outfit identical to Kim Novak ( hairstyle and all ) . You can't help but notice the sleaze sometimes though . Like Michael Douglas walking around a nightclub in a horrible V-neck sweater or the ' infamous ' leg-crossing scene with is only really notable for its unsubtlety . There are also some parts of the film which kind of date it badly . The production design and fashion is sooo early 90s . It's not the kind of story that oozes class but the outdated look kinda distracts . But the one amazing thing Basic Instinct has going for it is Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully haunting score . Truly one of his best in the latter part of his career . Add it all up and Basic Instinct is wildly inconsistent in terms of quality but the sheer OTT nature of plot is enough to keep it afloat . And all these years later , when we have mostly become impervious to titillation , people still remember all the skanky publicity and the aroma of sleaze will never quite die away . See past all that and you'll find a clever thriller underneath .
564223	102816	480461	7.0	A pretty good mystery .	Okay , we understand that a Scooby-Doo mystery is not going to be in the same league as a Citizen Kane mystery . But Scooby has good movies and bad movies just like any other Mega-Star . I'm pleased to say that Where's My Mummy is in the former category . Velma is assisting an archaeological dig in Egypt ( on the Sphinx no less ) when she finds a mysterious necklace which could be the key to Cleopatra's lost treasure . I've never heard of such treasure , but for the sake of the movie , we'll pretend it exists . The rest of the Mystery Inc . gang turn up to visit her but the site is promptly taken over by Amelia von Butch ( Christine Baranski ) , a gun-ho Lara Croft-type and her band of cohorts . Despite warnings of ancient curses she forces the Mystery Inc . gang and an obnoxious reality-TV host ( Jeremy Piven ) to enter the tomb with her to solve it's secrets and find the treasure . Immediately setting-off traps , Shaggy and Scooby are separated from the rest of the gang ( not on purpose for a change ) and get involved in their own mystery of a deranged Hotep ( Ron Pearlman ) and his followers who worship a strange God known as Scoobis and his servant Shagman . Both stories are kept lively and entertaining until they merge into one . There's not a moment of boredom and , as usual , a couple of cool original songs too . But sadly , no new version of Scooby-Doo , Where Are You at all . To compare it with similar films like Indiana Jones , Tomb Raider or even The Goonies would be pointless . Yes , we've seen this kind of thing before but animation is a medium that present more opportunities than live-action and there's loads of inventive set-pieces and imaginative locations that have become the standard of modern Scooby-Doo outings . And what do you know ? It even manages to provide a rather surprising twist at the end . We know it's far-fetched and unbelievable as always , but it ties together pretty well , thus making the film a little bit better a little bit more . As long as their is imagination behind this franchise , Scooby-Doo could go on forever . He may deliver a few duds from time to time ( Monster of Mexico was extremely crap after all ) but he still a very important character in modern animation and will always come out on top if we believe in him . Or am I taking this too seriously ?
564757	102816	271668	7.0	What the problem is ?	I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies . But compared to his other movie of 2003 ( that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II ) , National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs . A lot of them , surprisingly , coming from Lawrence himself . Hank Rafferty ( Steve Zahn ) is a cop who is unfairly thrown in jail for apparently beating a black suspect ( Lawrence ) who just got kicked out of Police Academy . With his career in tatters he emerges from the slammer with only one job opportunity available ; a lowly guard for a lowly security company . Determined to follow up on the big case he was involved with before serving time , he crosses the path of fellow security guard Earl Montgomery ( Lawrence again ) and the two reignite their old conflict . The old love / hate buddy thing may be old and the plot may be silly but it's a great excuse for loads of action set-pieces and humor . The potentially dangerous comedy of black vs white never becomes offensive and is handled with such lightness that it never becomes an issue . Both men have their failings and bonuses and are as equal as each other . You really do feel a great partnership between them despite their arguing and fights . Give National Security a try . It's slick and fast-moving and is a helluva lot better than Bad Boys II . You'll probably be surprised at how funny Martin Lawrence is . I was . The DVD is in great looking 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen with pretty good Dolby 5 . 1 sound . The scenes where Lawrence uses his automatic pistol really pack a heavy punch in the . 1 LFE channel . The usual deleted scenes and commentary are included on the DVD but I was surprised the extended ending wasn't included in the film . It would have been better with it .
563821	102816	316654	8.0	Big Improvement	It's no secret that I absolutely hated the first film . But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement , pathos and humor . Almost every area where the first film lagged in improved upon . Though I'm still not keen on Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker ( not tall enough , too much of a geek ) he was better in the role this time around . Though I'm not sure why he's still a total nerd . This is not how Peter Parker is portrayed in the comic books and it's weird that in the movie he comes across more like Clark Kent . The CGI effects are miles better too . Some shots still looked a little iffy , but rest was so seamless I never noticed . Granted , it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were . A lot more time and care as been put into arranging them than before . Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a hundred what Willem Dafoe's campy , power-ranger Green Goblin was . You could tell that underneath he really was a good guy who was just too carried away with his work . He really did have a menacing presence in any scene featuring him with his extra arms ( surely more resembling a spider Peter Parker ) . The earthquakes signaling his approach are very cool . The sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set-pieces . The first one felt like an empty showcase for effects but here they were integral to the story . I'm not keen on Kirsten Dunst though ( she looks far too much like my ex ) . In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman . I just don't see that in Kirsten Dunst . However , she really did get into the character and I believed in her relationship with Peter this time as before it felt like rejected sub-Dawson's Creek trash . Spiderman 2 is also made in widescreen , which is cool as I was disappointed at Sam Raimi's inexplicably shooting the original ' flat ' . A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before . Considering how the movie has already earned $40 kabillion in 3 weeks you hardly need me to tell you to go out and see it . But for once the box office receipts are validated by a good movie . Look out for some funny in-jokes to Evil Dead and Bruce Campbell in a funny cameo as an obnoxious theatre usher .
564719	102816	118571	8.0	Brilliantly done action	It's easy to understand why Airforce One was such a big hit . The President saves the country . America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from those no good filthy Reds again . Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts ( fuelled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score ) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President . But the film is very good in it's own right too . Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension , Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary . The film is also very well put together technically . The editing and sound is top-notch . But there are flaws . And one BIG flaw . Some of the dialogue really sucks . And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady . The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady . Her role is totally useless . I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it . I am not kidding . Even Oldman at one point tells her to ' SHUT UP ! ' I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have . If you can overlook this minor , although highly irritating , glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many , increasingly exciting , set-pieces . Very cool .
564318	102816	118771	8.0	BEST THRILLER EVER	It doesn't need huge bombastics to be entertaining . Or any OTT elaborateness . No-siree-bob . This truly is a solid action thriller . Kurt Russell is very realistic as the distraught hubbie but even more believable and CHILLING is JT Walsh . He simply is THE greatest bad guy ever ( TM ) . No one could have made him Eviler . I try to impersonate him but I cannot come anywhere near as close to the cold-hearted coolness that he created in the role . When he denies ever seeing Russell or giving Quinlan a ride is like . . . so scary and cool .
564421	102816	120696	8.0	Great action movie	This movie worked best in the cinema . It's too bad it flopped because the big screen is where it deserved to be seen . Too many folks have seen and criticised this film from TV viewings that do the scope of the action no justice whatsoever . The action scenes are incredible and this movie is very well made . The bouncing , shaking , wobbling camera was an innovative idea and if you like the slow-motion fire-fights of John Woo movies but hate the gun pornography of trash like Bad Boys II then you'll get a kick out of Hard Rain . And the music was just totally awesome too . Chris Young's score is the orchestral sound of violence , mayhem and nature taking over . Seriously , it's great stuff and you really ought to get the score CD . Christian Slater also makes for a better action hero in this than he did in hard rain . Randy Quaid and Morgan Freeman were very good too but I don't think Minnie Driver did a convincing American accent . Don't be to hard on this film . It isn't supposed to be Citizen Kane . It's a pure action film with the minimal of plot to get in the way . It was originally called The Flood and had numerous other characters in it and had many daylight scenes . But because of an abundance of disaster movies at the time it was re-shot as an action movie that was set totally at night . And practically in real time too . Sadly the Region 1 DVD is in Dolby 5 . 1 and is letterboxed at 2 . 30 : 1 . It's not the best DVD of the film . If you have a multi-regional player then I suggest that you get the Korean Region 3 box set with a beautiful anamorphic transfer , DTS 5 . 1 and the script book included .
563833	102816	88993	8.0	Good Day	While the original Dawn of the Dead is , undoubtedly , the zenith of Zombie movies , I must admit ' Day ' is my favourite so far . It would be hard to follow-up Dawn with a superior film and Day met with much apathy on its release . Which really isn't fair . Shorter ( Dawn was extremely long ) and easier to swallow in one viewing , Day is brighter and clearer than Dawn ( naturally ) . Now the Zombies have total world control . There are very few survivors of the apocalypse . Once such group ( half Army , half government scientists ) have made a base in an abandoned Florida missile silo . The Army are a thoroughly unpleasant lot and there's no way to root for them . The scientists and nicer though and have better intentions . But the show is stolen by Bub , the tamed zombie . He's totally brilliant ! Wouldn't he make a great pet ? I even got a bit teary when he got his big scene at the end . Tom Savini ( sadly missing from the cast this time around ) does incredible work on the make-up and gore effects . The zombies look better than they did in Dawn and the bodies being ripped apart are about as graphic and realistic as you can get without doing it for real . For a low-budget film made 20 years ago it's astonishing how good Savini's work is . Dawn had a bleak ending tinged with the slightest bit of hope ( unlike the remake ) but Day has a calmer , more relaxed fade out . Stay alert for a few references to Dawn including a return of the ' Zombie March ' theme . This new 2-Disc DVD from Anchor Bay marks the 2 , 345 , 205th release of this film on DVD . But you couldn't ask for a better , more definitive version . The 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture has been put through Anchor Bay's Divimax process and it looks absolutely stunning and crystal clear . The sound has also been remastered into strong Dolby 6 . 1 , DTS ES sound . There are zillions of extras and actually worth your time too . The DVDs also come in an extremely cool digipack featuring the highly lovable Bub on the front . Bub rules !
564814	102816	71679	8.0	Really Sweet	The peanuts gang are up to their usual mischief in preparation for Easter Sunday , but no one seems to be listening to Linus . He swears that the Easter Beagle will come and make the celebrations complete . Typically no one listens to him , he is little bit ' Ralph Wiggum ' remember . Though Snoopy ends up being that very Beagle , he's far too busy trying to help out Woodstock . The poor little bird is freezing in his cruddy little nest full of cold water . So Snoopy goes off to the mall ( already advertising Xmas goodies ! ) to buy him a bird house . With hilarious results . After much hijinks and endless trips to the mall for eggs ( Marcie keeps smashing them as she doesn't know how to do egg-painting ) Snoopy saves the day and proves Linus right after all . Sigh ! They don't make ' em like this anymore . I'll take Snoopy over Spongebob any day .
564713	102816	387575	8.0	You can't keep a good guy down !	The Chucky films have had a curious consistency in the decline of horror and the incline of humour . Child's Play was played straight for chills . Yes , it was ridiculous but had a rather mean-spirited edge to it that made you forget how silly it was . Child's Play 2 was less savage but with a touch more humour . Child's Play 3 ( a film that had an unbelievably bad reputation thanks to moronic tabloids in the UK ) found the right balance between laughs and scares . Chucky was downright evil , but you began to root for him more and more because his one-liners and easily irritable personality became rather er . . . cute . Ronny Yu's Bride Of Chucky , while very gory , simply was not a horror film at all - an entertaining black comedy that was ridiculously over-the-top , yes , but not a horror . Now , fifth time around , series creator Don Mancini steps behind the camera , cranks the bad taste all the way up to eleven and delivers the most intelligent dumb film you've ever seen . The horror is non-existent but the gore is plentiful and the humour sicker than a syphilitic junkie . He rips out all the stop signs with such carefree abandon and directs with such hedonistic pleasure that you can't help pity other directors who take their own material far too seriously . The child born at the end of Bride Of Chucky ( voiced by Billy Boyd ) has been picked up by a gruff English new age traveller and made to act in a fake-ventriloquist circus show , thanks to his bizarre doll-like appearance . He knows he's not normal , suffers terrible nightmares of killing and slaughter and is eager to find his real parents . In Hollywood , a new movie called Chucky Goes Psycho , starring Jennifer Tilly , based on the Chucky urban legend is in production and when the young orphan sees a behind-the-scenes clip of what can only be his real mum and dad on TV , he escapes to Tinseltown to find out why they abandoned him . The obligatory chant to the almighty voodoo god Damballa resurrects Chucky and Tiffany , who are more than delighted to be together with their own child . Trouble is , they can't decide whether he's a boy , or a girl - a Glen , or a Glenda . However , the killer dolls are still keen to get out of their plastic bodies once and for all and be human again . Obviously Tiffany is partial to Jennifer Tilly's body and Chucky aims to switch places with rapper / actor / director Redman who is planning a new Jesus Christ movie . As you can imagine , many deaths occur along the way , much to the distress of Glen / Glenda . It sounds same-old-same-old , but let me assure you that Mancini crams as much daft humour and sick jokes in as possible . John Waters - the King of Bad Taste himself - has a hilarious extended cameo as a sleazy tabloid photographer who happens to snap a silhouetted image of Chucky hammering one off to a porno mag . How crazy is that ? Chucky himself is a wonderful comic character . You just can't help but love him . Don't you think that he and Tiffany make a cute couple ? He may be short but he's far scarier than Michael Myers ever was and his mere presence makes every scene a riot . Seed Of Chucky is not a film for everyone . You have to be pretty open-minded to endure the morbid humour , but it's the guiltiest pleasure you're likely to have for a long time . The self-aware Hollywood references never become intrusive and the convoluted story never becomes confusing . Still , as I have said , it's not easy going entertainment if you're a stuffy conservative . All fans of gore and brainless amusement must see . Oh , and in case you recognise the actor playing Jennifer Tilly's lawyer , that's Nicholas Rowe , better known as Young Sherlock Holmes .
564184	102816	46908	8.0	So cute !	I love the Tasmanian Devil . Isn't he so cute ? So what if he eats everything ! I found Bugs ' tricks rather cruel , after all a Taz Devil has to eat right ? In this cartoon , his first appearance , he comes across Bugs in his usual hunger rampage and wants him for dinner . But Bugs has other ideas and resorts to his old schemes and traps . Standard fare but funny and Taz is wonderfully hug-able . His TV show from the early 90's was terrible but as a character he is great . There are not a lot of Looney Tunes characters with so much potential as their own franchise but Taz is to Warner what Winnie the Pooh is to Disney .
564366	102816	79714	8.0	Very odd , but very cool .	As a successful director of kid's films , Don Coscarelli felt like moving into horror . But he was out of ideas so he shut himself in a mountain cabin for a few weeks and dreamt up Phantasm . God only knows what he was smoking or drinking in order to conjure up a story like this . I've been watching it for over six years , trying to get my head around it . But like the most complex of David Lynch films , there are still some parts of the puzzle that are too warped to fit . Mike and Jody Pearson are two brothers living in small town California . Their parents have recently died , leaving twenty-something Jody in charge of 13-year-old Mike . But Jody is restless and cannot stay cooped up in such a small town for long . Mike dreads that Jody will dump him with an aunt or uncle and disappear beyond the horizon . But that's the least of his worries for the moment . Jody's friend has mysteriously committed suicide and after his funeral Mike , hiding in the bushes , sees the undertaker , a sinister Tall Man , heave the coffin out of the ground all by himself and dump it back in the Hearse . Knowing something ain't quite right about all this , Mike investigates the funeral home and is attacked by hooded dwarfs , flying killer chrome spheres ( inspired by one of Coscarelli's nightmares ) and is chased by the Tall Man . He gets away but loses a shoe and hacks off some of the Tall Man's fingers for proof . It's not an ordinary finger , it oozes some kind of yellow puss ( embalming fluid perhaps ) and still pokes around on it's own . Convinced of supernatural interference , the brothers team up with their Ice Cream vendor pal Reggie to kick the Tall Man's head in . It ain't that easy I'm afraid and the film turns from weirdo horror into positively strange sci-fi as the trio discover more and more inexplicable activity going on at Morningside Cemetery . The film doesn't have many faults . But it is quite frustrating seeing the characters do no more than go to the cemetery and go home , then go to the cemetery and go home for , more or less , the entire running time . Don Coscarelli shot about 3 hours worth of footage and only ended up using half that . There are loads of fun scenes left out that , while not essential to the film's plot , could have kept things more balanced . The total 70s feel is a major plus though . Man , I wish I were a kid back then . The big hair , the flares , the cool cars , the loose women and the funky music are all part of this film . The hip 70s score is also incredibly funky and spooky at the same time . Once you start humming it there's no stop . It's also very different from the typical 70s horror formula . There are no masked killers , no women being chased through the woods and no slasher fodder characters . Mike , Jody and Reggie are bold and decisive and choose to fight instead of running and hiding . The setting of rural California is also a refreshing change from medieval castles , hick villages or haunted houses . Angus Scrimm , who plays the Tall Man , is no doubt the film's best asset . He hardly says a word but he OWNS every scene he's in . His physical presence and menace makes him a damn cool horror villain and he ought to be as iconic as Freddy or Jason . No matter what way you look at it , Phantasm never makes complete sense . You can turn it upside down , inside out and back-to-front and you might be able to work most of it out , but there will always be one thing that sticks out . Don Coscarelli claimed he wanted it to be open-ended and ambiguous as a way of not having to make any sequels . That tactic didn't work .
564145	102816	381061	8.0	A Royale without cheese .	CR is a major step-up from the flamboyant Die Another Day . Obnoxious 50-something runt Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a young Daniel Craig , there is no Q , no campy gadgets , no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits , no world-dominating super-colossus villains , no Miss Funnyfanny ( or whatever ) and no silly one-liners after killing bad guys . Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone . I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I'm glad someone had the balls to go back to the hard-edged nature of the series , last seen in Licence to Kill . The longest Bond movie so far , at 145 minutes , but it breezes by even though it reigns in on the normally excessive action scenes and depicts spying a more ' mundane ' and ' realistic ' manner ( or at least as true as the series has been so far ) . But the one-thing that bugs me about action movies , particularly the Bond franchise , is that they are , most of the time , childish male fantasies with an indestructible hero who has fun shooting up the place and beds beautiful women . I would like something new for a change but CR does have Bond get hurt and go through more pain than he has previously . Daniel Craig has been given a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond ( like Clive Owen , Jude ' Mr Pretension ' Law or 10-year-old girl masquerading as a grown man Orlando Bloom WOULDN'T have been a big mistake ? ) but not only does he have his youth as an advantage ( he's the first 30-something to be cast in the role since Lazenby ) , he's also pretty damn trim , has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional . It's also good to a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde ? Or the shortest actor to play him so far ? I would have preferred that composer David Arnold went too . They didn't seem to be holding back on the amount of regular production team members who got axed . Even Vic Armstrong didn't return . I've never liked Arnold's work on the movies and I hate to think of it as something that's now exclusively HIS baby . But the theme song was cool , despite the criticism and it was cool to have the Bond theme at the end instead of some tacky song . I just wish the product placements would go too . Nice try attempting to ' subtly ' plug Blu-Ray Sony . But it ain't gonna work on me . Now that the franchise has a different outlook , I hope some of Ian Fleming's more downbeat , not - exactly - blockbuster - material Bond stories can make it to the screen .
564604	102816	99399	8.0	Kids playing action movie as an actual film .	An unfortunate , misjudged and misunderstood film that could have been something great but only clings to the bottom-rung of respectability . For a start , it has an unashamedly awful and truly despicable villain who oozes evil from every stinking orifice . When eccentric bad guys are not hammy , they are Ramon Cota ( a sickening performance by villain's villain of choice and villain of the week Billy Drago ) . Cota is a Columbian drug lord , who ships massive amounts of cocaine into America . He kills DEA agents with unnatural glee , murders pregnant women , tortures people to death in a gas chamber , rapes women , murders their husbands , murders sick babies and uses their bodies to smuggle cocaine - you get the picture , this guy is lower than minus infinity . In a rare opportunity to catch him , Colonel Scott McCoy ( the ever-bearded Chuck Norris ) kidnaps Cota in mid-air and drags him into court only to watch him leave with virtually no charge . More DEA agents are kidnapped and it's up to Chuck to rescue them from death . So he heads off to the fictional South American country of San Carlos for some mighty kicking-of-ass . Killing Cota is not his mission , rescuing the DEA agents is , but you know that Cota is going to get what he deserves ( with a little bit of slightly unsubtle philosophy from Norris ) . The script is generic and by numbers . Never before has a movie been so strictly routine , but there are some real cool action scenes and so much melodrama that it could fuel EastEnders for a decade . The direction leaves a lot to be desired . If someone other than Chuck's brother had made this , we would have a hugely enjoyable film on our hands . Instead plot holes , illogical moments and a general feel of immaturity bog it down . The action ranges from Norris flying through the sky , swinging through the jungle , falling off cliffs and dodging rockets . The main problem with the direction is that Aaron Norris uses the logic , " If it is in slow motion , then it is cool . " He wants to drag out every bloody detail , every death dance and every penetration of every bullet . It's a shame Delta Force 2 isn't hyper-kinetic , because the slo-mo becomes very noticeable . Chuck Norris ' methods are also highly questionable . For a man who moves at 48 frames per second he sure does lay waste to thousands of Drago's henchman very well . And beating up the new Delta Force recruits to train them in the deadly arts is just bizarre . General Taylor ( John P . Ryan ) , a character so relentless gung-ho and over-the-top that he really should be in a pantomime , is McCoy's boss and he enjoys himself way too much when he tags along on the mission to blow away zillions of nameless henchman from a helicopter that is so indestructible and equipped with a never-ending supply of ammo you wonder why the REAL Delta Force doesn't use this thing over in Afghanistan . Ryan certainly did wrap himself in the American flag for this character . But hey , it worked for Stallone with John Rambo . The single spot-on aspect of the whole movie has to be the strong and rousing musical score by Frederick Talgorn . If the rest of the movie was as good as this , then everything would be different . Instead Delta Force 2 is a mixed bag . There is a good film here , desperate to get out , but you have to claw your way through to find it .
564681	102816	456118	8.0	A well above average porno DV	This DVD starts off with the gorgeous Michelle Banks . She enters a ( totally deserted ) restaurant and awaits her boyfriend . As she does so she imagines what it would be like to get a double-penetration from the 2 waiters . This fantasy lasts for about 25 minutes . Next up is Alicia Rhodes , her house is being decorated by 2 guys so obviously she fantasises about getting a DP . A good scene with a cute girl . Nicola Holt is third . She's working-out in a gym with 2 guys and imagines herself exercising naked . Sex and double penetration follow . She loves what she does and it really makes the scene work . Why can't all porn actresses show the enthusiasm she does ? The next scene is the weakest of the whole DVD . A pool cleaner fantasises about the 2 women ( McKenzie Lee and Angel Long ) sitting in the garden of the house he is attending . The sex is quite dull and the DP only comes in the form of a strap-on wearing girl . Plus he wears a condom with only one of them so it's a bit weird he'd fantasise about THAT . Last is Nikita Devine , who has a gorgeous shaven haven . The plumbers are looking at her sink but she can't help but think about getting a double penetration from them . The sex is good and it caps off a great DVD that you should definitely get if you like easy-going porn . Obviously the acting is terrible and the rehearsal bad ( do you even rehearse porn ? ) . Why the waiters would scan around an empty restaurant for a table is beyond me . It is a shame there is no double vaginal , double anal or gapes though .
564093	102816	77766	8.0	A BETTER THAN AVERAGE SEQUEL	This and the first are the OFFICIAL Jaws movies in my opinion . Before it got REALLY bad . The shark is just as scary as it was before and it's good to have storylines from the first film present here . Trust me , it's not as bad as REVENGE .
564314	102816	101452	8.0	A wild , imaginative and eccentric fantasy	Sequels rarely improve on the originals . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is bursting at the seams with wacky humor , craziness and invention . Yes , the first was a brilliant ride too but it doesn't live up to this . Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just great in their dual roles as good Bill and Ted and evil Bill and Ted robots from the future . I've never really seen Keanu as convincing in anything else , maybe it's the characters he chooses and not his talent . Too bad his biggest exposure has been as a wooden statue in the god-awful Matrix trilogy . But it's not just Reeves and Winter this time , William Sadler's Grim Reaper is also along for the ride and he steals the show like you've never seen before . Rufus isn't in this one for very long but William Sadler more than makes up for that . The plot is a bit much to swallow if you're not familiar with the mechanics of the original . A nasty old tyrant 700 years in the future sends evil robot Bill and Teds back through time in the phone booth time machines to kill the good Bill and Ted and prevent their perfect society taking over the world . Once dead Bill and Ted go to hell , challenge the Grim Reaper to a game of Battleship , visit God ( after a spot of mugging in heaven ) , get help from a Martian , brought back from the dead , make good Bill and Ted robots and take on the evil Tyrant guy during a Battle of the Bands finale . Whew ! Peter Hewitt ( only 25 at the time ) brings a bizarre sophistication to the sequel that wasn't present in the blandly shot first film . B & TBJ literally looks like a whacked-out cartoon come to life . The production design is very colorful and vivid , reminiscent of Tim Burton , only not crap . Don't misjudge this film as being in the same sub-genre as those awful stoners Jay and Silent Bob or even Wayne's World . This is not a dumb generation Xer film , it's a lovely , silly fantasy for all ages and is definitely superior to the original . Hey Warner , hurry up and release the Bill and Ted animated series on DVD . I want it NOW ! Unlike Excellent adventure , this film was shot in plain-old 1 . 85 : 1 and the anamorphic transfer on the DVD looks fine and does justice to the very broad color pallet of film . The soundtrack is in Remastered Dolby 5 . 1 and it sounds above average if not amazing . Definitely get this . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is thoroughly non-non-non heinous .
564287	102816	348034	9.0	Seems to have been forgotten by most people	When you mention Christmas specials one would normally think of Charlie Brown , The Smurfs , He-Man / She-Ra or any other franchise that ' saves Christmas ' . No one really remembers that the Simpsons began with their very own Christmas special . Already a hit as an animated short series on the Tracey Ullman show , The Simpsons kicked off their 17-year plus career as a prime-time family with this festive episode . Excited and filled with yuletide cheer The Simpsons come face to face with disaster when Marge's savings need to be blown on tattoo-removal surgery for Bart . And Mr . Burns cancels bonuses for all his semi-skilled employees . Flanders is already throwing his family the best Christmas ever and to make matters worse Patty and Selma show up and cast their judging eyes upon Homer in a more evil way than usual . He can't let them all down so he humiliates himself with a job as a mall Santa Claus . The job pays poorly so he gambles it at the track , expecting a miracle to happen . Do you think it will ? Since this was way back at the very beginning of The Simpsons the animation looks pretty rough and the voice acting ( especially from some of the children ) sounds a lot like the Charlie Brown phonetic acting . And since this is an older episode Homer isn't the machine he became in 1998 + seasons . He's still a human being with feelings who tries to be a good dad . Bart is still a kid who gets in trouble and Marge is still a devoted mum . You know what I mean when I say that none of this is really relevant in The Simpsons anymore since every new season just gets worse and worse as the writers get more and more cynical . This one Christmas Special represents the exact opposite of all that . It was made to make a difference to your Christmas . And if your tired of the awful bore that it's become now then perhaps you should check it out .
563814	102816	100802	9.0	One of Verhoeven's best movies , no doubt .	Arnie is Doug Quaid , a simple construction worker who is bored with his uneventful life and wishes to be more and to do something meaningful . He's fascinated with going to Mars and meeting the mysterious woman of his dreams ( that would be Melina ) despite the civil war brewing withing the colonies . His wife Lori ( Sharon Stone , looking gorgeous ) is appalled with all things Martian and quickly nixes that idea . The only way Quaid is going to come close to the red planet is if he takes a Rekall vacation , a company that literally offers you a ' dream ' vacation memory implant . Quaid wishes to go as a secret agent and all seems well until they send him to sleep . As soon as he's unconscious Quaid seems to wake up in a rage , claiming his name is not Quaid but Hauser . And it's not just the dream going wrong since the Rekall technicians have not even implanted the dream yet . Blacking out again and waking up in a cab , Quaid has totally no recollection of anything that has happened and is confused to find his life turned upside down . His wife and colleagues are trying to kill him , dozens of armed henchmen are after him , he seems to have acquired lethal killing skills from nowhere and he apparently has some unfinished business back on Mars , despite the fact that he's never been there . Or has he ? Once on Mars for real ( or is it ? ) he finds himself involved with the beautiful Melina ( Rachel Ticotin , even prettier than Sharon Stone ) , the underground resistance and battling their arch-nemesis Vilos Cohaagen , a bureaucrat who has the entire planet under his control . It seems that Hauser was Cohaagen's right hand man and left clues for the fabricated Quaid persona to topple Cohaagen's regime . Total Recall is certainly one of Arnie's and Verhoeven's most imaginative and creative movies . The Mars town of Venusville is basically Amsterdam's Red Light District with booze , drugs and sex everywhere , the violence is so ridiculously over-the-top that one cannot help but laugh at it ( despite a lot of the gorier bits being censored by the evil MPAA ) , the vision of the future is incongruously bleak but colorful and fanciful yet primitive . The contrasts between Earth and Mars are similar to Western and Third World comparisons . The visual effects , if slightly dated , are simply amazing . Jerry Goldsmith's awesome score is , at once , atmospheric and action-packed . The set-pieces , especially Quaids vision of the alien furnaces , are just ludicrously entertaining and the ' is it a dream or is it real ' premise puts such a wonderfully surreal twist on the whole thing . Sci-Fi has never been so outrageous . What do you expect with mad genius Dutchman directing ? And I do believe that it IS real .
564491	102816	364569	9.0	An absolutely intriguing mystery	I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason . Well , I'm glad I just decided to go ' what the hell ' because it IS actually really , really good . Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews , I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets , imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for 15 years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone . He has 5 days to find the man who imprisoned him and why . An absorbing set-up and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a wicked dark sense of humor . The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns , always keeping us on the edge of our seats . There are some brilliant fight scenes and some truly bizarre moments , such as a live octopus being eaten whole . But what really floored me was the ending . I won't tell you a tiny little bit of it . But . . . wow ! As is the case with EVERY SINGLE Asian MOVIE , Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood . Because anything that the Asians can do , Hollywood can apparently do better . In my opinion this film really doesn't need a remake as this version is strong enough to appeal to the whole world . Too bad most of the planet are philistines who would rather ' watch ' a film than ' read ' it . A complaint I hear often enough . If your impression of Asian films is they are all shoddy and not very modern looking then , in the case of Oldboy , you are very much mistaken . Among the many strong points of the movie are the faultless editing and stunning photography . Oldboy is the slickest movie I have seen in a good while and can easily out-gloss anything by Michael Bay . Do yourself a favor and check this movie out . If you don't love it then you truly have no business watching films at all . I'll save you time and tell you outright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that . At the risk of sounding like a pretentious ass , leave the more important films to the brainiacs .
564094	102816	78748	9.0	Never has the contrast been clearer	I'm a fan of the old Ridley Scott , which was ironically the young Ridley Scott . Back in his youth he made some great films and Alien is one of his crowning achievements . But let's ignore the film for just a second . You see the Scott Brothers ( Ridley and Tony ) had a highly visual sense of film-making that used the widescreen frame to its fullest potential . From quite early on they were made best pals of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and they made their reputations with such films like Beverly Hills Cop 2 , Blade Runner and Top Gun . In the early 90's their careers briefly faltered and a hack called Michael Bay went into business . Michael Bay ripped off everything he possible could from the Scotts . So much so that in recent years Ridley and Tony have had to exaggerate their style in an effort to distance themselves from this man . The result has been films that look more like agonising , drawn-out epileptic seizures ( Man on Fire , Black Hawk Down , Domino ) than works of art . Now let's get back to Alien . A beautifully paced , shot and cut fright machine with perfectly timed scares , meaningful subtext and an iron-grip on the audience . How far removed from the work of the Scott Brothers today . The franchise went to hell in 2004 with the awful Alien vs Predator movie but in its beginning the Alien films were a thing of greatness . If you can , see the director's cut . I saw this film twice in the cinema ( original cut , then director's cut ) and while they're both good the director's cut is a bit faster and has a couple real cool extra scenes and shot of the creature . And of course , widescreen is how this film MUST be seen .
564210	102816	489229	9.0	Action-packed !	Remember the arcades back in the ' good old days ' of video-gaming ? Before polygons and 3D took over there was a time when you could walk into an arcade that was thick with the smell of sweat as dozens of teenagers hammered away furiously at the buttons of countless machines . You'd probably have to queue-up to play your favorite game or if you had no money you'd just watch someone else who was better than you . When you did get a go the stick was hard to get a grip it'd be soaked in sweat so much and your fingers would be so numb after a few minutes of play that your hand would go all cramped . Midnight Resistance ( a sequel to the 1987 game Heavy Barrel ) was one of those classic arcade games made by Data East ( one of the top companies at the time ) that was so cool you didn't care how hard it was . If you're familiar with the Turrican series of games then you'll love Midnight Resistance . It features 10 levels of similar gameplay with hordes of enemies coming at you from all directions and enough mega-firepower to deal with them all . You'll be leaping , jumping , climbing and crawling everywhere as hundreds of bursts of gunfire blaze across the screen . The fire-fight just doesn't let up for a second for the entire game . And you'll love it . Having said that , it's a very weird and surrealistic game . You're supposed to be a member of some Drug Enforcemant Squad , according to the instructions , but the enemies are often demonic and the ' story ' takes you through industrial cities , laboratories , forests and outer-space to battle giant , disembodied brain stems and free you're family from mad scientists . Very weird indeed . But that was all the rage back in 1990 , when arcade games were filled with bizarre imagery and disorientating level designs to keep you off-guard . Like other games of the era it is very , very hard ; a dastardly ploy to make you spend more and more money to get through the game . But when you had this much fun , it was worth it . Definitely one to hunt down . Graphics Sound B Gameplay A Lasting
563862	102816	271027	10.0	Terrific Modern Action Movie	Kiss of the Dragon is a hyperactive martial arts movie with a heavy European feel . After Jet Li's fans were left disappointed with the fake , CGI-enhanced fighting in Romeo Must Die he decided to go back to practical , hand-to-hand combat with literally no strings attached . KOTD is the perfect excuse for action , with minimal plot and impossible odds . Basically , Jet Li plays a Chinese cop Lui Jian who travels to Paris to help the police bring a crime boss to justice . But the French police just happen to be heavily , heavily corrupt and kill Mr . Big , framing Lui Jian in the process . Keen to stay alive , Lui Jian flees the scene , but not before screaming , mad and completely hat stand police inspector Richard ( Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role ) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him . Outrageously outnumbered , Lui Jian prevails and fights his way through swarms and swarms of thugs out for his blood . Using only his hands and feet ( and any useful nearby tool ) he manages to wipe them all out . Far-fetched it may be , but action choreographer Cory Yuen shoots it all in the most realistic and stylish way . You really will believe Lui Jian is capable of such an impossible feat , that's how realistic the action is . And all without glamorising guns . KOTD uses the rule of increasingly mad set-pieces . The first desperate escape through the corridors and passageways of the hotel , the death-defying escape from the Seine Barge and through the tunnels and sewers , the orphanage confrontation and ( especially ) the final scene in the police station where Lui Jian takes on a dojo full of martial artist police officers , evil twins and finally Inspector Richard . It's all breathtaking stuff and very , very violent . With far too many sanitised PG-13 minded ' action ' movies abundant these days KOTD is a breath of hardcore fresh air . If you like this then I suggest checking out The Transporter . It may be slightly tamer but it's made by the same people ( producer Luc Besson , Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Cory Yuen ) and is also set in France , only with a warmer , more exotic look . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with a great Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack . There are some extras and a commentary if you're into that sort of thing .
564100	102816	268583	10.0	Impossible	This game was probably one of the most violent and bloody I have ever played . Even by modern standards . But it was absolutely impossible to finish . And I played it with the infinite lives cheat too and it still took hours and hours . The premise of the game came from the Dark Horse comics of the same name in which Robocop's technology is linked to Cyberdyne . In order to stop the technology ( and even himself ever existing ) Robocop must travel to the future and defeat Skynet . But not before taking on zillions of T-800s and T-1000s first . One of the coolest features of the game were the power-ups that modified Robocop's armour or game him massive new weapons . And you needed them as you were under constant assault from all directions . The Sega Genesis version was the best as the Super-Nintendo had all the blood cut out of it . I hope one day this is reprogrammed for the PC . Virgin sure did a great job of making the comic book into a game and how cool would it be to have a Robocop vs Terminator movie . It would surely be the greatest thing ever ! ! !
564051	102816	83791	10.0	A major accomplishment !	It took an infinity of imagination to make The Dark Crystal , a film so overflowing with invention that you literally have to watch it about 100 times just to take it all in . Everyone involved , from the director to the best boy gave the film such loving affection and made it the best it could possibly be . Kid's movies ( if you want to call it that ) these days simply are not what they used to be and probably never will be again . This is yet another thing that makes The Dark Crystal so damn precious . The film is set in another world , in another time in an age of wonder . It has been 999 years and 1 year since the powerful , life-giving crystal cracked and stopping shining . Since then the land has become barren and the Urskeks ( a race of God-like beings ) have split into two separate races , the peaceful Uru ' Mystics ' and the evil Skeksis-a horrific cross between bird and reptile . The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years . If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever . Jen is a Gelfling ( a sort of fairy creature ) , believed to be the last of his race . A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land . Raised by the Uru , Jen begins a journey to repair the crystal when the Skeksis Emperor dies ( in a truly disturbing scene ) . On his way he meets Aughra , a sort of witch creature and Kira , another Gelfling and her race of Podling people ( sort of like Fraggles ) . Though there is no specific love scene between them , there is a very nice romance developing through-out the story . Filmed in gorgeous locations across England and Scotland ( with the use of a lot of matte paintings of course ) the film really , really does take you to another world . There's not a single human in sight ( a perfect world or what ) and , with exception to the awful Skeksis , almost every creature is cute and fluffy ( such as Kira's Fizzgig ) . The production design , in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud , is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more . Trevor Jones ' breathtaking , beautiful score is among his best work ( tying with Merlin in 1998 ) and is surely some of the best film music you are ever likely to hear . Ever ! There was a limited edition of the score put on CD a few years ago but only 5000 were ever printed . It's sure to be quite expensive now but it's so goddamn worth it ! Henson , Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds . I prefer this one though ( no fruity songs , no David Bowie ! ) as it has a certain edge to it that Labyrinth lacks . An epic . A masterpiece . An unforgettable classic . The Dark Crystal is magical , mystical timeless classic . I can't recommend it enough . If only we still had movies like this . I'll take risk-taking The Dark Crystal over PC drek like The Shaggy Dog any day .
564556	102816	316697	10.0	Get ready to rumble !	Wow ! This was like the best fighting game ever . I totally loved Streets of Rage 2 . This was one of the true CLASSICS of the Sega Genesis . Whenever I fondly remember my beloved 16-bit console the fun I had playing SOR2 always comes to mind . Yuzo Koshiro's jazzy score was mind-blowing ! It completely immersed you in the seedy nightlife and underworld the game took place in . Even with this simple 16-machine SOR2 showed just how cool the music could still be . Me and my best pal played this non-stop on 2-player mode . It was definitely the most fun you could have on the Genesis . What a game it is ! ! ! If you see a copy snap it up quickly as they are rare and expensive . Graphics A Sound A Gameplay A Lasting Appeal
564684	102816	439795	10.0	The first game I ever completed	Saboteur was a great game ( in 1985 ) and as a four-year-old I was mighty pleased with myself when I finished it on my own with no help from the grown-ups . You played a ninja who arrives by dinghy to a huge industrial complex , intent on committing some evil act . All you really did was take one computer disc and put it in the mainframe to wipe it out or something . Honestly , it's been like 20 years since I played it . But I vividly remember climbing up and down loads of ladders , falling down lift shafts , taking out guards , going around in those cool subway trams and escaping in the helicopter . Since I am blessed with the useless gift of having a photographic memory I memorised my way around the entire complex ( yes , even when I was 4 ) and ended up completing the game several times over . Just for the fun of it . These days I can't even look at a game I have already finished . For a dated game on the truly ancient Sinclair ZX Spectrum this was brilliant . Most retro games of this age I would find hard to enjoy today but I know I would have fun playing Sabotuer again . And I'd probably still remember my way around .
564858	102816	469181	10.0	Brilliant adventure game	Featuring brilliant animation and cool puzzle-solving , Scooby-Doo Mystery plays like one of the old-fashioned text adventure games only loads more fun and with a ' point and click ' style gameplay . The game has 2 separate cases . The first is Blake Hotel in which Daphne's uncle has been kidnapped and it's up to Shaggy and Scooby to find him . The backgrounds and environment of the snowbound hotel are very atmospheric and it's loads of fun exploring everywhere looking for clues . Of the 2 cases I prefer this one . The second case is the Ha Ha Carnival where an evil clown is running loose creating havoc . Shaggy and Scooby must explore the whole amusement park and figure out a way to catch him . It's not as atmospheric as the first but still has great animation . Some of the best seen on the Sega Genesis . As expected , Shaggy and Scooby are the only gang members who do anything as Fred , Daphne and Velma wander off in one of their usual ' splitting up ' manoeuvres . This doesn't bother me as Shaggy and Scooby are what the show is really about anyway . Scooby-Doo mystery is so vivid and detailed that it's almost like an episode that you control . The only complaint that I can think of would be the rather repetitive music that only gets on your nerves in the second case . If you can find this game anywhere it is well worth your time and money . Maybe a bit too hard for kids though . Graphics Sound C Gameplay A Lasting Appeal
564838	102816	107659	10.0	Your pants will be dancing with figs ! ! !	Released in the same season as Last Action Hero ( another under-rated spoof of dumb action movies ) and sharing a few cast members with it too , Loaded Weapon is more light-hearted stab at those horrible ' buddy-buddy ' / ' loose cannon partnered with old guy days from retirement ' movies that were in unholy abundance around the late 80s and early 90s . Lethal Weapon ( a film that has really not dated well at all ) is to blame for the sudden popularity of this sub-genre and it's at this particular series that Loaded Weapon takes most of it's well deserved stabs . Emilio Estevez is Jack Colt , a gun-happy cop on the edge who has been walking a thin line between sanity and alcohol-fuelled psycho since his dog ran away . Samuel L . Jackson is Wes Luger , a Detective with only a few days before he retires . His former partner Billy York ( Whoopie Goldberg ) is killed and he demands to take the case even though his superiors think it was suicide . And so Colt and Luger get involved in a remarkably silly plot with cocaine disguised girl scout cookies . The evil General Murturs ( William Shatner thoroughly enjoying himself ) and his henchman Mr . Jigsaw ( Tim Curry ) plan to lure Colt and Luger into a trap before they foil his next major drug deal . There are loads of cameos and even more in-jokes than you can shake a stick at . What makes Loaded Weapon better than most other heartless spoofs is that every line of dialogue is delivered perfectly and every scene has it's own special moment ( if not more than one ) . From the hilarious opening in the mini-mart to pretty much any scene with Jon Lovitz ( spoofing that horrible Joe Pesci character ) there is loads to enjoy . Every aspect and cliché of this unfortunate sub-genre is exploited and made fun of , even the musical score plays a vital part in the humor of some scenes . Some of the most quotable lines of dialogue include : ' Half today . Half tomorrow . Half on delivery . ' ' I'm Detective Luger , this is Detective Colt . These are our wallets . ' ' You came ! ' - ' That's personal ! ' ' Ooware eez tha meecro-feelm ? ' ' Don't thank me . I'm just a cop doing his job . ' ' I'm your worst nightmare . ' - ' No waking up without my penis is my worst nightmare . ' And of course . . . ' CIGARETTE ! ! ! ' Unfortunately a decent knowledge of the Lethal Weapon films is required to get most of the jokes in this film but it's so funny that it's worth suffering through them first . It's a shame that they never made a sequel but never say never eh ?
564037	102816	106309	10.0	VERY GOO	This movie is very well made and has a decent plot . The editing may be a little ham-fisted in places but the shoot-outs are far from simple and the car chases rival that of even RONIN . It also has a sly sense of humour and self aware of it's stupidity . I like the music , it's highly thematic . I like George Segal's character , adding a little class to the oily villain he plays and Dolph is good . He's always good . Much better than Seagal or Van Damme or Stallone . It's a pity he's not in many high profile movies . But this one is definitely one of his best .
564365	102816	92644	10.0	The best of the three	Up to scratch in all areas apart from the editing . I'll get to that later . This one sees Axel head back to Beverly Hills after a 3-year gap to solve the Alphabet crimes . The film is more violent than the original and is truer to the Simpson / Bruckhiemer films that followed . When you compare this movie to more recent flicks like Con Air or Gone In 60 Seconds you can see a definite resemblance in style . These movies have very fast editing to heighten the action . Obviously the editors practised on this movie as the editing is very bad and there are many continuity mistakes . It doesn't retread the same ground either . The first summed up what Beverly Hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent Americans live in when they have more money than they can spend . As Axel says ' These rich people loose their minds and want to live in a donut ' , when describing to a building foreman that there are not supposed to be any right angles in the house he is about to ' steal ' . The music has improved a bit too . Even if some of it is a direct rip-off of the music in John Carpenter's Escape From New York . It's a shame the music ( not songs ) from these films is not available on soundtrack . Give Beverly Hills Cop 2 a chance and don't listen to the narrow-minded critics who panned this film ( 13 years ago ) . It is also the only one of the 3 that is in 2 . 35 : 1 .
564558	102816	331632	10.0	Just as good as the first .	As a Scooby fan I may be a bit biased but how you can deny that this is just great entertainment for everyone is beyond my understanding . Of course this isn't high art but it IS very well put together and there are plenty of in-jokes for the wiser viewers . This movie HAS to be mindless , it would lose its kid audience otherwise . But that doesn't mean there's no good humor or plot to it . Granted , the plot is dumb ( the gang go up against all the monsters from the first season , only this time they're real ) , but there is slight sophistication and the manic set-pieces just bombard us , one after the other . Once again , there's not a moment of boredom , but there are quieter scenes with the Mystery Inc . gang in which character is not completely ignored . The main stars are , as usual , Shaggy and Scooby . Matthew Lillard is dead-on as Shaggy . Give this man an Oscar , seriously ! One moment that requires major suspension of disbelief is not any scene feature sludge monsters or a talking dog but a scene in which Velma utters ' I'm not hot ' . NOT HOT ! ! ! ? ? ? ? WHAT ? ? ? She's a total babe , more so than Daphne . And I NEVER care about CGI FX in movies . But here they are so cool , colorful and convincing . Who are you to tell me Scooby Doo ain't real ? Go out and see this right away . Between this and Looney Tunes : Back in Action family movies are balancing out a little bit after the awful crud of Cat in the Hat and Cheaper by the Dozen . Give us Scooby Doo 3 right now ! ! !
564285	102816	90768	10.0	They don't make ' em like this anymore .	I'm so tired of modern family movies full of fart jokes or movies where teenagers make love to pastries and it's supposed to be funny and then they staple on some superficial message at the end in an attempt to be poignant and balance out all the trash that came before . Every other week we are tortured with some nonsense of this calibre and whenever I wish for a movie that stands out from the crowd I have to go back in time and consider some overlooked gem . The Boy Who Could Fly is exactly that . The characters seem so real and their emotions genuine , it builds at a slow pace but it never gets boring and story development is consistent . This is not a ferociously loud summer crowd-pleaser or something bloated with pointless SFX . Very few movies have the power to make a whole story out of characters and situation alone without feeling the need for some ridiculous set piece or blaring thrash metal guitars . In fact Bruce Broughton's score is the wonderful opposite of that . The performances , especially the two leads , are flawless and the direction is far more refined than the typical . Everything in this movie comes together perfectly to make a film so unique and charming . If you have lost your faith in the current dreck that graces our screens and if you want a family movie with some meaning and subtext then check this out . And keep an eye out for director John Carpenter as on of the Coupe De Villes . The DVD is in 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 2 . 0 . It has an introduction by Jay Underwood and director Nick ( Michael Myers ) Castle , they also feature in a commentary with Lucy Deakins and Fred Savage .
564820	102816	79833	10.0	Best Animated Movie Ever	The second big screen outing of Lupin III is already one of the best Anime movies ever made , while rivalling anything Disney or Pixar has to offer . Green ogres , fat superheroes or a zillion gigabytes of computer animation still cannot compare to 12 frames of hand drawn charm . For the uninitiated , Lupin III is the grandson of Arsene Lupin , the gentleman thief , created by Maurice Leblanc in the Twenties . He's always breaking into some impenetrable vault , or has a zillion gadgets up his sleeve to help with escaping if things go awry . He's also rather wacky and buffoonish , which makes his antics a joy to watch . Hayao Miyazaki ( Spirited Away , Howl's Moving Castle ) , in his movie debut , tones down the out of control wackiness of the Lupin III TV show and gives Lupin a rather decent plot to dig his teeth into . This is not an excuse to string together a bunch of insane set pieces . Seconds after robbing a Monte Carlo casino , Lupin and Jigen discover that every dollar note they have swiped is a fake . Only one place in the world is known to make these counterfeits and Lupin's underworld knowledge leads them to the tiny European country of Cagliostro ( think Luxemburg , only much , much smaller ) . Half a moment after crossing the border , Lupin and Jigen are involved in a car chase and rescue the Lady Clarisse from a bunch of goons . But she's promptly kidnapped again , though manages to leave Lupin a clue in the form of a strange wedding ring . Their suspicions over the kidnapping lead them to the titular castle where they discover that an evil Count has seized control of the country , using - guess what ? - funny money . And the ring is the key to a great treasure that can only be uncovered when the Lady Clarisse is married to the Count . Lupin deliberately blows his cover to Inspector Zenigata ( the perpetually stressed Interpol officer who is always chasing him ) as a diversion , while he breaks into the castle to rescue Clarisse . What follows is scene after scene of hairs breadth escapes and impossible scenarios . Miyazaki's attention to detail is what truly elevates this beyond typical animation quality . There are enough moments of quietness and atmosphere to balance out the loud scenes . A strong sense of setting also comes from the imaginative " photography " . Too many animated movies disorientate the audience with frenetic direction and over-indulgence , but Castle Of Cagliostro works so much better by taking its time and choosing the best angles to cover the action . His trademark flying machines and overeating scenes make their first big screen appearance here . Far from his typical sub-genre of eco-friendly animation , Miyazaki is obviously a big fan of Lupin and has made a movie that refuses to be missed . Even Spielberg called CoC " one of the best adventure movies ever . " Any fan of Miyazaki should check out this film immediately . One should be aware that the Maurice Leblanc estate doesn't entirely approve of the Lupin III franchise . As a result he is mostly known in the new Optimum Region 2 DVD version as " Wolf " ( get it ? ) . The Manga release of this film was entirely re-dubbed in English with Lupin restored but the new Optimum DVD uses the original English voice actors .
564039	102816	118880	10.0	Best action film of the late 90s	Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it . Nic Cage ( in a typically bad performance ) is Cameron Poe , a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife . After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird . But this is no ordinary flight . On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus ' The Virus ' Grissom ( John Malkovich ) a men on death row for murder , robbery , kidnapping and extortion . Nathan ' Diamond Dog ' Jones ( Ving Rhames ) , a black militant inside for murder . Billy Bedlam ( Nick Chinlund ) , inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog . Pinball Parker ( Dave Chapelle ) , a pimp and drug-dealer . Swamp Thing ( MC Gainey ) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack . And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler ( Steve Buscemi ) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat . As you can tell , with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose . As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over , restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America . Poe , being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is , doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help . It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin ( John Cusack ) and the cavalry can get there . Easier said than done , as double-crosses , suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up . The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic , devastating climax upon another anarchic , devastating climax . At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation . Con Air is everything an action film should be . Steve Buscemi steals the whole show . His deadpan , bug-eyed and dare I say ' innocent ' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film . The scene where he sings with a little girl ( and continues later on ) will either freak you out or steal your heart . And the ending is the best you could hope for . Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud , blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare . It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the ( sadly incomplete ) score CD . And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one . Superior to both The Rock and Face / Off , Con Air is Nic Cage at his ( worst ) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer . See it , for the love of God , see it .
