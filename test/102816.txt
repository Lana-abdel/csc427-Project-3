564649	102816	466909	1.0	A bad sign !	I'm not one of these crazy people who go mental every time Hollywood remakes a movie . Such movies can be appropriate and interesting if they are brought into a contemporary setting or given a new political twist . But for every brilliant Dawn of the Dead there are a million pathetic Wicker Men or The Grudge . It's an easy , lucrative business practise but the shocking thing is how often directors screw it up when the template on how to make a good movie from the material is right there in front of them . Let me begin with saying that The Omen 2006 is , hands down , one of the worst films I have even seen in my life . Simply saying this is an understatement , I left it feeling insulted , offended and angry . But I don't want to waste energy and word-space aptly describing how wretchedly incompetent the film is at absolutely everything so we'll leave it at that . It's been over a decade since I saw the original , I was about 12 when I caught it on TV late one Saturday night . It would probably wouldn't scare me now but I was mildly freaked out by it then . With Richard Donner behind the camera you can rely on it being a strong movie regardless of the scares . Working from , more or less , the exact script , hack , nobody director John Moore hasn't got a rat-arsed clue and makes a mess of this from the very beginning . Ditching the scope-widescreen photography of the original he shoots the film in plain old 1 . 85 : 1 , which would be fine if he did something slightly artistic with it . But instead he gives us the blandest cinematography possible and it looks incredibly TV-movie-ish . Which is weird considering his cheap , Wal-Mart widescreen photography in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix ( another remake ) . Every single ' scare ' he has up his sleeve is no more than an amateurish , simple-minded ' stinger ' which you will ALWAYS see coming because they only ' work ' when they are put into a scene of total silence . So whenever there is a sudden silence in the movie , prepare for the ' boo ' . I can't see any reason why any of the cast would appear in this drek other than the fat paycheck . Liev Schreiber sleepwalks his way through almost entirely monosyllabic role ( or perhaps he's just a terrible actor ) while surrounded by a bunch of equally stupid characters who deserve to die for being so foolish . All the slasher-movie elements are in place here eh ? That's all it is . Considering the material there was so much potential for so much more . How about some insight into the inner workings of heaven and hell ? How about the tiniest bit of plot logic ? Where's the atmosphere ? But no ! They chuck it all away because their imagination and creativity cannot stretch that far and serve up yet another bog-standard , run-of-the-mill crap-fest that will only appeal to brain-dead philistines . Marco Beltrami's generic score ( is this man capable of anything else ? ) is almost as bad Moore's direction ( if you can call it that ) . Once again , here we have so much potential for a great score ( Jerry Goldsmith knew this and won an Academy Award for the original ) , but you need talent to do this or care about the project instead of just being involved for the sake of food and heat . Nobody , NOBODY , from the director all the way down to the dolly grip , gave anything to this far inferior remake . It was a chore to make and a chore to sit through . Of all the terrible remakes that have come and gone in recent years ( it's frightening how many there are now ) this one has to be the most pointless . How stupid do they think we are ? Who on earth would fall for this crap ? John Moore has insulted both God AND The Devil with this garbage . I could give you 666 reasons why you shouldn't watch this movie . But I'm almost out of word-space . Beware !
564849	102816	225703	1.0	Am I the only one who found this really offensive ?	I remember when I was 11 and in Primary Seven ( which works out at Sixth Grade if your American ) when our teacher took the class through to the screening room to watch yet another sex education video . By this point , even as a bunch of 11-year-olds , we were all pretty jaded by this constant sex-ed stuff and rolled our eyes at having to suffer yet more ( this continued all they way to late-High School BTW , which we all found quite odd ) . The video in question that day ( and many days after that ) was Feeling Yes , Feeling No ; a Canadian Stage play acted out in front of kids younger than us on what to do if an adult sexually harasses you . Just say ( or shout ) NO was the answer . It had the sophistication of a 16-mm interstitial on Seasame Street . I remember it vividly to this day . And I remember being very offended by it , along with a lot of the other boys in my class . The reason for this is that every scenario acted out is a man taking advantage of or abusing a girl . I mean , does it never happen the other way around ? Will a woman never abuse a boy ? This aspect was stupidly left out and made the series entirely one-sided and just plain wrong . Honestly . After watching all these us guys felt guilty for no reason . We had done nothing wrong but were made to feel like sexual predators all because of this stupid series . We were all quite downcast for a few days and repeatedly voiced our anger at the teacher who typically ignored us . Even the girls treated us differently , saying stuff like ' You're all rapists . ' Which is just plain wrong no matter what way you look at it . This series of ' educational ' films is wrong and hopelessly sexist . I am sure something this old is not shown in schools anymore and I pray that something more PC ( and trust me , I HATE PC ) is part of sex-ed now . Oh , and what a god-awful ' theme ' song too . I don't think I'll ever get it out of my head . Like the Macarena or Agadoo .
564783	102816	318627	1.0	Really , really bad film !	There was a time , long , long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics , for art , for the Golden Age of Hollywood . Those days are long gone . But at least movies had that special time . Video Games will never be regarded in this way . No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless , degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight . There's no glamour or admiration to be had here . And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together ( whether we like it or not ) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon ( and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role ) . I may sound like I'm talking nonsense , but , when you think about it . . . not really . We've already had a Super Mario Bros . movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat : Annihilation and Alone in the Dark . The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek . Resident Evil : Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead . No joke ! These zombies are not scary ! At all ! Dawn of the Dead this ain't . For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing , why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13 ? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever . The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out . Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard ( conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt ) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection ? And that was only just one part of a ' plot ' that was constant nonsense . And by the end it was so far removed from the ( better ) story of the video games that the ' Resident Evil ' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else . Don't get me started on the characters ! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons . I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but . . . it is . It is totally NOT worth your time or money . Do not even give in to curiosity . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and ( my version had ) Dolby EX / DTS ES 6 . 1 sound . Plus a bunch of extras I care not for .
564559	102816	334541	1.0	Really bad	A surprisingly poor sequel this time . Offering us nothing new and no excitement . Set in the 1800's , the town of Perfection , then called Rejection , is becoming a ghost town because the Graboids are gobbling up all the mine workers . The mine owner ( Hiram Gummer-Burt's ancestor and complete opposite ) comes to town to sort out the problem but proves to be useless . He hires a notorious gunman ( the ever-evil Billy Drago ) but he proves to be useless too . What is weird about this film is that it provides NO set-pieces for our characters to do anything or prove themselves . Nothing happens and the film seems to drag on for ages with long periods of no Graboid action whatsoever . Weird considering it's directed by SS Wilson who did the Tremors 2 and 3 . It doesn't feel like a Tremors film at all . Where's the fun in watching a bunch of period characters learn what we've long known about the mysterious Graboids ? Michael Gross is great as Hiram in regards to playing the complete opposite of what he is popular for and showing some range as an actor . But he just doesn't do anything . There is no reason to watch this film . Plus it's not shot on 35mm film but with a TV camera . The 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic picture proves this only further . It really does look like a feature length episode of the Tremors TV show ( which I don't think I'll get if it's anything like this , assuming it ever comes to DVD at all ) and it's very distracting . The sound is in Dolby 5 . 1 and is quite good during the tunnelling and gunfire scenes but it's not reference quality stuff by any means .
563781	102816	177971	1.0	Very slow and boring	This film was slower than an elderly turtle . Never before have I seen a film that threatened to keel over and die so soon . It takes a healthy 45 minutes before George and Mark get to sea . And when they eventually do it's really not so spectacular . In fact it's slushier and sickeningly sentimental than it is exciting . Plus it's full of very , very bad dialogue . The dialogue is so poor me and my friends were in total hysterics . It was SO bad . The actual storm itself was quite tame to me . The only nauseating thing about it was the idiotically high volume . If a film is not exciting enough in it's basic story the soundtrack has to bombard us deafening noises . The characters made stupid illogical decisions and some don't even do much . The only thing about this film that surprised me was how much William Fichtner has built up his body since Go or Armageddon . Don't see this film for any reason .
564622	102816	95271	1.0	Shockingly bad !	It's frightening to think that if this movie was never made we would never have been subjected to the dreck that is Halloween 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 . And the double shame is that even tho the story here is silly it is at least interesting . The continuation of this was the only decent thing about Halloween 5 and it may well have been good in 6 too but that movie all rearranged and jumbled before it hit out screens . So what we have here is a collection of dull murders with bad story continuity . H20 and Resurrection pretended that 4 , 5 and 6 never happened . There is no REAL backbone or history to this series . All they represent is a producer who asks us to pay money for the same thing over and over . We cannot use photocopied money to pay for our tickets at the box office so the movie-makers owe us something new . And in Halloween 4 we don't get it . In fact I'm sure that to the untrained eye Halloween 4 and 5 could very well be the same movie . And it is SO slow ! Nothing really happens for about 70 minutes worth of the movies 88 minute running time . It leaves you begging for a Jason Voorhees style mass murder spree . That does not happen I'm sorry to say . The movie cuts away at the point of every death and when it doesn't the deaths are dull and boring . A man is thrown onto an electrical power grid and . . . sparks fly . That's it ? How about his face melting or at least getting set on fire ? Plus the body count is shockingly low . What is up with the thumb thru the head ? Not only is it badly shot , too quick and just plain puzzling ( surely a quick neck snap would be easier and nastier ) the physical possibilities of it match hammering a tack into a concrete slab . It just can't happen . I don't care how superhuman Michael Myers unexplained powers are . The whole ' motiveless psycho ' may have worked well in Carpenter's original but here it's asking for money for old rope . Carpenter used it to great effect and scriptwriter Alan B . McElroy ( responsible for some awesome Spawn episodes ) uses it as an excuse for lazy , unimaginative writing . Tho he has the scriptwriters strike to blame as he beat the deadline by mere hours . But even a few hours worth more imagination could have made this the tiniest bit better . There's just not much for Myers to do . He comes out of a coma , goes back to Haddonfield and kills . For no reason . There are no sets other than houses and no opportunity for big excitement or set-pieces . I'm sorry but the ' famous ' rooftop scene is boring , badly rehearsed and badly shot . Director Dwight H . Little ( Marked For Death , Murder at 1600 ) even throws in a 10 second scene in an Elementary school for no reason . Plus the only shot of Michael in this shows him with WHITE hair on his mask . A pretty big goof , lookout for it . Out of all the lessons in how to make an effective horror film that were were taught in the first film none of them are really echoed here . Slasher flicks by their very nature are low brow but Carpenter had a simplistic purity and charm that made it work . Plus he filmed the movie in Panavision which instantly gives it some class . Plus he used the widescreen framing well . Dwight H . Little seems oblivious to this and instead uses standard 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen with no particular flare . And I must mention the very poor dialogue . It offers no insight into the lives of the teenagers in the story or provides them with extra character . Why are we supposed to care when they get killed . It's obvious from the beginning that they are nothing but fodder for Michael Myers . And it's a crime that when they die it's not even graphic or ugly in the slightest . Just boring and badly shot . It's not a horror film because nothing horrifies or upsets other than paying money to see it . Stay well away . Go watch a Friday the 13th movie and see the J-Man do his thing . Anchor Bay presents this DVD in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen . The print is grainy and rather dirty . Nothing of reference quality . Sorry . There soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5 . 1 from the original Ultra Stereo tracks . It's good enough . One hardly expects a sophisticated soundtrack from a film of this nature . In fact I prefer it to the obnoxiously loud sound designs of more recent slasher flicks . A 16 minute documentary , offering new interesting insight to the movie , is included . The participants don't have much to say and seem to regard the film in a higher manner than it deserves . An original theatrical poster replica poses as the cover on a ' 4-page booklet ' ( wow-1 sheet of paper ) containing some more info about the movie . The DVD itself comes in one of those beautiful Limited Edition Tins . My copy is number 05 , , 000 .
563968	102816	450955	1.0	Appalling in every way !	This is pretty much the worst and most over-hyped game of 2005 and made a lot of ' bottom 10 ' lists in many magazines last month . And it bloody deserves it . The problems with this game begin before you even lift it off the shelf in the store . I mean take a look at the cover . It's 50 Cent , one of the few African American ' role models ' around these days , in a defencive pose with a stereotypical ' angry black guy ' look on his face ( oh , please don't hurt me Mr . Cent ! ) . Now I am not a fuddy-duddy conservative who blames people like Marilyn Manson for corrupting kids or whatever because I know kids are more intelligent than adults give them credit for . But America is a very racist country and when 50 Cent misrepresents the Black Community and backs up the xenophobic myth that all Black people are evil or killers or gang-bangers in some way I can't help but get very annoyed . Second of all is the fact that this drivel game is no more than a laughable male fantasy . Yes , I know Mr . Cent has been shot 9 times but it was all at once with low calibre bullets . It's not as if he goes out and gets shot at every day and is immune to all lead fired in the direction of his person . I know 50 Cent has had a really , REALLY , RE-EALLY tough life , that I would not wish upon anyone . But when violence and death have haunted you your whole life the LAST thing you should do is capitalise on a game that glorifies gun-play and gang warfare . That's just disgusting and perverse and if Mr . Cent truly ' kept it real ' ( what a ridiculous , meaningless phrase ) he would treat his demons with respect . Using music as a way of working through them is fine but starring in a video game where the main enjoyment comes from blowing people away certainly is NOT . As I have said , there are few African American role models and he should set an example to those following behind him . While his innovative music may have made him a huge success this game smashes any credibility I feel he may have had . Third ? Well the story to the game is childish and stupid anyway . It's not even entertaining accidentally as it's just way too dull . And fourth ? Well don't get me started on the horrible targeting system and awful controls . It'll make you want to smash your control pad into your TV screen . What a horribly cheaply programmed game ! Fifth ? Well , that would have to be the bland , graphics and tedious environments . It all adds up to a pretty ( read VERY ) unsatisfying experience . Mere days after being released most stores had zillions of copies traded in as those foolish enough to buy it blind quickly discovered what a rotten game it is as well as a hideously over-indulgent and grossly misjudged vanity piece . BEWARE ! ! ! Graphics C Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
564781	102816	257076	1.0	Dumb and not entertainingly dumb either	Ugh ! SWAT is a miserable film . I remember when I was a kid and I'd play at Cops and Robbers with other kids . We'd run around with invisible guns indiscriminately shooting at each other . SWAT has that same mentality and is aimed at the same age group . It's not a movie , it's shamefully disguised pro-NRA propaganda . For all the gun glorification and random violence ( PG-13 rated violence remember , as they want to expose this drivel to the little kiddies ) there is not one subtle moment that tells us guns are dangerous . Here they are just toys and shooting people is just fun . I shouldn't really complain so hard as for the first whole hour of this film NOTHING happens . It's all devoted to pointless character building which never rises past clichéd stereotypes ( Michelle Rodriguez expands her range by playing an unhappy , scowling Latino-something she hasn't played before ) and is totally ditched with the abrupt , anti-climatic ending . SWAT promises action and the not-quite high concept plot of a crime-lord offering anyone who can break him out of custody a $100 million reward is never fully realised . We could have had 2 whole hours of excitement but we barely get 45 minutes . It's a slow , boring film with absolutely NOTHING to recommend it . Plus it all seems very 70's . I felt embarrassed watching it . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . There are extras but do I care ?
564519	102816	163983	1.0	Uneventful Trash	I only saw this film because my girlfriend wanted to and I did try hard to enjoy it but it sucked big time . There are so many plot holes and hard to swallow plot elements . For example are we really supposed to believe that Kim Basinger is the sister of someone who is about 24 years younger than her ? What on earth was that evil nanny supposed to be ? What was the point in taking Cody to the dentist ? And why did this film build up to such an unsatisfying climax ? For a film that tried to draw its power from supernatural hokum the ending was spectacularly ordinary . The acting was exceptionally poor throughout and I am very surprised that Chuck Russell churned out such a piece of manufactured garbage . If you take equal parts of Rosemary's Baby , Devil's Advocate , End of Days and that awful Winona Ryder film Lost Souls , mix it up with a large dose of badly recorded ADR ( 99 % of the film's dialogue ) and you have this film . It might have been better if Christina Ricci had been in it more . I swear , she must have been in it for about 5 minutes absolute max . I also must mention the absurdly fake SFX that polluted the whole film . What were those flying demons supposed to be anyway ? I give this film a big
564809	102816	329717	1.0	Flatliner	This film couldn't be flatter . Even if you stomped it into the ground , went over it with a steamroller and landed a plane on it . Even as a bog-standard 80's direct-to-video , el-cheapo cop-thriller this would be the crap-de-la-crap . Hollywood Homicide ( rubbish title ! ) thankfully and fortunately flopped big time in the summer of 2003 . Though the audience who said ' no ' to this were probably the same people who contributed to Bad Boys 2 ( and equally terrible film from the same writer ) being a success . Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett play cops who moonlight as a real estate broker and yoga instructor . But Hartnett has aspirations to be an actor too ( the irony is somewhat lost on him ) and ends up yelling lines from A Streetcar Named Desire whenever he can . Oh stop it ! My sides are splitting ! After a couple of rappers are gunned down in a nightclub they investigate . Ron Shelton manages to stretch out this incredibly NON-existent plot for very painful , very boring 115 minutes . It tries to be funny , and thinks it is , but this arrogance only amplifies the tediousness of the rank-amateur script . I kid you not ; I could have got a 12-year-old , hyper on Buzz Cola , to write something better and more professional . Hollywood Homicide is Unbelievably bad . And , I never thought I'd say this , it actually makes Showtime look good in comparison . The DVD is 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5 . 1 sound . There are extras but I couldn't care less coz this film is rotten .
564650	102816	348121	2.0	Worst animated film I have EVER seen .	To think I could have just rented Steamboy and got it over and done with . But it was only the UK Theatrical cut that was available to rent and with a Director's Cut available in a limited edition box set out there I had to be a snob and go buy that . What a complete waste of money . Steamboy is a steaming pile of crap ! The only thing I liked about it was the quaint depiction of olden-days English countryside . The rest was so phenomenally boring , that I was almost falling asleep . James Ray Steam ( voiced by Anna Paquin , sounding more like a Gaelic South-African than a boy from Manchester ) is the grandson of some good scientist and the son of some bad scientist . . . blah blah blah . . . steam power . . . blah blah blah . . . war machines . Christ almighty , I am sending myself into terminal coma even summarising this guff ! The cover makes it look like some sort of exciting superhero story . But all of the action happens in the last 10 minutes . Everything before this is so , so unbelievably slow . Every line of dialogue so flat . Every character bland as living hell . I wish to erase this film from my memory forever and I am extremely bitter over the 2 hours I WASTED watching it .
564806	102816	99052	3.0	All over way to quick	This film ends before anything happens and really doesn't have much going on in it . The whole film seems to be too contrived and way too many events are foreshadowed in a very obvious way . I mean when Jeff Daniels is in his basement and he finds all of the rotten wood with his nail gun . Okay ? rotten wood that will have significance perhaps and the nail gun ? a last ditch weapon against the spiders ? How unsubtle ! The spiders themselves are not very scary as they are practically non-existent thru out the whole film . There are a couple here and there who bite a couple of people who then die . But nothing of interest . Julian Sands ' character is useless and serves no purpose other than to go into a barn he knows is crawling with killer spiders and get bitten himself . What an idiot ! Why ? John Goodman is barely recognisable under a stupid helmet and his dialogue is barely intelligible . The townspeople are clichéd and stereotyped . I mean come on ! They refer to Jeff Daniels as " big city folks " . Way too much time is devoted to Jeff Daniels trying to build a reputation as a doctor and dealing with the Sheriff ( who is a moron , would you believe ) and a rival old Doctor and not enough give to kicking of eight-legged ass . We only see about 3 spiders actually get killed . The rest are , conveniently , done off-screen . People tend to refer to this film as a thrillomedy . No ! It's just dull and uneventful . 104 minutes of absolutely nothing . It's also made in 1 . 85 : 1 , which is never a good thing . Check out William Shatner's Kingdom of the Spiders . That is much better .
564834	102816	117500	3.0	Michael Bay does himself no favours	After massively misjudging the scale of Pearl Harbor and reducing it to no more than a video-game recital of a very important historical event , he will have to work extremely hard to win back the tiny shred of credibility he started out with . Following up that garbage with the even worse Bad Boys II wasn't a wise move . The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth . It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting . General Francis Xavier Hummel ( Ed Harris ) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team - what team ? - is paid $1 , 000 , 000 . I mean , if he is prepared to do that then why not just sell them to some militia , or freedom fighter group ? A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent , named Stanley Goodspeed ( Nicolas Cage ) , is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz . But wait , there's more . Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls . They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out . Or break in . And so enters the philosophising and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason ( Sean Connery ) at about 45 minutes into the movie . He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't have an extreme reaction at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long . There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business . And it's a car chase in San Francisco , so you know what that means . Once on the island , the SEALS , as predicted , are crap and get killed instantly . So , basically , Hummel wants to honour his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers . How absurd . Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and , in real life , there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless . Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing . Cage cannot make Goodspeed likable no matter how skilled an actor he may be . He's a complete coward . Annoying . Unfunny . The words he says don't sound right coming from his mouth . When he tries to be tough , he just seems ridiculous . Mason is just an old James Bond . Hell , he's even a British Secret Agent . The role was written with Connery in mind , so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool . They involve themselves in a variety of set-pieces before being captured by Hummel , who's mission is not going well . The FBI doesn't want to cough up the money and would rather flatten Alcatraz and its 81 civilian hostages than part company with a few million dollars . Nice . This subplot is , of course , used to generate tension and excitement and to goose up the already overstuffed turkey that is the plot . Coherent editing is not this movie's strength . In fact , coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock . There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into an MTV blur . The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway , which results in The Rock becoming a huge , clumsy , oafish movie , with little in the way of sense or reality . There are a few entertaining aspects though . Hans Zimmer's score is truly um . . . rocking . The supporting cast is interesting and delivers far more tolerable performances than Cage or Connery . Some of the Alcatraz sets are nice to look at , as well . But , if this is the best thing one can say about an action movie , then one needs to consider something else . Released in the June , 1996 , The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie released the month before . Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension . In 135 minutes , it wastes no time on sub-plotting , develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting . Exec Dec is played straight . The Rock is played to look cool and hip . It's not . Oh and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been - years-old when his character first crossed Mason .
564602	102816	220506	3.0	Waste of time !	Even though most of them are rubbish , the Halloween movies always seem so full of potential when the lights go down and the film fades in to that ominous and slicker-than-crude-oil theme tune . Sadly though , they never attempt anything other than stabbings . John Carpenter's original low-budget horror flick , about a babysitter stalked by the bogey man , was a big hit that brought him much acclaim . A sequel was inevitable . Carpenter even worked on it . But after that , he bowed out and his producer Moustapha Akkad took over . He's not a filmmaker , he's a businessman . And for 24 years , he has served us the same sandwich , over and over . Rick Rosenthal , who directed Halloween II , is back behind the camera . One would assume that his familiarity with the franchise is a good thing . Too bad he's obsessed with cheesy lighting , obnoxiously loud sound effects and confusing editing . This film was supposed to be released in the autumn of 2001 , but apparently there were major differences of opinion when the director of H20 , Steve Miner , started fiddling with the finished print . The original title , Halloween : The Homecoming , was dropped because Dimension Films wanted a title that made it clear that Michael Myers was still alive . So they nicked half the title off an Alien movie and stuck it on . There is only one way to tell a story of teenagers being murdered by a psycho in a William Shatner mask / hockey mask / pillow case . And you've seen it a zillion times . The only minuscule difference this one offers is that the whole thing in broadcast on the Internet , which provides room for some gimmicky , if annoying , set pieces and a few clever tricks . But don't expect jaw-dropping twists , or intensity . An ambitious reality show producer ( Busta Rhymes ) sets up the Myers house with booby-traps and red herrings to juice his sleepover Internet show . A handful of teens , with stereotypical personalities , fall for it and deliver the goods . Until Mikey comes back , that is . What's that you say ? Surely , Mikey can't be alive after Jamie Lee lopped his head off in H20 ? Well , the movie says that Michael stuck his mask onto someone else before being chucked into the back of the corpse-mobile . Umm . . . so where's the actual " resurrection " ? What follows is a shlocky assortment of teenage slayings - Freddy , Mikey and Jason must surely have laid waste to most of teen America by now - and massacres . What motivates Mikey ? Never revealed , man . Carpenter used this to good effect first time round . Parts 4 , 5 and 6 - they dropped the roman numerals after III - added truckloads of story to the Michael Myers myth , which , although nothing but hokum , was at least interesting . H20 completely disregarded those movies and went back to killing for no reason . And now once again , it's just pointless bloodshed . Mikey isn't scary . Jason would flatten him in a second . You know that he's always going to get up after being hung , shot , stabbed , poisoned , fired out of a cannon or run over with a steam roller . There is zero suspense . Watching a rubber dog-doo machine make rubber dog-doo is not interesting . And watching a killing machine kill got boring well over a decade ago . It's time to try something new . Halloween : Resurrection tries a little harder , perhaps . And for this reason , it's one of the better sequels . But it's still a big jive turkey in need of a valuable lesson . Horror films should offend and disgust , not regurgitate the failures of previous sequels .
564139	102816	295297	4.0	Quite boring !	One might imagine that because Chris Columbus pulled off a faithful , yet exciting , movie adaptation of the first Harry Potter adventure that he would be able to it a second time . I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not . There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it . More than two-and-a-half hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium - only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained . The story has a slightly harder tone than the first , but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age . Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays . He longs to go back to Hogwarts , but a Jar-Jar Binks lookalike elf , called Dobby , turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there . It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry , as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer . Once Harry gets to school - by means of a flying Ford Anglia - his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil . Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can . And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh , totally miscast ) , who is not as funny as in the book . Five minutes after we are re-introduced to the students and teachers , the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting . First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids . But there's no excusing it now . They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong - I know , I know , they're only kids . Trust me , none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon , which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch . Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris , Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith - Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused - they cannot handle the weight of the material . Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice . Steven Kloves ' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J . K . Rowling's book - once again , Rik Mayall is completely left out - in order to keep a tight pace . Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring . Nothing REALLY happens . And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes - an absolute crime in a film of this length . With the exception of the chamber of secrets - which holds precious few secrets , I might add - no part of Hogwarts is explored . Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle . The lighting is conveniently yellow-candlelit , when he wants it to be mysterious , or comfortable , and green , or blue , when it should be menacing . Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before . There's nothing visually disturbing , but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame , family friendly blockbuster . Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown , there is nothing of interest . The mystery is very weak and straight-forward . There is too much talk and not enough action . It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series , which has so far been equally as dull . All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here . Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end . This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style , to force the audience to cry ( Home Alone , Bicentennial Man ) .
564235	102816	353333	4.0	Simple and Slow	Don't get me wrong , I love Darkwing Duck ( where is the series on DVD ? ) but this game does not do him justice . The graphics are nice and look wonderful on a wide TV screen but it's a stiff and slow game to play . What really rattled my chain is that too often a baddie , who is nowhere near you , will take health off you even though he doesn't touch you . Forget ducking ( heh heh ) out of the way in time because the game is too slow to react . And there is practically no way of attacking the baddies apart from using the gas gun , which has no affect on most of them and runs out pretty quickly . The story is quite good though and for all that it is pretty to look at and family-friendly it's the gameplay that really lets this one down . I played the Turbo-Grafx version , which has better graphics than the NES and is a more fleshed-out game . But it's the gameplay that matters and if the NES version isn't as stiff then perhaps you should get that one instead of hunting down the increasingly elusive Turbo-Grafx version . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
563818	102816	120655	4.0	Who's your buddy ?	I'll admit it ; I have never seen any other Kevin Smith movie aside from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . And even in that movie his lack of class and tendency for cheap vulgarity kind of turns me off him . Despite some moments of ( often childish ) humor ( any bit with Jay and Silent Bob and the cool ' new ' Jesus image ) , Dogma mostly fails on every one of its intentions . Rather than the ' epic ' most people are calling this film I consider it to be way overlong and overbearingly self-indulgent . It seems that Kevin Smith has a savage and acidicly cynical view of the Catholic Church and rather than making a movie that unravels any hypocrisies or sheds light on double standards he's made a sprawling shambles that too often goes off in lumbering tangents ( one of Smith's constant failings ) . There's nothing unsubtle or smooth about Dogma . No class or dignity . The dialogue may be considered as biting satire to the casual viewer , but it's actually increasingly tiresome and nothing more than exposition . I kid you not ; over 90 % of the dialogue in this film is expositional and bores to tears . There's nothing worse than Chris Rock , Linda Fiorentino and Selma Hayek rambling on and on and on with nothing happening and still they go on and on and on and on and on . . . I cannot believe that there are 100 minutes of deleted scenes from this movie . How on earth the full cut of this movie was tolerated by even the editors is a mystery to me . Proof positive that Kevin Smith has no control over his ' creative ' tantrum . There is also the bonus of having the WORST musical score in history ( and that includes Harry Manfredini's jarring noises in Jason Goes To Hell ) . What a horrible , headache-inducing drone it was ! The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound , so now you can enjoy that awful score in its full glory on your home theatre . A plethora of extras are , for some reason , included on this DVD . Which is only further proof that the film thinks it's far better than it actually is . There are ' real ' good movies that don't get this many extra features on DVD and I assure you I have no intention of knowing more of this film .
564371	102816	143145	4.0	No excitement	Probably the least exciting Bond movie ever made and that's including the Lazenby one . Nothing happens that is worth mentioning . There's a scene with a pipe or something that is good for about 2 seconds . The rest is an unbroken succession of bore after bore after bore . How on earth the filmmakers thought that audiences would be entertained by this is a mystery to me . Robert Carlyle is so unscary he belongs in Sesame Street . Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist ( ! ) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat . Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible . Watch this movie only if you are a Bond fan . If you watch them just like any other movie though . . . do NOT waste your cash .
564567	102816	422335	4.0	Generic first person shooter	I'm really rather sick of first person shooter games . They are a dime a dozen and with all the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games out there do we really need another ? The previous game in the Bond universe was Everything or Nothing , which wasn't a first person shooter , something new . But this one goes back to something old . There is a bit of a twist though . It's fun to play a villain , there's a little bit of RPG ( only a touch ) and the villains from the older movies ( such as Dr No , Blofeld , Oddjob , Goldfinger and Francisco Scaramanga ) come back , even though they are supposed to be very , very , long , long dead . But this novelty didn't last long and I quickly became bored of the game . Plus there is too much going on . Hooked up to a home theatre this game is loud and thrilling but it will easily induce epileptic seizures so beware . Plus the targeting is terrible . If you have a gun that sprays bullets everywhere you will still have trouble killing a lone enemy in the distance . This got highly irritating . As these type of games go even Die Hard : Vendetta was better . Nice music though . Rent it to try it out first as buying blind would be a serious error in judgment .
564810	102816	58472	4.0	One Cool Cat	The Pink Panther is cool as cool can be . And so funny and cute . In this cartoon he observes some little dude painting a house blue . Preferring Pink to Blue he goes about sabotaging the painter's work . Every where the painter paints in blue , the Panther paints in Pink . Sounds simple and not funny , but it's hilarious . The Pink Panther cannot be outsmarted , he's just always way ahead of the game and in the end he inevitably wins and claims the now pink house for himself . And why not ? Though only 40 years old and not really as well established as the Looney Tunes cartoons The Pink Panther is surely one of THE classic animated characters .
564177	102816	371816	4.0	I don't like racing games .	So maybe I'm the wrong person to be doing a review . But they are all basically the same and while Double Dash looks pretty it does little to further the genre . The graphics are , quite simply , gorgeous . Mario Kart Double Dash shows what the Gamecube is capable of with brilliant colors , wonderful landscapes and vivid race courses . The sound isn't up to much though . Sound effects are kind of generic and the music is hardly a standout . Pretty much , if racing games are for you then Mario Kart Double Dash is essential if you have a Gamecube . I couldn't care less about this genre so I can gladly never play again , no matter how stunning it looks .
564686	102816	29237	4.0	Boring and predictable	Mickey cartoons all follow the same formula . Whatever he's doing will soon fall into chaos as soon as Donald shows up or whatever he's in charge of inexplicable rebels . In this cartoon , nothing is different . He's hosting an amateur music show on the radio and Donald forgets the lyrics to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star . He's not happy about being booed and won't give up even after being kicked off . Clara Cow ( or whoever ) and Goofy turn up with some failed acts ( both interrupted by Donald ) that go haywire in the most predictable of fashions . Not that funny and not that interesting . So much so that I did the hoovering while watching it .
564807	102816	103644	4.0	Theatrical cut is miserable as hell , see the extended version .	In regards to the version that was released in cinemas . . . miss it . That's for damn sure . This was the first film that David Fincher directed and it has that dark , smelly and grimy look that he is only capable of . After the highly exciting Aliens there is ZERO entertainment here and only one Alien . Very fake looking and largely unseen for most of the movie . Apparently the Alien Queen laid one last face hugger egg on the Marine ship ( didn't she already detach herself from her birth tunnel thingy ) . The egg hatches and lays another Alien egg in Ripley , which just happens to be a queen . For a reason , which is unclear to us , the face hugger sprays acid on the ship , which catches fire and breaks off the cryo-tube section . This sends Ripley , Newt , Hicks and Bishop crashing down onto a lice-infected prison planet called Furiona 161 . Just for the hell of it ( it seems ) Newt , Hicks and Bishop are killed off because the film is deliberately miserable as it possibly can be . Weaver is the only female character in it and is very much indistinctive among the rest of the indistinctive cast as she is bald-headed ( because of the Lice problem ) with a bunch of bald-headed guys who all appear to be English and ugly . There is another face hugger ( so the Queen laid 2 eggs before it died ? ) that the prisoners seem to miss as they rescue Ripley . It impregnates a dog and a new Alien is born in the form of a canine , giving us the impression that the beast mimics the form of the creature that became its host . We are supposed to observe this as it is never cleared up in dialogue . There are numerous scenes in which Ripley ( or bald-headed prisoners ? I can't tell ) run down damp corridors ( or perhaps the same one over and over ) being chased by the Alien . But for budget reasons we don't actually SEE the Alien , just its point of vision . Characters are killed with no care , passion or meaning to their deaths and how the hell anyone believed that an audience of any kind would enjoy this film is beyond my great understanding . It is so bad that Fincher didn't get work for 3 years after this until he was called upon to direct Se7en . The only reason he got to do that is because it is a depressing and ugly film , much like this . The extended version featured on the Special Edition DVD is a far superior version of the film , though not a director's cut or without faults , it's the best version of the film you're likely to see . Characters are fleshed out , sense-making scenes are restored and the creature is born out of a dead ox instead of a dog . It doesn't sound like much but it almost changes it into a completely new and more satisfying film . Either or depending on the version you watch . overall .
564069	102816	36680	4.0	A distinct lack of laughs .	In this cartoon the Three Bears sit at the dinner table in their ramshackle hut and think of a way to temp some unwitting fool into the cauldron . That unwitting fool ends up being Bugs Bunny . But , as usual , he's to clever to fall for any tricks . Too bad the outsmarting isn't really so funny or clever . It definitely wasn't the funniest Bugs I've ever seen . I was kind of bored with it very quickly as the start is also kind of slow and humor is not up to scratch . Plus the animation of the Three Bears looks kind of rough and ragged and really distracts your attention . Don't bother going out your way to catch this ' un .
564641	102816	93393	5.0	Very Weird and strange	This film seems to be a bizarre hybrid of David Lynch at his most weirdest and Jim Jarmush on an acid trip . There is no linear progression or any character development . Or any real characters when I think about it . Or story . Just a very strange mixture of disgusting visuals and gay imagery . For the first half of the movie we linger on a bunch of hobos in a demolished wasteland . We can't really tell if they are just living in an old factory or if the world has been destroyed by nuclear apocalypse . These scenes are tinted ( or flooded ) by either red , green or blue . The guys just walk around and stuff . Nothing special . I don't know why I didn't walk out of this movie . Obviously some part of it held my attention . I don't know what though . What's even stranger is that I WOULD recommend this film to others . If you like movies it's a good idea to see a few bizarre ones . If you don't like it that's fine . But I bet you can't fully explain WHY you don't like it . I can't explain why I even sat thru it . It's good to see . Even though it doesn't have the normal things associated with movies . IE script , producer and well ? I dunno . Not much dialogue either .
563811	102816	160236	5.0	Better than I expected	I though this film was going to be nothing but juvenile nonsense . How pleased I was when I discovered that it was a lot livelier and energetic than I predicted . The voice-over never once annoyed me as I thought it would and everyone in this movie seems to go overboard with their characters . Yet , despite all the energy and frenetic comedy , the film never feels indulgent . The plot is , of course , nonsense . But then again you hardly want a family movie to have a labyrinth plot . Dudley Do-Right may have flopped but I don't know why . It's in the same field as the terrible " Waterboy " but that made over $100 , 000 , 000 . This I won't understand . Maybe it's only because Canadians will truly love the intellectually-challenged Mountie .
564529	102816	309698	5.0	Engaging thriller that deflates halfway through	Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller . As 10 strangers ( including John Cusack , Ray Liotta , John C . McGinley , Clea Duvall , Rebecca DeMornay , Amanda Peet , Jake Busey ) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm , suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst . Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far , far away from the motel . For about 60 minutes , this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked . Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax . I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming . But it came too early and led the film into stupidness . It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool , even if it doesn't last very long . But , in the end , I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this . But what do you expect from a film written by the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2 : Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . There are a bunch of extras I don't care about .
564856	102816	291715	5.0	An okay platformer . . .	. . . though increasingly tedious and a bit dull . As usual for film tie-ins of the time it had little do with the story of Alien 3 . Ripley runs about with a big gun ( there were no guns in the film ) shooting at loads of aliens ( there was only one in the film ) through many different levels . While the levels looks good and had a decent atmosphere about them it looked nothing like the Fury-161 prison / refinery of the movie and all you really did in them was jump from platform to platform and go up and ladders . Occasionally a Xenomorph would rush and knock you over if you didn't blow it away . It became really boring after a while and only those with seriously nothing better to do would be able to stick it out until the end . And why is Ripley alive at the end ?
564441	102816	38259	5.0	More like ' The Woman in Black and White '	A serial killer on the streets of London has Scotland Yard in a panic . Inspector Gregson ( replacing Lestrade , who is obviously not suited to this kind of story ) asks Holmes for help . On the case for only a few minutes , Holmes already makes keen observations and quickly deduces that it all must be the devilish work of Professor Moriarty . . . again . He's already died twice in these movies and another third time before this story is set . It annoys me that he's always so prominently featured in many Sherlock Holmes films when he really was no more than a come-and-go character in Conan-Doyle's stories . Henry Daniell is really bad as Moriarty and comes across as wimpy and effeminate . Not exactly a good approach , this ain't no pantomime . The reason behind the murders is also quite contrived and nonsensical and there's only a little bit of a mysterious atmosphere . A cheap and silly Holmes movie and certainly the lowest point so far for Rathbone and Bruce .
563850	102816	82763	5.0	Just . . . weird	I never really got into this movie , it's more strange than it is funny . And Chevy wasn't his usual self either , he was way to morose and distant to really side with his character or empathise with him in any way . Chevy plays Max Fielder , an air-traffic controller who's life is constantly in the toilet and bad luck follows him everywhere . He's very paranoid and possessive over his girlfriend , so much so that she dumps him for some total dork . On his way home from a disastrous night out his car is sprayed with radioactive gunk from a leaky government truck . He is soon blessed / cursed with telekinetic abilities , which he uses to get revenge on those who make his life miserable . It could have been really fun but it's just . . . weird . Ken Shapiro ( who ? ) does not have the same edge in his direction as Harold Ramis , Michael Ritchie or John Landis and he doesn't know how to fully use Chevy's brand of humor . There are some laughs to be had though , but their not so memorable . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen but it's mostly all shot in soft focus so there's nothing outstanding here . The sound is plain old Mono and it's alright if nothing else , though the dialogue has very heavy use of ADR . A trailer and TV spot are included . Oh . . . and that theme song playing over the menu , opening and closing credits ? Yuck !
564626	102816	109040	6.0	Funny , but lacking in plot	This is the movie that really kick-started the careers of Jim Carrey and , to a lesser extent , Courteney Cox although it is Carrey who makes this movie all his own by his wild and energetic performance as a half-insane Pet Detective . In case you're wondering that's a detective who tracks down missing animals . Ace is a great character , with his wacky clothes , groovy swagger , wild hair ( LOVE that do ) and unpredictable behaviour . He's a page right out of Howlin ' Mad Murdock's biography . Courteney Cox plays a boss for the Miami Dolphins who hires Ace to find their missing cetacean mascot Snowflake . They can't play without having their mascot y ' know . It's paper thin and despite lasting about 85 minutes , it is stretched too far . What could have been a half decent plot soon descends into lame-brain juvenile humor as Ace does his class clown bit , offends many people and uncovers stupid and unfunny ' plot ' twists . Tom Shadyac tries his best to make the film look colorful and vivid and , for the most part , succeeds but sometimes the production design looks a bit shoddy and I have no idea who allowed Sean Young to be in this movie . She's a terrible actress and makes every scene damn painful to watch . However , she is quite a MILF these days . Not in this movie though . There are some funny scenes and easy to see why Carrey went on to become such a big star but compared to the rest of Carrey's career it's a bit of an insult to his talent . I prefer the sequel , even though Ace is a full blown lunatic in it and appears a tiny bit more normal and human in this one . A fun movie to watch once in a long while . Not something to rely on for never-ending appeal .
564765	102816	1087900	6.0	Fun filler , nothing more than that	Fans of RE 0 , 1 and 3 will no doubt get a kick out of this game . All of the key locations from these three entries get revisited and almost fully destructible in this rail-shooter . I ain't no fan of rail shooter games . They were fine back in the days of Operation Wolf but nowadays they remind me too much of those awfully dated ( and seemingly endless ) House of the Dead games . I was a little wearing when purchasing RE : TUC but I knew it would be far superior to the other zombie shooter . In between the rehashed levels you get to play as Wesker and find up what he was up to behind the scenes of the original games . If you unlock enough weapons and files you can also play a bonus level set in an industrial facility owned by Umbrella in the Russian snowy wastelands . Some levels take a lot of repeating until you get the right combination of weapons and perfect the timing but not to the point that you'll be chucking your remote at the wall . I am terrible at these kind of games and I still managed it . What disappointed me the most was the total lack of any kind of atmosphere . But it's not really that kind of game . RE : TUC is for those craving a dose of mindless violence rather than a problem-solving thinker . But when you unlock absolutely everything there ain't much reason to go back to the game . It's basically just something to keep the fans from starving until RE5 comes out , whenever that will be . One thing's for sure , it won't be on the Wii .
564015	102816	91369	6.0	Not as good as dark crystal .	Coming a couple of years after the far more accomplished Dark Crystal this is relatively straight-forward but still a helluva lot more imaginative than any family movie of recent years . You could call it a modern fairy tale , but it's just not deep enough . And for a film called Labyrinth , it's strangely uncomplicated . Jennifer Connelly ( younger and prettier , though her acting is questionable ) stars as Sarah , a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world . Her dad and stepmother go out , leaving her to babysit her baby brother . Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell , wishing the goblins to take him away . Sure as sugar , the Goblin King himself ( Tina Turner , oh sorry . . . I mean David Bowie ) turns up and takes away the screaming tot . In order to get him back she must solve ' The Labyrinth ' ( cue dramatic music ) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours . Along the way she meets new friends ( of the Jim Henson variety ) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf , big , hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus . It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems . The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire . Most specifically , his trousers , they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement . You'll cringe , you'll avert your eyes , yet you'll be mesmerized . Come on , how could this have been allowed in a family movie . Plus , Trevor Jones ' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot . It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic . But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI . There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry ( or is that Muppetry ? ) that no computer graphic can generate . The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly . And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit . Filmed in Panavision , the 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture looks good . But not exceptionally so . Columbia are so hyped up over their Superbit releases . And that's fine when considering newer movies . But for a film like Labyrinth we really should have a brand new , hi-def remastering . THAT would have looked super . What we have however is just a good-looking movie . There's hardly any grain , no dirt ( surprising considering the age of the print ) and perfect colors . Originally recorded in Dolby Stereo , the first DVD release was in 2 . 0 surround only . For this Superbit release Columbia have given us a full 5 . 1 track in Dolby Digital and DTS . How does it sound ? Like 2 . 0 surround . There is hardly any deep bass . It's front speaker biased , with little or no surround use and there's practically no difference between the Dolby or DTS tracks . We could have been given a full 6 . 1 track with stronger remastering of the original sound elements . How cool would that be ? As this is a Superbit , there are no extras . The original DVD release had an hour long documentary on it . But this Superbit is only slightly better in quality , so it's up to you to decide which one you want . Also , there is a Collector's Edition which includes this version plus loads more .
564454	102816	220099	6.0	Cool movie .	But it should have been a bit longer . 77 minutes is not enough . I have always loved Disney's animation of the Winnie the Pooh TV show and I was way excited when I first learned of this movie . 100 acre wood looks as magical as it always has done and is presented very well in this feature . The story itself is a bit childish but still manages to have balls when it has Tigger FAIL to find his family . Although I would have liked him too I respect the ending they went for . Although this film isn't to everyone's tastes ( I know it seems a little fruity a guy of 20 can like this film ) I say you should see this movie , preferably with kids . It's perfect child fodder and good entertainment . Not just family entertainment . Should be longer though .
563843	102816	37168	6.0	The Pearl of Blandness	There's not a hell of a lot of mystery or suspense in this Holmes movie , I'm sorry to say . The sets , the characters and the plot are all so generic and ordinary that nothing really stands out . It begins with Holmes successfully recovering a priceless stolen pearl ( wow , what an amazing macguffin ) from a bunch of thieves and returning it to it's rightful owner . But , in a moment of arrogance , he disables the alarm at the museum when he points out the security faults and the pearl is stolen again by some arch-villain who fails to impress and probably wouldn't even say boo to a goose in real life . The usual questions and snooping around follow with Lestrade acting like a moron and Watson bumbling around in the background . I'm grateful that this one doesn't have any silly WWII sentiment in it but , once again , it is clearly filmed on Universal's medieval Europe set which looks and feels absolutely nothing like London . Did you know that I have , so far , not seen Big Ben in any one one of these Rathbone / Bruce movies . Even some stock footage spliced in there would make it just the tiniest bit more authentic . And what's the fascination with Pearls anyway ? It's just a marble made by an oyster .
564001	102816	32401	6.0	No laughs	Out in his garden , Donald builds a huge dog bath machine with loads of pulleys and scrubs . Why he would want to subject Pluto to this behemoth instead of washing him normally I don't know but it's obviously Pluto ain't gonna be up for this . The dog himself is snoozing in his nearby kennel and Donald must trick him into going into the bath with a rubber bone on a string and then a puppet of a kitten . Pluto doesn't fall for it and the highly expected ending of Donald falling into it proves true . Only he's too happy that his craftsmanship has actually worked to be annoying . It's not that funny but the vivid and inventive animation makes up for it .
564549	102816	314498	6.0	Mild , entertaining distraction	There's lots of clichés and stereotypes to endure when watching a high school movie . For the most of it , The Perfect Score manages to avoid most of these clichés though the characters are a bit stereotypical . There's the brainy kid , the rebel , the stoner , the loser , the jock and the good guy . Hardly a breathtaking assortment of originals eh ? But their plan to steal the SAT scores and their interaction together are what make this movie worthwhile . The unimaginative marketing for this movie claims it to be Ocean's 11 meets The Breakfast Club . But the actors are carrying the movie , doing the best they can with weak material , rather than the ' wild ' premise . I especially liked Roy , the stoner and narrator as he got the most back story and had more a character arc than the rest of them . And it was pleasant to have the lovely , oh-so-cute Erika Christensen though I'm not too fussed about Scarlett Johansen ( she looks like a teenage version of my mother ! ) . A non-Shaggy , but still manic , Matthew Lillard has a small role as a concerned big brother . You'll not remember it 5 minutes after the credits role but for a non-threatening , easy-going movie The Perfect Score fits nicely . You could do a helluva lot worse . And what else do you expect from an MTV movie ? The DVD is in 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with lackluster Dolby 5 . 1 , though to be fair it mostly a dialogue-driven movie . There are a bunch of fluff features for those who care .
564516	102816	32455	6.0	Ambitious and well-intentioned , but ultimately a misfire	Fuelled with the noble ambition of bringing classical music to a wider audience , especially children , Fantasia succeeds and fails in equal amounts . Some of it works , some it bores . It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out . The first segment is enough to put you off completely . We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played ( Toccata and Fugue in D Minor ) . Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player . This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques . I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking ' What the hell is this ? ' The three good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring , the over publicised Sorcerer's Apprentice , The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain . All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation . Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos ( The Pastoral Symphony ) or the ' meet the soundtrack ' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all , I'm sorry to say . The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons usually are . But ultimately , Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate . Still worth checking out though .
564293	102816	401398	6.0	An entertaining , though weakly plotted sequel	First of all , let me just say that Kronk's New Groove is very , very funny with a good amount of laugh out loud moments . Surely that is all that matters then , eh ? Well , no . Compared to the first film , the story is pretty tepid . All of the previous characters return . Of course there is Kronk himself , along with Kuzco , Pacha and his family , the babbling squirrel and Yzma ( who has now turned mostly back into a ' human ' but still features a cat's tail and feline abilities . The movie tries to incorporate all of them into the story but nothing really sticks . It all just seems like an excuse for mayhem . As before , it is told in flashback with Kronk explaining how he ended up in such sorry circumstances . His dad is coming to visit him and he's afraid of the inevitable disapproval he'll get as all he's managed to do with his life is be a Junior Chipmunk Troup Leader and run a restaurant kitchen . His dad thinks that cooking and talking to animals isn't a ' real job ' and won't give Kronk the big thumbs up until he's got his own house on a hill with loads of money . From this thin idea comes loads of deception , scheming and hijinks . And that's basically the movie . It IS packed full of hilarious moments and wonderful Looney Tunes-inspired humor like the first , but it just lacks that overall high-quality . Still , it's loads of fun and any fan of The Emperor's New Groove must give it a rent .
564827	102816	162222	6.0	Could have been great	Robert Zemeckis should know better than to make this the way he did . The scenes on the island are very cool and attractively shot but why on earth was this film made in 1 . 85 : 1 ? Zemeckis did Forrest Gump , Contact and What Lies Beneath in 2 . 35 : 1 so why not this film ? The beautiful island location would have been so much cooler if it were . But still it beats ' The Beach ' any day . The starting is a little slow but the sudden decompression of the FedEx plane is quite nerve-wracking . This is the point is which the movie really gets going and the crash is incredible . It's hard not to wince when Hanks is injured repeatedly as he struggles for survival and the sound effects of it really make you squirm . The creation of Wilson as Hanks hurts his hand is quite cool too . But it's heartbreaking when Wilson floats away . It really was the saddest moment of the film . Other cool moments include a scene in which a surfacing whale opens it's eye and looks at Hanks and when he eats a live fish . Yuck ! But the ending to the film is awful . Suddenly cutting to ' 4 years later ' when Hanks was on the island is bad enough . But when the movie goes from a ship rescuing him to ' 4 weeks later ' is goes from bad to worse . The events of him being rescued and coming back to civilization and being rehabilitated and repaired are just skipped . He goes from being a cave man to civilised in an obscenely short space of time . For a man who was alone on an island for 4 years ( unless Wilson counts ) he sure does adjust back to normal very quickly . And Zemeckis simply doesn't know how to end the film . We are forced to sit thru scene after scene of Hanks long after the island is gone . The wrap-up of his affair with Helen Hunt is lame and we don't even get to see the reaction of the woman , who's package he was determined to deliver for 4 years , when she opens her FedEx box up . Instead we have Hanks in a ' where do I go now ' debate . It is such a disappointing ending that lets the whole film down . It could have been so much better . I give this because it should have been made in widescreen and should have had a MUCH better ending .
564494	102816	401233	6.0	Clichéd , slow and melodramatic , but worth it when it gets going	Appleseed simultaneously suffers from the worst Anime has to offer and benefits from the best animation and production a modern production can have . If you are a hardcore Manga fan ( or just occasionally fond of it like me ) you'll be aware of the most typical clichés , most of which make up the bulk of the Appleseed story . So . . . we have a world set after WWIII , in which a Utopian Society has finally found peace . But there are still some people who cannot help but let their anger and bigotry take hold . Android / Clones with suppressed emotions help balance out Utopia and some even want to be fully-fledged humans . There are humans who hate these Androids and wish them to all die out . And there are some Android who hate humans and wish them to all die out . And finally , there is a big computer who runs everything . Nothing there you haven't seen before huh ? It also takes a while to build up momentum . Though when it does , the plot twists and turns and action scenes are truly exhilarating . The animation quality is breath-taking with seamless blending of hand-drawn , motion capture , CGI and 3D images . Style and plot-wise it is very , very similar to Sky Blue / Wonderful Days . But since they were in production at the same time one cannot accuse the other of plagiarism . The sheer amount of technology and hardware in the movie will make you drool . There are loads of cool devices , futuristic inventions and awesome weaponry . There is also loads of atmosphere with gorgeous , gorgeous sunsets , storm-lashed oil rigs and wonderfully blue-sky-ed cityscapes with an environmentally friendly amount of trees everywhere . The Matrix ' inspired ' action can be a bit annoying sometimes . We've seen people diving through the air in slow motion will taking out supposedly highly-trained soldiers ? And the music is kinda uninspiring . With contributions from Basement Jaxx and Paul Oakenfold one expected it to be a lot better . When you take the good with the bad , Appleseed still comes out as worthwhile and enjoyable . If your new to Anime then you can forgive the clichés , if your a big fan then you'll be awe-struck by the impressive production values .
564183	102816	27961	6.0	Pluto's Pal	The King of Siam ( or something ) sends Mickey little Bobo , a baby elephant , for a new pet ( he could have phoned ahead ) and a pal for Pluto . So Mickey get down to hard work building an Elephant kennel . Pluto's lil ' Devil on his shoulder ( er . . . where did the angel go ? ) tells him that the elephant is his replacement and to plot against him . Obviously Pluto cannot reads the innocence and friendliness in Bobo's eyes and relentlessly tries to run Bobo off . He just won't give in to his devil's side . Would this be allowed in the disgustingly PC world of Disney today . NO ! A mildly amusing cartoon .
563807	102816	106429	6.0	Better than average TV fare	Most TV movies I've seen are abysmal . But this one manages to rise above than with some okay photography and a really cool musical score by David Michael Frank ( whatever became of him ? ) . Jeff Fahey is quite good at playing Frank , a crooked cop who is hiding out from the bad guys who blinded him in Mexico . There he meets Mia Sara who plays Chandler Strange and he becomes involved in a schemey sub-plot . Things turn against him as events arise suspicion . This TV movie has it's roots in low-key gangster movies and sticks to them like glue . By doing this the whole movie feels authentic and atmospheric . Which is not something you see all the time in TV movies . Overall
564409	102816	59800	6.0	Not much going on here .	Thunderball may have nice locations and pretty seaside scenery but there's a shocking lack in set pieces or excitement . The evil SPECTRE organisation nicks a warplane and lands it in the ocean . Within minutes they've spirited away the nuclear warheads and are demanding a ransom or they'll blow up a major city . Sounds like Broken Arrow huh ? Well the British Government are none too happy about this so they send - 007 after them . Bond has been ' relaxing ' at some sort of health farm where the culprits just so happened to be doing evil deeds so he's already way ahead of the game . Off he goes to the Bahamas ( how come super-villains never have lairs in Liverpool or Coventry ? ) to track the missing plane down and , with any luck , get the warheads back . But not before he scuba dives about a zillion times , goes to the casino and shags loads of women . Isn't he on a time limit here ? His gadgets are not THAT fancy , the action not THAT impressive but maybe I'm guilty of double standards here . I've always thought that the latest Bond movies were guilty of being nothing but spectacle and loads of SFX . They don't feel real and are increasingly being pushed into sci-fi rather than super-spy . Sp if you've had enough of the xXx style Die Another Day , something Thunderball will balance it out . But there are better Bonds than this , though it does have some nice widescreen photography and the constant sunny seaside locations will make you want to go on holiday immediately .
564199	102816	1110280	6.0	Fun , but repetitive and lacking in thrills	As much as I enjoyed Super Paper Mario , I just wasn't impressed by any part of it . It's a cute Mario game ( as they all are ) but I never felt like I was really playing an RPG and the endless dialogue bubbles really slow the game down . The levels are colorful and bright and look absolutely gorgeous . The music is pleasant enough but the trademark Mario theme barely gets a mention . As for the gameplay , well . . . it's standard Mario platform stuff with the new addition of flipping to 3D and some unique abilities with the Wii controller . It's nothing to write home about . For 20 hours I stuck with this game and by the bitter end I felt like I could have used that time to do something better . Honestly nothing in this game impresses and if I didn't have a photographic memory I'd be completely forgetting about it in a week . If that makes any sense . So . . . very . . . very . . . slow . I don't like video games like this . If I wanted to read a book I'd read one . In the end , it's the endless dialogue that cripples SPM . Pros : Very nice graphics . Incredibly cute . Easy to control . Giant Mario from NSMB returns ( though it's equally as brief and pointless ) Cons : Cut-scenes take FOREVER ! Way , way , waaaaaaay too much dialogue . Flipside missions are very boring . Gets tedious and repetitive about halfway through .
563912	102816	97733	7.0	They're back , they're bad . He's black , he's mad .	The topical plot of Lethal Weapon 2 may seem a little dated now , but Soud Av-ree-gan villains are always despicable and who doesn't love to them get blown away . In this second installment in the LW series , Riggs and Murtaugh babysit FBI witness Leo Getz ( a wimpy , eager to be friends Joe Pesci ) , much to their displeasure . Stuck with nothing much to do , they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want . Riggs also takes a fancy to their secretary Rika ( Patsy Kensit ) , but obviously their romance isn't going to last . She might as well have a death-clock counting down on her forehead . Richard Donner seems more involved in making LW2 a better film than the original . This time he shoots in Panavision ( why he didn't do this first time around I don't know ) , allows more time for character development and tries hard to make a political message out of the South African Apartheid situation . Even in his previous film Scrooged , which came out a year earlier , he had anti-apartheid messages . And , if you're really sad like me , you'll notice that Riggs and Rika bang their heads together when they first meet in the exact same way that Frank Cross and Claire Phillips do in Scrooged . And his then pro-NRA posters are still hanging around in the background . Donner later reversed his opinion on this organisation . I always felt that the original Lethal Weapon was far too plain and straight-forward . It lacked spark in every way , but LW2 introduces more characters , has more sophisticated action and a better plot . Michael Kamen however pretty much cuts and pastes his score from the first and even rips-off his own Die Hard score in a couple of cues . This got worse in LW3 . The ending could have killed the series off had Riggs died , which is what Shane Black originally intended . We would have been spared the awful LW3 had this been so . But instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times . A nice touch having Bob Dylan's " Knockin ' On Heaven's Door " playing over his potential last moments alive though . After this the series became too comical and diluted . They SHOULD have killed him .
564218	102816	61044	7.0	Is it a bird ? Is it a plane ?	No , it's a large , anthropomorphic pink cat . The Pink Panther is sitting in hammock reading a super-hero comic-book and wishes to be one himself . He nicks a pink cape from a nearby washing-line ands sets about rescuing and helping people in need . Only he's really , really bad at it and would be better off not interfering with them at all as pain and suffering are about the only things he's good for . Some of the visual gags are funny and each bad situation as a fair amount of invention to it . It adds up to an above average cartoon and no matter what he does , Pinky is my hero .
564253	102816	63456	7.0	Poor guy	Poor Anthony Perkins . He played one psycho and then another within a few years of each other and the guy got typecast for the rest of his career . I must say that Pretty Poison's Dennis Pitt is to Psycho's Norman Bates what a firecracker is to the big bang . Orphan Pitt is fresh out of jail after spending some time inside for burning down his aunt's house when he was a kid . Unfortunately for him ( and her ) she was inside the house when it went up . It was only an accident but his weird personality is what really damns him . He fancies himself as a bit of a Billy Liar . His life is boring and uneventful out of jail so he concocts elaborate fantasies to keep himself going and to make people interested in him . With the exception of his concerned parole officer , it works mostly for people who come and go . That is until he meets pretty high school senior Sue Ann Stepanek and goes a bit too far with his fibbing . This time he says he's in the CIA and his mission is to stop a local factory from polluting a river . It's a noble plan but once he involves Sue Ann she becomes homicidal and takes too much pleasure in offing a security guard . Obviously freaked out by the turn of events Pitt is unsure what to do , especially since Sue Ann has just declared her undying love for him . Any sensible guy would head for the hills but Dennis is just a bit too naive . You'll definitely feel sorry for the guy . He even gets roped into helping the increasingly mad Sue Ann carry out even more dirty deeds . It's obvious that the film isn't headed for a happy ending and it's not even an easy watch getting there . Perkins is brilliant as Dennis Pitt and you'll be on his side the whole time and really feeling for him and his huge innocent eyes and nervous twitches and ticks that become more and more obvious . His only real crime is falling for the wrong girl . Once again , it's his weird personality that ends up damning him . If you're a guy the lesson is don't fall in love with wrong girl no matter how pretty she is . It's the pretty ones that end up being the most poisonous . Trust me , The Gator knows . If you're a girl the lesson is don't be a bitch . Pretty much all guys are innocent until a woman comes along and screws them up . Prove me wrong kiddies . Prove me wrong .
563792	102816	41450	7.0	Just for the Hell of it	Tom chases Jerry for no particular reason , and the cartoon seems to be giving us the usual fare until Jerry flattens Tom with a piano , killing him . A quick ride to heaven on an escalator brings him to the pearly gates , where some kind of train conduction is a cat version of Saint Peter . The Heavenly Express leaves in an hour and if Tom can get a signed document of forgiveness from Jerry he's free to enter . If not-HELL ! Now it's Tom's chance to be as nice to Jerry as possible , but he's having none of it and refuses to sign , sealing the cat's fate forever . It's a funny cartoon , with some nice moments . Though I was a little surprised to see the three dead kittens drowned in a bag at the gates of heaven .
564200	102816	804555	7.0	A surprisingly good movie .	Low-rent slasher sequels are usually garbage , I mean has anyone seen Hostel 2 , The Grudge 2 or Hills Have Eyes 2 ? As a result I really wasn't expecting much of this movie despite enjoying the first , not merely for the gorgeous Eliza Dushku either . The premise is nothing new , but the characters , gore and inventive kills make it well worth watching . The always cool Henry Rollins ( who I'd pay money just to see reading the bible ) plays a retired Army Colonel who is now hosting a faux-post apocalyptic reality game show . The setting : the woods . But not just any woods , this is inbred hillbilly territory and they are only too happy to devour a bunch of young city folks . Erica Leerhseen ( who seriously does not look as old as she is ) plays Nina , the cynical , jaded one of the group who keeps her cool when the guts start spilling . Usually with these movies you can tell exactly who is going to die and in what order , but Wrong Turn 2 still managed to seem fresh . I wasn't simply waiting for characters to die or wishing that they'd hurry up and meet a grisly end , since such fodder are usually highly annoying . The one thing that I didn't like was the utterly flat photography . The original had a dark , grainy and hardcore look to it but the sequel just seems so clean and bright and open . I think that if Joe Lynch was perhaps a more experienced director then the film would look tighter and more dynamic , as it is the cinematography does little to compliment the above-average production design . If you are a fan of the first movie then I totally recommend that you give this one a go . It surpassed my expectations and I'm usually quite a snob when it comes to movies .
563879	102816	41391	7.0	Cutesy penguin	Not the Danny DeVito penguin I assure you . Bugs is on his way to Miami beach but , like usual , he cannot read a map to save his life ( it must be kinda tough to do underground I guess ) and ends up in the South Pole . After inadvertently saving the life of a cute little penguin from an Eskimo hunter ( in the south pole ? ) the penguin becomes too attached to Bugs to let him leave . Though Bugs cannot bear to look into the Penguin's sad little eyes he shoves him away to get back to his vacation to Miami . Only the little Penguin falls right into the hands of the hunter again and Bugs must use his old tricks of outsmarting and extreme cunning to save his life again . Funny ? Yes . Cute ? Yes . But still not as many laughs as you're used to getting from Bugs .
564824	102816	113568	7.0	What the hell is going on ? ? ?	Is a question I asked myself many times thru-out this movie . The plot lost me somewhere along the line when they mention a guy called the puppet-master . After that I hadn't a clue what to make of it . But that doesn't mean the film doesn't have some cool set pieces or that it's not worth watching . There is a cool moment when the girl is fighting a spider-like tank in an old deserted building . The music and the atmosphere of that scene is way cool and gunfire looks and sounds awesome . But there are some bad scenes too . Like the one where a character is wandering thru a street market and the music is made up of psalm singing . Ugh ! That scene is awful and I have no idea why the director allowed it to be in the movie . There is another scene which is also a direct rip-off of Predator with an invisible camouflaged villain being chased by an Arnie-like good guy hero . But although it was a rip-off it was still enjoyable . Only Manga fans and those who like to be REALLY involved with a movie should watch this . For all others it is just way too confusing and has too much influence from another culture . But anyways .
564331	102816	1097636	7.0	Stay Cool , Scooby-Doo !	Shaggy and Scooby get on the wrong plane when en route to meet the rest of the Mystery Inc . gang in Paris and end up lost in the Himalayas while an abdominal snowman is on the loose . There is the usual amount of suspects and motives but it's just fresh enough to prevent the plot from becoming tiresome . The animation just gets better and better with each entry in the Scooby-Doo series and the bright colors and active sound design are a long way from the grainy TV show back in 1969 ( though that still has its charm ) . Fans of the series will be glad to hear that the character of Dell Chillman from the Loch Ness adventure returns for this one , giving some continuity to the otherwise unrelated mysteries . I must admit that I preferred it when the monsters ended up being real but I guess that each mystery has its own logic and you'll be surprised at who is behind the mask of the adorable snowman . Keep ' em coming , Warner . That ol ' Great Dane could live to a hundred .
563881	102816	209163	7.0	A fast-paced , inventive adventure	Mummy Returns takes the characters and story from the first film and develops on them in a big , big way . The situations and set-pieces are wilder , the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex . Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids . Who could have predicted that their old nemesis I'm-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before . But I'm still having trouble seeing I'm-Ho-Tep as a villain . Surely it's the scheming , lying , conspiring supplicants that are the real villains . The look in his eyes at the end , when his lover betrays him , is heartbreaking . I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad . Sure he wants to rule the world and all but who doesn't ? The effects are not the best ( Star Wars Episode 2 used up all the space at ILM at the time ) but there are loads of them and they're all lavish and imaginative . I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way . How cool is the big balloon ? Or the approach of Anubis ' army ? Most directors screw-up big budget , big scale movies ( AVP , King Arthur , Sky Captain , Exorcist Prequel , Catwoman ) but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers , once again , a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up . Filmed in Panavision the 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture is perfect and the Dolby / DTS 5 . 1 is very loud and thundering . A very good soundtrack indeed . The extras are total fluff and not worth the time .
564799	102816	102266	7.0	Should have been a franchise	Back in 1991 there was still only one way that studios could sell Bruce Willis and that was as various incarnations of his Die Hard hero . Even Eddie ( Hudson ) Hawkins had similarities to John McClane . Joe Hallenback is a sort of mix between McClane and Snake Plissken . Watching him mumble and grunt thru various near-deaths and close shaves makes for much fun . Hallenback is a P . I . and scrounges for work wherever he can find it . So he takes up a job protecting a stripper named Cory and soon finds himself in a lot of trouble . Bad guys are trying to get him left right and centre and his bratty 13-year-old daughter tagging along doesn't help much . The bad guys are truly evil and Hallenback seems more like an anti-hero . This adds to the rough nature of the movie and heightens the sense of adventure . Tony Scott's style of direction is best suited to this type of action flick . The flashy , exotic editing and cinematographic techniques lend a lot to the witty script and compliment the seedy or pretty locations . Shane Black has also written dozens of one-liners and riddled the script with funny dialogue and exciting situations . It's no surprise that this was once the most expensive script ever sold in Hollywood . Some people say that this film is too violent and misogynist but I honestly cannot understand what they are talking about . I guess it was just a little out of the norm back in 1991 . But still the tone of the film is so light and enjoyable you begin to wonder how this never made up for it . Check it out for yourself and I am sure that you will enjoy . Love that opening song , man .
564878	102816	46811	7.0	Very Bunny	I was never too interested in the character of Rocky , he always seemed too one-dimensional and monotone . Of course this is intentional but I could never excited when a Rocky and Bugs cartoon came on . He was however great in Daffy's Golden Yeggs . This time around Bugs is taking it easy in the city as Rabbit Season ( DUCK SEASON ! ) is kicking off in the country . He hails a taxi to go for a cruise but ends up in the backseat of Rocky's getaway car . Seconds later , Rocky has robbed a bank and is using Bugs as a hostage . Bugs a hostage ? Puh-lease ! He's got more wits and cunning in his baby finger than both Rocky and Mugsy together . Very clever hijinks follow with a very funny ending .
563839	102816	280938	7.0	Metal Slug 2 Redux	Those of you thinking that Metal Slug X is a brand new game are mistaken , I am afraid to say . It's actually just a little bit bigger and a little bit better version of Metal Slug 2 . It was a fine game on it's own , but now you have some slightly altered enemies and new graphics here and there . It's not a major improvement and almost doesn't justify it's reason to exist . But since I got it included in my Metal Slug Anthology for the Nintendo Wii it's not like I went out of my way to pay extra for it . It's inclusion in this particular package is a mystery since one cannot possible feel the need to play it immediately after Metal Slug 2 . SNK should have replaced with Metal Slug Advance at the very least . A fun shooter nonetheless .
564469	102816	163862	7.0	Short , but entertaining	From the bulk of reviews on this site I gather most people don't realize that IMAX is about presentation and style rather than story and content . Shot on vertical 70mm film the reels in the projection booth take up a huge amount of space , thus the running time of IMAX movies tends to be kept to around 45-50 minutes . Thus the format lends itself more towards the documentary / short movie genre . Most of the movies are factual but sometimes original stories come along . T-Rex : Back to the Cretaceous is one of them . It came out in 1998 and when I was at the Trocadero IMAX-3D cinema in London I had to choose between this movie and another called Across the Sea of Time . I chose the latter . Which is a shame coz the dinosaurs and huge shots of this movie would have looked better in 3D . T-Rex begins with an impressive opening shot of the camera swooping over the Arizona desert , which still looks great even on a widescreen TV instead of the huge IMAX screen . There's a hefty narration from the lead actress conveying relevant information about dinosaurs . In this respect the film feels a bit like a 10-year-old's educational program . But being familiar with IMAX movies I was expecting this . I think too many people were expecting a Jurassic Park variant . Tho I would have expected a few more dinosaurs . In the 45 minute running time there wasn't much dinosaur action . Though there was a good amount of story that I did get into . Plus the movie has a great score by William Ross . He released a promo CD of this score but it's impossible to find . Hey , I was entertained and I thot the brief story was quite okay . The horribly slanderous reviews on this site really baffle me . The IMAX format does not work well on DVD , you have to see these movies in the cinema . But if you have a good sound system then the DVD is still worth it . The DVD is in 1 . 33 : 1 full frame ( they are shown theatrically at 1 . 44 : 1 so there isn't much modification to the framing ) with a Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack that is quite impressive . A slight featurette and an IMAX movies trailer are also included .
564031	102816	31448	7.0	Too short and slightly contracted but still worthwhile	Libraries and bookstores often put Hound of the Baskervilles in the horror section , well I never thought of the book to be exactly that . As Sherlock Holmes mysteries go , it was a long if nothing truly outstanding . There have been many movie interpretations over the years including Hammer horror versions , spoofs and multiple TV movies . There was even a silent version before this one , if my memory serves me correctly . So I guess it's one of the more famous of the original stories . Produced by 20th Century Fox , this was the first of 14 Holmes adventures to star Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ( descendant of ' Robert The ' ) as Holmes and Watson . It stays fairly faithful to the book but misses out some of the meatier parts . Barrymore and his wife ( here called Barryman instead ) are no longer secretly brother and sister and the presence of the hound isn't as oppressive as it seemed in the novel . And it's obvious that the movie is clearly not really shot on Dartmoor but on a sound-stage in California . But it's none the worse for that . The studio setting actually lends a unique atmosphere to the gloomy Grimpen Mire and I especially like the dark and shadowy Baskerville Hall . I just wish more happened in and around it . The chemistry between Rathbone and Bruce here already seems to be perfect . Watson and Holmes have an original friendship and , as actors , they take advantage of that to accentuate their performances . I am aware that all Holmes / Watson combination of actors have done this over the years , but not as frequently as these two . A good timekiller , I just wish they made it longer .
564792	102816	144084	7.0	This is a COMEDY !	When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it . But I watched it with the wrong attitude . I was judging American Psycho as a horror film . Which it certainly is NOT . It's about ( as the film constantly says ) a complete [ loser ] . He's no friends . Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial , yuppie colleagues ( some of which don't even know his name ) , takes far , far too much pride in his appearance and has way , way to much love for his material possessions . He is Patrick Bateman . And fitting in / looking normal / being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life . But murder , misogyny , degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for . It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so . American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch . You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers . How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling , flexing his muscles , while having sex with a call girl ? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously ? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious . Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable . Come on ! Cliff Huxtable ? ? ? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy ? Don't watch this as a horror film . It's a comic , drama-tragedy . Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen . And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight . Though his world of slick , cocaine-snorting , superficial , Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to . Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals . The DVD has a great looking 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture and a loud , well produced Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack . The extras ( apart from the deleted scenes ) , unfortunately , are pathetic . e movie with a scene of Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine ) that the point of the satire is nearly lost : Without the fickle trends of society , Bateman is an empty shell . Save his greed and bloodlust , he is a robot . Harron tones down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome ; the scene where Bateman , nude and bloody , chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the " Me Decade " with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film . Despite a lame " Is Patrick really nutso ? " twist that hurts the movie , the point is not lost here , and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on her hands . Bale shines as Bateman , making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to . Whether he's stiff , menacing , dryly sarcastic , tortured or over the edge psychotic , Bale is mesmerizing . If there's any justice in the world , Patrick Bateman will be a career maker . Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well . With the exception of Matt Ross , who steals his scenes as a homosexual co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation , all other actors are window dressing . Witherspoon's role is written so blandly anybody could have played it , while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her characer moons over Patrick . Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective investigating one of Bateman's crimes , but . . . this is Bale's movie . It's a wild ride that gets a little hazy in parts , but is certainly enjoyable in most places .
564575	102816	59721	7.0	Why can't men be more like Animals ?	A bit more like Looney Tunes than usual for old Pinky here . But that's to be expected when most of the Pink Panther cartoons are from Freleng and Depatie . This time round a Texan Big Game hunter is rounding up animals for his ' ark ' so he can just go about shooting fish in a barrel . Kind of takes the sport out of it but . . . hey ho . The last on his list is a Pink Panther and he goes after our favorite cat like Wile E . Coyote would go after the Roadrunner . Of course Pinky outsmarts him at every turn , even causes him to go plummeting from cliffs Coyote style . And in the end , of course , he wins and talks for one of those very few times . I love the Pink Panther .
564388	102816	40661	7.0	No new cats !	Jerry is tormenting Mammy-Two-Shoes ( dubbed to sound less ' offensive ' in the version that I watched and I suspect they have rewritten some of her dialogue too ) but Tom is too slow and too lazy to catch him . Annoyed with this , she introduces a new orange cat called Lightning and kicks Tom out of the house , along with Jerry , for good . But Lightning turns out to be a glutton and T & J reckon it's time they teamed up and hatch a plan to give Lightning what he deserves ( IE a painful walloping and framing him ) . Some good gags and visual humor along with a more original plot make this a better than average T & J short .
564032	102816	118928	7.0	Enjoy the fireworks .	The ' old-fashioned ' disaster movie scenario enjoyed a brief resurgence in the latter half of the 90s . After the success of Twister and ID4 , films like Hard Rain , Titanic , Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake . Like the two competing asteroid movies , Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997 . Which one is better ? Well , comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple . Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton , a Vulcanologist ( or James Bond in disguise if you want ) who predicts a major eruption in the quaint Pacific-Northwestern town of Dante's Peak . No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy . It's the politics from Jaws all over again . Despite being shouted down by his superiors , Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando ( Linda Hamilton ) , who is the only one who believes the 4000-year dormant volcano might blow its top . If you've seen one disaster movie , you've seen ' em all in terms of character importance . Yes , it's bloody obvious who is going to die , some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads . And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey . When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way ? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak , it never really distances itself from that single , eternal cliché of disaster films . But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well . Made before the extreme popularity of CGI , Dante's Peak has a lot of real-life destruction , in-camera effects and stunt-work . Yes , there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10-year-old film they still hold up really well . All Volano ( Zzzz . . . ) had to offer was a very , very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes , boiled skinny dippers , lakes of acid , ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere , thunder and lightning , red hot boulders raining down from the sky , mudslides , lava ( of course ) , a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep , deep bass sound effects . It's not a life-changing film by any means , but as disaster movies go it's one of the best , has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously . I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog ( more original ) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character .
563907	102816	958860	7.0	Seventy grand , I want it back .	Before studio execs and Mel Gibson got all uppity with Brian Helgeland , Payback was a darker , meaner film . But after an apparently poor test screening in 1997 ( honestly , what IS the point of these ? ) they put Payback on hold for over a year so Mel could do Lethal Weapon 4 before going back for some re-shoots , with a new director , to make the film happier . So they approved a script of a dark , moody revenge thriller , green-lighted it for production and changed their minds to make it lighter because a ragtag audience didn't understand / like it ? Man , Hollywood is one weird town . The resulting film , which was eventually released in 1999 , seemed a bit tacked together . There were scenes that just seemed out of place and irregular . It was obvious that any scene actually shot back in 1997 was shot on location and any scene shot for the 1999 cut was just shot in the generic ' street set ' on the Warner back-lot . Despite all of this , Payback was still a fun film that failed to go all the way with it's concept . The new DC is a superior version , no doubt and is about 33 % different . There are new scenes and odds and ends through out the running time and the last act is completely different . Kris Kristoffersen is gone and replaced by Sally Kellerman ( voice only , Bronson is never seen ) . James Coburn and John Glover also have smaller roles . The narration from Porter is gone as well as the blue tint to most of the film . Now most scenes are just lit as normal without any post-production filtering . There is also a new musical score . The jazzy feel to the opening scenes is still there but through-out the rest of the film the score is more atmospheric and understated . Both are as good as each and fit the differing tones , so there's no better of the two . It does end a bit abruptly and without any truly satisfying conclusion . I guess this is what annoyed test audiences . But a disgruntled audience should not be a decision-making committee when it comes to making movies .

564453	102816	263941	7.0	Needs an update .	This is a real awesome game with great playability and is well worth a look . My only problem is with the graphics . They are so out of date that they ruin the game big time . Everything is fine when you are n your bike going real fast but as soon as you fall off the bike and walk slowly you realize all the houses , trees and even cars are so badly animated and pixalized . 1960's video games look better than this . If there were any back then . Electronic Arts should definitely re-issue this game with better graphics , sound and more adventurous courses . When you crash on the Pacific Highway course and fall off the cliff . . . man . . . talk about bad programming .
564536	102816	118583	8.0	A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT	This movie rocks . It looks and feels more futuristic than the first 3 and for once the characters weren't boring , annoying or blank . The space pirates , the mad doctors , the marines and the new , very sexy and very seductive Ripley are very appealing . The mad doctors wanted to bring Ripley back because of the Queen that was inside her . So she is cloned , but only the eighth copy ? works . All of the others crashed , like computers , and look way gross . She has partial memories of her past , has superhuman strength , has acid for blood ( cool ) and is connected to the creatures in a weird way . The mad doctors want more hosts for the aliens so they can breed them and train them for Biological Warfare . The space pirates bring a cargo full of frozen prisoners to them for that reason and bring with them Call , an android , who takes a large interest in Ripley . It was inevitable that the aliens would break loose and when they do , all hell breaks loose . This time round the Aliens seem cooler and smarter , unlike in Aliens when they were just there as a reason for gunfire , they can talk to each other and can figure out how doors and buttons work . Although they are mostly CGI , they still look scary and the swimming sequence in the flooded dinnerhall is cool to the max . Many critics disliked the ending immensely , but I think that the beautiful sunset over earth infinitely better than the ending in Alien 3 . The " Newborn " Alien is gross , creepy and way disturbing . I have no doubt that you will feel the same and the " death by suction " is sickening . I hope that there is another Alien movie that is as cool as this one . But it seems that the odd numbered Alien movies are crap and the even good . Or am I just talking nonsense ?
564719	102816	118571	8.0	Brilliantly done action	It's easy to understand why Airforce One was such a big hit . The President saves the country . America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from those no good filthy Reds again . Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts ( fuelled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score ) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President . But the film is very good in it's own right too . Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension , Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary . The film is also very well put together technically . The editing and sound is top-notch . But there are flaws . And one BIG flaw . Some of the dialogue really sucks . And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady . The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady . Her role is totally useless . I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it . I am not kidding . Even Oldman at one point tells her to ' SHUT UP ! ' I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have . If you can overlook this minor , although highly irritating , glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many , increasingly exciting , set-pieces . Very cool .
564438	102816	39017	8.0	The Whisky Train	Holmes has been hired to protect a man carrying a priceless gem as he travels from London to Edinburgh by night train . A sinister and suspicious lot of passengers surround them in their carriage and before long the man is dead and the gem stolen . With Lestrade ( who just happens to be there ) and Watson ( who almost misses the train ) to ' help ' , Holmes views each and every passenger with suspicion as the Scotch Express ( the what ? ) rockets through the dark countryside . There's plenty of atmosphere and even a little bit of claustrophobia but director Roy William Neil makes full use of his literal train set and isolated setting . It may be a bit too short , but it's certainly one of the best Rathbone / Bruce movies .
563852	102816	260264	8.0	Junkie ?	Is it just me or is Pac-Man a metaphor for taking too many ecstasy pills ? Think about it , you've got some happy little face stumbling around in the dark munching as many pills as he can get but when things go bad he's chased by ghosts all over the place until he can get more pills . Either this is really subliminal subtext by designer Toru Iwatani or it's just an amazing coincidence and I'm reading far too much into it . Either way Pac-Man is like THE biggest ever arcade game , which is quite amazing since many more advanced and technologically superior games came out after this . And it has one funky little theme tune !
564158	102816	342172	8.0	We'll never know the truth !	Because there is no evidence to prove either way . The fact that 2 long prison sentences were still the result of all this is shocking . If I were innocent of a crime I did not commit ( especially one as horrible as this ) , I would NEVER give in and plead guilty just to bargain with the judge . I have no respect for Jesse Friedman in this regard . Let me make it clearer . Andrew Jarecki was just making a documentary about New York Clowns when he met David Friedman , the best party clown in New York . David told him of his past and provided Jarecki with hundreds of reels of family home-movie footage . The Friedmans captured every moment of their lives on film it would seem . The story that unfolded in these films was something Jarecki could never even dream of . Arnold Friedman was a troubled man . After the death of his 9-year-old big sister his father left and the family was torn apart . His mother moved into a tiny apartment with him and his brother and all three of them shared a room . The mother would bring back male partners and shag them in full view / earshot of her sons . Wouldn't that disturb you ? But it gets even worse . He was a merry man , slightly camp and married a woman who was as about as sexually responsive to him as a blow-up doll . They may have had three sons and lived a ' happy ' existence as an upper-middle class Jewish family in a well-to-do part of the state , but underneath it all Arnold was hiding a secret . He was a huge paedophile and he liked really young boys . He would order kiddie fiddling mags from Europe , but one of them was seized by customs and he was investigated . Arnold also taught computer class and the cops made a list of all the names of the kids he taught and made a point of interviewing them with some truly dodgy , unclear , unprofessional techniques . Many of the kids said that Arnold and his oldest son Jesse had been sexually abusing them . And not a simple one-at-a-time deal either . Apparently they had made them all strip naked in class and play a horrible game called ' leap frog ' in which each and everyone of them would quickly and systematically be anally raped . Is this disgusting ? Of course it is ? Do I believe it ? No ! There is no way that this could have continued for as long as it did without someone noticing . Other kids in the same class said nothing like it ever occurred . And if it did then where is the evidence ? Without meaning to sound crude , anal sex is a pretty difficult thing to get right as an adult . For terrified , unwilling children who are being mass-raped where was the tissue damage , the blood , the tears , the agony and the reluctance to ever go back to Mr Friedman's class ? Even for adults it's not simply like sticking a hot dog through a donut . This whole allegation that they did anal-rape as a game of leap frog is absurd and totally far-fetched . Did Arnold Friedman have wicked thoughts about his students ? Probably . Did he involve his then 18-year-old son ? Hmmm , I'm not sure about that one . Let me just say that the Friedman household is one I am glad I am not part of . There always seems to be an atmosphere of unnaturalness or ' something ain't quite right here ' about it . Jesse Friedman says that his dad never hurt him . Jesse Friedman's Defence Attoney says otherwise . This is a particular trick Jarecki uses to show the conflicting sides of the story . One person says black and immediately another person says white . The documentary is nothing but contradicting stories and polar opposites . While I do not believe the entire innocence of Arnold Friedman ( the man clearly WAS a paedophile ) , I do NOT believe the word of the Cops , the FBI or any other authority interviewed . The Judge , one Abbey Boklan , said she was sure of Arnold Friedman's guilt the second she saw him . In my view , she's openly admitting to Gross Professional Misconuct . How dare she , a judge , a stern , responsible authority figure , make such an outrageous , unfounded remark without hearing ANY kind of evidence first . And like I said , there IS no evidence . Only the claims of the children . Nothing in this case was based on evidence because evidence didn't exist . Doesn't that strike you as being really , really odd ? The Cops claimed that hypnosis was used to get answers out of the kids . As well as pressure from the parents ( oblivious to the fact that their kids are undamaged physically ) to tell the proverbial awful truth and encouraging embellishment of perhaps slight truths and instances to the point where this whole ridiculous leap frog game is created . The trial is not the only focus of the film . The complete and utter breakdown of the family is also caught on camera . The sons hate their mother with a passion at her refusal to stand by her man . I can understand their anger , but what woman would ? She had no evidence to persuade her either way , but she always found an unnaturalness to Arnold and the allegations probably confirmed her fears I guess . Arnold killed himself in prison in 1995 so Jesse , also imprisoned for 13 years despite no evidence , could benefit from the $250 , 000 insurance policy . Mrs Friedman re-married but the family name is stained forever in my opinion . So too should be the word of all the unprofessional authorities and lawyers involved . No one in this documentary comes away without tarnish . It's a sick , sad and sorry story that will confuse as much as it enlightens . Make up your own mind .
564421	102816	120696	8.0	Great action movie	This movie worked best in the cinema . It's too bad it flopped because the big screen is where it deserved to be seen . Too many folks have seen and criticised this film from TV viewings that do the scope of the action no justice whatsoever . The action scenes are incredible and this movie is very well made . The bouncing , shaking , wobbling camera was an innovative idea and if you like the slow-motion fire-fights of John Woo movies but hate the gun pornography of trash like Bad Boys II then you'll get a kick out of Hard Rain . And the music was just totally awesome too . Chris Young's score is the orchestral sound of violence , mayhem and nature taking over . Seriously , it's great stuff and you really ought to get the score CD . Christian Slater also makes for a better action hero in this than he did in hard rain . Randy Quaid and Morgan Freeman were very good too but I don't think Minnie Driver did a convincing American accent . Don't be to hard on this film . It isn't supposed to be Citizen Kane . It's a pure action film with the minimal of plot to get in the way . It was originally called The Flood and had numerous other characters in it and had many daylight scenes . But because of an abundance of disaster movies at the time it was re-shot as an action movie that was set totally at night . And practically in real time too . Sadly the Region 1 DVD is in Dolby 5 . 1 and is letterboxed at 2 . 30 : 1 . It's not the best DVD of the film . If you have a multi-regional player then I suggest that you get the Korean Region 3 box set with a beautiful anamorphic transfer , DTS 5 . 1 and the script book included .
563836	102816	37794	8.0	The Great House Detective	After a double homicide involving a gentleman's club , Holmes and Watson are dispatched to a spooky castle on the west coast of Scotland to investigate . It appears that the victims were delivered five orange pips while at dinner with the rest of them before they met their untimely deaths . Already disbelieving the story , Holmes is viewing them all with suspicion as soon as he arrives . Like a typical Friday the 13th film , the bodies start piling up in increasing gruesome fashion and the culprit is narrowed down . But Holmes still ain't convinced and secretly builds his own theories and tactics . Again , House of Fear has the best kind of mystery atmosphere . I love the dark and spooky Scottish castle with the ever-howling wind and labyrinthine structure . I'd love to own a house like that . Watson comes across as a bit more buffoonish than usual but he still entertains . And despite reading the Adventure of the Five Orange Pips a few years ago I was still surprised by the twist ending . One of the best Rathbone / Bruce movies .
564716	102816	310775	8.0	Grips you like a vice . Hits you like a ton of bricks .	Before you watch this film , just be aware that you're not going to walk away from it with a big smile on your face . More like you'll want to slit your wrists . To say that Mr . Vengeance is a powerful , gut-wrenching nightmare is like saying that DaVinci merely dabbled in art . The plot is so simple yet so complex . The direction is so elegant yet so hard-hitting . The simplistic nature of the story makes the descent into hell so shocking and captivating . You don't realize there is no going back until it's far , FAR too late . Ryu is a deaf / mute who works in the loudest factory in the world , doing a really depressing job . His sister needs a kidney transplant , but they don't have the money to pay for it . He cannot give her one of his own because their blood types do not match . Ryu decides to go to black market organ traders to trade one of his own for one that matches his sister . Waking up naked and kidney-less in an abandoned building he now needs to raise money for his own kidney . Ryu is now fired from his job by President Park , who is downsizing the company . His anarchist girlfriend Yeong-mi convinces him to kidnap Park's daughter and hold her to ransom . From then on , things get very , very , VERY heavy and the idea of who exactly Mr . Vengeance is is blurred and sympathy is felt for almost everyone . Revenge comes at a high price and seemingly never ends . Not that I am saying forgiving and forgetting is the way . But this movie will make you think twice about getting your own back . The violence is spontaneous and extremely graphic without ever feeling exploitational . Sometimes it has a darkly comic feel to it , the rest of the time it's goddamn hardcore . You'll wince a great deal during this movie , that's for damn sure . Park Chan-wook directs with such beautifully composed images that are far from the the garish MTV-style action / thriller movies produced in Hollywood these days . I don't want to sound like some sort of snob who proclaims all foreign films to be great and all Hollywood to be crap but it's not very often that Hollywood makes a film like this unless it's a remake . Written in a mere 20 hours in a single massive , creative outburst , this movie seems to have genius laced through every minute of it's running time . Not a date movie , not a whogivesadamn pig-out movie . Sympathy for Mr . Vengeance is a film you will be sucked right into and you'll be far from happy when you emerge at the end . But what a horrific ride !
563842	102816	434188	8.0	Ouch !	When asked to name something hard one might suggest Mr . T or the Incredible Hulk . What you don't know is that there is nothing harder on this Earth than the video game Metal Slug . It is honestly one of the most punishing arcade experiences of my life . Obviously it's designed to be this way since it prompts the player to feed more and more coins into the machine . It took me 41 continues to finish the entire game , that would work out at over $10 if I was spending quarters . Why would anyone play such a difficult game ? How about because Metal Slug is bursting at the seams with action and humor . Along with Turrican and Midnight Resistance it's one of the best side-scrolling , run and gun shoot-em-ups ever . Watching things blow up has never been so much fun . But you'll be getting blisters pretty damn fast on the tips of your fingers .
564800	102816	242445	8.0	Seagal proved he still had it , then flunked out again	A lot of you may consider Steven Seagal's non-presence for the past 4 years a blessing ( he last appeared in 1997's Fire Down Below , which was a No . 1 hit but still weak movie ) but I think that audiences are just too dismissive of him and that he needs to be given another chance . They waited for him to slip up and as soon as he delivered a flop We called him names and forgot about him . But now veteran action producer Joel Silver has thrust Steve back in the limelight , put him on the Slimfast diet ( it really , really works ) and given him better material to work with . After all an actor can only do as good as the script . From a novel of the same name by John Westerman ( but bearing about % 40 resemblance to it ) the plot centres on Orin Boyd . A cop busted down to Patrolman after a rough encounter with the Vice-President ( Gore ? Cheney ? ) . Once on the streets Boyd's suspicious nose can't keep him out of trouble with undercover cops who are trying to bust local Drug Boss Latrell Walker ( DMX ) ? or so it seems . Boyd smells foul play and intrudes upon a stakeout , handcuffing TK , one of Walkers men ( Anthony Anderson ) to the front of his car before doing so . When he returns to find the front of his car missing and the thug long gone Boyd takes it upon as his responsibility to get it back and inadvertently expose a ring of corrupt cops in the process . After all his car comes first . There are many attempts at irony throughout the movie and surprisingly enough most of them work . Boyd is forced to attend rage control classes in which he meets eccentric TV host Henry Wayne ( Tom Arnold ) who becomes his wannabe partner . But sadly enough the classes don't work as Boyd continues to uses violence first , ask questions later . And there is a public service announcement too . Seagal survives a car wreck by airbag . A later car crash victim ? doesn't have one and dies ? I think . There are only a couple of ' cop movie ' clichés but not much else . The bad guys aren't too hissable either although they do stink . And it's a pity we know who they are as soon as we see them but this was never intended to be used for suspense in the first place . But they really do stink the place out . You WANT them to die . Bartkowiak's direction is better than in his debut Romeo Must Die and adds a heavy dose of frenetic rush to such a fast-paced film . Action scenes are handled with experience and care . There is no MTV-style editing and no confusion to be had . He should have spent just a tiny little bit more time with the characters . It's not often that action movies have such strong characters and Exit Wounds does give us enough of them . Seagal has learned a little , just a little , more in the acting area but still doesn't know how to express himself much . There's too much frowning and not enough other emotions from Boyd . We do want to feel more from him but he won't allow us . I guess this is just how Seagal is . He just can't get away from himself too much no matter what role he plays . I wish Seagal would try harder . He'll win more fans this way . But it's good to see that he is in better condition than of late and has proved to Hollywood that he is still here and still frowning . Sadly he has chosen to star in loads of rather poor Asian movies since ( the real-life . Mob forced him into this ) and as we all await Under Siege 3 we don't hold our breath .
563801	102816	93220	10.0	Great Sequel	This non-related sequel is so sweet-natured , so tame and family orientated that to assume otherwise is completely ludicrous . There is nothing in this movie that could possibly rate it above a PG , max . I wouldn't even have reservations letting younger children watch House 2 . A new house has a 20-something yuppie called Jesse ( Arye Gross ) move in with his girlfriend Kate ( Lar Park-Lincoln ) . His friend Charlie ( Jonathan Stark ) , a music agent , arrives with his new diva discovery Jana ( Amy Yasbeck ) to help him thru the unfamiliar first few days . The house is where Jesse's parents were killed when he was just a baby and it full of many curiosities . Crafted in a bizarre Gothic-Aztec style the house itself is a marvellous set and the many rooms and passages are as mysterious to us as they are to Jesse . Sitting on one of his many mantelpieces is a crystal skull that fascinates him for some reason . He even misses his housewarming party while studying the skull's history . His studies lead him to dig up the grave of his great , great grandfather , or Gramps ( Royal Dano ) , where he discovers the old coot isn't dead just in limbo . The person who possesses the skull is granted eternal youth but it also warps the space-time continuum within the House . Gramps comes home with Jesse , is more enthralled by Kleenex boxes and TV than the mysteries around him and ducks for cover whenever someone from another time comes to steal the skull . Just like the first movie different rooms lead into different time zones . Jesse and Charlie have many hilarious adventures battling caveman , dinosaurs , Aztecs an evil cowboy called Slim . The one that killed Jesse's parents and betrayed Gramps over a century ago . House 2 has so much careless abandon and zany plot twists that it is totally impossible not to love this movie . The huge success of the first movie meant that this one was put into production literally and hour later and Ethan Wiley was given the budget and green light to do whatever he wanted . How often does happen today ? Usually it would make for a bad movie considering this was the first movie Wiley directed . But it makes for an unusually cute and light-hearted supernatural romp . One of the weaker aspects of this sequel is that it has more SFX and animation by Phil Tippet's stop-motion workshop and less by Dreamquest . The matte paintings are gorgeous but the dated dinosaurs look hokey in a few shots . If you can just squint during these moments you won't notice . Bill Maher from TV's " Politically Incorrect " even manages to show up as a music producer who is interested in Yasbeck and mighty suspicious of Jesse's antics . John Ratzenberger ( this makes both movies star one of the " Cheers " barflies ) appears as a repairman / adventurer who assists Jesse and Charlie battle some Aztecs . Look out for Kane Hodder ( Jason ) in an ape costume . Jesse adopts a fluffy , little baby pterodactyl and a strange creature called a Caterpuppy , a cross between . . . well you know . You need an open mind and a suspension of disbelief to swallow the outrageous goings on in this movie . The commentary is better than the one on the first movie . Ethan Wiley and Cunningham get on well and have no quibbles pointing out how crazy the film is . They discuss the budget , tell tales of the late Royal Dano and explain how many of the effects were pulled off within the constraints of the budget . One of the most interesting things they mention is that even tho the movie was stuck in between The Color Purple and Beverly Hills Cop II the kids still preferred House 2 as their fave movie of the summer . But because the movie didn't have it's own opening weekend , unlike the original , it wasn't as successful . Didn't stop 2 more sequels being made . A theatrical trailer is also included . Much like the first film the picture has been brilliantly transferred onto DVD . The 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture looks super with very few glitches . Colors are rendered with pleasant accuracy and you wouldn't believe the low-budget origins when judging this picture . There is some grain during darker scenes but other than this the movie is looking great . The Mono soundtrack is not terribly engaging and most of the film's sound is centre-channel biased . But there's no hiss or pop to worry about . It may be Mono but it's clean and fresh sounding to me .
564708	102816	118715	10.0	You see what happens , Larry ?	It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons . One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious . And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it . 144 sentences also end in ' man ' . Jeff ' The Dude ' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence . He has no job , no ambitions and no worries . His days , be they weekdays or weekends , are spent bowling , driving around or having the occasional acid flashback . His pals are Walter Sobchak , a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny , a humble , mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation . The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff ' The Big ' Lebowski , the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town . These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug . This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the ' Chinaman ' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski , as it's now HIM who owes a new rug . The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler , a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad . But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost . At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs , a powerful pornographer , a dejected feminist daughter , a Brother Seamus ( NOT an Irish Monk ) , a joyriding teenager , a revolting pederast champion bowler , Saddam Hussein , a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting . The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA , going from limo to limo , never too far from a white Russian or a doobie . There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it . Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that , like me , you'll be acting the film out for years . Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies , character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before . The acting is superb . I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film . He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self . John Goodman , in probably the most under-rated role of his career , is the world's angriest man . Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene ( though he's almost always right ) . Set well over a decade after ' nam ( and during the first Gulf conflict ) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual , ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation . Take a look at his ' minor ' confrontation with Smokey for example . It's not about plot , or even characters . It's about a certain moment in time , the early 90s . And the definitive man of that time was the Dude . The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously .
564563	102816	189072	10.0	Scooby and Shaggy take a break	I saw this like a hundred times when I was a kid and I did not think I would laugh at it as much as I did then . Especially considering this is old school Scooby animation and not the sleeker , brighter animation of recent years . I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this . It's even better than Scooby's most recent adventure ( The Monster of Mexico ) . There is no Mystery Inc or Mystery Machine in this movie . It's just Shaggy ( wearing a red shirt instead of a green one ) and Scooby ( and unfortunately , Scrappy , tho he doesn't feature prominently ) and Shag's girlfriend Googy . Shaggy lives in an alarmingly large , mansion-esque house and is chosen by Count Dracula to become a werewolf so he can take part in a race for monsters . Despite looking cute and cuddly as a Werewolf , Shaggy obviously doesn't want to do it but Dracula promises to change him back to human if he wins . What follows is a Scooby Doo version of the Wacky Races as insane customized cars battle it out on an anything-goes Transylvanian race-course . The majority of laughs come from Dracula , ever so desperate to keep his wicked plan from falling apart and always making a complete idiot of himself . It's also new to see Shaggy not jump into Scooby's arms every time he sees a monster . And this time they're real too , not just some guy in a mask . I would definitely recommend this to Scooby fans and those who are just total Scooby completists ( like me ) . It's very funny and totally rewatchable . The DVD is in 1 . 33 : 1 , as drawn and comes with a Dolby Mono soundtrack .
564112	102816	451177	10.0	A pioneering but phenomenally hard space-shooter	In 1987 shoot-em-up video games were hardly new . But R-Type gave new meaning to the term ' side-scrolling space-shooter ' . Featuring subliminal imagery , awe-inspiring bio-mechanical villains , jaw-clenching gameplay , brilliant music and amazing power-ups , R-Type set a new standard that was soon mimicked in more games to follow than you can shake a stick at . The story behind the game has earth come under attack from a race of mutant aliens called The Bydo Empire . Instead of sending a whole fleet of warships to fend them off a single R-series space vessel must penetrate the hordes of Bydo scum and make it to the core of the mothership and blast them back to the far side of the galaxy . It's hard . Very , very hard . And you'll be screaming with frustration . But that was the ingenuous part . IREM deliberately made the game near-impossible so you'd spend more money on it . And by jove it worked on me . Apart from several R-Type sequels , IREM never mounted to much after this . R-Type was their one hit wonder . Ported onto just about every home console you can think of , the best version of R-Type was always the arcade machine . If you see it , don't think twice about playing . And paying .
564511	102816	356197	10.0	A funny , but not faultless , return .	This Roadrunner cartoon preceded the awesome Looney Tunes : Back in Action movie . I saw it with a full house and everyone did find it funny ( plus it was cool to get a little extra bonus before the movie started ) . The animation is slick and modern and there are some real funny moments . The story behind this ' un sees a couple of dueling wizards wipe each other out . Wile E . Coyote comes across one of their spell books and instead of using shoddy acme products to catch the Roadrunner he decides to use a bit of magic . Though some of the timing is off . I didn't think the joke with the levitating boulder was funny at all and everyone could see it coming . Though the last few moments with the flying horse , the train , the scorpions and the flying shark were hilarious . A series of increasing misfortune making for a great end .
564537	102816	179626	10.0	A chilling twist on reality TV .	While reality TV is a long dead horse endlessly being flogged this action movie is so fresh and new and exciting . John Herzfield will make a great writer / director in the future if all of his output is this cool . I cannot believe that this is the same guy who wrote Turbulence and Stallone's dismal 1986 movie Cobra . I thought that Edward Burns and Robert DeNiro had excellent chemistry together and made a great team as the 2 good guys working for different factions . Their teaming up to catch the evil bad guys is very enjoyable . And the bad guys themselves are REALLY evil . The actors that played them were so good at oozing menace and greasy creepiness . A movie like this is made even better when you want the bad guys to be killed so much . Almost all scenes kick ass , especially when Edward Burns flicks the light-switch in the hooker's apartment and then the whole place bursts into flames . THAT is cool ! And when we see a graphic close-up of one of the bad guy's shot-up ankle ? ew ! The theme of the film is very satirical in how it deals with the media influencing law-enforcement and how almost everyone , be it for glamour or ghastliness , gets their Fifteen minutes of fame . The crude and ironic references to Frank Capra appeal to my morbid sense of humor . This film wasn't afraid to try anything new and daring . I mean what kind of film is brave enough to kill it's main character in the second act , especially when that character is played by Robert DeNiro . Kelsey Grammar's character was my fave tho . It's a shame he isn't in it much during the second act but it's hard not to like him . There is no convention or cliché here and I highly recommend this film . It seriously is so cool .
564195	102816	80487	10.0	Absolute Comedy Classic	Every single scene in this movie rocks big-time . It's hard to say which of the actors steal the show as Chase , Knight , Dangerfield and Murray try their best to run away with the movie . But if I had to make a decision I would have to say that this IS Dangerfield's movie . His sleazy , friendly , insulting , buffoonish and graciously tipping character is the centrepiece of this movie , which pre-dates the Airplane-style humor of visual gags and jokes . There ain't much plot but there is still more than there is in the standard comedy modern movies . The film cuts to about 5 different sub-plots at regular intervals . The funniest of which being Murray's ever ridiculous attempts to catch a pesky gofer . I love those scenes . The gopher looks so fake and so cute , he's literally a stuffed toy being moved by hand off-camera . Ted Knight's Judge Smails is a hoot . The pompous and self-important arrogance mixes well with his cluelessness of how to be gentlemanly towards people and his clumsiness . He is bull-headed , acting without thinking and always letting his rage get the better of him . This is a perfect personification of the majority of courtroom Judges . Chase does a good job as hedonistic playboy golfer Ty Webb and his ONLY scene with Bill Murray is THE best pure dialogue scene in film history . The total crap that they talk is funny as hell . And so is the whole movie . Forget the sequel . See this movie when you get the chance . The DVD is in 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Mono sound .
564532	102816	87078	10.0	A cheap , but funny and light-hearted sequel	Though being a fan of Robert E . Howard's short stories I must say that funny and light-hearted are definitely NOT the words I would use to describe Conan . The story this time has Conan go on a mission for the seductive Queen Taramis ( she can be my queen ANY day ) . He must retrieve a gemstone which unlocks another treasure called the Horn of Dagoth . A treasure that will bring to life an Evil God . Conan doesn't care as Taramis ( who was NOT a villain in Howard's short stories , her twin sister Salome however , definitely was ) has promised to bring back his dead girlfriend from the first film . And so with his ragtag group of companions : Malak ( a comedy sidekick , but what happened to Subotai from the original ? ) , Zula ( Grace Jones , wearing no more than a couple of inches of leather floss ) , Akiro ( Mako , the only returning cast member from the original ) , Bombaata ( on a secret mission to kill Conan ) and the virgin Princess Jehnna , Conan takes off on his mission . The first film was very , very serious but this one plays more like The Dark Crystal than a Conan film . The effects and sets are very typical of early ' 80s fantasy movies . The violence , though not entirely muted , has been toned down somewhat . Plus Conan talks a lot more in this one . I don't have a problem with this part as he is quite cunning and intelligent in Robert E . Howard's stories . I felt they kind of sold him short in the first film by limiting his dialogue . Some scenes reek of cheapness . The Toth-Amon / Man-Ape scene is so ridiculously fake . It makes you wonder how the filmmakers took it seriously . But it all it really does is add to the kitschy hokum of it all . And hokum and weirdness is what Howard's stories were all about . Basil Poledouris ' music is the one part of the film that is totally up to scratch . It's not as heavy as his score to the first film but he does introduce new , stronger themes and lighter takes on cues from the first . And the ending , featuring the resurrected Dagoth reduced to a sub-Godzilla demon is just plain stupid . Not silly . Even a few more minutes of thought put into this would have made it much better . It's a lot more formulaic and ' Hollywood ' than the first . No new ground is broken and it's obviously a film made quickly to cash in on the success of CtB . Another way in which Conan has been sold short . You can tell with some gimmicks present in both films that they were trying to turn this into a long-running series . A shame that never happened . Conan the Destroyer is silly , entertaining fun . But it lacks the serious impact of the original . Oh well , we'd better just sit tight until King Conan : Crown of Iron comes out , whenever that may be . Forget the shoddy , non-anamorphic , mono-sound tracked R1 DVD and get the R2 version . It has a much better cover-art and loads of extras including : commentaries , features and a brand new 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 5 . 1 sound .
564773	102816	29583	10.0	Marvelous Restoration	I can't believe the clarity of this DVD . You could swear that this movie was made yesterday by the eye popping color . I've seen some great restorations but this is by far the best , even moreso considering that this film is now 64 years old . Disney have outdone themselves . The movie itself is entertaining although it does seem a bit European at times . It does not take place in any particular country but some of the dwarves sound like they are from Kentucky . The abundance of cute animals and a surprisingly cruel villain keep this story watchable . I mean we have heard it a million times before but the dwarves have more character than Snow White who does nothing but look pretty . And who doesn't want the Evil Queen to get what's coming to her . The supplements on the DVD are MASSIVE and too many to even mention . Let me just say that if you are a fan of the film you certainly WON'T be disappointed . This baby is loaded and bursting at the seams . The DVD is in 1 . 33 : 1 full frame and is in Dolby 5 . 1 .
564041	102816	110066	10.0	Very good for a family movie	Most family movies seem hastily thrown together but HOUSEGUEST is an exception . The dialogue sparkles , the direction isn't just 2-takes-and-go , the cinematography is whackily speeded up in some places and the editing is rapid fire . And unlike most family movies , it lasts for 110 minutes . That's about half an hour longer than is usual . I know this hardly seems like a valid point but I reckon it proves the movie's got more content than fart jokes etc . My only gripe is the obvious McDonalds plugging about 40 minutes in . If you can just turn away for these 10 seconds then it's not so bad . It's a shame that it's there tho because it tarnishes the credibility of the movie . Sinbad is always good and the late , great Phil Hartman can make any film watchable so they really add to this brilliantly entertaining comedy . Do yourself a favour and watch it . It's not just for kids . I watched my VHS a zillion times and I was so impatient for this DVD to be released . So it's barebones , but who cares ? I'm just glad to have it . The 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic picture is super and the Dolby 2 . 0 surround track is decent enough . After all this is a dialogue driven comedy but some sound effects and music are presented pretty well . My subwoofer even go a big kick from a gunshot near the end . Pick this one up whenever you see it . No matter what age you are , you and your kids will enjoy .
564311	102816	77053	10.0	Absolutely wonderful TV show	I first saw Mork and Mindy when I was about five and thought it was the funniest thing on earth . I would even sit on my head like Mork did and I had some of the Mork toys too . So it's obvious I would grab this DVD box set as soon as it came out . And is Mork and Mindy as good today as it was back then ? Of course ! In fact it might be even better coz when you compare it to modern sitcoms M & M has more integrity as Robin Williams and Pam Dawber seem to be performing to a much rawer audience with more theatrical performances . Robin Williams is just completely crazy as Mork ( from Ork ) , an alien sent to Earth to investigate our strange customs and report back telepathically to Orson , his boss . Mindy is the girl he meets who gives him a home in her attic , much to the annoyance of her cynical dad . And , trust me , you can clearly see that Robin Williams often gives up the script to manically ad-lib his own madness while Pam Dawber runs after him , desperately trying to keep the show under control . It's so cool in certain moments when they're close together during a manic moment and she's looking into his eyes in amazement , petrified at what he's about to do next . He would also go crazy off-stage in an effort to distract Dawber when she had a scene on her own . Supporting characters are also cool . Mr Bickley , Mindy's dad and grandma , Eugene and the outrageous Exidor all grab as much attention as they can whenever Williams isn't going mental . David Letterman , Dana Hill , Tammy Lauren , Morgan Fairchild , Penny Marshall and Geoffrey Lewis show up in cameos too . Plus Fonzie is the first episode ( a flashback to Mork's first ever appearance in Happy Days ) . There are NO FEATURES AT ALL on the DVDs . Which is annoying seeing as how this time I would have liked to have seen stuff . But I'm just glad to have it . Hey , Paramount , give us Season 2 NOW ! ! ! The show is presented in 1 . 33 : 1 full frame , as originally shot . And for a 27 year old show it looks great with very little in the way of print damage or grain . The sound is plain old mono but it's fine for what it is . You MUST buy .
564545	102816	221169	10.0	Cool , but too short	The Fatal Fury franchise is full of promises and this first animated feature takes the characters beyond the video game boundaries . It's cool how the fighters ( Terry Bogard especially ) are written as being normal and sensitive rather than always butch , evil and trying to start a fight . The characters in the Street Fighter series were too much like this but Terry Bogard always appears innocent and his adult form still looks like the child he was at the beginning . But my fave character in Fatal Fury was always Geese Howard . He is such a cool bad guy and live action bad guys should be more like him . Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi are amusing supporting characters and make great sidekicks for Terry . The ending is a little too quick but when you consider that there is a follow up and a great animated movie it ain't so bad . If you like this one then the others should give you a good fix .
564474	102816	324216	10.0	Very bold and intense horror and a great DV	While I fully appreciate and respect the tastes of others , let me just say I have no idea why the original is held in such high regard . It was truly one of the worst films I have ever seen . Nothing happened in it . There was ZERO suspense or excitement , the dialogue was barely audible and it felt like another half of it was missing . I hated it and I am so puzzled why so many people love that film . Granted , back in 1973 it may have been easier to scare audiences and the low-budget nature of the original may have contributed to the ugly look of the film but I see no reason to credit the original director ( Tobe Hooper ) with any of the film's so-called qualities . The man's career fell flat on it's face soon after and I think his most famous movie was something of a fluke . It would not have succeeded today . Obviously , as I just said , audiences today are exposed to a larger number of movies and can choose and discriminate more easily . There are some who will say the only people who can enjoy this will be degenerate teenagers who don't know what real horror is . And some who will call the film to glossy . But none of this I find fair criticism . I am , in no way , a fan of Michael Bay or any of his movies . But he had the right idea in keeping the budget very low for this movie ( $8 million ) and seems to be more skilled in packaging and producing than directing . The film is not ' glossy ' or ' clean ' . The equipment use to make the film is more sophisticated than that on the original but this is not ' The Rock ' or ' Armageddon ' and there are no hundred-shots-in-a-second and flashy camera tricks . They all tried their best to pull of a nervous , raw horror film that stands on it's own and I think they have . This was sooooooo much better than the first . The characters actually HAVE character this time . I got on their side , I got involved in the action ( yes , there is action this time , and a LOT of it ) and the acting was done well . Plus Jessica Biel is VERY hot . So many new dimensions and situations occur is this remake that elevates to something a zillion times what the original was . Don't automatically think that because Michael Bay is the producer that it's going to be some kind of sanitised and fashion-shoot Hollywood production . It is still a very edgy and intense film . It's rare that a Hollywood film manages to horrify and offend these days , so I'm very glad the new TCM went for a hard R-rating . The tone is so filthy and depraved that you will definitely need to shower soon afterwards . THAT'S how close you get to the action . Even the character of Thomas ' Leatherface ' Hewitt has a lot more to do this time . He's not quite Jason Voorhees but he's still an incredibly mean bad guy you'd NEVER want to mess with or come within 10 miles of . And in case you're wondering , he's played by the same dude who played Butterfinger , the big , dumb blonde guy from Hudson Hawk . Only this time he's not so cuddly . Not since 8mm almost 5 years ago have I seen a film where the bad guys ( there's more than one ) are nothing but the blackest of all evil . R . Lee Ermey was terrific ( as usual ) as the disgusting Sheriff and any fans of him should only expect the most badass of performances . Second to Dawn of the Dead ( and tying with House of 1000 Corpses ) this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time . The Platinum Series DVD is just awesome . The 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture is superb and the Dolby 6 . 1 / DTS ES soundtracks are incredible . You'll really think Leatherface is chainsawing his way into YOUR living room . There are also a massive load of interesting extras including a 75-minute documentary , deleted scenes , a documentary on serial killer Ed Gein ( who was ' supposedly the inspiration for the original but Tobe Hooper denied these rumors ) and screen test footage . The packaging is awesome with a metal plate stuck on the front cover and ' crime scene ' photos in a little envelope tucked into back . It completes a great package of a great DVD of a great movie . Buy it ! ! !
564349	102816	42512	10.0	Daffy lays a golden egg .	One day down on Porky's farm , a hen lays a golden egg but refuses to come forward because of what happened to the goose who once laid such a thing . Instead every other hen points to Daffy when Porky comes asking . Daffy , obviously shocked at such an accusation and too surprised to know what he's actually doing in a henhouse confirms or denies nothing . As soon as he's made famous in the media , Rocky the gangster kidnaps him and forces him to lay as many eggs as possible . You really do feel for Daffy in this one as , for the first time , he doesn't make the trouble for himself and panics as the threats mount and the golden eggs are not laid . Daffy is the best !
564037	102816	106309	10.0	VERY GOO	This movie is very well made and has a decent plot . The editing may be a little ham-fisted in places but the shoot-outs are far from simple and the car chases rival that of even RONIN . It also has a sly sense of humour and self aware of it's stupidity . I like the music , it's highly thematic . I like George Segal's character , adding a little class to the oily villain he plays and Dolph is good . He's always good . Much better than Seagal or Van Damme or Stallone . It's a pity he's not in many high profile movies . But this one is definitely one of his best .
564365	102816	92644	10.0	The best of the three	Up to scratch in all areas apart from the editing . I'll get to that later . This one sees Axel head back to Beverly Hills after a 3-year gap to solve the Alphabet crimes . The film is more violent than the original and is truer to the Simpson / Bruckhiemer films that followed . When you compare this movie to more recent flicks like Con Air or Gone In 60 Seconds you can see a definite resemblance in style . These movies have very fast editing to heighten the action . Obviously the editors practised on this movie as the editing is very bad and there are many continuity mistakes . It doesn't retread the same ground either . The first summed up what Beverly Hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent Americans live in when they have more money than they can spend . As Axel says ' These rich people loose their minds and want to live in a donut ' , when describing to a building foreman that there are not supposed to be any right angles in the house he is about to ' steal ' . The music has improved a bit too . Even if some of it is a direct rip-off of the music in John Carpenter's Escape From New York . It's a shame the music ( not songs ) from these films is not available on soundtrack . Give Beverly Hills Cop 2 a chance and don't listen to the narrow-minded critics who panned this film ( 13 years ago ) . It is also the only one of the 3 that is in 2 . 35 : 1 .
564348	102816	42270	10.0	Daffy is the REAL Looney Tune	He's completely crazy that's for sure . And at the beginning of this cartoon we see him as happy as can be in his grassy valley with his pond . He hops and skips around without a care in the world . . . until Porky Pig shows up to do a scenic painting and maybe catch a fish or two . Naturally , Daffy isn't pleased at these distubances and does everything in his power to rile up Porky , including several disguises and constantly ringing his fishing line bell . The funniest part is when Daffy rips out Porky's car engine and climbs inside . When Porky tries to start the car Daffy makes spluttering and wheezing noises . Absolute class , until Porky ties him up and forces to be the REAL engine of the car . That duck can never just enjoy his happiness .
564805	102816	92796	10.0	A great trio	I'll review these short movies in order . First we have " Old Chief Woodenhead " in which an old convenience store clerk is robbed and killed by thugs . His wooden statue of a Native American warrior comes to life and takes them down . It's a little slow and doesn't have a lot going on but it still cool and well directed . The second part is " The Raft " and is surely my favorite and the scariest . 4 teenagers enjoy a carefree Indian summer at a secluded lake where there is a large raft stuck in the middle . Once they swim out of the raft a huge blob of carnivorous , organic sludge comes along eats one of them up . It seems to have the ability to dissolve human flesh pretty quickly and wont go away until it's eaten the other 3 . We never know what the blob is or where it came from but I reckon that you'll find this one to be more involving than the others . The final story is " The Hitchhiker " in which Mrs Lansing , a neurotic upper class woman runs , over a man , trying to hitch a ride , completely by accident . She thinks it best to simply drive away from the scene and leave him be . But then she begins to have hallucinations ( ? ) of him coming back to get her . And no matter how many times she runs him over and smashes him to pieces he seems to continue coming back and coming back despite the fact he becomes more and more disintegrated . It's not scary but it's fun to watch her become increasingly deranged , as she cannot get rid of him . In between all of these little movies there is an ongoing animated story of a kid buying the Creepshow comic book and ordering killer plants to eat up his enemies . The Creep ( Tom Savini under heavy make-up ) introduces each story to us in much the same manner as The Crypt Keeper in Tales from the Crypt . Even the comic book to film fades resemble the Crypt TV series . But is there actually a Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt comic book ? I would appreciate it if someone gave me an answer to this . It's bugged me for a long time . Look out for Stephen King as a trucker in " The Hitchhiker " .
564012	102816	42418	10.0	No one leaves empty handed	A rather different approach to a ( radio ) quiz show . If you don't answer the impossible questions in a ridiculously short time you get tortured with falling boulders , cascading water , conveyor-belts with those spinning saws and whacks of a mallet to the head . Daffy Duck is wonderful as the demented host dishing out pain and humiliation to Porky Pig . But even Porky has his limits and soon turns the tables on the delightfully devilish Daffy . The entire cartoon is set in a sound studio so there's not much going on with the backgrounds . In this respect it's kinda simplistic . But when that small space is filled with such hyper-madness who can refuse ?
564039	102816	118880	10.0	Best action film of the late 90s	Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it . Nic Cage ( in a typically bad performance ) is Cameron Poe , a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife . After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird . But this is no ordinary flight . On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus ' The Virus ' Grissom ( John Malkovich ) a men on death row for murder , robbery , kidnapping and extortion . Nathan ' Diamond Dog ' Jones ( Ving Rhames ) , a black militant inside for murder . Billy Bedlam ( Nick Chinlund ) , inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog . Pinball Parker ( Dave Chapelle ) , a pimp and drug-dealer . Swamp Thing ( MC Gainey ) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack . And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler ( Steve Buscemi ) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat . As you can tell , with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose . As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over , restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America . Poe , being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is , doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help . It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin ( John Cusack ) and the cavalry can get there . Easier said than done , as double-crosses , suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up . The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic , devastating climax upon another anarchic , devastating climax . At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation . Con Air is everything an action film should be . Steve Buscemi steals the whole show . His deadpan , bug-eyed and dare I say ' innocent ' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film . The scene where he sings with a little girl ( and continues later on ) will either freak you out or steal your heart . And the ending is the best you could hope for . Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud , blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare . It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the ( sadly incomplete ) score CD . And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one . Superior to both The Rock and Face / Off , Con Air is Nic Cage at his ( worst ) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer . See it , for the love of God , see it .
564102	102816	290983	10.0	Now THIS is more like it !	Truly the BEST ever incarnation of Spiderman and the best animated show EVER ! ! ! Compared to previous animated Spidey's this was bold move , taking it in new , more mature and realistic directions . The 60's and 90's shows seem tame and childish in comparison . Taking place after the Spider-Man movie this show revolves around the college adventures of Peter , Mary-Jane and Harry who have much better chemistry , character and dialogue than the movie ever offered . Each episode provides more drama and development and creativity . The stories are very imaginative and are obviously written by people who are passionate about Spiderman rather than a studio hashing a product together . The computer animation is superb and resembles The Ultimate Spiderman comic book ( my fave ) more than anything . And I know Mary-Jane is only a CGI character but she is so beautiful , and she's voiced by the equally gorgeous Lisa Loeb . Neil Patrick Harris is the voice of Peter Parker and even in this performance he is a hundred times better than Tobey Maguire . The show also offers some new , interesting characters like Indy , Cheyenne and Silver Sable and gives us alternate takes on Electro and Kraven . Though I was curious as to why Aunt May was not involved . There is plenty of action and excitement to be had in every episode , all backed up to great music , MAN IS THAT THEME TUNE AWESOME ! Where is the soundtrack CD ? The show could not have asked for a better DVD presentation . Not only do we get an absolutely stunning 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen presentation but a thumpingly good , totally engaging DTS 5 . 1 soundtrack too . Each episode is a 22-minute movie that is far superior to anything the live-action effort was . There are also an abundance of extras on this 2-disc set , some interesting , some not . But a seriously good package for a great show . You must buy ! Fan or no fan of Spidey this DVD is too good to be without .
564808	102816	114563	10.0	Everything the movie wasn't	In my opinion the movie didn't exist . This Animated version of the Streetfighter story is a zillion times as good . The characters are stronger and although there are quite a few of them they are all developed enough for us to sympathise / hate them . It seems as if the makers of this film paid extra attention to every area of production in order to make a film that couldn't possibly be improved upon . They almost succeeded . Unfortunately I saw the " Americanised " version of the film which replaces an awesome musical score with grunge rock music and cuts out Chun Li's nudity before her fight with Vega . Speaking of Vega , doesn't he remind of Jason Voorhees . He was definitely a cool character . They all were apart from M . Bison . He is the only fault the film has because for a central villain . He doesn't do much apart from stand statue still and say in a very deep ( that MUST make him evil ) voice that he is superior to everyone else and that they are all " weak pathetic fools " and that his henchmen must " seize them " . Boring . It is such a shame that a great movie had such a lame villain . But it's the set ( ? ) pieces that make this film stand out from other Anime movies . The fight on the wing of the plane is ultra cool . Ken Masters is just driving thru the Pacific Northwest countryside when this huge plane comes out of nowhere and he is suddenly fighting M . Bison on top of it . The final battle outside Honda's shack in the mountains is also very cool . I reckon Honda is my fave character . The ending was a little suspicion tho . Just what is the deal with that truck ? Anyways , the Streetfighter franchise knows it's full potential and I recommend that you check out all of the DVDS that are available out there .
564087	102816	114608	10.0	Zane steals the show	I was a big fan of the Tales from the Crypt TV show . Thus , I am a big fan of this movie . It feels a lot like one of the Creepshow movies but has enough gore , humor and OTT carnage to make it stand on it's own as well as being a big screen spin-off . Brayker ( William Sadler ) is a drifter who stumbles upon a lonely desert town after an explosive confrontation with The Collector ( Billy Zane ) , a supremely evil being with Satanical powers who is desperate to get his hands on Brayker's mysterious talisman . Brayker spends the night in a shabby motel but The Collector soon turns up and unleashes hell upon the motel and it's inhabitants . This is where the fun really kicks in . The Collector has fun enticing the residents ( made up of Dick Miller , Charles Fleisher , Thomas Haden Church , Brenda Bakke , Jada Pinkett-Smith and CCH Pounder ) to join him on his dark quest and steal the talisman from Brayker . Director Ernest Dickerson ( who also did Surviving the Game ) does not hold back on the gore as he spoofs 1950's B-movies , honor's the TV show and pays brilliant homage to the Tales From The Crypt comic book legacy . It may seem like a cheap , horror comedy with no artistic integrity but Dickerson successfully pulls of a movie that will satisfy and entertain anyone who watches it . Of course half of the movie's appeal lies with Billy Zane who acts out the role of The Collector with such wicked charm and delightful evil . You can tell he's having a great time and he makes a formidable villain for Sadler's dishevelled hero . They should make more Tales From The Crypt movies , but producer's Robert Zemeckis , Gilbert Adler and Joel Silver ( Walter Hill and David Giler ducked out ) went on to found Dark Castle , the production company behind House on Haunted Hill , Thir13en Ghosts and Ghost Ship . The new DVD by Universal is better than the old one from Image . This time be get the film in it's proper aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic with a Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack . The old snapper case is gone and in it's place is a sturdy keep case . Demon Knight is definitely one to get .
564376	102816	114906	10.0	Disturbing but funny , even it makes you feel guilty	Welcome to the Dollhouse is a lot like the recent Napoleon Dynamite . Both have the cast decked out in hideous wardrobes with horrid 1970's-looking environments . Both are about high-school oddballs who face torment from the shallow popular kids . But while Napoleon Dynamite is rather light-hearted , WTTD is really dark and will make you cringe with guilt and quite often make you feel really uncomfortable . In fact , it has more in common with a true horror movie than it does a dark comedy . Heather Matarazzazzazzo plays the unfortunately surnamed Dawn Weiner , a girl blessed with strange looks ( meh-I like her ) and an uncaring ignorant family . E-ver-y-one around her is UN-BEE-LEEV-ABLY cruel to her in every way possible . And rage unconfronted continues forever . As are her bullies bullied themselves , Dawn goes on to bully others etc . It subtle idiosyncrasies like this that might go unnoticed in single viewings . Other characters are quite well drawn , especially Brandon , who didn't get enough screen time . His relationship with Dawn is quite intriguing . Most would think he's using her as a way of making himself feel better but when you think about it that's probably not entirely true . Perhaps Brandon likes Dawn because she isn't nasty to him like Cookie and the other girls were . She wasn't tarting all over him like Lolita in the library and she stood up to Brandon for punching Troy . Also Brandon apologises to her for vandalising her locker and the sad looks he gives her in the library appear to be a look of longing and wanting . Ironically , the biggest monster in the film is Dawn's own mother . She's a beast of a woman , completely ignorant of Dawn's needs and infatuated with her other younger daughter and far too supportive of her arrogant older brother ( his character is further developed in Todd Solondz's 2004 movie Palindromes , played by the same actor ) . Any scene with her will make you grit your teeth and shake your head no doubt . Too bad Heather Matarazzazzazzo is married ( err . . . to another woman-sigh . . . no chance for me now ) cause she's actually quite attractive in real life . Though I must say again her wardrobe in this film is ' EEK ' Seriously , you'll be questioning Dawn's fashion sense . But then she's probably only wearing what her mother buys for her and wants her to be seen in . If this movie impresses you then I dare you to check out Todd Solondz's follow-up Happiness . Now THERE is a film to dark and so unbelievably horrifying you'll be watching it through the gaps between your fingers and biting your lip in an effort to restrain the guilty laughter . But on it's own , WTTD is a great movie . Just don't show it to kids if your not down with frank portrayal of teen sexuality or bad language . Or do show them as a lesson in how NOT to treat people . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 2 . 0 sound . The print is a little beat up with track lines and speckles but it doesn't distract too much . There are no extras but I don't care .
