515277	317399	1213644	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Disaster Movie	I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie . It is without a doubt a total disaster . I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made , after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans ( OK , I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie ) , because while it's spoof after spoof , it certainly isn't cheap trying to replicate certain stuff , even if done laced with loads of cheese , or swede-d . Should there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together , then it would be Cloverfield , where a group of friends Will ( Matt Lanter , whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right ? ) , Calvin ( G . Thang ) , Juney ( Crista Flanagan ) , Lisa ( Kimberly Kardashian ) and the Enchanted Princess ( Nicole Parker ) journey to save Amy ( Vanessa Minnillo ) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity , where the threat of mankind is raining cows . The only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie , be it borrowing characters or premise . You'd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy , and frankly speaking , they're at best some skits which for the life of me , are totally unfunny . Nada , zilch , nothing to laugh about . I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off . Which is not strange , considering that even jokes were borrowed , and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour , which is already so tired . While there are comedies which can be original , the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer , coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie ( s ) , would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation . Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing , but making a genuine and workable comedy is another . Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with , but I'm likely to think that everyone approached , save for the relative no-names here , would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole , just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography . I think it's even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer . The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions , and given some belt-tightening in the economy , hopefully this should be soon .
515477	317399	278674	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Return to Pontianak	Asian horror movies have always been popular here , and even local film The Maid by Kelvin Tong managed to strike gold at the box office , here and overseas as well , going against the grain of thought that local movies do not make money . However , in the recent surge of local movie making , there was another Singapore horror movie made , Return to Pontianak , which seemed to hold some promise with its reimagining / retelling of the legendary Malay female spirit . There were signs that it was bad - a friend's warning , and the turnout for the screening was a paltry 10-15 persons , but I just had to watch it for myself . The verdict ? This made in 2001 movie reeks , and reminds you of failed attempts by filmmakers around the world in taking something quite established , and then giving their own creative spin on it . While some might work , most of them will go the way of the Hollywood Godzilla . If this Pontianak were to go head long with the original Pontianak in a one on one , director Djinn's version will be made to wash the original's flowing white garbs . While the originals made in the 50s and 60s ( I watched Sumpah Pontianak starring Maria Menado ) were cheesy and lacking in grand special effects , they had a lot of heart . This one absolutely doesn't . Made after the highly successful Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) , this is one movie which should be seen , as a lesson learnt in how NOT to make a horror film . It's strange that much of it emulated Blair Witch , with its forest setting , characters roaming around getting routinely lost , and its highly puke inducing jerky camera motions . While Blair Witch had a reason for it , Return to Pontianak's boils down to budget . Neither has it any scary moments or atmosphere , aside from some mumbo-jumbo recitings and the awful soundtrack which is a horror in itself . While characters in most horror movies are throwaways , and only in established classics that you have a tinge of development , the characters developed for Return to Pontianak are those that happen to be of the irritating kind . They don't look good ( Hollywood compensates for the lack of story with awesome eye candy ) , and neither do they spout interesting lines . Dialogue is awful and contrived , and the bad sound design makes things worse . Caricatures abound , you have a group of five , led by the protagonist called Charity ( Hiep Thi Le ) ( the last time I heard this name was in Hong Kong's StormRiders ) , who developed a sudden urge to seek out her biological parents in the jungles of Pontianak ( hence the title , other than the reference to the " hantu " ) . Joining her are a fugly man-girl called Uzi ( Eleanor Lee ) , whose mouth is automatically set to spout vulgarities like a sub-machine gun , an ignorant slacker ang mo Luke ( Steve Banks ) , the boring techno-geek Raymond ( Victor Khong ) , and a pretty useless and incompetent local guide called Eye ( Fadali ) . For the first hour , nothing much happens , and you have to endure bad bitching , bad acting , bad acting , bad sound , bad cinematography . That is until a mysterious couples appear , and the clich√©s associated with horror movie making come out in some force , although bad makeup , and more bad acting continue to plague the movie . Thankfully , the sound design improved in the last 30 minutes , but that's because most of the time the movie is silent , save for the rustling sounds of a tropical rainforest . And what of Pontianak herself ? Well , she comes out in the day . Which is preposterous . And she's totally lacking in prowess that made her infamous . Worse yet , this Pontianak is totally devoid of motivations and origins , and doesn't differentiate herself with any other ordinary ghost and goblin out there . For anyone not versed in the Pontianak lore , you might wonder what's the big deal . All in all , an extremely poor retelling . But if there is any consolation , it's that perhaps the filmmakers learnt from this bad episode , and given Djinn's Perth ( 2005 ) , you can see a fairly large jump in terms of storytelling craft . A better budget probably helped , and maybe the realization that something more rooted to earth is the better path for him ? Retitled Voodoo Nightmare for the overseas market , this movie has not much voodoo magic , but plenty of nightmares . Nightmares of a movie gone totally wrong .
515193	317399	781392	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Black Night	When I can sit through a horror genre film and actually poke fun at its stupidity , then you know that there really is nothing to be afraid of . While the attempt is good , the delivery is pretty bad . The acting's mediocre at best , and the ghouls look extremely cheap . A Pan-Asian production , we see three different stories , each done with a different director helming the production . What I disliked about the movie is it's passing off 3 distinct horror shorts as a feature length production . They tried to have a unifying theme / element throughout , and it turned out to be the rehash of Ju-On / Dark Water . It's time horror filmmakers know to move on . Not everything must be from puddles of water and little boys you know ? " Next Door " is the Hong Kong portion , directed by Patrick Leung . We see a love triangle being formed between 2 girls and a guy . Well , make that 1 girl , 1 guy and 1 vengeful female spirit , who probably deserved to die in the first place for engaging in kinky sex games involving handcuffs . The ending's pretty ridiculous , and drew laughter rather than terror . What's worse , the characters can't seem to decide what language to speak in . From Cantonese to Mandarin , then to a mixture of both in the same sentence , it suggested that the filmmakers are suffering from lingua-schizophrenia ( ooh , did I just create a new term ? ) . The twist in the end is plain blah , and the little marble boy served no purpose other than to create cheap scares . " Black Hole " is the Japanese section , directed by Takahiko Akiyama . This one provided better scares with its horrific eyes-hollowed-out ghosts and special effects , but the storyline's a plain bore , about an aquarium usher having her past memory wiped out due to some early childhood trauma . It's psycho-analytical blabber which should have shut up and let the scares do the talking . Again there's a little boy involved , and again , a body of water plays an important element . But we don't really care much about it now , do we ? " The Lost Memory " is perhaps the best amongst all three . Directed by Thai Thanit Jitnukul , at least it had a relatively stronger storyline , one which tried to tug at your heartstrings as it dealt with family - an estranged husband and wife , and their child . It talks about promises , and the seeking of closure and forgiveness . But it reeks of Ju-On all over again , and the little boy looked like a Hulk reject with his green skin . Perhaps the only scary factor was the loud fall onto the toilet bowl . Really made you feel the pain . From Reincarnation to Black Night , this week's dark offerings are a joke , a meek attempt to make some moolah . Don't get conned - either watch something else which is worth your time , or wait for the right horror movie to come by . The little boy in Omen666 looks scary enough though - hold onto your hell money for / 06 .
515549	317399	780595	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Redline	You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed . That's why movies like Fast and the Furious , Dhoom , Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences , especially local ones . We live on a tiny island , and I cannot fathom why , for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system , most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 % tax when they reach our shores , and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one . Not only that , the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear , lest they reach the sea . And these movies are relatively easy to make . Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic . For once , those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long , can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these . Of course there are amongst us ( ahem ) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects ( otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models , and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame ) , however , they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen , even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park . The guy sitting beside me , I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car ( s ) appear , and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans . So there we have it , the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie . With the Fast and the Furious franchise , the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage , as does the GT . Here , the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification , that even I'm impressed , alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos , Porshe Carerra GTs , Koenigsegg CCXs , and every car out there that has wings for doors . But seriously , my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment . I mean , this are perfectly fine , high performance models that are at the apex of motoring , but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow , they do so because they can , There's no story in Redline , just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties ( the cars that is ) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible , and with the usual shots of pedals ( always the accelerator , mind you , tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy , and earn you no respect ) , steering wheels , gear shifts ( always shifting up and not down ) , all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine , snarling and giving each other dirty looks . Not a very tall order for an actor , and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever , with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids . The heroine ( yes , it made a statement that girls can drive ) Natasha ( a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin ) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil , who has racing pedigree within her , and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable ( every line had to do with cars , and when singing about love , just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts , lubricants and going for rides ) . Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous ( Eddie Griffin ) , she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran , and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle . Everything else , well like I said , just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race . And it's almost always the same , as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars , especially when you know the race is rigged ( for narrative reasons ) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line . While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors , and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker , Sun Kang , and of course , the star it created - Vin Diesel , Redline had none , just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately . It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go , with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man , one car , and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas . If not for the cars , then this movie seriously is a piece of junk , with bad acting , bad lines and bad action . Strictly for the car fans , or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines .
514629	317399	454457	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Frostbiten	To think I was once avoiding horror movies because I thought I was chicken . Hell , I now believe the real reason's cause there are so many bad horror movies out there , that it's just not worth the time and money to watch them on the big screen . This Swedish movie unfortunately , is one of them . Frostbiten started off promisingly , with a link back to the horrors of WWII , where soldiers were being cut down in size by the enemies . They stumble onto an unused hut , but before they can get a good night's rest , they realize that there is something mysterious about the entire place , and got attacked by strange creatures . It's quite an extended scene before the opening title , but we get fast forwarded to today . Mother and daughter Annika ( Petra Nielsen ) and Saga ( Grete Havnesk√∂ld ) come to a new town to start life anew , but before they get settled down , it's a mixed bag of incidents which see Annika uncovering a deep dark secret in the hospital she works in , and Saga's teenage friends getting high on an experimental drug without their knowledge , and get turned into vampires . So begins a battle on both fronts as they fend off vampire rejects from Underworld . The story is nothing to shout about , being very weakly made up of lame excuses just to feature the vampires in various fang-sinking-into-necks opportunities . Plenty of things went wrong , right up until its ending , which tried to be too intelligent for its own good with a suggestive open ended ending , and it doesn't make much sense . At times , the movie's littered with humour , but in cheesy ways as it wasn't able to decide whether to be funny , or dead serious with the antics . It's nothing scary , but there were copious amounts of blood used to up the gore factor . Come to think of it , certain production aspects turned out quite childish with its lack of attention to continuity issues , although there were some sparks of brilliance in its special effects department . Other than that , if you really want to experiment with a foreign language horror movie , just wait for the discs to arrive .
515575	317399	855824	2.0	A Nutshell Review : I Don't Want to Sleep Alone	I don't want to sleep alone - if you have incredible patience , then you probably won't have to . Otherwise , within 10 minutes , you'll fall into deep sleep , as did somebody in the same screening I went to . I have put off writing the review to see if my opinion would change , and I dare say it has mellowed down . I would have loved to condemn this Tsai Ming-Liang movie , but just like any other movie , its bound to have its lovers and detractors . I for one , disliked the film , but acknowledge its technical merits . Simply put , the movie tells 2 stories , one involving a man ( played by Tsai's muse Lee Kang - Sheng ) being attacked by gangsters , and taken in and cared for by a construction worker ( Norman Atun ) , while the other story involves a comatose man ( also starring Lee ) being nursed by Chyi ( Chen Shiang-Chyi ) , a coffeeshop waitress working for Pearlly Chua's sexually repressed coffeeshop owner . In classic Tsai style , these stories are told in long , static shots , little or no dialogue , and through songs . The usual themes of alienation , repression , loneliness etc ( fill in the blanks , you know the themes already ) is commonplace in the movie , so much so that they become turn offs . At times you wonder if it's a comedy of absurdity , and if the movie is a waste of film and resources . You also scratch your head wondering if those who have praised the movie sky high are out of their minds , or if they're following the bandwagon and praising the emperor's new clothes . However , I did enjoy the first few minutes of the movie when Lee's wandering man walked around the seedier streets of KL . In fact , there isn't really much clues that it's KL , it can be Geylang for all you care . And possibly every dark corner and roadside become commonplace as the narrative moves along . If anything , Tsai is an inspiration , for his minimalist art form that makes as if almost anyone could pick up a camera , gather some actors ( or friends with zero facial expression - you can mask them , or film from across the road so there are no close up shots to betray their lack of ability ) around , and make something out of nothing . Just as how crazy men are called eccentric rather than mad if they have power and money , you'll just have to convince that you're an auteur with an amazing eye for details , instead of being called a crap filmmaker if you try and emulate his style . To some it's pretentious , to others it's a contemporary classic in the works . The only way to best judge if you would like the movie , is to watch it yourself . Just be warned that you'll either be enamoured by it , or come out swearing every vulgarity you've ever known . I sure heard many colourful words when the mattress started to float . If compared to his previous work The Wayward Cloud , I'd find that a masterpiece . But then again , I've always liked my movies with song , dance , things that move , not just a reluctant handjob . Will I watch future Tsai's works ? Sure , if only as a test of true patience , for film school lessons and references , and to share in the perverse joy of listening out for newbies to Tsai movies as they exercise their freedom of colourful speech . They are a vocal bunch after all . Recommended only for hard core Tsai fans , and no one else .
515556	317399	955411	3.0	A Nutshell Review : The Ten Commandments	I suppose Biblical stories will never run out of fashion , though I find it a bit strange that amongst the numerous potential stories for retelling , the story of Moses got chosen again , and for an animated movie no less , although this one's done in 3D . Remember Prince of Egypt ? Dreamworks Animation pretty much nailed it , especially when you have a relatively successful hit song as a byproduct ( played ad nauseam until it became an irritant ) . Comparisons are inevitable given the content and the form , and unfortunately , this movie with input from IVL Animation ( Singapore ) didn't surpass the benchmark set by Prince of Egypt , but it's a slight improvement to the local 3D animated movies that have been released to date ( that of Zodiac : The Race Begins and Tales of the Sea ) . The Ten Commandments that this version offered is a super summary of events that are in the Bible , starting from an infant Moses in a basket surviving a water borne trip , and bypassing his growing up years creatively through the opening credits . If using Cecil B . DeMille's 1956 movie starring Charlton Heston as the baseline , then it managed to shear off more than 50 % of that content , and added just a little bit more toward the last act , which seemed to drag it just a tad longer , including events that you may or may not already be familiar with , but definitely not in the DeMille film , nor in Prince of Egypt . As an animated movie , and a 3D one at that , it still has not reached the level of quality that one is accustomed to from , say Pixar , which in my opinion deem worthy to be used to measure up against . The animation here is still blocky at certain bits , especially in character design and rendering . But credit has to be given for how key scenes were depicted , and I thought the Burning Bush was particularly well done . Other than that , the Parting of the Red Sea was another key moment , but unfortunately didn't offer any spectacular Wow moment that the earlier Ten Commandment movies provided . It pales compared to the 2D style in Prince of Egypt , though it included a nod towards it of sorts by having those whales ( ? ) swimming around and seen through the water curtain . The movie managed to snag a more international cast for its voicing of characters , and I thought having Christian Slater ( Moses ) , Alfred Molina ( Ramses ) and Elliot Gould as the Voice of God , was a marked leap forward in helping the movie gain more attention , compared to the use of local actors ( no disrespect of course ) who may not have as much international clout to make the film appealing to audiences outside our borders . This movie will most likely appeal to Sunday School groups , given that it's relatively free of scary images , but yet managing to tell the story of various plagues descending onto Egypt .
515229	317399	437179	3.0	A Nutshell Review : See No Evil	WWE ( or WWF back then ) stars are no strangers to taking that leap into the movie world , with legends like Hulk Hogan starring in B-movies like Suburban Commando and Thunder in Paradise , or more contemporary figures like The Rock starring in various action movies like Walking Tall and The Scorpion King . Not only the lead roles , but they take on smaller bit roles like Diesel's stint as The Russian in the Marvel comic book movie The Punisher . Being a heroic or an evil character doesn't matter , as they entertain in the wrestling ring switching allegiances and trade karma like changing underwear , and since it's mostly action movies , the acting chops are not required , as their physical presence more than make up what's lacking , not that they don't do a lot of acting in ring though . See No Evil stars WWE's Kane as a psychotic killer with a penchant for digging out the eyes of his victims . Some which you'd get to see on screen , some which the censors deem too graphic for an NC16 rated flick and left on the cutting room floor ( better luck with M18 or R21 I'd say ) . Anyway from those scenes , it looked as if it's so easy to claw anyone's eye out ( is it really ? ) . So with his assortment of weapons like the axe , the hook and chain , or just his bare hands with brute strength befitting a 7 footer , he cuts one mean looking reject from the recent The Hills Have Eyes zombie character . I hate to use a classic as a comparison , but suffice to say that the premise stinks of being a poor man's cousin of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho filed with generous doses of MTV styled quick cuts . Instead of Bates motel , you have Blackwell Hotel , together with the suggestion that it is the all domineering and crazed mother whose warped upbringing nurtured humanity's monster . Taking yet another swipe at religious zealots too , as flashbacks show the young psycho kid being tortured by a mom who cages him and the punishment dished out for looking at porn ( hence the title see no evil lah ) . Packed into the movie are the various fodder for him to maim and kill . Character development , or at least the attempt in trying to weave in a tale of revenge , seem to be abandoned halfway , as characters start to drop off like barflies . It doesn't take you too long to realize who's on which side , and who'll survive ( according to horror slasher flick lore that the blondie and those having sex must die ) given the clich√©s . Starring relative unknowns as a bunch of inmates sent to the Hotel to perform cleaning fatigues , it's a pity that most of them were not given glorious cinematic deaths in a movie like this . Perhaps with movies like Hills Have Eyes , the Saw franchise , and Hostel , we're all a bit jaded from the rehashed dark and dankly film sets and throwaway characters . There's nothing new presented in this movie , and is only made for Kane's fan base . Even then , with so little of their star seen in the flesh , they might as well be better off with his exploits in the wrestling ring . Stay tuned until after the initial end credits roll for a cheeky scene , which absolutely will never happen in the ring against Kane .
515331	317399	996605	4.0	A Nutshell Review : Love Songs	In the running for the Palme d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival , Love Songs by Christophe Honore was nothing like what the writeup used in the festival synopsis would have let you believe . Either that , or I'm really dense to have trusted what was essentially a verbatim recap of only the first of three segments that this movie was split into ? Departure , Absence and Return . Rather than dwell on the non-existent and off screen man√®ge-a-trios , it's more of a tale of grief and the handling of grief after personal tragedy . It seemed like an exploration of venturing into the extremes , of being experimental for the sheer thrill of it , of trying to lead a vastly different lifestyle in other to drown all memories of the deceased , of numbing oneself in excessive , meaningless sex . I would have welcomed the viewpoints of family members in depth , as the movie did spend some time to set up those characters , only to have relegated them with sideshow treatment , nothing more than caricatures from parents who try to engage their child's friends in order to discover hidden secrets unknown to them , to siblings who hang around trying to come to grips with the loss , only to find some questionable , eyebrow raising antics leading to assumptions and quick conclusions . As a musical , the songs did feel a little out of place when the characters start to break into them , and seriously , I thought the lyrics could have been lost in translation , as sometimes I could not see how they either move the narrative forward , or speak from the heart the innermost thoughts from the characters mouthing those words . At some points it really felt a little bit forced , and have left one wondering about the relevance of those phrases sung , so while the meaning have probably been lost in me , it might be of relevance to French speakers . While the movie stars Louis Garrel , Ludivine Sagnier and Clotilde Hesme , the bulk of the screen time belonged to Garrel's Ismael . The threesome relationship between their characters weren't exactly explained , only that they are strange bedfellows sharing their nights together . While Sagnier's Julie did reveal her uneasiness at such an arrangement , Hesme's Alice already knows of the boundaries within their relationships that she cannot cross , and as they toy around those forbidden lines , any sense of angst and unhappiness get sung away quite fleetingly . In short , it's a film that lacked some crucial emotional punch , preferring to just scratch the surface and try to get away with it . Definitely trying to appeal to the niche crowd with its dalliances with hetero / lesbian / gay themes , but ultimately , came across as very forced and pretentious , trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole , if you can pardon the pun . Disappointing stuff .
514827	317399	454970	4.0	A Nutshell Review : Turistas	Turistas is a clear cut Hostel wannabe . The similarities are obvious , with a group of backpacking tourists having the time of their lives , only to have their vacation cut short after taking advice from outsiders , and find themselves in compromising situations which threaten their lives . It's a race against their aggressors as they try and escape . . . doesn't it all sound so familiar ? The slasher genre cannot be more overcrowded than now . With franchises such as Saw and movies like Hills Have Eyes , Hostel , Wolf Creek and son on , we brace ourselves for more , with the sequels of the previous two mentioned movies coming out soon . I guess such movies , filled with sex and violence , will continue to be made until the box office start to show signs of severe dents and become unprofitable , and hey , I'm not complaining , until now . While you have to tip your hat off at the attempt at tying in urban legends ( which could be true ) about missing personnel and the sweeping statements made at organ donation , the execution ( pardon the pun ) of this movie , is nothing short of basic formula - sex and nudity at the beginning ( though nothing much to see ) , followed by plenty of blood , gore and violence to end it all . In fact , the build up takes so long , you wonder if they had forgotten all about the need to put the characters under some form of duress and emergency , remembering to do so only in the last 30 minutes of the film . Even then , this movie is a walk in the park compared to its more gruesome counterparts . Boasting only one major gory scene which will be likely to make your stomach churn , everything else is a long stroll to making things happen . In fact , having a director of underwater photography credited in the opening , is warning enough - there is a severe overindulgence of underwater scenes , which is neither interesting or exciting , and dragged on for too long . With its inadequate lighting and repetitive actions of surfacing for water , this is perhaps candidate for worst non-action-sequence-ever . If you must scratch your itch in watching a gory movie , then hang on to those precious dollars until The Hills Have Eyes Again . Unless you're a fan of the Las Vegas television series , then you might want to check out one of the rare big screen outings of Josh Duhamel ( who plays Danny in the series ) . Otherwise , wait until Michael Bay's Transformers hit the big screen , he's in that one too .
514685	317399	81165	4.0	A Nutshell Review : The Mystery of Oberwald	The Mystery of Oberwald is a made of television movie , done in video before being transferred to 35mm . As introduced by Lorenzo Codelli , this movie reunites actress Monica Vitti and director Michelangelo Antonioni since their last collaboration in Red Desert , some 17 years earlier . During this while , Vitti became a fairly successful comedic actress , while Antonioni was like a globetrotter having films made in the UK ( Blowup ) , US ( Zabriskie Point ) and having a documentary done in China about China on the invitation of the Chinese government of the time . The movie was shot for state broadcast television , which was appealing to filmmakers at that time because it was increasingly difficult to raise funds for theatrical feature films . And if Antonioni wanted to make a film to dabble with video technology , then perhaps he had achieved that goal . Technically it had employed many tricks of the trade through its cinematography and editing , but what strikes you most is the use of colours in the movie to accentuate mood of its characters , through various changes and transitions , with contrasting hues and tints used which dissolves every now and then . When used at the great outdoors , the generous shots of nature were given a life of its own , and in those terms , makes it a very beautiful film to gawk at . If only the story could match up to its technical strengths . Based on the play " L'Aigle a Deux Tetes " by Jean Cocteau , it's no wonder that the movie played out exactly like a stage play . To make things worse , the dialogue was excruciatingly painful to sit through , perhaps being a period piece , we have to make do with characters speaking in more elaborate terms and beating around the bush . It could be another case of having its nuances lost in translation , but if that's the case , then the subtitles really did the story no favour . The situations the story unfolded were rather unconvincing , and quite dry . Unfortunately too that Monica Vitti wasn't able to arrest you with the special x-factor that she possessed in the earlier Antonioni movies , and looked rather tired in her role as The Queen , who has rather queer habits . The story picked up early when a pursued Sebastian ( Franco Branciaroli ) ended up breaking into the castle at Oberwald to perform an assassination of the Queen , only to have fainted before carrying out his mission . The only saving grace for him , is his resemblance to the late King , and herein lies his ticket to get out with the Queen still nursing a longing , and takes a natural liking for Sebastian . In between an unlikely , unrealistic and unconvincing romance is thick politicking between the Queen and her enemies , chiefly the Archduchess whom we never see on screen . There's much talk about fate and destiny and the likes , but that's only when you can tolerate and get through Act One which happens to be mostly a monologue where the Queen rants to an unconscious Sebastian . Certainly The Mystery of Oberwald in my opinion is not one of Antonioni's best , nor does it come close to being something quite memorable . This movie currently ranks as my least favourite of all the Antonioni movies watched to date , and elevates my other Antonioni disappointments as masterpieces to be celebrated .
515426	317399	1264107	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Pulau Hantu	While this might have been marketed as a horror film , the end result is nothing but , given its distinct lack of scares . I suppose local horror movies with military flavour ( such as 1942 ) tend to be focusing on the military aspects of the story and even on the relationships between soldiers of a platoon , rather than on the supernatural elements . Pulau Hantu did try to stick to some formula with attempts at cheap scary shots , which because of the amateurish technique , failed to raise goosebumps or elicit worthwhile screams . Maybe that's why this also didn't opt for a commercial distribution ? Besides Army Daze , I think this is the only other local feature film that doesn't seem to quite put the Singapore Armed Forces in good light . With the former , it's understood that the characters were designed for comedic effect , and the setting being the first three months of conscription , does provide for some natural opportunities for humour . With the platoon in Pulau Hantu , these are reservists who form the backbone , but alas they seem to be more like complaining schoolboys ( minus the girl of course , who's a career soldier here ) , which to a certain degree , does seem to be quite a close fit to real life . And putting the horror element aside , it dwells a bit on the dynamics within the platoon however , with a white horse LTA Heng ( Carl Ng ) leading the team , much against his own wishes for coming back to serve out his obligation to the country , and is assisted by a female MSG June Fong ( Pamelyn Chee ) . Rounding up their group are a number of CPLs Alvin ( Shane Mardjuki ) , Rajah ( Vijay Madhavan ) , Hadi ( Sani Hussein ) who seemed the only one aware of the deep trouble they're going into , and the Hokkien soldier PTE ( yeah ) Frankie Low , played by John Cheng , providing plenty of comic relief in the first 20 minutes of the show . As mentioned , the " white horse " element got quite a bit of attention and comparison here , as do other little gripes about wearing green . The film opens in quite standard terms with establishing the source of the supernatural , with a village bomoh ( witch doctor ) raping a woman he fancies , and the product of that event was a child . Soon both mother and child get buried alive , and sets up the background for the spirits that haunt the island . We then see Adrian Pang cameo as MAJ Damian Lee at the Detention Barracks , interrogating an unseen somebody to recount the events that are about to unfold , for investigations , and thus sets up a little bit of mystery just who this person might just be . So it's a story about a platoon being recalled to serve their reservist by looking for 3 AWOL soldiers on the island of Pulau Hantu , before realizing that their enemy might be of the unseen variety . The premise had plenty of potential to make this one mean horror flick , with its veins reminiscent of Singapore's cinematic heydays with the likes of horror films such as Pontianak . Witch doctors , victimized damsels , and nicely set up twists to surprise the audience , but alas , its execution came through as a little bit clumsy , and unfortunately , seemed caught up at wanting to play at soldiers rather than to serve up something that could even be remotely spooky . Granted that this is PG rated and funded by MDA so there might be certain territory that the film can't venture too much into , but this could serve as a stifling point in reining back something that could have gone to greater heights . For instance , this much be one of the most polite bunch of soldiers I've come across in a while , and does Singapore proud by speaking good English even at the face of adversity . And while tactical route march is the order of the day , certainly we can cut down on the number of instances where soldiers walking around in high port pattern , since , well , nothing exactly happens . Lighting is also an issue , though I understand that it could be digitally enhanced to spruce up the darkened skies and the likes , but this in effect negated a number of scary moments where the audience frankly couldn't see a thing , when it should have mattered and raised some goose bumps . Also , certain scenes came across quite jarringly due to poor editing ( the sudden immolation scene anyone ? ) , though credit is to be given for working around a tight budget , such as the creative thought into dealing with grenades that cannot be exploded . It tried to be a Guard Post , but of course minus the blood and gore ( it's not a slasher flick ) , but could have incorporated many basic techniques to serve us some serious scares that audiences would still be left shaken even when the lights come on . We have no lack of ghost stories , as mentioned sarcastically in the movie , that is set in the army , such as a stuck in development-hell production called Charlie Company , but what needs to be really improved , is the way those stories get told and transferred to celluloid . For once I say let rip those cheap scare tactics to see how far one can go in getting audiences spooked .
514823	317399	768212	5.0	A Nutshell Review : The Last Mimzy	Directed by the current CEO of New Line Cinema , The Last Mimzy is a children's fantasy movie which goes along the grains of having its children protagonists developing special powers , communicating with one another and with an alien object that no adult ( or anyone else for that matter ) can , and to help save some futuristic civilization . Sounds like a typical walk in the park for any children's movie you might add . The Wilder siblings Noah ( Chris O'Neil ) and Emma ( Rhiannon Leigh Wryn ) find a mysterious box with strange markings , containing some weird toys , amongst which includes a harmless looking soft toy bunny christened Mimzy . Soon enough Noah starts developing intellectual prowess bordering on genius and like Peter Parker would do without eyeglasses , while Emma , with Mimzy clutched closely to chest , starts to exhibit powers that a psychic would , in addition to being able to play five stones that float and with a light show included . As parents and adults ( Noah's schoolteacher and his wife ) , they have a natural tendency for disbelief and to second guess the children , as all adults would in a made for children's movie . And the authorities are hunting for them , just as they would , as targets of a resulting city wide blackout . If anything , the chemistry between the child actors playing the siblings is believable enough , and you would agree with me that Rhiannon Leigh Wryn is adorable as the kid sister whose innocence and love play a crucial role in the movie's plot . There are a few moments with injected humour , which I thought Asian audiences would identify with immediately with Kathryn Hahn's role as a " numbers " obsessed lady , and for technical geeks , watch out for that logo ( I've actually had a friend who was expecting it to pop out , and to our surprise , it did ! ) Expect the rudimentary plot development , characters as well as special effects that are just functional rather than to wow . It should serve as pretty interesting for a kid , but for an adult , we would have already seen other more superior stories , beginning with Spielberg's ET .
515295	317399	84881	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Space Pirate Captain Harlock : Arcadia of My Youth ( Waga Seishun No Arukyadia )	The second movie for the festival is another anime , albeit an older one , belonging to the 80s . I vaguely remember watching the series on television as I recall the familiarity of the pirate motif spaceship . But maybe I remembered wrong , as there are plenty of such space aged cartoons in those days , like Macross , Gundam , and the likes . The introduction already put me off , with a really repetitive Phantom Harlock flying his red biplane and monotonous introduction of his name , over and over again . The plot takes some getting used to , with the bombastic names as we follow this rogue pilot / pirate in his quest to duel with Commander Zeda of the Illmidus alien race . Watching this early 80s animation brings about the obvious comparisons and observation of how advanced animated movies have become . It's obviously 2-D drawings here , and plenty of details which were not possible to be included . Things like background characters having continuity presence issues ( varying numbers amongst a crowd in a constant setting ) , and objects appearing and disappearing for the same reason that drawing by hand , takes up time , and yet draws attention to themselves . And having to draw many , well , sometimes animators do become lazy . This is most unlike today's computer generated graphics where crowd and objects are rendered with a click of the button , and possibly given some artificial intelligence along the way so that they can seem to " act " independently . Space battles have become a dime a dozen , and watching this film today , sadly , the battles are not as exciting as it should have been , with its numerous laser cannon scenes . Some scenes were repeated by showing stock clips over and over again , and brings back fond memories of how , as a kid , you tend to see past these shortcomings , and enjoy the animation for what it is . In today's standards , this will be judged more like stemming from the indifference from the animators , and the lack of pride and professionalism . The characters here are typical of Japanese anime , with weird coloured hairdos , and quite surprisingly , this movie loads up on the melodramatics and exaggerated dialogue . Compared with anime of today , there has been vast improvement in story pacing , setting , and character design . While there were families and kids watching Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children , and this one , it wasn't unexpected that this anime too had its fair share of walk outs , probably because of the hard-to-grasp storyline for toddlers , or the insane need to read subtitles and then explaining to the kids what some of the imaginary words meant . P . S . somehow the screening was marred by the speakers set to maximum volume . The dialogue and musical fanfare just got drilled through your ears into your head and probably gave everyone a splitting headache watching it . The first boo-boo for the festival , and I really hope it's the last .
515083	317399	1082868	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Quarantine	Call it a case of deliberately engineered deja-vu , that I consciously decided to sit through this American remake of the recently screened Spanish horror film REC . Well of course the purpose is to discover if what's essentially the same story and technique employed , could get screwed up in a remake , given that Hollywood more often than not , lets down the original brilliance which they think they can replicate easily to translate to box office dollars . So what's the verdict ? If you've already watched REC , then this one just simply pales in comparison , because of the need to be verbatim , and somehow the filmmakers here found it necessary to tell you every now and then , that there's actually someone behind the camera . Scott the cameraman ( Steve Harris ) appears quite often in front of the camera , well , and actually does so from the onset . Also , to up the body count quotient , new characters were included ( although supporting ones ) , and unlike the original which had an opening scene dedicated to the fire station filled with more meat , here it drones on and on at how the assigned firemen are getting the hots for reporter Angela Vidal ( Jennifer Carpenter ) . The storyline's almost the same , save for a few more extra scenes included to jazz up the gore department , and to incorporate some additional action elements . Otherwise , there's plenty of overacting here by everyone , so much so that instead of rooting for the characters to get out of their predicament , you're more likely to find yourself wishing that they meet their demise soon enough . Such is the original essence lost , and with that , what primarily works in REC . Between the two Angela Vidals , I'd confess that Jennifer Carpenter can't hold a candle to Manuela Velasco . The latter's the sweet damsel you'll risk life and limb to save , whereas the former , well , you'd just wish that she shuts the hell up and stop barking orders . I guess the direction of John Erick Dowdle will have take responsibility for that not-too-subtle difference between the Vidals . And through this film I'd learnt to appreciate how the shaky-cam was used to great effect in REC , and how easy it is to lapse into pitfalls as in Quarantine . Same storyline and plot development , same technique , relatively the same type of characters , but totally different outcomes in terms of how it engages the audience , because there were crucial moments where it failed to understand the need for restraint . Sure you can't expect rocket science to be coming out of this film , but unfortunately it joins the pile of " remakes that don't make it " . Word is REC2 is currently in production , so I'll be looking forward to that , and hoping that there won't be a Quarantine 2 to embarrass itself .
515063	317399	66601	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Zabriskie Point	I've got to admit I continue to be perplexed at the films of Michelangelo Antonioni , having the counter now reach 2 . Perhaps it's due to my limited knowledge of the vast issues during the 1960s counter-culture era , and probably count The Graduate as one of the movies set during the time that stuck vividly on my Teflon coated memory . Between Blow Up and Zabriskie Point , I thought I saw a style continue in having scenes come up in a rather haphazard manner without any seeming logic to connect one to the other . We're presented with something , and then we're left to our own devices to figure out and fill in the blanks . Just like how Daria ( Daria Halprin ) was introduced as a stand-in secretary wanting to access the rooftop of Sunny Dunes Development Company to retrieve a book left behind , before having to ask the approval of a manager . So , was there really a book , and did that chance meeting progress into anything more substantial ? I can only guess . Zabriskie Point began with a closed door debate on revolution , where geeky students were championing their various individual thoughts on what it means to be a revolutionary , some fighting with ideals , while others suggesting violence . It's a somewhat long scene where the camera adopts jarring motions as if you're caught right in the middle of the verbal crossfire , peering over heads and shoulders to look at ( and sometimes fail to see ) whoever's talking . The other protagonist , Mark ( Mark Frechette ) gets introduced toward the end of the discussion where he disagrees with the majority , and walks out . Throughout the first half of the movie we follow Mark as he evades the authorities , presented here as very heavy-handed , and daft too , and we see this very carefree rebel almost synonymously generalized with the impetuous youth of the time . Little is known of him at this stage besides watching him getting entangled in a protest riot ( which was quite documentary like ) that went awry . We assume that he is quite well to do since he obviously have taken lessons to fly a plane , and fly one expertly at low altitudes too . And then the ridiculous and the boring happened , which was an elaborate courtship ritual over land and air , and it's not since Tom Cruise tried to woo Thandie Newton in John Woo's MI : 2 using the crashing , twirling sports car technique that this goes into my books as quite laughable . I would have imagined that the story would pick up at this point where the two youths meet , but of course I was wrong . I am now starting to believe that if it's something that I would have come to expect , then an Antonioni film this would not be . One had been trying to look for direction to the next stage of her character , while the other was running away and wanted to be left alone in peace . Put them together and I wanted to see some sparks fly as they talk , flirt and get intimate . They do , but not without having the entire scene become far more surreal , with plenty of other bodies joining in a frolicking good time at the titular location . And from that point on , I felt the story went downhill , trying to find an avenue to make a last ditch attempt to salvage something out of nothing so far . Sure I can see the obvious references to the anti-war statements , or statements that are anti-establishment , but beyond that , try as hard as I can given my limited ability , I just can't figure out what else would have been coded in between the lines . Just when I thought there would be a story , the last act dragged out itself and no longer became engaging , save for what some would call the mother of all repeated explosions , making a blatant point across that consumerism , corporations , mass media ( and the list goes on ) can all go to hell . Sorry , but Fight Club deals with that theme in far more interesting ways than this one did . There are still redeeming qualities though , and that's the cinematic images that the movie contains , with plenty of generous shots of vast plains , as well as a view from the top looking down at relatively flat city skylines . And sadly , having read about one of the final shots which never seen the light of day , I thought it would've complemented perfectly the gaudy colours of a hastily and heavily graffiti-ed plane with striking pictures of the male appendage and 2 boobs on its wings , together with echoes of anti-war statements and of bombs . Needless to say I did not really enjoy Zabriskie Point , but curiously enough , there were some shades of local films Lucky 7 and Dreams From the Third World in it with its scenes in the flats and in what I thought looked like a cave with dripping water . I guess to continue to try and enjoy more of Antonioni's works and to prep myself , nothing can come sooner than a documentary about the man himself , to be screened tomorrow morning as part of the Retrospect .
514374	317399	897287	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Blood Brothers	Inspired by John Woo's Bullet in the Head , Blood Brothers ventures into the tried and tested boys in the hood gangland story about honour and comradeship , only to find out that there's a little more to girls , gangs and guns . The movie looks great with beautiful sets , costumes , props , but there was a general sense of being emotionally empty beneath the shiny looking veneer . I always thought the cinematic 1930s Shanghai resembled the Capone era of Chicago , with gangland chiefs ruling the streets , and beautiful molls being the damsels in distress , carving a living out of singing in the dance halls , waiting for their anti-hero in that smart suit and fedora hair , totting a tommy and mowing down opponents without batting an eyelid . Blood Brothers transports us back to the era of the Shanghai Bund , with brothers Gang ( Liu Ye ) , Hu ( Tony Yang ) and best friend Feng ( Daniel Wu ) looking toward the big city for an opportunity to carve a name for themselves . Leaving their village to pursue their dream , little do they know that their friendship will be put under severe tests when greed , power and ambition , or the lack thereof , come into play , and challenge the very notion of blood being thicker than water . However , despite big names in the production , what I found to be primarily lacking , is that you don't feel for the brotherhood and camaraderie between Gang , Hu and Feng , which I thought was extremely crucial if we were to care about what will happen to the trio - a reluctant soul yearning for home , a brawn over brains type muscleman whose ambition knows no bounds , and one who turned to the bottle because he can't live up to expectations . Time is indeed set aside in the beginning as a prompter , but it's a case of too little too late , with the narrative being caught up with bringing the audience to the glitz and glamour of the Paradise nightclub . Here , the blood brothers three get involved with yet another power playing trio - Boss Hong ( Sun Honglei ) , his number one enforcer and brother Mark ( Chang Chen ) , and the moll of the movie , the sultry cabaret singer Lulu ( Shu Qi ) , and as the story unfolds and entangle all our casts together into a web of complex relationships , it is when the plot starts to thicken and get slightly interesting , only again to be exposed for its one - dimensional treatment . Which is a pity , given the potential of how things could have been played out . Even the ironic audacity of having the devilish characters storm into Paradise and unleash hell with guns ablazing , in attempts to reach a crescendo , ended up being a tad too bland . Perhaps the same-old treatment given to familiar themes and scenarios bore little fruit , despite a change in setting and a power cast . You just know what will happen , and they happen like clockwork . And it seemed that Blood Brothers was perpetually plagued by the clumsy romantic angles that don't serve much purpose or to contribute any depth to the characters involved . Despite the weak material , the cast did prove to be charismatic enough to hold your attention throughout , which is a good thing . Shu Qi lends her voice and sings in the movie , Chang Chen broods with a degree of suaveness , Daniel was found to be struggling with Mandarin , Sun Honglei was being really menacing , Tony Yang as the naive follower , and Liu Ye's steely gaze and demeanour will make you think twice should you want to cross his character . There were plenty of close up shots of their facial expressions in Blood Brothers , and this pretty left much of the bea utiful sets and costumes being left unseen . What I found wanting though , was the editing and cinematography . It was quite jarring to see the 180 degree rule broken so obviously , and bringing so much attention to itself . For the first time in many years , I was actually slightly disoriented when watching a scene , when it particularly liked to cross the line and back again , and move back and forth when characters are conversing , or that sudden swing of action brings us to the other side of it all . For once , I would have begged for the camera to stay where it should be , and stay still for that matter . I would love to have loved Blood Brothers for its high production values . However , the way the story is developed , and while trying hard to evoke equal emotions as the material it got inspired by , just left a bad aftertaste that it was trying just too damn hard to please .
515496	317399	382821	6.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Lu Cha ( 2003 )	The first movie I watched starring enigmatic Chinese actor Jiang Wen was during a business trip to KL , catching a show at KLCC before my late afternoon flight . In Warriors of Heaven and Earth , he donned a moustache and beard as the charismatic leader Lieutenant Li , in a movie which had great premise but a lousy story to tell . As for Zhao Wei , unless your head was buried in sand , you wouldn't have missed the era in the late 90s where she was bombarding television sets everywhere in her role as Little Sparrow in My Fair Princess Huan Zhu Ge Ge . So I guess putting them together in a movie made it almost irresistible to not want to pick up this DVD . This was actually a precursor to their Warriors movie where they collaborated again , but in this modern setting , based upon a short story " Adiliya by the River " ( what the heck is Adiliya ? ) by Jin Renshun , they star as a pair of wannabe lovers looking into exploring if they could be together . Sweeping aside the age gap , this movie is one heck of a mindgame . It's frustrating at times as nothing actually happens , and the lead characters just sit around and talk about stuff absolutely not related to anything at all . Well , at least not directly related to what's happening on hand , but telling stories - we're sitting through a story with characters telling stories , fictional ones which doesn't really add depth to plot , or characterization . It's pretty strange stuff . And strange are their characters too , with the only realistic moment is the beginning - if you're looking for a stranger in a cafe , and there are two ladies , who would you approach first , the hot one , or the plain looking one ? Chen Mingliang ( Jiang Wen ) went for the jugular , but it was actually Wu Fang ( Zhao Wei ) who was his blind date . They don't start off well , and continued to bicker . One's become obsessive with her conservatism , while the latter is a serial blind-dater . But there is more than meets the eye to Wu Fang , and herein lies the guesswork to decipher who she actually was , and the motivations behind what she is doing . You can boil it down to PMS , or to the wall being built around her heart , or to just plain old psychosis . Whatever the case is , it's about persistence and the relentless pursuit of who you like , and on the other side , to spice things up with playing coy , hard to get , and being more of a mysterious enigma . Nothing much to take away in less than 90 minutes , except to admire the two lead's ability to act and play off each other , and Christopher Doyle's cinematography ( he makes tea leaves in hot water so sexy ) , which is a bit of a waste in a movie lacking in strength of story . I hate to say this , but the repetitive score is a bit irritating . Code 9 DVD contains zero extras . The sound was quite bad , with plenty of echo , like speaking in a vast enclosed space . The transfer was bearably decent , but the subtitles seemed to look as if it has its bottom thinly shaved off .
514777	317399	956038	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Nights at the Rodanthe	After spending the night at Rodanthe , I would rather revisit the Lake House or Il Mare , whichever version that floats your boat . But this is no time travel romance , but features a beach house that's architecturally pretty , a perfect setting for the lovebirds to roost in , in spite of a looming hurricane threatening to uproot their idyllic property . This is a movie where its lead characters are given second chances with their romantic love life , as we observe how they make the best use of their limited one weekend with each other , finding some fascination in their discovery of the other party , before falling head over heels into the arms of the other . While the story might not be something to shout about , I thought the pairing of Diane Lane and Richard Gere worked wonders because of their chemistry , thus giving this movie an added gravitas , versus having some other unknown bear the weight of a generic story on their shoulders . The narrative also made some time for the characters to deal with their respective demons , and responsibility in the minding of their children . For starters , Gere's Doctor Paul Flanner has to reach out and find out how to reconnect with his estranged son Mark ( James Franco ) , while Lane's Adrienne has to convince her kids Amanda ( Mae Whitman ) and Danny ( Charlie Tahan ) that her not getting back together with their father is something that while personal , had undergone much thought with their well-being always on her mind . Such common ground in their attempts to foster a betteer relationship and bonding with their children , draws both Paul and Adrienne together . I was wondering whether Richard Gere still had that magnetism to attract the teenage female crowd , judging from the numbers that turn out in droves to watch this , or the fact that romantic movies are targeting this demographics altogether . Then I realize , from the squeals of delight , that they'll probably go Richard-who , since the object of their affection was James Franco instead . With whatever little screen time he enjoyed here , you can detect audible fawning overs in sense-surround sound . As with all romances , there are certain rules to abide by in attempts to conform and immortalize characters . It's no different here that there was the inevitable , but what I felt would have made the movie a little more powerful , was Paul's attempt to address the minute possibility for a surgeon that an operation might go wrong . While it was used as a platform for Paul to rethink his approach to life , it certainly could have been a lot better handled rather than being glossed over casually with a sweeping under the carpet approach . Those who need your daily dose of romantic movies or typically safe date movies would find that Nights at Rodanthe would appeal as your choice at the movies this week . Despite the clich√©s used , you have two veterans who could turn it around into relative strength , and pull what would be a bad movie , into something more palatally average .
514947	317399	423977	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Charlie Bartlett	You have Ferris Bueller , and Van Wilder , and now we have Charlie Bartlett ( Anton Yelchin ) . But unlike the other two high school dudes with natural chemistry , Bartlett got to work hard at it , stemmed from his personal issues which manifest itself as a want to get himself catapulted to the top of the popularity charts . Being from a rich household , he finds himself like a fish out of water in a public school after being thrown out of just about every private school out there for his shenanigans . And of course , things don't get any better after a disastrous day at school with the school bully , and giving the first wrong impressions to Principal Gardner ( Robert Downey Jr ) , whom he has to convince later when Bartlett begins to develop affections for Gardner's daughter and fellow schoolmate Susan ( Kat Dennings ) . So beings a power struggle of sorts within the school compound , and for the girl both care about . Some have billed Charlie Bartlett as a Juno follow up , but I would like to beg to differ . Sure , they're both dealing with high school kids who fast talks , but when compared to Juno , Charlie Bartlett would probably get his butt kicked real hard . Not to say that Charlie Bartlett is a bad film , but Juno offered a lot more pizazz , attitude and charm that Bartlett seemed to be lacking . However , there are still enjoyable moments with Bartlett that most school kids who aim to be Mr or Ms Popular , would probably identify with . And the scenes where Charlie becomes Agony Uncle and sets up shop dispensing useful advice , as well as controlled drugs , take the cake in the movie , as he discovers his niche market , and milked them for all it's worth . Anton Yelchin has this very sly demeanour and offers much of a devilish attitude from beneath that wimpy surface , though I can't really say that as Charlie Bartlett it will be his defining role . I look forward to his involvement as Chekov in JJ Abrams ' upcoming reboot of the Star Trek movie though . The soundtrack is unlikely to be memorable ( for a teen movie ! The Horror ! ) though one can take consolation with Hope Davis ' portrayal as Charlie's neurotic mother Marilyn , which did seem like a distant cousin to Annette Benning's role in Running With Scissors . And Robert Downey Jr with a bottle in hand did seem like reliving his past on screen , and I'd bet his Tony Stark in Iron Man , would also seem like a stroll down memory lane for him too . The best parts of the story for his Principal Gardner of course involves his one to one challenges with Bartlett , as do any school principal with their school's # 1 rascal , so there's nothing new though to offer there . I had expected a lot from Charlie Bartlett , and we all know what expectations can do , especially when the movie doesn't seem to hit the mark set . Enjoyable , but not the greatest we've seen in the shenanigans department .
515191	317399	492650	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Art of Seduction	Truth be told , if I were to come across Son Ye-jin's Han Ji-wan character , with those bambi eyes and pretty face , I would go jelly too . But that'a about it . I guess I pretty much ruled myself out of the dating scene , for the time being at least , to fall for her manipulative charms . Perhaps it's true that a pretty face can turn a monster into a mouse , and boy , does Son Ye-jin turn heads . She plays a " player / swinger " Han Ji-wan , a private banker who uses her good looks to win customer confidence , or uses it to seduce any man she fancies , for whatever multiple reasons . If anything , players / swingers are quite insecure folks , despite the confidence they project on the exterior . Audiences might have noticed her playing opposite Korean heartthrob Bae Yong-jun in April Snow , where her character was mostly calm , composed , demure , quiet . Here , she goes to the opposite end of the spectrum , with her gregarious , scheming nature in full contrast with the former character's . She also seemed to have slimmed down a bit from her chubbier April Snow outing , but yeah , nobody's complaining ; - P Playing the alpha-male seducer , her counterpart / rival / mark , is actor Song Il-guk . As a good looking architect , Seo Min-jun is a chip off his father's playboy ways . Like Ji-wan , he too is able to turn on his charms to snag the woman he desires , and when he's tired of it all , after reaching his goal , he brings them to a setup fortune teller , using Fate as an excuse that things will not work out . So The Art of Seduction presents to you , the tricks both sexes use on their prey . And it turns up the heat , when the two players meet . Here's where the usual tricks don't seem to work , especially when used on experienced , first-rate players who have worked the ground using similar tactics , and counter-tactics . The narrative was played out rather ordinarily , with one side being presented a scenario created by the other , and how they wriggle out from , then the tables are turned using a different scenario , and it goes on . And unfortunately , for far too long . It does get to you after a while , as you'll start to feel the length of this 100 minute movie . Some of the tactics used were recycled , like Ji-wan's expensive car accident trick , and Min-jun's cost of cigarette statement . For non-Korean speaking folks , you might get lost during the early sight gags where MCQs in Korean flashed on screen . Thankfully this technique isn't used for the entire movie . Many situations presented in the movie also pushes the envelope of believability - how much would a man go to satisfy the unreasonable / weird demands of a girl ? It's the games people play , and how much do you want to get involved ? And it does seem weird that the men Ji-wan snags ( with her skills ) always turn out to be the ah-peks ( older men have all the fun ? ) while Min-jun does well with better choices ( by better I mean more pleasing to the eye ) . On the whole , the movie is pretty campy fun , despite some scenarios not being reasonably plausible . You get to laugh at the jokes ( some being quite weak though , and can be seen a mile away ) , toilet humour even , but more importantly , depending which way you swing , the eye candy on screen would be satisfying enough to forgive the flaws .
514510	317399	441674	6.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Princess Raccoon ( 2005 )	I guess playing a Japanese character or acting in a Japanese movie doesn't warrant as much an uproar as having to play a Japanese geisha . And of course no prizes to be given out if you can guess why I would want to watch Princess Raccoon in the first place - that Zhang Ziyi is one of the leads in a Japanese movie , has piqued enough interest to pop the DVD into the player . The story is a simple one , which somewhat resembles that of Snow White . King Azuchi ( Mikijiro Hira ) is a terribly vain man , and like Snow White's evil stepmother , cannot stand for his offspring to be more beautiful ( yes ) than himself . So he hatches a plan to get rid of him , first by getting him murdered , failing which exile doesn't seem that bad of an alternative as well . So Prince Amechiyo ( Jo Odagiri ) accidentally journeys to the forbidden grounds at the foot of Mt Kairasu , where he meets with the Raccoon Princess Tanukihime ( Zhang Ziyi ) , and thus it becomes a tale of forbidden love , as he's human , and she's obviously not , and goes through its Romeo and Juliet routines . But as it is , the plot is somewhat meandering and plodding . While its central structure is clear , it tangents off with a number of subplots , and unless you're in a mood for fantastical elements with magic , deities and all in various surreal scenes , you'll find the story going terribly all over the place . There are too many characters here , and most of them the minor ones that just chalk up the number of casts without adding much to the story , and there perhaps to boast the beautiful costumes . What takes the cake here is the gorgeous sets and special effects . For the most parts , watching the movie is like watching a stage play , in that the camera pretty much doesn't try anything fancy , nor break the invisible 180 degree rule . It's as if you're sitting in a theatre , and watching events unfold in pretty much the style of a stage musical built on intricately designed sets , with the multitude of songs and dances . What makes this movie unique is the visual presentation , fusing effortlessly the elements of computer generated graphics with live action ( though some were deliberately cheesy ) , and that forms the primary appeal when watching the movie , which is part musical , part kabuki , part opera , nothing less than a visual spectacle . Zhang Ziyi obviously had her handicap in the movie worked to her advantage . Being a magical raccoon , she speaks in an incomprehensible language ( which is Mandarin ) to the rest of the Japanese folks , while being able to rote learn and spew by heart her lines in songs , given that they're repetitive in nature . Her acting's her a little over the top and exaggerated , perhaps to complement the operatic elements in the movie . Pick this up only if you are a completist in wanting to watch the movies in the filmography of Zhang Ziyi , or love graphics , sets and beautiful visuals . Otherwise the story is likely to bore you to death .
514610	317399	402894	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Casanova	Hollywood has depicted many legendary lovers in one way or another , from Don Juan to Valentino , and this time , Venetian playboy Casanova gets the big screen treatment in the form of Hollywood " It " boy Heath Ledger playing the title role , with much aplomb . Hollywood's Casanova , set in the 18th Century , isn't a very serious film , taking its cues from 90s styled period productions like The Three Muskateers ( which also starred Oliver Platt ) and Man in the Iron Mask ( with ex-Hollywood " It " boy Leonardo DiCaprio ) . Casanova , as we learn , lacks mama's love , as he gets abandoned while she sets off with her unseen lover , but not before she vowed to return , and therefore bringing to our attention that his view of love is probably screwed to begin with . He sees women as conquests , and if Geishas can stop a man in his tracks with just one look , Casanova can bed thousands of women with his sweet nothings , and I mean nothings . Becoming the god of fornication brings about infamy to his name , until he has to salvage it by settling down with the right women , or face the church's wrath . While setting his sights on probably the last virgin in Venice ( yes , the image of Virgin Mary did come on screen ) , he's also attracted by the strong willed Francesca Bruni ( Sienna Miller ) , in a role that personifies feminism . She cross-dresses as a man to get to educational institutions , writes under a pseudonym to express her thoughts on the modern woman , and holds on to the notion on one true love . Alas , she's engaged to a pork lard merchant from Genoa , Paprizzio ( Oliver Platt ) , whose family wealth is much needed to the Bruni family . There are countless of cheese that added plenty of camp to the characters , and stretched was the notion of mistaken identities like a grand Venetian Masquerade , as Casanova schemes his way to get past the Church and women to get to his prize - Franscesca . Certain scenes seemed implausible , like American Pie styled antics in the grand ball , as we see Casanova wriggle his way out of tight situations he puts himself in . But the Catholic Church perhaps got the most flak , like the depiction of horny nuns , dim-witted investigators ( Jeremy Irons sleepwalking through his role as an Inspector Closeau clone ) , and having strange powers like the restoration of a woman's virginity . Corruption too prevails , as the Papal Office seemed eager to strike shady deals in order to further its cause . The movie has its moments , but not enough to carry the entire movie through . It stuck to safe predictable formula to entertain , and offers nothing much in its censored version shown here . Good probably for a boring weekend , and if you want to check Heath out to compare with his role in the other Oscar heavyweight movie .
514516	317399	468871	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Portrait of a Lady Faraway	This movie marks my first Iranian film viewing , thanks for this year's SIFF focus on Arabian cinema . You might be curious as to why I chose this film amongst the selection on offer . Remember Fly By Night 2005 ? Before we came up with The Undecided , we actually considered a short film which resembled the synopsis of this movie . My interest was piqued , and so I bought a ticket . What did I think of it ? Honestly , I thought our short film , if we had done it , would have turned out to be more interesting . No , I'm not being shameless , This movie started off very strongly , given the setting of the premise , but then it degenerated into what I always deem as a cop out - the open ended , was-it-a-dream clich√© . A lonely elderly man , Ahmed , finds that a woman had left her intentions for suicide on his answering machine , together with instructions and an address , and approximate time during which she will end her life . He decides on a whim , and out of curiosity , to seek out this woman . His intentions would be to save her , then again , it was never told . At the address , he doesn't find the woman , but instead found a friend of the woman , and they embark on a journey together to look for the suicide victim . You can get a good glimpse of Iran in their travels , before the movie starts to slow and get bogged down by wondering how to weave all the subplots and end them in a coherent fashion . I'm never a fan of movies which try to take art-house twists and suggest dreams or leaving it too open ended without a hint of a reason . However , the complex visuals make this interesting to watch , and the edgy soundtrack was good enough to hold my attention , despite it being extremely loud so as to vibrate the entire cinema hall .
514787	317399	470801	6.0	A Nutshell Review : I Do , I Do	I first saw Adrian Pang on the big screen when I was still in the army , during one of our nights off where we managed to catch a Singapore movie ( back then , Singapore movies were rare , and not to mention suffers from low attendances because of the misconception that locally made movies are bad ) , and I was tickled by his portrayal as the Ah Beng who aspires to be the king of disco in Forever Fever . Fast forward to today , Adrian is based back in Singapore , and has been a regular on local television , from acting to hosting , and gaining a reputation as a funnyman in addition to Gurmit Singh . In between he has also managed cameos in movies like Spy Game , and it's no surprise that he was picked to star in another movie , this time by Jack Neo in I Do , I Do , opposite top compere and host at that time , Sharon Au . I Do , I Do is a typical Jack Neo movie , tackling topical issues of the day , this time with the worrying trend of single Singaporeans taking too long to get hitched , and to repopulate our numbers . Falling into this category , I recall plenty of noise with regards to this , from the newspapers , to television , to even nagging parents , and it is no doubt that Jack , the commercial film director that he is , would have picked up the buzz and made a romantic comedy out of it . And in typical Jack Neo fashion , you'd come to expect the predictability of recycled criticisms of the government ( which had a scene with Jack as an MP , good for only one thing ) and social commentaries worked into the plot , which is more or less what you hear from coffeeshops . Starting with a one-sided breakup of an infatuation , Liu Wenhui ( Sharon Au ) made it clear to Lee Ah Peng ( Adrian Pang ) that she sees no future in their relationship , given their difference in status and having no " Feelings " for him . The story then tracks Ah Peng's tactics into wooing his lady love back , and along the way , the main obstacle comes in the form of a new ABC colleague Chen Jianfeng ( Allan Wu , current host of the Amazing Race Asia Edition ) . It's predictable stuff , clearly fluffly with implausible plot development , totally losing the plot towards the end , as it plays out as short comedic skits being glued together , some not being funny at all . Typical in a Jack Neo film , you can count on a series of songs being composed for the movie , and used as montages for plot summarization . As always there are scenes set in coffee shops and hawker centers , and dialogue and cameo appearances played just for laughs , like the appearances of " Brother Hui " and Mark Lee , regulars in Neo's troupe , and the Lao Zar Bo also seen from Neo's latest 2007 movie Just Follow Law . But for a lacklustre movie with its key message focused on not giving up the forest for a flower , it's compensated for its revelatory scene at the end , after you have to course through clich√© after clich√© in its storyline . The nifty special effects were a treat too , though it does also get cheesy at times when coupled with song and dance . The Code 3 DVD from Scorpio East contains decent audio and visual transfers , which does not offer you any choice of formants or languages . You only have a scene selection from 8 chapters , as well as subtitles available in either English or Chinese . It's relatively bare bones , and I'm not sure why to date locally pressed DVDs still call standard fares like the inclusion of theatrical trailers and useless photo stills " Special Features " . Just so you know , the trailer runs 2mins 10s , and the photo gallery contains 20 stills . Hardly what I call special .
515207	317399	449467	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Babel	If my memory serves me well , my knowledge of The Towel of Babel is from the Bible , where it was said that men at one time were speaking one common language , and aspired to build a tower so high that it would reach the Heavens . For some reason , God decided to pour cold water on the massive project , by dispersing everyone on Earth to far corners , and have us humans speak multiple languages , so that overnight , we couldn't understand one another , and therefore , the Tower project had to be abandoned . Babel just triumphed at this year's Golden Globes by walking away with the Best Drama award , which The Departed was touted to win , but I guess having a movie which is a remake win the award , is akin to saying " Infernal Affairs , you guys can trounce our multi-million dollar epics anytime " . Babel follows a similar formula to other acclaimed movies such as Crash and Syriana , which take on a multiple angle , multiple story , with multiple intertwined characters all running along in the fragmented narrative , with the story arcs all linked to a common theme . With Crash and Syriana , the themes were clear and simple . With Babel however , it lived up to its issue of communications . In a bad way that is . Babel probably wanted to be bringing across the message of the importance of communication , and miscommunication , but it turned out to live the message of the latter instead . Perhaps it wanted to elevate itself more into a thinking man's movie , but really , it's much ado about nothing . For movies which relied on narrative gimmicks such as this , it belongs to the same category as my previous movie review for Haven . Entertaining wannabe , but not quite there yet . Written and directed by the same team who did 21 Grams ( director Alenjandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga , which probably explains why thanks went out to Naomi Watts and Sean Penn ) , it's not all that bad , but you rue at its missed opportunities to really become something great . There are four arcs here - the first being a Moroccan farmer and his children , the second an American couple in a life-and-death crisis , the third a Mexican housekeeper and the children of her employers , and lastly , a look into a Japanese deaf mute's relationships with people around her , which probably is the one with the least relations with the others , but had the most potential in bringing out the theme . In all the stories , you see the attempts at communication , or lack thereof due to language , but you notice many a times , that language itself serves not as a barrier so long as the willingness to address another person is there . The American couple ( possibly the big name stars in the movie - Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett ) with zero language barriers , yet faced with insurmountable difficulties in understanding each other , or in the deaf mute's case , the constant brushing away of parental concern , and of course , the inherent difficulty in not being able to speak or hear another person . In fact , in all these stories , it's more about the cry for help , in various sense . The Moroccan farmer sensing futility in the heavy handedness of the law , the American couple literally begging for help in a land in which they do not speak the language , and in their ill attitudes of blaming everyone else , of the Mexican housekeeper getting her charges stuck in a nightmare situation , contradicting her many years of faithful service , and of course , the Japanese arc , the deaf mute undergoing peer pressure in getting laid , and we question the reasons for her sexual promiscuity . And I couldn't help it but laugh at the various televised news reports in the movie , that the media is always quick to jump to conclusions , and in doing so , helps nobody at all . There are familiar actors in the movie , but don't go expecting any to pick up any awards anytime soon , as their roles do not offer them a chance to shine , especially not in a crowded ensemble like this with little room for much character development . Keen eyed viewers might recognized Gael Garcia Bernal from another movie now showing - The King , and Dakota Fanning fans will get a chance to see her sister Elle Fanning in action , albeit in a very small role , most of the time asleep . What could have set tongues wagging would be Rinko Kikuchi's role which required full frontal nudity and Sharon Stone-ish moments , but really , there's nothing much to it . My verdict is that Babel is overrated , belonging to that cross narrative wannabe style of storytelling , with actually a very simple story to tell , let down by delivery , traded off for style instead . Don't expect too much from it .
515139	317399	1194624	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Sniper	If not for the picture scandal , this film would have been released about a year ago , and would likely have solidified Edison Chen's position as box office draw given his stellar performance in crime-action flicks like Dog Eat Dog and Blood Brothers , and pop idol fare such as Initial D . But we know what had happened over the span of a year , though I suppose the decision to hold this film back would have helped it in increasing the curiosity surrounding this , given his last / first performance since the scandal . After all , the producers have to make the best out of the situation . His character in Sniper is a typical Edison Chen persona ? young , brash and impatient , toeing the line of the good and possessing that streak of arrogance . As OJ , he aspires to be the top shooter amongst the SDU Sniper Unit , and is mentored by the team leader Hartman ( Richie Jen , who also starred as a sharpshooter in Johnnie To's Exiled ) who discovered him during a mission , and is impressed by the upstart . Given the attributes of a sniper ? confidence , decisiveness and ruthlessly accurate , egos are swelled and clashes are part of the game , where while it's a team effort , you can't deny those strong individual desire to excel above the rest . The unfinished business of the earlier generation comes back to haunt the team in the form of the disgraced , and once top shooter Lincoln ( Huang Xiaoming ) , who in a rash , negligent act gets sentenced to imprisonment , and upon release swears revenge on his once buddies . For a moment there was a tussle for the apprentice ala Star Wars style , where the young one found his training under his mentor too stifling and never appreciative of his abilities , and on the other , darker side , becomes seduced by sexier techniques which seem to be the path toward instant results and glory . But alas the story unfortunately becomes quite fluffy , with the dramatic moments just excuses to string the action sequences together . The runtime under 90 minutes also provided a feeling that the film has been super summarized , given a lot of sub plots being introduced briefly , but never really reaching second base , especially with the relationships of the snipers and the opposite sex . You would wonder why they had even bothered to devote time to this aspect , just to know that the crazed nut Lincoln is terribly infatuated with his girlfriend , OJ's girlfriend is a one scene wonder , and Hartman's estranged wife lies comatose most of the time , waking only to shed tears and raise her voice . I guess in a sniper's life , the only " wife " they take care of , as in the prologue , is their rifles , to protect it with their life or professionally , they're screwed . Dante Lam's star has been shining rather brightly , and I have enjoyed his recent effort in Beast Stalker . Here , he crafted some wonderful sniper action scenes without resorting too much on the looking-through-the-scope syndrome , striking a balance in being instructional , yet adequately paced to be tension-filled . What I appreciated is his fusion of that psychological element a sniper brings to the table , of the ability of how one man well hidden , and well trained , can take out a platoon or company , because of that element of fear that is introduced . Too bad for the many cardboard supporting villains and victims though , and that strange need to CG some dark clouds and fake lightning to drape many scenes . Undoubtedly the show belongs to the ensemble cast in oozing machismo as they do battle , but you can't help but to feel that it is Edison who's pulling in the crowds in what could be his last hurrah . In a cruel twist of irony , his character here can't wait to talk to and provide snide remarks to the media , which is a far cry in the real situation he's in now . One can only wonder how things would have turned out if not for that moment of accidental folly .
515329	317399	467197	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Max Payne	For starters , don't be a dweeb and start heading out the door when the end credits roll . If you deem that the movie didn't have proper closure since there are additional folks who didn't get their due Payne justice , then this scene at the end with Mila Kunis playing the Devil's Advocate , will probably make some amends to what is essentially a relatively generic detective drama . My first experience with the Max Payne game was by chance in a cybercafe . Back then , Counter-strike was all the rage , but having been thrown out of a server , I was poking around the computer's desktop , and noticed the game icon . My first impression after surviving all five minutes of it in the subway shootout , was that it allowed anyone who wanted to be Chow Yun-fat in a John Woo movie , play out their fantasy in full slow-motion glory . It was one that spewed plenty of blood , but more gratifying to a gamer , was how varied and massive the firepower was . How did the movie fare ? Well for those looking for the same all-out wall to wall action , you might have to be patient until the hour mark before things really start to heat up . Even then , it takes a lot more set action pieces before you get to the money shots as seen in the trailer . Good thing though that director John Moore didn't go overboard with all the slow motion madness the trailers would have led you to believe . Then again , this made the action stick to the formula of body counts , unlimited rounds , and an almost indestructible hero . Those who are worried that Max Payne will be turned into John Constantine , can put their fears to rest . In fact , most of those winged angels don't serve much purpose in the movie , except to give the visual effects and the computer graphics guys a job to do . It's actually quite unnecessary except to throw up red herrings when you try and figure out what function they serve , and then it will dawn on you that it's for stylistic purposes and not substance . The opening of Max Payne made it look like it plagiarized that from Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity . And in fact , given the look and scowl on Damon in The Bourne Ultimatum's poster , he does look like a doppelganger of Mark Wahlberg , and both of them could probably interchange roles since all that is required , is a permanent scowl . As the character goes , Payne is out kicking down doors looking for the murderer of his wife and child . And this is essentially a one-man show easily dispatching countless of faceless , emotionless and pretty clich√© ( think The Fugitive type ) villains . What I thought could have been frowned upon , especially when the morally right go up in arms to condemn the movie for its violence , would be what seemed like a condonment of drug use , never mind if it was used for survival purposes , because it made it seem like drugs make you tough and fearless . Supporting female characters get turned into your classic flower vases , and I seriously think that newly minted Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko should start to look for more variety in the roles that she plays , rather than the usual vampish Russian who doesn't hesitate in shedding her clothes for the screen and wanting to bed the hero . While she's largely forgettable here , Mila Kunis ' role as Mona Sax would likely be the meatier one , but alas I suspect that most of her scenes got cut and left at the floor of the editing room . It's quite amazing though how a little goth makeup and loads of leather could transform her from friendly hotel front desk staff in Forgetting Sarah Marshall , to a character that has a penchant of popping up with no rhyme or reason . It's far from being a satisfactory game-turned-movie , mostly let down by the wafer thin plot that reeks of having been there and done that . Visually it's very beautiful to look at , with the constant gloomy nights punctuated with first snow . Fans of Wahlberg who are familiar with his bad-ass dude roles , would find that it's the same all over again , no matter if he's called Max Payne , Bob Lee Swagger , Dignam or Bobby Mercer .
515353	317399	48937	6.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Alexander the Great	I borrowed this movie with one intent , and that is to see how the subject material was handled in the 50s , compared to the most recent interpretation by Oliver Stone , who gave us an Alexander with Colin Farrell complete with his hair dyed blonde . And while I was lamenting the fact that there were only 2 war scenes on a massive scale included in that version , the hype that surrounded the story of a conqueror seemed to have made way for Stone's very queer depiction on the bisexuality of Alexander , especially with the camera adopting his POV and gazing ever so lovingly at the male species , countless of times until you want to throw up . I guess subtle is never in Stone's books . Now this version written and directed by Robert Rossen ( who also gave us the original Hustler ) did away with all that sexuality issues , and neither did it find any need to have gratuitous nudity in watching Alexander make love ( in Stone's version , Rosario Dawson went nude in her role as Roxane ) . Then again it was made about 50 years ago . Anyway , what I found to be a major disappointment , were the battle scenes . Yes , it might be terribly dated by now , and sadly didn't survive the test of time . At certain scenes and angles , it's akin to old martial arts movies , where enemies just circle around you , waiting for their choreographed moves to be executed , or worse , if you pay attention to characters in the background , they surely aren't moving like ferocious warriors , choosing instead to mull around ! Also , we only get one major battle sequence in Alexander the Great , which made the foray into India in Stone's Alexander look like bonus material . In fact , this version took some time to establish key characters , and began with Alexander's father King Philip's ( Fredric March ) conquests first , interrupted by the birth of his son , and the prophetic signs under which he was born . It took almost 30 minutes before you see any semblance to a fight , and almost one hour before Richard Burton finally takes over the mantle and seeks out his destiny as one of the greatest known world conquerors of all time . However , the film felt like it was in two arcs , the first which dwells on the internal bickering within Greece with its many factions , and the plotting between mother Olympias ( Danielle Darrieux ) and King Philip , each wanting to win over Alexander's loyalty for their own political purpose . In this version though , which harped on Darrieux's appearance in the credits , I thought she made Angelina Jolie look more formidable in the role . At least Jolie was dripping with evilness and cunning , compared to the more subdued Darrieux . The latter half dealt with Alexander's conquests through Asia , though most of the facts were glossed over . It was too little too late as most of which are told using montage , intertitles and narration , which made it look like a rush job to end it . While Stone's movie had focused a fair bit over Alexander's obsession with being the Son of God and his increasing obsession over himself and his glories , this version again made those themes look superbly examined in Stone's version . However , one thing's for certain , Richard Burton , even with the horribly blond hair which looked like a wig , was indeed a lot more charismatic and believable than Coliln Farrell . And that also meant when Burton was wearing the horrendous full faced helmet so that the stunt guy can take over ! All in all , a pretty decent effort in telling the story of Alexander the Great , however as mentioned , it didn't really stood up to the test of time .
515251	317399	898319	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Just Follow Law	Jack Neo is undoubtedly Singapore's most commercially successful director , having made 10 films ( including this one ) , and almost each time , you'd hear his movies topping the charts and breaking box office records . His films touch the common heartlander chord with his fusion of satire and subtle jabs at topical issues , much akin to his skits during his Comedy Night days , and given a huge fan base built , it's no surprise if local audiences turn up in hordes to lap up his latest offering which set its sights on the civil service . Almost everyone can identify with the frustrations of red tape bureaucracy , that incident of unpleasantness with staff in their less than helpful robotic stick-to-the-rulebook answers , and of course , attempts to shift responsibility and cover their rears . Wait ! Doesn't that sound familiar , like what every other company employee will do as well ? For the first twenty minutes , it's recounting office politics 101 with spot on accuracy , jazzed up by some special effects , as every tactic in the office politic arsenal get brought out to the table . The story is set in a fictitious government body which is tasked to create jobs and encourage skills upgrading . But the fact is that almost everyone in the department needs a serious upgrade and look at themselves . You can spot the inept CEO , the conniving scheming colleagues , the unskilled miscellaneous workers , the bootlickers , and the elite scholars all having a go at each other . And at times when you laugh at their antics , somehow you're wondering if you're laughing at yourselves , especially when you recall incidents you experienced , or characters whom you see in others . While the idea was there , the delivery was somehow let down . It played out quite childishly , and looked more like mini school skits put together in a very choppy manner . You don't fault the number of ideas the story writers have , but rather at their inability to gel them all together into an engaging narrative from start until end . At times you might think you're watching a tele-movie plagued by too many minor characters , each being a one - dimensional mouth piece for the issues they represent . Casting Fann Wong was a coup , as she's one of the top darlings of Caldecott Hill . And one of the appeal in watching the movie , is to see how she junks her glamorous goody-two-shoes image , for a comedic role requiring her to act like a siao char bor ( mad woman ) . And she pulled it off with aplomb , which is what manages to hold the attention of the audience . She burbs , farts , frequently molests herself by grabbing her boobs , walks like a beng , talks like a beng , swears like a beng too . According to reports , her minders got into fits with her role as Tanya Chew the scholar manager , who got her body swapped with Gurmit Singh's Lim Teng Zui , a lowly employee , as it called for her to act against her image . Well , she sure have thrown caution to the wind and it turned out well , but I thought she could have gone further , instead of having to rely on cheap editing tricks . If Fann Wong acting like a man raised interest , the same couldn't be said for Gurmit's role as a woman , as it sure isn't like Mrs Doubtfire or Tootsie . It's relatively muted , and when the pairs on screen together , there is no doubt as to who is the movie star , with Fann giving the veteran comedian a run for his money . Although they have some chemistry together , I thought the story and dialogue sometimes lapsed into the two characters being their correct selves instead of their swapped ones . The other supporting characters are played by the usual faces from television , and are caricatures requiring As mentioned earlier , scenes are usually made out of mini skits which try to be funny in itself , and then glued together with the lazy fade out transitions for the most parts . While there is a resemblance of a main plot , the subplots display meek attempts at comedy , or stick out like a sore thumb trying to shovel its social message down your throats , at times presenting itself awkwardly in out of place scenes . Being a Jack Neo movie , product placement is never far away , and in his latest offering , there are plenty of opportunities for product placement , which are milked to the max , one of which I thought was a mistake in having Fann seen in an advert . Jack too can't help but to put himself in a cameo , and hammering referential jabs in the script at the government ( 66 . 6 % for a test out of 84 , it doesn't come across any clearer than that ) . The production values seem mixed though . Despite being budgeted at more than a million dollars , the look and feel at times seem like a million dollars , and at times , just felt cheap . There are a lot of special effects put into the movie , and that probably took a huge chunk from the budget , as did Fann Wong's paycheck . The effects though were rather surreal which brought out some fantastical feelings about the movie , and were also used as substitutes for obvious stunts or backdrops that proved relatively costly to make . For once , I was of the opinion that the songs in the movie weren't necessary as they failed to elicit or enhance the mood of the scene , and was there a recycling attempt at using one of the songs from an earlier film ? Just Follow Law will do well , given Fann's against-the-grain role , something audiences would not have seen before , and the fact that it's opening this Lunar New Year period . Fans of Fann , and the usual support base of Jack Neo , will definitely make this movie a hit . A pity that it could have been much better .
514592	317399	495824	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Dorm	It was quite uncanny , a group of us were discussing making a movie about ghost stories told in schools . Sure , every school has its fair share of ghouls and goblins , and we'd thought it was interesting to have it done on film . Heck , we were actually in the premises of a school when we started to talk about it at night too . So imagine our surprise that Thailand actually made it first , and screened in local theatres no more than a month after we discussed . Dorm refers to the dormitory of an all boys boarding school . Chatree ( Charlie Trairattana ) gets sent to the school by his parents , against his wishes . I believe almost everyone would be familiar with the feeling of being uprooted from one school to go to another ( be it upon graduation or otherwise ) , where there's a sense of loss somewhat , especially with friends . As with all new schools , the new kid on the block gets treated with suspicion , and he finds it extremely difficult to integrate into the school . It doesn't help that his initial gang of friends harbours thoughts of going all out to scare Chatree with many ghosts stories about the school ( I could've sworn the toilet one was familiar territory , because I encountered something similar before ) , and making matters worst , the teacher ( Jintara Sukphat ) also becomes a key character in one of these stories , hence making Chatree wary . Despite being the social outcast , and a recluse , Chatree befriends another pupil , Wichien ( Sirarath Jianthaworn ) . They become fast friends , but Wichien has a deep dark secret come 6pm everyday , when he disappears . By now , you would've guessed what would happen . Along the way , this movie somehow forgotten that it was supposed to be a horror movie . That , or the marketing folks have gotten it all wrong in promoting this flick . The horror genre is undoubtedly an extremely popular genre in Asia , one that will put folks into cinema seats , and riding on the wave of Shutter's success , it's easy to get caught up in what essential are the few and far between sense of fright that's packed into the trailer . Be warned , halfway through the movie , the horrifying moments get thrown out the window , and Dorm becomes more of a standard fare mystery . Quite a plain one actually , as the narrative gets stuck in cruise control throughout . You'll be able to guess the ending , and plot devices are thrown in only to help the movie proceed to the following scene . But there's a fun element thrown in , which I thought was quite neat . Fans of Hong Kong horror cinema would clearly identify the " Mr Vampire " remake in Dorm , where the students congregate for one of their night movie screenings . It's a deliberate cheesy remake , but I felt this was one of the more powerful scenes that snuck up on you , incorporating the twist revelation so well , I give it the thumbs up . And yes , the twist is revealed midway through the movie in this scene , and thereafter , " horror " gets forgotten . How's the horrifying content earlier in the movie you ask ? It's not all that frightening , again relying on cheap tricks like musical crescendos to make you jump . You don't get to see much , except for shadows , sudden movements and closeups ( hey , if I can survive this , so can you ! ) . If I had a gripe , it would be with Chatree's hair continuity problem . Unless there's a barber in the school who cuts hair as good as he restores them , you'll probably get perturbed by the changes in Chatree's hair length . In the same scene . Talking to the same person . You get the drift . It's rather sloppy film-making , and the continuity person ought to get shot . The special effects department though , gets my thumbs up for its imaginary swimming pool effects . Really cool stuff there . Horror aside , this film essentially similar to like M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense , though it doesn't dwell as deep into the psyche of Chatree and the spirit . It works on another level , along the themes of friendship , sacrifice , forgiveness and closure . I'd recommend it , not as a horror movie , but a coming of age one . P . S . the version shown here rated PG , is the censored version . Not because of anything frightening , but for a sex scene , which I thought was quite pivotal to identify who it was Chatree's father was humping . Edited away , it comes across as " so what's the big deal ? "
515493	317399	57697	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Youth of the Beast	Youth of the Beast is pretty much acclaimed , but I just can't appreciate it very much , partly because it's quite a dated film - the 60s , and the execution reminded me of the old 60s Batman and the Green Hornet series , in its noir crime storyline as well as the use of the ol ' fisticuffs to settle scores . Not that I didn't enjoy it though , but my smile stemmed more from the cheesiness . Of course when watching a film from the past , you got to approach it in the context when it was shown in . And it pretty much gave you a glimpse at old Japan , with its production sets , costumes , and acting style - which is exaggerated . Special effects and stunts were quite low key ( probably groundbreaking for the era ) , with some shots suffering from sudden jump cuts , and looking raw . Certain stunts were found to be wanting , but again , for that era , it's adequately executed , though by today's standards , audiences would be more unforgiving . The violence too didn't let up , and for a Yakuza movie , violence is part and parcel to their lifestyle . There are a number of innovative techniques used , such as the flame from an aerosol can , and the insertion of a blade underneath the fingernail as a torture method to inflict pain . I was surprised too at the raw scratching off upholstery from a sofa set , which seemed quite realistically painful for the actress to perform . Director Seijun Suzuki actually helmed the movie Yumeji ( 1991 ) , from which the theme song is used in Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love . Here , he crafts the movie from a novel by Haruhiko Oyabu , which could have served as inspiration for Lucky Number Slevin in its playing off mob bosses . Here , Jo Mizuno ( Joe Shishido ) infiltrates and joins a gang by forcing his way through to the top , beating up everyone and anyone who dare stands in his way . Impressed , he's given a stint with the gang , and slowly , a mystery begins to unravel as to his motivations and objectives to doing what he does . It plays out rather straightforward , and you would have guessed his intentions pretty earlier on in the movie , but what impressed is how simple it is to style a movie in this manner back in the 60s . Taking seemingly simple everyday locations like nightclubs and cinemas and having shady dealings taking place under a legitimate business front , does seem rather suggestive of how gangsters operate at the time . I'd pretty much recommend this to those who have high cheese tolerance , or fans of the swinging 60s era movies . Nothing much really to shout about . The Criterion DVD comes with an essay insert , the theatrical trailer ( 60s trailers all have those sensational big words covering 90 % of the screen , very nostalgic ) , a 4 " 48 ' interview with director Seijun Suzuki , and a 7 " 56 ' interview with actor Joe Shishido . For a Criteriod DVD , it's pretty much barebones by standards .
514745	317399	82313	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Eijanaika	The opening film of this year's Japanese Film Festival , Shohei Imamura's Eijanaika was a mixed bag , but the opening is one to behold . Very noisy and extremely boisterous and colourful , there's a carnival like atmosphere in visiting the street markets , with its strange and curious looking circus like performers ( see a snake being eaten alive , I kid you not ) , and others like a peep show for dirty old men . Like the noisy nature of the street market , what I found distracting with Eijanaika is its lack of focus . Set during the time just before the Meiji Restoration , with the grip of Shoguns going into decline , and with foreign powers already set foot on the land of the rising sun , it has many facets on the corrupt ways and the power play between warlords , scheming and plotting against each other to gain a foothold of fame and fortune . But anchoring the movie is the theme of love between the characters Genji ( Shigeru Izumiya ) and Ine ( Kaori Momoi ) , though it's a strange love , which only gets weirder once it addresses its issue on jealousy , and embarks on a journey of manipulation , and sacrifice . Genji has spent 6 years in America , and upon arrival in Japan , finds himself like a fish out of water . He looks up his abandoned wife Genji , who is now a top performing showgirl in one of those peep shows , being sold against her wishes to a master , and has to pay off her debt . But this master-performer relationship might be more than meets the eye as Genji finds out , given her reluctance to leave with him and follow a dream of carving out a new life in America . Somehow you'll loathe Ine's character , that slowly and surely you discover that she's quite a loose woman , using her charms and body to exact her wishes . But you doubt her true love for Genji no longer when you witness the amount of crap she has to go through for her man , despite his being unappreciative of the fact initially ( though it's hard of course ) . Living a new life and going out of her comfort zone might be too much for the unskilled Ine , and perchance that's why the spurning of Genji's dream to live abroad , going back to where he came from and had experienced . Like I mentioned , the narrative felt a bit too scattered with many characters and subplots , involving diabolical scheming no less , to give it a easier flow to follow . But appreciated was the fact that Imamura had instilled within the film some physical comedy involving a band of robbers , who after experiencing the success of their first hit , couldn't conceal their addiction for more . The finale reminded me of Paprika , with plenty of song , dance , color and sheer shenanigans , involving mooning and peeing ( this you just gotta see ) , but I thought it lost the plot with its firing on all cylinders on all parts of the target , rather than zooming in on critical areas and grouping the shots .
515019	317399	430912	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Basic Instinct 2	I was still under-aged when the original Basic Instinct made its debut in the local theater's under the relatively new R rating system , but suffice to say many already know of the kinky scenes , especially the infamous crossing and uncrossing of legs sans panties which sealed Sharon Stone's status as a Hollywood femme fatale . It's been 14 years since , and the sequel is just released here . Which makes one wonder why , given the question would anyone still be interested to see an aging body doing her thing again ? It's no wonder that the preview crowd was mainly elderly uncles and aunties , who apparently had a good time dissecting whatever plot there is to this movie , and of the occupational hazards of being a mental doctor if your mental strength is found wanting . Not that it's not entertaining ( I think my week of work work and more work made me easy to please ) , but elements which were associated with the original psycho sex thriller , save for Sharon Stone's returning novelist cum serial killer Catherine Tramell , are gapingly pissing . Gone is the icepick , and the graphic violence and killing . In place is a series of murder scenes which happen almost after the deed . The sex scenes here are so reduced , they're negligible , if compared to the original . And perhaps to balance the lack of sex , this movie migrates to a more mind-numbing psycho-babble flick , since the mind is the greatest sex organ , as Stone's character Tramell , mind-tangos London psychiatrist Dr . Michael Glass ( David Morrissey ) , and detective Roy Washburn ( David Thewlis ) , investigating her for an apparent murder-suicide of famed footballer Kevin Franks , in a cameo played by Stan Collymore , yes , THAT Stan Collymore . All he had to do in his movie debut was to act stone ( pun intended ) and finger Tramell . How hard is that ? In dialogues filled with double entr√©es and sexual innuendos , Tramell basically waltzes through England in her see throughs , having fun running rings around the two male leads , in a carefully crafted game of cat and mouse with Glass . In her psychosis sessions with Glass on her " risk addiction " , there was mention of Nick Curran ( played by Michael Douglas in the first movie ) , but that was just about the link to the original . Basically as the movie wore on , bodies associated with Glass turned out murdered , and naturally Tramell , Glass and even the detective Washburn all become plausible suspects . Being the master manipulator , the audience might even be seduced by her ideas on the plausibility of certain events , and this swung the narrative into varying directions if you'd allow it . If you do , you'll probably give the possibilities the nod , despite some plot holes and an ending tense sense bordering close to absurdity . What's the motivation for the sequel ? One wonders if it's just to revitalize Stone's flagging career by putting her back in one of her more iconic villain roles in cinematic history . Then again , she should have gone back to basics and not stain the original with a relatively lacklustre sequel .
514715	317399	112817	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Dead Man ( 1995 )	Johnny Depp didn't adopt that weird hairdo first as Willy Wonka in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory . He did that bob-hairdo as William Blake , an accountant in this movie . Directed by Jim Jarmusch , who did Coffee and Cigarettes , and Broken Flowers ( starring Bill Murray in a role written for him ) , this is a black-and-white western tale about one man's extraordinary journey starting from the town of Machine . The introduction is queer , with seemingly endless and repetitive shots of Blake on a train from Cleveland to Machine , interspersed by scenes of the train wheels chugging along . He arrives in a strange town and discovered that the job which was waiting for him , had been filled . Lost , he wanders about town and got a one night stand with a lady . Alas , his life goes downhill from that point on , when the lady's ex-boyfriend arrives and a shootout occurs . Pinned with the blame of a double murder , Blake escapes to the wild west , and got rescued by Nobody , a native Indian , who is equally surprised at how Blake survived having a bullet so close to his heart . And still lodged . Hence an uneasy friendship between the two men is forged as they hold off bounty hunters after Blake ( from a bounty of 200 to 2000 dollars ) , but Blake has to put up with Nobody's mumbo-jumbo and quoting of poetry . Indeed , the words of wisdom spewed is simply hilarious at times , as they just don't make sense . It's shot in black and white , and deliberately slow paced , so this might not appeal to everyone . However , the number of stars in this show will probably raise your interest level , like Crispin Glover , John Hurt , Robert Mitchum , Gabriel Byrne , Lance Henrikson , Michael Wincott , Iggy Pop , Billy Bob Thorton , Alfred Molina and Steve Buscemi . But what's beautiful about the film is the awesome soundtrack from the rocksy / folksy guitars riffs of Neil Young . Which without , the movie would just not work . It's pretty violent in some of the shootouts , but nothing is made too outrageous . Keep your ears peeled at the dialogues and conversations too . So if you're a fan of Depp , why not give this movie a watch ?
514475	317399	407304	7.0	A Nutshell Review : War of the Worlds	War of the Worlds marks the second collaboration between 2 of Hollywood's most influential figures , that of director Steven Spielberg and megastar Tom Cruise . In this updated adaptation of H . G . Well's classic , we revisit alien territory already familiar with Spielberg ( with evergreens like Close Encounters of the Third Kind , and E . T . ) , except that this time around , the aliens are not an iota friendly and wastes no time proving its point with its laser beams . Cruise plays Ray , a middle class salaried worker whose ex-wife ( Miranda Otto , in an underused role ) leaves their estranged kids with for the weekend . Being the selfish carefree man that he is , it is no wonder why he doesn't get much respect , especially from his son . Before you can say move on with the melodrama , worldwide lightning phenomenon gets TV coverage , and soon enough , the horror begins , as the well known battle tripods rise from beneath the earth and annihilate everything on site . The special effects are brilliant , and serves as an effective plot device for unspeakable , unexplainable horror . Spielberg teases you with indirect shots of the tripods , from mirrors and reflective surfaces , never letting you see from a first person's perspective for too long , keeping in pace with the initial suspense built . Terrorist attacks were mentioned in conversation , and perhaps this movie also serves as a timely reminder of always being prepared , with emergency equipment , stashes of food , and familiarity with emergency procedures . This film could take the easy way out and focus on the big explosions ala Independence Day , but since that was already done , we get to focus on the smaller picture , that of the survival of the family unit in crisis , and I applaud this approach . Conflicts arise and sometimes solved through unpopular decisions , and that's the way of life . Most times we do not have complete information , and need to make split second life determining decisions . However , the pace slackens toward the end of the movie , and steers us back with reminders that this is after all a summer action blockbuster , with predictable endings , some plot loopholes and worse , rushed explanations . Tom Cruise doesn't get to flash his pearly whites so often here , as we see a transformation from irresponsibility , and in his son's opinion , cowardice , to courageous dad whose children are his first priority . I'd dare say Cruise is in his element here , saving the day ( in a not so direct manner ) . Dakota Fanning shines as Ray's daughter Rachel , bringing forth a sense of vulnerability with her fear of enclosed spaces , and her love for her father and brother . Being the little damsel in distress , who wouldn't want to save her and ensure that she survives this horrible onslaught ? Serves well as a Hollywood summer blockbuster , but not the " most anticipated " for this year as claimed by some .
515104	317399	420555	7.0	A Nutshell Review : How Much Do You Love Me ?	How Much Do You Love Me ? examines that emotion called Love , or what it's perceived to be . Will you make pretend and move in with someone ? Are you loving someone because of his riches ? Or because of his huge wiener or her hot body ? Is it purely lust or love ? And how in the world do fugly people snag all the hot chicks too ? Between money and love , which would you choose ( and taking too long to decide doesn't earn you brownie points ) ? Like Pretty Woman , only with less candy fluff , how can someone fall in love with a whore ? ( Ok , so it might sound politically incorrect , but that's how the movie plays it out ) A regular joe , Francois , falls for a prostitute at a bar . Played by Monica Belluci , Daniela is the obsession of Francois , as he engages her services for 100 , 000 Euros to live with him for a month ( she charges 150 Euros a night , so work out the math ) until he runs out of cash . A balding man who just won the lottery of 4 million Euros and some , he sure knows how to pick up and select his women . Soon after , Francois becomes the envy of everyone ( so is Vincent Cassell , but I digress ) , as friends like his personal doctor advises him to go easy on his escapades because of his weak heart . But in this black comedy , unfortunate events befall upon those who try to keep the couple apart . It's a tad interesting too as the movie plays out the fantasies of these nay - sayers , as they too lust after Daniela in secret . There's a twist to all the madness , and the final revelation will make you go " ahh ! " as the scheme is unveiled to a whacked out near ending sequence ( do I love that sexy dance move ) . However , as do most art movies go , the ending leaves much to be interpreted in many ways . The visuals are beautiful to look at , and no , I'm not just talking about Bellucci here , although I'd rather watch her in action than the other old babe Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct 2 . Blended with a lot of jazz , it has a bluesy feel to it all , punctuating melancholic mood throughout as felt by the characters . And it's the three key characters who keep the storyline interesting . A regular bloke buying his way to a woman's heart . A woman who whores because she wants to ( and probably satisfying her insatiable appetite for sex ) , and her gangster husband Charly ( Gerard Depardieu ) who allows her to do what she wants to , as his interpretation of love is the clich√©d " if you love her set her free . If she returns she's yours " belief . In the end , love is also about respect , and that's the lesson Charly needed to learn . It's plenty talk about love , sex and even orgasms , and the highlight is probably the three way negotiation on the table as Francois and Charly haggle the price over Daniela . Can love be attached with a price ? How much is it worth ? The plenty of ah-peks in the audience will probably have an answer to this question , and no doubt , ensure this movie's longevity in local screens .
514656	317399	281912	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Hock Hiap Leong	The title of Royston Tan's short film refers to a coffeeshop by that name , which has since closed its doors . Like an ode to the shop and its owners / stallholders , memories of the 60s heydays are brought back in a song-and-dance routine which includes the beehives and a-go-go moves . The beginning looked similar to Moveable Feast , with its protagonist taking in the sights and sounds of the aged-old coffeeshop , and laughter abound when he breaks into a song , complete with high pitched girlie voice , kinda like a bollywood movie with numerous male and female dancers going through their paces in the cramped setting . Enjoyable short clip , leaving you wanting more .
515293	317399	116386	7.0	A Nutshell Review : A Class To Remember II : The Learning Circle ( Gakko II )	Gakko II , or The Learning Circle , is not a sequel to Gakko in the strictest sense . While Toshiyuki Nishida returns in this Yoji Yamada directed movie , he is not the same respected teacher that was introduced to us and we fell in love with in the original movie . The school's different too . Here , he plays teacher Ryu , and teaching in the Ryubetsu Handicapped High School , a school for the intellectually and mentally challenged . It's a very different look and feel from the original . While it had fewer key characters to focus on , it didn't mean that the story would be less rich than the first . In fact , in terms of content and depth of the story , this one is a notch better than the first . There are a few plot points running concurrently . Two boys from the school , Yuya ( Hiroshi Kanbe ) and Takashi ( Hidetaka Yoshioka ) , leaving and embarking on a journey of bonding , bringing out the best in each other , and having to fend for themselves while being out in the strange world . There's also a look at a new teacher's inability to handle the highly volatile Yuya ( yes , this kid literally shits and pisses in his pants ) , and of Ryu's road trip in search of our missing students . The first movie had its premise look episodic with its different compartments for different characters , rarely crossing the line between one sub plot to another . Here , this constraint disappears as we venture into the vast outdoors with the characters , and even at one point , up into the air . And something to note , that Toshiyuki Nishida's Ryu isn't the infallible sensei as we would expect him to be ( though I miss his nose picking teacher in the first ) , as he grapples with having to find a solution to handling his family problems , and the difficulty in connecting with his estranged daughter . Oh , and is that Ayumi Hamasaki who opened the film in a less than 5 minute appearance as the daughter Ryu ?
515148	317399	97372	7.0	A Nutshell Review : For All Mankind	Yes , it's strangely surprising that the next DVD I would pop in the player would be NASA related as well . The previous was mission specific , looking back at the Apollo 13 mission , but this documentary by Al Reinert consists of many first hand account as well as rarely seen footage caught by various moon-bound astronauts over the series of successful Apollo missions . And it isn't really surprising that the astronauts all have a film camera with them when they blasted off into space . After all , who better than to record some never seen before visuals , either en route to the way up to outer space , or to the lucky few who got to land on the moon , the view from out there looking back on Earth . They become filmmakers in documenting their lives too living inside a cramped space craft , to bring to us some National Geographic moments of the lunar surface , and plenty of picturesque shots of our planet . Covering the viewpoints of multiple astronauts , most have confessed that it's easy to get distracted by the view from up there . You get to listen to their thought process , and plenty of unseen footage of the surface that while on one hand fascinating , on the other it may be a bit monotonous because frankly , there's nothing up there except miles and miles of rock and dust . You can tell the enthusiasm of all the astronauts as they frolic around in tumbles and falls , thrilled by the gravitational pull , with the nagging fear that should they spring a leak in that suit because of a sharp edge , it'll mean instant goodbyes . If you'd think it's all grim and serious there , then this documentary would change your mind .
514540	317399	386140	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Legend of Zorro	Finally , after 7 years since the last Hollywood Zorro movie hit the big screen , director Martin Campbell is back with his original cast of Antonio Banderas in the title role , and Catherine Zeta Jones as his wife Elena de la Vega . Set 10 years after the last movie , The Legend of Zorro wastes no time in plunging the audience thick into trademarked action pieces that many associate with the Spanish Fox - the acrobatic lunges , flips , swordfights , whip action and horseback riding . It's all familiar territory with the romanticized Old California , now at a crossroads where the state is in decision to join the rest of America . Things have changed for the de la Vega family too , as they have a new addition to the family , a son named Joaquin , who takes on traits of his father , but not knowing his father's secret identity . Naturally , family takes the central theme in this movie . Why do vigilantes wear masks - simply to protect their loved ones as they enroll in the crusade for justice . This film explores the dilemma of the avenger as he struggles to be there for the general public in their hour of need , and the balance of spending enough quality time with his own family . Relationships aren't rosy with husband and wife , and it's no surprise , they bicker again on screen . And when this concealment and protection of identity is compromised , what could be exploited from it ? Plenty of action in this movie to keep Zorro fans happy , and it's a marked improvement from the predecessor too . Zorro moves with guile and swift agility that will raise your eyebrow at the style of his acrobats , befitting his name " the fox " . The use of the whip has increased , and so is the intensity of the swordfights . However , the plot might be a bit of a letdown . It's the usual James Bondish storyline of some Euro-knight baddie in some highly secret underground organization trying to achieve the total destruction of America . One forgot to remind him that he'll need a lot more smarter accomplices in order to fulfill his desire for world domination . With 4 writers credited for the story , it does seem convoluted somewhat to include too many scenes which clocked the movie slightly longer than 2 hours . Some comedy was injected , but those with Tornado seemed a bit contrived ( a horse that smokes and drinks ? Come on . . . ) The pacing too is somewhat erratic , dragging some scenes unnecessarily and introducing subplots that in my opinion , went against the motivation of characters . There's a stab at the high-handed tactics of a certain government agency , and it's like watching a precursor of spy-versus-spy games . The soundtrack seemed to rehash the love them from the earlier movie too , playing it each time Elenor comes on screen , and the camera still soft-focuses her a lot too . But what could have been given longer screen time is the on-screen banter between Banderas and Zeta Jones . That was what made the first film likable and popular , and while this movie had flashes and moments of it , we could have had more . One could have also expected the effects to be seamless given today's technology , and nothing new presented on screen , but while the end result was impressive , there are certain frames that were obviously blue-screened and superimposed . Despite its drawbacks , this is still a worthy Zorro movie , and with the signature shot of Zorro on Tornado hoisting its legs high in the sky in an all-ready posture ready to strike , with sword drawn , all can be forgiven .
514478	317399	301777	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Robot Stories	Robot Stories is an anthology of 4 distinct segments which premiered in the Singapore Fantastic Film Festival this evening , with a common theme of advanced technology or robots taking centerstage . My Robot Baby In the future where career minded couples have no time to conceive and turn to adoption , they will have to go through a " baby trial " period , whereby they will be tasked to take care of a baby-like Tamaguchi robot , which looks similar and beeps just like Star Wars ' Artoo-Deetoo , sans legs . The robot records how it is treated by the couple , and without proper care , feeding and cleaning , once the evaluation period is up , the couple will be deemed unsuitable to adopt a human child . So when career gets in the way of childcare , desperate times calls for desperate measures . While a robot can be hacked and reprogrammed , the same cannot be done for a human child , and critical sacrifices has got to be made . It makes you think if what had been done to outsmart the system is ethical , and reflect upon a statement made by one of the characters early in the film on " never fall in love , never get married , and never have kids " if these sacrifices cannot be made . The Robot Fixer A man is lying comatose on a hospital bed , while a mother clings onto childhood memories of her time with her kid . While waiting for her child to wake up from his coma , she inevitably goes through his stuff , with most of her memories being linked with his robotic toys . While she scours all around town to re-assemble the broken and lost pieces ( in the hope that it will jog his brain waves when she speaks and presents them to him ) , it parallels her determination and never-say-die spirit that her son will one day be able to be with her again . My guess is any son or mother in the audience , will be able to identify with the characters . As a son , I did , and I know that my mom will go through all lengths to wake me up from that deep sleep , with similar methods and determination . A mother's love is always strong . Machine Love Director Greg Pak stars as the protagonist in this segment , a ( probably subtle approval to Apple ) model G9 iPerson , who's able to self-deliver himself to the company he is bought for . This segment perhaps dreams of what the future may hold for Artificial Intelligence - that of never-tiring workers who can work at their desks all day without the need for breaks , always responding eagerly to " you got work " calls and striving to accomplish all assigned tasks in the fastest possible speed . And with AI , this segment inevitably explores the " what ifs " that these lifeforms could have or developed in terms of emotions , and love , as they learn through interactions with humans . Being the perfect worker , it also brings forth fear into humans on things that we don't understand , and the usual name calling / chiding happens . Abuse also follows with female versions of the iPerson , with lecherous males openly fondling and commenting on why the racks ain't being bigger . I shan't finish this segment for you , except to comment that these robots sure know the right buttons to push ! Clay This is , in my opinion , the weakest of the four stories , but the one which has the most potential , and features the most human of emotions , that of love , longing and the anticipation of death . It is an era where the human brain can be mapped onto a computer , so that man can finally beat death , and while the physical person wastes away , the consciousness will forever be alive in an electronic form . The protagonist , however , refuses to use this technology , being a clay-artist , he loathes the thought of designing his craft without feeling or emotions . However , he uses technology to interact with his dead ( ? ) wife , and with the proper plug in , could also get intimate with her . There is nothing new with this technology feature as it was also shown on screen in Tom Cruise's Minority Report . But interwoven into the narrative is a strong sense of his wanting to be back in the arms of his wife again . Do stay for the end credits . There is a slide at the end which states that production started on September 10th 2001 , and the crew lost one of their own in the WTC attacks . Also after the end credits , one of the dancing robots ( featured in the opening credits ) will appear with a message on New York . For those who wish to catch this film , you can do so on Monday where the evening show will be screened at GV Marina .
515071	317399	456912	7.0	A Nutshell Review : A Bittersweet Life	This is a revenge movie , pure and simple . When it comes to this genre , the protagonist usually has some injustice ( loosely used here ) done unto him , and therefore unleashes hell upon those who incurred his wrath , who of course , failed to finish him off in the first place . Sun-woo ( Lee Byung-hun ) is a hotel manager . Or so he seems . On the surface , he's calm , cool and collected . But step out of line , he brings upon his fury without remorse , and without sympathy . His cockiness earns him no admirers , but he gives his utmost loyalty towards his boss , President Kang . He leads a lonely existence without friends , and in his latest mission , strikes a forbidden friendship with his prey that led to his ostracizing from the clan he belongs to . Relying on his personal judgement , in contradiction with his boss's , he consciously interpreted his mission ambiguously , and this led to his downfall . In the mob , as a servant , you do not think , but carry out orders like a faithful dog . Such is his life for seven years , until now . As with revenge films , those who go against you must die , and you soon find yourself up against impossible odds , and with incredible luck . At times the movie stretches its realism to the limit , but for the purpose of good violent fun . The violence is gratuitous - shootings up close , bleeding by the buckets , hand-breaking , fist-fighting , at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson . But thumbs up for the action pieces , which were well choreographed , especially the escape fight scene ( you must learn , never to give a few minutes to a hit-man ) , and the climatic shoot out finale . Poetry in motion some might add , at times shot like John Woo's slow-motion style with classical music in the background . Various bad characters are up for our anti-hero's dispatch , and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible . On the other end of the spectrum , this film also had incredible amounts of silence and non-action , which punctuated between the action sequences well . Sort of like a breather - the calm before the next storm . The relationship element between Sun-woo and Hee-soo ( Shin Min-a ) however was never fully explored . It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman , but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue , this was never brought across in a clear manner , and left open to interpretation . Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters . Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit . Nonetheless , as a revenge movie , this film delivered . But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could , and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast , stylish action and of course , bloody violence .
514464	317399	810827	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Death Note : The Last Name	A warning to all who attempt to watch this without watching the first movie - you'll be lost , totally . It doesn't come with a summary or a montage , and dives right into where the first film left off . You'll probably have plenty of questions , and there is almost zero character introduction . Even the brisk recap of the Death Note capabilities quickly flips by , offering you no time to complete reading what's on screen . So you've been warned . LIght Yagami ( Tatsuya Fujiwara ) now becomes part of the team hunting down Kira , and a reluctant L ( Ken'ichi Matsuyama ) still refuses to drop his assumptions of Light being Kira himself . However , a new Kira emerges , thereby casting doubts on L's theory , and its seems that this new Kira is more powerful than the last . Another battle of wits ensues , but this time , who's playing who , and at what price ? The cast here is basically the same , just that bit characters Misa Amane ( Erika Toda ) and Tota Matsuda ( Sota Aoyama ) get expanded roles here , to balance the strong testosterone flavour seen in the 1st movie ( ok , not quite , since both Light and L are exactly hunks ) , and given that they're beautiful , I sure am not complaining . Their roles as the television celebrity and the news reporter respectively aren't flower vases by design , and are totally involved in the plot , though still pawns in the entire scheme of things . What made the first movie interesting , even though for the most parts it's devoted to setting up the premise , was that there were many bits of surprises and revelations along the way . Here , all the bits and pieces are sacrificed for one major plot , with Sacrifice being the recurrent theme here , and although we learn more of the capabilities and limitations of the Death Note , it lacks the freshness of its predecessor as everything was hinged on that grand central scheme . And being just one scheme , it had the weight on the entire movie hinging on it to make , or break . Also , there were many moments which made it too contrived , and largely dependent on plenty of coincidences and lucky breaks , even up to predicting how others would behave . Compared to the first , it just didn't cut it , and came across as lazy storytelling on the filmmakers ' part . Even though the ending of the first movie was made of predicting what others would do , and involves being ahead many steps of the way , the same technique as presented in the sequel , is far too complex with many determinants hanging in limbo , for it to work as it should . The pacing didn't help , and its dragged out finale was almost laughable , adhering to the tragic villain soliloquy for far too long . However by then , you'll be glad that it's just all over . I suspect if the two movies are watched back to back , it'll be more enjoyable than watching both as standalones . Still , it makes for some good harmless entertainment on lazy afternoons .
514498	317399	474791	7.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) The Maid ( 2005 )	It's not that difficult to understand why The Maid was successful during its run at the local theatres , and have garnered international attention . I did not catch the movie when it premiered in the theatres ( that's another story for another day ) , but one of the many reasons / excuses I had was that the horror genre of late from Asia were usually laughable efforts , with mediocre story lines , sometimes bordering on the ludicrous . Not that The Maid didn't have its fair share , but somehow it was tolerable , and actually tried to tell a decent story , which I enjoyed . While some might say it's influences have come from movies like The Sixth Sense and Ju-on , I thought it was a decent effort for our current generation of directors to have spun a yarn from the horror genre , currently monopolized by the Japanese and the Koreans . Curiosity about the effort locally had me borrowing this DVD , and I shall unabashedly say I'd enjoy every moment of it , though not without some gripes of course . The premise is set entirely during the Lunar Seventh Month , which is the month where the Chinese believe the denizens from Hell are released for their holiday on Earth , where they can roam around , and spook folks who do not observe the rules . Rules like not returning home late , not stepping on offerings , not turning back when someone calls you out , and so on . The Maid , seen through the eyes of domestic worker Rosa Dimano ( the very beautiful Alessandra de Rossi from The Philippines ) , introduces audiences and refreshes those familiar with the strange customs , about the do's and the don'ts . New to Singapore , her employment comes from an elderly couple , the Teos ( television veterans Chen Shu Cheng and Hong Hui Fang ) , who head a Teochew opera troupe . While the Hokkien dialect has made its fair exposure in local cinema thanks to Jack Neo movies , it's refreshing to hear the Teochew language being the lingua franca of choice in the movie . It doesn't take long for Rosa to violate some of the unwritten laws , and therefore , she starts to experience things that go bump in the day and night . Yup , strange things happen in the day as well , which I find peculiar . Anyway , be it in limited lighting , or broad daylight , the cinematography by Lucas Jodoigne was beautiful , and probably added a positive dimension to the overall feel of the movie , as did the art director Daniel Lim . Were there moments of disappointment ? You bet , and the major one is with the spirits themselves . They just stand around doing nothing ! Despite relying on the usual tricks up the sleeves of horror filmmakers , like the passing shadows , musical crescendos , creaking furniture , and close up fast cuts , the technique used never go beyond that , and the spirits just hang around . What gives ? Some editing needed to be tightened as certain scenes were inserted without much thought to narrative flow , and looked a bit out of place as a transitional scene . That said , I'm still of the opinion that Kelvin Tong's The Maid has its niched appeal , and more importantly , cemented his ability to make commercial films that can be enjoyed by the masses . If his Love Story had put me off , The Maid had shown what he is capable of , besides his debut with Eating Air , which I also enjoyed . The visual transfer is decently done , and allows for details to be seen even in scenes with little lighting , rather than becoming all black . The colours were vibrant during the opera scenes , while maintaining the dull atmosphere of the Teo family . English and Mandarin subtitles are available , though for the first 2 minutes of the film where there was a dialect voice-over , somehow the much needed translation explaining some Seventh Month superstition was missed . While subtitling was good , there were some noticeable grammatical errors in the beginning . You're given a choice of either Dolby Digital 2 . 0 or 5 . 1 , so depending on how spooked you want to be when the music by Joe Ng and Alex Oh comes on , you might want to tweak it for that surround sound capability . The Code 3 DVD by Scorpio East comes with the standard offerings like scene selections , and contain special features like the 1min 55s theatrical trailer , as well as the Making Of , with both English and Mandarin subtitles . containing interviews with the principle cast , Kelvin Tong the writer-director , and Daniel Yun , executive producer . Running 22 minutes , there's a decent amount of information revealed on the art direction , and some behind the scenes look during shooting , where I thought a scene showing the cast having a heck of a time dancing during their break , was hilarious .
515237	317399	463985	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Fast and the Furious : Tokyo Drift	The Fast and the Furious franchise relies on the simpleness of 2 factors to attract an audience from boys to men - sexy cars and fast babelicious chicks , topped up with plenty of testosterone and adrenaline in overdrive . Racing cars of all makes , be they the European , American or Asian models , one thing's for sure , the stunt driving team deserves all the credit . The first movie made a huge star out of Vin Diesel , while the rest had relatively smaller shots at glory , from Paul Walker , who returned for the second , to babes like Eva Mendes , Michelle Rodriguez and Devon Aoki . The third installment decided to insert refreshing elements , and set itself in the land of the rising sun . Presumably influenced by the driving technique called drifting , which made it to mainstream consciousness via the Japanese manga Initial D , it's just too bad that the Hong Kong movie by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak , adapted from the manga , got to it first , like almost a year ago . Perhaps if the latest shenanigans of racers from both sides of the Causeway were widely publicized , this film could even be made closer to home ! ( In case you're wondering , the Malaysian police had recently conducted a dragnet rounding up illegal racers on its North South Highway . Flashy cars with raunchy stakes - the winner gets to take home the loser's chick for a night's worth of lurve ) There will be no doubts , comparisons between the East's Initial D , and this one from the West . In my opinion , this one edged out Initial D . There are many aspects in which Tokyo Drift is superior , and naturally having a bigger budget means that the filmmakers can afford to put more cars on showcase , more cars involved in races , and more races in varied locations like a tight car park , on the streets of Tokyo , and as a homage too to the source , they couldn't miss the mountain range . Scenes were for both day and night , unlike Initial D's predominantly night scenes . It's never about the acting , though Tokyo Drift will lose out in terms of having relative rookies helm the show throughout , unlike Initial D's stellar supporting cast of Chapman To , Anthony Wong , to established popular teeny-boppers like Edison Chen and Shawn Yue . But Tokyo Drift did have veterans like Sonny Chiba lend a hand , and the coup was the casting of Keiichi Tsuchiya , the original inspiration for the manga , in a cameo . Taking over the lead role from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is relative newcomer Lucas Black as Sean Boswell , a good for nothing troublemaker with the inborn need to speed . He comes from a broken home , and is the root cause of his and his mom's moving from city to city , because he cannot get out of trouble from the law . When the final straw broke the camel's back , he gets sent reluctantly to live with his father in Tokyo . Thinking that the Asian city has nothing to offer , before you can say " drift " , he finds himself drawn into the world of underground racing , with plenty of flashy cars , hot chicks and mean Yakuza-linked punks itching to challenge anyone to a race . As clich√©s rule over this movie , Sean falls for the Drift King's ( Brian Tee ) main squeeze Neela ( Nathalie Kelly , thought she looked like a cross between Paula Abdul and Rosario Dawson ) , while unwittingly got brought under the wings of Han ( Sung Kang ) , business partner of Drift King , who teaches him the true meaning and purpose of drifting ( which is a no-brainer purpose of snagging hot chicks ) . Anyway , to a gaijin , Sean is ignorance personified , from culture to racing , he takes these challenges head on , stupidly . And surprise ! A movie like this offered some one-dimensional character development of troublemaker turned good , who learns the meaning of brotherhood , although fame did get into the way of course . But herein lies another strength against Initial D , the lead did not turn out to be " all powerful " - here he has to learn the basics of drifting in an incredible short period of time , and turn out well of course , at the expense of expensive tyres , and cars ( always a pain to see them being wrecked ) . Any racer worth his salt must pimp his ride or zhng his car , and this one offered no less . The star attraction in the franchise are the vehicles . From the Nissans to the Mustangs , it seemed that the Mitsubishi Evo will be a mainstay , and the hero always drives one . It's almost a no - brainer to film movies like these , having stunt drivers to do the actual stunt driving , then cut to actors looking as if they're driving , and insert multiple cuts of hands on steering , foot on pedal , looking mean , etc . Instead of just incessantly focusing on drifting , there are the standard zig-zagging car chases , and some usage of Nitro for that quick boost of horsepower , which the first two movies frequently used . Given its ending by an uncredited cameo which will send fanboys of this franchise into highs , this movie still has potential to be relatively popular and the franchise can indeed continue . It wouldn't be far out if there's an announcement of The Fast and the Furious : North-South Highway , and yes , you heard it here first ! So race away , and unabashedly indulge in this movie that makes no apologies for being fast and furious to the loud sounds of its contemporary soundtrack !
515515	317399	464049	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The History Boys	The History Boys is a highly successful and multi-award winning play from London's West End , and it's probably a no brainer in adapting it for the silver screen to reach out to even more people out there . But instead of being just another adaptation , what probably is rare is that the original cast of the production gets recruited for this effort , together with Alan Bennett as scribe for the screenplay , ensuring legitimacy and authenticity . We follow a group of 8 male students immediately after their A-Level results release , as they get selected to undergo one more special semester of tutoring for their entrance exams to the prestigious universities of Oxford and Cambridge . The charm here lies in the very diverse nature of all the boys , though a common attribute they all have is they're extremely intelligent , with a wicked sense of bawdy humour and wit to boot . In short , your unexpected rascals who know their stuff . But not all 8 get equal screen time though , with more dedicated to alpha-male Dakin ( Dominic Cooper ) , the effeminate Posner ( Samuel Barnett ) and thuggish Rudge ( Russell Tovey ) . They share a special affinity for their General Studies teacher Hector ( Richard Griffiths ) , whose laissez-faire style is thoroughly enjoyed by the boys , and is the kind of teaching class you'll probably come to enjoy too if you're in it . And in a warped way , their cemented ties is one dark secret which if revealed , would enforce certain changes in the class . Enter Irwin ( Stephen Campbell Moore ) , a history graduate whose maverick techniques the boys have to get used to , in order to ace the exams . I find it quite peculiar the way his advice turns out , a stark reminder that hard facts that everyone else knows is never enough . You got to spice it up , be controversial even , if the need calls for it . In short , be something like a spin doctor , spice up reports , essays , interviews , the works . Packaging is key , and that I thought was quite true in how we deal in real life at times . And the styles and techniques of the two teachers come to a clash of sorts , but never too confrontational . It's something like Dead Poet's Society without the carpe diem moments , but presents the kind of admiration and respect that the students have for their teachers , and vice versa , coupled with plenty of witty dialogue and as the story develops , moments of heartfelt situations as well . Peppered with an eclectic soundtrack , the story at times felt loaded with lead . And for one who have never seen the play or read much about it , the last act came as a surprise , and with brilliant editing in transition , it struck me as something quite different , and wrapped up the movie quite perfectly , albeit the unexpected happening . The closing credits too were well done , and I thought I actually surprised myself by remembering these technical details rather than the story . Inspirational ? Perhaps . Witty ? Sure . But somehow it lacked the oomph to propel it to greatness in my books .
515470	317399	420294	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning	It takes a lot to make me wince , given the numerous gore movies that hit our shores like Hostel , Severance and the likes , and surprisingly , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning , surpassed the rest in actually making my hair stand on ends . Perhaps it's because I wasn't immersed into the mythos of the chainsaw wielding psychopath and his family of cannibals . Supposedly based on one of the most notorious criminal families in Texan history , these folks operate like the characters from Tsui Hark's New Dragon Gate Inn , exploiting the innocent who happen to cross their paths , being in the wrong place at the wrong time . Already this clich√© has been used to death ( pardon the pun ) in movies of the same genre , but this was one of the first ( The original was released in 1974 ) , , with a number of sequels ( one even starring Viggo Mortensen ) , and remakes ( one starring Jessical Biel recently , produced by Michael Bay ) . So what is it that makes Thomas Leatherface Hewitt a hit ? It's the weapon baby . The chainsaw is music to the ears , and it is raw power . In the right hands , it's a lumberjack's weapon of choice in sawing down some trees . In the hands of a psycho , plunging it into someone brings about a sickening squishy sound of metal grinding against flesh and bone . And that , is the sick pleasure one gets when watching the movie . There is nothing too brainy about the storyline , given that it's a prequel trying to explain how things came about , and because it's something that chronologically had happened before , there's no prize in guessing who survives , or not , which makes the finale a bit of a bore . I think I am , and the audience too , are sick in wanting to watch our eye candy cast , whom we don't really give a damn about , become target practice for one of the cult killers of cinema . There are supporting characters who join in the fray , but ultimately , it's still focused on one of the first two couples who have their opportunity to make or break with our killers on the loose . It's a mixture of capability - some utterly useless and cowardly , while others , like Chrissie ( Jordana Brewster , she's hawt ! ) had more to do than just looking good , or scared , or shitting in their pants . To watch this uncut , uncensored in R21 glory , and anticipating those moments when Leatherface discovers the joy and pleasure of using the chainsaw , makes this movie the largest guilt trip I have undertaken this week . And to think I watched this before my week long hiatus too : PWelcome to the slaughterhouse .
515386	317399	443701	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The X = Files : I Want to Believe	It's not hard to imagine how time flies , when you realize that one of your best loved television series of all time had already ended its run , and you reminisce the times back when one of your weekend nights revolved around sitting in a bunk with your army mates , all glued to what Chris Carter had conjured as adventures for the two best known goggle box FBI agents , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . While we always needed to crank up the volume to try and make sense of the murmurs involving shadow governments and secret conspiracies , our favourite episodes almost unanimously were those one-off ones , so called the " monster " episodes . And it's been 6 years since The End , and 10 years since the first X-Files movie hit the screen . While that movie was intricately linked to the major conspiracy thread , this movie , as the trailer led us to believe , was a one-off monster episode , or so I thought . While it's indeed a one-off episode , it's no monster of an episode in the mould of those in the television series , though it really felt like an extended , stand alone episode which gave us a slightly more in depth look at the dynamics of our beloved duo , especially what happened to them in the last few years they went off the FBI radar . But as the saying goes , you can't put a good man , and a lady , down for too long . This is a story about obsession . As we all know , Mulder's obsessed with everything X - classifiable , and in the years of absence , here comes an opportunity for a breath of fresh air when Agent Dakota Whitney ( Amanda Peet ) comes knocking to seek his expertise , as the FBI now has a case on their hands and a psychic , convicted pedophile of a Catholic Father Joseph Crissman ( Billy Connolly ) who volunteers key information to help in that case . The FBI isn't sure if Father Crissman is a liar , or worse , connected to the crime , and hence Mulder's help is to be their lie-detector . Naturally with religion and her usual cynicism in the mix , Scully is disgusted by the sheer presence of the religious felon , and thus set the stage for some conflict with her beau . Like an old , quarreling couple who can't seem to give way to each other , their philosophies clash as their interests - Scully battling the hospital system to save her young chronically ill patient - differ , and threaten to pull the couple apart . He thinks that she's not being supportive of his venturing into an X-case even though they're now civilians , while she thinks he's latching onto Father Crissman to use his prowess , if proved true , to find Samantha Fox . Which I thought would probably make an excellent sub plot , but alas the potential was dangled like a carrot in front of us , and then went totally off tangent . Don't expect any big sets or intricate subplots here , as it really looked like it's done on a shoestring budget , with the look and feel of a typical classic television episode , a two-parter in fact . There are strange aberrations of course , but all these go unexplained , and you know they're just going to be glossed over since everything will be wrapped up by the time the end credits roll . However , there are adequate moments to keep you at the edge of your seat , and some developments do enough to leave your mouth gaping wide open , especially those involving extreme medicine . David Duchovny does look more comfortable reprising his role as Mulder , but Gillian Anderson , as interviews have revealed , required a lot more time trying to get back into character , and this uneasiness unfortunately shows on screen . The chemistry's still not lacking , but given that their respective characters have aged and grown more comfortable with one another , gone are the tensions between them , though the problems that surface here did try to rekindle some of the opposition they felt during the course of their long running series . Chris Carter and X-Files regular scribe Frank Spotnitz did incorporate a nice surprise in the movie , so do keep your eyes peeled as you will silently cheer when it happens . But I thought what was a ghastly way to bid farewell , was the little coda toward the end of the credit roll , which somewhat signals the finale of everything , though in a very out of place manner . Anyhow , this X-Files movie episode isn't going to win any new fans over , but for X-philes , I'd bet we're probably just satisfied already with our heroes appearing in celluloid one more time , that no matter how wafer thin the plot is , it's not going to dampen our collective fan spirit . And to thank our lucky stars that Mark Snow's iconic theme song , didn't get played in the movie under the horrific techno rendition .
514987	317399	924129	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Crossing Over	Like Crash , Fast Food Nation and Babel before it , Crossing Over consists of multiple story lines bound together by a common theme examined , sometimes with just a few characters straddling across the narrative threads to link them up explicitly . Writer-director Wayne Kramer examines the issues behind the illegal immigrant problem in USA who are either trying to lay low in avoiding the law , or trying their best to gain legal residency with each experiencing different challenges that lie ahead in their quest . And it's quite ambitious for Kramer to try and pull off no less than seven parallel threads in the film , which to a certain extent I felt was largely successful , despite some being almost peripheral if not for the presence of a recognized star . Anchored by Harrison Ford as Max Brogan , an Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agent , the film weaves in and out of the different threads without feeling too forced , or the need for some compulsory and carefully designed moments to link the stories up intricately . Sometimes like the six degrees of separation , the film captures the fact that we don't have full details of that web of links , and it will feel very artificial if everyone knew everyone else , or if one event would impact severely on another . In any case , each of the story lines were engaging enough , some employing deep emotions to argue their case , while others even had to build to a crescendo of all out action , such as a supermarket shootout ( one of the nicely executed ones I've seen ) . There's an illegal Mexican woman ( a very short role by Alice Braga ) who begs Ford's Max to look after her young son in the care of unfriendly relatives , a Jewish musician ( Jim Sturgess ) who's waiting to qualify for residency and willing to do just anything to get there , his Australian girlfriend ( Alice Eve ) and Hollywood actress wannabe who had granted 2 months worth of on-demand sexual favours to an Immigration official ( Ray Liotta ) in exchange for a green card , whose wife ( Ashley Judd ) wants to adopt a child placed in a detention centre , who meets an Iranian girl ( Summer Bishil whose essay failed to condemn the terrorists of and gotten her and her family into hot soup . Then there's a Korean family who is waiting to be naturalized whose eldest son got involved with thugs ( ala Gran Torino rites of passage style ) , and another ICE agent ( Cliff Curtis ) whose family cannot stand their estranged sister whom they feel is a disgrace of their values , tradition and custom by adopting the lifestyle of Americans , yet strangely ironic as they too pursue to be American citizens . Phew , and all this with a little murder mystery thrown into the mix as well . It's about how one aspires to live in a country , yet uncompromising in one's position to adopt and adapt to the new environment . Which brings about some xenophobia , especially if one's too different from the rest , and things are made worst with the citizens unwilling to understand and lend assistance in assimilation to a new country and its idiosyncrasies . But what seemed to be a common theme here , is how power can be either used to do what's probably morally right , versus abusing it for personal gain . Given three of the lead characters here are law enforcement or in responsible positions in government agencies , it's easy to abuse privilege , and it's nothing new too , even in local context , where sexual favours get traded for leniency or the closing of an eye pertaining to illegal workers , or those here without the proper papers . And since the law is fixed ( and sometimes perverse by those who interpret it ) , and justice blind , I suppose there are times we may be compelled to lend a hand to a stranger out of nothing but on humanitarian grounds , in doing what's right and decent for a fellow human being . Crossing Over presents many of such situations and while it may be a mixed bag in its narrative , it certainly pushes the right buttons with its star-studded ensemble cast in making the audience think about , empathize with , and examine if the issues presented could have existed in the local context , with similar challenges in the treatment of those who are illegal immigrants .
514766	317399	443649	7.0	A Nutshell Review : 10 , 000 B . C .	I guess not everyone has the audacity like Mel Gibson in taking risks related to the language used in their movies , for artistic integrity reasons . Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto both did not have their characters spout English , and had subtitles for the audience to rely on instead . And for a movie based in the era that its title states - 10 , 000 years before the birth of Christ - I do not suppose for one instance that our ancestral forefathers back in those days speak simple English , if at all . Then again , this is entertainment for the masses we're talking about . The main draw of 10 , 000 BC was of course the interaction of man and humongous , dangerous beasts of the time , and how through ingenuity in our natural ability to milk the Earth to make tools , mankind has ruled the Earth until now . But if like me you're expecting huge action pieces involving mammoths and sabre tooth tigers , what you get in their place are gentle elephants who go on a rampage no different from having computers plaster the correct bodykits over stampeding bulls , and a sabre tooth tiger count of ONE , and a pussy cat at that too . In essence , 10 , 000 BC tells of so simple a story , you'll believe that back then even hunky guys have their work cut out when they're going after the girl of their dreams . It's basically boy chases girl across the vast mountains and plains of the known world , because he had chosen to honour integrity than to win her hand over a mistaken recognition of bravery . And naturally to make our hero D'leh ( Steven Strait ) regret this decision , his lady love Evolet ( Camilla Belle ) and his fellow villages get enslaved and marched to Egypt to build pyramids for the gods ( OK , so I'm stretching that last statement ) . Villains are extremely weak , as they just have to look menacing without actually bringing across the feeling of immense threats that could be fatally carried out . Before you say that it's a carbon copy of the plot in Mel's Apocalypto and many others ranging as far back as Stargate , while Apocalypto had a man trying to save his family , this one's more of a pursuit of individual interests . And through his quest , a hero within D'leh will arise in a sort of coming of age tale of a prophetic savior who will lead everybody to salvation and to the promised land . Yes , tales of The One clich√© get plastered at every possible instance that you'll roll your eyes when the plot tries to throw some red herrings along the way in meek attempts to spice things up . And as each prophecy get explained , the more ridiculous it becomes , and when an ancient badly rendered drawing is shown carved against a rock in colour , you know that this is supposed to be one cartoony movie after all . Throw in some pathos about a long lost father , sacred weapons , and even a memorable fight scene in a bamboo forest ( I kid you not this time ) , you'll have enough material here to feel a sense of familiarity throughout the story , surviving on the novelty of having set some thousands of years ago . One thing you'll learn though , is that it pays being a gatherer and hunter with excellent javelin skills , and even Leonidas will have to kowtow to .
514604	317399	196229	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Zoolander	I am five years late . Just as I was so prepared to watch a Ben Stiller caper , with the posters all up at local theaters , the movie disappeared from the radar , and was banned in Singapore . Why ? Because the plot was about a fashion model being brainwashed ala The Manchurian Candidate to assassinate the Malaysian Prime Minister . Why ? Because Malaysia was being used as a sweatshop that hires child labor to manufacture cheap garments created by the western fashion houses , and they are not happy that the PM has outlawed working children . Hence the insane sounding plot right in the beginning . However , someone forgot to tell Ben that the Malaysian footage didn't look like Malaysia , but more like Tiananmen Square . Where got wave banners like that ? Got space meh ? But since we're friendly neighbors of Malaysia , when they banned it , we banned it too , to show solidarity . Anyway , for refusing to watch illegal downloaded copies , I was finally rewarded when GV decided to screen it here ( no more ban ? why now ? ) for a limited period , even though I suspect since it's a Village Roadshow production , why let it collect dust in the archives ? Ben Stiller co-created and plays Derek Zoolander , male model of the year 3 times in a row , with that killer Blue Steel look - an anal retentive look which actually seduces and is popular with the crowd . As most would already know , this comedy parodies almost everything about the fashion industry , like how himbotic male models can be , and amplified that dumbness more than 100 % . Zoolander loses his crown to up and coming male model Hansel ( played by Owen Wilson with long flowing locks , surfer dude style ) , and decides to retire . But since the chief villain and fashion guru Mugatu ( Will Ferrell ) requires a dim-witted model to be his assassin ( they have buff muscular bodies , and listen to instructions ) , his assistant Katinka ( Milla Jovovich , yummy ) brings Zoolander to a secret day spa to be brainwashed , and ready to be a killing machine during the opening of the Derelicte line of clothes . Real life Mrs Stiller Christine Taylor plays Matilda , a nosy journalist who tails Zoolander to try and get to Mugatu , and gets entangled in the assassination plot . But don't worry , the storyline isn't as complex as I've described . It's filled with plenty of insane subplots and scenes , like Zoolander's retirement decision to join his dad and brother ( Jon Voight , and an uncredited Vince Vaughn , who doesn't speak a word ) , an orgy of sorts with dwarfs , and even a walk-off competition between Zoolander and Hansel , with closure that comes straight out of Stephen Chow's campy movies . The real scream actually comes from the dozens of cameo appearances of the who's-who in the fashion and entertainment industry . Just as a flavor , there's Karl Lagerfield , Donald Trump , Tom Ford , Natalie Portman ( who declares her love for Zoolander ) , Winona Ryder ( who tries to seduce Zoolander ) , Gwen Stefani , Heidi Klum , Fabio , Fred Durst , Paris Hilton ( ! ) , Victoria Beckham , and even Billy Zane . You can refer to IMDb to get the entire list of credited and uncredited appearances . But what's the icing on the cake is David Duchovny's role as an X-File-ish character straight from his Fox Mulder days . Simply brought back the memories , in a funny way , including the many 80s and 90s pop music injected into the movie . So for those who have held out to finally experience Zoolander's new Magnum look , this is your chance . The movie might be dated , but it sure doesn't feel that way . Great fun .
515436	317399	106457	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Strange Take of Oyuki	The Strange Tale of Oyuki is probably the raunchiest movie to date in this edition of the Japanese Film Festival . While the earlier Imamura movies shown do have sexual scenes , this one takes the cake in its eroticism , treading so close to being soft-porn like in the style of Hong Kong Category III movies . But hey , I'm not complaining ! Based on a novel by Kafu Nagai , this movie uses a short story of the same name , and at the same time infused it with real diary entries of Kafu's as well , making it seem like an amalgamation of his life and that pre-war story . Some however , have claimed that it's solely based on the novel , and the director Kaneto Shindo had changed the protagonist to the author himself . Whatever the case is , since I can't read Japanese , and until someone who has read the book in its original language and watched the film can advise , we shan't rack our brains about this aspect of it . The story follows the middle aged author , Kafu Nagai ( Masahiko Tsugawa ) , in his gallivanting ways from the 1920s to post war Japan . It actually took the first 30 minutes or so to establish the fact that his literary works , which consist mainly of yellow literature , is not welcomed by fellow peers . Moreover , he has the propensity to wine and dine women , becoming a Don Juan of sorts , with a notorious reputation after establishing a series of conquests in Europe and North America . The beginning actually painted him as a lonely man as well , unable to hold down a regular relationship , opting instead for fleeting ones with geishas and waitresses . Things start to change when Fate brings him to Oyuki , a prostitute , one rainy night , and romance start to blossom between the two despite his concerns about their age gap - he's close to 60 , while she's mid 20s . As they do the horizontal tango in between the sheets on a regular basis , she starts to really fall for him , while he , always on the apprehensive . It also brought to mind about How to Become Myself's issue on persona , as we see how Kafu engineers himself to be a pornographic photographer as a cover for his researching writer role . But it's not just sex and skin all the way . The movie allowed some suggestion of the geisha tradition and their skills in the art , and I was rather surprised at the hard anti-war stance and criticism that the narrative had taken up , with its documentary reel like scenes of the Imperial Army , and how because of the war the common folk are made to suffer with the constant barrage of air strikes nearing the end of the war . Masahiko Tsugawa provided some comedic relief in his acting , though I'm unsure if his wide - eyed eyeball look which seemed to draw more chuckles than anything else , and rubber faced expressions , were deliberate . As a man who decided early how to lead out his elderly life , I thought he had a somewhat stoic presence as an uncompromising man , and one who needed to get his rocks off . Yuki Sumida as the titular Oyuki , had actually won a number of awards for the role , and while her portrayal of the prostitute is sympathetic , I suppose she'll be best remembered for shedding her clothes instead . Unpretentious and straightforward movie which runs almost like a bio-pic , I do not deny The Strange Tale of Oyuki as being entertaining , for the right reasons of course . Definitely an easy movie to sit through after an almost week long program of heavier material .
514846	317399	465580	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Push	Push is one of those movies that gives you the deja-vu feeling that it's a quick hack job , because from the trailer alone , images of X-men as well as Star Wars come racing through your mind , what with talk about being born with special powers akin to being a mutant wanted by government agents , as well as in execution of those abilities as fluidly like a Jedi Knight would , with mind-tricks , Force Push and a prophecy to fulfil . It takes place in today's world , where some folks get to be born with powers that The Division ( aka the Dark Side ) classifies into broad terms like Pushers , Movers , Watchers , Sniffs , Shadows , Shifters , Wipers and Bleeders . Naturally there are good and bad guys within those classes , and The Division are a select few who have government backing to operate like Nazis and conduct experiments to make them all stronger , for weaponization ( yes , the DNA of the USA is to weaponize everything ) . The good guys though are not organized and are forever on the run from The Division , until a few of them decide to band together and fight for their rights . At least that would be a tad more interesting . Instead , we get a grouping of half-past-six heroes who have idled their potential and not honed it to perfection . Chris Evans ' Nick Gant is a drifter who spends his time trying to hone his powers to win in illegal street gambling . He's a mover , and one day gets found out by Dakota Fanning's Watcher just because she sees him in her hallucinatory state from the impressionistic pictures she constantly draws on a sketch pad . A lotus prophecy ( it's set in Hong Kong you see ) tells this second-generation power couple to band together in their common quest to find Kira Hudson ( Camilla Belle ) , a one time ex-flame of Nick's , and a mysterious briefcase , where by their powers and artifacts combine , they can bring down The Division , kinda like a solo shot in the dark to blow up the Death Star . Only that the promise doesn't actually get delivered because Push decided to dwell a lot on the bickering and planning stage , while leaving the intended finale either forgotten conveniently , or set aside for a straight to DVD sequel . So what makes this interesting ? Apparently I got my kicks out of watching the characters here struggle with their Cantonese . And as an action movie , it sure does have its moments , especially with that street-fighter enhanced fistfight between Nick Gant and what could possibly be The Division's most powerful Mover / Grunt Victor ( Neil Jackson ) . Djimon Hounsou plays the meanest badass in the movie with Push powers , able to command the weakest of minds ( read : supporting characters ) to do his bidding . His Henry Carver came across as a poor man's Samuel L . Jackson , and only SLJ can do what SLJ does best - be a mofo . Camilla Belle got wasted here as a damsel in distress , exhibiting some surprise moves once in a while ( and even that had implanted doubts ) , but generally nothing more than a flower vase . Dakota Fanning isn't new to the action movie genre since she had her firm grounding learning from Tom Cruise on how to run with fear ( thanks to War of the Worlds ) . I admire the now teenager in trying to put into good use her acting chops here , but the filmmakers decided to make her Cassie Holmes suffer a bad hair day throughout . Also , this film had exposed one of her flaws - while she's a good actress and all , she cannot play intoxicated ( teenage drinking to boost powers , hooray ) . Her drunkenness was one of the most unconvincing I've seen put on screen , and she too nearly wanted to break into laughter at her inability . Filmed entirely in Hong Kong , I caught glimpse from the end credits that Johnnie To and Milkyway got credited for the production . I guess if you want to film Hong Kong in a certain style , there's only the current Hot Property to turn to for consultation . Also , DOP Peter Sova had some very obvious use of the fish-eye lens that seem to mimic that of Christopher Doyle's in Fallen Angels . Most of the Chinese characters here are pretty weak , and not to mention unintentionally hilarious as well , with their shout-down powers of Pop Boy 1 ( Chi Kwan Fung ) and 2 ( Jacky Heung ) and a far superior Watcher ( Lu Lu ) trying to gain a one up against The Division through triad-styled turf wars . The plot might seem a little muddled as it tried hard to sound intelligent , and there are some illogical moments with characters popping up and about , coupled with some really tired and uninspiring lines and unclear character motivation . Not that it was an unentertaining film , it actually is . However , it's a movie purely for escapism purposes , this might just be a quick fix to your X-men addiction , if you look too much into it that you see the glaring loopholes that is .
514798	317399	1067086	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Sweet Rain / Accuracy of Death	The first thing that comes screaming to your mind when you come to know of this movie , is MEET JOE BLACK , yes in caps , and a nagging feeling that it's a rip off / copycat coming some 10 years after that Hollywood movie . Although this is based on the Japanese novel by Kotaro Isaka , you can't help but to ponder upon the similarities between the two movies . And it seems that Death / Grim Reaper , besides having a liking for black suits ( for obvious reasons ) , also have a liking for putting on pretty-boy faces . From Brad Pitt to Takeshi Kaneshiro here , the full house today was likely to be attributed to the many fan girls who were squealing their way through the movie each time Kaneshiro appeared on screen . I suspect if Death really looked like that , these girls would gladly spend 7 days with the good looking stranger , only to have him decide if they should fulfill their destiny and die , or be passed-over because of unfinished business . And there'll be a queue that will scream " Take Me , Please ! " So the Grim Reaper acts like a judge , taking his limited time in between getting to know the mark , with listening to music in record stores , one of his , and the pastime too of many peer Reapers . Kaneshiro calls himself Mr Chiba , and walks the mortal realm when he's given a mission of assessment , accessed through a door from the nether realms which opens up to the specific location where the mark is . And it really contains no surprise , even right from the start , where you'll know just whose door has Death come knocking upon . Armed with a deathly , though temporal , touch , he has to cover his hands in gloves lest he accidentally puts someone into comatose , which becomes his weapon of choice in self - protection , and the protection of others . And to think that he has roamed our world enough to know the intricacies and antics of us human beings , Sweet Rain still contains enough juvenile jokes when he has to tussle with phrases unfamiliar to him , especially when they have double meanings , or make figurative references , and of course , the fan girls just love it when Kaneshiro provides his puppy dog look when he becomes confused and seeks clarification . As a feature length movie , it's really made up of three distinct acts , and the middle one suffered through a whole emotional and narrative disconnect from the other two , with slow pacing and uninteresting yakuza characters to fill time . The main mark of this movie is Manami Konishi's Kazue Fujiki , a girl who works at the complaints department who is a classic down and out loner with few friends , no objective and goals in life , and keeps getting harassed by this middle aged man over the phone who persists in getting her to answer his queries , and strange requests . I thought the strength of the movie was in the lengths it took to establish Chiba's relationship with Manami , though credit to the story that it wasn't a rehash of Meet Joe Black by the time the ending rolled over . Manami Konishi's portrayal was also a departure from her sprightly turn in Udon , but ventured close to her role in Retribution / Sakebi , but hey , Chiba hit the mark when he said she looked prettier when she smiled , given that she's brooding in the movie most of the time . So I shan't spoil the story by recounting what happened in each act , but suffice to say that this movie is beautifully shot against a backdrop of rainy days which Chiba seemed cursed to work under each time he visits our world , but he's not lonely in his mission with the black pet mongrel who shadows him , and thankfully , doesn't speak out like what Hollywood would do , but communicate telepathically with Chiba , and through subtitles with us mortal folks .
514919	317399	300471	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Shanghai Knights	OK , I'll mention not of the bland storyline , not of the kung-fu action ( Jackie Chan seems to be a tad slower these days don't you think ? ) , not of the infamous ooh-la-la licking scene where a sultry Fann licks Owen . This review will focus on the gags . Yup , you got me . The gags , without which , the film will never be the same : 1 . The ( mis ) pronounciation of Chon Wang as John Wayne ( ok , this is carried over from the first film ) 2 . How Roy creates Sherlock Holmes ! 3 . How the aspiring police inspector-writer happened to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , and how he got knighted ! 4 . How Roy unwittingly gave away his creation Sherlock Holmes to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ( haha ! ) 5 . Charlie Chaplin appears in the show ! ( yeah , he's the kid you see in the trailers ! ) Now you know where he got his inspiration from ! 6 . Wonder what happened to Jack the Ripper ? Fann has the answer ! 7 . Automobiles are a weird invention , Roy ? However , nothing much can be said of your investments in zeppelins : P 8 . Moving pictures present a good investment opportunity And yes , stay on after the film ends . The outtakes , as usual , are always hilarious .
514648	317399	449951	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Ghajini DV	So the dust is beginning to settle for A . R . Murugadoss ' Ghajini starring Aamir Khan , given that it had broken , and is still continuing to rake in stellar box office receipt records for a Bollywood movie around the world . For me , it piqued my interest enough to revisit his 2005 Tamil version starring Surya Sivakumar in the lead role , with Asin who also starred in both versions as Kalpana , and Pradeep Singh Rawat as the villain , curiously not called Ghajini here , but Laxman . I shall leave comparisons with Christopher Nolan's Memento unmentioned because I've done so with my earlier review of Ghajini ( 2008 ) . Instead I shall focus more on the similarities and differences in the Murugadoss films , since he crafted both the screenplay and dialogue , and directed both movies with predominantly the same leads , save for the protagonist Sanjay Ramasamy ( Surya Sivakumar ) inflicted with short term memory loss . The opening credits stayed similar , and for the first half hour , I thought I would be watching the same 2008 movie all over again . I see the same policeman ( Riyaz Khan ) going through the same investigations and employing tactics seen before , and even the scene transitions relied on the same time lapse technique already seen . The structure of the story remained for at least two-thirds of the film , and especially the romance between Kalpana and Sanjay , except for distinct differences such as the knowledge of who the chief villain is with the possession of the all important polaroid , and spending some time showing how Sanjay had tattooed himself with the clues . While it may be easy to work on a remake , given that you're basically rehashing what you've done before , and more so with experienced actors in the same role again , it is easy to free fall into complacency and to go through the motions with your own remake especially . But kudos to Murugadoss for identifying plot loopholes , and to make changes for the better in the Hindi version , rather than to import such flaws wholesale into the new movie . Obviously the production values were ramped up significantly from this version , but that's not the only thing that had improved . as was the editing . The pace here is pretty much slower , and had plenty of fat which were removed in the latest version . Tweaks were done for the better in the latest , especially so in the editing department to gel scenes together much more effectively . Here , you get abrupt jumps and cuts , so the narrative turned out to be a bit choppy at times , especially so when it's time for the rudimentary song and dance sequence which pops out from almost nowhere . Sorely missed were the daily routine that Sanjay would have to relive everyday , which I thought was an important scene to reinforce his difficulty in trying to hunt down the gangsters . The final act turned out to be an all out whackfest without too much thought put into making this film more plausible , opting instead for a pseudo-terrorist hostage situation . You could tell from the onset at this point that there were a few scenes Murugadoss would have elected to do differently , such as to avoid having Sanjay as a muscled and skilled fighter from the onset , with exaggerated Kollywood styled prowess to boot too . These were toned down for Bollywood , and having Aamir show off his six-packs from extreme training also helped to make it believable . Murugadoss also decided to downplay and eliminate the complicated finale battle here , which made use of wire-fu , and his decision to change the that battle to that seen in the Hindi version , is much appreciated for creating a stronger sequence altogether . Even the very last scene of his reworked version fared miles better since it sent home some very strong emotional chords to the audience , rather than this version here which actually was quite creepy ( my first thoughts were of reincarnation ! ) Music wise , with all due respect to Haarris Jayaraj for his work here , I thought A . R . Rahman's actually worked better . The music here , while still effective , was a little downbeat , and the picturization ( if that's what it's called ) could have been vastly improved , many times being something like watching a tacky 80s made music video . Compare Guzarish and Sutrum Vizhi ( which is my favourite song of the lot in this film ) , and you'll see what I mean . The placeholders for music to come on were pretty much the same , save for this version having what I thought was 2 distinct pieces reworked or removed totally from the remake for pace purposes . Sutrum Vizhi has this really hypnotic , head-banging beat to it . My frank opinion would be to watch the Hindi version not because it's vastly superior , but for its production values as well as a more coherent story reworked for a much better result . This version is still valuable in terms of seeing how far everyone had come , and for fans of Asin , this is the film that provided her that breakthrough in her career . The Region Free DVD by Venai Holdings is presented in matted letterbox format . Visual transfer is average at best , seemingly done off a VHS quality source . Toward the last hour there's this curious green tinge at the top right hand corner , but wasn't irritating enough to mar the enjoyment of the film . At times there were some pops and cackles in the visuals as well , but nothing too serious . Audio quality is in stereo and in the original language track , with English subtitles as an option . No other extra features contained in the DVD . Guess I shall wait for Ghajini 2008 to see if it comes with a special edition of sorts for some making of documentaries . Given the box office success , I don't see why not .
514567	317399	465502	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Igor	With a barrage of ultra cute characters ruling animated worlds these days , one wonders if macabre characters would appeal if not coming from the creatively dark mind of Tim Burton . With wonderful animation flicks like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride being tentpoles for animation touching on darker themes and realms ( as with festival darlings such as Fear ( S ) of the Dark ) , Igor would find itself in good company , and it lives up in certain terms to belong . Voiced by the excellent John Cusack , Igor is a typical hunchback and because of his physical disability and rights ( or lack thereof ) in the land of Malaria , Igors in general have a single career path , and that is slave to the scientists of the land . Yearning to be one of the greatest scientists one day despite societal perception and prejudice , opportunity arises when his master kicks the bucket , and he seizes the opportunity to do what the scientific community cannot do - create life . Of course in order to clinch the yearly accolade of scientist of the year , the creation must have a mean killing / horrific streak , but Igor's creation of Eva ( Molly Shannon ) is actually that of a kind soul with an addiction for the theatre and the arts . Not very suited to scaring and beating up opponents . So in a tussle between the actual being and her intended role comes an unlikely romantic story that somehow managed to touch the hearts , resembling how in relationships one tend to change the other subconsciously ( or consciously for some ) , and vice versa . Adversary comes in the form of scam scientist Dr Schadenfreude ( Eddie Lizard ) and his chameleon wife Jacklyn ( Jennifer Coolidge ) who scheme to steal Eva away from Igor and fulfill her intended evil purpose , and it's up to Igor and his crazy creations and sidekicks Scamper ( Steve Buscemi ) and Brian / Brain ( Sean Hayes ) to save the day . Some of the best lines were reserved for the banter between Scamper and Brain , and I thought these two characters actually lift the movie when it fell prey to the tried and tested story formula , providing some genuinely funny moments when you least expected . The animation here really challenged the notion of having everything aesthetically pleasing . Here , the filmmakers went for god-awful ugly , but yet having the magical effect of making it appealing . As a reminder not to judge a book by its cover , one can often feel repulsed by the lack of proportions in Eve's build , but what she lacks for on the outside , gets immensely compensated by the good on the inside . And it is this cheery disposition in spite of a gruff exterior , that exudes throughout the movie as well . With a surprisingly star-studded supporting voice cast with the likes of Christian Slater , Jay Leno , John Cleese and even Arsenio Hall , Igor may not have scaled new heights in animation techniques nor with its fairy-tale story , but for what it lacked it made it up for with plenty of heart . And I guess for an animated story , that will always be premium and will always matter .
515232	317399	411270	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Beat That My Heart Skipped	I think Thomas Seyr ( Romain Duris ) could be any of us in the working class . Stuck in two worlds about what he really wants to do , versus what he has to do . In the shady corner of the real estate business relying on underhand tactics , he finds no joy . In the other world which presented itself as an opportunity to start again , he must upgrade in order to be accepted . It never is easy , then again , life never is to begin with . Constantly frustrated at his predicament , you begin to wonder towards which characteristics of his parents would he gravitate to - the father , who's about to remarry , and is living the life that Thomas secret disapproves , and that he fears he's subconsciously becoming his father's son , or his deceased mom , an accomplished pianist . Given the chance to dig deep into his potential of following in his mom's footsteps , he thought he could find joy in emulating his mother's success , but success always is the outcome of hard work , and plenty of frustrations along the way . With the help of a Chinese pianist ( played by Linh Dan Pham ) , he sets himself a goal to be ready for an audition to set a new future for himself , and the classical music numbers greatly contrasts with Thomas ' choice of Euro-techno music which he plays over his beautiful earphones , and I enjoyed prior to watching the movie , thanks to a friend who introduced me to Telepopmusik's Just Breathe , which was used . While juggling between real work , and his potential aspiration , things go awry with his love and sex life , when he falls for one of his friend's wife , and when his dad gets mixed up with and swindled by Russian gangsters . I particularly liked the scene where he sought out the Russian Minskov , where he goes about without a clue to try and straighten things out with the mobster , only to have him call and threaten him loudly over the phone , in the sudden presence of a passer-by . And what he did for revenge , was totally comical too , in context . There are moments in this film which painfully brings out themes of frustration , of being lost at a crossroads , and of deciding for oneself what your calling is . Decide for yourself if you're up for some serious fare about the choices presented in life , and about that leap of faith that you take in trying to achieve some of those goals .
514981	317399	1400352	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Malaysian Gods	During the mini-seminar session , Amir mentioned that Malaysian Gods had been passed without cuts back home , but also not permitted to be publicly screened . It's no surprise to this as he admitted , given the buzz the authorities had unwittingly created because of their banning of his previous film The Last Communist . Hence the situation this film is now in . But as usual , from watching this across the Causeway , one wonders if political / politics-related films which might see the respective authorities on either side frown upon , would find an audience at the other side given a piqued interest , as well as hey , it's not talking about us here so we're cool about it ? Strategy-wise , Malaysian Gods had adopted the same approach as Amir's earlier movies like The Last Communist and Village People Radio Show , which consists of visiting the actual sites where the movement had occurred , and interviewing people in talking heads fashion in a more natural setting . There's a slight departure here though , where interviews are not with figures directly involved in the events presented , perhaps not wanting to ruffle any current feathers since it might inevitably be sensitive with the major players on all sides still being around . What we have instead is a documentary told in chapters commemorating the 10 years since the Reformasi movement began in 1998 starting with the protests led by Anwar Ibrahim after his sacking from his Deputy Prime Minister post . For non history buffs , the documentary provides some insights that began from the past , and had its eye firmly focused on the 8 % of the Malaysian population who are ethnic Indians with Tamil as the common language between them . Told in chapters , the film plays out like reading a history book , with inter-titles cluing you in on specific historical events , before bringing you back to its present day location , and conducting interviews with some everyday folks . The narrative moved from place to place where significant events had happened , and interviewing what could probably be the most colourful character the filmmakers could find in the vicinity , such as the kacang ( nuts ) seller , contractors , salesmen , cinema operators , and your man on the street who just happens to be out on a date . In terms of venue , we get to see prominent landmarks like the National Palace , the KLCC park , the Chinese Assembly Hall , KL's oldest Tamil cinema , and it goes right down to the simple barber shop right around the corner . While it might seem quite random in picking off people from the streets and talking to them , there's a method in that when asked some pointed questions about the location's significance , or whether the interviewee had been involved in those events in one way or another , there are a few interesting nuggets of the human psyche which unfolds . I guess in today's economic climate , everyone's more concerned with their personal rice bowl issues , and can only remember things that hit closer to home rather than mass protests or demonstrations which seem like a disruption to economical pursuits . Either that , or they are personally guarded from freely discussing those issues since a video camera is pointed in their direction . However , you can see that while everyone has their own issues to air , those of the older generation tend to be more reserved and afraid of repercussions , compared to the younger generation who are not afraid to discuss them quite directly and speak their minds on things they feel are going against them , such as the education system . I suppose when push comes to shove , they are more than willing to express themselves than to continue keeping quiet , and this in itself perhaps gave way to a representation of what we've been seeing in the political climate up north , with some drastic changes to the landscape already made . The film is never dry , and is rife with wry humour throughout in true Amir fashion . Against the backdrop of a downfall of a leader and the rise of his party and movement , one can find some rib-tickling moments either from the interview subjects themselves , or from the subtitles which you have to pay some attention to , as illustrations pop up like easter eggs , and you have to look quite closely for things like skewed logos . Or a shot of a car I found quite amusing as the driver clearly violated traffic flow direction , and found himself turning into the Traffic Police HQ . If you've enjoyed Amir's previous works like The Last Communist , and Village People Radio Show , then grab any opportunity you can get to watch his latest film , before he embarks on an announced film-making hiatus .
515134	317399	318649	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sahara	The trailer of this film does not do it any justice , as it presented this film like another rehash of Nicholas Cage's National Treasure , given the success of that film at the box office . While this show is somewhat a treasure hunt adventure , the focus is far from that , as it manages to put in many different subplots and mix them well together , even though each subplot takes up little screen time . You have two treasure hunters ( Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn ) , a World Health Organization doctor ( Penelope Cruz ) , Mali warlords , a French industralist ( our favourite Matrix Merovingian without the exaggerated French accent ) , with plots about pollution and toxic waste , a Civil War era iron ship , feuding factions , shady clandestine organizations and treasure hunting . Based upon a Clive Cussler novel , the feel of the movie is like an Indiana Jones adventure , with interesting and sometimes comedic action sequences , its own catchy Dirk musical theme ( that could be a mainstay if this show has its own franchise ) , a capable sidekick who provides the laughs , and even makes subtle digs at Indiana Jone's penchant for not losing his fedora hat . I've never watched a Matthew McConaughey flick since his major debut in A Time To Kill ( also based on a novel , by John Grisham ) , and if this movie proves successful , he might be on his way to a new movie franchise . Steve Zahn manages to bring across the comedy with uncanny timing , and Penelope Cruz , well , what more can I say ? If you enjoyed National Treasure , don't let the trailer fool you into thinking that this show is similar . It's more .
515279	317399	409904	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Day Watch	We were made to wait for more than 2 years since the debut of Timur Bekmambetov's Night Watch , Russia's groundbreaking science fiction fantasy movie which promised a trilogy with the following two movies , Day Watch and Dusk Watch to follow . The first movie opened to much fanfare here with overnight festivities and a graveyard hour premiere , but reality set in soon after that local audiences perhaps aren't game for something too foreign , despite it that it stuck to the familiar action-effects formula . So Day Watch will soon premiere on the local screens with less of the ra-ra fanfare , and while it helped a bit with its summarized recap of the first movie , my advice would be to ensure that you'd watch Night Watch first so that the characters who appear don't look too odd to you , and it'll be more satisfying come the ending because it makes the two movies just perfect and a wrap up . Which of course brings to question Bekmambetov's original vision of a trilogy , because I certainly can't see how it can happen now without throwing a spanner into the works . The movie continues from where it left off the first movie , fast forwarded 12 years , where Anton ( Konstantin Khabensky ) is still taking on the Master role in tutoring his new padawan Svetlana ( Mariya Poroshina ) , who is touted as possibly the next Great One who had joined their side . Those of us in the know will already be in the loop what happened to the first Great One , and because movie prophecies are always self fulfilling , we get a hint of what's to come for the finale . The movie still focuses on Anton , and he makes an interesting central character because he is just about as flawed as can be , and not the all powerful character given there are many others in the movie absolutely more capable and powerful than he is . There's no boy scout in his character to bore you , and he constantly does things according to his fancy , which almost always gets him into trouble , with his continued pining for his son . And it is this less than heroic characteristic , that somewhat endears us to his internal struggles . The father-son theme also takes on another dimension with Kostya ( Aleksei Chadov ) and his butcher father ( Valeri Zolotukhin ) , but while it had a number of minor sub plots strung together , they rarely strike that emotional chord in you , as thee stories are conveniently serving as leads to the next big special effects scene . Some of these scenes you can tell were added to show off the effects capability - they look beautiful , but don't further the plot much . Think of it as nice decorative flower vases , and worse , contribute to certain plot loopholes and implausibilities as well . But wait , we're talking about a fantasy movie here , so it could be forgiven . A gripe that I had was how wimpy the characters in the movie had become . Gone are the glorious battles from the first movie , where the rooftop m√™l√©e was one of my favourites . What we have in Day Watch are plenty of scheming and plotting , and less of the fisticuffs . Even when it came to slugging it out , they were less than menacing and quite ordinary compared to its grittier , and darker predecessor . What made me chuckle a bit was the ditching of sensibilities and a tit-for-tat nod to Hollywood with its big bang disaster styled development , which certainly was uncalled for , but no doubt a you-can-do-we-can-do-too response . And some might be irked by the cop out ending , that it's much ado about nothing after all given the brou-ha-ha about the all powerful Chalk of Fate , but it's an ending which is perfect when you put Night Watch and Day Watch together . One thing's enjoyable for sure , is the return of the funky subtitles . Since the movie is in Russian save the English language monologue recap , and for non-Russian speakers like yourself , sometimes reading subtitles might be a bit of a bore . But kudos here , like its predecessor , for intricately crafting nice looking , effects filled subtitles to enhance our reading pleasure . For non-fans of the first movie , you'll probably give this one a miss , or for those who have not watched Night Watch , then you might walk out halfway given that it's relatively difficult to follow ( there were walk outs in the screening I attended ) . But for the fans , then this movie is a reason to celebrate closure . Definitely an acquired taste !
514542	317399	485863	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Battle of Wits ( Muk Gong )	The warring states of Ancient China serve as a backdrop for this pan-Asian war epic , starring the charismatic Andy Lau . Going by the literal translation of the Chinese title , it's " Ink War " , alluding to the fact that much of the battles in this movie relies a lot more on superior strategy in order to overcome a mammoth battle against a Goliath , with a 4 , 000 population up against the might of a 100 , 000 strong well-trained army . Based on a Japanese novel / manga Bokkou , Battle of Wits fictionalizes one of the episodes during 370BC , where China was still divided , and each nation seizing opportunities to usurp the other . Those familiar with history will know that eventually , the kingdom of Qin will ultimately unite the Middle Kingdom for the first time . However , the story sets its sights on the Kingdom of Zhao leading an attack on the smaller state of Liang . In its defence lies a mysterious man from the Mozhi tribe known as Ge Li ( Andy Lau of course ) , who galvanizes Liang's population to stage a stand against what seemingly looks like impossible odds . While war movies of long , long time ago have been flogged to death recently by Hollywood , with films like Alexander , Troy , and fantasy epics like the Lord of the Rings series , Asian movies have rarely scratched the surface until of late , with Battle of Wits leading the charge , and coming right up are at least two film adaptations of episodes from the Romance of the Three Kingdom novels . For those expecting fantastical and romanticized wu-xia martial arts moves , you will be disappointed , as this movie is rooted much in reality . Given the epic scale of this production , it still rings a sense of familiarity in its war scenes , and I thought that shooting most of them in middle-close range , loses much of its grandeur . The big spectacles shown have nothing new that will take your breath away , especially after Hollywood has plundered such productions . Nonetheless it augurs well that Battle of Wits managed to pull off a production of this nature , and has , surprise , a competent storyline to carry it through . There is a strong anti-war message that got worn on the sleeves Ge Li , as smart and cunning as he is , he's the reluctant hero , willing to make sacrifices for the greater good . He finds no pleasure in war , nor killings , but in order to save the masses , he must do what he has to thwart efforts of bloodthirsty kingdoms . He's is the message of " loving thy enemy " , naturally not shared by the incompetent leadership in Liang . And since time immemorial , you always have the incompetents possessing the heart of insolence , with characters of sloth and ill intentions , straddling from a high horse . Inept leaders silencing their opposition through calls of treason is a tactic all too familiar , which makes it all the more despondent as you ponder about that aged old Chinese proverb about there being nothing wrong in looking after your personal interests first , instead of bothering with the affairs of others . Ge Li faces both the task of winning over the people's trust ( since they're committing the state's defences to his organization ) , and the inevitable unappreciative , thankless task of having to do just that . As I mentioned , do not expect to see " Qing Gong " or fancy swordplay . Rather I was in awe with the delivery of strategies and counter strategies in having two warring factions pitting their wits against each other . Sometimes they come rather unexpectedly , and will leave you with a smile , like when you're wondering just what everyone is up to when they close their eyes en masse . Accompanied by an excellent soundtrack , the movie could be split down two halves , and while the first centered on the macro affairs , a more micro , personal affairs of the heart managed to creep in between Ge Li and Yi Yue ( the gorgeous Fan Bingbing ) , a calvary officer , and though their romance sometimes stalled the pace of the movie , it added some gravitas to Ge Li the Man , questioning his strong beliefs on being unselfish , and made the finale all the more heart-wrenching to watch . Featuring stars like Wu Ma and Nicky Wu ( when was the last time I saw them in a movie ) and Korean actor Ahn Sung-kee , this certainly is the movie to watch this week . Forget about them animated penguins , treat yourself to an epic worthy of your time , and well worth a weekend ticket .
514527	317399	814314	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Seven Pounds	Two years ago , director Gabriele Muccino collaborated with Will Smith successfully in their year end offering of The Pursuit of Happiness , which while based on the struggles of real life struggler made good Chris Gardner , had a saccharine sweet and triumphant ending befitting of the end of year mood of putting the last year behind you , and looking forward to a better tomorrow . This time round however , the Muccino-Smith partnership has brought about a sustained doom , gloom and heaviness throughout the film that perhaps accurately mirrors current sentiments of the downturn that doesn't look to go anywhere upwards next year as well . There's nary a light-hearted moment in the film , and it begins in what would be uncharacteristic of Smith to be barraging down on a visually handicapped person ( Woody Harrelson in a very subdued , supporting role ) , insulting him and calling him names . In fact , you're more than likely to feel kind of angry with Smith's Ben Thomas , an IRS tax man who continues his verbal assault over the telephone on a stranger whom he doesn't know , yet . You see , it's all a test of character . Ben Thomas is a man on a mission , and while the filmmakers would like you to think that his ultimate aim was something still kept under wraps , it doesn't take long before you decipher just what he's up to , given a clue right from the start of the film that he intends to take his own life , and little hints dropped every now and then . Ben wants to help seven people before his demise , and just how he's going about doing so , is the subject of almost two hours in the film . The plot brews rather slowly , and curiously , doesn't bore even as it doesn't keep you guessing for long . It holds out the real reason and verbatim rationale why he's doing what he's doing , though cynics in us might deem it as an extreme case of seeking redemption . But thankfully , we got Will Smith's acting ability to keep our attention arrested , because he has shown that he's as adept to big budgeted action blockbusters , as he is with strong drama dealing with human emotions . While you may question Ben's technique , you cannot deny that here's a man that's set in his ways that even best friend Dan ( Barry Pepper ) could do nothing to change his course , and only to respect his wishes to carry everything through when the time calls for it . And central to this story , is the relationship between Ben and Emily Posa ( Rosario Dawson ) , a woman who's dished out a death sentence that could happen at any time because of an impending heart failure . It is this story-arc that takes up the bulk of the screen time , and the other benefactors from Ben's magnanimous benevolence only became side shows , with 2 of them just lip service , which was a disappointment because they were relegated to copping out ( or the lack of screen opportunities ) . But it is this love story that could and yet couldn't be , that was achingly heart-wrenching to watch . At first I had dismissed this as yet another star-crossed lovers type of story that Fate had a hand in , but this relationship grows on you , and while it looked like an eventual 21 Grams , the chemistry between Dawson and Smith brought out the best in what could have become some really bad melodrama . I guess I always enjoy stories about sacrifices , and what more about the sacrifice that has to happen , as portrayed in the story , that makes it heartbreaking to bear witness to . Seven Pounds might turn away those looking for some fantastical , escapist storyline to take their minds off temporarily from current troubles , but for Will Smith fans , and those looking for something that doesn't choose to wince away from what it had set out to do , then this might be the film for you this New Year period . It might not have plenty to offer , but for powerful performances , then look no further than this piece .
514424	317399	427969	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Hollywoodland	Death under mysterious circumstances make good stories for the paper mills . And celebrity deaths all the more so , as they sell . The Curse of Superman is probably one of the well known controversies ( coincidences ? ) of today , and one of its victims was George Reeves , who played Superman in the 50s , and apparently committed suicide in his home one late night . The mystery and conspiracy theories are plenty , given that it's Tinseltown after all . Ben Affleck's second role as a costumed superhero , though this time it's indirectly as he's the screen version of George Reeves , who's better known , and type-casted as The Man of Steel . The Reeves portrayed here is a flamboyant has-been , looking for his next big break , but gotten romantically tangled with Toni Mannix ( Diane Lane ) , wife of MGM executive Eddie Mannix ( Bob Hoskins ) . Becoming a kept man , he's leashed to Toni Mannix's whims and fancies , and as the iconic hero of the immensely popular television series , becomes the reluctant role model for countless of young fans , who sometimes cannot tell the line between reality and fantasy . The movie takes on double narratives , one which chronicles the life and death of George Reeves , while the second is set in current reel time with a focus on private detective Louis Simo's investigations into the Reeves ' death . In part , Simo was serving his own self-interest , as this kind of investigations raises his profile , as well as bringing in the dough from Reeves ' mother , who believes there was something more to her son's death . The editing here is done excellently , as you'll hardly feel anything forceful or contrived during scene transitions , or transitions in time . Typical of a movie which doesn't present any new evidence , you're presented with various possibilities , and not having the movie commit to any one version . It's up to you to determine which is which , but I thought the last one was perhaps the most probable of them all , sad as it is , because of one of the final scenes which I thought would be more compelling reason . A has-been looking for his next big break , but because of circumstances , unable to break from the chains of typecast , and knowing that he's no longer a spring chicken . Frustrated , unhappy , and desperate perhaps . Ben Affleck brought out the troubles facing Reeves rather admirably , and the kudos he obtained for his role her is justified . Warner Brothers , who owns DC comics and in turn Superman , was reportedly unwilling to allow the filmmakers to use the original introduction of the Adventures of Superman television series , or to allow the trademarked insignia to be used in the movie . But when watching Hollywoodland , I didn't spot any marked departure from logos that we already all know , though it was a hoot that you'll see Superman with booze and cigarette . Perhaps it is this non-heroic image that DC / WB was concerned about ? On a side note , given the NC16 rating , there was one jarring edit , which pertained to the sex scene after the line " Maybe Superman does want to get laid " . You'll get to hear something , but the visuals jump cuts to an interior shot from a car . It's a tight drama with enough material for an adequate whodunnit , with good performances all round by the cast . I'd recommend it , if you're up for some dirt behind Tinseltown's glitz .
514483	317399	940709	8.0	A Nutshell Review : CJ7	It's been a long and almost 3 year wait for the coming of Stephen Chow's new movie CJ7 , on the heels of his international success with Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle , both of which were adapted / parodied / copied in the other two competitive movies this holiday season in Kung Fu Dunk and Ah Long Pte Ltd . If imitation is the best form of flattery , that goes to show who's the boss and who calls the shots in the innovation and creativity departments , that there's only one force to be reckoned with in drafting comedy that appeals to the world . You might think that I'm singing praises of Chow and his works , but yes , that's the skyrocket high expectations that he had built for himself over the years with his rapid fire mo-lei-tau ( nonsensical ) comedic movies entertaining the masses pre and post 1997 Hong Kong , and now he can afford to take his time in releasing his movies once they pass through his perfectionist quality control . Sitting through CJ7 , I had initially thought that it was amongst his weaker works , but then came the final act , which while it was emotionally manipulative , I cannot deny that I both laughed and cried at the same time , which is extremely rare , and only pulled off by Chow's knack of structuring his scenes . Chow has shown his pedigree in becoming a good storyteller . If he is not already being considered one , then CJ7 is a sign of better things to come , as slowly , it can be seen that he's giving up his presence on screen , and turning his attention to behind the camera instead . Even with movies like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle , while he was the lead actor , he still made room for his supporting casts to shine through . This time though , he had totally taken the backseat and gave the spotlight to the child actress Xu Jiao who plays Dicky , the son ( yes you read that right ) of Chow's construction worker character Ti . Being poor , Ti works extremely hard to send his son to a premier school to receive a good education , in the hopes that he will be able to break out of the poverty circle in time to come . But in being in an elite school , Dicky becomes automatic fodder for rich school bullies , who look down on him because of his social status . Much of the movie dwells on this schoolyard politicking , and with Ti trying hard to impart good principles to his son that it becomes somewhat repetitive . In trying to pacify his son who yearns for the latest toy in town , a high-tech robotic dog called CJ1 , Ti goes back to his favourite haunt , the junkyard , and picks up a green ball outfitted with an antenna , as a replacement toy . Without his knowing of course , this ball turns out to be an alien lifeform , and Dicky soon uncovers that it has magical abilities . Christened CJ7 , much of the laughs come from CJ7 and Dicky , in the form of spoofs ranging from Mission : Impossible 2 to Asian fare like Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , and also takes a spin from Chow's previous 2 movies . But don't expect the jokes to be of the mo-lei-tau type , as there aren't that many jokes to begin with . Gone are the days of laugh-a-minute type comedy from Stephen Chow . While toilet humour is still quite staple , Chow seemed to have embraced special effects even more this time , starting with a totally animated CJ7 , which has " cute " plastered all over it , making it a delight amongst the young and the female audience . I tell you , if it's not already available , someone should make the plush toy right now and milk it for all it's worth . Most of the jokes and fun sequences were spruced up by special effects , but there were a moment or two which I felt was quite unnecessary . In most ways , CJ7 isn't really your typical outright comedy . By the end of it , I thought its dramatic moments were tugging at the heartstrings , as I mentioned earlier , and indeed this somehow represents a shift by Chow to a somewhat different territory , building up his movie with comedy being peripheral or secondary to the main plot . There are moments of fun balanced by moments which are touching , episodes of the ridiculous balanced by episodes which made you reflect . And any more which features great songs , get my vote of approval too , with Boney M's Sonny getting plenty of airplay , and I Love Chopin coming on at just the very appropriate moment . However , what is still suspect though , is Chow's ability to weave more flesh into what are essentially flower vase roles in the female characters who play opposite him as love interests . With Shaolin Soccer , Vicky Zhao was unfortunately quite pedestrian , and with Kung Fu Hustle , the scope given to Huang Shengyi was worse . Kitty Zhang continues the trend as good looking teacher Mrs Yuen , who takes pity on Dicky , but nothing more . Having seen all the Lunar New Year movie premieres for this week , I can safely say CJ7 came out tops , because it had a lot more moments in the movie that makes it family friendly entertainment , and yet imparting and giving out reminders of good values that will almost certainly rub off on the young , and the young at heart . Not at his best , but Chow delivers yet another crowd pleaser , for sure . Recommended !
515491	317399	421994	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Imagine Me & You	I'm not sure if that bubblegum tune can belong amongst the gay anthems , given that Wong Kar Wai's had a gay themed movie titled Happy Together and used the same song too . Yes well , as you would already know , GLBT movies from UK are emerging , from Kinky Boots earlier ( one of my faves for the year ) , and now Imagine Me & You hitting our shores next week . Rachel ( Piper Perabo , a dead ringer for Rachel McAdams ) and Hector ( Matthew Goode , from Match Point ) are about to get married after years of courtship . On their wedding day , Rachel notices Luce ( Lena Headey ) from the corner of her eye , and from brief introductions turned into family gatherings , turned into something more . Rachel experiences strange feelings for Luce and the feelings turned out to be mutual , but what about Hector ? It's a classic case of everyone's worst nightmare come true , finding out that the person you're about to marry , or have married , actually loves somebody else , and that someone else being the same sex just compounds the effect . One character said in passing that anybody can swing to the other camp , before a slight hesitation , correcting that only probably he wouldn't . And that made an interesting caveat which the movie explores - how do you know if your sexual orientation is rock solid ( that might seem a " d'uh " statement until you watch the movie ) , or do you have the tendency to swing ( think Kinsey had a theory on this ) . What if you find yourself experiencing this inexplicable force of feelings you never knew for someone else , when you're already married or with a life partner ? And speaking of life partners , how do you know the one you're with , is the one for you ? And life partners being partners , must it always be in matrimony or strictly about the opposite sex ? At the end of the day , what matters is the chemistry and the ability to click , right ? The movie asks a lot of these questions beneath its cheerful yet melancholic veneer , although it never provides a straight answer . As always , you can replace the lesbian relationship here in the story with a heterosexual one , but it probably won't impact an audience as much ( just as Brokeback Mountain would work with a heterosexual couple , but will bore the heck out of audiences and not win any award at all ) . While the movie offers to suggest certain ideas like love at first sight , it doesn't really demonstrate that effectively ( more like lust at first sight ) nor seemed to have a valid reason to do so , though it toyed with the fleeting thought about reincarnation . You might feel that writer-director Ol Parker had filled the movie with plenty of romantic clich√©s and notions about setting someone free if you really love them , or the thought about being with someone you can live without rather than someone you can live with . In fact , the entire premise might be a bit contrived , but hey , if you think about it , the world is full of quirky events and people , so maybe something like this could happen too . This movie should do reasonable well amongst the GLBT crowd with its theme , and given the eye candy cast , probably will do well as a whole . It's nothing spectacular , just that as a movie , it should work the crowd like clockwork
514661	317399	190377	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Eating Air	That's the gist of most of the dialogue in this made-in-Singapore film , and it is the earnest dialogue that kept this film " real " and not cringeworthy if it had been polished English language skills used instead . Following the chronicles of Ah Bengs , Ah Boy , our anti-hero protagonist played by Benjamin Heng , introduces to us his gang of arcade playing , motorcycle riding , and rooftop gathering friends . While street corner gangs are not as sophisticated as organized hoodlums , they too practice their own brand of honor . Petty fights are common , and so are motorcycle challenges . But when his best friend Ah Gu chances upon drugs and borrows from loan sharks , what will happen to their friendship , as the challenges that they face become more and more dangerous . Romance is in contrast to the reality and ugliness of street gangs , With Ah Bengs , there surely is their Ah Lians hugging their torsos on bike rides ( jiak hong in Hokkien , for joyrides ) . Alvina Toh plays Ah Girl , Ah Boy's main squeeze . The moments together are bittersweet , boy-meets-girl , falls in love , boy-loses-girl , punctuated with an excellent soundtrack done by local acts like the Boredphucks . It's back to the old days where mobile phones are not as prevalent , and calls are made to each other using early technology like pagers and voice messages , which was nostalgic ( brought back some memories lah ) . Heng brought life to Ah Boy , with his crazy kung-fu imagination ( think Ally McBeal style ) , as he evolves from an aimless wanderer , to crazed impetious street kid who stands by his pal . Toh too plays her role convincingly , as a schoolgirl seduced by Ah Boy's carefree ways , to becoming someone with inner strength . This film manages to gel its subplots together , adding much to its depth . While its protagonists are street gangsters , it makes no attempt to glorify nor condone their actions , and therefore doesn't feel preachy on what's right or wrong . Adding the comedic touch are Michelle Chong , in her heavy accented mandarin as a lao chio photocopy shop owner , and Mark Lee , veteran TV beng who plays , what else , a dua kang lao beng who pines after a mysterious lady ( played by singer Kit Chan ) . It's always a blast to see familiar locales , and more so in a Singapore film . Places recognizable are Lucky Plaza and Katong Shopping Centre , and of course , the CTE takes a substantial chunk of the narrative , the location where we start off , and end . For some reason , I didn't catch this film when it was released in 1999 . Perhaps it's because of the unfamiliarity with local productions , and now I kick myself for being a tad myopic back then , but glad to have caught it during Screen Singapore . Think I'm gonna have one heck of a fun time as Screen Singapore progresses .
514789	317399	71544	8.0	A Nutshell Review : General Idi Amin Dada : Autoportrait	After watching this documentary on Ugandan dictator Idi Amin , you'd come to think that Forest Whitaker's award winning portrayal in The Last King of Scotland had given the military general more intellect , more cunning and definitely a more clear cut look at the nature of the man's evils . But in fact , from what you can glean from this documentary , he seemed to be more fuddy duddy , with surprising charisma whether or not due to his public demeanour , and his semi-illiterateness in the English Language ( again , Whitaker made him sound grammatical ) . Movies about political leaders are not new , and lately there's one that's also sanctioned by a leader himself , a made by a Singaporean documentary called A Hero's Journey , which presents a snapshot of the life of President Xanana Gusmao of Timor Leste . In this Idi Amin documentary , he has final word on what gets presented , and what not , and it's quite surprising that he's OK with making himself look like a buffoon , whether deliberate or not , leaves much to interpretation of his intent . You might say he wanted to show off what he can do , and what power he wields over his cronies , but on the other , there certainly are plenty of material which could easily have dented his popularity and aura . Watching him go through his motions just brought about a thought , that evil men need not wear their evilness or ruthlessness on their sleeves . Here , Idi Amin might be the real life personification of The Joker , smiling on the outside , but inside his heart harbours thoughts similar to the mentioned villain . He's like a charismatic comedian , and makes it difficult not to laugh at his atrocities because he really does have a lot of funny ideas . His mastery of the English language is woeful , but that doesn't stop him from speaking it , and the filmmakers subtitling every grammatical error he's made too , instead of correcting it for an audience . He's a self-professed soothsayer and an interpreter of dreams , and sends strange telegrams to various heads of state which reads like a script for a sitcom . He's often delusional as well , and some of the highlights of this documentary , which has to be seen to be believed , include his imaginary war games to take the Golan Heights from the Israelis given his very puny army , laughable air force and armour , and best of all , training his paratroopers on a children's slide . What cannot be missed as well , are his briefings to the country's doctors and to witness him holding court as one of his cabinet meetings , which was so full of contradictions and hare-brained ideas , you can't help but laugh at the farce of it all . You can just imagine how any country could be run with jokers like these in power . He can't speak , can't communicate , and basically doesn't even know an iota about running a military ( besides the rudimentary appreciation of semi-automatic weapons ) , let alone a country . He's full of personal prejudice and practices discrimination , but one thing's for sure , he's quite a musician , having contributed to the soundtrack of the film . If you think you want to go beyond The Last King of Scotland to look at this dictator up close and personal , then this documentary should be your first step in trying to understand the contradiction which is His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr . Idi Amin , VC , DSO , MC , King of Scotland Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular ( yes , that's his official title ! )
515298	317399	397614	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Robocon ( Robokon )	Robocon is today's third movie , and the most satisfying one of the day's selection . Written and directed by Tomoyuki Furumaya , this movie's premise allowed for a sneak peek into one of Japan's many robotic competitions . The pretty Masami Nagasawa ( last seen in Crying Out Love at the Center of the World ) stars as lazy girl Satomi , who got assigned a stint , against her wishes , at her school's Robot Club . However , it's not the premiere club that she got assigned to , but the " B " team where the team members are hardly cooperative , made up of a motley bunch of losers . There's the ineffective soft spoken captain of the team , the genius arrogant designer , and a technician who dropped out but decided to join them again when the team had inexplicably entered the Nationals through a technicality . Her role in the team ? She's the designated driver , the operator of the machine , needing to learn how to be one with the robot through the use of the remote control . In the spirit of the theme of this year's film festival , naturally a whole section of the movie has put focus on how this group of students undergo boot camp - in a training regime at a beach resort - to build camaraderie , trust and friendship as they spend their off hours in designing and fine tuning their prototype YET-13 , into Boxhund , their entry for the finals . It's like a coming of age movie , with the characters developing skill sets , and in the further discovery of their strengths and weaknesses , combined with their willingness to change for the better , not just for themselves , but for the team . Although the narrative's pretty straightforward , it managed to create a sense of tension and a highly charged environment as our team challenges their competition through various round robin stages , and it is this part of the film that showcased the innovation and ideas of some of the robots , their wacky designs , and various functionalities . It's not easy just to build the robot , but how to maintain it through various stages , to think on your feet to solve technological challenges and the need for maintenance under time limit . Also , it takes a lot of with to try and outplay the competition , and every stage of the competition , just brings about the right amount of challenges , strategies , and how they are overcome . You'll also come to appreciate many of the rules put in place for the competition , and probably will pique your interest to learn a lot more . This is a highly recommended film , and I suspect it is already amongst the movies that I'll come to enjoy from the festival .
515213	317399	379786	8.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Serenity ( 2005 )	The back story of Serenity and its TV series Firefly is what stuff like soap opera is made of . Created by Joss Whedon , popular creator-scribe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel television series , the Firefly television series was yanked from the airwaves by Fox midway through its first season , but as all real life fairy tales go , the series was released on DVD , and became an instant cult classic . Hence , the movie was born given the built fan base . And having not watched the Firefly series , I think Serenity is a satisfyingly good sci-fi movie which can stand alone . Although it will take some getting used to the characters , it'll not take too long before you get into the swing of things to enjoy what this movie had to offer . Serenity refers to the Firefly class of spaceships in an era of the future where planets are colonized and banded together as an Alliance , with a band of rebels opposing the oppression of a totalitarian regime . Think of Star Wars scenario of an Empire with its Rebel Alliance , and Star Trek with its ship and crew in focus , combined . We follow the adventures of Captain Malcom Reynolds ( Nathan Fillion ) and his crew of merry men and women ( doctor , navigator , pilot , ex-lover etc ) as they undergo a rescue mission of one of their own , River Tam , who's a psychic turned dangerous weapon , or so they think . While they unravel the mystery and secrets of what River knows , they must outrun the ruthless Allaince's assassin who's after River , as well as fend off the deadly vicious creatures known as the Reavers . The Reavers are extremely dangerous folk , and I kinda liken them to Star Trek's Borg - they keep coming like zombies , and are known to rape and murder . The pacing is kept very tight , with witty dialogue flying all round . Humour is peppered throughout and you'll never know when it'll hit , even up to the very last frame ( no , I'm not kidding here ) . The production sets , though most are CGI , are really very pretty to look at , and the advanced world they live in , is an amalgamation of American and Chinese , so much so that the characters also spout ( sometimes intelligible ) Chinese phrases . There are memorable moments in the movie , though the action fights are quite ordinary , save for River's battle with the Reavers which seem to beat Aeon Flux's and Ultraviolet's hands down . Her storyline did thread very closely to resemble that of Leeloo's in Fifth Element though . Filled with deep characterization , Serenity will make you want to get your hands on the TV series to indulge in more adventures of the space crew . After watching this 2 hour movie , it's no wonder why Firefly has fast become a cult favourite . Too bad the movie didn't get a wide release locally ( only a GV Surprise Screening and another one-off at Prince ) , which will probably serve to extend its popularity here . Good , interesting Sci-Fi , must watch . Code 1 DVD comes chock full of extras . There's a full length feature film commentary by Joss Whedon , plenty of deleted scenes with Whedon's commentary , lots of outtakes , an laced - with-humour introduction by Whedon , three documentaries - 1 . Future History : The Story of Earth That Was , 2 . Re-lighting the Firefly , and 3 . What's in a Firefly , and an easter egg too , which showed the creation of that weird Fruity Oaty bar advertisement containing the sublime message ala The Manchurian Candidate .
514579	317399	461770	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Enchanted	How does she know , you love her ? Probably by bringing her to watch Enchanted , a movie with the words " chick flick " rubber stamped all over it . I've got to admit my friend offered to hook me up on a blind date with a hot chick because she wanted to watch this movie , and I had unsuccessfully persuaded him to bring her out on this movie date himself . Anyway if you're reading this , you should , because it has a winning formula ! The trailers would have suggested that this was going to be a madcap time , with a Disney movie poking fun at most of its classics , drawing inspiration from , and then taking a mickey out of it . You have a princess-wannabe Giselle ( Amy Adams ) , an animated character modeled quite generically from beauties like Snow White , Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty et al . Thrown in a Prince Charming named Edward ( James Marsden ) , and his evil stepmother The Queen ( Susan Sarandon ) , with evil hag disguise to boot . And with her greed to hold onto the Kingdom , she prevents the love-at-first-sight / song couple from marrying , and banishes Giselle to The Big Apple . With zero help and all the wrong moves and polite demeanor , she finds herself in the unlikely friendship of Robert Philip ( Patrick Dempsey ) and his daughter Morgan ( Rachel Covey ) . And here's when the movie starts to come alive with its inane scenes drawn from the Disney archives to bring on the chuckles , down to full blown musical numbers that are just plain charming . If Disney animated movies of yester-years have lovey dovey songs ( listen carefully to the background music to spot some recognizable Disney tunes ) , poisoned apples , dragons , henchmen , magic mirrors ( ha ! ) , witches , glass slippers , gorgeous costumes and cute furry animals , this movie has them all . But aside from the predictable elements that make a Disney cartoon a Disney cartoon , it boiled down to what's core in such fairy tales : True Love's Kiss . The one thing that every Disney female character yearn for from their hero . It's a typical fairy tale plot , but in its fish out of water storyline , it offered a clash of two different worldly views on the notion of love . For Giselle , it's always been happily ever afters after a shotgun meeting - boy meets girl , girl loves boy , they get married and live in a huge castle . In the real world we're so familiar with , Robert epitomizes the modern day notions of long drawn courtships , the trying to find out everything you can about the other half , for compatibility reasons , the contemplation whether you can live forever ( which is such a long time ) with the other half , and the option to divorce always hanging overhead when things don't work out . It's a clash of two different perspective from different worlds , and needless to say opposites do attract , henceforth providing a sort of dilemma as both parties are to be married to their respective partners . Amy Adams is Enchanted , without whom the movie will fall flat . She sings the songs , dances the joyous dance , squeals in delight at every new experience , and is the typical bambi-eyed beauty who finds positivity in everything , even when they are heading south . I guess I'm attracted to optimism , and no doubt , her character of hope had naturally struck a chord in me ( same thing goes for Kirsten Dunst's Claire in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown ) . When she opens her mouth and sings to invoke the innate powers of all Disney heroines , the ability to charm animals from afar to do her bidding , you've gotta see this one as it just cracks you up with the type of beings she conjures in New York . In her own ditzy manner , her Giselle will undoubtedly find a soft spot in your heart . Playing her two leading men are Patrick Dempsey as the world-weary divorce lawyer whose pessimism is soon to take an hard knock from Giselle's infectious attitude towards love , and James Marsden as the very himbo-like Prince Edward , all brawn , a naturally glib tongue , and perhaps a hint of an airhead ( Is it me , or are female characters these days becoming more Alpha-typed ? ) . Susan Sarandon got top billing too in this movie , and while she looks quite the part as the evil Queen , it's a pity that her screen time had been severely limited , lending more of her voice instead rather than appearing in the flesh . Throwaway characters include Timothy Spall as the no good henchman Nathaniel , and an animated chipmunk Pip ( noises by the director Kevin Lima himself in the NY version ) which seems to be the precursor to more of the same once Alvin and the Chipmunks hit the screen next month . In true Disney fashion , Enchanted goes back to basics with its message , that there must always be hope that one day you'll meet your true love , whether they drop in from the sky , or crawl out of the sewer . Almost a no-brainer choice for dating couples looking for fluffy chick flick entertainment .
515343	317399	1078188	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Boy	I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently - how convicted criminals , upon release from their jail term , attempt to re-integrate themselves back into society . With Little Children and The Woodsman , we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and non-forgiveness in the community they reside in . But what if this criminal is a killer ? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell , " Boy A " refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor . After serving significant time behind bars , we see him being released from prison , and working with his counsellor Terry ( Peter Mullan ) , he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge ( Andrew Garfield ) . This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background , but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers , or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served . But of course this is no action movie , so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run , with contract killers on the loose . What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig ( Taylor Doherty ) . And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max , where he constantly has to live a lie , and finds it extremely hard to work at , and obtain the trust of others , always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest , and with romance in the picture with Michelle ( Katie Lyons ) , it just complicates things . Fate allows him to redeem himself , but one wonders if that is enough , and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past . Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end , and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together , with the current timeline , and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time . We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality , and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim , but only through a fishing reference , which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime . Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well , being estranged from his wife , and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son . It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack , and how under his care or lackof , would develop inside each boy as the story went along . And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well , especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it , which just makes it a little bit more heart-wrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response , as if pre-emptive , and in the know . So , yellow ribbon project ? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself , and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis . Don't let this gripping drama slip you by , it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll .
515078	317399	51421	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sumpah Pontianak	Sumpah Pontianak is the third in a trilogy of Pontianak films directed by B Narayan Rao ( the first two being Pontianak , and Dendam Pontianak ) and starring Maria Menado in the title role . For the uninitiated , Pontianak is a female spirit whose powers are similar to a doppelganger , able to shift shape into various animals ( in this film , an owl ) , and of course , a beautiful woman . The movie , for the first time in those days filmed in CathayScope , opens smack in the middle of action ; Chomel laments her ill fate of being cursed to have the blood of Pontianak coursing through her veins , and a nail hammered into her neck by the villagers have rendered her powerless . Chomel has a daughter Maria ( not Menado by the way - another actress , Maria Menado plays Chomel the Pontianak ) who is married to the son of a village datok . Maria pines for her Ibu ( mother ) , and leaves the village , sparking a frantic search by her husband and his gang of comedic friends , who add humour and folk songs to the narrative . In other news , there are various mysterious deaths in a neighbourhood kampong , and all fingers point at Pontianak . There is nothing horrific about this show when viewed today , with Pontianak's rubbery face mask , with massive scarring , hooked nose , long and white ungainly hair , and two vicious stuck on fangs , and it didn't diminish the fun factor when watching the show . Many of the other monsters , like the cave savage ( bad makeup ) , and the Hantu Raya ( a zombie which can turn into a human sized bat complete with wings and the ability to fly ) are also made up similarly , but the bottomline is , it's real fun , and real cheesy . Pontianak plays like Frankenstein , one of its contemporaries in the 50s horror black and white movies , with the gathering of villagers / mobs in search of the monster with their torches and pitchforks / farm equipment , and of course , when chanced upon Pontianak herself , they will turn and run in all directions . However , in this film , Pontianak is not the villain , but rather the anti-heroine who must use her powers to defeat all evil doers and protect her daughter at the same time , who has a knack for getting herself into trouble . Sort of like Godzilla Vs ( whoever it is ) . For horror buffs who want to revisit the classical monsters of yesteryear , don't miss this one - it's a tale from this side of the world !
515472	317399	401445	8.0	A Nutshell Review : A Good Year	The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together , they made the award winning Gladiator , and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar . Here , they come together again for a pretty feel good movie , but I don't expect that this would win any major honours . Not that it's a bad film , but it's quite vanilla plain , that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold . Based on a book by Peter Mayle , A Good Year has plenty of life references to wine and vineyards , made as a comparison and reminder on how to live life . It's quite unlike Sideways , which was more of a road trip movie and had its plot revolve around wine . A Good Year has its revolve around an arse hole of a character , Maximillian Skinner ( Russell Crowe ) , the successful bond trader everyone loves to hate , given his ruthless knack on the trading bourses , and making loads of obscene money . So he learns that he had inherited a ch√¢teau in France , the same one he had spent his childhood ( little Max played by Freddie Highmore ) summer holidays in with his Uncle Henry ( Albert Finney ) , but instead the first thing that crosses his mind is , how much is it worth should he sell it ? It's a look at how you want to live life , making loads of money versus living it out with plenty of heart , and love . Love for the people who once made a difference to your life , and love and appreciation of life itself . Time to stop and smell the roses , versus the corporate rat race filled with backstabbing and office politics . And naturally when finding out about oneself , a look back at one's roots will always be a good way to start . There are a number of sub plots weaved into the movie , like the sudden appearance of a possible illegitimate cousin , Christie ( Abbie Cornish ) , who could complicate matters of inheritance , of the opposition of resident vineyard caretaker Francis ( Didier Bourdon ) , and of course , romance in the form of a feisty French woman Fanny ( Marion Cotillard ) , amongst others . There's also a bit about the different wine standards thrown in , which serves only to confuse , rudimentarily . There's a ring of familiarity to these characters , and at a glance , you would probably be able to guess the parts they play to develop the story , as do the little nagging business bits in the movie , but by making all these threads come together , and certain plot devices as well , only served to deliver up to expectations in an all's well that ends well . Some random thoughts - I loved the song by Alizee used in the movie , and quite surprised that it actually made it other than just be featured in the trailer . The movie also turned out to be quite the technological showcase , at least in the beginning , accompanying Max's progressive change . You have GPS , and almost an ad feel to Max's use of his PDA phone for calls , photo taking , the whole works . And if you think Crowe's outfits looked snazzy , yes , he's outfitted by Armani . The very first time I took notice of Russell Crowe , was when he played the villain in Virtuosity . Back then I thought that the guy had something going for him . And I've been convinced , having watched his last 6 movies , that he's a pretty fine actor , though his buffed and gruff demeanour had the tabloids highlighting his every shenanigan . Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore make a good pairing as well , given their limited screen time as the Uncle and his young nephew spending summer together . And don't get me started on the eye candy , who , well , remain eye candy for the most parts . A Good Year runs on an even keel , and feels light by the time it ends . Let's hope the next collaboration between Scott and Crowe in American Gangster , with the addition of Denzel Washington ( who played opposite Crowe in Virtuosity ) , will be something more explosive . " Winning's not everything , it's the only thing ! " - Maximillian Skinner
515263	317399	471834	8.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) NANA ( 2005 )	My curiosity was piqued when I saw many of the DVDs on sale at various shops recently , so was actually wondering what the movie's all about , until I chanced upon a copy ( Special Edition too ) at the Esplanade Library . In giving it a shot , I'm pleasantly surprised , at the story it told , as well as the eye-candy available of course . It contains an extremely strong story of friendship , of love and the falling out of , adapted from a popular Japanese manga of the same name , by Ai Yazawa . You might liken it to Feel 100 % , as it touches on life , romantic love , and friends . This is the story with a theme primarily centered on Fate , of how two strangers sharing the same name Nana , be the same age , come to meet one night on a train to Tokyo for their own personal reasons , and how they grow to be best friends . The two girls can be so different from each other , one being a kawaii ( cute ) bimbo , while the other is a rock chick ( which I thought was in the mould of Garbage's Shirley Manson ) with her own rock band called Black Stones . While the narrative is forward moving for Nana Komatsu ( Aoi Miyazaki ) , in following her objective to be in Tokyo with her boyfriend Shoji ( Yuuta Hiraoka ) , Nana Osaki ( Mika Nakashima , a real life singer ) is in the city to try and achieve her big break for the band . However , flashbacks and the slow revelation of Osaki's backstory too revealed a romantic tangle she had with an ex-band member Ren Honjou ( Ryuhei Matsuda ) , who now plays for a successful outfit called TRAPNEST . It's an account of the two Nana's romantic relationships with the guys in their lives , and how they encourage and support each other through turbulent times during the relationships . While Nana Osaki may be kawaii , her clingy puppy dog attitude may put some guys off , who might prefer the more confident Nana Osaki . But pride too is an obstacle , as I know from personal experience how two very ambitious persons can stumble unwittingly , and perhaps reluctantly sacrifice love for personal career . Before you dismiss this as a chick flick , I'd like to say I would think otherwise . It may look like one , but it's tremendously well made , with a well paced narrative . Perhaps having the manga serve as a source provided for richer characterization of the leads . The two actresses who play both Nanas too couldn't contrast each other perfectly , and all in all , it's a very pleasing , despite the down moments in the story , movie to watch . By the way , the sequel has already been filmed , and is pending a year end release . I don't suppose we'll get the opportunity to see it in the theatres here , so will have to cross my fingers for a quick DVD release . This Code 3 DVD Special Edition by Panorama Entertainment comes with 2 discs . The first contains the movie and a full length commentary by director Kentaro Otami as well as the two lead actresses Mika Nakashima and Aio Miyazaki . Listening to them during the commentary , they revealed which shots were kept close to the manga source , and which had to be changed for reasons ranging from aesthetics to form . No worries though , as the commentary comes with subtitles as well , in both English ( though there were some grammar / tense issues with " shotted " ) and Chinese . Audio comes in a Dolby Digital 5 . 1 , which allows for a truly rock-concert like atmosphere during scenes when the bands perform . The second disc is the feature disc , consisting of - Making of NANA , ( 33mins 25s ) , follows the production from the 15-16 Jan 05 when filming began , including the director and cast interviews , as well as deleted scenes ( filmed but not used in the movie ) - Premiere Screening in Japan , 7 July ( for obvious reasons ) 2005 ( 3mins 10s ) , in Rippongi , with the director and major casts sharing their thoughts on the movie and of the characters they play . - Stage Appearance in Japan , 3 Sep 2005 , ( 3mins 55s ) with the director and major casts sharing their thoughts of the movie again . - Asia Premiere in Hong Kong , on 2 Oct 2005 ( 4mins ) , with a press conference attended by director Kentaro Otani , Mika Nakashima and Ryuhei Matsuda , and the attendance at the premiere screening complete with a cosplay contest . - Four theatrical trailers , without subtitles ( Runtimes of 1min 48s , 30s , 20s , 34s ) - Four TV Spots , without subtitles ( Runtimes of 17s , 17s , 30s , 17s )
515360	317399	386032	8.0	A Nutshell Review : SiCKO	Won't we like to visit a doctor , and be provided preventive advice during a regular checkup . Or how about instead of worrying just how much those consultation charges are going to be , we get a world class doctor who basically just cares and is genuinely concerned with our well-being , and getting us cured of our sickness ? That's the kind of feeling you get when watching Michael Moore's latest documentary SiCKO . While he rages on and uncovers the deficiencies in the US healthcare system , he waxes lyrical about the free healthcare systems of various countries , while at the same time , comparing how doctors under different systems fare . We all know that doctors make a lot of money , but some make a lot of money because they are specialists and charge sky high fees for their services , that you can't help but wonder if it's money over patients . Then again , in what is termed the socialist medicine model , where doctors are akin to civil servants , being paid a fixed salary with variable components tagged to the welfare of the patients , you wonder too if that is probably a better system altogether , that those genuinely want to heal people , get into the profession , and those who want to make money , well , go work at the pharmaceutical companies . In any case , Moore dresses his documentary up in his usual sexy manner . He again drums up and creates a rally behind his objectives , and it's easy to fall prey to his viewpoint . There are merits to the better models he presented , or how non profit organizations , for the love of healing folks , can come up with 24hr on-call services , truly making healthcare not only affordable , but within physical reach . And he contrasts this with the cold , calculated way in which Americans are treated . And there's the flaw with privatizing healthcare , leaving it into the hands of , god forbid , insurance companies . It's almost common sense that premiums are always easy to pay , provided you satisfy many of the pre-conditions , but when it comes to the claim , that's where the real problem starts , as you'd come to expect delays , challenges , combing the fine print for some ambiguous clause just to starve you off any legitimate payback . I seriously hope we don't get our monies trapped in such schemes ( ahem , annuities ? ) . And when we're talking about life and death , it's ideal to leave little room for contracts and negotiations - life takes priority . In that sense where security and education comes into play , we leave it to the powers that be , and shouldn't healthcare be so as well ? Short of labelling it as the restriction of freedom and choice as some would have it argued , it actually comes with widespread social acceptance , and of course , taxes . You must be willing to pay to receive subsidized , or even free benefits . Otherwise , where do all these funds come from ? And this is where Moore conveniently skips , or mentions in extremely brief passing . There's no such thing as a free lunch , though neither is it a zero sum game , and there will be two sides carved out - those who just want to enjoy the benefits without contributing to it , and those who resent paying for someone else's welfare . Not everyone can be like the Canadians : ) Different strokes for different folks , depending on which set of values one subscribes to . So as Moore uncovers ideal benefits in the healthcare systems in the UK , France , Canada and even Cuba , he doesn't address the other social ills and resentment that comes along with it . But of course , since this is a documentary , and naturally the points that make the final cut must all support the filmmaker's vision . If compared to his earlier works , SiCKO comes across as more mature though , with its sexy arguments made against a very serious presentation and tone , void of all the quirky animations , and have rather limited snark remarks , not that they're not present . But the best bits about it , is how he pieces together the corruption in the whole system , including those in seats of power . As we know , some politicians can be persuaded with funds to assist in their respective lobbies , and it is no surprise where these healthcare insurance companies put their money on . Politicians on payrolls , in a nice way , are nothing new . And seriously , nobody can fault a private enterprise into achieving its prime objective in a market economy , and that is to maximize profits . Money can be used to cover the heart and soul , so why not use it to an advantage . SiCKO is crafted shrewdly in the hands of Moore , and frankly , brought its points out rather well . The much anticipated Guantanamo Bay excursion though was much ado about nothing , given the widespread publicity of the potential trouble Moore might get into . But the real gem of the movie though , is the lesson on how to shape one's arguments - place incessant focus on the good parts to debunk what currently doesn't work , because the bigger picture will always be able to puncture arguments presented within a 2 hour picture . It's never easy to find a right balance for any social issue , or life for that matter . I just have to make sure , as I told a friend , that I have a plan on what to do if I'm diagnosed with a serious condition , given rising health care costs here as well . And by the looks of it increasing in time to come , the plan definitely includes the reluctance to line the coffers of the doc treating me .
515141	317399	448011	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Knowing	It's been quite a while since Alex Proyas was at the helm of a film , the last being I , Robot back in 2004 where he adapted Isaac Asimov's science fiction classic of the same name . He continues to dwell in the sci-fi realm again with Knowing , with leading man Nicolas Cage plucked from his National Treasure roots because his character here , MIT professor John Koestler , follows in the tradition of running around everywhere in search for answers and the truth . A widower , John's world consists of his estranged parents , sister Grace ( Nadia Townsend ) who pops by his home every now and then to check up on him , and his son Caoeb ( Chandler Canterbury ) , and if this was a film other than sci-fi , you would've suspected that there's some incestuous relationship between John and Grace being suggested at , which I thought Proyas had failed in toning the downright awkward looks they are passing at each other . But what Proyas succeeded , was the crafting of great atmosphere in keeping you guessing along with the characters , building up tension when necessary , but being succinctly to the point without dragging it out when it served no more purpose . It starts in the 50s where a time capsule is being assembled and the students are tasked to draw a picture each of what they perceive as the future . A girl who has been acting strangely had listed down a whole page of seemingly random numbers , which her teacher abruptly took from her to be sealed into the capsule . Fast forward to today , and it's preordained that Caleb would be the recipient of that strange sheet of numbers , which he brings home and John begins to decipher it while high on alcohol , only to discover that there's a pattern to those randomness , and so begins the quest in search for the truth , hunting down that little girl's offspring Diana ( Rose Byrne ) in between running from a handful of beings who seem to only want to communicate with children . There's this very strong theme running through the movie about randomness versus decisiveness , with one camp believing that everything's an independent development from one another , rather than a sequence already determined and laid out . It's like destiny , whether one has the option and choice to change it , or just perceived to have the ability to do so without any to begin with . When the numbers finally revealed themselves to mean something , could anything be done to prevent some of them from happening , leading to the ultimate event that seemed like a page out of the Book of Revelations . It too served as a cautionary environmental warning , though only fleetingly , in telling us how important the ozone layer is to our world , without which we would find ourselves in some really deep trouble . I suppose Proyas continues to be bitten by the special effects bug , given some groundbreaking CGI some many years back , which continue to be dabbled in and employed for this film , accentuating three key action sequences that would make any disaster movie feel envious . I've always been in awe at Final Destination's airplane disaster and that from Kairo / Pulse , but the catastrophe here upped the ante for the next film to follow suit , given a perfect continuous single take that deserves a second viewing . And the disasters shown here , no doubt only possible through CGI , puts one in the driver's seat and gives you a first person's perspective in how one would bear witness to such events , should one be there and then at the site . Nothing less than jawbreaking , I tell you , as it doesn't flinch from its intended violence , nor gratuitously glorifying such moment . It's been a while since we've seen a thinking man version of an action flick such as Deep Impact , and Knowing firmly rests with that film in being one amongst those that socks it right into your emotional core . Science fiction fans may be apprehensive after Hollywood's last big budgeted flick with The Day The Earth Stood Still , but Knowing comes definitely recommended and surpasses the former in almost every aspect .
514632	317399	765429	9.0	A Nutshell Review : American Gangster	Ridley Scott's American Gangster has many similar parallels to Derek Yee's Prot√©g√© , in that it's a story about the scourge of drugs , and each containing the respective insights into the entire production , processing and distribution processes , stemming again from material sources in South East Asia . While the latter is a fictional account , American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas ( Denzel Washington ) , the black drug lord whose meteoric rise to power was deemed incredulous because of race and colour , and the story of the detective Richie Roberts ( Russell Crowe ) whose team had broken through the complex web of mon dealings to take down the gangsters , as well as their corrupt own . This epic movie , clocking in at slightly more than 2 . 5 hours , takes its time to tell the respective stories , which on their own could be standalone equivalents , no doubt boosted by the powerhouse performances by award winning actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe , who is into his third collaboration with Ridley after movies like Gladiator and A Good Year . While the story may seem straight-forward without any spectacular twists and turns , it's based solely on the credible performances as well as the re-creation of the late 60s-early 70s environment of New York , where blatant corruption seemed to be the norm of the day . Crowe's Richie perhaps have the lesser screen time of the two , like an Elliot Ness equivalent in being the incorruptible cop in a corrupt force , whose reputation of turning in a million dollars instead of pocketing it , preceded him . This made him an automatic choice in creating his own squad of Untouchables , assembling a team of similarly principled men to work outside the system , to go after the big fish . While his boy scout character might seem boring , here's where the script by Steven Zaillian adds a little flavour in throwing in shades of grey . While Richie is honest to his job , a little examination into his private life has him being quite the ladies ' man , as well as struggling with his estranged wife to fight for custody of their child . Washington's Frank Lucas on the other hand , had the meat , given after all the movie is about the crime lord . The first hour charted his rise and it is the buildup that makes this movie so compelling as it tapers toward the inevitable finale , as you discover how deep the rot of corruption is , and having links to the Vietnam War and the army . His " Blue Magic " heroin product sells for half the price and double the potency as middlemen are cut off , and shipment is relatively free - I'd dare say this is ingenious , and makes a monkey out of the authorities . And it is his segment that proved to be more interesting of the two - OK , so everyone would like to know how he did what he did , versus a straight cop's quest to putting away those involved with the entire business . There were many fine points made especially for those who are in the business of being crooked . If you notice all the high profile corporate fraud cases , most are done in because money corrupts one into an opulent lifestyle , bringing uncalled for attention to oneself . Here , Lucas ' principle is similar , to keep a low profile , but alas everyone has their moment of oversight and carelessness . To continue my admiration of the guy's work ethics , and probably because of the nature of the business , no one is trusted except for family . I guess a crime family is easier to raise since blood is supposedly more trustworthy than random hired hands . While we see Richie's assembly of a few good men for his cause of righteousness , we also witness the creation of a mob family from scratch , but as we all know , time will tell if the kinks within the family can be worked out , or go against the ruler with an iron fist . Scott somehow seemed to emphasize family for a fair bit , with periodic shots for comparison put side by side for the audience to form their conclusions . Don't be expecting any major scenes of killing , choosing instead to be based on powerful dialogue as the gun battles here are few and far between , usually over as quickly as they start because Frank Lucas doens't fall into the usual fictional villains ' lapse into monologues . The action sequences might be few , but they are sure pack their punch despite their short duration . Everything's paced rather nicely , and I particularly enjoyed the entire buildup , though the ending felt a little rushed because there are little that could be elaborated at that point . Fans of Denzel and Russell who want to see these two strong actors share the same screen / scene , will be a tad disappointed , as they do so only toward the finale , lasting no more than 10 minutes , but those turn out to be the gem they were , so savour every moment of it properly . The second mobster movie this week , it's a difficult toss up between Ridley Scott's American Gangster and David Cronenberg's Eastern PRomises . If you're tired of blood and gore with a twist , and would prefer something based on a true story told in a more straightforward manner , then American Gangster will be your choice . IF I may say , there's nothing really spectacular about the plot , but it works , thanks to Ridley Scott's confident direction , and the A-plus performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe .
515187	317399	217505	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Gangs of New York	I guess the one thing on everyone's mind about the show , just what is so NC about the NC-16 rating that is slapped on this movie currently screening in local theatres Your search is over , here are the answers : 1 . The bloody opening gang fight , which one suspects has been snipped at some points ever so carefully by the censors 2 . There is a nightclub scene which has prostitutes baring their chests 3 . In that scene they smoke opium 4 . Sorry guys , you do not see Ms Diaz exposed ala Halle Berry in NC-16 Swordfish Synopsis OK , now to the movie proper , just 4 words : Daniel Day-Lewis Rocks . If you think that is 3 words , you're just being petty . The first 10 minutes of raw gang power's the best thing in the show , other than that . . . sad to say , there ain't no more of an all out gang war despite the rebuilding of The Dead Rabbits . The plot is choppy at times , probably because the show had to be cut down to a more butt-tolerable length of 169mins . The Good Leo Di Caprio's Amsterdam resurrects The Dead Rabbits . Hmm . . . that good ? : P The Bad Daniel " Bill The Butcher " Day-Lewis ' moustache is bad @ ss ! The Ugly Yup , lotsa ugly extras in the show : P What are you waiting for , move your butt and hit the theatres , now !
514609	317399	388795	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Brokeback Mountain	Here's my challenge : Watch Casanova and Jarhead ( both now showing in local theaters ) before watching Brokeback Mountain , to appreciate and to keep fresh in your mind , the acting range of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal . One plays a king of lovemaking , while the other plays an army grunt , in which both are alpha-males roles . Then when you watch Brokeback Mountain , you'll probably be wide-eyed at how these two have a go at each other . Based upon the 1997 short story by Edna Anne Proulx , you must have your head stuck in mud if you're not aware this movie is about two cowboy shepherds who share a relationship up in the mountains of Brokeback . Set in 1963 , we see Ennis Del Mar ( Ledger ) and Jack Twist ( Gyllenhaal ) team up in their job to shepherd sheep to graze , and having strict orders to be separate most times to take care of their flock . But being together alone in the mountains , sharing their lives with each other , brings them too close , and soon , they share a forbidden illicit relationship ( hey , they're supposed to be macho cowboys , and it's the 60s of free love and Vietnam looming ) that transcends the usual boundaries of male bonding . It's like a summer love , and after an hour into the film , we explore how this love affect them as they try to ease themselves back to normalcy . Except that things are never going to be normal anymore . While they establish families - Del Mar with his be-throed Alma ( Michelle Williams ) , and Twist with rich Lureen Newsome ( Anne Hathaway in another role which she shows off her assets ) , they cannot forget their throes of passion they had sparked back in summer of 63 . Before long , they get together again to reignite their passion for each other and continue over a period of 20 years . One thing's for sure , the story will still play out decently if you substitute gay love with heterosexual roles , like the countless of movies on cheating spouses , but there'll be a very distinct lack of punch . You'll notice that the male couples share similar trials and tribulations of any relationship - the love , passion , how much one party is willing to give the other , and how much the other will reciprocate , and unfulfilled dreams . What gives this movie the edge is how the characters are compelled to look for each other for solace , and the deceit and lies they have to go through in order to be together . It's a movie that's paced slowly , but gives opportunity for the audience to admire the postcard perfect ( CGI-enhanced ) landscape of the mountains and plains , to study the expressions of the characters , to listen and ponder upon the dialog . Lee Ang had made Chinese Wu-Xia movies sexy , and it's no wonder that he has also managed to add a touch of sensuality that permeates throughout Brokeback . The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack helps too in keeping the mood and emotions in check , serving to add to the narrative in periods of silenced dialog . Perhaps something which I thought was pretty neat , was the idea brought forward from Kinsey , that there is a degree of homosexuality in all of us , and it depends on how gay you are , or have the courage , to come out of the closet . What's interesting is when you think about whether the notion of gayness stems from nature , or nurture . If you'd seen the movie , you'll know what I'm talking about , and how passion can consume someone , that it takes over all sensibility , and about the propensity of risk you're willing to take . Heath Ledger had a pretty busy 2005 , with diverse roles in Brothers Grimm , Lords of Dogtown , Casanova and this . I've seen all of them , and while I disliked Grimm , I thought his roles in 2005 should be credited with an Oscar win for this . Jake Gyllenhaal too plays Twist with a touch of machoness , and yet is able to slip back into needy whining gentleness with a flick of a switch . Michelle Williams ' role , while small , is accentuated by the particular one scene in which she discover the truth . It is powerful - nothing much said , but everything said through the eyes . Perhaps the weakness link is Hathaway with her megawatt smile and bimbotic blonde looks , as the clueless wife of Twist caught in between some major family squabbles . Homophobes will probably give this movie a miss , but to generally brand this as a gay movie will be missing the point . I'd recommend it to everyone I know to watch this with an open mind . It's an out-and-out dramatic story on relationships , and it's classic storytelling at its best , with excellent acting and strong direction , cinematography , heck , this movie deserves its 8 Academy nominations , so let's see it take home some honors ( I'm not sticking my neck out just yet , until I watch all the other contenders ) . P . S . Yes , this movie is shown here uncut . If you're not celebrating this movie , at least celebrate the fact that we can get to watch it here as it is intended to be .
515577	317399	401997	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Breach	Breach is directed by Billy Ray , who also wrote Flightplan and directed his only other movie , Shattered Glass , also based on real events . Based on the true story of the greatest security breach in US History , it traces the events leading to the arrest of decorated and respected FBI agent Robert Hanssen , who is one heck of a mole within the organization , committing treason of the highest order by betraying the country and selling secrets to the Soviet Union . FBI newbie Eric O'Neill ( Ryan Philippe ) gets assigned as an undercover within his own organization , in order to bring down what could possibly be the most difficult inside man to nab , because of his numerous years of field experience , and expertise . Robert Hanssen ( Chris Cooper ) on the surface appears to be stoic , no nonsense , and a God fearing man , but underneath the facade lies something more sinister , and Eric is assigned to obtain proof and evidence in order to charge Hanssen , rather than based on the evidence already gathered which would only garner him a few years imprisonment . It's spy versus spy , mole infiltration and family misunderstandings revisited again , as Eric has to deal with convincing his boss Hanssen that he is trustworthy , and to maintain that trustworthiness with his wife , who has absolutely no idea how sensitive her husband's involvement in the investigations is , and therefore a sore point conflicting with his mission . For those into spy thrillers , you'll need some patience as the movie takes its time to set up the kill . However , it's a pleasure just watching it develop every step of the way , despite knowing its outcome , and that there is no big bang exaggerated set action piece . It's an intellectual mindfield for Eric to tread , on one hand feeling extremely beholden and admiring Hanssen , yet on the other , having to snoop everything and report back to his bosses , for that hazy " for the good of everyone " mission objective . Chris Cooper gave a superb performance as the charismatic Robert Hanssen , while fielding deep dark undertones within his character . I liked the front bit where he mentors his " clerk " Eric , with full ego and cockiness of a veteran , explaining the bit about turf protection , office politics within the Bureau and inter-agency rivalry . Ryan Philippe managed to hold his own against Cooper , and was believable as the man tasked to bring down a veteran - you can feel his adrenaline rush when assigned the mission , yet sympathize with his apprehensions each step of the way . Laura Linney unfortunately played only a bit role as the direct supervisor for Eric's mission , and provided at times some light hearted moments as she exasperates over Eric's many decisions and pointed questions . There's a degree of added authenticity with the real Eric O'Neill serving as special consultant to the movie . So if spy thrillers are your cup of tea , then Breach will definitely not disappoint . Make time for this !
514384	317399	387131	9.0	A Nutshell Review : The Constant Gardener	Finally ! After such a long wait , this movie has finally made it to our shores ( I have been lamenting the same fate of other acclaimed movies recently ) . Directed by Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles ( who did City of God ) , The Constant Gardener finds itself sandwiched between two others movies released here in the same period , sharing with North Country an aspect about whistle-blowing , and with Syrianna on the corruption of conglomerates . While Syrianna takes on oil corporations , Gardener tells a tale of clandestine governments , and the morality issues faced by pharmaceutical companies . Adapted from the novel by John le Carr√© , Gardener explores and suggests what-if scenarios ( I say " what-if " as I humbly ask if what was suggested by the film could have been inspired by some form of real happenings ) , of having human guinea pigs in the testing of new medicine . In contention here is a new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis , though HIV was also briefly sharing the spotlight in the plight of the African nations . The stark question posed , which makes you wonder , is whether it is right to have dying Africans , or those who are already terminally ill , test new medicine , and presenting to them Hobson's choice . And Kenya was the choice location in the movie , with having both the hustle and bustle of the cities , and the lush desert plains both beautifully captured on film . While you feel the chaos in the cities and rural squatters in rusty brown hues , you'll also feel the peacefulness and emptiness of vast lands . You'll contrast the corruption of officials of the Haves in their cocktail parties , and the simple , poor lives of the Have Nots . Ralph Fiennes puts up an excellent performance as Justin Quayle , a British diplomat in Her Majesty's Service . It's indeed a surprise exclusion in the Academy for his portrayal of an easy going man with green fingers ( hence The Gardener ) . His mantra is to mind his own business and not get too involved with the locals , but as the movie evolves , we will see a change in this stand . However it calls to mind certain issues that again will set you thinking - if you want to help , how much and how far will you go ? And why a certain group , and not others in similar situations ? Resources will be your constraint , but what is the criteria in which you will base your decisions on ? Now that you're made aware , will you still continue to turn the blind eye ? His spouse Tessa Quayle is played by Rachel Weisz , whom I'm not sure why her performance , while solid , is nothing to warrant a shout for an Academy nomination . Nonetheless , she's the center of the entire scheme of things , and her story gets mainly told in flashbacks . A whistle-blower definitely ruffles feathers , and you know you're in a fix when you ruffle the feathers of the wrong bird . Extremely blunt and determined ( and also giving the filmmakers an opportunity to air their opinion on the Iraqi war ) , she discovers that there's more than meets the eye in the way medicine is dispensed to the African poor , and sets off on a crusade in which the means could justify the ends . But we slowly learn and unravel the mystery of what happened , and who's involved , as the Gardener takes us on his trail of investigation , digging through clues , and weeding out red herrings , piecing together the entire event . It is the film editing here which gets the thumbs up . Just as you accept something at face value , there is enough suggestion again to make you think otherwise . In case you're wondering if the meandering narrative or themes will put you off , you might be glad to know that central throughout the movie is the love between the couple . How so much unsaid , and circumstances not explain could lead to suspicion , or deliberately done so to protect the other . Although the leads spend considerable time apart , we could feel , especially from Justin , the strong emotional attachment he has for Tessa , right up until the ending , which is just about right in the way it should end . It's a wonderful film , one in which you'd have to stay attentive to truly appreciate , and one which prods at your conscience . Given it's insane release schedule together with Walk the Line , Jarhead , Syrianna , and with North Country and Match Point already screening , we're indeed spoilt for choice which to watch first . I'd say watch them all !
515038	317399	460989	9.0	A Nutshell Review : The Wind That Shakes the Barley	The preview for this movie played to a full house at Picturehouse , no doubt with almost half those in attendance being Caucasians , and I'd bet almost everyone is curious to the pedigree of Ken Loach's latest film that snagged that Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival . The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a mouthful , and it plays like a thinking man's Braveheart . While Mel Gibson's Academy Award winner was set in the 13th Century with the Scots battling the English for independence , Wind tackles similar subject matter about oppression , the rallying to arms and the battle for independence , set in early 20th Century in Ireland , sandwiched between the two World Wars . As such , there are many parallels between the movies in terms of the politics behind the scenes , the arguments for and against their rationale of armed resistance and struggle , though Wind doesn't have the large scaled set action pieces for war , and it doesn't need to . It takes a very intimate look at the historical background of the Irish Republican Army , as seen through the eyes of two brothers Damien ( Cillian Murphy ) and Teddy ( Padraic Delaney ) . The movie doesn't waste time in establishing a rather biased fact , that the English troops are despised for their arrogance and the crimes that they commit among commonfolk , much like the Robin Hood days . It doesn't take two ticks for Damien to enlist with the IRA for their armed struggle against oppression witnessed by many , and soon enough they discover that their political ideals differ . Yes , it's as much a talkie movie as it is one with action . Even without background of the politics of the time , you'll still be able to follow through much of the debate given passionate performances , and fiery speeches made from the heart , given the universal subject themes . As always the case , differing ideals become the crux of the issue , and that adage that power corrupts ring through , especially amongst those at the top echelons , the politicians versus the man on the street . What I thought was intriguing , was how freedom was negotiated , as a compromise rather that complete , yet with plans in the backburner on going against such agreements when one becomes more powerful - the classical giving an inch and taking a yard , when the time is correct , with a powerful base to work from . Cillian Murphy gives yet another commendable performance as Damien , a freedom fighter ( or terrorist , depending on how you see it ) fighting for the injustice he experiences and observes . Padraic Delaney too holds his own as Teddy the brother , and the two cannot be more different , especially when they stand for the same ideals , disagreeing on execution . One's an idealist , while the other doesn't mind compromise , but both share extreme pain in doing what they deem morally right . Despite Spider-man's much awaited sequel making its debut worldwide this week , Wind is one movie that I'll recommend if summer blockbuster's aren't your cup of tea . Highly recommended .
514547	317399	105654	9.0	A Nutshell Review : The Tune	This is a story about a song writer called Del ( voiced by Daniel Nieden ) , who's working on the latest hit for his boss , Mr Mega ( Marty Nelson ) . However he's suffering from creator's block , and couldn't find the inspiration to finish the tune . At the same time , his relationship with Mr Mega's secretary , Didi ( Maureen McElheron ) , may start to fall apart should he not be able to complete the tune , and this just adds to the pressure . What follows is something like an adventure in Alice's Wonderland , as Del , en route to submitting his incomplete work to Mr Mega , finds himself on the wrong end of a highway , and gets transported to the extremely weird world of Flooby Nooby , where it seems like everyone is able to hold their own tune . The secret of course is to write from the heart , and he embarks on this quest within Flooby Nooby to learn just how to do that . There are more than 10 songs featured in the movie , which just gets better and better with each song being played , ranging from pop to folk and even the blues . The songs are naturally the highlight of an animated film hinging on them , and Maureen McElheron certainly created the tunes that combined perfectly with Bill Plympton's visuals . Del encounters different folks with different strokes , and I'm still in awe at the immense creativity that Bill Plympton has featured in the characters of this movie . Infusing great humour , there are plenty of mini episodes which could stand alone as comedic animated shorts , like the two violent men , the sad story of a taxi driver , and of course my personal favourite , probably the precursor to The Matrix Reloaded's Architect in the Wiseone ( Chris Hoffman ) . What's amazing too is the different animation styles adopted by Plympton within the film , and truly , this is great stuff . You have animators who , after discovering a style they're comfortable with , sticks to it and you can see the style replicated in their drawings . Plympton's so diverse , you can hardly classify his works as they are extremely wide-ranged . The shorts who have provided this hint , but I didn't expect him to combine the styles into one coherent feature length movie so seamlessly . Before the screening began , Bill Plympton shared with the audience that The Tune costed around US$150-175K in those days , and it took him about two and a half years to make the film . You see , rarely does the creator animate his own stuff , but Bill probably is the first who did it , for a feature length animation . Though he prefers to admit that he's not too diligent and likes to spend time travelling , which of course , adds to the production schedule . He's been able to recoup the cost of production only recently , thanks to the advent of technology like the Internet and DVD sales . He also shared that his stuff is wildly popular in Korea , that it is a huge market for him . And for budding animators , his advice would be to own their own creations . When asked a question about opportunity cost between working independently , and for a studio / production house , he highlighted his preference for having the creative freedom to do what he wants , instead of having someone else provide the directions and nagging if something is too politically incorrect or too violent .
514688	317399	47821	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Le Amiche	Lorenzo Codelli introduced this film as the only real literary adaptation by Michelangelo Antonioni , based on a short novel written by Cesare Pavese , whose short life but impressive career had a largely influential impact on Antonioni's works . It's a film about women ( the literal translation of the title of the story " Tra Donne Sole " means " Between Women Only " ) , in today's context known as the career girls , and it's also interesting to note that the co-writers of the screenplay were both female , each on opposite ends of the literary spectrum , one a " low-brow " pulp novelist , the other a " high-brow " writer . And I guess this pairing provided a very complete and enjoyable story which in today's contemporary context would classify if as a chick flick , only that this had plenty of intelligence and a lot of heart , and doesn't come across as a dumbed down condescending story with many cardboard characters thrown in just because . Opening with a sprightly tune , and set in Turn , La Amiche has plenty of insights into the female psyche , and I am quite surprised that it had stood the test of time ( more than 50 years ! ) to be as relevant today just as it was back in the mid-50s . The story follows Clelia ( Eleonara Rossi Drago ) from Rome , sent to Turin to supervise the setting up of a fashion boutique branch , and in her temporary stay at the city , befriends a group of high-society and debatable successful ladies through the attempted suicide of one of their clique members Rosetta ( Madeleine Fischer ) , who was found in her adjoining hotel room . From there we examine all their love lives , their work attitudes , their relationships with one another , the entire spectrum which while presenting themselves as little gossipy episodes that women might be prone to ( I'm readying myself to be pelted with rotten tomatoes with that statement ) , it always felt that each individual piece was a perfect contribution to the entirety of the movie , with nary a wasted scene , nor unnecessary subplots provided just to bloat the story . Antonioni has proved his deftness at handling an ensemble of characters ( much unlike his earlier movies , or his famed Trilogy where only a handful of characters get explored ) like the de-facto leader of the group Momina De Stefani ( Yvonne Fumeaux ) whose rich husband being always away on business provides her with an avenue for affairs and the need for constant emotional connection , or what I thought was the more interesting of the lot , was between successful ceramics artist Nene ( Valentina Cortese ) and her less successful painter fianc√© Lorenzo ( Gabriele Ferzetti ) , who becomes romantically linked to Rosetta after painting her portrait , or rather , it was Rosetta who throws herself at him . Completing the group is Mariella ( Anna Maria Pancani ) , a flighty flirty woman with a devil-may-care attitude . For some reason I was concentrating on the Lorenzo-Nene-Rosetta story , because it was quite compelling to see how it played out and developed , having one of them throw the first salvo at attempted suicide . It also provided a platform to examine how relationships can be strained possibly through emotions like jealousy and one being envious of the other's success , and maybe taking it out on the person through other means , such as the breaking of hearts . Again like Story of a Love Affair ( I have no idea why I keep going back to this ) it was a similar situation presented , though more explicitly presented rather than leaving it to second guesses . The confrontational scene between Nene and Rosetta was the best in the movie in my opinion , and one of the best I have seen in movies where rival lovers have to confront each other on the truth of the situation , and you can hear the unbelievable groans of an audience upon its resolution , which was quite pathetic and awkwardly delivered , by today's standards . Which is what was intriguing , as it highlighted the perceived role of a woman back then , that the career first mindset was still a novelty , and standing behind your man was possibly the only acceptable societal norm . And it is this forward-thinking presentation and exploration of modern day themes even by today's standards , that make La Amiche a winner , being still relevant and all . Having 5 girls presented allowed for some comparisons over how some choose love over career despite expected setbacks which come part and parcel with it , and how some choose career over love , where one can excel in without the distractions of disappointment from the heart . Included as well is work ethics , when one doesn't have money as a prime motivator , one would wonder how the other non-tangible benefits would appeal to workers who have to turn up at work everyday , versus coming and going as they please , which I have experienced for myself ( as on the receiving end of having to manage the non-attendance of others ) . Other moments in the film that were equally enjoyable , include the fashion runway type shows in the old days , without the runway of course , where models have to present the clothes up close and personal in a closed door , intimate setting within the fashion boutique . And what was probably a precursor to the beach scene in L'Avventura get played out here , though it was a location for the rich folks to just stand around and flirt , with no real plan for a weekend getaway . It's still amazing how this particular little setting seem to squeeze so much into it , providing a catalyst for future incidents to burst out from . Le Amiche will go down in my books as a story starring women , about women and for women that is still highly relevant in today's society . It has withstood the test of time perfectly , and its exploration of women , their relationships , their attitudes that differ depending on either their single or married status , is an amalgamation of keen observations that make this an enjoyable a must-watch , peppered with good punctuations of humour throughout .
515085	317399	416212	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Secret Life of Bees	It's been two years since we last saw Dakota Fanning on the big screen here , in a film which was a adaptation of the literary classic Charlotte's Web . And what a career it had been for this child actress , now an adolescent , to have grown from scream queen ( no thanks to her stint under Spielberg's War of the Worlds ) to one controversial role in Hounddogs , which I doubt would make it to our shores here . Based on a novel by Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood , The Secret Life of Bees is one powerful drama above love and the looking for love , as well as running along the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation . It's easy to dismiss this as a chick flick because of its predominantly female cast , but that would be a mistake to make in making it an excuse to miss this film altogether . For all its worth , it's chock full of extremely well delivered performances from veterans such as Fanning herself , together with Queen Latifah , Jennifer Hudson ( proving that she's no flash in the pan ) , Sophie Okonedo , Paul Bettany and even Alicia Keys ! Set in the time of Summer in 1964 Southern USA where the Civil Rights Act was just signed and in effect , the sentiments amongst the racist bigots still run high in a charged environment still hanging onto their old segregated ways . Fanning's Lily Owens carries the weight of her guilt buried deep in her subconscious from a tragic event that happened when she was four , and ten years later , after receiving the last straw of punishment from her abusive dad ( Bettany ) , runs away with her caretaker Rosaleen ( Hudson ) . As if led by an invisible hand , they soon find themselves under the extreme goodwill of the Boatwright sisters , who earn a living through the cultivation of bees for honey , and a series of incidents that bring about some tying of loose ends , and the discovery that these strangers do tie back to Lily's own quest to finding out the truth about her mom , to debunk the lies as told by her father . And of course this allows opportunity for some serious girl power bonding between the characters as they find that they have a lot more in common , as well as the sharing and spreading of love through their ranks . The trump card that this movie has , is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast . Fanning leads the pack and gives a wonderful moving performance as the gangling Lily , who thinks that she's quite a jinx with plenty of bad karma to go around , bringing about unfortunate happenings to her hosts which provide the dramatic twists and turns to what would otherwise be a flat movie . Jennifer Hudson had much to do in the first act , though her character got quite muted by the time the trio of the Boatwright sisters August ( Latifah ) , June ( Keys ) and Okonedo ( May ) come along . Queen Latifah brings about some serious gravitas in her role as the eldest with the largest heart , and you cannot deny her chemistry with Fanning . Keys on the other hand plays the sister the exact opposite of August , being aloof and starting off with intense suspicion as to the intent of their guests . And Okonedo's role could probably be the most unorthodox of the lot , a fragile soul who has her own wailing wall to deal with the harsh realities of life . The Secret Life of Bees is well worth the admission ticket , and you'll be hard pressed not to be touched by the film , or moved by the themes it explores , especially when the third act comes by leading to quite a number of powerful revelations and a solid conclusion . Set against its intended backdrop , it's a reminder of tolerance , which the world lacks these days , and of course it's not always hammering in such heavy themes as it has its fair share of romance as well , and for what it's worth , Fanning has her first on-screen romance in this movie , and if I'm right , has her first on-screen kiss as well . You might be surprised when I say this , but this film has won me over enough for it to be considered as a contender when I shortlist my list of ten top films of the year . Definitely recommended !
515090	317399	1330607	10.0	A Nutshell Review : If You Are The One	I'm a keen admirer of versatile Chinese director Feng Xiaogang and am a fan of his films , which covers quite a vast range from War ( The Assembly ) , Period martial arts ( The Banquet ) , and a good old thriller in World Without Thieves , amongst others in his filmography . I've yet to watch something that had disappointed , and his latest romantic drama If You Are The One starring long time collaborator Ge You and Shu Qi , proves to be yet another understated film that deserves a larger audience , if not for the limited number of screens ( two only ) in Singapore . Ge You plays Qin Fen , whom we are introduced as a one-time inventor of a product called the Conflict Resolution Tool , which got sold to a venture capitalist for millions . With his new found wealth , he decided to focus on settling down , and follows the recent trend of finding a suitable companion over the internet . Here's where the humour comes in , not in slapstick fashion , but through the earnest ways he presents himself with honesty , starting from his online profile which lists a number of his ordinary points quite upfront . Ge You is again at his element here , and he continues to surprise how he internalizes his roles , be it the grandeur of an emperor , or a straight-talking neighbour next door . Needless to say the best bits were in the first half , where like the 40 Year Old Virgin he goes on a schedule of blind dates after more blind dates , meeting countless of women with plenty of side agendas except settling down . His surprise comes in the form of Shu Qi's Xiaoxiao , because nobody would seriously expect a babe to hook up with someone through online means , given no lack of suitors already queuing up in the real world . I can trust a story written by Feng Xiaogang in that he crafts his characters with believability , and here he captures perfectly the essence of the dilemma of a middle aged man looking for a love partner . Knowing a below average joe would never be able to hold onto a relationship with a princess , given lack of funds , looks and power , Qin Fen passes up the chance quite honestly , but forms a firm friendship with Xiaoxiao . I guess Shu Qi's almost automatic first choice for a female lead role in a romantic film , having been seen very recently opposite Andy Lau in Look For A Star . While that role is a little more vivacious , her character here is a little more subdued , though no less glamorous as a stewardess with Hainan Air . Again she convinces with a credible performance of a woman who has this tremendous emotional baggage of being in love with a married man , who for obvious reasons cannot commit to her , nor wanting to let her go . She epitomizes Selfishness to the maximum , especially when deciding to trade and negotiate a relationship while knowingly still having a place in her heart for someone else , although credit given that she's upfront about it . What I particularly enjoyed about the film is its examination into seeking love through online means , where one has got to go through arduous ego-inflating profiles trying to seek out somebody for a blind date , which can turn out to be a tad disappointing when real life doesn't meet expectations set , no matter how small that is . The story excels , and is one of the key strengths of the film is in highlighting this disappointment . One can be magnanimous and make the best of the situation , or try to pull the plug as early as you can so as not to lead the other person on , or to waste everyone's time . It's all about having a little chance and taking risk at every possible opportunity presenting itself , and disappointments being just part and parcel of the process , especially when you have little brought to the table . Blessed with rich cinematography thanks to great locales in both China and in Hokkaido , Japan , look out too for plenty of cameos especially the blind dates that Qin Feng meets , the best ( to me ) was the short appearance of Vivian Hsu , who highlights once again some of the prejudices that any male would probably subscribe to as well . If there was a gripe , that will be the last scene which was quite unnecessary and too tacky , even though it was trying to make a not too subtle reference and statement to the real world financial crisis now , and the confidence to have in the Chinese financial system . I would only say to try not to miss this film despite the limited screens and timings , because this is certainly one movie that is worth its weight in gold . For those who cannot make it to the cinemas , the DVD is already out now , so you might just want to own it instead . Highly recommended , and goes into my shortlist of contenders for that end of year top movies list !
514990	317399	382932	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Ratatouille	The Pixar juggernaut continues ! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story , and through the years , Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers , with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them , not because it's cool to do things through the medium , but that it adds a certain powerful , believable dimension , with stories rooted to universal themes , yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told . The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far , but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille , a story about a rat , and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date . One of the rare successful rats in the animated genre is Mickey , but Remy here ( voiced by Patton Oswalt ) has more character , and with that photo realistic quality to him , will give Mickey a run for his money . It's a class act story about a rat who dreams of being somebody , of wanting to follow that dream in becoming a chef in Paris , and is undeterred by his size , and well , form , even though in any kitchen , the last thing you want is a rat in it . And to realize his dream , he forms a symbiotic friendship with bumbling Linguini ( Lou Romano ) , a garbage boy who just joined the restaurant which Remy's idol , the late renowned chef Gusteau ( Brad Garrett ) , founded . It's a story about the tussle between friendship and family , with the latter providing an added emphasis , and you'll happen to just about find a familiar chord to it . Remember the time when your folks frown upon the friends you keep , and how sometimes , through their good intentions , unwittingly stifle your hopes and desires ? Or how family becomes that obstructing stone on the pathway to success , or being taken for granted to provide for greedy , unabashed family and so-called friends ? Ratatouille explores these and more , though they're kept veiled and subtle for the narrative to move on , and never provided a dull moment for kids and adults alike . Pixar's animation continues to astound , and provide inspiration to the many 3D animators out there - they have always set new benchmarks for others to follow , and I think they're on top of their game with the excellent animated portrayal of Paris , the kitchen , and of course , the rats , with that touch of photo realistic quality to it all , which does wonders to the food presented . Amongst the food , I like the crusty breads best - you can almost feel the texture , and the rustling sound is just to die for . And the cheese , you can just feel it melt in your mouth . Mmm mmm ! The story's adversaries might be familiar - a mean boss Skinner ( Ian Holm ) and a mightier - than-though food critic Anton Ego ( Peter O'Toole ) , but it's the latter , despite his shorter screen time , that does its best to chill , and it was such an obvious jab with making him English . The comedy's here top notch , not necessarily relying solely on slapstick to bring on the laughs , but possessing many sly moments throughout as you root for little Remy and his escapades , less so for Linguini though , who comes off as that perfect loser in life . Ratatouille is a perfectly delicious offering worthy of that Pixar stamp , and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser . I'm not sure why the delay in getting it released here , and having to suffer watching poor quality animation along the way . But the wait is well worth it , and I bet everyone will be pleasantly surprised indeed , with all the ingredients coming together for that wonderful presentation , that tastes and looks ju st wonderful . Despite the overkill of trailers , pre-screening warnings to turn off your mobile phones , etc , continue to put your trust in that little rat Remy , and savour what Ratatouille has to offer . No regrets - highly recommended , and another contender for my top movie of the year listing . Ratatouille is preceded by the trailer for the next Pixar movie Wall-E , and a short Pixar featurette titled Lifted , about two aliens and one of their attempts in passing the Alien Abduction course . Stay throughout the animated end credits for a little coda at the end .
515036	317399	213985	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Parition	Purists who were up in arms about Chinese actresses playing Japanese characters like in Memoirs of the Geisha will probably flip again at the portrayals of Indians by non-Indian actors , and could cite again similar examples whether the country of origin lacked capable actors to pull the roles off ( Of course not , this is Bollywood we're talking about , certainly no lack of actors ) . But hey , this is a Canadian production , and those detractors were likely to have some axe to grind with Hollywood-ized versions of such movies , leaving this movie alone . Or maybe the subject matter explored here outweighed such negative , meaningless , counterproductive thoughts and arguments . Journeying back to the time of the British withdrawal from India , one of the policies introduced during the independence , is this little handiwork done by the British , which had the population at the time segregate themselves into Hindu India , and Muslim Pakistan . This led to migration of scores of people to either side of the partitioning , and with it came religious tensions , and mindless massacres from both sides . This movie through its narrative was no holds barred on this criticism , even though it too boiled down to misunderstandings and intolerance from both groups of people . Partition is a movie that I recommend , even though it's draped with heavy melodrama . Perhaps it's because it's a Romeo and Juliet type of story , with our protagonists not from feuding families , but from different religions . Gian Singh ( Jimi Mistry ) is an ex-soldier serving in the British army , and in his retirement from war , he returns to his village to seek a certain peace from within , after making a decision during the war which he has yet come to terms with . One day , he rescues Naseem Khan ( Kristin Kreuk ) from a massacre by the Sikhs on the Muslims who were en route to Pakistan , and shields her from his fellow men when they bayed for her blood . As you might have guessed , the two will fall in love amid the background of violence , and their love will transcend religion , culture , and intolerance . Or will it ? There are two acts in this movie , which I thought the second was somewhat hastened , given the idyllic pace which the first had dwelled in , sharing its rich cinematography by writer-director Vic Sarin . The story's development too moved into its fastest gear , especially in the finale which was what one would expect , and yes there were sniffles amongst the audience . What I thought was treaded quite superficially ( and I suppose it was perhaps on purpose ) was the dealing of religion , that it can be flipped flopped so easily . Perhaps herein laid a message that love will transcend that as well , given that after all , God is also about love ? Like how The Namesake made me sit up and take notice of Kal Penn , Partition had the same effect for Jimi Mistry . Best known for his comedic The Guru role in which he plays a " sexpert " , he's almost unrecognizable under that thick beard , and gave a very strong performance as a man haunted by his past , and finding a future with a loved one , willing to make extreme sacrifices for his family . Kristin Kreuk , in her second movie outing after her bimbotic role in Eurotrip , brings a more Smallville's Lana Lang-ish appeal to her character here , as she pines for the loves of her life , and lets those tears roll . No , she doesn't look a bit like your typical Pakistani girl , but yes , her beauty helps illuminate the screen . It's strange though to see her try her best to put on a believable accent , and mannerisms right down to head movements , but she looks good in those saris ! I was surprised to see Irfan Khan in a bit role here , having enjoyed his performance also in The Namesake , and Neve Campbell and John Light rounded up the supporting roles , with Neve's Margaret Stilwell a character whom I thought was a tragic one , no doubt if you interpreted as her still holding onto the candle for Gian , without him realizing , probably consciously aware that their status and skin colour are too different to have resulted in anything fruitful . With a one track beautiful theme song , lush sceneries , and wonderful performances , Partition is a surprise of the week , and over here , it's two screen release doesn't do it much justice . Should you want to watch a love story set against a historical background which still has repercussions until this very day , then make it a point not to miss this .
515406	317399	795421	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Mamma Mia !	I grew up to the songs of Swedish group ABBA ( yeah , I was born in the 70s , can ? ) , and yes I'm fan enough to have bought their definitive collection CD and DVD years ago to add to my library , and have it all in my iPod so that I can listen to the evergreens that never fail to put a smile on my face , although some songs actually have really heartbreaking moments in them if you listen carefully . Hollywood continues to plunder past musicals on stage and previously on screen , to come up with an updated version for celluloid , and it's actually no surprise that they roped in director Phyllida Lloyd , who directed the original Broadway play , to helm the cinematic version of Mamma Mia ! which in itself is quite genius to have been able to design a narrative around the songs already published by the pop band . And the result of course is nothing less than a crowd pleaser , especially for a fan like myself . I guess the trailers would already put in enough hints on what the storyline is about , that plays out like a Greek comedy with a bride to be Sophie ( Amanda Seyfried ) in wanting to know who her real father is , invited all the potentials from her mother Donna's ( Meryl Streep ) colorful free loving , hippie past , to attend her wedding with the ultimate aim of course to give her away during the ceremony . So the three of them - Bull Anderson ( Stellan Skarsgard ) , Sam Carmichael ( Pierce Brosnan ) and Harry Bright ( Colin Firth ) all turn up , leading to a comedy of errors , of reminiscence of a time gone by , of relationships turned sour , or what could have beens . Playing out over 24 hours at a Greek island where Donna runs a small crumbling hotel , you can tell that everyone of the star studded cast had a field day on set , especially when hamming up their respective characters - you can't get enough of Donna's posse in Rosie ( Julie Walters ) and Tanya ( Christine Baranski ) - and there are enough ABBA songs to go around either for individuals to showcase their singing prowess ( or lack thereof ! ) or to come together as an ensemble group to just let their hair down and have a lot of fun . Some would have deemed Meryl Streep not being able to deliver , but I thought she did well enough , and Amanda Seyfried at certain angles bore some uncanny resemblance to add some believability as her daughter . Pierce Brosnan on the other hand , you can tell was having a tough time trying to sound and sing convincingly . But that aside , I chuckled at plenty of moments when the hotel employees / Greek island inhabitants join in the chorus , and some infectious dance choreography when everyone chips in just makes this one heck of a pre-wedding celebrations . And if you need some reaffirmation of why you need to watch a musical in the cinemas , look no further than Mamma Mia ! . At first I frowned at the distributors for delaying its premiere here for so long , then now perhaps realized it was a shrewd move on their part ( as always ) , probably to help enhance the cinema going experience . Prints after late August come with lyrics at the bottom of the screen , so yep , we get the Sing Along Edition over here . And boy , the hall I was in - I think I was the only ( ahem inconsiderate ) one initially lending my vocals , whistling and humming to each song - by the time the last few songs came around , EVERYONE was singing along , kickstarted by the very moving song that happened to be my favourite of them all . So you know what to do , when you hit the cinemas for this . Lead and sing along , since the lyrics are there for all and sundry . And you'll get that fuzzy feeling when everyone else does the same thing . I heart Mamma Mia ! and you'll be hard pressed not to too !
514552	317399	468569	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Dark Knight	The Dark Knight is a brilliant film . Everything was done right , stemming from a totally rich and in depth story that never failed to deliver its punches where it mattered , and frankly speaking , caught me off guard a number of times with its superb sleight of hand technique . Every one of the A-list cast lived up to their potential , and evergreens from the previous movie like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine , have a lot more to do this time round . This is hands down THE movie of the year for me to date , and it'll really take a lot to knock it off its perch . I suggest you rush out of the door right now , get yourself tickets and watch it . I'm going to do so again . I believe in Christopher Nolan , and Bat-fans around the world would have followed suit too .
515070	317399	463903	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Be With Me	This is the third feature length film of internationally renowned local director Eric Khoo , and given the hype of this film's response in Cannes , I'm sure many in Singapore are eager to watch it , given that Eric Khoo's last movie , 12 Storeys , was a long 8 years ago . Meant To Be An old shopkeeper longs for his loved one to continue to be with him . He opens the movie by closing his shop , drawing us instead into his private life , where we see him alone , aloof , and in pain to see his loved one suffering in sickness . Try as he might , there is nothing he can or will do , or is it ? When you're with someone you love for so long , what does it mean to lose him or her ? Will you also lose the will to continue leading a meaningful life ? Or will it away in a mundane fashion ? Tying in with Theresa Chan's autobiographical tale , this segment is touted by most as the strongest and most touching . Finding Love A timid security guard Fatty Koh is a secret admirer of a high flying executive , and longs for her to be with him , somehow . An infatuation , a crush , how do you bring yourself to declare your feelings for someone , when you're shy , and knowingly aware of the huge social divide ? With a letter . Where you are given time and composure to write your thoughts down , hoping to bring the right message across , and harbouring the hopes of acceptance . We see Fatty fighting his inner shy demons as he carefully pens a letter of admiration for his dream lover . Fate seems to be against him , as he cannot seem to concentrate with the ruckus from the neighbours , and from his own family where he's looked down upon . At times it's like a look back into the life and times of the timid fat lady in 12 Storeys , who incidentally , appears ( as a different cameo character of course ) in this segment briefly . He steals glances at his love when at work , and hangs around the perimeter of her home after work , worshipping her from afar . He's like a gentle giant , never meaning any harm , but probably coming across as a desperate stalker . Love conquers all some say , but will it ? So In Love Ezann Lee plays Jackie ( note the androgynous name ) , a lesbian who longs for her new lover , Sam ( played by Samantha Tan , note the androgynous name too ) , to be with her . Most teenage / young adults in the audience will definitely be pretty familiar with this stage of puppy and experimental young love , which was given a modern retelling showcasing relationships in the era of pervasive computing devices - Internet Messaging and Short Message Service . And of course having two pretty young leads in non-conventional roles do help too , They first meet online , and we follow their new shared lives as they finally meet in person , doing things couples do like watching movies , go clubbing , hanging out , shopping , the works . Everything seems lovey-dovey , happy-go-lucky , doesn't it ? However , the motive of Sam getting involved with Jackie is examined , and the universal theme of unrequited love comes to the forefront . What happens when a lover is suddenly spurned by the other , when all along you thought that everything was going wonderfully well , and you see a future with the other half ? You'll be terribly hurt , but what will you do , especially when lied to ? Was everything just one big illusion ? For folks with weak hearts , being lied to is like having a tonne of bricks collapsing onto you . Like a cautionary tale of being responsible with feelings and not toying with those of another , it is a reminder that as fast as these perceived love begin , it is never as easy to erase it from one's life like deleting an incoming SMS message . The narrative introduces us to the various characters from the 3 segments , intertwining their lives with one another in brief moments . The style used in the movie is different , where we begin with the introductions of the segments until forlorn conflicts in each sets in , hanging us in the balance where we ponder and reflect the futility of each character's actions thus far . Until we're introduced , in more detail , to Theresa Chan's inspiration life . One of difficulties and immense challenges , but one who exudes courage to face up and tackle life by the bull's horns . Losing both sight and hearing , Theresa is a double handicap . To many , we take our senses from granted , until we lament the loss of one . But what about two , without warning ? Will we be able to find the same courage within us to smile and carry on living ? Theresa's life story is told , not by narration , but by subtitling . We read in silence her struggles and life filled with chance encounters which made her stronger . As mentioned , her life story is read by the old shopkeeper , integrating her tale into Meant To Be , taking center stage in the middle of the film , and leading all the segments of the movie into its closure . This is mainly a silent film , not that it doesn't have any dialogue , but rather the characters have more silent time than speaking lines . Kudos to the cast for having to really express their thoughts through body language and facial expressions - this film really does plenty of close ups . I highly recommend this brilliant yet unconventional film . It has something for everyone , be it touching on your personal experiences in love and life , or simply reminding you of the good things you have in life , or inspiring you to do a lot more . Life's full of ups and downs , but it is the perspective in which you view it from , which matters . The choice is yours .
515366	317399	452631	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Home Song Stories	The Home Song Stories made its debut at the Berlin Film Festival earlier this year , and I've waited a long time for it to come to our shores . A joint Singapore-Australian production , it's an autobiographical story of writer-director Tony Ayres ' childhood , of what he remembers about his mother , a songstress who uprooted her children and migrated from Hong Kong to Australia , and their struggles to etch a living surviving in a strange land . When watching the film , I can't help but to remember Alfonso Cuaron's Great Expectations , where Ethan Hawke's Finn narrated a line early in the movie , stating quite clearly he's not going to tell the story the way it happened , but rather he's telling it the way he remembered it . And this rings very true in Ayres ' Home Song Stories . Stories from within are always heartfelt and sincere , and that's what this movie brings across - the feeling that it's from deep down , and that of honesty . Like how the movie started with the Chinese oldie " Bu Liao Qing " , mirroring the style the story was told and the narrative being measured , powerful , and very meaningful . What made it work was the excellent acting all round . Of late I've enjoyed Joan Chen's movies these days , compared to her earlier works ( like Judge Dredd or On Deadly Ground ) . Aging like fine wine , her maturity brings about certain gravitas and also likability as she takes on more adult roles , and it's no doubt my favourites were her motherly roles in Saving Grace , Jasmine Women , and now , Home Song Stories . Here , she plays Rose , one who lives on the fast lane in Hong Kong , with some untold secrets from the past . In order to give her two children the best life she could , she milks her looks for what it's worth because of her lack of ability and skill , and for some reason , succumbs to her weakness for men quite easily , falling fast and falling hard , flitting from man to man , being unlucky in love , and providing some headache and embarrassment for her children , who do not know what to make out of the " Uncles " that come through the door . And Qi Yuwu , no doubt bolstered by his cinematic appearance in 881 , gets a meatier role with dialogue . He stars as Joe the illegal immigrant , the young man whom Rose falls for , and becomes surrogate father to her children , and yet , having this threatening air that he has some ulterior motives set on Rose's daughter May ( Irene Chan ) . You might think he's a cad , what with his 70s look and that glint in the eye , but overall , he's someone whom you'll compare with Bill ( Steven Vidler ) , the Australian sailor whom Rose comes to Australia for . Putting both Bill and Joe side by side and the choice is obvious for Rose , but alas , the ditzy indecisiveness of womanhood causes great despair amongst her loved ones . More so for her son Tom , played by Joel Lok . The narrative stems from his point of view , and Lok is the absolute winner here , in fleshing out Tom , the kid who lives in his fantasies , a form of escapism to a very confused childhood . You might think that he's able to take the blows in his stride , but I guess everyone , including a kid , has his own patience . You feel his pain , his confusion , his tears as he struggles to understand his mother's actions . He loves her , yet hates her , and Lok displays a masterful performance here that you might think he's a veteran . This kid's charming , pure and simple . There are many plus points in this movie which makes it exquisite , and the wonderful songs used accentuates the era of that time perfectly . What made it work too was that the characters aren't forced to speak only one language , highlighting their multi-lingual nature quite naturally as they converse in Cantonese , Mandarin and English , which makes it seem more realistic rather than staged . It showcases growing pains really well , of relationships amongst siblings and with a single parent , and what I thought was one of the most powerful run up to an unforgettable scene , was a reminder that when dealing with people , to always be mindful of the hateful words we use . They might be said in the fit of a moment , but they always hurt bad , because everyone has feelings . Like the Chinese saying goes , once it's uttered , it's extremely difficult to retract , and the consequence of it could be damaging or devastating . At its core , The Home Song Stories evokes painful memories , but also brings about the notion of forgiveness , remembering and honouring those memories . A mother's love knows no bounds , even if she behaves in a manner you cannot quite grasp at the moment . Stay tuned when the end credits roll , as you get to see a little more of Ayres ' life and times , and of course , his real mother , put together in a photo montage . This is one movie which you definitely must watch this week . Highly recommended !
514461	317399	999922	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Ultraman Mebius & Ultraman Brothers	I grew up watching Ultraman on television , so much so that back then I can sing the theme song , in Japanese ( of course not knowing exactly what it meant ) ! With so many variations on the Ultra heroes , it's actually quite easy for a kid to follow , with each episode having a different ugly monster wreck havoc on Earth ( ok , make that Japan ) , and each time Ultra - whoever will transform himself , do battle through his kung-fu moves , until that red light on his chest blinks as an indication to stop monkeying around , and then he finishes the monster with his signature moves . Ah , nostalgia ! But what I did like about Ultraman , was indeed the intricate modelling done on the landscapes of Japan , and how they get so painfully destroyed by the monster imitating Gojira , or when our hero is on the receiving end of a smackdown to the ground . And the special effects , though so dated today , were really captivating to a kid those days . I have many fond memories of my collection of Ultraman figurines , which somehow mysteriously disappeared after cousins came visiting one afternoon many years back . Over the years , especially after television stopped airing updated episodes , Ultraman faded , but always had a special place inside my heart . There were the new versions of late , what with Ultraman Tiga , Dyna and what have yous . I found their design to be un-Ultraman like , especially with their shades of blue . Watching some episodes didn't trigger my interest , so I did not pick up from where I left off . However , in celebration of 40 years since the creation of the very first Ultraman , a new movie ( only released in disc format here ) was spotted on the shelves , that of a certain Ultraman Mebius . While I thought his colour scheme was right , and the new kid on the block very nicely designed and pleasing to the eye , what caught my interest was the words " Ultraman Brothers " , and in the same cover , you see the heroes of old , including Ultraman , Ultraman Jack , Ultraseven , and Ultraman Ace , together with Ultraman Taro and Ultraman Zoffy . Wow ! But the barebones DVD coupled with its unattractive price put me off for a bit , until I saw a preview of it being shown on the television of an electronics shop . And I was sold ! I bought the DVD , and rarely do I pop it into the player immediately ( I still have stacks of DVDs unwatched ) , but I did for this one . And I loved it tremendously , nevermind the kiddish plot and central theme of " the power of confidence can give you courage " kinda fortune cookie sayings . For the uninitiated ( as if I was an expert ) , Yi Lai is in the GUYS formation , one of those world wide policemen with snazzy equipment and vehicles to combat monsters that invade earth , but almost without a doubt never using such firepower given the presence of Ultraman . Yi Lai is Ultraman Mebius , and when called upon , he has this transformation device attached to his wrist to being him up to size . Mebius is quite athletic , and has a range of powers which this movie will introduce you to , coupled with a streak of green in his level of experience . After all , Mebius had selected to come to earth because he wanted to find out whatever happened to his brothers Ultraman , Jack , Ace and Seven . The quartet had been living a life of seclusion of sorts in their human form , sacrificing their ability to transform in order to imprison a vicious monster . And you know what the best part is ? The filmmakers got the ORIGINAL human actors to portray their aged counterparts , and fused some montage shots from their resp ective series of yesteryears ! You just cannot get any more cooler or more authentic than that ! Pure nostalgia flowing I tell you ! And this lends some weight when the quartet had to counsel Yi Lai and dispense some tips and tricks to our new rookie protector of earth - we've been there , and done that ! Not to spoil the story ( which isn't much anyway ) , the action sequences are to die for . Fans will recognize our respective heroes ' signature killer moves , and after 40 years , CGI has crept into the movie in the depiction of our heroes ' battles against the monsters , but that is not to say it's forgetting its man-in-a-rubber-suit heritage . You get the best of both worlds combined , with close-ups and more physical stunts done by stuntmen , and the more fantastical , in flight action rendered through computer graphics . It's pure eye-candy , and one which you're definite to watch on repeat ! This is a recommended must watch for all Ultraman fans out there , and I'm already eyeing the original series boxset which is currently still priced beyond my reach . Tears will flow when I watch those episodes I tell you ! And Mebius does seem interesting enough for me to want to follow his exploits . So if anyone out there wanna get my a gift for whatever occasion , you probably know what to get me now , don't you ? : P
515226	317399	819794	10.0	A Nutshell Review : My Mother is a Belly Dancer	My Mother is a Belly Dancer is the last in the series of the FOCUS : First Cuts project , and to my surprise , it's my favourite of the lot , beating Crazy Stone , one of my movies of the year 2006 ! It's no secret that I dig dance movies , but this one is not the usual flick filled with teen angst and such . It has a lot more gravitas to it , and contains characters that you actually care for , with universal themes which makes it easier to reach out to audiences . Belly dancing is getting popular amongst the dance crowd in Singapore . It's sensual , with those shoulder shimmies and belly twists , and contains moves that will probably give those abs a fabulous workout . It's a traditional dance , and no doubt with its sensuousness , it takes a little getting used to , especially for local Asian women who are generally shy to expose that midriff and shake that booty . ( Clarification : I think younger women have no qualms , but the movie's focus is on the " auntie crowd " ) Set in a residential estate , the film looks into the lives of 4 women , and how dance , in particular the belly dance , helped to develop them into stronger women , from the traditional demure roles into independent womanhood . We actually look at mums of different ages and backgrounds , such as a housewife who gains no respect from her husband nor her kid son , a single , young mother , a fruit seller whose husband she suspects is having an affair , and finally , a rubbish collector whose facing problems with feeding her large family of kids given her husband's inability to hold down a well paying job . Before you scream in disgust that this is typical women-power stuff , I'd like to assure that it actually has a lot of heart , and that's what made this movie so enjoyable . It's about finding strength and the acceptance of reality . It's about assertion and moving on . Each woman face their own unique problems in their lives , and by coming together in the dance class , they form a strong bond with one another , especially when the dance class itself face discrimination from the more traditional , uptight older womenfolk who view it as immoral and slutty . Their problems and challenges in their personal lives run viz-a-viz the issues of keeping their class alive , and by saving their class and keeping their spirits alive , they too subconsciously experience a change in their character . The lead actresses , though not frequently seen in movies these days , all put up commendable performances , even though some of their characters start off in a one - dimensional manner . They added believability with their earnest portrayals of women facing problems , and who turn out for the better when they discover new strength during their dance sessions , and through the forging of new bonds . Andy Lau returns to lend some star power in the movie , as with most of the other FOCUS : First Cuts project films . Here , he cameos as the owner of a middle eastern bar , where women congregate and share their love for belly dancing . So just what exactly is happiness ? That's what the movie seeks to explore , and presents at the same time , the common viewpoints of family live as seen through different eyes , in different forms , under different circumstances .
515566	317399	796366	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Star Trek	My adventures with the original William Shatner-led Enterprise crew had been confined to the cinematic movies of Star Trek , plus sporadic episodes from the original television series . I grew up more with Patrick Stewart's Captain Jean-Luc Picard commanding the Next Generation on board the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D in exploring strange new worlds and civilizations , as well as every movie made following that crew . It's quite unfortunate that Nemesis didn't fare too well at the box office , and hence it took this long ( some 7 years ! ) before another Star Trek movie got made . In between we had other spin off series like Deep Space Nine , Voyager , and Enterprise , all which somehow didn't appeal to me , and their ability to cross over to the cinematic screen was , I guess , questionable . Then the question of how and where does one even begin in making another mass appeal movie , which by now has a whole wealth of content , and canonical ones at that . Imagine an established franchise with fans worldwide , some practically religious followers , and convince them that what you're making , and a reboot at that ( horrors ! ) would be the right way forward ? But I got to take my hands off to J . J . Abrams , and especially to the scribes of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for really having the balls , and the smarts , to do what they did . It's a reboot all right , but a really clever way to jump-start a legacy without making a mockery of its rich history , providing an acceptable ( though not never seen before ) method relying on stuff that science fiction is made up of . Of course I won't tell you what it is , you'll have to find out yourself , suffice to say that it made everything fall in place , with the involvement of Leonard Nimoy , and the background of the Romulan villain played to stereotypical perfection by Eric Bana . At its core , with this reboot , it allowed for the film to establish the paralleled and troubled background of the ship's Captain and First Officer , James Tiberius Kirk ( Chris Pine ) and Vulcan Mr . Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) , and with all solid partnerships and friendships , they too don't begin seeing eye to eye . It's a little bit curious though that this version of Star Trek has forgone its television roots for the cinematic debut first , and even though both Pine and Quinto came from TV , I don't expect to see this particular film spin off a television franchise of its own ( though I'm secretly hoping so ! ) . If anything , there should be an ongoing series ( if box office receipts permit ) for the cinema instead of the gogglebox . It takes a while to showcase these individual characters at the top of the Enterprise command , before we get to see the rest of the familiar crew , now replaced with fresh faces , like John Cho as Sulu , Karl Urban as Dr . Leonard " Bones " McCoy , Anton Yelchin as Mr Chekov , Zoe Saldana as Uhura , and Simon Pegg as Scotty , whom fans will have to wait until the mid way point to see his very limited , though memorable appearance on the deck of the ship . Since it's an " origin " film of sorts , we get more acquainted to Spock , who now demonstrates more emotions rather than cold logic from the Nimoy era , and Kirk still rolling with the punches as the action-hero man , still defiant and often unorthodox in his approach to the mission at hand . Fans itching to see what James T . Kirk is famous for , you'll finally get to see that in his Starfleet Academy days here . The pacing of the film was as energetic as that of its younger cast , and what is a 126 minute movie did feel as if it's under 90 minutes , where it begins with a bang from the get go , and never decelerates from its warp speed . Abrams kept the pace very fluid , balancing emotional scenes with the more action-packed ones , though I feel there would be some passing pre - mature judgement that Star Trek is never about the action . That's true here as well ( except probably when you're faced with Kirk hanging on a ledge of some sorts no less than 3 times ) , in case you're wondering about the trailer's bells and whistles . The sound design was excellent as well , as you really get to experience that silence of space each time the vast void comes to fill up the entire screen . Non-fans might find some reason to scoff at Star Trek being a bit stiff , but this version makes it all sexy again . There's a wonderful story that doesn't pander to the audience nor disrespect its rich history , perfectly fused moments of humour , adequate action , and that core story of how the Enterprise crew got together for its maiden mission , and primed for more when the end credits roll . And it's just nostalgic to see the good ' ol USS Enterprise NCC-1701 given a facelift by Industrial Light and Magic , and taking flight again ! Definitely highly recommended , for fans who will be smiling from ear to ear when spotting little gizmos and easter eggs from knowledge of hindsight , and non-fans alike , who would likely be converted and inspired to go dig through the video archives for the original missions .
514810	317399	291350	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Millennium Actress ( DVD )	Having watched Satoshi Kon's Paprika and Tokyo Godfathers , it's a no brainer that I would jump at the chance to watch Millennium Actress . And I wasn't disappointed , though if I would rate this movie amongst the others I've seen , then my preference will be in reverse chronological order , not that Millennium Actress is no good , but you do see the scaling of new heights in the newer works . I'm quite amazed at how a single theme ( at least to me ) managed to weave itself into a compelling story , and one which paid homage to the history of Japan , and to Japanese films . The actress in the title refers to Chiyoko Fujiwara ( voiced by three different actresses - Miyoko Shoji , Mami Koyama and Fumiko Orikasa ) , and chronicles the story of her career . As such , we get to see her in various characters and costumes , in different genres set in different eras , like the Samurai films , science fiction , romance dramas , and even monster movies . Now a senior citizen who has since retired from the limelight , she's being tracked down for an interview by Genya Tachibana ( Shozo Izuka ) and his cameraman Ida Kyoji ( Masaya Onosaka ) , as she's the icon for a movie studio which is being torn down . But there's more to Genya's intentions of just speaking to her , and that secret in which he has will form the basic crux of the story . To some , it might be groundhog day narrative style as events get repeated , although in different reel eras . It's about chasing after a loved one , one who has disappeared , and about your relentless pursuit , never to give up for that glimmer of hope , for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . In many aspects , there's a lot of reel life imitating real , and the presentation style is definitely a notch in the direction of class , having interpolate Genya and Ida into the memories of Chiyoko as they learn first hand the events that she encounters , and relive those memories in the form of the movies she had starred in . In this manner of skillfully manipulating images and colour , the movie becomes layered in multiple fashion , and is quite innovative , rather than telling the story in a flat out chronological style . The story nevertheless remains immensely touching , and bittersweet as well , particularly when a key secret is revealed , and you find yourself having to hold back that tear from coming out of your eye , especially when you have experienced a similar , relentless chase for something that you do not know what the outcome is . As always , the movie is richly animated with deep background details that you do not keep your eyes off the screen , and definitely deserves multiple re-watchings . Definitely highly recommended .
515034	317399	413300	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Spider-Man 3	Spider-Man 3 ushers in this year's many sequels in what would be a crowded blockbuster summer , but the question on everyone's lips is , with so many villains he's up against , will our friendly neighborhood arachnid prevail the movie sequel curse - that with many villains and being the third superhero movie in the franchise , it will most certainly be a dud and a victim of its own success ? Sam Raimi will have none of that , and found a special x-factor from within his own Spidey movie franchise to ensure sustainability . And it worked great . Superior sequels are a tough act to follow , and only a handful managed to survive the fatigue . It's not about putting in better effects , or introducing new and more powerful villains , but rather about the characters whom we have followed through from the previous movies . Here , we continue our journey with Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) , Mary Jane Watson ( Kirsten Dunst ) and Harry Osborn ( James Franco ) , their love hate relationship with one another , and the will they or won't they situations . Having the creative team return ( sans Danny Elfman for the score ) and the principal cast intact ensured no continuity issues , which have casted a shadow on and doomed many other superhero productions like DC's Superman-Chris Reeves franchise , or the Batman one started by Tim Burton . Instead of relying on fluffy showmanship on the latest progression of how Spidey swings through Manhattan , and the temptation to shift all its grandeur action pieces to top gear , Spider-Man 3 actually had its characters spend much of their time out of costumes . Which is great , except for those impatient to get things going . It allowed for plenty of space for character development , a continuation of the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane , which on the previous movie's final scene , seemed to have an ominous feeling hung overhead . And yes , things are not going well for our couple . One's a public figure behind a mask , getting plenty of adulation from the common man on the street , while the other , still a struggling artiste in a cold unforgiving city . For Peter Parker , he's thrilled to have people celebrate his prowess , and allowed for success to get to his nerdy head . A nerd getting all the attention , certainly puts him a bit out of whack . He hardly listens , and the keyword here is listen ( take note , important to sustain relationship lesson abound ) , to his partner , and becomes emotionally unavailable , especially when she most needs him . And with miscommunication or the lack thereof , jealousy comes in the form of hot blonde bombshell Gwen Stacy ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) , with whom Peter violates a special bond between him and Mary Jane at the heat of the moment ( ok , all those who think it's being petty , might want to rethink that again ) . As a reminder , this is not the comic's Spider-Man . If it is , then Peter won't have organic web-shooters . So don't go all rile about Gwen's introduction at this stage of the franchise . It's her on screen , so celebrate that instead . Although she's a bit role , I thought Bryce Dallas Howard allowed fan boys to salivate at the prospect of having Gwen Stacy feature heavily in possible future movies . If Kirsten Dunst wish to bury her Mary Jane Watson aside , the franchise can definitely move on with Bryce stepping in with her Gwen , even though this time the comic time line will totally go out of sync . But to be fair to Dunst , her Mary Jane almost always have nothing much to do when Spidey's in costume , unless she decides to challenge for scream queen honors . It's again the same old damsel in distress the character finds herself in for a fair bit , and there's certainly a number of times where you can be held hostage , before some smart alec will deduce the reason why .
515259	317399	407887	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Departed	The big question on the minds of those who have seen the original Hong Kong movie is whether this Hollywood remake is worth watching . I'd say hell yeah , down to your last dollar , weekend price or otherwise . Infernal Affairs ( 2002 ) earned its place in recent Asian movie history for reenergizing the cop thriller genre . Directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak , the movie had a one of a kind storyline about mole vs mole in the underworld and the police , and starred heavyweights Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai in the lead roles , with support by recognized character actors Anthony Wong , and Eric Tsang , with the appeal of Gen-X / Y actors in Edison Chen and Shawn Yue . After opening to rave reviews and becoming a trilogy , the rumour mill was out and about with Hollywood wanting to do a remake , starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise , whom to my personal speculation , would have just been as riveting with either actors taking on either role . It's a kind of Face / Off situation where the distinction between good-bad guys gets blurred . Essentially , with any spectacular , gripping story , you can have it done and made countless of times , and each version should all come out great given that the source - the story - is the same . However , it is always easy to screw up and not meet expectations , and herein likes the innate pressure that the cast and crew must have felt , taking on something that works , and making it their own . In Martin Scorsese's The Departed , the director teams up once again with Leonardo DiCaprio , after two consecutive collaborations in Gangs of New York and The Aviator . Here , DiCaprio takes on Tony Leung's role as the police mole in the underworld , headed by Frank Costello ( Jack Nicholson ) . As Billy Costigan , the biggest challenge is always to be on the positive side of an unsteady gangland boss , and maintaining some form of sanity while dealing with an identity crisis . Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan , in a role modelled after Andy Lau's , as the gang member inside the police force , feeding information to Costello . He finds himself living the good life . and contemplates the risk in having throw it all away should he get caught . And the cat and mouse game begins as both moles try to outwit , outplay and outlast each other , knowing that any revelation of their true identities will be totally disastrous , each trying to flush the other guy out . The acting's all round superb from both leads , with a stellar ensemble featuring recognizable faces in Mark Wahlberg , Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin . It's a welcome return for Nicholson back in the bad guy role after his recent attempts at comedies . I thought each instance where Wahlberg came on is a hoot , as his character , Dignam , comes with a dirty mouth which shoots off the cuff . In fact , Anthony Wong's character had to be split into two , shared between Sheen and Wahlberg ( which I think is a nod to Wong's ability , given two persons required to fill his shoes ) . Newcomer Vera Farmiga took on Kelly Chen's role as the psychiatrist and Sammi Cheng's role combined into one , doing away with probably an additional unnecessary character which the original featured . There are other minor changes along the way ( no remake can be an exact copy of another ) , but none too drastic , keeping intact the integrity of the premise , key scenes , and plot elements and devices . Clocking in at almost two and a half hours , an hour longer than the original , you will not feel its length , even as the movie took its time to establish the story and its characters . The dialogue is a major draw with some memorable lines , and if you've watched the original , your mind is constantly racing to draw parallels , but in most times , you'll find it equally engaging and as exciting , as if you're coming across the story for the very first time . Of course the pivotal ending , which was marred with the original having two of them to pander to being politically correct , is one such scene which actually helps to build anticipation as to how Scorsese would have to conclude . It's that sense of familiarity , yet a sense of something new . With some scenes being extended in duration , it helped build a certain depth for the characters as well , which does wonders for the movie . But what I felt lacked in this remake , was that personal link between the two moles , of a " what-if " scenario between the two before they faced off each other . Here , they are adversaries all the way , but the original provided a sort of hint , that if these two were on the same side of the law , they could have been the best of friends . Also , in the first mole versus mole match up , while in an attempt to be different from the original , it unfortunately lacked the intensity that Infernal Affairs had , but just for this particular scene . If you're wondering if The Departed is as good as Infernal Affairs , I'd say it is a worthy remake , except for that cheesy last shot before the end credits rolled . Some folks are already screaming Oscars . But remember , Asian Cinema produced this gem first ! P . S even though rated M18 locally , there were noticeable cuts in the movie , especially in dialogues .
