515186	317399	290212	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Full Frontal	2 words : It SUCKS ! OK , so sue me , perhaps i don't know how to appreciate this film , so if you do , write a comment will ya ? This movie starts off as a movie within a movie , called Rendezvous . For the next hour , you're left wondering what the heck is this movie all about . Simple . Basically just telling you stories behind those characters leading up to their attending a director's ( Gus , played by Duchonvy , less than 10 mins screen time mind you ) birthday party . Characters include a black actor ( Blair Underwood ) , a white actress ( Julia Roberts ) , a HR vice president of some company , her sister who's going to meet some guy whom she knew from IRC , that guy from the IRC who didn't really tell her frankly who he was ( some art director rather than a painter ) , a stage actor , and many others you probably won't give a hoot about . However , the only saving grace was David Fincher and Brad Pitt playing themselves . Watch out for Fincher's spoof of his own directing style ( the endless reshoots of even simple scenes involving only 1 spoken line ) . Although the movie is draggy , stay on during the end credits where you get to see some contrived behind the scenes shots , as well as a Brad Pitt " Easter Egg " scene right at the end . That is if you still have the patience to torture yourself through it all . A lot of people in my screening left halfway through the show , and those who forced themselves to sit through the ending because they paid $8 . 50 darted out of the theatre once the credits start rolling . Don't watch , unless you really think you can pretend to understand the show .
515477	317399	278674	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Return to Pontianak	Asian horror movies have always been popular here , and even local film The Maid by Kelvin Tong managed to strike gold at the box office , here and overseas as well , going against the grain of thought that local movies do not make money . However , in the recent surge of local movie making , there was another Singapore horror movie made , Return to Pontianak , which seemed to hold some promise with its reimagining / retelling of the legendary Malay female spirit . There were signs that it was bad - a friend's warning , and the turnout for the screening was a paltry 10-15 persons , but I just had to watch it for myself . The verdict ? This made in 2001 movie reeks , and reminds you of failed attempts by filmmakers around the world in taking something quite established , and then giving their own creative spin on it . While some might work , most of them will go the way of the Hollywood Godzilla . If this Pontianak were to go head long with the original Pontianak in a one on one , director Djinn's version will be made to wash the original's flowing white garbs . While the originals made in the 50s and 60s ( I watched Sumpah Pontianak starring Maria Menado ) were cheesy and lacking in grand special effects , they had a lot of heart . This one absolutely doesn't . Made after the highly successful Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) , this is one movie which should be seen , as a lesson learnt in how NOT to make a horror film . It's strange that much of it emulated Blair Witch , with its forest setting , characters roaming around getting routinely lost , and its highly puke inducing jerky camera motions . While Blair Witch had a reason for it , Return to Pontianak's boils down to budget . Neither has it any scary moments or atmosphere , aside from some mumbo-jumbo recitings and the awful soundtrack which is a horror in itself . While characters in most horror movies are throwaways , and only in established classics that you have a tinge of development , the characters developed for Return to Pontianak are those that happen to be of the irritating kind . They don't look good ( Hollywood compensates for the lack of story with awesome eye candy ) , and neither do they spout interesting lines . Dialogue is awful and contrived , and the bad sound design makes things worse . Caricatures abound , you have a group of five , led by the protagonist called Charity ( Hiep Thi Le ) ( the last time I heard this name was in Hong Kong's StormRiders ) , who developed a sudden urge to seek out her biological parents in the jungles of Pontianak ( hence the title , other than the reference to the " hantu " ) . Joining her are a fugly man-girl called Uzi ( Eleanor Lee ) , whose mouth is automatically set to spout vulgarities like a sub-machine gun , an ignorant slacker ang mo Luke ( Steve Banks ) , the boring techno-geek Raymond ( Victor Khong ) , and a pretty useless and incompetent local guide called Eye ( Fadali ) . For the first hour , nothing much happens , and you have to endure bad bitching , bad acting , bad acting , bad sound , bad cinematography . That is until a mysterious couples appear , and the clich√©s associated with horror movie making come out in some force , although bad makeup , and more bad acting continue to plague the movie . Thankfully , the sound design improved in the last 30 minutes , but that's because most of the time the movie is silent , save for the rustling sounds of a tropical rainforest . And what of Pontianak herself ? Well , she comes out in the day . Which is preposterous . And she's totally lacking in prowess that made her infamous . Worse yet , this Pontianak is totally devoid of motivations and origins , and doesn't differentiate herself with any other ordinary ghost and goblin out there . For anyone not versed in the Pontianak lore , you might wonder what's the big deal . All in all , an extremely poor retelling . But if there is any consolation , it's that perhaps the filmmakers learnt from this bad episode , and given Djinn's Perth ( 2005 ) , you can see a fairly large jump in terms of storytelling craft . A better budget probably helped , and maybe the realization that something more rooted to earth is the better path for him ? Retitled Voodoo Nightmare for the overseas market , this movie has not much voodoo magic , but plenty of nightmares . Nightmares of a movie gone totally wrong .
515066	317399	896815	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Missing	I hate to make such a statement , but until I see something better from him , I think Tsui Hark has lost his Midas Touch . He had given us wonderful movies , some of which are my personal favourites like the Once Upon A TIme in China series starring Jet Li , and the Blade , but in his attempt to register a more prolific comeback after his less than stellar stab at Hollywood , his recent filmography had blown hot and cold , with more misses save for his collaboration in Triangle . Missing unfortunately falls into the Stinker category . No doubt there's a ton of potential as to how the story could develop , given the teases in the trailer , but what was delivered happened to be a convoluted plot which made very little sense and became extremely indecisive , like an octopus putting its tentacles into every conceivable nook and cranny genre ranging from supernatural romance to psychological thriller , that if it had stuck to one primary idea , it might have been fairly enjoyable . Unfortunately , it seemed like Hark wanted to ape after the contemporary Asian horror masters in the Pang Brothers from technique in storytelling , right down to casting one of their regular lead actress Angelica Lee as the role of Dr Gao Jin , a psychologist who hits it off with underwater photographer Dave Chen ( Guo Xiao Dong ) , the brother of her patient Xiao Kai ( Isabella Leong ) . A whirlwind romance ensues and in Dave's bid to propose to his beau underwater near the ruins off Japan's Yonaguni Island ( which you don't get to see at all ) , tragedy strikes , but we don't get to see what actually happened , providing the avenue for mysterious flashbacks and investigations into what was . But there's when most of the 2 hour runtime seem to find itself stuck in , coming up with so many subplots they get dumped unceremoniously when they no longer fit the whim of the moment . You get some outright statements on ecology and the saving of our oceans , then you get some spooky scenes with mysterious figures and spirits trying to garner some cheap scares . Granted these are the moments which were suspense filled and the audience let on to expect further exploration at a later time , only to be disappointed by its lack of focus no thanks to wanting to experiment with some fiery special effects . Just when you think you got the hang of things , Missing throws you totally off tangent with yet another major revelation almost two-thirds of the way , in what I would deem as a cheap cop-out , where further explanation would spoil it for you . Suffice to say that if you like the Pang Brothers ' Diary , then you might buy into Missing . Otherwise , you'll begin to roll your eyes and clock watch , as the story begins to suffer from its now unbelievable and much scattered design , and relied too much on coincidence to move everything forward toward a finale that just seem to not know when to end . And that was its ultimate flaw . It had plenty of moments when to pull the plug to mitigate the suffering of an audience , but no , it dragged on , and on , with each moment building on the ridiculousness of the previous minutes . In all honesty , I understood Tsui Hark's intentions in attempting to bring out a more emotional film about love and lost , especially toward the end when it realized it had burnt the bridges to salvage something horrific . In its lazy presentation in not knowing what to edit and leave out of the story , Missing felt just like one of the props in the movie , a headless body without any clear direction where to go towards . I thought it had hit the nail on the head during one of the many endings , but realized this last ditch attempt was wasted when it still refused to roll the end credits . And no matter how much pedigree Angelica Lee has brought from her reigning Scream - Queen experience , somehow it was just that which turns out to be the albatross around her neck , as she offers nothing new from her range of expressions in movies like The Eye , and Re-cycle , other than look visibly aged . Isabella Leong doesn't fare any better too with her character as she turns vampish in her role when she returns to the incident site to seek out her brother , and Tony Leung Kar Fai and Chang Chen had only supporting roles to bookend the movie . The latter's role was surprisingly the better one as a soft-spoken man with a penchant for predicting the supernatural , but alas is one character that is forgotten soon enough . Final verdict ? Watch Missing at your own peril . It does boast some very few moments of genuine horror , and nicely done special effects , before surrendering everything to slip - shoddy storytelling . The more subplots it dwelled upon , the more loopholes managed to creep into it , making the title a premonition of what the movie is actually all about - missing everything needed to make this a decent movie .
514896	317399	104455	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Painted Skin ( DVD )	Painted Skin is the last movie that King Hu made , and while he revisits Pu Songling's material from Liao Zai , which he last did for his masterpiece A Touch of Zen , this movie however seemed a little strange and terribly dated , with uninspiring plots and despite the power cast , the characters all came off to be going through the motions , and not injecting any life at all . I am not sure why or how this project came about , but there were a number of missteps along the way . For example , prior to this 1993 release , Joey Wong had already been type-casted for her many roles as the ethereal ghostly enchantress with her roles in the Chinese Ghost Story franchise by Tsui Hark , up to a point I remember that audiences were sick of her portrayal , and cemented her reputation as a one-act actress . Here , she gets cast again as a spirit of sorts who cannot go to Heaven or Hell , and is practically stuck in limbo . Her You Feng meets with yet another scholar type character ( do I hear the yawns and groans already ) Wang Hsi Tzu , played by Adam Cheng , but instead of the usual dashing swordsman type figure that Cheng is famous for , he takes a turn and portrays a character who's main objective is to find a woman who can bear him an heir , because his wife is found barren . Now how this develops is almost comedic - right from the start after Hsi Tzu's initial encounter with a playful priest , he bumps into You Feng , gets horny , brings her home and wants to hump her immediately . If this is not a King Hu movie , I would have fallen out of my chair laughing at this juvenile turn of events ! Painted skin refers to the makeup that ghosts put on to pretend to be humans , because they're stuck in the middle of two planes . It's always interesting to note that the Chinese believe that when you leave this world , you head straight to hell for judgement and punishment , contrary to Western believes that you get to at least line up at the pearly gates ( and gawk at the saints ) , whether or not you get to enter it after the verdict is passed is a different story altogether . When you're in hell suffering , you will start to long for the time to reincarnate ( whether as a human is also a different story ) , but that's basically the gist . However those stuck in this yin-yang domain , as this story goes , are ruled by an evil spirit called the Yin-Yang King , a faceless creature who later on has someone portraying him to duke it out with the heroes . And the battles here , while choreographed right for excitement , doesn't seem to be sophisticated enough . Bear in mind that this was in the year 1993 , where films like Once Upon a Time in China , and Swordsman II were released . Having what is perceived to be a rehash storyline and setting didn't help either , as audiences probably were tired from the female spirit-male scholar-priests-demon king connection . There's no grandeur fight sequences of epic magnitudes , or memorable scenes such as the chase in a bamboo forest . Here , chases are aplenty , more with the good guys running away from a crazed , powerful demon king , than actually engaging it in meaningful combat . We have multitudes of priest characters here , from the 2 resident bumbling , incompetent ones played by Lau Shun ( who was the evil eunuch in Swordsman ) and Wu Ma , to Sammo Hung as a mysterious High Monk who chooses to hide his identity , and a cameo by the late Lam Ching-Ying ( everyone's favourite Vampire Hunter ) as a Purple Taoist . But despite its almost A-list cast , the story was still all over the place , with flashbacks and truly strange scenes which doesn't add much depth to the story , as if to want to cover a wide breadth versus digging in for depth . If compared to A Touch of Zen ( which seemed to have its ending parodied here in one of the scenes ) , Painted Skin is unfortunately no match on all fronts , and it's actually quite a pity that King Hu should bow out with a lacklustre piece such as this .
514696	317399	826024	2.0	A Nutshell Review : 9 : 56	This is a movie from Toilet Pictures . If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is , then this would be it . I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies , not that I'm chicken , but rather this year alone , I haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far , be it from the West , or from Asia . 9 : 56 is no different , great premise , but poor execution , relying on clich√©d techniques ( I think these are the only tools of the trade available ? ) to try and elicit some heart thumping moments . Se-jin ( Ko So-young ) is a lonely career woman , who one day notices that some apartments in the block of flats opposite hers , undergo blackouts simultaneously at precisely 9 : 56pm everyday . No , she's no voyeur , but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighbourhood , including one which she encounters herself on a subway , start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths . With horror movies , there's always a pseudo-logical explanation within the movie about how the spooks come about . That's just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film , the unravelling of the " Truth " , although it won't take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through . Which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie . There's a myriad of characters like the wheelchair bound girl , and the neighbours who take turns to care for her , as well as a schoolgirl , detective , a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train commuter . But following genre formula , these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths , or in this case , pointless red herring characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to mislead the audience , nevermind if they convolute , or add little to forward the plot . And don't get me started on the techniques employed here . Quick cuts , sudden appearances , long hair ghouls ( ahhhhhhh , so passe ! ) who can't move properly , copious amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free , and the list goes on . But credit to the sound engineers for creating some ear piercing bone crunching sounds used each time the spooks move , though it seems like a one trick pony . Don't waste time on this , even if you're a horror fan . It's a complete waste of a promising premise , and in the end , you feel like you've just be taken on a ride . A very long and painful one to endure . It's high time for some innovation in this genre , otherwise one film will easily look like another , with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds . Oh , and can someone oil those doors while they're at it as well .
514629	317399	454457	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Frostbiten	To think I was once avoiding horror movies because I thought I was chicken . Hell , I now believe the real reason's cause there are so many bad horror movies out there , that it's just not worth the time and money to watch them on the big screen . This Swedish movie unfortunately , is one of them . Frostbiten started off promisingly , with a link back to the horrors of WWII , where soldiers were being cut down in size by the enemies . They stumble onto an unused hut , but before they can get a good night's rest , they realize that there is something mysterious about the entire place , and got attacked by strange creatures . It's quite an extended scene before the opening title , but we get fast forwarded to today . Mother and daughter Annika ( Petra Nielsen ) and Saga ( Grete Havnesk√∂ld ) come to a new town to start life anew , but before they get settled down , it's a mixed bag of incidents which see Annika uncovering a deep dark secret in the hospital she works in , and Saga's teenage friends getting high on an experimental drug without their knowledge , and get turned into vampires . So begins a battle on both fronts as they fend off vampire rejects from Underworld . The story is nothing to shout about , being very weakly made up of lame excuses just to feature the vampires in various fang-sinking-into-necks opportunities . Plenty of things went wrong , right up until its ending , which tried to be too intelligent for its own good with a suggestive open ended ending , and it doesn't make much sense . At times , the movie's littered with humour , but in cheesy ways as it wasn't able to decide whether to be funny , or dead serious with the antics . It's nothing scary , but there were copious amounts of blood used to up the gore factor . Come to think of it , certain production aspects turned out quite childish with its lack of attention to continuity issues , although there were some sparks of brilliance in its special effects department . Other than that , if you really want to experiment with a foreign language horror movie , just wait for the discs to arrive .
515216	317399	371853	3.0	A Nutshell Review : The Nun	This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun ( La Monja ) . Seriously , I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles , even though the story's about the character as described in the title . Who knows , soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk , The Priest , and others belonging to various religious sects . The basic premise goes very simply , that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb ( so that it can lay claim to the title ) goes around killing ex-convent girls . There seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved , as the daughter of one of the victims , Eva ( played by an eye candy Icelandic Anita Briem ) , goes on to discover , with the help of a few good friends , like a rip off of I Know What You Did Last Summer ( mentioned also , by the way ) . So as the body count increases , it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred ( aren't they always ? ) heroine to uncover the truth and save the day . Delving into the sins of the mothers , the movie did the unthinkable , that with a dream sequence as the introduction . I hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly , and there are a couple of them in the movie . In part , the movie played at times like Ju-On gone wrong with the plenty of Dark Water references , and they could have retitled this Unholy Water , for the circumstances and plot points in the movie . However , there are plot holes abound , so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply . You'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun , and sets which look like they can rival recent Thai horror movie Dorm . The acting's pretty forgettable , with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented English . And since most of them are pleasing to the eye , the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch-hunt . What gives ? Hello , got hantu , still got mood ah ? Then again , the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated / SFX which has a built in AI of popping up every now and then , in various fashion , just to elicit screams from timid audiences . The characters also break every unwritten rule in the Do-Nots in horror lore , so you know and expect their just desserts . Can you possibly enjoy this movie ? Sure you can . Just ensure that you're watching it in a full house ( should be easy , since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific ) , and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every " frightening " scene . It's pretty fun , and adds to the atmosphere , besides what's going on the screen . Surround sound doesn't even come close . Think of it as watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the wisecracks , and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating . Those could possibly have been the best bits , now left rotting on the censor's floor board .
515188	317399	256103	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Intimacy	Picture your life this way if you can : You are a regular bloke . You work as a bartender in a pub . Your wife has left you and has custody over your two kids . Your friends are a gay and a totally whacked out stoner . The only thing you look forward to , is the afternoon of Wednesdays . That's when an annonymous female stranger knocks on your door , enters your home and the both of you have sex . Just sex . Nothing else . You don't even talk to each other . Just plain humping . And she leaves after that , leaving you basking in orgasmic pleasure . And that , covers about of the movie . Not just one sex scene , but plenty in between . Nothing fancy , just straight to the point humping . Things start to get complicated when you try to find out more about the life of this stranger , and the viewer is presented the background , motives and rationale behind the two lead characters . That's it . With one final hump , the movie ends . I suppose it's for the arty-farty folks , but heck , i think 90 % of the audience in the sold-out theatre didn't comprehend what the movie is trying to put across .
515365	317399	897361	5.0	A Nutshell Review : I Know Who Killed Me	Maybe because it's Lindsay Lohan's way of telling the cinematic world she's grown up now and would like to be cast in more mature roles , with her taking on dual characters here as all American rich girl next door Aubrey Fleming , and white trash stripperella Dakota Moss . Like Anne Hathaway before her who had shed her clothes to announce her arrival ( in both Brokeback Mountain and Havoc ) , Lohan prances around in skimpy costumes , gyrating on a dance floor showing off her pole moves , but yet stopped short from showing what she has already exposed in real life . Her public demeanours aside , which has seen her flash skin ( intentional or not ) , smoke , drink and drive , all hopes of this movie being her vehicle to show what she can do beyond those cutesy teenage roles , go up in a puff of smoke . I Know Who Killed Me sounds like a cheap cousin of the clich√©d I Know What You Did ( insert favrourite season here ) , and works out for the most parts suffering from multiple personality disorder . It cannot decide whether to be a psychological thriller which tickles the mind , a mystery with tons of smart red herrings thrown about , or a gory torture porn movie which really strayed too close into the Elisha Cuthbert Captivity copycat model . Lohan as Aubrey disappears in a small town which had been rocked by a series of missing girls and bizarre killings . Naturally everyone gets worried that Ms Freckles will become a victim , and when she's found , she suddenly deems herself to be a certain Dakota Moss who have absolutely no idea why folks are claiming otherwise , and assisted by some nifty special effects that somehow just makes your skin crawl . So on everyone's insistence she's not who she claims she is , and going down the road of delusions , I'll actually be quite glad if it took that straightforward path , rather than meander through indecisiveness , showing a little of everything , including cheap shock horror tactics , before providing that all important plot twist to stamp its mark and steer the movie henceforth . Credit though to that twist which was something of interest to me at least , but nothing that had already not been done before . What the story clearly lacked was a strong central villain , instead opting for the obvious clich√©s in playing coy with his identity . The movie throws up a whole truckload of supporting characters , and most of them , especially the police folk who were so involved in cracking the case ala CSI style , gets so conveniently forgotten midway through . Subplots introduced were relying too much on many coincidences , and when they do not logically work out , gets dropped wholesale too . All these boiled down in demonstrating the scatterbrains at work here , in dabbling with and experimenting , but leaving those unwanted test results still in the movie . But as mentioned , I Know Who Killed Me is an avenue for Lohan to show that she's bad , and really really bad . But there's absolutely no need to show she's notorious at flirting with the gardener with her come hither looks in tight clothing . She smokes and she drinks , and doesn't demonstrate anything else beyond being the tabloid fodder she has made out to be in recent times . Watch this if only you enjoy being teased by the local distributors - violence and gore is good and uncut , but love making with clothes on gets the snip for the call of the dough .
515087	317399	369436	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Four Christmases	I can't help but to chuckle at how Brad ( Vince Vaughn ) and Kate ( Reese Witherspoon ) got busted on national television no less , for having everyone whom they have lied to , see exactly where they are - at the airport trying to get to their vacation destination rather than accepting the invitation from their families to spend the season's greetings with . After all , as far as Brad's mantra goes , you can't have families without " lies " . Anyway it is a situation that I'm fairly familiar with , and his reaction when the television camera gets poked in his face , brought back the memory of my own busted moment many years back . As the wafer thin story goes , here is a couple who have spent the last three years in their " honeymoon " period , where everything is fine and dandy , and they seem to be A-OK with their commitment-less agreement and enjoying life as it is with each other . But a fog-ruined holiday meant they have to spend their one-day delay in San Francisco , and play tote the politically correct line in visiting all their divorced parents - that makes it four pit stops to commemorate the festivities , and hence the title - and this led to various inevitable hilarious situations . Such as revisiting the ghosts and skeletons hidden in the homes they each grew up in , and for the first time , for both Brad and Kate to really discover who they once were , and who they are now , warts and all , for the other party to see . In fact , the first two house visits did just that , in presenting their worst nightmares and their attempts to overcome them . Sounds clich√© I know , but that's the gist you get from the entire movie , that it's nothing more than a generic holiday movie where things that can go awry , do . Given that it's a compact under 90 minute film , you'd come to expect that the latter half of the visits suffered from haphazard editing in order to make a mad dash to the finale . And this tells from the way characters magically appear one moment , and disappear the next . Reese Whiterspoon just pales herself against the gigantic Vince Vaughn , and it's quite a curious case of what the filmmakers actually had in mind in casting a really tall Vaughn against a really short Witherspoon , that you can check out those heels she had to deck just to reach his erm , armpits . Vaughn definitely stole her thunder here ( in what was reel reflecting real - you just got to love his rendition of Joseph ) although some of the usual wisecracks did get toned down , and he seemed to be muted for the most parts , instead of being able to run riot with the role . Perhaps the much publicized tiff with his co-star did take its toil after all ? Four Christmases doesn't offer any gifts to the audience , and you're likely to stay one step ahead of the characters all the time . Genuinely funny jokes are rare , and moments of contemplation on the greater good gets mentioned only fleetingly . It's still quite amazing though that the film managed to get on board as supporting characters , the likes of Robert Duvall , Sissy Spacek , Jon Voight , Mary Steenburgen , Kristin Chenoweth , Tim McGraw ( ! ) and even the director of Iron Man Jon Favreau ! So it's enjoy the moment with the supporting characters ( almost all of whom their characters seem a little sexed up ) , in what would be a rather plain film .
514823	317399	768212	5.0	A Nutshell Review : The Last Mimzy	Directed by the current CEO of New Line Cinema , The Last Mimzy is a children's fantasy movie which goes along the grains of having its children protagonists developing special powers , communicating with one another and with an alien object that no adult ( or anyone else for that matter ) can , and to help save some futuristic civilization . Sounds like a typical walk in the park for any children's movie you might add . The Wilder siblings Noah ( Chris O'Neil ) and Emma ( Rhiannon Leigh Wryn ) find a mysterious box with strange markings , containing some weird toys , amongst which includes a harmless looking soft toy bunny christened Mimzy . Soon enough Noah starts developing intellectual prowess bordering on genius and like Peter Parker would do without eyeglasses , while Emma , with Mimzy clutched closely to chest , starts to exhibit powers that a psychic would , in addition to being able to play five stones that float and with a light show included . As parents and adults ( Noah's schoolteacher and his wife ) , they have a natural tendency for disbelief and to second guess the children , as all adults would in a made for children's movie . And the authorities are hunting for them , just as they would , as targets of a resulting city wide blackout . If anything , the chemistry between the child actors playing the siblings is believable enough , and you would agree with me that Rhiannon Leigh Wryn is adorable as the kid sister whose innocence and love play a crucial role in the movie's plot . There are a few moments with injected humour , which I thought Asian audiences would identify with immediately with Kathryn Hahn's role as a " numbers " obsessed lady , and for technical geeks , watch out for that logo ( I've actually had a friend who was expecting it to pop out , and to our surprise , it did ! ) Expect the rudimentary plot development , characters as well as special effects that are just functional rather than to wow . It should serve as pretty interesting for a kid , but for an adult , we would have already seen other more superior stories , beginning with Spielberg's ET .
514699	317399	1016205	5.0	A Nutshell Review : The Mourning Forest	Winning the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival last year , I actually found it a tad difficult to appreciate this piece by Naomi Kawase , as compared to Shara . I am beginning to suspect that I have a profound disengagement with movies that deal with grief and loss , especially when it takes on a very detached approach in some ways with the characters constantly unable to deal with those emotions for the most parts . The movie opened true to Kawase's penchant for capturing moving air . Here , we see lush greenery on tree tops dancing to the motion of wind , and vast open fields where blades of grass sway back and forth when caressed by the breeze . It's like watching a National Geographic episode of forests and greenery before the opening credits kicked in to start the film proper . I even suspected that M Night Shyamalan could have paid homage in his The Happening , which also had plenty of such shots put into it . The story tells of the relationship that formed between Shigeki ( Shigeki Uda ) and Machiko ( Machiko Ono ) , the former an old man in an elderly home who has been aloof after the lost of his wife some 33 years ago . 33 years is an extremely long time , and to miss someone for that long , well , you know how strong his emotions are to his wife . On the other hand , Machiko is a staff at the same elderly home , but she too is grieving internally for the loss of her son , and her husband squarely puts the responsibility and blame on her petite shoulders . While initially starting off on the wrong foot with fiery misunderstanding , they soon hit it off in a game of tag in the great outdoors , where the camera pulls back to reveal again the large open spaces , and the two protagonists finding and connecting with each other , two tiny creatures in the space that Nature offered , only to act as a precursor of a more adventurous outing that would come soon after , in an excursion that took a turn for the unexpected when their car ran into a ditch . In what seemed to be a wandering around aimlessly on foot deep inside nature herself , both Shigeki and Machiko had to depend on each other to keep to their wildlife tour , with the former having the objective of wanting to look for his late wife's grave , like a pilgrimage in itself . The observations from far earlier gives way to a more intimate look at the two , and Shigeki turned into some kind of enigma , clutching his all important haversack , as they go from set piece to set piece , some quaintly quiet , while others I seem to make no headway from sudden outbursts which persisted as being more whiny than anything else . Might be a masterpiece for some to appreciate , especially with its beautiful cinematography , but everything else was certainly lost on me probably due to my lack of extreme patience , and I grief in not being able to be moved by this movie .
515359	317399	427392	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Invasion	It seems like Nicole Kidman's The Invasion is something like a tit-for-tat response to ex Mr Nicole Kidman's War of the Worlds . Aliens from outer space , check . Estranged spouse ( the cinematic one that is ) , check . Cute toddler kid , check . Being the only one who figures what could be going on , check . Lots of running , check . Single parent power , check . Having people clamour on your escape vehicle , check . Cop out Hollywood styled ending mocking the aliens , check . Pointless remake ? Probably not , and that's its leg up against the tripods . The Invasion is an update to the many movies based on Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers , and the last movie I can remember about the same was the one starring Garbrielle Anwar ( that beautiful lady who tango-ed with Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman , and together like Chris O'Donnell , has already faded from the limelight ) . At its core the story's about how alien lifeforms start to take control of human beings by being their doppelgangers , and with behaviour like a Stepford Wife , it's definitely not appreciated by those who value their freedom and the ability to choose . The movie did try to elevate itself from the run of the mill thrillers , in putting in not so sublime anti-war-anti-terror messages . In its cinematic world , the war on Iraq is over with the US troop pullout , and the Koreas get unified . That's because the aliens have taken over and taught us truly what world peace is all about . And therein lies the issue - if we're beings who strive for the greater good , why not let the aliens take over , instead of resisting and insisting on continuing our flawed existence ? A human utopia is impossible , given our human nature to suspect , fight , and kill each other . Borg-like assimilation however , we cannot accept . So Nicole Kidman's psychiatrist Carol Bennell and Daniel Craig's doctor Ben Driscoll ( who looks just very Blond here in bland Bond like moments ) seem to be the few who would take a long time being found out to be puny humans , and battle it out with the aliens in a hide and seek cat and mouse game , together with cute kid Jackson Bond as Carol's son Oliver . You cannot sleep , and you cannot show emotion , lest you be pinned down , given a taste of a tazer , turn into a cocoon and wake up a new person . The movie does have its fair share of excitable moments , contrary to what I would have believed from other opinions of the movie , and there are genuine , effective jump at your seat episodes . While Craig is bland , Nicole Kidman is reason enough to watch the movie as firstly , she illuminates the screen with her gorgeous poise , even when she's trying to be robot like , or running around with kid in tow frantically trying to save their souls from zombie-like humans , who thankfully subscribe to the George A Romero model rather than the Danny Boyle one ( though I would have loved to see more energetic aliens takeover than the docile world-peace loving ones here ) . My greatest beef with the show however , is how everything must be ended nicely , bright sunshine and all . Woefully typical , instead of my personal preference for an apocalyptic styled one . Perhaps therein lies the belief that we humans can provide the fix for our flaws , in good time to come , as Carol Bennell so confidently states early in the movie .
514809	317399	792965	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Hunting and Gathering	It's Audrey Tautou , and ever since Amelie , I am of the opinion that Singaporeans have an affinity for the pint sized actress , and her box office draw here is fairly strong . Count me in as one of the fans who will lap up her cinematic outings , good or bad , so long as our heroine gets the opportunity to shine on screen . Hunting and Gathering is based on a novel by Anna Gavalda , and tells the story of four individuals whose lives converge in an apartment . In this movie directed by Claude Berri , I thought that it was split into 3 acts , with story arcs focused on the challenges faced by each of the characters . Tautou stars as Camille Fauque , a near anorexic surface engineer who smokes a lot , guzzles alcohol , but eats very little . Living alone in a small attic of an apartment block , she meets Philibert ( Laurent Stocker ) , a fellow neighbour who suffers from bouts of anxiety . Philibert's housemate Franck ( Guillaume Canet ) is a chef who lives hard and fast , whose only worry is the welfare of his grandmother Paulette ( Francoise Bertin ) , a senior citizen who fears being tossed aside by kin , and makes life quite difficult for her caretakers . The narrative is quite plain actually , with every conceivable development being very predictable . That means no quirky twists and turns for the sake of it , and it actually allows you to shift to lower gears to enjoy this outing . It's a story about having dreams , fulfilling them , and helping others to fulfill theirs too , through encouragement and support rendered . Having all four characters together under one roof , though brief it might be , did seem like an episode of Friends gone all French and all whacked with the age grouping , and proving correct the adage that two's a company and three's a crowd . It did try to cover a lot of ground given that there are a number of characters here , but it did so at the expense of depth . The romance entanglements between characters did seem rather superficial , bland , trivial and predictable , while Philibert's quest to stem out his stammering through stage acting unfortunately had to take the backseat , and thus having his character fade away somewhat for the last act of the movie . The most meaningful and beautiful arc here belongs to Francoise Bertin's Paulette , as her tale of fear of abandonment rings through very honestly , and somehow , you'll start to wonder when you're of old age , whether you will have companions whom you can get along with , or be forgotten and tossed to some old folks ' home to spend your twilight years in . I felt that it was superiorly poignant , without which there would be no emotional anchor for this movie . Somehow , movies that feature food and classy restaurants ( Ratatouille , Mostly Martha and No Reservations anyone ? ) of late that I've watched always have fallen into the clich√©d ending . I'm unsure if it's an unwritten rule to have it done so , or if it's a formula that has proved to work every time . But in all earnestness , I thought it ended quite nicely with that happily ever after feel . In summary , definitely worth a watch for the eye candy cast , but it plays like a generic romantic / friendship tale that possesses potential that was hardly scratched .
515345	317399	43587	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Ginza Cosmetics	The opening shots of this movie firmly puts it in the Ginza district of Tokyo back in 1951 , with its distinct landmark of the Clock Tower , and serves kind of like a documentary snapshot of the district with following the kid Haruo in and around the area , before finally we get to meet his mom Yukiko ( Kinuyo Tanaka ) , a bar hostess struggling to make ends meet . Directed by Mikio Naruse , this movie doesn't have any big moments , and feels like a capture of the relatively mundane life of Yukiko , in her luckless meeting with various men who seem always to disappoint , and her taking care of her only son . These are acute observations that represent that slice of life , and doesn't over-dramatize or wallow in melodrama and the theatrics , which is quite commendable , given the usual tendency for movies of the genre to lapse into . Things happen as a matter of fact , right up until the tense and anxious moments of looking for a runaway kid . Kinuyo Tanaka brings forth a quiet , stoic demeanour in her Yukiko , being unable to change her fate of being a single mother , and she could make you wring your heart as we experience together with Yukiko a potential moment of probably romance with a young man flit away , despite initial reluctance to get acquainted and help out in his stay in Tokyo . I thought it was quite magnanimous of her to do what she did , and felt that it was really sad for one to resign to her fate without any inclination to challenge it with the hope that things might be for the better . If you prefer your movies quiet , with the dignified presence of a star actress at her element , then perhaps Ginza Cosmetics would be a launchpad for anyone interested in following the filmography of director Mikio Naruse , and of his many film collaborations with Kinuyo Tanaka .
514806	317399	361127	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Woodsman	( This is one of the tough reviews I've had - the material is tough , and having seated beside a cute chick in the theatre ain't helping bucketloads ) The Woodsman gets its name from a fairy tale - Little Red Riding Hood , you know , the dude who actually cut the wolf and out came red riding hood , alive and well . The woodsman ( and his axe ) gave red riding hood a chance to live another day . Does society give second chances to criminals , criminals like Walter , convicted of child molest ? Released on supervised parole , Walter tries hard to reintegrate back to society . Police knocks at his door anytime , snarling . Frequent visits to his psychiatrist is a must . Getting a job is based on whatever network he has left , and willing to accept him with the condition that he doesn't screw up . Colleagues belittle him . Relatives shun him , sometimes mock him . And yet Walter tries , hard . He knows it is an illness in the mind he has to conquer . And he sees this sickness manifest itself in a strange man whom he calls " Candy " , who loiters outside the school courtyard outside his home - he understands what " Candy " is up to , setting traps for young boys , with the aim of violating them . He is disgusted , but the reason why he understands what's going on , is because he's such a person himself . " It takes a thief to catch a thief " doesn't ring any truer than this . But not all is gloom , as he hooks up with Vickie , a colleague At his workplace . Vickie is his pillar of strength ( in a way ) , and yes , she too comes along with plenty of emotional baggage ( seems like all the characters in this movie are really screwed one way or another ) The finale is gripping , as we see Walter being tempted by a young girl , who's undergoing some really painful relationships back home . Will Walter falter , or will he find moral courage to resist ? And what will happen to Candy ? And will Walter find what he's looking for with Vickie ? The highlight here is Kevin Bacon , perhaps the most underrated character actor ever in Hollywood . His measured performance made it so believable that hey , you just pity the guy Walter he's playing . This movie is an acquired taste , though I must warn you the movie takes its time to tell its story ( even though it clocks in at about 90 mins ) . And oh , don't get me started on the 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon !
514706	317399	297905	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Harmful Insect	I wonder what the English title of Harmful Insect alluded to , as I usually associate critters that do no good as pests , deserving of the right sole of boot , or that slap of a rolled up newspaper . Unless of course it referred to a couple of characters in the movie big or small , with the latter made up of lecherous men who can't wait to proposition the helpless school girl at every step of the way . Perhaps it made reference to somewhat frail creatures , who with the right tools and misguidance , able to do a lot of harm that for the particular crazed moment , they cannot comprehend the severity of their deeds . Directed by Akihiro Shiota , Harmful Insect tells the story of a young schoolgirl Sachiko Kita ( Aoi Miyazaki ) , whose father has mortally left her , and her suicidal mother compounding the problems that come with a broken home by her extreme mood swings , and hooking up with a boyfriend whom we know spells trouble from day one . We see that she skips school , and spends her days wandering the streets with a new found friend in a teenage delinquent , and Mr Kyuzo ( Koji Ichikawa ) a vagrant who is none too bright . Possibly her first real friends with whom she is able to connect , we see her happier days in a lingering , unspoken suggestion of romance , as well as a semblance of a dysfunctional family of sorts to belong to . They hang out , have fun , and even come up with dangerous though innovative ways to survive and " make a living " . Her tale can be broken into 3 acts , with the first being as described , dealing with her alienation from her proper place in society , in the school courtyard , and the second dwelling on attempts at trying to bring her back to where she belonged , thanks to the relentless efforts of her non-judgemental neighbour Natsuko ( Yu Aoi ) , who turns out to be a pillar of strength for the girl , and her appointed guardian angel . I thought Natsuko as a character was a somewhat strong contrast to Sachiko , which you can tell from the very brief moments they interact , and even the kind of happier home that Natsuko comes from , in a scene so short , but tells a lot . And what more the act of self-sacrifice in giving up someone she loves ( ok , so it might be puppy and even though debatable , you get the point ) just to ensure that her friend finds some balance in her life , and to having someone else look out for her too . But Sachiko's Miss Unpopular stigma gets stronger from an attempted act of violence , which leads us to the third and final act , with her flight from trauma . By now , events that develop on screen would already become quite episodic , as the story reads like a book , and plot threads open and close like a turning of a page . All these while we peer at letters written to a certain Mr Ogata ( Seiichi Tanabe ) , which reads like diary entries explaining the inner thoughts of Sachiko , though I have to admit that at times they do seem abstract enough , and out of place . While generally a quiet , slow moving movie , the sound design here alternates between tranquility , and really hard hitting loud noises ranging from falling marbles , banging on doors , the dragging of chairs in class , to the random jets flying overhead . Likely in echo of the character's state of mind , these loud noises do jolt you up from its peacefulness , knowing that there's always something negative brewing on the horizon . But while you think that the narrative's quite sedate , the payload actually gets delivered at the end , as you're likely to start to realize that you've been brought along for an exasperating journey all this while . By the time the last 5 minutes play out and the end credits roll , you can't help but to feel a sense of pity , and anger even , at her giving up of hope , and falling into a web of deceit that she'll probably never be able to crawl out from . Then again , I'm second guessing that it's because of my negative nature adopted when viewing the story from tinted lenses made so by earlier unfortunate episodes of Sachiko's encounters with the wrong type of men , of being the kind of helpless schoolgirl jail bait that gets dangled in front of desperadoes . For all I know , she might be offered a job at a departmental store , or a fast food outlet . But who am I to kid ? Harmful Insect isn't that easy to sit through given its rather bleak nature , although its run time seemed to be a breezy less than 90 minute movie , which was anything but . You can feel its length as it keeps you guessing at some parts before providing you clear answers . But it will make you think in depth of the character of Sachiko and her possible aftermath , way after the end credits roll .
515291	317399	338679	6.0	A Nutshell Review : A Class To Remember IV : Fifteen	I'm not too sure why Gakko III wasn't selected for the festival . It could be that it was too much of the same with its teacher-student-school trinity . Or probably the subject matter wasn't diverse enough for it to be differentiated for an audience already seen the first two , and still being fresh in the minds . And Gakko IV - Fifteen , is very much different from the first two Gakko movies , in that it is not set within the confines of a school compound . Rather , this movie has legs , given that it's a road movie , and has its protagonist , 15 ( obviously ) year old Daisuke ( Yuta Kanai ) running away from home to go on the road , in search of a 7000 year old Cedar tree in Yakushima island . Road trips stick to a formula , that you will encounter strange , quirky people along the way ( that's what makes it interesting ) , and somehow have your lives touching each other's because Fate would only have it that way . You have the usual unfriendly bunch , and portrayals of those whom you will also like to meet up with , should you embark on a road trip yourself . Thumbing and hitchhiking his way , with little money and possession , Daisuke totally hates school , and this is something that any teenager could identify with . But don't forget , Life , or living Life , is probably the best school there is . Throughout his journey , Daisuke meets up with people whom he will affect ( for the better ) , and vice versa . The most memorable , and probably having the longest screen time devoted , will be his meeting with a woman trucker ( Rei Asami ) , who , out of pity and curiosity , brings Daisuke home to provide him with temporal shelter and food . How Daisuke affected her family , with his bonding and bringing out the reclusive son , somehow worked wonders and cemented the theme of friendship in this story . At the end of the day , personal relationships get healed , and one of the most touching moments was the expected run in with his family , especially his dad , at the end of the unannounced journey . That scene alone , with its relatively quiet moments , with subtle gestures , and almost muted feelings of regret , is very powerful indeed . That scene alone , is a worthy finale , and worthwhile in investing time to watching this .
515178	317399	427968	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Trust the Man	When I saw the trailer for this film earlier this year , I placed it under my radar to watch if it makes its way here . I would like to have loved this film , but try as I may , I just couldn't . Not that it's a bad film , but it had too much cramped into it , with subplots flying off in various directions , and the flow just feels too bloated . It's been some time since we last saw David Duchovny on screen . I'm a fan of his Fox Mulder , but after the series ended , it seemed that he has difficulty securing regular appearances in movies these days . He doesn't seem to age , and his latest outing in this movie is testament to that , save for that bearded look toward the end . His character , Tom , is interesting enough as the sex addict ( yeah , you read that right ) , who just can't get enough of the hot and heavy from his wife Rebecca , played by Julianne Moore . For this couple , we look at their marital woes , or woes that exist but always swept and kept under the carpet . It doesn't help when husband and wife reverses roles , with him becoming a house husband with plenty of time in his hands , and she spending long hours away with her theatre rehearsals . And when an attractive divorc√©e comes into the picture , all hell breaks loose of course . Written and directed by director Bart Freundlich ( real life husband of Julianne Moore ) , the story contrasts this couple with another , that of Tobey ( Billy Crudup ) and Elaine ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) . They are your perennial long term dating pair , with one eager to tie the knot , while the other just being commitment phobic . The hairline cracks finally give way , and we go into deep examination of the doom and gloom , the familiarity and the taking for granted , your other half . There's plenty of dialogue in this movie , but don't expect most of them to be funny all the time . No quality wisecracks can be found here . While some are humorous , they come off rather contrived . Many scenes are also set around the ( dinner ) table , which offers the perfect opportunity for the characters to get together and share their thoughts , being conveniently related to one another , through blood relations and friendship . What's interesting though , is the reminder constantly played throughout , about the need to be totally honest about each other , even though this will mean having to declare things you know will definitely hurt . A cry for help shouldn't be blown away . Again there are plenty more scenes shot which didn't make it to the final cut , and the editing was not slick enough to cover up these open end hanging feeling between scenes . A whole host of supporting cast like Gary Shandling and Eva Mendes amongst others , get so minuscule a role , they just adds to the needless character count , and contribute to the fat not required in story development . But if you think you're in need of some serious romance drama , and potentially the need to reaffirm your love for someone , or in the mood for some discussions about the various themes put across - of love , faith , lust and sex , then Trust the Man will be your clear choice this week .
514718	317399	74751	6.0	A Nutshell Review : King Kong ( 1976 )	This movie is as old as I am , but it's not the original . Yes you heard me right . The original big gorilla debut in 1933 . and this is a remake . Unless you've been residing in Mars , you'll also know that Peter Jackson will be adapting King Kong for the big screen for a release next month , and thank heavens it's closely based on the original . While this film also adapts from the same source material by Merian C . Cooper and Edgar Wallace , it has taken certain liberties and artistic license to change some character backgrounds and premise . For example , the film crew has been replaced with oil prospectors , and the blonde lass doesn't start off the journey with the team , but actually plucked out unconscious from the sea , an actress wannabe who didn't enjoy Deep Throat ( don't ask ) . Gone too is the iconic scene atop the Empire States Building , now Kong scales the World Trade Center and hops between the two towers ( alas , September 11 changed it all ) . However , this movie still retained much of the story's structure - team ventures into island , chances upon island inhabitants , inhabitants kidnap blonde lass as a sacrifice to the great Kong , the beauty and the beast sequence , the capture of Kong , bringing him back to New York , and all hell breaks loose . Just not quite . This Kong is quite benign in nature , and only goes berserk when jealousy makes him go on a rampage against those trying to prise his lass away from him . The effects look dated if you watch them today , and the animatronics probably made a giant ape hand - that's the only mechanical limb you get to see up close , the rest can be figured as a man in a rubber suit , captured using various techniques to achieve the desired proportions for size . Don't go scrutinizing the plot too , as there are gaping loopholes , and plenty of minor characters . Oh , Singapore's mentioned a lot of times in the first twenty minutes , as the ship crew navigates from Surabaya , Indonesia en route to looking for oil . Starring a very young and very hairy Jeff Bridges in the role of a professor / ape expert , this movie is probably famous for introducing a very nubile Jessica Lange in her first feature film . She could be considered as the Jessica Simpson of that era , having prancing around the island in hot pants and tank tops , various strapless gowns and in wet island garb , which gave way to a wardrobe malfunction when Kong molested her with its finger ( don't ask - the ape's probably horny too ) . So while awaiting Peter Jackson's masterpiece , why not get your hands on this adapted classic too ? Good for compare , contrast , but don't go bananas over this one if it doesn't meet your expectations .
515529	317399	377818	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Dukes of Hazzard	Remakes are getting popular in Hollywood , be they adapted from existing Asian films like Infernal Affairs , or digging into their own nostalgic TV series . This remake doesn't take itself too seriously , as we revisit the Dukes of Hazzard County - Cousins Luke , Bo , Daisy and Uncle Jessie . In a short span of 10 minutes , we get introduced to the boys and their moonshine running , their penchant for running into trouble , the bickering banter , and got the opportunity to see Daisy up close and personal in the bar . The plot's a bit flimsy , nothing too intelligent - baddie Boss Hogg buys up farmland in Hazzard in an attempt to turn Hazzard into a humongous coal mining town , and it's up to the Duke boys to stop him from achieving his objective . It plays out simply like a chess game , with moves and countermoves from both sides , but no prizes for guessing who always come up tops . There are plenty of stars in this remake film . Johnny Knoxville , better known as the creator-writer of the TV series Jackass , stars as Luke Duke . Sean Williams Scott seems to be dangerously type-casted into smarty-pants or dumb jock roles , given his filmography filled with American Pies , and asking Where's his Car in Road Trips . Thankfully , there is some chemistry between them to make this film bearable . For any hot-blooded male , the female dormitory scene will probably bring on the laughs , Jessica Simpson has been aptly highlighted ( or rather , her assets were ) in the trailers , and as Daisy Duke , she gets to flaunt her assets a lot in this film , in various hot pants , bikinis and undress . It gets tired after a while , as Daisy Duke turned more into a bimbo than anything else . Not that I'm not enjoying every moment of it though . Willie Nelson completes the Duke family as Uncle Jessie , and you'd half expect him to break out into song , which he did , for a short while , during the end credits . The villains are over the top , with Burt Reynolds really adding the cheese as Hogg . But the real star of the show is that red hot " General Lee " Dodge Charger car which leaps over so many ramps placed throughout the movie on purpose . The Dixie horn gets tooted a number of times too , just for the sake of drumming it in that hey , it's like the TV series . The cinematography for General Lee challenges flicks like The Fast and The Furious , and even gives Initial D's " drifting " a run for its money , performing the drifting stunt not in lonely mountain roads , but in busy city streets . Hats off to the stunt drivers , and for wreaking quite a number of the cars as seen in the making of clips in the closing credits . The Dukes of Hazzard gamely captures some elements in the TV series , but the movie doesn't offer anything much refreshing . While enjoyable , there isn't much to take away from this comedy , and is forgettable once you're out of the theatre .
515139	317399	1194624	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Sniper	If not for the picture scandal , this film would have been released about a year ago , and would likely have solidified Edison Chen's position as box office draw given his stellar performance in crime-action flicks like Dog Eat Dog and Blood Brothers , and pop idol fare such as Initial D . But we know what had happened over the span of a year , though I suppose the decision to hold this film back would have helped it in increasing the curiosity surrounding this , given his last / first performance since the scandal . After all , the producers have to make the best out of the situation . His character in Sniper is a typical Edison Chen persona ? young , brash and impatient , toeing the line of the good and possessing that streak of arrogance . As OJ , he aspires to be the top shooter amongst the SDU Sniper Unit , and is mentored by the team leader Hartman ( Richie Jen , who also starred as a sharpshooter in Johnnie To's Exiled ) who discovered him during a mission , and is impressed by the upstart . Given the attributes of a sniper ? confidence , decisiveness and ruthlessly accurate , egos are swelled and clashes are part of the game , where while it's a team effort , you can't deny those strong individual desire to excel above the rest . The unfinished business of the earlier generation comes back to haunt the team in the form of the disgraced , and once top shooter Lincoln ( Huang Xiaoming ) , who in a rash , negligent act gets sentenced to imprisonment , and upon release swears revenge on his once buddies . For a moment there was a tussle for the apprentice ala Star Wars style , where the young one found his training under his mentor too stifling and never appreciative of his abilities , and on the other , darker side , becomes seduced by sexier techniques which seem to be the path toward instant results and glory . But alas the story unfortunately becomes quite fluffy , with the dramatic moments just excuses to string the action sequences together . The runtime under 90 minutes also provided a feeling that the film has been super summarized , given a lot of sub plots being introduced briefly , but never really reaching second base , especially with the relationships of the snipers and the opposite sex . You would wonder why they had even bothered to devote time to this aspect , just to know that the crazed nut Lincoln is terribly infatuated with his girlfriend , OJ's girlfriend is a one scene wonder , and Hartman's estranged wife lies comatose most of the time , waking only to shed tears and raise her voice . I guess in a sniper's life , the only " wife " they take care of , as in the prologue , is their rifles , to protect it with their life or professionally , they're screwed . Dante Lam's star has been shining rather brightly , and I have enjoyed his recent effort in Beast Stalker . Here , he crafted some wonderful sniper action scenes without resorting too much on the looking-through-the-scope syndrome , striking a balance in being instructional , yet adequately paced to be tension-filled . What I appreciated is his fusion of that psychological element a sniper brings to the table , of the ability of how one man well hidden , and well trained , can take out a platoon or company , because of that element of fear that is introduced . Too bad for the many cardboard supporting villains and victims though , and that strange need to CG some dark clouds and fake lightning to drape many scenes . Undoubtedly the show belongs to the ensemble cast in oozing machismo as they do battle , but you can't help but to feel that it is Edison who's pulling in the crowds in what could be his last hurrah . In a cruel twist of irony , his character here can't wait to talk to and provide snide remarks to the media , which is a far cry in the real situation he's in now . One can only wonder how things would have turned out if not for that moment of accidental folly .
515344	317399	803057	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Promotion	One job , two candidates , you know the drill , especially when the offer is one that comes with a better job title , and with it , better renumeration , to move upwards in the corporate ladder , and to gain some foothold in keeping up with the Joneses . The last time I watched a film primarily set in a supermarket was Cashback , and that became one of my favourite films of last year . Alas The Promotion , written and directed by Steve Conrad , had similar flair in telling the story of one man's struggle for economic betterment , but somehow lacked enough depth in material to what is essentially a tired formula . You know , the one-upmanship that two parties having a go at each other , pulling no punches in order to get ahead . Strangely enough , these acts of sabotage are few and far between , and didn't come off as either funny or essential , but more like that of desperation . Seann William Scott can never seem to be able to break out from his jock role , though his Doug Stauber tried hard to carry the movie through by sharing with the audience his hopes and dreams , of being stuck in a dead end routine job with an incompetent boss . Opportunity arose from his employer's franchise opening another outlet , and therein lies his chance for promotion , better salary , and to move out of his current home next door to banjo-merry-makers so that he can make love to his wife Jen ( Jenna Fischer ) in peace . With opportunity comes obstacle , and is personified by John C . Reilly's Richard Welhner from the supermarket's sister company in Canada , and he too is eying that job so that he can feed his family and provide them the nice to haves like various enrichment classes . He has help from a self-help audio book , and honestly , I think those books are a load of bull , and had already made first cut of your money through your purchase of it . Anyway , the crux of the movie laid in the two of them second guessing each other's intention , but all the while when trying to sabotage one another , seem to have conscience prick them all the time , which led to half-hearted attempts without following through . In fact , they seem to pull off more stunts that backfire on themselves , rather than at the other person . It portrays that we are all sensible creatures , and we need not resort to low down and cheap tricks to derail another's rice bowl . That said though the story's very much in lala-land , because the real world out there , just isn't so kind , if at all . Just about everything's predictable in the movie where it's about the length anyone would go to bring home the bacon . Nothing fancy in the movie , but it does have a certain honest though mundane feel about it .
515525	317399	408345	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Firewall	I was quite surprised that Massive Attack's Angel was chosen to accompany the opening credits , which consisted for mostly CCTV / voyeuristic shots of a team conducting surveillance on the movements of Harrison Ford's Jack Stanfield and his family . I know it's a cool track , but Angel is perhaps becoming one of the more overused tracks in Hollywood pictures already . But it hints well at what Firewall is going to become . Clich√© and overused sequences which will probably make you scream " haven't I seen this somewhere before " ? Firewall offered nothing very new in terms of plot outline , as it contains modified scenes from even Ford's own works like Air Force One ( the family's survival being threatened , and it's up to one man to save the day ) and The Fugitive ( the frame up and one man's run from the law ) . Ford has already become comfortable in the role of an all-American one man hero , that this role offered no surprises at all . It's basically standard fare with the usual chases and action fight sequences . Stansfield is a VP of ( network ) security of a bank , and has designed the bank's software , with other operational duties like making sure the bank can respond to external online threats . However , as the saying goes , almost 80 % of intrusion are committed knowingly or unknowingly from the inside , and with a head honcho part of the act , you can be sure that he has the know-how to siphon out cash if he wants to . In comes Bill Cox ( Paul Bettany ) , scheming con man , who with his team of merry men , take Stanfield's family hostage and lapses into the usual psycho-mumbo-jumbo routine . With the family's antics at escaping , you really wonder if Cox , as a villain , has what it takes to call the shots in a hostage situation . While he might have the upper hand , it's his weakness in being ruthless to the hostages that proved his downfall , and make him a very weak cinematic villain . Here's someone who would rather shoot at his own men than to teach them hostages a lesson . Probably he has this noble subscription to " women and children first " . And it doesn't help when there's the usual good guy amongst his merry men who offers the family sympathy points . Word of caution though , for those who might think that this film offers some cool technology on screen . Leave the techno-babble at the door , there's no " firewall " to hack into in the first place , and the " hacking " is actually a no-brainer . And unless the USA offers wireless internet access like everywhere , it's pretty incredible with what a laptop can do in the movie . It has your expected twists and seemingly smart moments , but nothing that will truly make you go " wow " . The fist fight choreography can get pretty intense , however , there's no need to reach the end of the road before you know who's gonna emerge tops . It isn't exactly a bad movie , but one which doesn't even have a single sequence that can redeem this picture from really bad mediocrity .
514537	317399	419706	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Doom	You are in the wrong movie if you ask for a plot in Doom . If there's any , it stays true to the game - shoot anything that breathes , which is uttered many times in the latest movie adapted from computer games , off the heels of Resident Evil and Tomb Raider . I might try - a group of RRTS troops ( read : Universal Soldier type , it even plays out that way ) gets sent to Mars to uncover some weird occurrences in some high tech lab dealing with genetics . Soon , the victims become mutations of various kinds and all hell breaks loose as we follow the crew into the labyrinth of an underground lab full of dark skanky corridors right off the set of Aliens . It's nothing fancy , but it works . The filmmakers try to up both the intelligence and babe factor by introducing Bond Girl Rosamund Pike ( she's a distraction alright ) to the plot , but her ahem assets fail to maximise the thin plot . With mercenary soldiers , we see the typical stereotyped characters like the rookie , the maverick , the questionable orders , and the hero with a buried past . One major gripe I had with this movie , is the language . If the scripts says to swear , then please swear using as much colourful and vulgar words . Don't have it filmed , then decide during post production to tone it down , which means to re-record the audio and dub it over . So The Rock might mouth an " F-word " , doesn't take a genius to realize that the word finally heard - " idiot " is two-syllable , and makes the movie like one of the old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns . Plenty of moments like this . Worse , while Rosamund Pike was uttering a slew of scientific mumbo-jumbo , her mouth doesn't even move ! ! ! The editors need to be shot up the rear by the BFG . Speaking of BFG , it's disappointing . For fans , this is THE weapon to use as you blast away anything that moves . In the film , the buildup , fanfare and respect given to the Big Fat Gun ( as The Rock calls it . I know you fans have a more impolite name for it ) doesn't justify its short life-span on screen . Worse , there's only ONE BFG used in the entire movie , for a total of like , 2 shots ? The much touted first-person shooter ( FPS ) view , adapted straight from the game , turned out to be no longer than 5 minutes . So for all you viewers who are worrying that the FPS view will get you all nauseous , you might want to reconsider . I thought it could be longer , and earlier , but it wasn't . Pity . However , the special effects , for what it's worth , is pretty nifty . Well , this area isn't much of a challenge , having source material come from a computer game , you couldn't and shouldn't do much wrong here . Strictly for fans of the game to see how it's played out on screen , and for those who like a dose of some mindless action , led by The Rock . Hmm . . . did I just see him raise his eyebrow ?
515384	317399	489282	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Strange Wilderness	One of the reasons why I decided to watch this , is because I needed a comedy to laugh at , if it's not possible to laugh together with it . The DVD is already available at the shops , but I don't think I'm ready to fork out a Code 1 DVD price for what's essentially a short comedic film which is based from a Saturday Night Life comedy skit . Written by the same creative team of Peter Gaulke and Fred Wolf with the latter taking on directorial duties as well , Strange Wilderness delivered some genuine laughs , but only if you're tolerant of being insensitive to the kind of subject the film makes fun of . Strange Wilderness is a long running wildlife programme which is now succeeded by Peter ( Steve Zahn ) , the host of the show , whose father had made the programme into one of the best loved prime time shows . Under Peter's leadership , ratings have plummeted , and needless to say even their 3am timeslot is in danger of being canceled . In a last minute desperation for survival , he and his crew have to look for a new way to ensure their programme continues , and dropped at their laps is the opportunity to follow up on a solid lead to the whereabouts of Bigfoot . Eseentially this movie is one big road trip that tells of the crew's journey to documentary history , with the likes of soundman and co-collaborator Fred ( Allen Covert ) , Cooker ( Jonah Hill ) , the only female in the team Cheryl ( Ashley Scott ) , and cameraman Junior ( Justin Long ) , amongst others . And throughout the movie , we see each and everyone of them getting into enough funny scenarios that made this film look like many pieces of skits being glued together , with laughs coming courtesy of sexual innuendos ( you just got to hand it to the turkey ) , sight gags , slapstick and just plain buffoony . In fact , I even suspect that everyone in the cast were on a high as they shot this , as dialogues were laced quite incoherently with plenty of ad-libbing , especially Justin Long , though of course if he's really acting , then kudos to him for being stoned all the time . While giving no respect to wildlife , the funniest moments were reserved for their voice overs of Nature , and it's really quite incredible should anything like it be actually aired for television . They are intentionally full of factual errors , lapse into unnecessary judgmental and slanted viewpoints , but always just plain ridiculously funny . Perhaps I was in crap mode , but the humor here doesn't apologize for any offence made , since after all , the subject matter can't fight back anyway . I know I'm shallow if I say I really couldn't get enough of the film poking fun at the physical features / defects repeatedly . There is no plot in the movie , besides everyone being perpetually broke as they try and scrimp or come out with more hare-brained ideas to fund their movie and fuel the laughs . So the bottomline is , don't expect any genius from Strange Wilderness , but if you're in for some low-brow humor , then this movie might just be the perfect laughing medicine for anyone wanting to chase the blues away , without any medicinal assistance .
514393	317399	1406146	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Call Me If You Need Me	It's an open secret that James Lee gets a lot of love from the Singapore International Film Festival , having almost all , if not all I believe , of his works screened at past editions . Last year we had a rare glimpse of a commercial horror project , Hysteria , and this year Lee goes back to his festival art house roots with Call Me If You Can , a gangster based film tackling the usual themes of Brotherhood and Loyalty that are staple of Hong Kong crime dramas , but without much blazing shootout action . It's an atmospheric family piece if you will , where blood runs thicker than water in episodes that we'll see unfold in Or Kia ( played by Singapore's indie hero Sunny Pang ) leaving his village for the big city of Kuala Lumpur , where he looks up his cousin Ah Soon ( played by Malaysian musician Pete Teo ) who runs a local racket of profit sharing from debt collecting from the bigger fish . In fact , what seemed like a family gathering of relatives soon pave way toward something more sinister , where underlings form part of the family table , and cocktail drugs get passed around as recreational dessert . Watching the first act , I can't help but to think of Tarantino's Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield talking about Royale with Cheese and foot massages whilst on their way to a hit job . Here , Lee has his characters talking like your everyday Joe with everyday worries , hopes and their hobbies , bitching about how comic book creators sell out by prolonging their material through the stuffing their stories with incredible characters . Or characters breaking out into talking about boxing , or even football betting odds . Curiously enough , Lee also put in a lot of hungry people in the film , probably as a metaphor that they're craving something in life , but are not going to get it as easy as a 2-minute instant noodle , or to buy it off the streets from hawkers . Between the 2 acts , I very much prefer the first half to the second , because the second departed from the warm and cozy environment that the cousins are used to , and propel them forward given that their racket together had yielded results , and results meant promotions . Since it's family , Ah Soon hands over his operations to Or Kia , and we see a development of their characters for the worst , and not having both on screen together meant some of the fun dissipating , especially when Ah Soon starts to mope , brood and become exasperated because of his missing wife . And like all gangster movies , personal and business doesn't mix , and a handful of characters had made the business component very clear . It's nice to see how James Lee tackles the issues of corruption in the city indirectly . One scene I thought which was brilliant , was how he confirms a cafe meeting with a high-ranking police officer and the hoodlums . The bribery taking place is not so subtle , yet enough to bring out awareness that the man hiding behind the shades was an officer of the law , through an implied remark of a game found in an iPhone . Folks arrested are also easily let off the hook through the usage of an underaged fall guy , with the corrupt contacts fully condoning such practice . I guess there would be some reference of such practices that Lee would probably be aware of , to have incorporated this in the film . Those looking for a violent , action-packed movie need be reminded that this is a James Lee movie . Guns are brandied around , but rarely used . Instead , the characters rely heavily on a lot of swearing in a myriad of languages , and plenty of cigarette smoke to get their points across . Violence happens off screen , so you don't get to see much . But that's not what you should be looking out for in the movie . The key component that worked is the excellent chemistry that Sunny Pang and Pete Teo share in the movie , as cousins who are more like brothers , and lighting up the screen each time they share the same frame . There is word that James will be working with Sunny again , this time in a commercial action film , and I secretly wish that Pang and Teo could be reunited again for the big screen .
515508	317399	439815	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Slither	We've seen a slew of horrific gore movies hitting the screens lately , from Saw to Hostel , some hits , some misses , some remakes , brought to us by a new age group of horror directors like Darren Lynn Bousman , Eli Roth and Alexandre Aja . Slither , written and directed by James Gunn , continues the blood fad with them slimy creatures combined with zombies who walk the earth . Don't bother figuring out the whys and the hows , and forget about the plot , which has holes punched right through by the introductory meteorite . Just sit back and enjoy whatever thrills and spills this movie throws at you . It's great mindless fun as you see slimy red worms forcing their way into their prey's ( read : humans ) mouths , in order to take over control , kinda like Invasion of Body Snatchers . During this state , the humans will walk , talk , act like generic zombies , minus the strength , but the lust for human MEAT still remains . Oh , did I mention it was a bit phallic looking , the way the worms force their entry into the human mouth ? M18 it screams . As always , with horror movies like these , the chicks score in the looks department , and little else . Serenity / Firefly's Captain Mal lends some die-hard action chops as Bill , cop extraordinaire , probably picking up lessons from John McClane in staying alive despite unsurmountable odds . Again there are plenty of throwaway characters , as they serve only the sole purpose of increasing the bodycounts . The main villain in the movie is this meteorite carrying some space alien which is making its rounds cannibalizing planet inhabitants . So Earth is next on the radar , and it found its host in unsuspecting Grant ( Michael Rooker ) , whose young wife Starla ( Elizabeth Banks , Spiderman's Betty Brant ) is lusted after by Bill . Starla turns out to be one faithful spouse , and it is exactly those matrimonial vows that Grant takes a mickey of when things go horribly wrong . Characterization take a backseat here , as the target audience is only interested in who's gonna be the next victim of a spectacular death sequence . It took a while for the set up though , so be prepared to be a little bored by the first act . The special effects team did a tremendous job in bringing the gooey slithery slimeball worms to life , and empowering the zombies with green icky spit . Then again , dumb newbie zombies don't know how to fully harness their powers . There are many of the usual splice-and-dice scenes with innards pouring out , but somehow they still provided me with the usual kicks . Same goes for the close quarter combats , and those up close gunfire . All in all , it's quite enjoyable , from a warped point of view . It's part Aliens , part Living Dead , part Anaconda , part everything that moves on its belly . Stay tuned until after the ending credits for one forgettable sequence .
515104	317399	420555	7.0	A Nutshell Review : How Much Do You Love Me ?	How Much Do You Love Me ? examines that emotion called Love , or what it's perceived to be . Will you make pretend and move in with someone ? Are you loving someone because of his riches ? Or because of his huge wiener or her hot body ? Is it purely lust or love ? And how in the world do fugly people snag all the hot chicks too ? Between money and love , which would you choose ( and taking too long to decide doesn't earn you brownie points ) ? Like Pretty Woman , only with less candy fluff , how can someone fall in love with a whore ? ( Ok , so it might sound politically incorrect , but that's how the movie plays it out ) A regular joe , Francois , falls for a prostitute at a bar . Played by Monica Belluci , Daniela is the obsession of Francois , as he engages her services for 100 , 000 Euros to live with him for a month ( she charges 150 Euros a night , so work out the math ) until he runs out of cash . A balding man who just won the lottery of 4 million Euros and some , he sure knows how to pick up and select his women . Soon after , Francois becomes the envy of everyone ( so is Vincent Cassell , but I digress ) , as friends like his personal doctor advises him to go easy on his escapades because of his weak heart . But in this black comedy , unfortunate events befall upon those who try to keep the couple apart . It's a tad interesting too as the movie plays out the fantasies of these nay - sayers , as they too lust after Daniela in secret . There's a twist to all the madness , and the final revelation will make you go " ahh ! " as the scheme is unveiled to a whacked out near ending sequence ( do I love that sexy dance move ) . However , as do most art movies go , the ending leaves much to be interpreted in many ways . The visuals are beautiful to look at , and no , I'm not just talking about Bellucci here , although I'd rather watch her in action than the other old babe Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct 2 . Blended with a lot of jazz , it has a bluesy feel to it all , punctuating melancholic mood throughout as felt by the characters . And it's the three key characters who keep the storyline interesting . A regular bloke buying his way to a woman's heart . A woman who whores because she wants to ( and probably satisfying her insatiable appetite for sex ) , and her gangster husband Charly ( Gerard Depardieu ) who allows her to do what she wants to , as his interpretation of love is the clich√©d " if you love her set her free . If she returns she's yours " belief . In the end , love is also about respect , and that's the lesson Charly needed to learn . It's plenty talk about love , sex and even orgasms , and the highlight is probably the three way negotiation on the table as Francois and Charly haggle the price over Daniela . Can love be attached with a price ? How much is it worth ? The plenty of ah-peks in the audience will probably have an answer to this question , and no doubt , ensure this movie's longevity in local screens .
514757	317399	1182972	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Bachna Ae Hasseno	Ranbir Kapoor in his debut leading man role as Ranbir in Saawariya , didn't have the luck to snag the lady of his dreams , maybe because he was kind of a cad too , where karma had a part to return and haunt him . In his second feature film here , his Raj Sharma is again a cad , and credits himself being a " lady killer " , able to woo any woman when he turns on his charms . We journey with him as he learns the true meaning of romance and love , and the first half of the movie before the intermission , gives the audience three situations over the course of 11 years where he toys with the emotions of different girls , broadly the sweet , sexy and sassy type , until of course , Karma catches up with him again for that all important lesson . Girl 1 : Sweet . 1996 . Switzerland . In what would seem like a Before Sunrise storyline , Raj meets Mahi ( Minissha Lamba ) on board a Euro-train , and engineers his way to be able to spend time alone with his mark , on the pretext of sending her to Zurich to reunite with her family for their trip back to India . This episode sets the stage for Raj as the manipulative casanova , while Mahi is a very girly girl who harbours dreams of that perfect man , the perfect romantic encounter , and that perfect romance coming out just like her favourite movie . Only to discover that her puppy love , with sweet nothings and dedicated poems , resulted to naught when Raj's game is exposed . Broken Heart 1 . Girl 2 : Sexy . 2002 . Mumbai . Raj seemed to have moved on to another target , though it may seem from the onset he's already been domesticated by Radhika ( Bipasha Basu from Dhoom 2 ) , a hot model and aspiring actress who's his neighbour and they're living in together . Raj would have thought that a woman like her , stereotyped of course , would be easy and loose , living the fast life , and wouldn't want to be tied down to marriage because it will hamper her career . So when an opportunity to work in Sydney comes knocking and presents itself as a perfect moment to ditch her , to his surprise Radhika contemplates marriage , which he tries wholeheartedly to avoid . She's willing to sacrifice her career for him , but suffers the unthinkable in being left at the altar . Broken Heart 2 . Girl 3 : Sassy . 2007 . Sydney . It's actually quite a no-brainer to cast Deepika Padukone here given that she too , like Ranbir Kapoor , had 1 feature film under her belt , and are relatively successful newcomers to the industry ( her first effort was in Om Shanti Om , and more recently , Chandni Chowk to China ) . And ( ok Gossipy news ahead ) this film actually was the catalyst for their much touted romance ( and you can see the dynamics at work with some of the behind the scenes and interviews included in the 2nd disc ) . Anyway her role here as Gayatri , a business school student who works her way through school as a supermarket check out girl and a taxi driver , impresses Raj a lot , enough to romance her in Venice , and give up his gallivanting ways . Only of course for him to have met his match , and got spurned on his marriage proposal . She's a modern girl wanting to live life on her own terms , so being someone else's wife has never featured in her plans . What goes around finally comes around . Broken Heart 3 . Raj's . While the first half of the movie before the intermission was pretty plain sailing romantic stuff , the second half proved to be more powerful , because the protagonist finally has his eyes opened by his new experience , and realized he's been quite a bastard . So off he goes to make amends with the girls whose hearts he had broken , and mind you , in both real and reel life , this is never easy . Especially when you have to go back and face the women who had one point in time truly love you , and your actions had single handedly destroyed their belief in romance , and change or scar them for life . We get a lot more jet-setting as well , all worked into the plot , such as the visits to Amritsar , Capri and Rome , as we follow Raj on his mission impossible to seek redemption and forgiveness from a housewife with a protective husband , and another who's now a renowned model with success to her head . I had enjoyed this section more because trying his best to be honest now , Raj has to strip his ego and really crack his head to device his forgiveness plan . Also , we get to see the different demeanours that both Bipasha Basu and Minissha Lamba had to tackle given their characters ' failed romance with Raj , which had changed them either for the better , or worse . The songs here proved to be catchy and fitting to each of the sweet , sexy and sassy persona that the girls bring to the table , and the beautiful locales they were shot in again were draws . Other than the very first musical number Bachna Ae Haseeno which opens the film , you don't get to see everybody on the same scene together , as each storyline took place under mutually exclusive terms , in timeline as well as locations . If there's something to take away from the film , then it's the lesson that Raj learns , with the past being over and there's no longer control over it , but we can rectify things for the future if we take action in the present . Call me a sentimental fool , but somehow this works on me .
514761	317399	451079	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Horton Hears a Who !	I've got to make a mental note that movies that have trailers playing in the cinemas for the longest time , do not a boring movie make , even if the first half of the movie plays like the extended version of the trailer , telling us things we already know , spelling out the premise all over again . Jim Carrey and Steve Carell unite on the big screen again after their short pairing up in Bruce Almighty , although this time they're animated as animals / creatures from Dr Seuss ' fictional world . Jim Carrey voices Horton , an elephant who in moments where you least expect , spew lines of poetry as dialogue . We're introduced to his character from the onset , though his backstory isn't really fleshed out , except that there are those ( like the Kangaroo ) who hates all for what he stands for . And simply put , Horton exudes all qualities typical of what elephants are made out to be - excellent memory , frightened about the unknown , and trustworthiness . These qualities are put to the test when he chances upon a speck on a clover . That speck turns out to be home for an ecosystem populated by Whos , minute creatures who seem to live very mundane , repetitive lives in their very own little paradise . Things start to go awry , especially with severe environmental changes , and despite the Mayor of Whoville ( Carell ) warning of the great unknown out there , like all predictors of impending doom , get ridiculed by the population . So begins the friendship between HOrton , trying to protect the world of his new found friend by relocating the speck to safe haven , and the Mayor , who must warn his disbelieving population about more dangers to come . For a while it drags on , with childish banter between the two lead characters , and the plot by Horton haters to bring him down by destroying his toy of the moment , not acknowledging his mantra that a person's a person , no matter how small . They want proof , and they're not getting any , since the Whos are also laughing at the fact that there are bigger creatures out there , outside the realms of their known atmosphere . It's as if one's trying to convince a large group of atheist that there is a supreme being up there and he's up there watching our every move ( ok , so Horton doesn't actually get to see them , but you get my drift ) . But the struggling with existentialism , is what made Horton Hears a Who shine brightly , and made the ticket worthwhile . A pity we have to really wait out for it , but at least these tense moments came , better late than never , that really brought out enough drama and excitement that I never saw coming my way . Otherwise , the animation's pretty standard fare in 2D , and chock full of supporting characters ( voiced by Seth Rogen , Carol Burnett , Dan Fogler , Isla Fisher , Amy Poehler and Jaime Pressly et al ) just to ramp up the cute factor , without giving them much to do anyway , though I must admit the gorillas almost always crack me up ( you should see what they can do with their bananas ! ) Smart to debut this during the school holidays this week to catch hold of school going kids . Oh , and get yourself into the hall early as you'll get to see Ice Age's Scrat up to his antics to promote Ice Age 3 , due on in Summer 2009 ( yes , 2009 ! )
515102	317399	340147	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Happily , Even After	Happily . Even After is a tale directed by Singapore born director Unsu Lee , a neat little sibling drama , with a surreal fairy tale inject into the narrative . It's pretty amazing I suppose for any Singaporean director to have had his hands at making a movie in the USofA , and one which stars Jason Behr , of Roswell the television series fame too . With their parents ' unfortunate demise , siblings Elizabeth ( Fay Masterson ) and Jake ( Behr ) are left to fend for themselves . Taking upon herself to look after her brother , she falls for an all too familiar role of being the naggy , overly concerned big sister role , a relatively successful career woman , with quite a pathetic love life . Jake , on the other hand , is a character who seemed to have everything going his way as a kid , until he decided to clam up and shut himself to the outside world - the quintessential under-achieving slacker , the disdained anti - social with a mission to bust his liver with alcohol . However , everything changes ( as always ) when Katie ( Marina Black ) enters their lives . Knowing Elizabeth through a roof top encounter , having Katie offer her services as a nanny - fairy-godmother of sorts , to look after Jake and get his life back on track , it seems like it's one of many films with similar plots , of having a girl teaching a guy how to live life . Katie and Jake don't hit it off from the start , given their bad encounter with each other at a laundromat at the start of the movie , but it falls into predictability as our guy falls in love with the girl , sending Jason Behr's groupie fans amongst the audience into ecstasy . Predictability though , is not on the menu , so some twists are expected towards the end . It might be contrived to some , in the vein that it had to go down the course it was chosen , to be different . But it is indeed this difference that makes this movie truly unique , and having it open ended , allows for various interpretations of what could be , or could have been . Set in San Francisco , the movie has superb music done by Kid Galahad , which adds an excellent layer accompanying the pleasing visuals . The cast , including those in supporting roles , did an adequate job in fleshing out their characters , and allows you to easily identify the struggles that each of them go through , to overcome doubt , gain confidence , and more importantly , to live life .
514687	317399	478087	7.0	A Nutshell Review : 21	While Las Vegas is Sin City personified , having been there in person actually stripped away much of the glitz and glamour that comes courtesy of various movies and television series . Maybe because I'm not a high roller ( or even a simple punter to begin with ) that I don't get to enjoy the sexiness that comes with attention lavished at their well-known , well-paying customers . But in any case , the mathematics of it is that the house always win , and it is not a zero sum game , always in favour of the house . A bus driver in Vagas once told me that it's simple logic - look at the hotel above the casino . The larger it is , the higher the overheads , and guess where their revenue is coming from ? You guessed it . Based on a true story about a group of MIT students who utilized their smarts from what the textbook never taught them , you can trust Hollywood to sex it all up , especially with a professor in the mould of Kevin Spacey , and teammates who look like they jumped right out of glamour magazines . Being naturally smart and the cream of the crop , they get seduced by Spacey's Professor Micky Rosa , who rationalizes that they aren't cheating , but beating the system on their own numbers game through card counting . That means back to basics probability and statistics , together with some tools of the trade such as disguises , fake IDs and a whole elaborate rouse of communication using secret words and sign language . And here's the flaw of the movie , perhaps to dumb it down for an audience because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that signs and codewords should change each time you hit a different casino so that you won't be caught repeating the same trick over and over again to the eyes in the skies , which provided a separate sub plot dealing with the threat of security personnel being outsourced and downsized by technology , and therein making old school folks like Laurence Fishburne's Cole Williams obsolete . Jim Sturgess is slowly getting his profile raised , last seen in these parts with Across the Universe . Here , his Ben Campbell is the A student who's just like every other A student trying their best to get to Harvard Medical School , and that sole scholarship up for grabs will be awarded to just one fella with the most impressive resume . Knowing that his chance is slim , he has to figure out how to cough up US$300K just to get himself into his dream institution , so as the tale would have it , that rationale and figure required became his excuse to take up gambling as a means to his end . Joined by fellow students Jill ( Kate Bosworth ) , Choi ( Aaron Yoo ) , Kianna ( Liza Lapira ) and Jimmy ( Jacob Pitts ) under Prof Mickey's tutelage , they hone their mathematical and social engineering skills in an expected montage , before hitting the gaming floors of Vegas to rake in the dough . And in between they will find time for romance , and constantly battle the urge of easy money , emotions running high , and all the trappings from the lifestyles of the rich . However , don't expect a lot from the supporting characters , as Kate just got to preen around looking like a pretty vase , while the token Asians get caricature roles , like a kleptomaniac . While Spacey is his usual chilling self and Sturgess managed the pretty boy charismatic presence well , 21 still found it necessary to explain everything , from detailing every bit of plot development including laying out all necessary twists and turns out on the table neatly , and how the mathematical rouse actually worked . However , don't expect to pick up a tip or two from the movie , because it actually requires a step one for you to be a mathematical genius for mental gymnastics to be performed at the top of your head . Otherwise , you can just forget it , and just pick up a lottery ticket and hope for the best . But what I enjoyed from the movie , is all the wink-winks with regards to the corruption that permeates through the education system , be it getting grades from your tutors , or admissions requiring exorbitant amounts of cash . Granted that the tuition fees are not cheap because of rising salaries and cost of maintaining the school , sometimes these can be contributed in nice ways which are quite above the board , in cases of having to scratch your back and having you scratch mine back . Still , 21 made for an enjoyable heist / gambling type of movie , sans those comedic ones which HK used to put out continuously at one point in time . It has a decent , Hollywood-hyped up story to tell , with the usual message that crime does not pay , and to use your smarts wisely in the right direction .
515503	317399	492835	7.0	A Nutshell Review : King and the Clown	King and the Clown was South Korea's best selling film of 2005 , having sold more than 12 million tickets over a span of 7 weeks . But after watching it , it's difficult to fathom the craze , nor about the New York Times hype that it " may be the equivalent of ' Brokeback Mountain ' " . Not that it is a bad movie , it is actually entertaining and tells an intriguing story in the courts of the Korean emperor . Perhaps anything to do with the gay theme will suffer inevitably comparisons to Lee Ang's acclaimed Brokeback Mountain . But somehow , the way this film developed , I saw it in a different light - a story between two male best friends , even though one of them might look and behave more effeminately than even some girls do . Instead of jumping to the straight conclusion that both the protagonists are gay , why can't it be a platonic relationship , and that the more effeminate one had chosen what he had to do , i . e . sell backside , because being poor minstrels , they cannot afford to put food on the table ? Literally capitalizing on his looks , to bring back the dough . Sure his friend might not like the idea , and it could be interpreted as either being jealous ( as a lover ) , or disapproving ( as a friend ) . Then again , because of culture , this movie might have decided to be more subtle about the theme . Ambiguous to say the least , but it makes for interesting debate if you watch this with a friend . Two friends , Jang-seng ( Kam Woo-sung ) and Gong-gil ( Lee Joon-ki ) , are impoverished street performers who dream of having their entertaining performances reap rewards they should be getting . They come up with a wildly popular and bawdy performance poking fun at the emperor and his consort , and it's not long before they get arrested , only to have Jang-seng proposition a dare , that if the King doesn't laugh at their skit , they can be put to death . As fate would have it , their jittery performance brought on a favourable response from the tyrannical King ( Jung Jin-young ) . Having now become official court jesters , their subsequent plays , whose content they obtain from coffee-shop talk of those days , about the royal family and other court scandals , serve as suggestive fuel for the King to break free from his constrictive shackles , and take some serious action according to his whims . But dictator attitudes aside , he casts a lustful eye at Gong-gil , and turns almost childlike when in his presence , in private . The most powerful man in the kingdom , reduced to a vulnerable kid in the presence of a lowly minstrel . What ensues is an interesting look at the relationship dynamics amongst the three men , and with the people around them . Set during the Chosun Dynasty , King and the Clown has some of the most gorgeous sets bringing to life an era long gone , and beautiful costumes that drown the movie in a myriad of colours . The songs are also fairly pleasing to the ears , and the skits , I believe , are likely to be many times more enjoyable if you understand Korean , instead of having to rely on subtitles . The movie also makes discreet jibes at those in power , and their ability , or inability , to accept satires about themselves . It is always easy for men in power to dismiss harshly the satires and their creators , but it takes a lot more to be able to look past the comic and understand the issues made fun of . There are brief scenes at courtroom politicking and on corruption , but these scenes are too short to leave any lasting impression or distract the audience . The cast is a delight to watch as they carry their roles with aplomb . The chemistry between the 3 main leads was almost perfect , especially Jung Jin-young as the temperamental King - childish at times , serious at others , and the androgynous looking Lee Joon-ki truly owned the role of Gong-gil , that even as a guy , I thought he was beautiful to look at ( ahem ) . All in all , King and the Clown is a story of friendship , how good friends fend for each other , how , despite shortcomings and misunderstandings , the best medicine is always laughter , and it's the strength of the bonds between men that can ultimately stand up against fear and overcome any adversary . If only the opening didn't spoil the entire movie .
514478	317399	301777	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Robot Stories	Robot Stories is an anthology of 4 distinct segments which premiered in the Singapore Fantastic Film Festival this evening , with a common theme of advanced technology or robots taking centerstage . My Robot Baby In the future where career minded couples have no time to conceive and turn to adoption , they will have to go through a " baby trial " period , whereby they will be tasked to take care of a baby-like Tamaguchi robot , which looks similar and beeps just like Star Wars ' Artoo-Deetoo , sans legs . The robot records how it is treated by the couple , and without proper care , feeding and cleaning , once the evaluation period is up , the couple will be deemed unsuitable to adopt a human child . So when career gets in the way of childcare , desperate times calls for desperate measures . While a robot can be hacked and reprogrammed , the same cannot be done for a human child , and critical sacrifices has got to be made . It makes you think if what had been done to outsmart the system is ethical , and reflect upon a statement made by one of the characters early in the film on " never fall in love , never get married , and never have kids " if these sacrifices cannot be made . The Robot Fixer A man is lying comatose on a hospital bed , while a mother clings onto childhood memories of her time with her kid . While waiting for her child to wake up from his coma , she inevitably goes through his stuff , with most of her memories being linked with his robotic toys . While she scours all around town to re-assemble the broken and lost pieces ( in the hope that it will jog his brain waves when she speaks and presents them to him ) , it parallels her determination and never-say-die spirit that her son will one day be able to be with her again . My guess is any son or mother in the audience , will be able to identify with the characters . As a son , I did , and I know that my mom will go through all lengths to wake me up from that deep sleep , with similar methods and determination . A mother's love is always strong . Machine Love Director Greg Pak stars as the protagonist in this segment , a ( probably subtle approval to Apple ) model G9 iPerson , who's able to self-deliver himself to the company he is bought for . This segment perhaps dreams of what the future may hold for Artificial Intelligence - that of never-tiring workers who can work at their desks all day without the need for breaks , always responding eagerly to " you got work " calls and striving to accomplish all assigned tasks in the fastest possible speed . And with AI , this segment inevitably explores the " what ifs " that these lifeforms could have or developed in terms of emotions , and love , as they learn through interactions with humans . Being the perfect worker , it also brings forth fear into humans on things that we don't understand , and the usual name calling / chiding happens . Abuse also follows with female versions of the iPerson , with lecherous males openly fondling and commenting on why the racks ain't being bigger . I shan't finish this segment for you , except to comment that these robots sure know the right buttons to push ! Clay This is , in my opinion , the weakest of the four stories , but the one which has the most potential , and features the most human of emotions , that of love , longing and the anticipation of death . It is an era where the human brain can be mapped onto a computer , so that man can finally beat death , and while the physical person wastes away , the consciousness will forever be alive in an electronic form . The protagonist , however , refuses to use this technology , being a clay-artist , he loathes the thought of designing his craft without feeling or emotions . However , he uses technology to interact with his dead ( ? ) wife , and with the proper plug in , could also get intimate with her . There is nothing new with this technology feature as it was also shown on screen in Tom Cruise's Minority Report . But interwoven into the narrative is a strong sense of his wanting to be back in the arms of his wife again . Do stay for the end credits . There is a slide at the end which states that production started on September 10th 2001 , and the crew lost one of their own in the WTC attacks . Also after the end credits , one of the dancing robots ( featured in the opening credits ) will appear with a message on New York . For those who wish to catch this film , you can do so on Monday where the evening show will be screened at GV Marina .
515238	317399	410297	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Lake House	I haven't watched Il Mare , the Korean original starring Jeon Ji-hyun , in which this Hollywood remake is based upon . I refuse to watch the original on VCD , and had no luck in tracking down a DVD copy . I guess it's just a matter of time before I order it online , some box-set no less . In any case , what probably excited audiences to the remake , is the pairing of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock , one which has been long overdue since their very first pairing which sizzled with chemistry , and that being on an action movie no less - Speed . While both had moved on to star in various romances with other counterparts such as Charlize Theron , Cameron Diaz , Bill Pullman , Ben Affleck and Harry Connick Jr . , the wait is over as they now reunite on screen in The Lake House . But throughout the 100 minutes movie , they share not more than 15 minutes of screen time together , and those are precious minutes which will have the audience inevitably rooting for something to happen . Especially so with the time-travel note-in-the-letterbox plot device where comedic , smart alecky words slowly turn into mushy terms of endearment . Reeves and Bullock , considerably aged from their first outing together , are perfectly cast as the unlikely lovers separated by time . However , to fit into the typical Hollywood finale , there's a huge plot loophole in the time travelling piece , which I find a pity , then again , it's probably an ending that most people would expect , and crave for ? As the story progressed , there were no issues with time travelling being in the way of the narrative . Keanu's Alex is an architect in the year 2004 , and Sandra's Kate is a doctor in the year 2006 . They are occupants of a house on a lake in Chicago , and slowly find that through a strange twist of Fate , they are communicating with each other through an old fashioned mailbox . And because one person is ahead of the other in time , Alex is able to see and come to know the Kate of year 2004 , except that at that point in time , she doesn't know him yet . It's one of the usual story techniques used to work an emotional reaction from an audience , and here , it's executed perfectly too , as they work towards a reunion meeting in the year 2006 , then 2008 . Good things , ought to wait , no ? Eagle eyed viewers though , will spot a key plot revelation early in the movie , and will be able to unravel the entire plot thereafter . However this probably wouldn't mar the enjoyment of the film , as the focus will be on how the story gets told , and admittedly , that's the draw which turned out fine , until the end where the film decides to go heck with the time travel crutch it has to rely on . Modern day stuff and devices are not included , like email and cameras , as modes of communication between the lovers , which will obviously remove a lot of romanticism from the movie , and shorten the duration too . To fill time in what could essentially be a short movie , and to vary the kind of scenes instead of the usual voice-over communications and reading of letters , there is a subplot involving Alex's dad ( played by veteran Christopher Plummer ) . The Lake House , in my opinion , is a reasonably wonderful romance movie to take a date too . It's full of clich√©s , warm moments , and enough tension built up towards the end to satisfy , and with that plot loophole , provide enough material for you and your date to discuss it over .
514875	317399	492956	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Game Plan	American football team Boston Rebels ' star quarterback Joe Kingman ( The Rock ) has only two loves in his life - Football and Elvis Presley . Like all successful sports superstars at the top of their game , he's living the good life , with his swanky penthouse apartment fitted with the latest luxuries , a sportster that screams " Mo Jo ( e ) " , and endless parties with beautiful women . But alas one fine day he finds little Peyton Kelly ( Madison Pettis ) at his doorstep , claiming to be his daughter , and thus putting the brakes in his fast life . It's convenient to start weaving woeful family drama and comedy about the complete opposites being struck by Fate to live under the same roof . As the trailers would have suggested , everything comes off quite predictably , and at times you feel that such scenes where the young girl tosses Kingman's life upside down , to be a little too contrived , and mostly having fall flat at its attempts to be funny . When funny doesn't work , it switches gears to cute . However , The Game Plan possesses a certain charm , helped in loads without a doubt by the charisma of Dwayne The Rock Johnson . WWE entertainers perform their craft perfectly in the wrestling ring , but extremely few have made the transition to the big screen almost seamlessly . Dwayne Johnson happens to be one of the lucky few , with his megawatt smile and very personable demeanour , bringing him across as the big buddy you would like to hang out with . And while we know he can do action - The Scorpion King , Rundown , Walking Tall and Doom , he has shown a range of his ability through dramas like Gridiron Gang , and comedy , with his extremely hilarious turn in Be Cool . In The Game Plan , he rolls all those into one without breaking a sweat , and this movie is almost single-handedly saved from the doldrums by resting itself on his broad muscular shoulders . Gridiron Gang had American Football elements in it , though The Rock now crosses from being the coach to the star player . He's the action sports hero with trademark moves ( every respectable star would have one of those ) , the arrogant himbo who let success go into his head , and through the movie , we see a transformation to sensitive dad . What you don't see The Rock do , is best kept under wraps as probably THE BEST SCENE in this movie , which you have to watch to bear witness . Talk about extreme flexibility ! Some credit of course has to go to his co-stars in making the movie more palatable to a wider audience outside the fan base , though most of them , like Kyra Sedgwick as the bimbo , and Roselyn Sanchez as the hot latino instructor , are more caricatures without much personality injected , as expected . Madison Pettis shines in her role as the precocious kid , but sometimes she pouts too much and comes across more irritating than cute , though still managing to hold her own opposite Johnson . There are some heartwarming scenes between her and The Rock , and you'll probably be trying to hold back that teardrop . This is still a star vehicle for Dwayne Johnson , and I hope that he will not ditch his action roles for drama or comedy , given a distinct lack of action movie stars that I humbly think he can fill . We all know how Arnie fared when he dabbled with comedy before going back to his Terminator roots , or Vin Diesel for that matter when he traded stunts for the milk bottle in The Pacifier . Filled with plenty of Elvis songs ( director Andy Fickman is reportedly a fan ) that you can hear Johnson serenade with , there are enjoyable moments in The Game Plan , and its predictable Zacherie sweet messages on family , determination and the likes , will no doubt make this movie achieve a decent box office success here . As a fan , I can't wait for his debut in Get Smart , and crossing my fingers he'll be casted in the much rumored production of Shazam ! as The Big Red Cheese !
515071	317399	456912	7.0	A Nutshell Review : A Bittersweet Life	This is a revenge movie , pure and simple . When it comes to this genre , the protagonist usually has some injustice ( loosely used here ) done unto him , and therefore unleashes hell upon those who incurred his wrath , who of course , failed to finish him off in the first place . Sun-woo ( Lee Byung-hun ) is a hotel manager . Or so he seems . On the surface , he's calm , cool and collected . But step out of line , he brings upon his fury without remorse , and without sympathy . His cockiness earns him no admirers , but he gives his utmost loyalty towards his boss , President Kang . He leads a lonely existence without friends , and in his latest mission , strikes a forbidden friendship with his prey that led to his ostracizing from the clan he belongs to . Relying on his personal judgement , in contradiction with his boss's , he consciously interpreted his mission ambiguously , and this led to his downfall . In the mob , as a servant , you do not think , but carry out orders like a faithful dog . Such is his life for seven years , until now . As with revenge films , those who go against you must die , and you soon find yourself up against impossible odds , and with incredible luck . At times the movie stretches its realism to the limit , but for the purpose of good violent fun . The violence is gratuitous - shootings up close , bleeding by the buckets , hand-breaking , fist-fighting , at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson . But thumbs up for the action pieces , which were well choreographed , especially the escape fight scene ( you must learn , never to give a few minutes to a hit-man ) , and the climatic shoot out finale . Poetry in motion some might add , at times shot like John Woo's slow-motion style with classical music in the background . Various bad characters are up for our anti-hero's dispatch , and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible . On the other end of the spectrum , this film also had incredible amounts of silence and non-action , which punctuated between the action sequences well . Sort of like a breather - the calm before the next storm . The relationship element between Sun-woo and Hee-soo ( Shin Min-a ) however was never fully explored . It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman , but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue , this was never brought across in a clear manner , and left open to interpretation . Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters . Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit . Nonetheless , as a revenge movie , this film delivered . But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could , and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast , stylish action and of course , bloody violence .
514726	317399	329774	7.0	A Nutshell Review : xXx2	Watching this film is like being with your current beau and yet constantly reminded of your ex . We all know that Xander Cage ( Vin Diesel ) is not the xXx in this show , and he's being replaced by Darius Stone ( Ice Cube ) . Heck , I think the producers make the mistake of killing Xander Cage - mentioned in the movie as being killed in action in Bora Bora , Afghanistan , because in my opinion his character makes an excellent action hero . That's reminiscence number one - being reminded of what could have been if the charismatic Vin Diesel continued for this film . Throughout the film , we see some similarities with Xanda or scenes from the original xXx . Like a scene in a diner with Gibbons ( good IL mo-fo Samuel L Jackson , who's given more screen time this time around ) , a sea-craft ride down a river , wisecracks on the moniker xXx ( " I sound like a porn star " ) , the reluctance of being drawn into the game of cloak and daggers , and ( mis ) quoting one of my favourite lines in the original - " The things I would do for my country " ! But while Xander Cage's an extreme sports person , Darius Stone is more " in your face " , given his military background in covert ops , with a penchant for some fries and a shake . The original film's delivery is more subtle , more elegant , while this one's more direct and in a way , nothing different from another action flick . The action is standard Hollywood-blow-em-up fest , right from the beginning and never lets up throughout the film . Everything's bigger ( M1 Abrams Tank , Aircraft Carrier , Choppers ) , noisier ( guns and explosions everywhere ) and faster ( modified cars and humongous wheels ) . No doubt the movie looks good given that the action pieces looks expensive , and effects well done by Industrial Light and Magic . Did I mention the girls ? We get 2 in this one , but their roles are merely decorative , unlike Asia Argento's meatier and eye - " candier " chick role in xXx1 . And the villains are your good old one-dimensional foes who tend to lapse into monologues , and I feel that Willem Dafoe is a bit underutilized . My only gripe with this film is that xXx has to rely on his boyz n the hood - it's actually quite hilarious to see street gangs take on military might , " carjacking " a tank and actually winning . Not too credible , but hey , it's only a movie . Did you know this film is called " xXx : State of the Union " in the US ( referring to the President's State of the Union Address , which forms the finale ) , but I guess for those outside who don't care less about US politics , we're pretty OK with the dumbed-down title of " xXx2 : The Next Level " - makes it sound like some arcade game . So buckle up and enjoy the ride , and if this is proved as popular as the original , we might see xXx3 ( given the setting up of a sequel at the end ) , and the possibility of seeing a new face as the new xXx . Now if the producers just stop killing them , I'd think it's pretty cool to see a couple of xXxs teaming up . Ooh . . . the potential for more mayhem !

515560	317399	490166	7.0	A Nutshell Review : London to Brighton	There were some in the audience who couldn't believe that a film like Amos Gitai's Promised Land could be made , given its almost documentary like feel to an aged old problem of human trafficking for prostitution . I suppose those who feel that way would probably not take to London to Brighton , which like films such as Lilya-4-eva take an angle of child prostitution , and spun a different narrative out of it . Here , it's actually out of desperation - in fact almost all the characters here reek of it , in exploiting children on the streets and enticing them with significant sums of money in order to satisfy the whims of some rich clients . The film takes on a non-linear narrative in having its tale told , which leaves you pretty much engaged in wanting to find out just why two women are on the flight as per its title , leaving behind the city of London in double quick time , where we are introduced at 3 : 07am to Joanne ( Georgia Groome ) in thick makeup , being hidden in a stank toilet cubicle by an older lady of the streets , Kelly ( Lorraine Stanley ) , suffering from one badly bruised eye . I suppose a modest production budget made this film look like a typical gritty English crime thriller , with the hand held camera bringing the audience into the thick of the action , either slowly drawing some sympathies from the lead female characters because of the lack of options made available to them , including being on the run , or presenting a sense of clear and present danger up close , especially when pimps Derek ( Johnny Harris ) and Chum ( Nathan Constance ) become inevitably close in catching up with the duo for an event they committed , kept closely under wraps . The relationship between Kelly and Joanne remain one of the highlights of the film , two women who have nobody else to turn to , trying to determine what their next course of action might be at every turn . We see how Kelly takes it upon herself as the surrogate guardian of Joanne , but I suppose only because of the immense guilt that she brought to the table , for having again out of desperation , introduce a young girl into her dark underworld . Those who have watched Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging would see how Georgia Groome makes an about turn from privileged child , to one roaming the streets . The other highlight which I had enjoyed was how thugs have the capability of systematically breaking down one's defenses , in balancing threats and carrots so as to gain some level of trust and obedience . Johnny Harris plays his role well as the pimp who constantly looks out for himself , of bowing to authority and pressure , while Nathan Constance as his chum actually had a lot more characterization going on for him instead . A pity though that it wasn't explored further , and had to be ended as it did in the film . London to Brighton has a sense of danger permeating throughout , in a sort of hunter versus prey kind of film , that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it builds up to its last act , in a story succinctly told in under 80 minutes .
514970	317399	263101	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Bangkok Dangerous	I picked up this DVD because I've been to Bangkok couple of times , and wanted to see how the filmmakers Oxide and Danny Pang manage to capture the more sleazy side of the city , and combine it with gangster noir to come up with Bangkok Dangerous . I've heard about the movie , and was surprised that our National Library actually had this DVD in its collection . Bangkok Dangerous tells the story of a deaf mute assassin Kong ( Pawalit Mongkolpisit ) . His is a life of mission after mission , a cold and professional , though small time , killer . Growing up being bullied because of his disability , he finds work at a gun range as a cleaner , until he chances upon Joe ( Pisek Intrakanchit ) and his girlfriend Aom ( Patharawarin Timkul ) . Kong learns his skills from Joe ( in an excellent montage ) , and together , form a tag-team partnership . During the course of work , Kong chances upon the beautiful Fon ( Premsinee Ratanasopha ) who works at a drugstore , and in between missions , he romances Fon , who doesn't shun him in spite of being a deaf mute . The killer has finally known what it is to develop feelings and to love . However , if you live by the gun , chances are there will be those who are after you . Things change for the worse when Aom offends one of the gang's ranked member , and gets raped . Joe goes for revenge , but ultimately gets literally betrayed by the hand that feeds . Kong has to decide - to finish what had started and avenge his friends , or to try and begin life anew with the woman he loves , even after she has started to avoid him , knowing what he does for a living . In a cosmopolitan city like Bangkok , this film manages to capture a kaleidoscope of colours , mood , and use various camera angles to its advantage . It contrasts the shady underworld and strip bars , and its pulsating music , with the silent , kind world of love that Kong for the first time experiences when he's with Fon . It's a story of finding one's own morality when living in the midst of violence and sleaze , and the seeking of redemption from a life of sin .

515548	317399	1068680	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Yes Man	It's been a while since Jim Carrey hit the screens , going back to his comedic roots after the rather lacklustre dramatic turn in the thriller The Number 23 . But it's a somewhat muted Carrey we get , as gone out the window are the over the top antics and rubbery face , and in comes a fine balance between getting the laughs , as well as having some dramatic flair in crafting a believable working class character who is jaded with work and life in general , opting instead to coast through life almost like a recluse . And when a friend told me that this character was somewhat familiar , I understand his point . I suppose most of us could probably identify with the very routine lives that we're leading , juggling work and whatever effort we can muster to have a semblance of balance , either with family , friends , or spending some quality time investing in oneself . But this means regressing into the tried , tested and safe , losing that spark that comes with the randomness of living , and the gaining of experience that would have been gained . In fact , it brought back some memories that I was once a Yes Man myself , and I won't deny that somewhere along the way I've taken a detour , though it was a conscious decision at that . Jim Carrey plays Carl Allen , a junior loans officer at a bank who spends his time at work , and his personal life , in saying no to everyone and to opportunities , ignoring calls and well meaning efforts from friends to bring him out of his shell . But a life changing seminar ( I've been to something similar , even though it was just a preview ) with pop music , enthusiastic energizer-bunny type attendees , and an enigmatic speaker , would convince him to take the plunge into make a covenant to say yes to every opportunity that comes by . Not that he has any choice since the self-help guru is played by Terence Stamp , and nobody has the audacity to say no to General Zod . ( Curiously , Terence Stamp has been in plenty of supporting roles of late ) . So begins a series of situational comedies , most of which would already have been captured in the trailer . Carl begins to live life as he wanted to , taking lessons , meeting people , and what I found to be most appealing , would be to convert from a person of negative thoughts , to a positive thinking fellow . His new attitude opens doors , and almost instantly he reaps the benefits of this new found approach , the best of course is the encounter with hot chick Allison ( Zooey Deschanel ) . Besides the philosophy behind the movie , Yes Man is also a romance , with two random people who are totally opposites , coming together because of their spontaneity , and how strongly and positively different a relationship which isn't routine would provide for a couple . I suppose to a certain degree I tasted some form of success at this going where the wind brings approach , though that of course was a long time back . Naturally they fall heads over heels with each other , but like all romances , there's no such thing as smooth sailing , even though this takes place in the last act and rides to the finale fairly quickly . I more than welcome Zooey Deschanel as the leading lady in Yes Man ( I would say yes too ahem ) , because in my opinion she hasn't made a lot of films , and still has that refreshing appeal . If truth be told her Allison would be someone whom I'd sit up and take notice , because of her zest for life , and hey , here's someone multi-talented ( ok , that might be debatable ) , coupled with some of her really unorthodox activities that look like fun , and miles from what I am doing anyway . I thought Jim Carrey had a field day acting opposite her , and that chemistry probably rubbed off and made them look like a cute couple who are up to totally crazy antics when they're out on their dates . Based on the book by Danny Wallace , the turning point in the film , which tied up all the random elements pretty neatly for that push toward the final act , was well done and I couldn't help but to guffaw , that if I was in those shoes , I might be connecting the dots in the same manner and asking pointed questions as well . Along with a whole host of supporting cast ranging from Bradley Cooper as Carl's best friend Peter , Molly Sims as his ex-wife Stephanie and Rhys Darby in a hilarious role as his manager ( and major geek ) Norman , the soundtrack too serves as another highlight in the film , with songs mostly by Eels , and Zooey Deschanel herself lending her vocal chords to a number of songs here , where the lyrics are totally insane ( she has part writing credit for those ) which left me laughing out loud for the most parts . So while I see the cinematic ways as to how saying Yes could change one's life but only with the intervention of fated coincidences , I guess there's no harm trying and giving the same philosophy a shot , right ? So go ahead and say Yes together with me , but of course with some intelligence and common sense , and I'd expect all of us could hope to be in for some surprising change to our personal lives . And please say Yes too to sitting through the end credits - that little skate man idea looks totally awesome !
514846	317399	465580	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Push	Push is one of those movies that gives you the deja-vu feeling that it's a quick hack job , because from the trailer alone , images of X-men as well as Star Wars come racing through your mind , what with talk about being born with special powers akin to being a mutant wanted by government agents , as well as in execution of those abilities as fluidly like a Jedi Knight would , with mind-tricks , Force Push and a prophecy to fulfil . It takes place in today's world , where some folks get to be born with powers that The Division ( aka the Dark Side ) classifies into broad terms like Pushers , Movers , Watchers , Sniffs , Shadows , Shifters , Wipers and Bleeders . Naturally there are good and bad guys within those classes , and The Division are a select few who have government backing to operate like Nazis and conduct experiments to make them all stronger , for weaponization ( yes , the DNA of the USA is to weaponize everything ) . The good guys though are not organized and are forever on the run from The Division , until a few of them decide to band together and fight for their rights . At least that would be a tad more interesting . Instead , we get a grouping of half-past-six heroes who have idled their potential and not honed it to perfection . Chris Evans ' Nick Gant is a drifter who spends his time trying to hone his powers to win in illegal street gambling . He's a mover , and one day gets found out by Dakota Fanning's Watcher just because she sees him in her hallucinatory state from the impressionistic pictures she constantly draws on a sketch pad . A lotus prophecy ( it's set in Hong Kong you see ) tells this second-generation power couple to band together in their common quest to find Kira Hudson ( Camilla Belle ) , a one time ex-flame of Nick's , and a mysterious briefcase , where by their powers and artifacts combine , they can bring down The Division , kinda like a solo shot in the dark to blow up the Death Star . Only that the promise doesn't actually get delivered because Push decided to dwell a lot on the bickering and planning stage , while leaving the intended finale either forgotten conveniently , or set aside for a straight to DVD sequel . So what makes this interesting ? Apparently I got my kicks out of watching the characters here struggle with their Cantonese . And as an action movie , it sure does have its moments , especially with that street-fighter enhanced fistfight between Nick Gant and what could possibly be The Division's most powerful Mover / Grunt Victor ( Neil Jackson ) . Djimon Hounsou plays the meanest badass in the movie with Push powers , able to command the weakest of minds ( read : supporting characters ) to do his bidding . His Henry Carver came across as a poor man's Samuel L . Jackson , and only SLJ can do what SLJ does best - be a mofo . Camilla Belle got wasted here as a damsel in distress , exhibiting some surprise moves once in a while ( and even that had implanted doubts ) , but generally nothing more than a flower vase . Dakota Fanning isn't new to the action movie genre since she had her firm grounding learning from Tom Cruise on how to run with fear ( thanks to War of the Worlds ) . I admire the now teenager in trying to put into good use her acting chops here , but the filmmakers decided to make her Cassie Holmes suffer a bad hair day throughout . Also , this film had exposed one of her flaws - while she's a good actress and all , she cannot play intoxicated ( teenage drinking to boost powers , hooray ) . Her drunkenness was one of the most unconvincing I've seen put on screen , and she too nearly wanted to break into laughter at her inability . Filmed entirely in Hong Kong , I caught glimpse from the end credits that Johnnie To and Milkyway got credited for the production . I guess if you want to film Hong Kong in a certain style , there's only the current Hot Property to turn to for consultation . Also , DOP Peter Sova had some very obvious use of the fish-eye lens that seem to mimic that of Christopher Doyle's in Fallen Angels . Most of the Chinese characters here are pretty weak , and not to mention unintentionally hilarious as well , with their shout-down powers of Pop Boy 1 ( Chi Kwan Fung ) and 2 ( Jacky Heung ) and a far superior Watcher ( Lu Lu ) trying to gain a one up against The Division through triad-styled turf wars . The plot might seem a little muddled as it tried hard to sound intelligent , and there are some illogical moments with characters popping up and about , coupled with some really tired and uninspiring lines and unclear character motivation . Not that it was an unentertaining film , it actually is . However , it's a movie purely for escapism purposes , this might just be a quick fix to your X-men addiction , if you look too much into it that you see the glaring loopholes that is .
515108	317399	407998	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Mistress of Spices	The number one appeal that this film had for me , is to see Aishwarya Rai in action . I've never seen the movies of Miss World ' 94 , and missed out on Bride and Prejudice . Written by the same team , Mistress of Spices is a mythical tale which makes the Indian spices the star of the movie , set in a medicinal store , with Rai as the conjurer and mixer of modern day " bomoh " like medicine to cure mankind of their ills . Some might not like the way the movie presented itself , with its cheesy focus and voice-over on the qualities of the various spices . Granted , it's like going to your medicinal hall , or clinic , and doing a closeup feature on the medicines and roots , characterizing them . And with the obvious red chili being the signal of danger , it's a tad simplistic . However , the way that the spices are shot , made them look beautiful in their sacks or glass bottles . Hidden behind these herbs is the mistress Tilo ( Rai , meaning sesame seed ) , whose precognitive powers are granted to her by the spices . OK , so I had a corny joke running each time Tilo asked the spices to speak to her - isn't she doing a Muad'Dib thingy like Dune's Paul Atreides ? Anyway besides the mistress helping her customers with their daily troubles by selling them wonderfully nice sounding concoctions , in comes Dylan McDermott's Doug . Better known for his leading role in the television series The Practice , he's the man unknowingly seducing Tilo from her mission in life . You see , being a mistress has its rules , and they are to never let another skin touch yours ( ooh , touchy ) , to never step out of the shop ( that's pretty restrictive and a possible loop hole ) and not to concoct anything for one's own benefit . So while trying her best to stay away from the good looking man , the movie spins into a tale of forbidden love , with punishment meted out by the powers that be dwelling within those spices - I tell you , they're quite vengeful . And as if it couldn't decide , there's an underlying reminder for Indians based overseas about never forgetting their roots and culture , to never fall for the enticing decadent lifestyle of the foreigners . But screw all that , the real star of the show is Rai . I'm already smitten by her huge twin green-blue expressive eyes with lives of their own . You could just focus on them , and they could tell you a story already . And yes , that chili-red sari , is uber hot ! Guess my to-watch movies is piling up already , with Bollywood added to the list . Rai fans probably won't want to miss this , despite the movie's relatively weak and fluffy plot .
514683	317399	482606	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Strangers	So when Underworld co-star Kate Beckinsale got to make a horror / thriller with Vacancy while waiting for the green light on a possible Underworld pre / sequel , Scott Speedman too had to do something equivalent , and so got himself signed up with The Strangers , written and directed by Bryan Bertino , which takes a fictional look at what it purports to be based on true events with regards to the senseless acts of violence committed against James Hoyt ( Speedman ) and Kristen McKay ( Liv Tyler ) . Whether it be real or not , it takes its time to tell you that more than 1 . 4 million violent crimes happen on average in the USA , which of course works out to be . . . hell a lot . And it puts this at the back of your mind that it could happen to just about anyone , which after watching the movie , you'd more or less agree , given its less than sophisticated means of attack . Ss with all horror movies coming out of Tinseltown these days , it's the usual in-your-face slasher flicks / torture porn that get made , going one up against each other through being creative with weapons , blood and gore . Here it kept things simple , using common household tools against you . It's a movie without a lot of dialog between the characters , given that the assailants do not speak with one another , or lapse into the usual monologue with their victims . They do what they need to do quickly when the time calls for it , otherwise their theatrics allow the filmmakers to max out the surround sound system in the theatre with plenty of running about , throwing of stuff against doors / windows , together with testing out their light and shadow play thoroughly . And technically , you've got to tip your hat towards its flawless execution ( pardon the pun ) . The backstory to the characters of Kristen and James show us that while they are a loving couple , James ' premature proposal to Kristen , and her rejection , put them in an awkward situation where he had plenty of yes-I-do aftermath activities planned out , such as a night at his parent's summer home , and a road trip thereafter , all thrown into disarray . They still reach that home away from home , but are not really communicating with each other . And with observed weakness comes opportunity for the perpetrators to complete their surveillance , and launch their systematic attack . Which for the first hour , it almost became the Liv Tyler show , as she single-handedly holds your attention with her frantic looks and powerful lungs , while trying to wish it all away as a bad dream . Bryan Bertino succeeds in driving through the tension and fear of having unknown strangers in an unfamiliar home , and at 4am in the morning with their constant knocking and mischievous , deadly pranks , can really take its toil on you . There are loopholes of course in this story , such as failure to hold ground , and to never , ever split up , but I guess these folks never learn from the many horror movies that preceded it . So when it went into its final 20 odd minutes , you can sense a feeling of dread , both for the characters , and the rather repetitive run-hide-seek continuum . Like Michael Haneke's Funny Games , there never is a rationale shared with the audience even though they continuously dish out violence , and while Haneke's villains were rather chatty , the ones here never bother to talk any more than they should , and coupled with their childish masks , make them a bit more terrifying when they come out of the dark . Not a masterpiece , and surely less intellectual than Funny Games , but definitely has its moments , and managed to send some chills down unsuspecting spines , like that row of punks sitting on the same row as me and actually squirmed at their seats .
515346	317399	800039	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Forgetting Sarah Marshall	Written by and starring a very naked Jason Segel , I thought this film would be incredibly easy to identify with , given that it dealt with a man who didn't see his breakup with his hot girlfriend coming in close on the horizon , until the very last minute . Starring as musician Peter Bretter , his relationship with the titular Sarah Marshall ( Kristen Bell ) came to an unexpected end with her cheating on him and moving on with new beau , rocker Aldous Snow ( Russell Brand ) . And for the most parts initially , it was easy to identify with , really , what with his failure to accept reality , and his brooding and incessant whining to friends and family , which are primarily set up for laughs . But the best bits of the comedic aspects of the story were included in the trailer , leaving only but the bland and tired one liners in the movie that failed to elicit laughter . You can almost predict how scenes are engineered toward a certain punchline , and that expectation drew away any semblance of a genuine ha-ha . The usual pop cultural references were just there , but gone are the honestly sincere approach at making a mickey out of them . So what did Forgetting Sarah Marshall really get at ? It was actually more of a classic romantic story instead , and brings to the screen very vividly , relationship challenges and issues in today's world , coupled with basic bugbears like Expectations . In a Hawaii getaway , nothing's worse than spending a vacation alone in a romantic location and bumping into your ex with her new beau in tow , living in the , horrors , next room . But Peter's luck took a change with the opportunity presented in a pretty hotel staff Rachel Jansen ( Mila Kunis ) , who in movie land would be single and available and just about finds him attractive in a certain way too . So here the dynamics get set up as we play observers to two pairs of relationships in parallel - one where sex rules above all , the other just budding with almost everything being fine and dandy . Until of course one looks back constantly over the shoulder at what was , and almost always start to appreciate things that once were . While it's always easy to do that and mope , it takes a lot of strength to be able to say no , and move on . We take comfort in the things tried and tested and sometimes lack the courage to venture out and take on life's challenges head on , but have to realize that moments that are past should stay buried in the past , and not forgo and give up opportunities to start afresh . And when you do , treasure it , and not be a dick . What I truly enjoyed in the movie , is how perceptions of oneself are likely to be skewed , where in many scenes we may sympathize with certain characters for being receiving the short end of the stick . But like how it takes two hands to clap , we're also presented the larger picture through revealing flashbacks , and realize that hey , sometimes we are selfish to always think about ME , and fail to see things from the other person's perspective , especially of loved ones whom we tend to lapse into taking for granted . Never mind if supporting cast from the Apatow Clan like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill are here to lend comedic support to the film . Forgetting Sarah Marshall triumphs for its earnest reminder about the basic things that make a relationship , and the easiest ways to break one stemming from complacency and the lack of honesty .
514616	317399	480249	8.0	A Nutshell Review : I Am Legend	Out of curiosity I went to look up Will Smith's filmography , and realized that since Michael Bay's Bad Boys in 1995 , he had averaged just one movie a year , most of them being box office successes save for blips like Wild Wild West , and in films spanning a wide genre from biopics to romantic comedy to action and drama . Today his name alone on the marquee can open a movie , and I Am Legend is probably a true test of that drawing power , because for the most parts , his Robert Neville is the last man on Earth . This film is the third to have been produced for the big screen , based on the novel of the same name by Richard Matheson . I haven't watched The Omega Man which starred Charlton Heston , but from what I've read , it's a somewhat wide departure from the source material . The Last Man on Earth , starring Vincent Price , was entertaining ( available at the Internet Archive ) and given that we're looking at it in retrospect , was told in a rather straightforward and simple manner . Will Smith's vehicle , will no doubt be updated with plenty of special effects , and getting those road closures for down town Manhattan is by no means an easy feat in itself . I've no idea why the tagline had to say " the last man on earth is not alone " , and in the poster had Smith slinging a mean rifle over a shoulder , with a German shepherd at his heel . With man's best friend as company , how can any man be alone ? Technically yes , but then his pet dog provides an avenue to keep one's sanity - any interaction that provides feedback of sorts , doesn't put you in isolation ala Tom Hanks in Castaway . And being stuck in a big city in Manhattan does have its perks , in terms of food , shelter and of course , entertainment . Of late , monster movies with the likes of the recent 28 Days / Weeks series , and in 30 Days of Night , point to an interesting observation - that we like our monsters smart , vicious and fast . In The Last Man on Earth , Vincent Price had to do battle with plodding creatures of low IQ , which formed the basis of George A Romero's walking undead . Here , the creatures bring forth a few same-old concepts , from being created by a virus ( Resident Evil series , 28 Days / Weeks probably taken a leaf from I Am Legend the book ) , filled them with crazed rage , move fast and are incredibly smart - they adapt and learn . However they fail to interest in creature designs , having look like leftovers from The Mummy franchise . Action sequences are few and far between , which ringed back to an earlier Smith movie I , Robot , but credit has got to go to I Am Legend for deftly crafting moments of intense fear and dreadful anticipation , like the sequence in the warehouse . But everything else was a chip off something else , like The Hulk's raging doggies , and with Robert Neville taking a leaf out of Sylvester Stallone's The Specialist in tactical defending , which I liked to believe his character had learned from one of his routine DVD rentals . There's even one more reference that I will choose not to quote , as it's too close to revealing how the ending turned out to be , which I felt was a little of a cop out , as the filmmakers probably had a problem in deciding how best to end this , in an honourable way befitting an A-List Hollywood star . The backstory to Neville's predicament , as an update to the original movie's explanation on the situation , brings forth a warning to those wanting to play god . Sometimes the intentions are good , but like all potential miracle cures , these have to be tested thoroughly rather than be excited over them , or worse , having those with side effects covered up . Don't expect too much of those flashbacks , like The Last Man on Earth's , they're kept short and succinct , and most of it is unfortunately in the trailer . An added plus into this version , is the lack of a dreadful need to repeat its stuff to remind audiences of Neville's routine of eat-play-send signals-find cure-find food etc , and juxtaposed time quite nicely so that it's not simply just a dawn-to-dusk day-in-the-life-of account . Directed by Francis Lawrence who brought us the big screen adaptation of Constantine , I Am Legend continues to serve as a staple for that year end big budgeted blockbuster , and in most counts , I Am Legend works , plainly because of Will Smith's charisma , and that German shepherd's company .
514861	317399	893382	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Shine a Light	The Rolling Stones was here for a concert not too long ago , but since tickets were priced way out of my league , there was no way I could have seen them in action live unless I opted for the cheapest of the lot and sat well away from the stage . So I got to thank Martin Scorsese for having design and capture some definitive moments from a Rolling Stones performance , and share that stage magic the quartet provide when they're at their element , on a celluloid screen , captured for posterity . Make no mistake , the entire movie is just like being there at a Rolling Stones concert , only that you'll have to ensure the cinema hall has great sound system installed , and you can't actually smell the sweat the rockers exude , even though you get to go really up close and personal during their performance , something which even the standing-only front row pit will not allow . You can even throw your hands up in the air only to irk those seated behind you , unless they and everyone else are game enough to turn the sedate cinema atmosphere into a party one . So this review ( if I can call it one ) largely depends on whether you're a Stones fan to appreciate , or for non-fans to want to give them a go , to kick back , relax ( if you can ) or just soak in the rollickingly wild atmosphere and immerse yourself into a Rolling Stones experience . More than 20 songs were performed ( if my mental counter serves me right ) , and for a Rolling Stones fan , you'll likely be satisfied them all for the price that you fork out . For a simple fleeting fan like me , it's an eye ( ear ? ) opener to a lot more of their music , as well as an opportunity to watch them in action on the cheap . The first 10 minutes or so was the setup , with Scorsese worrying and fussing over how to film the Stones in action , and to want to have their set of songs as early as possible so that he could plan certain shots . But of course Mick Jagger and the gang got other ideas , as they flit from performance to performance during their " A Bigger Bang " tour , only to connect physically with Scorsese when they're at the designated performance stop at the Beacon theatre for the Clinton Foundation - where you'll get to see how big a fan Bill and Hillary are , together with their 30 strong entourage . Interspersed throughout the concert performance are plenty of vignettes culled from past interviews spanning from the 60s , which will bring on some laughter as you watch them with perfect hindsight . You will get to see how youthful all of them looked when they first started out , and be amazed at their longevity in this business where bands come and go after making it to the top , if at all . Despite being grand-daddies , Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts still look in great physical condition to be touring and strutting their stuff , dishing out high energy , high performance concerts , with Watts even cheekily feinting tiredness at a point . In fact , none of them thought earnestly thought , back in their youths , that they will sustain their popularity , or would have reasons for it , except perhaps Jagger himself who jested that he had dreamt about rocking the stage into his 60s . Shine a Light doesn't break any new cinematic ground , even though it has cameras almost everywhere in a concert hall to capture every aspect and angle of the performing stage . In fact , despite Scorsese making appearances in front of the camera , his work behind it , with all due respect , could be replaced with any other director , and the outcome would probably be more or less the same , only because of the fact that it is a Rolling Stones concert with the band holding court from start to end . Would have been more of a blast to be able to see this in the IMAX version though .
515008	317399	446510	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Year of Living Vicariously	What strikes you when watching the documentary , is the split screen technique used . Amir Muhammad had taken a rare opportunity to follow an Indonesian film crew on their set of the movie Gie , a story set in the tumultuous transition of power between Presidents Sukarno and Suharto . What more , the movie was made in times of political uncertainty in Indonesia in the new millennium too . The split screen used wasn't a strict 50-50 split , but the sizes changed quite frequently from scene to scene . At times you see certain events with time juxtaposed between the screens , or events totally off tangent from one another . There are plenty of things to see and it served to be quite difficult to absorb fully the sights and sounds in just one sitting . Amir revealed that it was the first time he visited Indonesia , and so through the shoot and editing , he wanted to reflect that sensory overload in a country totally new to him . Also , they had a record number of tapes shot for this documentary , hence through the technique , enabled him to squeeze as much as he could within the run time constraint . The Year of Living Vicariously contained numerous interviews with cast and crew of Gie , be they the main leads , director , or even the cameo casts . The topics covered practically everything under the sun , but predominantly focused on current affairs and politics , in the earlier days of Sukarno / Suharto , and in the current political climate . There are quite a number of candid opinionated remarks which make you go hmm , or laugh out loud , or just poignant . And you could see shades of the style which will evolve into The Last Communist , with the song singing bits in overdrive in TLC . Probably one of the best parts about Vicariously , is the frequent interjections of folks telling Indonesian folk tales . I'm sure almost everyone in the audience love to hear stories of old , and stories spun from our neighbours ' rich history . All in all , an enjoyable movie , and after watching this and The Last Communist , I couldn't wait for Village Radio
514709	317399	478024	8.0	A Nutshell Review : S . P . L .	I was full of hope for this movie , mainly because of its stellar cast of Simon Yam , Samo Hung and Donnie Yen , and the hype up confrontation cum battle between the latter two on screen . With their martial arts background , action fans will be in for a treat . Also , with the string of disappointments so far with Mob Sister and Election ( the edited version shown here ) , I'd thought that this one would've lived up to its potential ( no coincidence that Yam was in the other 2 films mentioned ) . While I enjoyed the movie and its build up , I felt particularly let down by the ending . The beginning of the movie with its explanation of the background of the Chinese Astrology the film identifies itself with ( hence the acronym SPL ) would have set the expectation , but perhaps its the execution that I couldn't come to terms with . Then again , it provided one of the better special effects / stunt shots . It could ( and I am speculating here ) the ending was such cos " I'm the bigger star here " . But I'm digressing . It's a cops-and-robbers story that has set its main focus simply at cops going all out to nab the robber . Simon Yam and his team of maverick cops share their common hatred for Samo Hung , the same way that Kevin Costner's Elliot Ness and his Untouchables do with Robert De Niro's Al Pacino . They try to nail the mobster , but each time he goes scot free . Things get interesting when opportunity presents itself , as morality gets questioned , and highlights the good / bad / ugly , black / white / gray situations that cops sometimes find themselves in with that universal question - Do the means matter to justify the end ? Thrown into the fray is hotshot-ultracool demeanour cop Donnie Yen , who is supposed to take over from Yam as the latter is set to retire over the Father's Day weekend . He too has his loyalties challenged when he learns of the plot that Yam and team pulls . What appeals is the way these characters get sucked into a chain of events that neither can pull out from - does fate / destiny / the stars all determine the chain of events that follow ? The subplots get in the way sometimes , as the pace for the events that follow that weekend gets broken up for sentimentality - Yam's taking care of a little girl smells like Mob Sister's , a cop buddy's love for his estranged daughter bears some resemblance to The Rock's Sean Connery , and Samo Hung's love for his wife and newborn child interrupts tense moments with its dreamy mobile phone ring tone . I was also wondering whether Simon Yam found it deja-vu to be driving Yen around in a car , showing their jurisdiction - seemed too familiar with a similar scene in Election where he was driving Tony Leung around to show him their territory . Though you might expect to see punches fly between Yen and Hung , and with its M18 rating , you really don't get to see punches until at least 30 minutes into the movie . While the fight between the two upstages Daredevil's ( hero versus over-sized Kingpin ; I'm still amazed by Samo's agility at his age ) , it's really the battle between Yen and newcomer Jing Wu ( an uber-violent knife wielding villain ) that is the highlight and makes this movie worth the price of admission . It's fast , slick , violent , and beautifully choreographed , you'd just wish it could've been longer . Violent it is , and uncensored , but it doesn't get too gratuitous with blood . The fight sequences stand out for its stark brutality , and perhaps also for its realism . You must forgive the acting at times though , as there's nothing to shout about really . Simon Yam is the no-nonsense , but willing to bend the rules cop , Donnie Yen with his over-confident attitude , and Hung just hams it up as the cigar chomping Kingpin of Crime . But perhaps I would like to shout about the introduction of Yam's team to the audience when Yen visited their empty office - it's very retro , with the characters given the spotlight after undergoing a short action sequence in a police raid . On the whole , the movie works , up till the supposed ending which put me off , and where the final " hurrah " brings it down a little . It has many stylized moments accompanied with an upbeat soundtrack , but it's substance over style that matters sometimes . I'd recommend it for the stylo-mylo moments , the alleyway fight , and the suggestion that not everything can be categorized into black and white .
514974	317399	351817	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Twilight Samurai	This film chronicles the life of Seibei Iguchi , as told through the eyes of one his daughters . The film starts off with the unfortunate death of his wife , and he's left alone to bring up 2 young daughters , and a senile mother , much to the neglect of his own welfare . Despite being a lowly-ranked samurai , life is adequately comfortable , in an era of change and the coming of the end of the Meiji era . His life takes a turn when childhood sweetheart , and recent divorc√©e Tomoe Iinuma , re-enters his life . Protecting her from her violent ex-husband , love is rekindled between the two again , but Seibei , conscious of his low ranking status , is reluctant to declare his true feelings for Tomoe . It's a love story weaved into a Yoki Yamada samurai movie , and somehow I can't help but to compare and noticed some similarities between this movie , and The Hidden Blade . Politics also feature strongly in both movies , as do typical samurai themes of honour , and clan hierarchy and orders . If you're expecting to see many swordplay from the Twilight Samurai , you might be a tad disappointed . There are only 2 fight scenes in this film , one with Seibei using a wooden sword to teach Tomoe's ex-husband a lesson , and the other , a fight to the death with a clan rebel in the confines of an old house . But violence has never been Seibei's character , and fights are only seen as either a last resort ( using a non-lethal weapon ) , or only when loathing and reluctantly carrying out orders from his clan . This is a simple story of a man struggling with providing for his family , and the coming to terms within himself to be honest with his feelings . Only when faced with his own mortality , does he find the courage to do so . It is beautifully filmed , and is no wonder that it was garnered many awards in Japan's Academy Awards in 2004 , and nominated to be in competition at the Oscars as Japan's entry .
515155	317399	113011	8.0	A Nutshell Review : To Make A Film is to Be Alive	I was actually looking forward to the documentaries this week to shed some insight into the man whose films are showcased in the Retrospective , but after today's session , I'm inclined to believe I've to wait until the last week's set of documentaries to savour what I had expected . One wonders about the significance of the title , and as explained by Lorenzo Cordelli , Enrica actually had gotten some flak for getting Michelangelo Antonioni out to do film work , despite his partial paralysis from a stroke . But as the title suggests , because of high medical expenses and funds running low , he has to , unfortunately , pay the bills too , and hence his involvement in the movie Beyond the Clouds . Co-directed by Wim Wenders , we see glimpses of how Antonioni got to direct with limited mobility , though much of it had Wim Wenders in the central role of explaining Antonioni's vision and direction to cast and crew alike . From interview pieces with Wenders , we get to understand a little bit more on this collaboration process , and it explains quite clearly the dynamics between the two filmmakers on the set . What was sorely missed however , was more of Antonioni , as there wasn't any time set aside to hear what he has to share , and we can only try to understand from the little bits and pieces from his limited screen time . It's very Beyond the Clouds specific , so much so that it could be deemed as a making-of documentary of the movie , rather than a general one on Antonioni . With cast interviews from Jean Reno to Sophie Marceau , given the large number of actors and actresses featured in what essentially is a collection of short films , we get to learn more about the cast's thoughts and feeling towards Antonioni's style and direction , and to hear about their thrill of being casted in an Antonioni movie . We get to experience certain events on set , but that's about it . At most it whet my appetite for the movie , as it'll be screened only week after in this Retrospect , and to hang in there for more documentaries that will hopefully shed additional light on the big man himself .
515175	317399	454824	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Flyboys	This is yet another war movie coming out of Hollywood , but this time it leaves the dramatics and contemplative issues aside , and focus on the action pieces . With its prologue flashing across the screen that we're expecting to learn about the heroes of the war , you know the mood is set for some wham-bam pyrotechnics and stunts . Movies set in WWI are different in the sense that it's the first massive war on a near global scale , which uses various weapons for the first time , and these weapons , though standard of today , were considered weapons of mass destruction for that time with its ability to inflict mass casualties . Weapons like machine guns , tanks , planes , and even chemical warfare unleashed into the trenches are hallmarks of WWI . Flyboys , as the title puts it , turns the spotlight on a group of mostly American volunteers into the French Lafayette Escadrille , a flight squadron . With the plane a relatively new piece of technology in those days , you can trust us humans to find methods to turn technology into killing machines . If you're a fan of flight simulators of old , then Flyboys is right up your alley . For me , I've become an addict on a game called the Red Baron running on an old PC of mine , and I spent countless of hours , just like those pilots in the movie , deciding my affiliation , and flying various missions from the comfort of an armchair . And Flyboys probably took a cue , and what we have were awesome aerial combat , and beautifully modelled aeroplanes employed in missions ranging from bombing , to air defense , and even the attack on German zeppelins . However , after a while , the stunts become pretty ordinary , almost like Star Wars set in WWI , especially with the fleet's style of head to head engagements , except for the ace pilots where specific moves were developed just to show why they're top gun . And this movie does show shades of other similar movies , with the obvious one being Top Gun in the first half , where the motley crew of combatants undergo training at a flight school . It's kind of interesting to observe how training those days are conducted , since the technology and training techniques were still at their infancy . You won't get bored though , as it's almost breezing through flight school with everyone graduating because the life expectancy of a fighter pilot is between 3-6 weeks . They're falling out of the skies like flies . The other familiar element , is the romance bit . Yes , besides flying , pilots do have a life , and with movies , it just cannot do without a beautiful love interest . An accident allowed James Franco's Blaine Rawlings to meet Jennifer Decker's Lucienne , a French woman he develops feelings , but she is hesitant to reciprocate because such budding relationships during war sometimes do not last , more so when he's part of a high risk , high death unit . So what does a pilot do ? Why , set the example for Ben Affleck to follow in Pearl Harbor - take the lady up to the skies ! See the tactic ? Tried and tested I tell you ! James Franco once again plays the brooding lead , and alternates between angst and cockiness with aplomb . Girls will probably watch this movie to squeal each time he appears in uniform . Here , he's your sensitive leader , one who galvanizes his men , as well as shower tenderness on his love . Naturally , he's the recognizable star amongst the rest , besides a ground role for Jean Reno , so he's the ace ( or becoming to be one ) , trying to learn from the guru with the most kills , Reed Cassidy , your expected and seemingly cocky pilot ( wait ! Aren't pilots all ? ) There's a theme I like which the movie explored , and frequently mentioned , and that is the way battles are fought . In olden days , there is always honour , and men fought honourably , according to a moral code of conduct . Which brings us to wonder , do you prefer to fight fair , i . e . should someone lose a sword , either lose yours or allow him to pick his up ? Or do you attack enemies on parachutes by shooting at their chute ? Battle without honour or humanity just to win the fight , is what Rawlings have to come to grips with , and by the end , you will know which is the path he will take . If there's a gripe I had , it was the excessive nodding . It's an acknowledgement that you're good / bad / gonna get screwed , and while the first few might have raised some goosebumps , this particular thingamajig went on and on and on , it just turned our plain hilarious . Do something - nod , downed a bogey - nod , crap in the pants - nod . OK , so I exaggerated on the last one . All in all , it's an aviation action movie fan's wet dream . If games are to be believed , then the German planes have better specification and maneuvered better , but if you believe what the movie said , then it all boils down to the pilots . These flyboys deliver .
515287	317399	492820	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Moon and Cherry	An erotic literature writing club ? Now that's something new ! The closing film for this year's Japanese Film Festival , given the audience's most positive reaction , I'm quite certain that this edition has closed with literally a big bang . While the premise might be refreshing and sexy , at its core is an unconventional love story between a boy and a girl , in a reversal of roles from the traditional way such characters will turn out to be . The boy , Sakamoto ( Akira Emoto ) is quite soft spoken and indecisive , while the girl , Mayama ( Noriko Eguchi ) is an alpha-female , who knows what she wants , and exactly what she must do to achieve her aims , and that includes sleeping her way for it . Mayama is the writing club's only female writer , and a prolific one too , who writes under a pseudonym , and as fuel for her new novel , she engages the 21 year old virgin to the club , Sakamoto , in a cat and mouse game , using her to help translate emotions onto the written page . So while Sakamoto feels used ( having his cherry popped ) , he can't help but fall in love with Mayama , whose games get bolder and more daring as she seeks to observe how Sakamoto's experience and sexual enlightenment can provide her with a new perspective to her literary works . It's also a look at modern day relationships , and the question , to a guy , perhaps on what kinds of girls would you want to be associated with . On the other end of the spectrum , there's Akane ( Misako Hirata ) , a fellow colleague at the bookstore that Sakamoto works in . She looks better , panders to Sakamoto's wishes , basically one of the modern day cutie pies with sugar so sweet it can give you diabetes just by hanging out with her . And I thought what it was quite spot on in its offering and comparisons of the two ladies , in whether you would prefer to love and continue your pursuit for that unattainable someone , or be satisfied with and loving in return , someone who loves you a lot more ( note that I use the L-word here quite loosely ) . Moon and Cherry is a comedy of epic sexual proportions , and its digibeta format and raw look and feel does bring back certain memories of the first American Pie . However , the only drawback here is that the lighting throughout the film looked somewhat dim , but don't let that be an obstacle to enjoying a sassy , fun movie . Don't expect many laugh-out-loud moments , though Moon and Cherry certainly has its charm in punctuating portions of the narrative with very placed humour that hits you when you least expect it to .
515057	317399	1206572	8.0	A Nutshell Review : 12 Lotus	If amongst the montage of song and dance in 881 were I to pick a favourite , it will be " 12 Lotus " , though it was sung to a relatively upbeat tune . Here , 12 Lotus the song became the backbone in which the story unfolded upon , having its chapters make interludes in between scenes , though not always in consistent terms . Telling the story of Ah Hua the Pitiful Lotus ( played by both Mindee Ong and Liu Ling Ling for the different eras in a twenty year gap ) , it's a tragedy of sizable proportions about the hard life and times of a Getai singer , whose men in her life were all temporal , just like that in Jasmine Women , leaving her to fend for herself with her favorite comfort food in cream crackers , and a Goddess of Mercy statue as a security blanket . Incidentally , lead actor Qi Yu Wu was himself named Guan Yin in 881 , and his security blanket was a live chicken he carried around . There were a couple of plus points in this movie that benefited from its larger budget . Production values were clearly ramped up , and while 881 managed to get away with its knowingly non-existent crowds in its busy Getai scenes , here we have plenty of extras to jam the sessions . Costumes were less glitzy this time around , but nonetheless more gaudy . Songs too seemed to have extra oomph in them , and one performance had the screening hall's bass throbbing and pulsating non-stop . But you don't really get a host of songs featured here , which would really have been like a repeat of 881 , although this time there were newer faces from the Getai scene who were given supporting roles , and a cinematic platform to showcase what they can do to a new audience . Undoubtedly , Liu Ling Ling's fan base and profile grew with her debut cinematic outing in Royston Tan's earlier movie , but while essentially playing a larger than life version of herself in 881 , here she gets to challenge herself in a more dramatic role . In fact , I would say that this movie opened a lot of doors for the cast involved , and had everyone get out of their comfort zones . For starters , Liu's enigmatic presence throughout 881 lifted many portions of that movie , and I thought 12 Lotus was missing her charismatic screen presence for the 1st half , so fans have to patiently wait for her appearance to continue the story of Ah Hua . And even then , it's to continue the drudgery of a fallen idol , which can get heavy on the emotions , in total opposites to her Getai persona , as well as her previous roles . But that's not to say that Mindee Ong was a pushover in the earlier scenes . Given its split structure with a tragic pivot , I thought it was rather wry that there was a scene which the trailer included that involved a splashing of paint onto her during a performance , which of course brought back memories of an actual sabotage attack on her during the promotional tour of 881 last year . But Mindee again proved to have that spark and spunk to pull off Ah Hua's role , one who is willing to sacrifice a lot for the men in her life , but unfortunately , I think one mountain can't have two tigers , so she got to anchor the role in the first half , before Liu Ling Ling's taking over in the second . While Liu had two roles to play in 881 , and Qi Yu Wu didn't even get a speaking line then , it looks like payback time when Royston had Qi take on two relatively different roles here , and coupled it with song , dance , action and enough scenes to emote and show his acting chops - everything that he had missed out on . Qi can already be considered a veteran actor in the feature films already , having a number of starring roles under his belt with that in The Leap Years , 881 and The Home Song Stories , with no signs of stopping as he will soon add Painted Skin to his filmography . In jest , i had even thought 12 Lotus could have been a proper Money No Enough 2 , given almost every character here seemed to have money problems , or because of money being the perennial root of all evil , being a pretext of a lot of trouble to come . There's even a hilarious song and dance sequence which includes some very light jabbing at the policies of the authorities , but don't have me mistaken , this film is not a comedy , and even its laughable moments have a tinge of background melancholy and sadness to it , given the predicament of its characters . Supporting and guest roles would probably be crowd favourites . Huang Yiliang whom we have seen take on a cinematic role in Jack Neo's I Not Stupid 2 , lends a hand here as the compulsive gambling dad of Ah Hua , dispensing advice that was befallen on deaf years . Fans of 881 will also be glad to know that Yeo Yann Yann does return for an extremely small role here , just to complete the casting loop , while songstress Stefanie Sun gets a nice movie debut , and even David Gan seemed game to go back to basics . Hao Hao gets to play the grown up Astroboy , trusted friend of Ah Hua , but it did seem that majority of his dialogue seemed to have been dubbed over in Mandarin to avoid the risk of having the movie not clear the censors for its predominantly Hokkien dialect dialogue . Royston Tan's 12 Lotus is probably his more mature film to date , being able to balance both sensitive drama with formula and material to engage the general local movie-going audience . Sure , 881 was more fun on the whole , but 12 Lotus had a lot more pathos going for it , and that's exactly where this movie shines , learning from 881 and not indulging and allowing the melodramatic moments to go overboard .
515431	317399	495060	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Abduction : The Megumi Yokata Story	In 1977 , Megumi Yokota vanished without a trace . For 20 years her family had tried to search for an answer , but found nothing , until it was revealed that she was amongst those who were abducted by North Korean spies . The screening today opened with a video address dated in August 2007 by her parents . In it , they shared their experience in dealing with the shock , their efforts , and of course , their steely resolve in hoping that their daughter will be returned to them one day . Containing an ode to Megumi , it was a relatively short video address , but one which I thought summarized the entire movie succinctly . It's an understatement to say that kidnapping is terrible , for both the victim and the parents . But one done without a ransom provided , leaves little clues to the parents , and here , sparked off intense sorrow that I'm sure any parent can identify with - the love and effort in raising a child , now so suddenly taken away with you , with zero trace . There's absolutely nothing to fall back on - no motive , no eyewitnesses , no prior abnormal behaviour noticed , nothing . This documentary charts the 30 years of the time of the abduction until now . It tells of the journey and struggles of Megumi's parents , but provides as a launchpad , an introduction into a mystery unravelled . While the act of kidnapping itself might seem one-off and random , but the putting together of little facts gathered throughout Japan by investigative journalists provided the bigger picture , and ultimately , the ability to point a finger , suggest motives , and seek closure . But closure is something not easy to come by . For those who have been following press reports in recent years , you might have read a bit about the incidents starting from Japan's ex-Prime Minister Koizumi's historic visit to North Korea , and the release of some of the abductees in return for food and medical aid . Diplomacy seemed to be the best , and the only course , for Japan to engage North Korea . North Korea has shown that it doesn't negotiate easily , and it tends to flip flop around given its poor track record and ambiguous and conflicting , unconvincing evidences . Abduction managed to piece together a compelling narrative , and at some times , horrifying too , at how random and perhaps senseless these acts are . But it does suggest some reasons why these Japanese were abducted , and mostly for espionage and training reasons , which seemed highly plausible . What was suspect though , and also not probed in depth , was interviews with the returned abductees . I thought that given it managed to talk to a North Korean defector , it would also be able to get those folks to open up . But perhaps they do not want to talk about their ordeal , or that it's classified information for confidential debriefing only , or like they mentioned , to ensure the safety of those still held by NOrth Korea , one will never know . On a more personal scale , it charts the emotional turmoil and immense efforts by Megumi's parents to champion for the return of their daughter . Red herring , doctored evidence , and even something that should provide the most compelling evidence by far were all rebutted . It's understandable , and the documentary seemed to support and debunk whatever evidence that turns up . There's nothing like parents love , and this film captured all that . 30 years of hope and continued fighting for the truth shows all that . And it is their personal wish that these atrocities are made known to as many people as possible .
514521	317399	468704	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Daisy	Flowers ! If it's one thing you'll take away from this movie , it's gonna be the flowers . They feature so prominently and are used as plot devices , you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends . Set in Amsterdam , Daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life . One a professional hit-man eking out a living , the other an Interpol agent . Featuring a Pan-Asian cast ( Korean , Hong Kong ) and crew ( director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong , writer from Korea , and a Thai post production team ) , I could imagine the headaches in coordination . Park Yi ( Jung Woo-sung ) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter Hye-young ( played by the pretty Jeon Ji-hyun ) . It's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies , where her clumsiness caught his attention . However , being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career , he can only admire her from afar , do little ( or perhaps big ) things for her in an anonymous fashion , but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4 : 15pm . He becomes her guardian angel from afar , shielding her and keeping her safe from harm . Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger . She is constantly waiting for him to appear , but I really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery . Nonetheless , she's terribly moved , and touched by this sole act . However , as the stars would have it , interpol detective Jeong Woo ( Lee Sung-jae ) chances upon Hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions , and he too is captivated by her . In a similar fashion , because of his profession , he is doubtful if he should make the first move . Which is where the audience would find it frustrating . The lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy ( then again , it's the " good " guy ) , Park Yi being infuriated by Jeong Woo's pursuit , but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself , and Jeong Woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly . It's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up . That aside , it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued . And it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers , or their loved one . But fret not action fans , there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of Infernal Affairs , as well as ample gunfights , although I felt the ending could have been scripted tighter . What rocks is the clever editing . Telling the story in a non-linear timeline ( no worries , it ain't that bad , you'll still be able to follow the narrative ) from the points of view of all the leads , keeping you in suspense , and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event , which I thought was extremely well-done . It's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares , with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul . As with romance movies , all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads , while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced ( argh ! OK lah , at certain angles ) Jeon Ji-hyun . If you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action / tension department , then Daisy would be your choice . If you prefer a more conventional weepy , then the other Korean movie making its debut here at the same time , You are My Sunshine , would be your alternative . And yes , I totally dig the ending scene , which I thought only the Koreans do it best ? Kinda reminded me of the JSA one .
515488	317399	479500	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Nancy Drew	I last read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago , so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty . From what I gathered , the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time ( for my case , the 80s and early 90s ) , with Hardy Boys , Famous Five , and of course , " Carolyn Keene " ' s Nancy Drew amongst the more famous ones . I still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations , usually quite heavy ( for a kid ) to lug around , and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts . Well , the character has been given some updates along the way , as I recall my sister's subsequent Nancy Drew books becoming less thick , of softcover , with updated and a more chic Nancy illustrated on the cover . I can't remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones , but I guess these books , being ghostwritten , have their fair share of updating itself for the times . In this Warner Brothers release of Nancy Drew , the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times , but somehow the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen maintained her 50s - ish small town sensibilities , thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm , folks like me , would appreciate . Her fashion sense , her prim and properness , even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her , well , Nancy Drew . Her family background remains more or less the same , living with her single parent father Carson Drew ( Tate Donovan ) , who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity , and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of River Heights . Mom is but a distant memory , and the housemaid makes a cameo . But what made Nancy Drew work , is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role . Niece of her famous aunt Julia , she too possess that sprightly demeanour , that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile . Her Nancy Drew , while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way , actually will grow on you . And in almost what I thought could be a discarded scene from Pretty Woman , it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactions . While Dad Carson Drew tries hard to bring Nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life , trust Nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner , a Hollywood type has been , was found murdered under suspicious circumstances . Mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity , and not before long we're whisked off along with her on her big screen adventure . There's nothing too Black Dahlia about the crime and mystery , and instead it's a pretty straightforward piece for Nancy to solve , in between befriending Corky ( Josh Flitter ) a chubby friend from school , and pacifying jealous boyfriend Ned ( Max Thieriot ) , while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad . The story's laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms , and together , it becomes somewhat scooby-doo like . With minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions , this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with " chick flick " alert . I guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans , rekindle the memories of old ones , and probably , just probably , might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers .
515319	317399	416320	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Match Point	Written and directed by Woody Allen , it surprisingly doesn't feel like what I would have expected from an Allen film , nor did I think that I had the patience to sit through one . However , this movie had converted me to wanna watch what Allen had to say in his earlier movies , not that this movie , in my opinion , is representative of the legendary director's style . Match Point , through its trailers , looked like another Closer , with its look at one aspect of the modern spousal relationship - that of adultery and fidelity . However , Closer had a more sophisticated plot and relationship tangles amongst the chief characters , while Match Point took on a more straightforward approach . You could say it's like The Talented Mr . Ripley , with the similar focus on one man and his actions to deceive all around him . Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton , an ex-tennis professional turned coach in England . He befriends one of his students Tom Hewett ( Matthew Goode ) , and is somewhat smittened by his sister Chloe ( Emily Mortimer ) . Being aimless and at a cross junction of his life , Chloe and her wealthy family presents Chris a possible path down a ready made high flying boardroom career and a stable family . But of course , the fun and trouble comes in the form of Tom's fianc√©e Nola Rice , the one with the come-hither looks , played to scandalous perfection by Scarlett Johansson . It's a dilemma to men with the lack of self-control , as Chris goes all out to straddle two boats , and starts to question which is love , and which is lust . One cannot expect to take the cake , and eat it as well . What was really neat is the presentation of the dilemma in a cold , calculated manner - do you want to continue being with your wife who endears herself to you , for all the material comfort enjoyed thus far and knowing that you have a known future laid out in front of you , or would you seek to give them all up to be with someone volatile , with an uncertain future for both when you seek to choose the mistress ? This is possibly Allen's longest film to date , and it really feels that way . He takes the time to set up the entire premise , treating us to operas as the philandering Chris enjoys marital ( and economic ) bliss , while at the same time scheming to bed his mistress regularly on the side with loads of quickies . But the beauty of it is in the second act , where what exactly will go wrong in such an adulterous relationship , will . The final act , while probably fitting for a man in extreme desperation , seemed a bit too Hollywood , despite this being done in collaboration with BBCFilms . It relied too much on Luck , just as the opening sequence of the determination of a match point when the ball hits the net . It's plainly simple - either side will mean you'll either win or lose . Rhys-Meyers put on a convincing performance as the guilt-ridden , pleasure seeking Chris , with his loathing of being with his wife , and oh-so-eager puppy dog looks when being with his mistress . At least while she's still not that demanding . As I mentioned , Johansson played the sexy-come-hither chick to perfection , but somehow I felt that she lacked the ability to exude the emotional depth of a mistress who steps up her almost impossible to meet demands from a man who cannot decide , or have the strength to tell his wife of his affairs . Glenn Close she is not . So be warned that this film might seem to plod on , with scenes that you might think could be excluded to tighten up the pace . However , do pay attention to the dialogue , as it often proves rewarding , and to those who are thinking of having affairs , think twice - the trouble when you happen to get yourself attached to an emotional wreck , could be tough to deal with . Luck may not be on your side .
515389	317399	384369	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Napola - Elite f√ºr den F√ºhrer	Napola refers to elite military National-Political Schools , set up to train promising young German talents into potential future leaders for the Third Reich - Man makes History , but Napola makes the Man . Set at the peak of Hitler's Nazi regime in 1942 , this film explores the very different lives of two youths enrolled in such a school , and exposes some of the difficult training programme that these youths are put through . Friedrich Weimer graduated as a Hitler youth , and spends time juggling work with boxing . Impressing a talent scout with his boxing skills , he gets recruited into one of the Napola schools , to be trained as an athlete to bring the school glory . Coming from a poor home , he sees this as a chance to bring wealth for this family , although they disagree with his joining the Napola . Albrecht Stein is the son of the governor . What he lacked in the brawn department , he makes up with his gift for the written word , which often goes unappreciated , even with his parents . Two youths from different backgrounds bond together as good friends , as they undergo the tough regimental training the school has to offer . At times , it's like Dead Poet's Society in a WWII German military setting , where they challenge and subtly question the establishment and their methods . Even though the school is made up of a recruited pool of the privileged few , basic evils of man persists , like corruption and jealous rivalry . The different subplots and set action pieces unravel our protagonists ' characters , and we see them develop in depth . From a wide-eyed promising talent , we journey with Friedrich as he slowly comes to terms with evaluating if one should sell out one's beliefs for fame and wealth , blinding the disappointment faced in the system . Albrecht , while meek looking , held on to his ideals , especially after a sad episode in the fields , and when being forced into a corner to renounce this ideal , found untold courage to actually do what he did , at the expense of everything else - friendship , family . Which brings us to question , how many of us , if knowing what's right , will do the right thing , or take the easy way out and turn our backs towards the truth ? We are also exposed to the highly fanatical training methods of the Nazis , of showing no pity , and signs of cowardice are treasonous . Those who've undergone some form of army training will appreciate the nature of military training - from the physical exercises , punishments , and stand-by-bunks , to the bonding of bunk mates and " suffering " under the hands of sadistic superiors . It is no surprise that Napola won various awards for film , acting and direction , It's rich cinematography and haunting soundtrack brings to life Nazi Germany of 1942 , and highlighting the horrors of the training of an elitist school of soldiers and future governors , with its expected training tragedies . This is a movie with powerful themes , with an introspective look at the development of man under difficult fanatical regimes revealed in a moving drama .
514692	317399	434139	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Last Kiss	When you're in your twenties , you feel invincible . Fresh out of school , and with a world of opportunities ahead of you , the general feeling is that nothing can go wrong . At least that's how I felt . And so far , nothing drastic has knocked me off my feet , or grounded my perceived progress to a halt . That is , until you hit the big three-oh , and start wondering about a whole host of issues , like what you're going to do with your life , are you going to settle down with that someone special if he / she exists , and essentially , what the heck happened in the last 10 years which seem to just whizz by , as if the decade just passed by without any significant milestones . And the male characters in The Last Kiss , are about the same age as I am , and in this story , they take a long hard look and evaluate heir circumstances , albeit all from a relationship point of view . Adapted from a Spanish movie L'ultimo Bacio with a screenplay by Paul Haggis ( who also wrote the screenplays for Casino Royale and Flags of Our Fathers now out in theatres ) , The Last Kiss stars Zach Braff as Michael , our guy who's stuck at the crossroads of his life . Everything's fine and dandy , great job , hybrid car , and living in with his pregnant girlfriend Jenna ( Jacinda Barrett ) . However , that contemplation of life , of what's next , and his disbelief about marriage , has forced him to seriously think about the future . He's unsure , and in his vulnerable state , gets very tempted by a younger , beautiful girl , Kim ( Rachel Bilson ) when she throws herself at him . Yes , Rachel Bilson from TV's OC has followed in the footsteps of fellow OC hot babe Mischa Barton , playing yet another sweet nubile temptation in their big screen debut ( Barton did her tour in The Oh in Ohio ) . As the seductress , her character totally loses herself in the company of Michael , and feminists in the audience would roll their eyes and find it hard pressed to find a valid reason to fall for that cad Michael , who is definitely tempted and should have stuck to his guns . Although the spotlight is definitely centered on this story arc , there are a few others which focus on Michael's friends , all hitting their 30s , and each facing dilemmas in their own right . Chris ( Casey Affleck ) is not getting along with his wife , who's high strung from taking care of their kid , Izzy ( Michael Weston ) cannot get over his ex girlfriend , and is actually an obsessive wuss , upset at her ability to move on so easily , and Eric Christian Olsen as Kenny the hipster player who's totally non-committal . Interactions between the guys are limited though , and each potential short story arc brings forth potential unexplored in full . But perhaps we have to leave it to the older folk to shed some light in this movie . Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson somehow light up the screen with their chemistry , as two elderly married couple who are at odds with each other , because of the lack of some tender loving affection showered upon the other . Harold Ramis makes a surprise appearance , and he's almost ballooned to twice the size since his lean Ghostbusters days . I'd actually thought I could easily identify with the broad issues faced by the host of characters here , but given it's focus just on relationships , it was a little below expectations . Nonetheless , it's one movie whose themes do set you thinking , especially about the touchy issue on fidelity ( hence , who's the recipient of your very last kiss ? ) , and even then it doesn't end by making any bold statements , but it chose to sit on the fence .
515080	317399	1135985	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sex Drive	Despite what I would deem as a glut as far as teenage sex comedies are concerned , it's easy to have seen one to have seen them all , but Sex Drive still managed to arrest some attention from start to end because the screenplay by John Morris and director Sean Anders , based on the book " All The Way " by Andy Behrens , has plenty of genuinely funny moments , delivered by an excellent fresh faced cast supported by unlikely veterans hamming it up . Like all road trip related movies , from Harold and Kumar , to Road and Euro Trips , amongst a lot more others , there's always your virginal protagonist who is luckless in getting laid , and the premise has it all set up for him to do so en route to his deflowering destination . And sticking to formula , it dictates that you must have a wise-cracking sidekick who knows all , and / or done it all . If American Pie has its Stifler , then Sex Drive's equivalent would be the unlikely and pudgy Lance ( Clark Duke ) as his trash-talking mad humping equivalent , goading his best friend virgin Ian ( Josh Zukerman ) on to make a half-cross country trip to meet the internet girl of his dreams Ms Tasty ( mm mmm , Katrina Bowden ) , who offered to go all the way should he arrive in his ( brother's actually ) sweet GTO . So on the guise of visiting his ailing grandmother , Ian brings along Lance ( who's in on the plan ) , as well as best female friend Felicia ( Amanda Crew ) who along the way discovers that this road trip isn't exactly as innocent as it seems . And of course it plays to the usual notion that the one you seek is always forever just by your side and not halfway across the world . It's the same ol ' message , but delivered in a totally hilarious package . The strength of the story doesn't like on any marquee name making facial fools of themselves , but having to inject some wonderfully ( and sometimes obscene ) moments that catch you offguard , sometimes like a frat boy joke , but definitely laugh out loud . As you know with comedies these days , they usually taper off toward the end , or suddenly decide to go all mushy and dramatic . Here , the filmmakers saved the best bits for last , where everything converged together in one madcap finale , and doesn't fizzle out until the very last minute . And that means right up until the very last scene after the end credits roll . Two characters here stand out , and they're not leading roles though . The first would be a very buffed up James Marsden as Ian's brother Rex , who owns the GTO and exploits every opportunity to ridicule his kid brother . The second role , and a scene stealing one at that , belonged to Seth Green's Ezekiel , a sarcastic Amish fella who has the very best lines , and delivered so succinctly , if there was an award for best comedic performance , I'll give it to him in this role , hands down . Political correctness gets thrown out the window , and there are plenty of gaudy jokes involving various body parts . So if this is not your cup of tea , the recommendation would be to skip it as you're likely to frown more often than laugh . Naturally there are some loopholes and continuity errors that were obvious , but don't let those get to you . If you're really up for some good dose of laughing medicine to chase those blues away , then Sex Drive would be that perfect silver bullet .
514559	317399	1179271	8.0	A Nutshell Review : 10 Promises to My Dog	You probably cannot count just how many doggie movies are out there , with its fair share coming out of Japan . Neither can I , and ever since Hachiko I thought none could stand up to the loyalty of that dog , but I guess I was wrong . You think you know the usual drill when it comes to stories about man's best friend , but I guess one can always count on the Japanese to weave a story based on much melodrama that somehow works , no matter if it at first glance might seem to be familiar . Like how the dog remains unflinchingly loyal to its owner , good or bad in its owner's treatment of it . Or how it can always be relied on to provide that listening ear , even though they obviously don't speak our language , or best of all , how as a puppy the camera always capture their best angle to make you wish you could go home to one who that will always wag its tail and playfully pounce on you as a greeting , as if you're the best person in the world that stepped through the door . The 10 promises referred to here isn't exactly 10 of the best that one would actually commit to the pet , but rather , a pact of understanding from both parties that build on trust . And that turns out to be key to the story , as it extends not only between animals and man , but across relationships that both parties will forge with others and fellow species as well . In fact , some of these serve as universal reminders , and I suppose young kids who are brought to see this G-rated film , will probably come to understand that it takes a lot of responsibility to take care of a pet , especially when one's priorities in life tend to change as one grows up within the average lifespan of , in this case , a dog . Told over 10 years , the film stars Mayuko Fukuda and Lena Tanaka as the character of Akari , a young girl who seem to suffer from setback after setback ranging from family to relationship issues , despite her sunshine cheery demeanour . And the best parts in the movie pertain to the carefully crafted story about family , about being there for your loved ones , and making precious moments count . And with the 10 promises , we will journey with Akari to see if she can commit to the pact successfully , or not . But it's not just a story about a girl and her dog , and there's where this movie shines in being different from the usual run off the mill stories . There's a small sub plot involving Akari's golden retriever Socks in its ability to become a therapy dog , both for herself , and good friend Hoshi ( Ryo Kase ) . And it chief strength was in how it weaved a very nice , touching story about family , of being there every moment that you can , and making such moment matter . Just like how Akari's father Saito ( Etushi Toyokawa , in a role that perhaps many can identify with ) places work in a higher priority than family in order to put bread on the table , but realizes that work just isn't everything as time will just pass you by . And it served as an interesting parallel when Akari loathes her father's non-presence , but slowly we see her succumbing to these same attitudes as well , much to the disappointment of , well , everyone else . Despite a romantic angle being ploughed into the movie at its midpoint on , its family one still stood its ground and delivered the melodramatic payload when it mattered , to tug at your heartstrings during the inevitable finale . And while listening to the Japanese cast bravely sing their way through Time After Time , I'd figured that while it fit the movie nicely with the message it wanted to bring across , perhaps this version of the song will sooth calm nerves : Highly recommended if you have never seen a movie about man and his best friend , or if the last one you've watched was a few years ago . Otherwise you should know what to expect when it goes into dramatic overdrive .
514841	317399	420238	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Tale of Despereaux	Never did I think that The Tale of Despereaux would have all it takes to be a fairy tale in the spirit of Stardust , and I had actually found myself enjoying this tale from once upon a time , which provided entertainment to children , and not leave the adults in the lurch thanks to its rather mature story that spread out like a hydra thanks to the myriad of colourful characters inhabiting its kingdom of Dor , where citizens enjoy the yearly ritual of witnessing and subsequently tasting the soup of the year created . There's a difference between a mouse and a rat , as far as likability and the cuteness factor goes . And central to the story are a world-weary rat Roscuro ( voiced by Dustin Hoffman ) who lives aboard a ship and finds himself grounded in part due to his love for good food , and that of an innocent mouse with a big heart , the titular character Despereaux ( Matthew Broderick ) , who is smaller in size than the average mouse , but born with big Dumbo like ears which he uses to great effect . Roscuro's presence in the kingdom happens to be the root cause of the king having to ban soup and outlaw the presence of rats in his kingdom , and disappears for a while in the middle section of the story , leaving room for Despereaux to step up to the central role . We learn that Despereaux is no ordinary mouse , not only in physical terms , but in character , because he knows no fear and very much unlike the other mice who must learn to be meek and cower as an innate response to danger . For his steadfastness in holding true to his principles , he finds himself banished as punishment for speaking to Princess Pea ( Emma Watson ) , and so paves way for the little one to exhibit the values of honour , chivalry , loyalty and courage , stuff in which he found appealing from a story book that he read , with which he imagines himself to be a mouseketeer / knight . What made this movie work , are the many threads and characters in seemingly disparate narrative arcs , where you can't help but to anticipate how they would all come together . Each character created was quite balanced in having grey area to tread , so that the theme of forgiveness could ring through . And having a star studded cast to voice them worked wonders too , such as Tracey Ullman , Kevin Kline , William H . Macy , Ciaran Hinds ( who is also in this week's Race to Witch Mountain ) , Frank Langella , Christopher Llyod and Sigourney Weaver as the narrator , which quite interestingly , doesn't always narrate verbatim to what's shown on screen . Each character has their own motivation put out clearly , and while some , like the key characters , have their work cut out for them , you can rely on the support cast to liven up things a little and provide some comic relief . I guess the animation studios in the west have already reached a plateau in terms of the technical know-how in putting out a photo-realistic animated film these days . You can imagine the texture of the animal's fur , as well as the smell of the dark and stank underground city of Rat Town , or the perfumed sweetness that comes with a princess ' room . It goes to show that the benchmark has been raised permanently , and it will take many years and larger budgets if local animated film studios ( that have given us cringeworthy titles to date , with poor stories and poor graphics ) are thinking of reaching the same heights . Not wanting to put them down , but they have to understand that a strong story is key ( and doesn't mean you tweak it to suit the flavour of what you think will sell ) in order for the animation to do its part ( e . g . Barnyard ? excellent CG art , but poor story = box office disaster ) . The Tale of Despereaux again is family friendly fare save for one scene which I thought might be pushing the envelope a bit ( for a children's G-rated film that is ) . Other than that , for those looking for a more adult fairy tale , give this mouse a chance , and in all honesty , this little guy got more spunk than Ratatouille . Recommended !
515328	317399	307681	8.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) I Not Stupid ( 2002 )	OK , I admit that the reason why I'm watching this - it's homework for the upcoming sequel which I intend to watch when it's released in the local theaters . Therefore I needed to be acquainted with the source material other than bits and pieces from the extended television serial . Jack Neo has made movies which have been box-office successes locally , grossing millions , starting with the very popular , but very raw , Money No Enough . It captured the attention and appealed to the heart-landers , who gave him a resounding vote of confidence at the box office . Following that are many social dramadies like That One No Enough , Liang Po Po , and the likes . But perhaps none struck the chord so closely , as that jab at the typical Singaporean kiasu-parents , school administrators who are fearful of their rankings , the much criticized EM1-2-3 streaming in primary schools , and the introduction of perceived foreign talent on our shores . And that's what I Not Stupid is about , and more . Compared to his previous movies , I Not Stupid has matured in refining its story telling techniques , having social issues subtly weaved into its dialog , and giving the audience the ability to draw chuckles out of caricatures of the government in its characters ( Selena Tan as the big-momma , dressed in all white , all the time , anyone ? ) The casting also took some major changes , without having J-Team members as lead characters here . The 3 child leads did quite OK , given that they have veterans actors as their parents helped a lot too . The plot did seem to wear on as it seemed to drag to make it 2 hours , which contributed to quite a bit of plot holes . Also , some subplots seemed unnecessary too , or if retained in the film , wasn't succinct to the point , like the kidnapping subplot . However , if you've been following Jack Neo's movies , then it is marked improvement . The jokes are less slapstick , though it was kinda strange to have characters telling jokes , and everyone around laughing . Not that it was bad , just quite unnaturally acted . So am I ready for I Not Stupid Too ? Frankly , yes . Though the trailer did not reveal too much except for the public caning scene , I'm silently geared up for more social issues being taken to the stand , and awaiting to see how Jack Neo spins them together for another ride . Special Edition Code 3 DVD contains 2 music videos from the movie , song lyrics , packaged into a pictorial book containing the synopsis and cast and crew interviews and biographies .
514954	317399	117571	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Scream ( DVD 1996 )	It actually took me 9 years to finally watch this slasher flick classic , and I'm now kicking my rear that I should've watched it when it premiered in local theatres back then . Credited as sparking off a slew of copycat slasher films in the late 90s , and reintroducing Wes Craven to a whole new generation , Scream will remain an important milestone for the horror-slasher genre . Starring a relatively young and unknown ( then ) cast , Drew Barrymore opens in what is probably the most recognizable start to a horror movie , with her demise after being caught in a cat-and-mouse telephone call with the primary killer in the movie , a psychopath who dons the Halloween " Scream " costume . That famous opening aside , Neve Campbell plays the main lead Sydney , a student who's now the new target of the killer . Given her complicated background of having her mom killed about a year ago , she is spooked by the fact that she could have sentenced the wrong killer to prison , and the real one is still out there , stalking her . As with slasher movies , her group of friends become suspects and cannon fodder for the killer . What works is that although the cast is huge , and almost everyone is a suspect ! The film doesn't let off throwing at you the red herrings , making you wonder what could be , and if it is . Looking at the film , the killer is not the invulnerable being that always gets his prey . Here , he does get hit and attacked , which adds a totally new , believable dimension towards the instinct for survival . Also , there are tons of movie references which will keep every movie buff totally happy and jumping with glee at identifying them . I'd like the part where one of the characters laid down the 3 rules of horror films : Never have sex because only virgins survive , never smoke or drink , and never say " I'll be back " , because you won't . Sort of summarizes every horror movie out there , doesn't it ? And the ending totally rocks . The script is intelligent ( for a horror-slasher movie ) , and will catch you off guard , if you haven't been reading anything to spoil the movie , after 9 long years . Sadly , this Code 3 DVD contains no extras besides the norm of scene selection and subtitles . Pity .
515284	317399	762107	8.0	A Nutshell Review : I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry	Folks would have remembered Kevin James as the affable guy who needed help from Will Smith to hook up with girls in the romantic comedy Hitch . Which I thought was a little strange , because , and I'm not gay , James comes across in likable terms . In Chuck and Larry , he's the latter , again looking for help as his job as a firefighter puts him in considerable risks , and wants to ensure that his children's welfare is taken of in the unfortunate event that he goes . So who can a man turn to except to his best friend , Chuck ( Adam Sandler ) , through a vowed favour to repay . In order go get around red tape , he has to marry somebody who will get his insurance dollars and use that to care for his children . And since same-sex domestic partnership is in , why not exploit it with none other than a buddy whom you have known for considerable time ? But of course getting a ladies man to forever ditch his gallivanting ways is a tall order , and worse , having him to declare that he's gay is akin to asking him to lose all his limbs ( yes , including that one ) . And to a test of their brotherly friendship and marital vows , temptation comes in the form of hot lawyer Alex ( Jessica Biel , who looked smokin hot with those glasses ) , who proves to be too much to handle for the women-loving Chuck . Is it always that women will let down their guard with a gay guy who proves to be a best of both worlds confidante ? Expect the usual gay and homophobic jokes to spew from the movie . However , Chuck and Larry somehow had a lot more heart in it than anyone would like to credit it for . While touching on certain gay issues does allow it to receive some punching bag treatment to bring on some laughs , I felt that it was not so much about gayness or a gay show , than it is about the friendship amongst the bestest of friends , you know , the one whom you can slug it out with when your views differ , but no sooner than the fists are put away , you can hit the nearest pub and down some pints together . While you may argue that it tackles the gay issue and opposition to them in a rather superficial manner , I thought it covered a lot of ground , and while they may be disguised under laughter , actually had very serious and contemporary issues brewing underneath it all . It may seem like a platform mouthpiece , but provides a very succinct coverage of the discrimination and prejudice these same-sex lovers face from society . The supporting cast here are recognizable faces , although reduced mostly to caricatures , like Dan Aykroyd , Ving Rhames , and Steve Buscemi as a federal employee fraud investigator that you would just love to hate , especially with his disgustingly unhygienic coin pouch and irritating demeanour . I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is a pretty even comedy with dramatic and touching moments . It's a romantic comedy with an added dimension , filled with an excellent soundtrack from acts like Wham , PM Dawn and even Cyndi Lauper . Oh , and you'll never look at , or use postal terms , ever the same again !
514579	317399	461770	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Enchanted	How does she know , you love her ? Probably by bringing her to watch Enchanted , a movie with the words " chick flick " rubber stamped all over it . I've got to admit my friend offered to hook me up on a blind date with a hot chick because she wanted to watch this movie , and I had unsuccessfully persuaded him to bring her out on this movie date himself . Anyway if you're reading this , you should , because it has a winning formula ! The trailers would have suggested that this was going to be a madcap time , with a Disney movie poking fun at most of its classics , drawing inspiration from , and then taking a mickey out of it . You have a princess-wannabe Giselle ( Amy Adams ) , an animated character modeled quite generically from beauties like Snow White , Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty et al . Thrown in a Prince Charming named Edward ( James Marsden ) , and his evil stepmother The Queen ( Susan Sarandon ) , with evil hag disguise to boot . And with her greed to hold onto the Kingdom , she prevents the love-at-first-sight / song couple from marrying , and banishes Giselle to The Big Apple . With zero help and all the wrong moves and polite demeanor , she finds herself in the unlikely friendship of Robert Philip ( Patrick Dempsey ) and his daughter Morgan ( Rachel Covey ) . And here's when the movie starts to come alive with its inane scenes drawn from the Disney archives to bring on the chuckles , down to full blown musical numbers that are just plain charming . If Disney animated movies of yester-years have lovey dovey songs ( listen carefully to the background music to spot some recognizable Disney tunes ) , poisoned apples , dragons , henchmen , magic mirrors ( ha ! ) , witches , glass slippers , gorgeous costumes and cute furry animals , this movie has them all . But aside from the predictable elements that make a Disney cartoon a Disney cartoon , it boiled down to what's core in such fairy tales : True Love's Kiss . The one thing that every Disney female character yearn for from their hero . It's a typical fairy tale plot , but in its fish out of water storyline , it offered a clash of two different worldly views on the notion of love . For Giselle , it's always been happily ever afters after a shotgun meeting - boy meets girl , girl loves boy , they get married and live in a huge castle . In the real world we're so familiar with , Robert epitomizes the modern day notions of long drawn courtships , the trying to find out everything you can about the other half , for compatibility reasons , the contemplation whether you can live forever ( which is such a long time ) with the other half , and the option to divorce always hanging overhead when things don't work out . It's a clash of two different perspective from different worlds , and needless to say opposites do attract , henceforth providing a sort of dilemma as both parties are to be married to their respective partners . Amy Adams is Enchanted , without whom the movie will fall flat . She sings the songs , dances the joyous dance , squeals in delight at every new experience , and is the typical bambi-eyed beauty who finds positivity in everything , even when they are heading south . I guess I'm attracted to optimism , and no doubt , her character of hope had naturally struck a chord in me ( same thing goes for Kirsten Dunst's Claire in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown ) . When she opens her mouth and sings to invoke the innate powers of all Disney heroines , the ability to charm animals from afar to do her bidding , you've gotta see this one as it just cracks you up with the type of beings she conjures in New York . In her own ditzy manner , her Giselle will undoubtedly find a soft spot in your heart . Playing her two leading men are Patrick Dempsey as the world-weary divorce lawyer whose pessimism is soon to take an hard knock from Giselle's infectious attitude towards love , and James Marsden as the very himbo-like Prince Edward , all brawn , a naturally glib tongue , and perhaps a hint of an airhead ( Is it me , or are female characters these days becoming more Alpha-typed ? ) . Susan Sarandon got top billing too in this movie , and while she looks quite the part as the evil Queen , it's a pity that her screen time had been severely limited , lending more of her voice instead rather than appearing in the flesh . Throwaway characters include Timothy Spall as the no good henchman Nathaniel , and an animated chipmunk Pip ( noises by the director Kevin Lima himself in the NY version ) which seems to be the precursor to more of the same once Alvin and the Chipmunks hit the screen next month . In true Disney fashion , Enchanted goes back to basics with its message , that there must always be hope that one day you'll meet your true love , whether they drop in from the sky , or crawl out of the sewer . Almost a no-brainer choice for dating couples looking for fluffy chick flick entertainment .
514503	317399	469494	8.0	A Nutshell Review : There Will Be Blood	Money is the root of all evil . It's needed to fuel the economy , and it's needed to further various gains , be it personal , political , and even religious to a certain extent . Too much money and people will see green , wanting to know the secret formula to creating and hoarding wealth , because of the various forms of satisfying utility that comes with the spending of money . And precious commodity like oil which is in high demand , automatically equates to wads of cold hard cash . Written and directed by Paul Thomas Andersen , There Will Be Blood brings us to the early 20th century , where it chronicles the exploits of a certain Daniel Plainview ( Daniel Day - Lewis ) , who discovers oil deposits during silver mining , and hedges a bet on the right horse . Calling himself an oil man , he designs his persona as being a humble family man , with his adopted child H . W . , so as to lower his level of threat as he goes around acquiring land which has the prospect on sitting upon oceans of oil buried deep down . It's a very shrewd move , and a card that he plays to perfection , hiding a cruel mean streak that he possesses deep within . A teenager approaches him one day with leads that his family and the entire neighbourhood of simple rural folk , are sitting atop a potential gold mine . Without further ado , Daniel and son qualifies this lead , and hurriedly entice the folks to sell their estate to him . And here's where the compelling argument for the proposal take place , where even you'll be hard pressed not to agree with , of the boost in the local economy that the oil money will bring - better infrastructure , better crops for food , educational opportunities , jobs all round , and the likes . But Eli Sunday ( Paul Dano ) plays the hard game with Daniel , and requests for a church to be built for him , to further his ambition of being the defacto faith healer in the community . And of course , such deal breakers are never in the good books of shrewd businessmen like Daniel , and the two of them set down the path of adversity , with the playing of games with each other , obvious snubbing , and total disgust . We see how the upper hand swings and shifts from one character to the other in their struggle for power over the community - one through the economy , the other through religion . And it is this battle which made me get interested and sit up . There are some very acute observations about the abuse of religion in this movie , and the exploitation of it for ulterior motives , gains , and self-preservation , cannot be highlighted in terms more stark than those here . For money , one can sell the soul to the devil , or turn religious should support be able to be garnered from the support group . For money or power over the masses , false prophets inch their way to top positions so as to have absolute command and control over their followers . To save one's skin , one can deny their Lord whom they exalt in the loudest voice day in day out , although this is no big deal for false prophets since their faith is placed on the moolah instead . I will count my chicken before it hatches , and say Daniel Day-Lewis will win that Best Actor Oscar this year , without a doubt . He will be robbed of that accolade should he not win it , as it was a really fascinating transformation to his character , and I still admire how Day-Lewis the person fades away into the character he portrays . His oil man is nothing but a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing , not even murder , to fulfill his goals . His deep resonating voice is strangely hypnotic , and he presents a character that you will so love to hate , and probably be fearful of , along the way . Relative newcomer Paul Dano holds his own against the acclaimed veteran , and his Eli character exudes a sense of seediness that you can't help but cheer when he gets his just desserts . With the both of them having a chance to have a go at each other , I thought Dano really took up the opportunity to let it rip . It's a pretty long movie , sad to say you can feel its length . It unveils itself very slowly , and the first 20 minutes are pretty much devoid of any speaking parts , as you follow the designing and building of land based oil rigs , as well as the process to bring out the black gold . But there are some brilliant scenes in the movie which are worth their weight in gold , coupled with the beautiful cinematography and art direction , transporting you back to the turn of the century . The last third of the movie seemed to pick up the pace but felt somewhat rushed , but the superb acting and ending more than make up for the shortcomings along the way .
515343	317399	1078188	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Boy	I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently - how convicted criminals , upon release from their jail term , attempt to re-integrate themselves back into society . With Little Children and The Woodsman , we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and non-forgiveness in the community they reside in . But what if this criminal is a killer ? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell , " Boy A " refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor . After serving significant time behind bars , we see him being released from prison , and working with his counsellor Terry ( Peter Mullan ) , he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge ( Andrew Garfield ) . This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background , but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers , or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served . But of course this is no action movie , so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run , with contract killers on the loose . What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig ( Taylor Doherty ) . And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max , where he constantly has to live a lie , and finds it extremely hard to work at , and obtain the trust of others , always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest , and with romance in the picture with Michelle ( Katie Lyons ) , it just complicates things . Fate allows him to redeem himself , but one wonders if that is enough , and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past . Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end , and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together , with the current timeline , and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time . We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality , and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim , but only through a fishing reference , which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime . Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well , being estranged from his wife , and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son . It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack , and how under his care or lackof , would develop inside each boy as the story went along . And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well , especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it , which just makes it a little bit more heart-wrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response , as if pre-emptive , and in the know . So , yellow ribbon project ? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself , and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis . Don't let this gripping drama slip you by , it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll .
515044	317399	1326972	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Red Cliff II	It's been a six month wait for the second and final half to John Woo's magnum opus Red Cliff , and for those familiar with the classic but have not watched the first installment , the director doesn't waste time in bringing you up to speed with an excellent summary , so much so that the transitional technique used was carried over to the main movie proper . And for those who complained about the pigeon soaring over the sky overseeing a football game at the Cao Cao ( Zhang Fengyi ) camp , there're perfect explanations for those too . Yes , just when you think it was frivolous of Woo to have added his signature pigeon shots just for the heck of it , you'll be more than pleased to know that the feathered friends do serve a valid purpose here , as does the football match which introduces a sub plot which again I suspect will give way in the truncated version meant for Western markets . We continue where we last left off , and get to see Vicky Zhao's Sun ShangXiang in an expanded role which is crucial to the overall plotting and strategizing of the finale battle , knocking a bit of the shine off the well known characters of Tony Leung's Zhou Yu and Takeshi Kaneshiro's Zhuge Liang . But don't fret , as there's still ample and well known episodes where the two men get to show off their cunningness and shrewdness in getting their respective one-ups against their common rival . But alas Zhuge Liang gets to become a clear second fiddle here , since he's all brains but absolutely no brawn , and get left out of fisticuffs , putting his firm grasp of mother nature to the test , that the elements also play a fair bit of tipping advantage . Fans of the character though will smile at recognizable anecdotes presented that have given rise to Chinese proverbs . By now , one would already know that Zhou Yu is the primary focus of the show ( I think Chow Yun-Fat is regretting ) , given that he's a well rounded man blessed with brains and brawn , and a beautiful wife to boot too . He's honour and duty bound to protect the southern territory of Sun Quan ( Zhang Chen ) , but this becomes something more personal when Xiao Qiao ( Lin Chiling ) takes it into her own hands to buy the defenders some time by crossing over to Cao Cao and to play the proverbial beauty capable of mesmerizing the prime minister . And her performance in this film was a lot more effective than the last . In fact , the two female characters get meatier roles to play , and for someone like John Woo , I can't remember the last time where he had strong female characters in his films , so this was a treat . Somehow , Red Cliff 2 ended with a whimper unfortunately , which is a pity . The build up is excellent par none , prepping the audience for the big showdown . Those who had lamented the lack of big battle sequences in the first film , well , you can continue to lament as this one only had ONE which takes up almost the last hour . It's execution , pure and simple , putting into motion what has been planned , and the relentless clockwork that every plan had to follow . While the first film had provided for the famed generals of Liu Bei to each have their individual show pieces to highlight their fighting prowess , this one had none as most of the lead characters0 got relegated to support status , except for Zhao Yun ( Hu Jun ) whom John Woo has an affinity for . Fans of Woo's style will see his signature stamped in a lot of action sequences here , which were muted somewhat in the first installment . With Zhao Yun and Zhou Yu , one can tell Woo was probably brimming with glee to design the action set pieces for these two warriors , reminiscent of many of his signature brotherhood series , trading guns for swords here . The two trade barbs of camaraderie , and fight alongside each other , feeding off each other's moves . They battle in parallel , perfectly framed as if in split screen , and I think it's inevitable to have the hero and villain in a stand-off , with support from everyone else wondering who will make the next move . And here's where purists will be up in arms again , because of how the film ended , which went askew from what would have happened , involving both Cao Cao and Guan Yu and that flight of retreat . But I guess if Peter Jackson had some liberties taken , then Woo too should be cut some slack in order to dramatize Red Cliff for the screen . So too would fans of the other characters be upset , because you don't see much of your idols in action here , which mostly got relegated to plenty of pretty fireballs and raging flames on just much everything , and arrows being the weapon of choice for mass destruction here . Individual , stylized fight scenes no longer are the highlight as per the previous film . On the whole it's been a long while since I'd seen an epic of this scale from Chinese cinema , and thank goodness that the rumoured , cringe-worthy lines of dialogue are just that - rumours and nowhere to be found . Come awards time , I'd expect this film to be raking some major accolades . Despite its minute flaws , this is still highly recommended just to complete the saga , and I think I'll get the DVD of both parts should they come in one combined edition .
514895	317399	856008	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sharkwater	Blame it on its many teeth , giving it a perception that it can cut through flesh and bone . And no thanks to movies like Jaws , which has set that perception in stone that sharks are extremely dangerous creatures that have one mission , and that's to eradicate human swimmers from the sea . How do you try and convince what is generally " accepted truths " by the masses ? You go at it small , with persistence , that fire in the belly to fuel your crusade in re-educating the masses , and the best example being yourself taking the plunge to try and set things right , one step at a time . That's what Rob Stewart did , in trying to change the incorrect mindsets we have of sharks , by demonstrating to us how they are actually more afraid of us , and making a documentary film out of it to spread the good message . Don't let the poster fool you into thinking it's a fictional , narrative film . It's a documentary , and like most documentaries , it has an agenda to cover . Here , Stewart's agenda is simple , to talk about shark conservation , and the importance of the ocean ecosystem . Yes , it's a myriad of topics that can spiral out of control , but strangely enough , the key points are all presented in a compelling manner , against very beautiful underwater images of marine life , the very life he is seeking , on the bigger picture , to try and save . Naturally , one doesn't talk about saving the sharks without touching on the demand side of things , and that is the perceived value of a delicacy called the Shark's Fin Soup , which is a staple in any self-respecting Chinese restaurant . While the usual illegal poaching through long lining and footage of skinning are aimed to shock an audience into the cruelty of the way the sharks are destroyed , the biggest impact made here are the frivolous statements given by the chairman of a prominent brand of canned shark's fin soup . You will definitely chuckle at his arguments , or the lack thereof in the intelligence department , as he's made to look quite animated , and not in good light , deliberately of course . Some might feel that the movie did seem a little like an ego-trip for Rob Stewart , with himself being featured quite prominently in many scenes , but I thought it's a given because it is a trip along a journey he's bringing us , and that's why we see some of the inherent risks involved in the many conservationists efforts as they go out to try and stop , with limited budget and resources , the perennial problem of trying to stem out the supply side of things . Naturally , it's never easy with the illegal trade , as shady corporations , characters and corrupt governments are almost always involved , because that's how the activity can thrive , and it boils down to obscene amount of profits to be made by all parties . Through documentaries that touch on current hot topics involving the environment , it's hard to tell how effective they can be . I guess a good measure if how convinced you are to the cause , and from the documentary , try to reinforce the message yourself to your peers . Simple actions done by a few , can go a long way , and I guess the simplest of ways is to start from yourself . An Inconvenient Truth has made me more diligent in electricity utilization , and now Sharkwater has convinced me to layoff the shark's fin soup , whether they come in cans , or presented in wedding dinners . I have a choice , and I choose not to consume it . You might laugh at the futility of my actions , or want to take my share , but go ahead please , as I'm exercising my choice , a choice which you have too . Watch Sharkwater . You might be convinced by the arguments for the cause too . If not , it's still an educational trip in learning more about sharks and the ocean ecosystem , with a stark warning not to tamper with the natural order of Mother Nature . Highly recommended , naturally .
515360	317399	386032	8.0	A Nutshell Review : SiCKO	Won't we like to visit a doctor , and be provided preventive advice during a regular checkup . Or how about instead of worrying just how much those consultation charges are going to be , we get a world class doctor who basically just cares and is genuinely concerned with our well-being , and getting us cured of our sickness ? That's the kind of feeling you get when watching Michael Moore's latest documentary SiCKO . While he rages on and uncovers the deficiencies in the US healthcare system , he waxes lyrical about the free healthcare systems of various countries , while at the same time , comparing how doctors under different systems fare . We all know that doctors make a lot of money , but some make a lot of money because they are specialists and charge sky high fees for their services , that you can't help but wonder if it's money over patients . Then again , in what is termed the socialist medicine model , where doctors are akin to civil servants , being paid a fixed salary with variable components tagged to the welfare of the patients , you wonder too if that is probably a better system altogether , that those genuinely want to heal people , get into the profession , and those who want to make money , well , go work at the pharmaceutical companies . In any case , Moore dresses his documentary up in his usual sexy manner . He again drums up and creates a rally behind his objectives , and it's easy to fall prey to his viewpoint . There are merits to the better models he presented , or how non profit organizations , for the love of healing folks , can come up with 24hr on-call services , truly making healthcare not only affordable , but within physical reach . And he contrasts this with the cold , calculated way in which Americans are treated . And there's the flaw with privatizing healthcare , leaving it into the hands of , god forbid , insurance companies . It's almost common sense that premiums are always easy to pay , provided you satisfy many of the pre-conditions , but when it comes to the claim , that's where the real problem starts , as you'd come to expect delays , challenges , combing the fine print for some ambiguous clause just to starve you off any legitimate payback . I seriously hope we don't get our monies trapped in such schemes ( ahem , annuities ? ) . And when we're talking about life and death , it's ideal to leave little room for contracts and negotiations - life takes priority . In that sense where security and education comes into play , we leave it to the powers that be , and shouldn't healthcare be so as well ? Short of labelling it as the restriction of freedom and choice as some would have it argued , it actually comes with widespread social acceptance , and of course , taxes . You must be willing to pay to receive subsidized , or even free benefits . Otherwise , where do all these funds come from ? And this is where Moore conveniently skips , or mentions in extremely brief passing . There's no such thing as a free lunch , though neither is it a zero sum game , and there will be two sides carved out - those who just want to enjoy the benefits without contributing to it , and those who resent paying for someone else's welfare . Not everyone can be like the Canadians : ) Different strokes for different folks , depending on which set of values one subscribes to . So as Moore uncovers ideal benefits in the healthcare systems in the UK , France , Canada and even Cuba , he doesn't address the other social ills and resentment that comes along with it . But of course , since this is a documentary , and naturally the points that make the final cut must all support the filmmaker's vision . If compared to his earlier works , SiCKO comes across as more mature though , with its sexy arguments made against a very serious presentation and tone , void of all the quirky animations , and have rather limited snark remarks , not that they're not present . But the best bits about it , is how he pieces together the corruption in the whole system , including those in seats of power . As we know , some politicians can be persuaded with funds to assist in their respective lobbies , and it is no surprise where these healthcare insurance companies put their money on . Politicians on payrolls , in a nice way , are nothing new . And seriously , nobody can fault a private enterprise into achieving its prime objective in a market economy , and that is to maximize profits . Money can be used to cover the heart and soul , so why not use it to an advantage . SiCKO is crafted shrewdly in the hands of Moore , and frankly , brought its points out rather well . The much anticipated Guantanamo Bay excursion though was much ado about nothing , given the widespread publicity of the potential trouble Moore might get into . But the real gem of the movie though , is the lesson on how to shape one's arguments - place incessant focus on the good parts to debunk what currently doesn't work , because the bigger picture will always be able to puncture arguments presented within a 2 hour picture . It's never easy to find a right balance for any social issue , or life for that matter . I just have to make sure , as I told a friend , that I have a plan on what to do if I'm diagnosed with a serious condition , given rising health care costs here as well . And by the looks of it increasing in time to come , the plan definitely includes the reluctance to line the coffers of the doc treating me .
514728	317399	366777	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Millions	Director Danny Boyle is known for his stylish films in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later . While the latter talks about the evil of drugs , Millions talks about the root of all evil - Money . Lots of it . To be exact , close to 300 British pounds . This film is about taking and using money that is not yours , the morality behind that issue , and the exploration if sudden wealth can change a person's attitude . It also looks at spending large amounts of money ( and the difficulty thereof ) in a short span of time , as this film is set against a backdrop of the British Pound no longer being legal tender after 7 days , given the British's decision to use the Eurodollar . Damian Cunningham is a young boy who's missing his mother , who just passed away , and whom we don't get to see until the end of the film ( in a very touching scene ) . He has been living in his own imaginary world since , reading about and dreaming about talking to Saints , asking them if they had met or known about his mom in heaven . Many times , we look at this world through the eyes of this innocent boy , especially when the huge sack of money literally fell onto him , and he thinks that it is a gift from God as compensation for taking his mom . And that's when the story picks up . His brother Anthony suggested they keep quiet about the finding - reason being the government will tax most of it away , and while Anthony decides to ham it up , using the money to buy friends and cronies , Damian developed a want to help the poor - from people in the street , to Mormons ( the punching bag for some major gags in the film , and the hypocrisy of it all ) , to Africans in need of food , water and shelter , and absolute strangers , which is of course , dangerous when the " real owner " of the bag of money come knocking at the door . Given the dilemma of spending , how do you want to do it ? Invest in real estate ? Foreign Exchange ? ( The savvy Anthony came up with those suggestions , and seeing it on screen is hilarious ) . Save it in a bank ? And given your want to help others , how do you do so without endangering yourself , which Damian However , when you realise that the money is not Godsent , but robbed while en route to the incinerator ( one of the many interesting scenes in this film is the heist ) , what do you do next ? Do you continue spending it ? Or give it up ? Do you spend the money as a form of compensation for your house getting ransacked by burglars looking for the loot ? Damian Cunningham is played by Alexander Etel , and you can't help think he's the British's answer to McCauley Culkin at his age . He brings forth pure innocence as Damian , and is absolutely hilarious in his dealings with his imaginary Saints ( complete with halos ) . And the saints go marching on - the highlight of which is St Peter . Listen carefully to the dialogue , as he makes subtle digs into parables and the truth behind a certain miracle - I cracked up at that one . This film isn't complete without the complementary baddie and the uptight community policeman , and also gives the term social engineering a whole new perspective ( even practised by the young ! ) . With Danny Boyle's stylistic editing and beautiful shots of transitions and imaginary situations to complement the social commentary , this could probably be in contention as one of the best films of 2005 .
515025	317399	427944	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Thank You for Smoking	I was attracted to the movie because of its title - Thank You for Smoking . It's not politically correct - where's the " not " ? And the trailer looked like it was a whole lot of fun as well , with a tobacco evangelist spreading the good news about smoking and cigarettes . Coincidentally , this movie also turned out to be this week's GV Surprise Screening selection . I like movies with ensemble cast too , and this one consisted of Aaron Eckhart , Maria Bello , Sam Elliot , Rob Lowe , William H Macy , JK Simmons , Robert Duvall , Katie Holmes and Cameron Bright . Not the usual big names , but a stellar cast nonetheless , some of whom you would've come across in other big budgeted movies , like JK Simmons - the James Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spidey , or Cameron Bright - the most over-under utilized kid from Ultraviolet and X3 . The opening credits played to the song " Smoke , Smoke , Smoke that Cigarette ! " , consisting of colourful cigarette boxes , already got me hooked , and the protagonist of Nick Naylor ( Eckhart ) , the tobacco industry lobbyist , is one heck of an interesting character , and holds one heck of a dream job . He's not a lawyer , but can sure talk like one , and has the same uncanny ability to turn black into white with his wit and persuasion . There are plenty of witty lines and dialogue in this movie , played out with some cheese and infused with comedy at the right moments . My favourite moments are those in which Nick teaches his son Joey ( Bright ) how to win arguments , which he's the best at the business at . About the flawed but sounds-so-sexily correct logic which is employed to break down the arguments of another . He has few friends , since anti-smoking lobbyists are a dime a dozen , and counts amongst his circle of trust , the Mod Squad , consisting of fellow spin doctors from the Alcohol and Firearms industry ( Maria Bello and David Koechner respectively ) . Their chill out get together dinner sessions are a hoot to watch , as they go about sharing ideas , spinning techniques , and rant about their collective enemies . If there's a lesson to take away from this picture , it's not to sleep and tell , especially if the reporter has glorious tits , in the mould of Katie Holmes . Bent on exposing the slickest in the business , you thought that Nick would be beaten down with a scandal . But as they say , it's always tough to keep a good man down ! Besides the romantic entanglement , there's a little sub plot about office politics , like having a " leaning mountain " in the form of your boss's boss , and the trouble that will inevitably knock on your door when he's no longer around . Compelling stuff . In a movie which seemed to be pro-tobacco , you'd be surprised that NONE of the characters actually light up on screen ! The closest we got to was from a movie " Sands of Iwo Jima " shown on television , but he got shot when he was distributing ciggies to his mates . How's that for irony ? And I have no idea why the local rating is M18 for sexual references . Sure there was sex , but you can't see a thing , and it got truncated badly anyway . Why can't the censors get straight to the point that it's M18 - Pro-Cigarette movie , which would align with local laws that cigarettes cannot be sold to those under 18 years of age ? One wonders . Then again , as addressed in the movie , I liked the part where there was a commotion over the effectiveness of having horrible pictures of death printed on the cigarette boxes . You must watch and see if you agree with the arguments presented . But the bottom line is , it's all about choice . Everyone , unless you're extremely ignorant , should already be aware of the dangers . If you want to , go ahead . If not , that's fine too . Now where's my cigarette ? ( should I , too , stick an M18 warning or attach some grotesque pictures ? : P )
515357	317399	829482	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Superbad	Superbad is Supergood ! Many have been lauding high accolades on this teen comedy to be the best thing since American Pie , and guess what , it's true ! Before you roll your eyes at yet another teenage and / or sex comedy , with desperate nerds hatching diabolical plans to get laid , Superbad comes across as a breath of fresh air really , given that it has a cast of unknowns , thus free of any expectations to deliver , which thankfully it does . What it doesn't have in raunchy sex scenes , it more than makes up for with its trash talking , especially from loud mouthed Seth ( Jonah Hill ) , who has possibly the best lines in the movie , though coming close to a scene stealer is Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Foggell aka McLovin with his uber-nerdish demeanour . Together with Evan ( Michael Cera ) , the trio play best friends who , being nerds , have only one another to hang out with , until they get themselves invited to a party only through providing the false hope that they can deliver the booze . And the trio branches off into two story arcs before converging for the finale , when Seth and Evan left Fogell to fend for himself when the latter goes for the jugular at a booze shop . It's difficult to judge which of the two arcs was funnier , though I'd go for Fogell / McLovin's as it had the inclusion of two zany beat cops played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen ( from Knocked Up ) , and it has some of the most insane scenes with the antics that these two cops can conjure . Seth and Evan's storyline however centered more on the dramatic aspects of two friends facing the prospect of separation after graduation , and leaned extremely close to homo-eroticism at certain points . But I digress , it did have a definite hilarious scene in a party they gatecrash , which involves , what else , bodily fluids in the most unexpected of manners . But it's not as vulgar as you think it is , save for gratuitous pictures of the penis in all shapes , sizes , forms , with a limit only the imagination can put a finger ( heh ) to . It's akin to oral sex - that is , the extremely rapid fire use of the F-word - with attempts at actual horizontal action constantly doused with cold water . The gems are in the dialogue and in both Jonah Hill's and Christopher Mintz-Plasse's fleshing of their characters . To top it off , it actually had quite a coherent story , and an ending which you can read either way , and it'll still work . Fused with plenty of physical humour , crass dialogue and plenty of rude pictures ( stay while the credits roll ) , Superbad will definitely bring out the guffaws , one way or another . Oh , and watch out for that super-retro opening credits too !
514513	317399	445620	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Paradise Now	Paradise Now was the Palestinian film which won the Golden Globes this year for best foreign language film , and it's no wonder to see why it did . Touching on very real , contemporary and the sensitive issue about the relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians , it takes on the much talked about and feared weapon of terrorists / freedom fighters , that of the suicide bomber . And for that , I applaud the movie's take and narrative , which treads the very fine line and provides the audience aspects from both ends of the spectrum . The introduction is nicely set up , that the Israelis view the Palestinians with suspicious eyes , while it is the case of contempt the other way around . It doesn't set out to glamorize dastardly deeds , but presents a more intimate look into the making of a martyr , the motivations behind those who have willed themselves to political suicide , as well as presenting arguments for a more peaceful resolution through negotiations . Said ( Kais Nashef ) and Khaled ( Ali Suliman ) are childhood friends living in the city of Nablus . They're essentially the working class , and on the surface , your average Joe with non extremist views , living in a city where explosions are common everyday events . But before you know it , it's revealed that they are freedom fighters living a life of normalcy , and beneath the happy-go-lucky facade , they're ever ready to die for their cause . This movie humanizes the anonymous faces we often see in the news , thereby drawing flak from certain circles . A chance presents itself , and the two of them are assigned to an unnamed group's latest and largest operation in 2 years , a bombing in Tel Aviv . Here's where things are interesting , as rituals are presented as the duo prepare themselves for their appointment with Paradise . And this movie doesn't hold back in making fun of precisely this sacred promise of going to Heaven after the violent act of murder is committed . Watching it being presented through dialog by their chief operative , makes you wonder how gullible and easily manipulated would-be martyrs can be . But just as you're ready to generalize the simplistic behavior of suicide bombers , the movie's third act will arrest you with a twist that deeply explores the agendas , personal vendettas and the likes , which transcend all reasons and logic , providing more than enough fuel for motivation . Worry not though that the movie will be heavy in theme . There are adequate light hearted moments to break the seriousness , and interesting visual details like the handless bomb - maker , puts things into certain perspective . Or that tongue-in-cheek reference to The Last Supper as well . The ending was superb . My guess is many weaned on Hollywood will not come to appreciate it as it yanks the carpet from under your feet . Those who are accustomed to big , loud explosions might find it puzzling . But I thought it was a brilliant way to end it , a silent purposeful statement that continues throughout the end credits , stripping away any glamor of violence , whatever the cause , reason or rationale used to justify it . Paradise Now is a film rooted in realism despite its fictional storyline . It is without the usual glitz associated with recent films touching on the subject ( Syrianna comes to mind ) and makes perfect use of its smaller scale to tell a more intimate , but no less powerful , story .
514652	317399	428803	9.0	A Nutshell Review : March of the Emperor	This film is a celebration of life , love , danger and death , as seen through the eyes of Emperor Penguins in the Antarctica . Most people will come to know of this documentary from its quiet successful ascension on the American Box Office . For those who do not want to know the story , you may skip this part SPOILERS START We follow the penguins in their annual ritual in making life , beginning with long marches on ice to their mating ground . There , there look for their partners , and begin their " one night stand " . The eggs are laid , and the moms go off to gather food their future chicks , while the dads stay behind to look after the eggs and shield them from the cold . When the chicks hatch , the moms will have returned , and begin their feeding , while it's dads turn to go fish . It's like an interchanging of roles between mom and dad in taking care of the little one , until such time when they've grown and can hit the ocean waters to begin their own life . SPOILERS END 3 different narrators tell the story from different perspectives - the father , mother and child , Peppered throughout and assisting the narrative are the English songs ( in a French movie , which seemed a bit odd ) , and the stunning cinematography will leave many speechless . You will ponder at the wonders of nature and life itself , with these penguins undergoing their rituals and knowing exactly what to do during certain times . Instinct ? Probably . The theme of Danger and Death lurks at every corner , ever ready to pounce . As in the movie , you'll never know when to expect when Death strikes , though most of the violence happen off screen , and probably not as violent as what you can view on the Discovery Channel . It's a refreshing change to watch a documentary during this busy August and fall in love with the penguin chicks . I know many in the audience did .
515483	317399	337978	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Die Hard 4 . 0	John McClane , USA's supercop , returns to the big screens . being at the wrong place at the wrong time yet again , kicking some major terrorists ass since the original Die Hard way back in 1988 . It has been almost 12 years since Bruce Willis last starred in the definitive cop role , which some would arguably state that Die Hard had kick started the action movie blockbusters in the late 80s to 90s . I was just a 12 year old kid when I watched the original Die Hard , with a bruised and battered McClane surviving on gut instinct and an incredible amount of sly wit to turn the tables on the bad guys despite being heavily outnumbered . And with a building not big enough as his playground , Die Hard 2 saw him move up a level to weave in and out of an airport . Samuel L Jackson tag teams Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance , where they run around NY City playing Simon Says , and now , McClane has to take on a group of multi-nationality mercenary geeks who threaten the entire USofA . The playground keeps getting bigger , but that's only befitting a supercop , ain't it . both in threat level and geography . Mark Bomback's story in Live Free or Die Hard continues to paint a picture of woe for McClane . You'd expect a supercop like himself to be highly decorated , rewarded , commended etc , but as it turns out , he's painfully divorced , has almost nothing except for the shirt on his back , his daughter Lucy , played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead , ( Death Proof , Final Destination 3 ) refuses to acknowledge him , and nothing could be worst than an escorting mission right out of 16 Blocks , right ? And that's where he gets into the wrong place at the wrong time , getting back to the formula . In fetching an easily impressed geek hacker Matt Farrell ( Justin Long ) , he finds himself in the thick of the plot to bring down the national infrastructure in a coordinated takeover using a Fire Sale methodology which Farrell unwittingly contributed , and it's up to the duo to save USA , especially when the old school cop obviously had his inadequacy and disdain for technology show , sometimes leading to comedy . While most of the action sequences have been shown in the trailers , and while they might look like your usual car chases , explosions and gun battles , somehow there is still a " die hard " feel to them all . Perhaps this can be attributed to formula again , and some familiarity of " have we seen this before " ( aka the lift shaft sequence ) , only to have them being updated for today , and of course , being a little faster , a little more furious , than our aging hero could handle . There's a scene which might make some scream " True Lies ! " , and Maggie Q unfortunately is a tad overrated , relegated into a typical role that if it's Asian , then there must be some kung-fu involved . And speaking of the bad guys , the Die Hard franchise have always featured foreign subversive elements , like Euro terrorist Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman ) in Die Hard , and his brother Simon Gruber ( Jeremy Irons ) wanting to avenge Hans in Die Hard With a Vengeance , while some General in a fictional country made McClane Die Harder . The trend continues here , especially with the employment of Frenchmen who can do Parkour . The motivation , save for Die Harder , has always been the same - Money . The bad guys of course never learn from history , and repeat the same mistakes . In this one , while they seem a little smug with themselves , actually work with less loyalty than those in the other movies . Timothy Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel comes from within , out to prove a point as a disgruntled ex-government employee , Obviously Thomas has no respect for history , and although he has access to records , is quite oblivious to know who he's messing with , and repeating the same mistake as Hans Gruber did in taking a family member hostage . Despite some similarities in plot development in the hopes of stalling McClane , the formula too extended to things like McClane making contact with the bad guys without actually seeing each other in the flesh . That bit though contributed to a kink in the production , with a somewhat major error in having the walkie talkie seem like a working telephone , and bad editing made mouth movement out of sync . There are other loopholes , or some would deem ridiculous , preposterous or impossible sequences ( just like how I say Die Hard With a Vengeance had this scene where Willis and Jackson slam onto containers , and yet survive ) , but hey , so long as McClane gets to kick some arse in a satisfactory manner , without mercy and almost always with a quip , I'm not complaining . Die Hard 4 . 0 is indeed another hurrah for John McClane . Willis has played other cop roles like in Hostage , Sin City , Mercury Rising , 16 Blocks and the likes , but none of them are as memorable nor as definitive as McClane . Of late there is a return of old school heroes like Rambo and Rocky teaching their contemporary peers just how to stamp their mark in action flicks , and there absolutely is no doubt on McClane's successful return . Yippee-Ki-Yay indeed !
515089	317399	914798	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Boy in Striped Pyjamas	At the risk of sounding stupid , while I knew that this was based on a book by John Boyne , not having read it meant I had initially thought that it would be one of those childhood based film on fantasy . And I guess so did many parents in bringing their little tykes in what they thought would be a weekend filler in between activities . Little did I and they know of course that it packed such a powerful emotional punch in not wanting to be just another movie set in WWII Germany and the Holocaust , showcasing the horror of that era seen through the eyes of a little boy who couldn't understand the gravity of the dire situation he's plunged into , making it all the more painful to bear witness to . I was glad that director Mark Herman didn't dumb it down for the audience in masking the horror of the atrocities committed , as are the cover ups and the matter of fact manner in which the Nazis went about conducting their persecution of the Jews in concentration camps . Asa Butterfield stars as Bruno , an eight year old boy from whose eyes we witness the chain of events unfold . Having the family uprooted from Berlin to the countryside in order to follow the father ( played by David Thewlis ) , an officer in Hitler's army , we soon realize the true nature of this assignment , and that's to oversee the activity of building horrendous gas chambers and managing a concentration camp that's just a stone's throw away from their family mansion . To Bruno , being in a new environment means a severe lack of friends his age , and from his room he spies a farm where farmers mill around in their pyjamas . We see the world through the eyes of an impressionable , innocent boy who has yet to be exposed to the evil of the world , and this presents itself a number of avenues for the corruption of his mind , starting with the family home tutor indoctrinating Bruno and his sister Gretel ( Amber Beattie ) in lies against humanity . However , Bruno's sense for exploration and adventure sees him sneak out of his house and toward the " farm " , where he finds a boy his age Shmeul ( Jack Scanlon ) across the other side of the fence whom he befriends . This sets up some major conflict within Bruno especially when what he's being taught , told and observed within the household , being in direct conflict with his first hand experience with Scmuel , and becomes totally confused , though still afraid of speaking up for obvious reasons . This theme of standing up for what's right ( or the lack thereof ) and betrayal of the highest order has been explored in similar vein in films such as The Kite Runner and The Reader , but it doesn't mean that this film had its thunder well taken away from it . It still resonates thanks to the excellent portrayals by the kids in roles where their innocence has no place in their world gone mad , having rationale folks like the Mother ( Vera Farmiga ) shouted down and out . James Horner gives this film a wonderful score , and became a character on its own highlighting the various dangers lurking beneath the seemingly happier notes . Such as a scene where a screening of what goes on inside the camps was made , but totally for propaganda purposes , in stark contrast to what we know would and had happened , but here fabricated for the mass public . To Bruno , it seemed like his dad is a national hero , though there's this sense of karmic retribution permeating and waiting on the wings to pounce . We also see how double standards can be applied within family , and a general culture of fear being bred no thanks to the Oath that each officer had to undertake . Despite the dark content , the film is beautifully lensed , and I haven't read any qualm about the actors here all having to adopt an English accent ( in contrast with the stark complaints with Valkyrie , which is much ado about nothing ) . The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an extremely moving piece and I had to admit I was quite affected by it , especially when the final reel came rolling . The last time I was this affected and moved by a " children's " movie was The Bridge to Terabithia . This film firmly joins it in that list of surprises , and a natural contender in my shortlist for the top movies of the year . Highly recommended !
515278	317399	1271985	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Shi Qi	Watching the movies in the festival to date , it's quite amazing how the first or early films of the directors in attendance are of immense quality , and whilst Joe Chow may be the youngest in the country currently , his Shi Qi definitely stood out as if it was a movie made by an assured veteran at the helm . Set amongst the She minority tribe , this film is essentially a mother and son story which I felt I haven't seen much of ( usually father-son ) , and with the casting of Joan Chen , it's no doubt that her star factor would have helped piqued curiosity about this film . At its core , it's about the said relationship between titular character Shi Qi ( Sam Chow ) who at the onset we see is at odds with his mother's perhaps stifling upbringing , and one made complicated by Shi Qi being abandoned to foster parents when he was a toddler , and reclaimed by Mom when he was 10 . To add fuel to the resentment , his foster parents have adopted his childhood friend Tian Yi ( Vision Wei ) instead , and watching him grow up with opportunities that could've been his own , just leaves a bad taste as he's stuck rooted in the village by Mom , and can't express his frustrations other than to rely on his talent for woodcarving . Sam Chow breathes inner frustration in his role as the teenager yearning to see the world outside , and the deep profound unhappiness he festers toward his Mom . It's easy for teenagers to identify with this , given the living under the thumb and watchful eyes of a parent whom you know you're the center of the world to her . And when parents get in the way and in the process causing you to miss opportunities , you'd sure would raise a ruckus . So while living a sheltered life , Shi Qi decides to leave the village , even though he doesn't exactly know how . What shone in the movie is the getting down to basics instead of trying to bite off more than it can chew , and through that sincere exploration of the relationship between mother and son , you're likely to see some parallels perhaps that would ring a bell on your own , at how sometimes we hurt the ones we love most without even realizing it . For the mom , her taking care of her son would seem to mean having him always by her side , though understood that she has lost him once , and would pain her if it happened again , thus her desperation in holding him back through some really adorable , and unworkable antics . And to the son fast growing up , his lack of acknowledgement toward his mom's good intentions , and his frequent brushing of her aside , would touch the hearts and make one feel guilty if one had done this insensitive act from time to time . Joe Chow managed to bring out the anxieties of both characters in their road trip on foot over a period of two days , where they had to trek the picturesque mountainous road from village to the nearest town where the city bus plies . Along the way , this reaching out and connection come to a role play of sorts , with each character taking turns to lead , or to try and turn the tables on each other , finding something to connect , or to bridge an understanding . The movie relied tremendously on the chemistry between the two actors to pull this off , and they were excellent par none . The score was hauntingly beautiful , and the film also captured the seldom heard , and dying art of the She tribe songs and music , which added a documentary like dimension to the film . Audiences here would likely be familiar with Joan Chen , especially when she had graced the screen in a number of local releases . Despite similar mother roles in movies such as The Leap Years , Home Song Stories and even Saving Face which I enjoyed , she brings to the table different qualities in those motherly roles , but I dare say her performance in Shi Qi ranked the best amongst all . She truly brought out the adage that a mother's love knows no bounds , and I guess without a doubt , you'll see a lot of the general motherhood qualities here put under the spotlight , that will make you think through some of the things you would have taken for granted . Not to mention too the amount of nuances she put in the role , that would likely demand a repeat viewing ( I smiled ear to ear when she quickly put her fingers to her ear when they retracted after touching a hot pot ) . While it's a small movie in the sense that it doesn't have big set sequences , it's nonetheless one that packs a powerful emotional punch , and captured plenty of heartfelt emotions and sincerity in its story , that it is difficult not to fall in love with it as well .
515407	317399	112913	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Fallen Angels	I've got a strange affinity with Wong Kar-wai's movies , and they seem to somehow present themselves in reverse order to me , where often I find myself visiting his earlier works backwards . Like watching 2046 first before In the Mood for Love , or right now , watching Fallen Angels before Chungking Express , where I have both movies on DVDs sitting on the shelves , but decide to pick Angels before Chungking , knowing jolly well that this one came after , and was like the film that expanded itself so much that it had to break away and stand alone on its own two feet . Deciding between Chungking Express and Fallen Angels also boiled down to pure laziness on my part to want to pop a Region Free DVD into my default player , hence the latter . And I can't help but to chuckle at how Leon Lai's killer character Wong Chi Ming paralleled this laziness of mine , in wanting things on a sliver platter , of getting the preparation work all set out for him , and he just enters the scene with his swagger as the executioner . And the woman behind him acting as his agent and cleaning lady , is played by Michelle Reis . As his agent , she gets the contracts , does the legwork to draw up plans , and with time as she hangs out at his apartment to clean it up , she nurses an aching heart , knowing that perhaps in their profession , to fall in love would spell doom . And it doesn't take one too long to identify with such longing , of being so near yet so far , and she exorcises her unrequited passion by either visiting the places he visits just to hang on to his lingering presence long after he's gone , or by pleasuring herself on his bed . Kinda kinky , don't you think ? While Chungking Express dealt with the relationship issues that two cops had to experience ( from my fuzzy knowledge of it anyway ) , Fallen Angels seemed to be its evil twin , again dealing with relations of the heart , but now from the viewpoints centered on two criminals , one in Lai's character , and here the other in Takeshi Kaneshiro ( who was also in Chungking Express ) with his mute He Zhiwu , who breaks into shops and plays plenty of make belief . In his story arc , his unrequited love stems from his chance encounter with Charlie Young's Charlie , who too suffers a broken heart , but goes over the bend . In fact , I would have thought that Eating Air took a huge leaf out of certain aspects of their courtship , especially with the lovers on a bike careening through Hong Kong's underground highways . And Charlie Young I thought did substantially more than the flower vase roles she's more famous for perfecting . While Zhiwu can't speak , it is perhaps this arc that has a lot to say about love in classic WKW pathos . We listen in to the thoughts of Zhiwu as he narrates them in Mandarin voiceovers , such as topics of relationships having their expiration date , and the keeping of someone's memory alive . With Chi-Ming , he consciously rejects someone who takes an extreme liking of him , to go for a random , temporary lover in the form of Karen Mok's Blondie , who again might be another throwback to a similar character back in Chungking Express . But being cautionary here , is yet again the tale of not incurring the wrath of the wrong woman , though I chose to interpret the events in his story thereafter as being one of a set up , or a fix , versus just being a case of coincidental bad luck . And you cannot get away with not talking about frequent WKW collaborator Christopher Doyle's cinematography in this film , with its obtuse angles like a fish eye twitching all around with plenty of kinetic energy , boasting of shots within shots with its use of captured mirror images . Time lapse also gets used quite frequently , giving it a sense of broad fast forwarding motion , with the devil in the details treated quite casually . With a variation of Massive Attack's Karma Coma by Roel Garcia featured in an eclectic soundtrack , it already bowled me over with its collection of songs featured , whereLove stories that don't go anywhere except to serve as personal reminders , familiar pathos as presented by WKW , a star studded cast and excellent visuals and music , easily make this film one of my firm favourites . I suppose I shouldn't waste too much time before embarking on my journey onboard the more illustrious Chungking Express .
515404	317399	353969	10.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Memories of Murder	I've always taken a liking for serial-killer crime thrillers such as Se7en or the more recent Zodiac , because the cat-and-mouse game between the killer and the cops never seem to tire out , at least for me , and especially so if they're based on real life incidents which add a sense of realism in the stories that are told . It can be wavered off as implausible , because there were real victims who fell under the cunning of the killer . Korean crime thrillers have so far been a mixed bag though , even if those like Voice of a Murderer were based on unsolved true incidents , because in the hands of less able directors , it's always easy to lapse into laziness in making the film , applying quite standard narrative types involving chronology , and what happens next , or over dramatizing elements of the story just to amplify emotions of pity and anger , or worse yet , become a bland whack-fest , hyping on gruesomeness and gore as spectacle . And here's where director Bong Joon-ho , who went on to make the superb The Host , excelled , in sailing with an even keel in the presentation of Memories of Murder , making it extremely memorable , and went beyond your standard crime thriller fare by deftly gelling together all elements in the movie , into one keenly felt film . Memories of Murder recounts possibly South Korea's first serial killer , who went on a spree between 1986 and 1991 with 10 women brutally raped and murdered , and sparked off an intense investigations which involved some 1 . 8 million cops and 3000 suspects , as the prologue would have us believe . Song Kang-ho stars as Detective Park Doo-man , a small town cop with little experience in investigations of such nature , and it's slowly revealed too that the police of those days possess very rudimentary skills and equipment to handle crime of such nature , coupled with the complexity of having to deal with curious villagers and onlookers who contaminate each crime scene . In comes Detective Seo Tae-yoon ( Kim Sang-kyung ) from Seoul who volunteered for this assignment , and you have your big city versus small town rivalry , as the two of them can't see eye to eye in various matters , especially when it boiled down to extracting confessions of convenience from prime suspects , in order to wrap up the case and call it a day , dished out from in your face beatings by Park's sidekick Kim Roe-ha ( Cho Yong Koo ) . Under a social and historical backdrop of martial law , we see how questionable methods get employed , and how sloppy investigations can get , at times relying on questionable and unorthodox methods involving torture . It is this constant interplay of opposites that keep the viewing engaged throughout , especially with the incessant challenging of individual cop's beliefs and investigative philosophies , which at times can dwell on black humour , such as the profiling of hairless men . All the lead cops in the movie no doubt will grow and come out of this experience changed , such as how small time cop gets forced to open his mind and widen his horizon , and how the constant frustration at being hit with red herring after red herring , of being so close but yet so bloody far , just adds on to the complexity of the case that this is not your simple criminal , but a cold and calculated serial one . There are a couple of elements that I particularly enjoyed in the film , such as how opposites almost always bring about a clash , be it of values or methods employed , in particular how Detectives Park and Seo come to blows , one a believer of his own sixth sense ability , while the other a follower of paper and documentation . Director Bong also crafted an element of comparison between the macho cops and a rather soft prime suspect , one you would probably not have put on your radar , who just appears , and I couldn't help but to draw comparisons with David Fincher's famous Se7en and Zodiac , which were made before and after this one , where it is fairly clear of certain similarities between this film and Se7en with its incessant rainy setup , while Zodiac shares the same frustration with this one in the cops ' inability and impotence of not being able to crack the case in front of them , resulting in an increase in body count . Nothing beats having to know the MO , but being powerless to do something about it . Best of all , Bong Joon-ho knows how to craft a thriller with action at the right moments , and they need no be big-bang types , but sequences which were highly effective in bringing out adrenaline . He did that for this film , and for The Host , and without a doubt I begin to feel that he understands the material at hand in order to craft them for the pleasure of an audience sitting through it . I still have one more of his earlier movies on DVD format yet to be watched , and I hope to pop that into the player once I savor this masterpiece once more . Highly recommended , and it sits in my mental list of great serial killer crime films .
514921	317399	290002	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Meet The Fockers	If this is a comedy year , then it's gotta be Ben Stiller's year , with films like Starsky and Hutch , Dodgeball , and now , a sequel to the hit Meet The Parents . It's a logical move , given the success to the movie , and a natural continuation to meeting the other set of parents , what more one whose family name sounds so much like an expletive . The film wastes no time in reminding you why the first was successful , with obvious jabs on the male nursing profession and his Gaylord M Focker name . The first 5 minutes sums up everything you liked about the first film nicely - " I'm Watching You " hand gestures , circle of trust , etc , before embarking on the inane journey to Focker Isle , where things get , a little crazier . Our favourite characters like the kitty cat are back , and joined with another madcap hump-everything-that-moves doggie . In addition , we have a baby on board who adds a new dimension to innocence . Although some plot bits are recycled from the first , like the use of hidden cameras by De Niro , and then playbacked for hilarious effect during the end credits , none of it seems contrived and you just wanna sit through and lap all of it up . Definite must see this holiday season .
514702	317399	910970	10.0	A Nutshell Review :	In some strange twist of Fate , the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens , while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out . It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays , but frankly , the money also comes from the adult crowd , as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow . And I may sound like a broken record , but Pixar has done it again . Quality stories with quality animation , and it kept the run time to a manageable under 100 minutes , compared to the previous offering Ratatouille , which clocked near 120 minutes ( or actually felt that long ) . I never expected WALL¬∑E to pack in such a strong emotional punch , not that Pixar has never animated non-living objects before ( such as Cars ) , but there's a certain child like innocence appeal that WALL¬∑E possesses , that makes him very charming , and very endearing to the audience . As a Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class , Isaac Asimov's Robot directives has him firmly and dutifully carrying out his duties of compacting Earth's rubbish , as the last of its class on Earth to clean up the mess . Humans have now polluted the world so much that they took to Space in Star Trek inspired ship designs , to live out there while WALL¬∑Es take over to do some massive spring cleaning . Until of course , our WALL¬∑E becomes like The Last Man , erm , Robot on Earth with a cockroach companion , acting and emoting superbly that puts Will Smith to shame . The fantastic thing about WALL¬∑E is that it can tell so much by so little . The first few minutes establish everything we need to know about the current world , and paints a very humanistic , soulful value to the dusty , dirty and rickety robot . He ( see what I mean ? ) has a lot of eccentricities , and in performing his duties , develops quirks and becomes a collector ( of junk ) of sorts , which allows the creators to pump in plenty of sight gags and inside jokes ranging from sound effects ( I swear my Apple is now a WALL¬∑E pre-cursor ) to paying homage to movies such as 2001 : A Space Odessey . In essence , WALL¬∑E is a love story in human terms , where the boy tries hard to get the girl , only to have her spurn his advances . EVE ( which stands for Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator ) is WALL¬∑E's object of affection , who got sent to Earth as a probe for life . And my , she's a difficult one to handle , being state of the art , as well as packing a mean self-defense mechanism that makes breaking the ice really difficult . Not to mention as well , a fiery temper to boot . Which means our guy has to really try , and try hard , to break that wall down . Poor thing really , because all he wanted to do , was to hold her hand . The Beatles would have been proud . But of course you'll have to throw in tougher adversary and events to make it all the more worthwhile in WALL¬∑E's pursuit of EVE , which spans lightyears and a plant that becomes the catalyst for their romance . A lot of the movie takes place on board The Axiom , the human ship where a vision of the future is presented , which metaphorically holds a mirror up to ourselves in our over reliance in technology that we're beginning to grow sideways , and not noticing the things that nature has in store for us , human to human communication , and the things that matter . It also has an soft environmental message and stance thrown in , but done so subtly that you wouldn't feel that it's being preachy and a turn off . I hate to admit it too that the movie turned me into a big softie , especially its clich√©d finale , where you know what will happen , but yet want to second guess if the filmmakers could be so heartless with an ending that I thought would really make me shed a tear . However , it's Disney after all , and when you think of merchandise opportunities , then business sense prevails . WALL¬∑E deserves every acclaim that it's got , and let me contribute mine too . If you have time to only watch one animated movie this year , or want to bring your kids to one , then make no mistake , WALL¬∑E is the perfect choice , without a doubt , hands down . It makes it to my books as contender for the top 10 movies of the year . Highly recommended stuff , and the leads don't even speak much save to call out to each other ! Oh , do put your bum on the seat early too , as with all Pixar features , there's always a short that preluded it , and Presto is nothing short of hilarious , and a crowd pleaser to rouse the audience into a frenzy before the main act takes over . I guess it's high time I purchase the collection of Pixar shorts available on DVD as well .
515118	317399	942385	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Tropic Thunder	First of all , the goodies begin even before the main movie starts proper , with some hilarious fake ads and trailers just like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse features which fabricated some material of its own , so don't be a dweeb and be late for the movie . Now that the public service reminder is out of the way , Tropic Thunder managed to live up to its hype , which in my personal opinion is a bit difficult these days because the marketing folks usually put the best bits in the trailers so that there's no more surprises left , or that the narrative actually fizzles out into mediocrity , losing steam halfway through the movie . Thankfully , this movie managed to pace and therefore sustain itself right through to the ending . There were a couple of plus points in the movie that made it rewarding to sit through . First of all , the movie satirizes almost everything that makes up the Hollywood film industry , with some keen poking of fun from the actors to the crew , from agents to the studio executives , not to mention relatively direct spoofs of Vietnam War movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now . Then you also have the ensemble characters who add plenty of dimensional flavour and brought to life by their respective cast . Typical characters for ensemble movies get included , ranging from the action hero , the comedian , the character actor , the rapper turned actor and the newbie teenager on the cusp of his first big memorable break . While the keyart might have only Stiller , Downey Jr and Black on its marquee , the supporting roles and cameos also earn as much respect in delivering this movie , especially an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise , who dons a bodysuit to hide his pretty boy looks ( not the first time he's done in , ala Vanilla Sky ) , and possessing the rare gift of incessant swearing which I haven't seen him do since Born on the Fourth of July . His character , sleazy studio executive Les Grossman , gets my thumbs up for lighting up the screen each time he's on , and probably had single handedly stole the thunder ( pardon the pun ) from the main leads , which I thought director Ben Stiller had realized the campiness of this role , that he decided it should be milked a lot more . While he plays against type , I doubt Cruise will get any Oscar nods for this insane role , but there's always MTV to show its appreciation to his madcap antics done right , for a role and not on a couch . Besides his supporting role , there were also others such as Steve Coogan as the rookie English director having to control his prima donna actors , and also to try and keep the movie from spiralling further out of budget and schedule , and Nick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback , a Vietnam Vet who lost 2 of his hands , whose book the movie Tropic Thunder is based on , given the industry's raid on books and graphic novel material to make movies , if not going down the path of remakes . Look out also for plenty of cameos such as Jennifer Love Hewitt , Alicia Silverstone , Jon Voight , and Tobey Maguire if you're on time to view those fake trailers . And what of the leads ? I thought they probably had a good time making this movie , hamming up for their characters and providing some crazy laughs . Ben Stiller leads the team as Tugg Speedman , the action hero who desperately needs a hit to repair his reputation after a disastrous dramatic stint in which he plays the much-frowned upon retarded role of Jack the simpleton . His character is a little of a show-off , and he managed some superb nuances in his persona as the cock-sure action person . Robert Downey Jr plays his opposite number , the exaggerated multiple-award winner Kirk Lazarus who stays in character all the time until the release of the DVD commentary , undergoes a controversial surgical procedure to help him ease into the role , and shares probably some of the best scenes with Stiller in the movie . Move aside Tony Stark / Iron Man , Downey Jr's role here is more memorable ! And to round things off , Jack Black got quite muted as the fart-it-all comedian who doesn't feel appreciated and is a drug junkie , Jay Baruchel as the teenage nobody hoping that his role here amongst the heavyweights would get him laid , and Brandon T Jackson's Alpa Chino just cracks me up on his name alone , as the rapper turned actor slyly promoting the beverage he endorses , and has a very fleeting suggestion of homosexuality ( somehow the rage these days in comedies ? ) Definitely justifies its accolades as one of the comedies of the year . Get some !
515355	317399	765447	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Evening	Based on a novel by Susan Minot , Evening is a story about complex relationships , love , and family . It's drizzled with deep regret , about letting the one walk away , of not having the courage to live out the life you want , constantly allowing societal notions and norms , or how you want others to perceive you , take the unfortunate precedence over what really matters . It zooms in early on the deathbed of Ann Lord ( Vanessa Redgrave ) , where her two children Nina ( Toni Collette ) and Constance ( Natasha Richardson , real life daughter of Redgrave ) take turns to stay by her side , and in doing so , make ample room for their different viewpoints on each other's lives to come into clashing distance . At the same time , through their mother's subconscious murmurings , they discover a hidden life that their mother never discussed about , and wonder just what the juicy details are . In this respect , Evening has two separate narratives in two different timelines , and constantly flips from one to the other , but deftly doing so without making the audience lost or confused . In the earlier timeline , we begin with Ann ( now played by Claire Danes ) and good friend Buddy Wittenborn ( Hugh Dancty ) en route to attend the wedding of his sister Lila ( Mamie Gummer , and if you think she resembles Meryl Streep , then yes , because she's her real life daughter ) , who through body language confesses to them both that she's having second thoughts about her impending marriage , because of her still nursing an old flame affection for hunky doctor Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) , the son of their family's caretaker . And as the story develops , we see how relationships turn , some for the better , though it may be fleeting , while others turn for the worse . It's always a bitter pill to swallow when you discover your affections are only on a one way street , and how uncertainty play a big role in making your life miserable . As the adage goes , you sometimes can't marry the one you love , but you surely can try to love the one you marry . The depth of a woman's heart knows no bounds , and truly , the many characters here have numerous compartments in their hearts for deep dark secrets and hidden desires , coupled with some regrets . I enjoyed how the story unfolded when one is on the deathbed . Seriously , the way I look at it , I too would start to reminisce before I kick the bucket , about the life I've led , whether it was fulfilling and meaningful , and any regrets that I would have that still bugs me before I go meet my maker . If I were to have one gripe on this sad movie tinged with so many regrets , is how the story in between the timelines seem to be non-existent . The one that got away somehow wasn't fully materialized - it was suggested in part , and played on one rather disparate scene , but other than that , there was very little linkage , and you start to wonder if it's because of the guilt both parties felt , of choosing not to be around when tragedy strikes , that led to their coming together being an improbability . Evening turns out to be a very tragic love story , as warm shades of orange turn slowly into cold hard gray . Like movies with predominantly female characters such as White Oleander and Little Women , Evening boasts a stellar cast with numerous award winning actresses in their own right , coming together as an ensemble for one picture , but pity they don't get to interact all together at once , given the split in timelines . Even powerhouses Meryl Streep ( who plays the older Lila ) and Glenn Close ( as Mrs Wittenborn ) were featured separately , which is a slight pity . But their sheer presence , even if they only have supporting roles , more than lifts and add gravitas to the overall picture , where everyone fed off the collective energy of one another , providing excellent performances . It's not a date movie per se , but one that will surely initiate some long hard look at the state of your relationship , and ponder aloud with each other your take on the various issues presented , and provoke discussion into how the characters handle their situation .
515236	317399	452637	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Lady in the Water	I love it . And in the spirit of all movies Shyamalan , I'll keep mum about the plot . I loved the pace , the control , and the development of how the plot unfolded . It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer . The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic , with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters , and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch . You have the Korean mother and daughter , the Vietnam Vet , a father and son , a new neighbour , a group of cock-talkers , a guy who works out only his right side , and so on . Although most of them are one - dimensional , they are no less than endearing in their own way , like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included . I love the superb acting by the main leads of Paul Giamatti , who's fast becoming one of my favourite character actors , and in here , provided his character Cleveland Heep with much emotional baggage , pain and that almost natural stammer when nervous , and Bryce Dallas Howard , her Lady in the Water , name Story , is so beautiful , yet so enchantingly vulnerable . Both anchor this movie well and brought about believable character development , or in the case of Story , that oracle air of wisdom , wit and fear of the unknown . I love the special effects , done no less by Industrial Light and Magic . They're a pretty sight , even though some scenes were dark , literally and figuratively . Cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle , so those in Asia should already well be aware what he's capable of . There's a major departure from his previous films , which I think is probably good to keep things refreshing for the moment . Some points and scenes in the movie are so deceptively simple that you will almost guess the outcome before the next scene transition . The movie ended the way it should , instead of relying on the " next big gimmick " . And probably bad news of those who loathe directors cameo-ing in the own movies , well , this time round , Shyamalan has quite a significant role for himself . And I know why many critics out there didn't give this movie the rating it deserves . They are surprised at Shyamalan's audacity in taking a huge swipe at critics in general , since they have been highly critical of almost all his past works . It's an obvious no-holds-barred jibe at their anal characters of being high and mighty and of imposing their thoughts and opinions on others , when little do they know that their opinions mean squat most of the time . There's another cheeky reference too at romances in the rain , which I thought perhaps cinematographer Doyle would have found it amusing given his work on Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love and 2046 ( citing these 2 as I've recently watched the former ) . But those aside , thank you M Night , for sharing with us a wonderful bedtime story , which I think will be repeated at bedtime to many children around the world . It's beautiful , simple , easy to grasp , and allows for good shuteye fantasy .
514951	317399	454914	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Perhaps Love	I fell in love with the introductory analogy . Life is like the movies , in which you are the director , producer and the star . In your life , there are other co-stars , and of course , that significant other . But what if you happen not to be sharing the limelight in your other's life ? Editing is always a pain , and in the final product , you will then learn if you are sharing the same billing , get relegated to a cameo , or in the worst case , get cut out entirely and lie on the floor of the editing room . Similarly to my 2004 movie of the year , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , this film too takes a look at the trying to forget someone in your life entirely . Except in this one , there is no faux-pas scientific methods , but done by sheer human will and pretense . This is a musical within a musical , and a beautifully choreographed one at that . First thoughts will be , hey , it looks like Moulin Rouge , with big colourful sets , dancers , singers , stunts , and songs with meaningful lyrics . Yes , and given similar themes like Love and Hate , but Perhaps Love tells its own story . The soundtrack befits the musical , and I won't be surprised if anyone adapts this for the stage too . Japanese heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro plays Lin Jian Dong , a struggling film student when he met his love in Beijing . When the film begins , he's already an accomplished actor , and chances upon that same love in his latest movie collaboration . He's not the least surprised at being given the cold shoulder , and goes all out to try and win her back . But exactly what his motivations are - love , revenge , closure , that one pleasure filled fling , remained to be seen . Much is said about his ability to sing ( or lack thereof ) , but I felt that he sang convincingly in this movie , and fleshed out his role as the pained lover realistically . When his final intentions are revealed , you can't help but to emphatise - yes , that perhaps what he did was justified . Contrasting Kaneshiro's character is Jackie Cheung's Nie Wen , the auteur director with his mood swings . His current lover and muse is Jian Dong's love in Beijing , and he comes to discover this fact after filming begins . He feels cheated upon , hurt , and channels his raw emotions onto the film . There should be no doubt as to Cheung's singing prowess - powerful is the one word summed up , though I thought it's always the same song ? Between the two male leads , his is surprisingly magnanimous , and shows true courage as compared to Jian Dong . Chinese actress Zhao Xun plays Sun Na , the woman caught between the two men . One is her lover in a past she wants to forget , while the other is her lover who brought her stardom in the present world . It's a highly complicated-in-emotions role , one which explores , and for those in love , might have felt in one way , or at some points in time . When you feel your love is holding you back , would you give it all up to pursue your dreams ? Sun Na is one such woman , who will stop at absolutely no cost , and jump on every available opportunity presented , to seek fame and fortune . And it is she who walked out of Jian Dong's life at least twice , to be with an American director , and later , with Jian Dong's assistant director friend , before we currently see her in the present . Ignoring Jian Dong when they meet in their new film , she can't help but feel her icy walls being broken down by his persistence , though Jian Dong had assistance from Korean Jin Ji-hee's role as Montage , a spirit who interacts with all characters and weaves in and out of the plot , bringing about a feel that there's always that higher being involved in events that unfold in life . And the way the characters interact is probably fused so seamlessly into the musical , within the musical . Unable to express themselves freely , they do so through the musical's story , premise , and lines . It doesn't feel contrived , but the entire narrative seemed flawless . Even the flashbacks doesn't mar the pacing of the film , but brings about a natural progression and revelation of character development and events . Perhaps Love is a truly wonderful experience , especially for those who have been in the same ship before . Its ending isn't typical , but one which perhaps is the most realistic an ending can be for the characters involved . Peter Chan has crafted a beautiful masterpiece of a musical for the Hong Kong film industry . Catch this on the big screen before its run is over !
514472	317399	375679	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Crash	Crash explores racial bigotry and racial stereotypes , and is the equivalent of what Traffic did on the exploration of drugs . Given the strong ensemble cast and character actors like Don Cheadle , Brendan Fraser , Matt Dillon , Thandie Newton , Ryan Phillippe and Sandra Bullock et al , this movie contains many subplots skillfully juxtaposed into one narrative by director / writer Paul Haggis . We start off with an apparent random murder in a deserted part of Los Angeles , and from the start , racial disharmony rears its ugly head , and does so throughout . Whether be it White-Black , Black-Asian , White-Asian , White-Hispanic , Black-Hispanic , Hispanic-Arab , its off the cuff comments made by characters are starkly honest and probably expresses deeply rooted , prejudiced human emotions , and our preconceived notions of others , like if you're tattooed , you belong to a gang , if you're white and rich , you'll get mobbed by the black folks . We're brought back 24 hours prior to the discovery of the body , and this is where the tight narrative takes control in managing different subplots , yet keeping the audience thoroughly engaged with each . You have a white couple experiencing a carjack , 2 black boys in the hood ( one of them played by Ludicrous ) and their adventures , 2 LAPD detectives who have more than a working relationship , the story of 2 beat officers on opposite sides of a situation , a couple and their misadventure with the beat officers , a locksmith and his daughter amidst a gritty , harsh environment , and an Arab family . Relationships between characters are also key , as they provide a probable insight into the motivations of each character . Told in 2 acts , the first sets up the premise and explores a little of the current situation each character encounters , and touches a bit on their backstory . In the second act , this is where the amalgam and intersection of their lives come into play . And this really brings to light what six degrees of separation really mean . I'll stick my neck out and state that the narrative has NO flaws ! Awesome ! The twists come so fast , you're still in awe when you're exposed to the next revelation , and the next , until we come full circle . None of the characters are who they really are , as the narrative goes on , you start to wonder , if Mr Good Guy is really that Good , and if Mr Bad Guy is really that Bad . All characters have closet skeletons , even the minor ones , be it whether exposing their true characters through conversations , or actions , or leaving it to the audience to judge for themselves . It's amazing how the depth of each character , and for so many of them , are touched upon in the same movie . At some point , you hate someone for their prejudiced views or actions , and yet at another point , you pity the same person based upon the situation they're in . Or you might think that perhaps someone has demonstrated moderate thinking , but you'll be surprised still at the same person's subconscious harbouring of stereotypes . Most characters are shady , and this shadiness of character is present , be it if your social status or skin colour . All the actors did a commendable job in fleshing the multi-faceted roles they each play . The soundtrack contains an excellent selection of songs , but my favourite has to be " Maybe Tomorrow " by Stereophonics , played during the ending . Arnold Schwarzeneggar also had an appearance , on a photograph as the Governor of California , which I felt was a nice contemporary touch . This is highly recommended , please do not miss this , as it goes into my records as a possible contender for Movie of the Year , with its excellent foray into exploring human emotions .
514960	317399	768116	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Hula Girls	This is a story about change . Hula Girls , based on true events , takes place in a small Japanese coal mining town in the late 60s , where its town folks find that with the shifting reliance on oil from coal , the survival of their town is at stake when a major company decides to retrench and cut its headcount . In attempts to makeover their economy ( ain't that familiar ) , the sleepy town has decided to come up with a " Hawaii Center " , a resort like facility where the warm atmosphere of Hawaii will be recreated in their cold / coal environment . It's a drastic change from blue collar to the service industry , and with the young girls being roped in to be dance performers , the traditionalists are up in arms , against the entire project . Skimpy outfits and gyrating moves don't make it easy , and neither does an outsider being roped in to teach the girls a new skill , turn out popular too . Hula Girls , winner of many awards in the 2006 Japanese equivalent of the Oscars , and also the Japanese submission to the 2007 Oscar's Best Foreign Language film , actually seemed a little too familiar in its narrative style , bringing to mind movies such as Waterboys , Swing Girls , Linda Linda Linda , and the more obvious reference and similarity , will be that of My Mother is a Belly Dancer , well , for most of the first half anyway . But perhaps with this familiarity , it took less time for the audience to identify with it , and it set on its focus to endear the key characters to the audience . As mentioned , it's about change , set against the backdrop of changing industries , attitudes , and skills . It's a heartwarming story no less , about the strength of sisterhood , where unity sees them battling challenges ahead , much against all odds , especially when adversity comes from within . It's not all serious as it sounds , as there are ample comedy infused , especially with its outcast characters such as the nerdy mom and the plus sized tomboy , and their initial attempts at performance during road trips advertising their new attraction . Like movies in the similar genre , it doesn't take long to identify the leader of the pack , in Kimiko ( Yu Aoi ) , as she becomes the prot√©g√© of the teacher Mrs Hirayama ( Yasuko Matsuyuki ) , given the thankless task of whipping the girls into shape . Yu Aoi is no doubt the star of the movie , with her good looks and time dedicated for her to show what it takes . And expect a number of sniffles as the filmmakers weaved in classical dramatic moments primarily aimed at activating those tear ducts . At its heart , it's a movie on the triumph of the human spirit against adversity , and of friendship . It's not without its flaws , like when certain transitions seemed to suffer from lack of time devoted to provide more depth , but when the formula comes to the end , with its rousing , highly anticipated finale showed in its entirety and in full regalia , you'll no doubt be giving full of applause for its showmanship . Definitely going into my books as a contender for the best movies of the year . Highly recommended , despite its slow start .
514397	317399	1286172	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Sell Out !	My personal measure of an excellent comedy , is whether or not it reduces me to tears that roll uncontrollably coupled with some really deep-felt hearty laughter . While I'd like to pride myself with a good sense of humour , it does take some effort to really elicit that kind of a reaction from me , and Sell Out ! does that by the bucketloads , and through a variety of methods ranging from slapstick to the wry , from the staring-in-your-face obvious to the wink-wink-insider-jokes too . Yeo Joon Han dug deep into his plethora of talent , wearing the hats for producing , writing , editing , directing and , check this out - writing the songs ( lyrics and music composition ) as well ! And the songs are a definite highlight of the film , while not so much a musical per-se , but does have characters breaking into song to move the narrative forward . And in true , witty nature , look out for that moment that calls for YOUR participation ! Jack Neo may feel threatened that Joon Han's Money song easily rivals those he oft feature in his Money No Enough series , but my personal fan-favourite amongst the tunes would be " You're Not My Type " , with Jerrica Lai and Peter Davis delivering a duet that has to be experienced with proper sound on the big screen for its wonderful accompanying visuals that capture character emotions just perfectly . From the get go , Joon Han delivers every step of the way , all the way to the final frame , without condescending nor making the audience feel stupid . Rather , he turned the tables on himself first , in self-deprecating fashion to introduce himself as an arty-farty director and pokes fun at question-and-answer , art and commercial films , and you'll even be treated to a screening of his award winning short with some really inane dialogue . From that point on with your attention arrested , Joon Han throws every subject into the narrative almost effortlessly , with themes that are easily identifiable , but always keeping an eye out to ensure that the fun factor in every scene is never lost . Sell Out ! boasts some superb " mo-lei-tau " scenes coming in from the blind side to tickle that funny bone of yours , capturing little things that irritate in life and provide a fun spin to them , from pop culture to SMS reality shows , and who would know that Death could be so funny as well . There's a really brilliant scene in the film alongside a deathbed that encompassed plenty , and makes it all the more worthwhile for repeated viewings just to catch every possible punchline from that scene . Those paying close attention during the film will be richly rewarded with plenty of funny nuances that we would immediately guffaw at , and sly subtitles also have a life of their own , to hilarious effect . But it's not always all fun and games , and that's why this film is such the gem that it is . There's a clear commentary about doing work with heart , and wanting to be appreciated for a job well done , versus gritting your teeth and doing something that betrays your moral conscience . There's also a sharp underlying critique on modern society in general , and on corporate governance ( or the lack thereof ! ) since what more could you expect from a conglomerate that calls itself FONY and has a one-liner , though succinctly easy to understand mission statement , to " make money " , which is after all , the basic reasons for corporations to exist . The cast too are gutsy enough to trust the debut feature filmmaker , lending their vocals and performing the songs many themselves . I'd like to think that this could have also been a romance , with Eric Tan ( Peter Davis ) the honest and un-business savvy engineer with his 8-in-1 Super Soya Maker , being infatuated with Rafflesia Pong ( Jerrica Lai ) the ruthless , uncompromising go-getter who cannot wait to show her rival , the hot pan-Asian Hanna Edwards Leong ( Hannah Lo ) a thing or two about the ratings game . Then we have the scene stealers with Kee Thuan Chye and Lim Teik Leong as the Smoking and Forgetful CEOs respectfully , encompassing what we dread and probably hate most about corporate bosses who think they can get away with anything in the name of profits . There are some wonderful characterization amongst the leads , with an ensemble supporting cast to add colour , which reminded me of Citizen Dog when the man in the street joins in for a chorus about Money . Rarely has a film captured so much in under 120 minutes and making sense of it all through well-placed humour . As such , Sell Out ! has my firm vote as a personal favourite and the best of the Festival thus far , being the breath of fresh air amongst many stuffy entries that had misplaced artistic merits , alienating themselves from audiences who feel that in depressing times , we can't help but reject yet another self-indulgent movie . Sell OUt ! has nothing of that , and has set itself as a contender for my year end roundup of the best offerings in 2009 . If it was left up to me , I'd give this film both the Best Film and Best Director prizes at the Silver Screen Awards at the SIFF . The commercial release is due soon on May 7 on both sides of the Causeway , so whatever you do , please make Sell Out ! your must watch ( ! - I must exclaim this ) movie this year ! Join the Facebook group here ! And get the soundtrack from the shops while waiting for it to hit the screens ! Support good storytelling , and enjoy a great film !
515047	317399	824747	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Changeling	J . Michael Straczynski of Babylon 5 fame wrote Changeling , which is based on the true story of one woman's fight against corruption , incompetence , accusations and intimidation , all the while in searching for the truth of what happened to her beloved 9 year old son , who vanished without a trace , only for the LAPD to try and convince her that the boy they found , was indeed her son . But that's just the gist of the first hour with plenty more in store , keeping you gripped to the screen as the story develops . I continue to admire the very human stories under the direction of Clint Eastwood . His films over the last few years have been nothing less than excellent , and Changeling adds to this stellar repertoire of his . There's a certain quiet confidence in the way his films get presented , like a veteran hand masterminding all elements to fall in place perfectly . What more , it's always a treat to have the film's score composed by Eastwood himself , and the main theme is already buzzing in my head already , way after the end credits have rolled . But of course the star of the show here is Angelina Jolie . While we had not the opportunity to watch her dramatic turn in A Mighty Heart on the big screen where she plays a woman searching for her husband and for the truth , we do get to see her here playing a mother searching for her child and for answers . I particularly liked the line where she said she's not here to pick fights , but she sure would finish one , and that practically sums her her fiercely combative character in a film where she doesn't get to literally kick arse . I guess local distributors prefer to play it safe and continue to feed us with the alpha-female roles that Jolie plays , from Lara Croft to Wanted , that it's a rare opportunity to see her in a dramatic role , reminding us that she has won awards before for such roles . This is certainly a chance not to miss , because there are numerous moments where she demonstrated her acting chops . I still cannot forget that one brilliant scene , which was almost the equivalent of Ralph Fiennes ' in The Constant Gardener , where she didn't have to say her word , but just her expression alone had painted the phrase " prepared for the worst , but hoping for the best " . That alone is worth the price of an admission ticket . I suppose being a real life mother , she would have no problems with translating what would possibly be any mother's fear of losing their child suddenly and without explanation . She provides a very solid performance that hinged on everyone in the audience being able to connect with her plight and exasperation , of sympathizing with her , and rooting for her as she faces obstacle after obstacle as she goes about doing sensible things that the authorities frown upon . You'll seethe with rage when others give that can't-be-bothered attitude to a helpless mom , and feel pity that while more could be done , no finger was lifted . You'll share that tinge of hope that things will turn out for the better , and feel sad at the disappointments faced along the way , each time hoping that the outcome would be better than the last . And here's where Straczynski's story excels . There are a number of threads running that converge nicely together , and while the movie clocks in over 140 minutes , you'll never feel time plod , as you get engaged into the story , feel for the characters , and at the same time , enjoy the excellent recreation of the 1920s . There's a little bit of everything that managed to cram itself here , from mystery to courtroom drama , showcasing a variety of story settings , dealing with themes such as justice and integrity . It also contains a very strong critique of authority which is given too much power without proper checks and balances , that such power could be corrupted and abused for personal gain , before it takes those who are resolute in doing the right thing , to push for change . John Malkovich has a supporting role here as Reverend Gustav Briegleb , who has a congregation behind him as he tells it as it is in his weekly radio shows , and provides much needed intervention to assist Jolie's Christine Collins along the way . Changeling becomes the first movie this new year that I would highly recommended without hesitation . Go watch it when it opens on the 15th !
514894	317399	381849	10.0	A Nutshell Review : 3 : 10 to Yuma	It's been a long wait for the remake of 3 : 10 to Yuma to finally reach our cinemas . In fact , the Code 1 DVD is already out , and I thought it was probably missed opportunity if there are interested folks out there who decide to get the DVD instead of catching it on the big screen . I do not understand why the need for the delay , contrary to the belief that it is a Western movie which might be an unpopular genre to go into , and of course , I can only recall a handful which made it to cinemas here in recent times - Dances with Wolves , Unforgiven , Tombstone and Wyatt Earp - the last 2 being movies about the legendary lawman and the shootout at OK Corral . Some 50 years ago , audiences were introduced to the duo of impoverished rancher Dan Evans ( then played by Van Heflin ) and the number one outlaw of the land , Ben Wade ( Glenn Ford ) . As the story goes , Evans has to feed a family and the poor harvest and weather aren't doing him any favours . As Wade gets captured , volunteers are immediately called for to escort him to the town of Contention , to put him onboard the 3 : 10 train to Yuma jail , hence the title . Two powerful actors have now taken over the mantle of the 2 rivals , namely Russell Crowe ( who's having a comeback of sorts to our screens with the recently released American Gangster ) , and Christian Bale in respective roles . And unlike American Gangster which had again 2 high profile actors sharing top billing , Bale and Crowe share a lot of screen time together , thus boosting the appeal of the remake . Even for those who have seen the original , I am glad to say that on the whole , this version ranks far superior than the original version . The earlier version , being made half century ago , will definitely need a decent update for modern audiences , and that aspect did not disappoint , with more in-depth character development , and exciting shootouts . However , in my opinion , the ending of the original packed far more a punch that this one , given that the ending in the 2007 version is likely to be more in line with stories these days - the cynical , non-saccharine sweet ending . If it followed the original closely , then most audiences would have found it trying as most of the movie took place in a hotel room where the duo are waiting for the awaited time to make a run for the train station . Here , director James Mangold and scribes Halsted Welles , Michael Brandt and Derek Haas decided to boost the middle section with a detour to Apache land and encountering railroad builders ( check out Luke Wilson ! ) , presenting again more threats to the group escorting Ben Wade . Also , Ben Wade is presented in a more menacing manner , constantly probing the group and looking for opportunities to make his escape , rather than the rather subdued original which didn't exhibit any notion of danger . What I also found to be a leg up , was the swapping of importance between Evan's wife Alice ( Gretchen Mol ) and his son William ( Logan Lerman ) , which eliminated a rather awkward moment in the original where Alice paid Dan a visit whilst holed up in the hotel room . The structure and development otherwise remained about the same , and even some lines from the classic were reused in this remake , in particular in the first half of the movie . Character wise , you can't get any more better than having Crowe and Bale flesh out their characters and giving both a sense of angst , who on a better day , could probably have been good friends . You follow them as the duo gain newfound respect for each other , and the longer running time provided ample chances for the audience to find reason to connect , and understand the characters at a deeper level . Ben Wade was given time to show that he isn't all bad , despite what he tells others and from what he had done to gain his notorious reputation , and in Dan Evans , he finds the kind of life that he yearns for - beautiful wife and family , with sons who look up to the dad - but will probably never get , unless you count the mercenary hoodlums as family ( Ben Foster in a truly badass role ) . And from Evans , learning his true motivations for this suicidal job , could have made any grownup feel sorry , while he exhibits his admirable work ethics in the face of temptation , to just get the job done , to put food on the table for his family , and teaching his sons as well that it's not the size , calibre or speed of the gun that matters , but principles . 3 : 10 to Yuma deserves to be watched on the big screen , and given limited screenings and the crowding of movies this month , do make time for it . It's a perfect balance for those looking for mean gunfights , and powerful drama , and this remake delivers it all where it should matter - adopting the best bits in the original , and plugging the gaps when those portions falter . Highly recommended , even if you're not a fan of the Western genre !
514985	317399	1172203	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Sita Sings The Blues	Featured in last year's edition of Animation Nation , I finally got a chance to watch this masterpiece by filmmaker Nina Paley when she released it on the Internet under the Creative Commons License . And it is without a doubt that this piece of animation is well worth every minute of your time , especially when the visuals just arrests your attention from the get go , and has some wonderful music and songs by 1920s jazz singer Annette Hanshaw , who provides the titular Sita with her singing voice . Based on the epic Indian tale of Ramayana , focusing on the love triangle between Rama ( voiced by Debargo Sanyal ) , his virtuous wife Sita ( Nina Paley herself ) , and the adversary in the form of Ravana ( Sanjiv Jhaveri ) who lusts after Sita and kidnaps her , I have gotten a glimpse of this storyline when it got featured in films such as Swades and the more recent Delhi-6 . Essentially the extracts in those film featured how Ravana kidnaps Sita for her beauty , and wanted to make her his wife , only for her to hold out enough for Rama to find them , and to kill Ravana in an ensuing war . The story here expands that tale a lot more , starting with how Rama got banished from his kingdom by his father the King , and together with Sita , roams a forest until her kidnap , their reunion , and how Rama decided to banish her given his incessant suspicion that she may not have been pure , and got violated . It's a sad love story in a way , and this film provided just enough to pique your interest in wanting to read up more . It's quite amazing how Paley herself directed this piece of magic , and adopted various animation styles to tell a story , and a musical , and has a separate tale set in the modern day to parallel that of the epic tale . I am speechless by how wonderful the opening credits got designed , fused perfectly with the song playing in the background . Her choice of the Annette Hanshaw tunes were a wonderful touch that fit the story to a T , and this can only be attributed to some astonishing creativity and innovation that Paley had demonstrated , and I can't help but to want more . The shadow puppet narrators ( Aseem Chhabra , Bhavana Nagulapally and Manish Acharya ) stole the show each time they're on , as they sound just like your good pals who can't wait to give you the lowdown on what they know about this tragic love triangle . They're hilarious and never at any point felt deliberately so , with that very natural feel about the way they want to tell a story . I would have loved to experience this in a big screen theatre setting , but I guess that would not come anytime soon . So the next best alternative was to download the highest resolution version available to watch this astounding piece as well as to admire the striking attention to details that Paley so lovingly and respectfully put into the characters . You would do yourself a favour and watch how Sita Sings the Blues , as it's a definite must-watch in my books !
515547	317399	1220719	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Ip Man	I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie ! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes , with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen . While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung ( in the Tsui Hark movies ) , Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless , after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films . And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off , and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned , with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster . In this bio-pic , Ip Man , one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity , gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan , China , where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training . With each new school , the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel . Ip Man , an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts , will take them on behind closed doors , so as not to damage his opponents ' reputation nor embarrass them in public . His humility is his virtue , and his style is never violent or aggressive , which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate , since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman . The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war , and it's not all fight and no story . Witth this historical setting , at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told , with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese , and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit , fail to unite during dire straits . More often than note , martial arts become a unifying force , and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory . But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan , and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator , there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community . The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains , often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura ( Hiroyuki Ikeuchi ) , a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao ( Fan Siu Wong ) as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese . Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight , where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid , and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces . So what's the verdict on the action ? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action , and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit , they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie , such as private fights in his home , a factory m√™l√©e , a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer , ( which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers , mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka ) being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury , and a ringside duel amongst others . And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action , but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well . It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite , though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable final battle comes rolling along and gets delivered with aplomb . I'm no Wing Chun practitioner , but Donnie Yen has this marvelous calm and zen like approach with his Ip Man taking out his opponents quite effectively with the minimal of moves . Like Huo Yuan Jia , he doesn't deliver the killing blows to friendly opponents , but rather simulates the various hit points , which actually calls for some astonishing control of strength and precision . This approach will change of course as the opponents become anything but friendly . And unlike the usual martial arts stance of crouching low , here we see him standing tall and striking with such precision and efficiency , it's like poetry in motion with some astounding closed quarter combat utilizing plenty of upper limb strength . With Wong Kar-wai at one point also declaring interest in making a Ip Man movie , I thought that this effort will be hard to beat , just like how Tsui Hark has crafted some of the more definitive movies in modern times about Wong Fei Hung and Jet Li benefiting from a major career boost , I'd say Ip Man just about cements Yen's reputation as a martial arts leading man , which I guess the cinematic world these days severely lacks . This has to go down in my books as one of my favorite movies of the year , and I'm already setting some money aside to get the best available edition of the DVD when it gets released . Highly recommended , so make a beeline for the box office now !
514682	317399	448157	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Hancock	I'll stick my neck out and state this : Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie , then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with . Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for Lycra tights . And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand , for once I thought that a trailer barely , and I mean barely , scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story , which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book / super hero movies . But first , I'd got to admit , I'm a Will Smith fan . So at least you might have this review put into perspective . I've been enjoying the Will Smith Express with the kind of movies he's been doing for his career , even for the badly received Wild Wild West . But this guy has been in almost every genre from action ( thanks to Michael Bay ) to science fiction with I , Robot , romantic comedy with Hitch , a powerful dramatic performance with Pursuit of Happiness , and the recent remake I Am Legend , and each one I find little or no fault with . In fact , save for one or two movies in his filmography which I have not watched , it's no wonder that Smith's A-list material for his legion of fans around the world , having a name that can marquee a blockbuster movie , and one of the more consistently bankable contemporary stars . And Hancock ( ok , for this review I'd lay off all the jokes ) continues in this tradition of entertainment that isn't frivolous . To tell you more about the story would be to ruin whatever surprise it has in store , so I'll not do that . Suffice to say that like all superhero movies , Hancock is also about sacrifice , and I think that's a theme that the genre cannot do away with . It's almost always an exploration about doing the right thing , be it for the love of mankind , or those that touch on the more personal . If you'd believe the trailer as it suggests , then it's suffice to say that Hancock had to grapple with bad public relations from his jerk like behaviour ( stuffing heads up arses being his arsenal of choice ) , and that assistance comes free through the services of Ray Embrey ( Jason Bateman ) , a life which he saved by , well , causing millions of dollars in damages . If I were to scratch the surface just a little bit deeper , then I'd say that Ray represents the kind of normal life that Hancock probably wished to have , the simple , no save-the-world responsibility lifestyle , with a nice little family with wife Mary ( Charlize Theron ) and son Aaron ( Jae Head ) to boot . Director Peter Berg , who last brought us The Kingdom , dabbles with plenty of technology to bring us a man who can fly , possess incredible strength and being invulnerable to bullets . What I'd enjoyed about his take on this superhero movie , is that he didn't find a need to explain everything in verbatim , i . e . what are the powers he possess , where did he come from , and so on . sure they are addressed , but there's no need for putting it in your face , which I suspect lesser directors would have filmed flashbacks , origin subplots , enemies who are megalomaniacs who want to conquer the universe , and so on . They can be mentioned in passing , or a glance , or to let it work it out in your imagination , which of course is a powerful tool . And keeping it simple helped too , as I was really thrilled at how effective , and deceptively simple , its crescendo was developed , that it's tough to fight back tears as it goes for the juggernaut to reach out for your emotions . Clearly there were bits from the trailer which were probably put in as red herrings , or likely to have been reserved for the DVD as deleted scenes . While it runs at just over 90 minutes , the pace is frenetic , though of course not without the usual loopholes , especially with a major sequence probably to show off some cool graphics . If I were to gripe about certain things , it would be how YouTube got a significant product placement , and not actually having the actual , exact clips available ( I may be wrong but I did do a search ) , and having the camera seemed to want to take a jab at Will Smith action movies of old by continuously circling around his face ala Bad Boys . Some may also gripe about not having to see much of the born again Hancock in action , but again , the strength of this movie lies not in how it delivers its set action pieces . So what's my verdict ? To Berg , Smith and the rest of the cast and crew , Good Job ! And don't be a jerk and bolt for the exits the minute the end credits start to roll , or you deserve to have your head stuffed up another's arse .
514886	317399	478311	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Knocked Up	Writer-director Judd Apatow is probably best known for last year's sleeper hit comedy The 40 Year Old Virgin , where Steve Carrell played the titular character whose friends tried to get him laid . In Knocked Up , most of the familiar faces in Virgin returns for Apatow's latest offering , this time with Seth Rogen cast as one of the protagonists who has his hands full when he learns that he's going to be a father . But here's the catch - the pregnancy is totally unplanned , and was a result of a drunken one-night stand . Knocked Up is fertile ( pardon the pun ) ground for comedy , and Apatow's script , while it doesn't have much slapstick , turns it on by having plenty of winning dialogue , as the film chronicles the entire 9 months of the pregnancy period . And at its core , it's a true blue romance movie , with some seriousness at the side as it takes a long hard look at modern relationships , and the challenges faced by the modern family . It's expectations versus sacrifice , and Apatow really nails it all in with aplomb . The entire film is witty and so spot on , it sometimes hurts when you see things happening on screen , happen so close to home . Seth Rogen stars as Ben Stone , an unemployed man living off his insurance benefits for having been hit by a truck . He spends the day idling with his geek friends , who together , are setting up an Internet website which documents the exact moments when actresses appear nude in movies . Simply put , he's your undesirable plumb nerd who girls wouldn't want to go near . But opposites attract , and in a moment of brilliance , he manages to snog Alison Scott ( Katherine Heigl ) , a beautiful executive for E ! Entertainment , the It-girl with a bright future ahead of her , until their unprotected tryst . So it's a tussle between the two who are poles apart , to try and learn more about each other , to see if they like each other enough to want to try and do something serious about their situation . To Alison , she's keeping the baby , and to Ben , he's in for the ride , if he can prove that he's serious about it . What I liked about the movie is the subtle reminder never to judge a book by its cover , that hey , geeks ( rule ) are just as fun to be with , despite their encyclopedic knowledge about totally random bits of trivia , and that they don't have model good looks . But more importantly , as I mentioned , it takes a good hard look at modern relationships , and contrasts this perfectly by having Alison's married sister Debbie ( Leslie Mann ) , sharing the spotlight as well , with Paul Rudd as Pete her husband . They seem like the perfect all-American family , but if you chip deeper into the psyche , you can see that all is not so well , and that is contributing to the fear factor our new couple are trying to grapple with . Like The 40 Year Old Virgin , Knocked Up has its fair share of geek jokes , tons of movie references that movie fans can cheer about , and a number of uncredited cameos who just are a hoot to watch . And Ben's posse of geek buddies just about steal almost every scene they're in , despite being a little too predictable with their weed-smoking , free-loving , frequent-cursing ways . Very rarely do comedies come with a lot of heart . Knocked Up balances fun and seriousness all too well , and as a result , with its feel good ending offering plenty of hope , makes this movie one of the best this year . Highly recommended !
515420	317399	1056437	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Sky Crawlers	The Sky Crawlers seem to live up to its name , that it really took its time to tell a story , but in doing so , allowed for the narrative to sink in . After all , it's brought to us by Mamoru Oshii , and as far as his filmography goes , this Japanese maestro's works is often deep , and have more than enough room for multiple viewings , each time allowing you to take away something different , or unnoticed from the previous time round . Adapted by Chihiro Itou from Hiroshi Mori's story , you could see the themes that this movie had that would interest Oshii to be at the helm . They are nothing relatively new , as fans would see some similarities in the characters ' struggle about their own existentialism , and what I enjoyed most , the connected thread between war and peace . It's like the notion of having to prepare for war that you get to enjoy some peace , and I guess every National Serviceman would have heard that at one point or another during their tour of duty . While one can find some distinct parallels from Americanized films that pay homage or blatantly ripping off Oshii's earlier works , what I thought could have been toned down , was how toward the end , subtlety wasn't the rule of thumb , and almost every theory got explained verbatim . There were enough unanswered questions along the way to tickle your brain , leaving you guessing and drawing your own conclusions , but there were at least two crystal clear moments that decided to tell all and show all , taking away most of the fun . So in a way , you have less room to maneuver your thoughts during that after-movie discussion with friends . I could imagine and understand any kid sitting inside a theatre hall having absolutely no patience for this masterpiece . Except for the opening sequence which had packed in the action at Top Gun pace , one's notion that this was going to be a war-action movie gets thrown out the window within 10 minutes . Naturally it has the potential to go in that direction by playing up and extending the aerial dogfights , but to do so would be to dumb this film down a lot of notches . Granted its characters are pilots , and kid pilots at that , " Kildren " ( I would like to think of it as Killer-Children ) who don't seem to grow up , get careers in Corporations that seem to be waging war on behalf of nations , and pilot propeller-powered warplanes to engage their enemy in attacking and defending routines . Heck , there's even a Red Baron equivalent as the resident bogeyman too ! They smoke , they kill ( up in the air ) and they make love , with nary an adult batting an eyelid , that you would deem them all turning a blind eye to their kids ' shenanigans ( of course there's a reason for this ) . Imagine the adults being quite nonchalant , and some even supportive , of kids fighting wars while they go about their daily lives , being quite unaffected other than being a feature in news bulletins . So we follow the adventures , and mysteries weaved amongst the characters of Kannami Yuichi ( voiced by Ryo Kase ) , base commander Kusanagi ( Rinko Kikuchi of Babel fame , who had also collaborated in Oshii's omnibus movie Kill under the segment Assault Girl 2 ) . The remaining supporting characters serve out their primary purpose , such as Tokino ( Shosuke Tanihara ) as the wingman / buddy , and Mitsuya ( Chiaki Kruiyama , Kill Bill's Gogo Yubari ) as the tell-all mouthpiece , which I thought that even without , the coda after the end credits roll would have summed it all up nicely . This is Japanese anime , so its quality is excellent , with some really photo-realistic moments , and aerial dogfights that look as real as if they really built those planes and shot them in mid air . John Woo would also be proud at how balletic the shoot-em-ups can get , pulling back its punches as well to avoid any explicitness in its violence . The main theme of the soundtrack is extremely hypnotic and would linger on you for some time after the end credits roll . After all , it's by Kenji Kawai . This is not an action movie , period . If that's the kind of movie you're expecting , then my advice would be to save your ticket money . If you're looking toward something that's more contemplative , and dealing with themes that would make you think along the way ( until the two mentioned moments where the hints get more obvious ) , and maybe even appreciate life a little more , then march up to the box office when this opens next week . Highly recommended , and definitely a contender when I compile the top ten list for the year !
515154	317399	46313	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Lady WIthout Camelias	While this is the third feature film of Michelangelo Antonioni , it would mark the second time that Lucia Bose had starred in his film , the first being Antonioni's debut feature Story of a Love Affair . As Lorenzo Cordelli pointed out , Antonioni's The Vanquished had made its debut at the Venice International Film Festival , and in this movie , it contains scenes from the Festival , thereby giving it a somewhat documentary feel as it serves as a backdrop . It tells the story of a fictional star , charting the meteoric rise and fall of her career , and made quite a statement on the Italian film industry of the time , which was producing more than 300 features annually . Again , the female of the species turn out to be quite strong in character , while the male counterparts continue the trend of being rather meek , and lacking some alpha-male qualities befitting of a leading character status . Here , we have Lucia Bose's Clara Manni , a shopgirl from Milan who was talent spotted and brought to prominence on celluloid by film producer Dr Gianni Franchi , who together with the film world , fell in love with the dazzling beauty ( Bose herself was crowed Miss Italia once before ) . In today's context , this would be akin to continued casting calls for any scream queen / sex siren / teenage starlet to be typecast in a role in their respective blockbusters , with nary an opportunity for them to venture out of the tried and tested , all in the name of profit . Being rushed into marriage in the middle of a film production , we see how Gianni turns into a green-eyed monster , possessive of his trophy wife and chiding her for wanting to go along with the norm in getting herself casted in roles that require the revelation of some flesh , be it in steamy love scenes or in seductive poses in glossy magazine spreads . Granted , his idea of marriage is to have her become a homemaker given his wealth to provide her a more than comfortable life , but to Clara , it's akin to being imprisoned . So one will come to expect the usual marital woes that befall couples as fools who rush in , and find themselves smashing head on toward a rocky time . In today's blockbuster world , I guess it's obvious that sex and violence sells . In those days , as explained by the producer character Ercole ( Gino Cervi ) , sex , religion and politics in movies put bums on seats , which accounts for why scantily clad women could have been considered a de-facto " must-have " in order to appeal to the lowest denominator amongst audiences . To Gianni , in his good intent to want to elevate his wife's status to drama-mama , decided to make an art-house Joan of Arc ( which we are spared the torture of watching , only provided glimpses of it ) , much against the common grain of film-making , and with Clara being bored to tears , decided to go along with the project . With her Joan of Arc being both a critical and commercial failure , Clara becomes vulnerable . But here's where her character got interesting . Like Eve , she's fully aware of the forbidden apple , but yet found herself weak to resist the advances from a fan . She conscientiously knows of the destructive path she'll be walking down , both in reputation and personal life should she embark on an affair , but I guess the appeal that Mr Nardo ( Ivan Desny ) had , was being the wedge at the right point in time when she was emotionally at her weakest . Again , Nardo is a slimy male character that one would love to hate , given his motive of personal satisfaction in having to conquer a famous actress . However , you must salute his thick - skinned persistence and his great pretension , well hidden behind a suave demeanour . The saddest character here remains Gianni Franchi . You'll realize that while he has the best of intentions for his wife , life would have it that her reaction to his concern would go unappreciated most of the time . And pride would come in the way when someone who had broken your heart once , come knocking on your door for an opportunity . As Clara's character develops , she slowly learns about her naiveness , and becomes more aware of the business side of the industry . Here's where the film becomes a critical mouthpiece of the state of Italian cinema at the time , which led to potential Claras dropping their willingness to star in the film lest they offend industry folks . It makes comparisons and draws parallels between the exploitation of an actress's good looks , versus grooming them into serious thespians , and through Clara's bold reinvention of herself , one would have thought she would have learnt a valuable lesson to apply , given an about turn with her new found understanding and strength . But as it turns out , there's this invisible glass ceiling in place . I thought the ending was one of the most powerful ones , and a definite heart-wencher , seen thus far . It has a resignation to Fate , that no matter how hard one tried , the outcome has already been pre-determined by the stars , and try as you might , you just cannot effect any change . The streaming of tears down the eye , while masking it as tears of joy and forcing a smile , probably reflects Clara's greatest acting moment to date , smiling to mask some extreme unhappiness toward her life and career choices , that she became nothing more than a train on a railroad , following the tracks laid out in front of her . The absolute last frame that lingers , is well worth a ticketed admission , for the fact that Clara finally got to act .
