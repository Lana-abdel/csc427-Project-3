515277	317399	1213644	1.0	A Nutshell Review : Disaster Movie	I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie . It is without a doubt a total disaster . I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made , after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans ( OK , I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie ) , because while it's spoof after spoof , it certainly isn't cheap trying to replicate certain stuff , even if done laced with loads of cheese , or swede-d . Should there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together , then it would be Cloverfield , where a group of friends Will ( Matt Lanter , whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right ? ) , Calvin ( G . Thang ) , Juney ( Crista Flanagan ) , Lisa ( Kimberly Kardashian ) and the Enchanted Princess ( Nicole Parker ) journey to save Amy ( Vanessa Minnillo ) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity , where the threat of mankind is raining cows . The only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie , be it borrowing characters or premise . You'd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy , and frankly speaking , they're at best some skits which for the life of me , are totally unfunny . Nada , zilch , nothing to laugh about . I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off . Which is not strange , considering that even jokes were borrowed , and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour , which is already so tired . While there are comedies which can be original , the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer , coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie ( s ) , would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation . Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing , but making a genuine and workable comedy is another . Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with , but I'm likely to think that everyone approached , save for the relative no-names here , would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole , just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography . I think it's even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer . The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions , and given some belt-tightening in the economy , hopefully this should be soon .
515549	317399	780595	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Redline	You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed . That's why movies like Fast and the Furious , Dhoom , Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences , especially local ones . We live on a tiny island , and I cannot fathom why , for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system , most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 % tax when they reach our shores , and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one . Not only that , the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear , lest they reach the sea . And these movies are relatively easy to make . Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic . For once , those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long , can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these . Of course there are amongst us ( ahem ) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects ( otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models , and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame ) , however , they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen , even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park . The guy sitting beside me , I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car ( s ) appear , and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans . So there we have it , the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie . With the Fast and the Furious franchise , the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage , as does the GT . Here , the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification , that even I'm impressed , alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos , Porshe Carerra GTs , Koenigsegg CCXs , and every car out there that has wings for doors . But seriously , my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment . I mean , this are perfectly fine , high performance models that are at the apex of motoring , but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow , they do so because they can , There's no story in Redline , just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties ( the cars that is ) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible , and with the usual shots of pedals ( always the accelerator , mind you , tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy , and earn you no respect ) , steering wheels , gear shifts ( always shifting up and not down ) , all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine , snarling and giving each other dirty looks . Not a very tall order for an actor , and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever , with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids . The heroine ( yes , it made a statement that girls can drive ) Natasha ( a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin ) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil , who has racing pedigree within her , and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable ( every line had to do with cars , and when singing about love , just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts , lubricants and going for rides ) . Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous ( Eddie Griffin ) , she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran , and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle . Everything else , well like I said , just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race . And it's almost always the same , as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars , especially when you know the race is rigged ( for narrative reasons ) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line . While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors , and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker , Sun Kang , and of course , the star it created - Vin Diesel , Redline had none , just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately . It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go , with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man , one car , and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas . If not for the cars , then this movie seriously is a piece of junk , with bad acting , bad lines and bad action . Strictly for the car fans , or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines .
514629	317399	454457	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Frostbiten	To think I was once avoiding horror movies because I thought I was chicken . Hell , I now believe the real reason's cause there are so many bad horror movies out there , that it's just not worth the time and money to watch them on the big screen . This Swedish movie unfortunately , is one of them . Frostbiten started off promisingly , with a link back to the horrors of WWII , where soldiers were being cut down in size by the enemies . They stumble onto an unused hut , but before they can get a good night's rest , they realize that there is something mysterious about the entire place , and got attacked by strange creatures . It's quite an extended scene before the opening title , but we get fast forwarded to today . Mother and daughter Annika ( Petra Nielsen ) and Saga ( Grete Havnesk√∂ld ) come to a new town to start life anew , but before they get settled down , it's a mixed bag of incidents which see Annika uncovering a deep dark secret in the hospital she works in , and Saga's teenage friends getting high on an experimental drug without their knowledge , and get turned into vampires . So begins a battle on both fronts as they fend off vampire rejects from Underworld . The story is nothing to shout about , being very weakly made up of lame excuses just to feature the vampires in various fang-sinking-into-necks opportunities . Plenty of things went wrong , right up until its ending , which tried to be too intelligent for its own good with a suggestive open ended ending , and it doesn't make much sense . At times , the movie's littered with humour , but in cheesy ways as it wasn't able to decide whether to be funny , or dead serious with the antics . It's nothing scary , but there were copious amounts of blood used to up the gore factor . Come to think of it , certain production aspects turned out quite childish with its lack of attention to continuity issues , although there were some sparks of brilliance in its special effects department . Other than that , if you really want to experiment with a foreign language horror movie , just wait for the discs to arrive .
515575	317399	855824	2.0	A Nutshell Review : I Don't Want to Sleep Alone	I don't want to sleep alone - if you have incredible patience , then you probably won't have to . Otherwise , within 10 minutes , you'll fall into deep sleep , as did somebody in the same screening I went to . I have put off writing the review to see if my opinion would change , and I dare say it has mellowed down . I would have loved to condemn this Tsai Ming-Liang movie , but just like any other movie , its bound to have its lovers and detractors . I for one , disliked the film , but acknowledge its technical merits . Simply put , the movie tells 2 stories , one involving a man ( played by Tsai's muse Lee Kang - Sheng ) being attacked by gangsters , and taken in and cared for by a construction worker ( Norman Atun ) , while the other story involves a comatose man ( also starring Lee ) being nursed by Chyi ( Chen Shiang-Chyi ) , a coffeeshop waitress working for Pearlly Chua's sexually repressed coffeeshop owner . In classic Tsai style , these stories are told in long , static shots , little or no dialogue , and through songs . The usual themes of alienation , repression , loneliness etc ( fill in the blanks , you know the themes already ) is commonplace in the movie , so much so that they become turn offs . At times you wonder if it's a comedy of absurdity , and if the movie is a waste of film and resources . You also scratch your head wondering if those who have praised the movie sky high are out of their minds , or if they're following the bandwagon and praising the emperor's new clothes . However , I did enjoy the first few minutes of the movie when Lee's wandering man walked around the seedier streets of KL . In fact , there isn't really much clues that it's KL , it can be Geylang for all you care . And possibly every dark corner and roadside become commonplace as the narrative moves along . If anything , Tsai is an inspiration , for his minimalist art form that makes as if almost anyone could pick up a camera , gather some actors ( or friends with zero facial expression - you can mask them , or film from across the road so there are no close up shots to betray their lack of ability ) around , and make something out of nothing . Just as how crazy men are called eccentric rather than mad if they have power and money , you'll just have to convince that you're an auteur with an amazing eye for details , instead of being called a crap filmmaker if you try and emulate his style . To some it's pretentious , to others it's a contemporary classic in the works . The only way to best judge if you would like the movie , is to watch it yourself . Just be warned that you'll either be enamoured by it , or come out swearing every vulgarity you've ever known . I sure heard many colourful words when the mattress started to float . If compared to his previous work The Wayward Cloud , I'd find that a masterpiece . But then again , I've always liked my movies with song , dance , things that move , not just a reluctant handjob . Will I watch future Tsai's works ? Sure , if only as a test of true patience , for film school lessons and references , and to share in the perverse joy of listening out for newbies to Tsai movies as they exercise their freedom of colourful speech . They are a vocal bunch after all . Recommended only for hard core Tsai fans , and no one else .
514378	317399	461703	2.0	A Nutshell Review : Skinwalkers	The poster may look menacing , but Skinwalkers is actually a tame pussycat . In the hands of ordinary filmmakers , this is what you get - mediocre , " have we seen this before " moments , and plenty of unintentional comedy , for a werewolf genre that tried to reinvent itself , and exhausted its game plan . To give itself a mystical feel , it developed its own uninteresting mythos about some prophecy ( not again ! ) that will come true after the appearance of the red moon . Zoom past the intertitles , and hey , the red moon ! From then on , it's Terminator-hasta-la - vista baby ! The prophecy seemed to dwell on the fate of a 12 year old boy , who is said to have some rocking puberty mumbo-jumbo happening to him ( no , it's not the sudden growth of extra hair in certain parts ) . So his mother , Rachel ( Rhona Mitra ) becomes an unwitting , uninspiring Sarah Conner clone , while relying on a bunch of rag tag team mates led by Jonas ( Elias Koteas ) , to keep them alive . Jonas and gang however , have a deep dark secret . They're werewolves , but good ones , who get strapped up before dusk so that they can be artificially restrain their blood lust . On the other hand , the bad mofos ( who are also werewolves ) are led by Lorenzo Lamas . Wait a minute , that couldn't be him ! He's still looking . . . so young ! No , it's Jason Behr , who I swear in his unshaven face , and wavy shoulder length hair , shades and bad attitude , seemed to have crawled out of a typical Lamas made-for-video movie . As with the many Lamas movies , it's almost guaranteed to have bad cheapskate action . It screams B-Flick with sirens blaring and strobe lights flashing , and frankly , Skinwalkers is nothing except that . Like I mentioned , it's Terminator all over again . Bad guys want to annihilate the kid so that they can prevent the prophecy from coming true ( whatever that is , which they have no clue whatsoever ) . In between , they kill and have edited sex , which is bad , in both sense . The good guys just want to stand in the way ( hey , we don't feed on blood , so we're cool ) and they too have no idea just in case the kid turns into some hybrid - OK , wrong movie - while we see the toughening up of Sarah Con , I mean Mitra's Rachel , that it all reeked of plagiarism . If anything can justify labelling a werewolf movie as cheap , then it is the distinct lack of on - screen transformation . The wolves just appear , in full hairy costume , bad teeth and probably stinky breath and all , without any attempts to allow a glimpse at the transformation . Not only that , the local distributors , in attempts to make money hence requesting this to be passed with a lower rating , removed all sex scenes . No wonder we see macabre , gruesome high profile killings , and low birth rates . We can't even watch sexy on screen . Bring the sexy back ! Anyway I digress . Skinwalkers was pretty bad from the get go . Hokey prophecies , cheap makeup , and horrors , guns are used with glee from all quarters , and the gunplay's probably the laziest I've seen in a long time . Laughable effort , especially when you realize the cop out made just for the bigger names in this picture . Only suitable for that DVD rental on a lazy weekend afternoon at best .
514986	317399	1260932	3.0	A Nutshell Review : 252 Signal of Life	While a movie like this would likely contain a tragedy of epic proportions and a celebration of the human spirit , one can't help but to laugh at its missteps , overwrougt melodrama , and sheer ridiculousness of an ending that probably insults the professionalism of the uniformed group it wanted to put in good light . It becomes an unintentional comedy of errors that just makes you shake your head knowingly that it could have been something more interesting to begin with . 252 : Signal of Life is just that , a code that rescue forces ( or at least in Japan ) use to inform everyone of survivors , galvanizing resources and to propel some lung bursting morale and adrenaline to rescuers who are risking life and limb for strangers that they do not know . But first they have to get their original mission statement through to the top brass whose concern is for the safety of the men under them , and risk taking becomes a tedious exercise , frustrating to the men all eager to perform a job well . I thought this tussle against the backdrop of an ongoing disaster would serve as an interesting fuel for thought , especially meaningful when it tries to examine how these folks put others above self , and family beneath others at times , and had an extreme opportunity to debate over self-preservation , and to wonder the immense courage that it takes for one to do just that . Instead , we get melodrama , plenty of tears and frustrations lashed out amongst colleagues , friends and strangers , that it becomes too tiring , and most of the time for nothing . For actor Hideaki Ito , one who has cut his teeth in disaster-rescue flicks like Umizaru and its sequel , his role here as ex-rescuer Yuji Shinohara might seem like a walk in the park . If not for his brooding of a sin of the past , and his good looks , he's an extremely cardboard character , which is what most of the other characters in the film are made of . Only Ayane Omori who stars as his deaf-mute daughter Shiori stole the show at every scene she's in , though the good work was destroyed by the story which decided to exploit that character for some Kleenex moment . I can go on about other characters in the film that continue to be unappealing such as Sachiko Sakurai's very teary turn as Mrs Shinohara , but the one which takes the cake , and probably chief villain for her incompetence , is Yu Kashii's Saki Umino the weather girl who has really poor forecasting skills . The filmmakers here lacked the courage to have people bumped off . Not the anonymous extras that are in the background ( those die en masse ) , but each deadly scenario the leads got put through , they lacked the confidence to shut the door on the characters , making it again highly repetitive in crafting how one survives death defying moments due to sheer luck , but only after some moments of unnecessary tension that the same trick just becomes overused by the time the third scenario rolls around . What's more of a sin was how the finale was one really draggy affair , allowing opportunities for more chest-thumping , affirmative actions like nodding , saluting , shouting , crying , and just milking all that's worth from an 18 minute window when the eye of the storm passes by . Speaking of which , the special effects turned out to be less than spectacular . It showed off some eye-popping moments of gigantic tidal waves enveloping the streets of Tokyo , but it dried off really fast through some awesome drainage that the city has in its streets and underground network . Visually , it was more interesting to see how all the extras in each scene just run about the set in the background trying to look busy and act with a sense of urgency , while the cast in the foreground are feeling anything but that . As I mentioned earlier the finale was overwrought with cheesy melodrama that unnecessary dragged out the ending , but the moment which took the cake was how hundreds of rescuers would just gather round and do nothing but the care-bear-stare . Powerful stuff that . 252 : Signal of Life had moments where it could have struck a fine balance in presenting an action-packed flick if it could have tightened up some of the incessant repetition ( like how long it took for massive floodwaters to fill up a subway station , and there are only so many ways for extras to find themselves facing with a gush of water ) , and to have given itself enough time to explore the human dilemma of self-preservation versus the call of duty . Instead it became an unnecessary comedy filled with cardboard yet invincible characters .
514371	317399	985079	3.0	A Nutshell Review : Anna & Anna	Earlier this year , there was a casting call for extras to be in Anna & Anna , with the presence of lead actress Karena Lam , and looking at the film , it would have involved being night club revelers in a darkened pub watching local band Ronin perform . This Singapore-Shanghai co - production , written and directed by Aubrey Lam , is surprisingly full of art-house sensibilities , but with all the wrong reasons in doing so , making this less than 90 minute film feel like a plodding dinosaur , hinging on the acting prowess of Karena Lam and Lu Yi ( Jasmine Women , Seven Swords ) . Karena plays Anna & Anna , and may I add , & Anna once more . Anna One is an executive with an extreme love for blue eye shadows . A Singaporean sent by her manager ( played by TV actor Huang Shi Nan ) to Shanghai for work , she finds this an opportunity to rid herself of her wimpy boyfriend , Billy ( Tender , whose name befits the character ) , a band member whose long hair betrays his effeminate nature . Here's an alpha-female in a power suit , but inside , she's still nursing a longing for her old flame Ouyang ( Lu Yi ) . Anna Two happens to be an artist , with a chic short pageboy hairdo ( ok , this is to differentiate between the Annas ) , and surprisingly , is hooked up with Lu Yi's Ouyang . Questions are abound as to timeline , and whether they are the one and the same , or different people who just happen to share the same pretty face . Anna Two's no alpha-female though , and seems to be one who's emotionally tormented by Ouyang , and so begins , the incessant questions of identity that begged to be answered . The narrative started off promisingly with such possibilities of exploring into doppelgangers , identities , and especially on love , whether we will tend to gravitate towards people of similar characteristics , or in more shallow terms , physical looks ( hey , remember the Vaughn-Aniston vehicle The Break Up , and the ending for that ? ) . It set up interesting standoffs such as who's the original , and who's the substitute for the heart , which will probably make for some unconventional romantic story drawing from life experiences . But alas , the movie lost its plot halfway in becoming too schizophrenic for its own good , especially when Karena's Anna One decided to chop her locks off , and the film had to rely on technicalities to cue the audience . What it degenerated to was failure to capitalize on its prince and pauper moments , and became was a woeful reflection of self-pity by all characters , and this without unnecessary meandering through timelines . Which was actually guilty in trying to introduce and sustain the backstory , and hence my interpretation of the hypothetical Anna Three , which I felt was there just to extrapolate the running time to qualify this as a feature film . Shave away the unnecessary extras and half - baked ideas , and this would have been watchable at the very least . However the actual end result we get is a soulless film with soulless characters that we don't give a hoot about .
515173	317399	845442	3.0	A Nutshell Review : Cinderella	No , this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach , fairy godmother and the glass slippers , but if I were to elaborate , I would have to spoil it for you , which I won't . But don't let curiosity get the better of you , as this movie is not fantastic . It's one of those movies that start off promisingly , before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline . And that's real horror . Yoon-hee ( To Ji-Won ) and Hyun-soo ( Shin Se-kyeong ) are your ideal mother and daughter . One's a successful plastic surgeon , while the other your dutiful , obedient , and beautiful teenage daughter . Their relationship is like hand in glove , so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent-child . But things start to go wrong ( don't they always ) when Hyun-soo's friends , whom Yoon-hee has operated on , start to go berserk . Perhaps it's a warning to audiences , and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife , if news reports are to be believed . The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery , though somehow , I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself . It's a tale of two halves , the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics , which , I admit , did get to me now and then . However , the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics , and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat . Some things begin not to make sense , and while attempts are always presented to explain , you probably won't buy it , not that horror movies are logical to begin with . The leads are all beautiful , and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role . But hey , I'm not complaining , though the storyline could have been improved tremendously . I'd recommend you to watch this , only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror , on VCD . Watch out for those face off-ish moments !
514859	317399	1133594	3.0	A Nutshell Review : Shaolin Girl	Ever since the success of Stephen Chow's Shaollin Soccer in 2001 , he's been asked time and again whether a sequel was in the works . There still isn't , but he sort of franchised the idea out to the Japanese and served as executive producer , so the outcome of the deal , was Shaolin Girl . However , the net of it all is that while the intent for a quasi-sequel is there , having the Japanese play characters experts in the classic Chinese form of martial arts might seem a little wrong , just like how the hue and cry came about with Chinese characters portraying Japanese geishas . But if the source in contention was treated with respect , I guess there would be no qualms moving forward , though with the way things were treated here , you would've pondered whether it was done in jest , or in mockery . For instance , the numerous Bruce Lee homage . Yes , we all know about all things yellow , so it's a no brainer here . But to have a lookalike come out as a villain , dressed in a white singlet , black pants and emulating Lee on the nunchuks , was a tad below the belt , especially the way he was disgracefully dispatched . A friend of mine said it was perhaps a kick in the face toward all the imitations and wannabes , but I'd like to think otherwise . The finale look straight out of Game of Death where our alpha-female do battle floor to floor encountering various martial arts masters , but come to think of it , they were dispatched with incredible ease . And don't get me started on the corridor of mirrors too , which served no purpose other than to show that the filmmakers can . Lead actress Kou Shibasaki ( from Crying Out Love In The Center of the World ) in the titular role looks good and cute for the part in order to draw in the crowds , and granted she has no martial arts background ( ala new female warrior Jeeja Yanin in Chocolate ) she makes up for it with artificially choreographed grace that made her a little believable . What's not believable , was her ability to speak Chinese , and the Shaolin monks as well , because they are clearly Japanese , but had to pass off as experts in the language , which came off as unbearable and laughable . You might think that director Katsuyuki Motohiro , with his Bayside Shakedown pedigree , would be deft at handling stories with multiple subplots . However , Shaolin Girl bitten off more than it could chew , and couldn't decide what it wanted to be . On one hand , it wanted to spread the love for Kung Fu , or specifically , the Shaolin brand of fist-fighting . On the other , it had to reflect on its supposed predecessor and fuse in a sport different from soccer ( here it's Lacrosse ) . And it wanted to weave kung fu into the game , only to hold back to prevent itself from being a clone . So while you get a sport , there isn't much copycat kung-fu styles and stances , until the end credit roll when it became obvious . Shaolin Girl Rin Sakurazara was sent as a kid by her grandfather to China's famed Shaolin school of martial arts to learn to curb and control her wealth of potential , promised power . What this power was , nobody knew , except that everyone knew she had to be protected from the villains lest she gets tempted to go to the Dark Side ( yes , so very Star Wars ) . But she returns upon completion of her training to revive her grandfather's dojo , and does so in quite an impetuous headstrong manner , that she has a few lessons to learn herself , such as humility , camaraderie and teamwork , before she can impart those martial arts lessons . However , despite all that talk about teaming , it still boiled down to a one-woman whackfest for the last act . If you're looking for some serious fighting , then the first two acts of the movie will bore as you only get teases spruced very much by special effects , some bits too , especially those involving Lacrosse , got too repetitive . Kitty Zhang , Chow's new muse from CJ7 , ends up in this movie too to provide some lesbian undertones ( ok , so I chose to read it that way , but think about it ) . and although she has a meatier role here as a naive do-gooder , the role still boiled down to a flower vase in cheongsam . And if you're patient and were waiting to be rewarded with some proper combat for the finale , be prepared to be disappointed too . For all the talk about her prowess , you'll laugh at what Rin pulled off . Not that it's a comedy and you're supposed to chuckle , but you're laughing at its delivery instead , for all the wrong reasons . Never have I seen something that hokey , and anti-climatic as well . Not only that , the fights were unimaginative and , horrors , boring too , while the villains were all reduced to mindless goons ala Crazy88 style , with some tendencies to caress man boobs , and totally unmenacing , with lead villains having zero motivation other than to desire to fight . I nearly fell off my seat when it ventured close to The Promise territory with its take on the tykes . Even supporting appearances by characters from Shaolin Soccer couldn't save the day , and became ridiculous caricatures of themselves . Perhaps what could rescue Shaolin Girl , was a cameo by Chow who probably might have upped the credibility of this flick , but alas , knowing that it would stink , he rightfully kept his distance . And so should you , unless you're a fan of either Kitty Zhang or Kou Shibasaki , then you can lap up all the close-up shots .
515216	317399	371853	3.0	A Nutshell Review : The Nun	This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun ( La Monja ) . Seriously , I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles , even though the story's about the character as described in the title . Who knows , soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk , The Priest , and others belonging to various religious sects . The basic premise goes very simply , that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb ( so that it can lay claim to the title ) goes around killing ex-convent girls . There seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved , as the daughter of one of the victims , Eva ( played by an eye candy Icelandic Anita Briem ) , goes on to discover , with the help of a few good friends , like a rip off of I Know What You Did Last Summer ( mentioned also , by the way ) . So as the body count increases , it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred ( aren't they always ? ) heroine to uncover the truth and save the day . Delving into the sins of the mothers , the movie did the unthinkable , that with a dream sequence as the introduction . I hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly , and there are a couple of them in the movie . In part , the movie played at times like Ju-On gone wrong with the plenty of Dark Water references , and they could have retitled this Unholy Water , for the circumstances and plot points in the movie . However , there are plot holes abound , so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply . You'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun , and sets which look like they can rival recent Thai horror movie Dorm . The acting's pretty forgettable , with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented English . And since most of them are pleasing to the eye , the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch-hunt . What gives ? Hello , got hantu , still got mood ah ? Then again , the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated / SFX which has a built in AI of popping up every now and then , in various fashion , just to elicit screams from timid audiences . The characters also break every unwritten rule in the Do-Nots in horror lore , so you know and expect their just desserts . Can you possibly enjoy this movie ? Sure you can . Just ensure that you're watching it in a full house ( should be easy , since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific ) , and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every " frightening " scene . It's pretty fun , and adds to the atmosphere , besides what's going on the screen . Surround sound doesn't even come close . Think of it as watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the wisecracks , and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating . Those could possibly have been the best bits , now left rotting on the censor's floor board .
515499	317399	362120	4.0	A Nutshell Review : Scary Movie 4	I'm a fan of campy grossed out politically incorrect comedies , so films like Top Secret ! , Airplane , Hot Shots and Naked Gun , are right up my alley . For some strange reason , I never did watch any of the past Scary Movies , save for the bits shown in various trailers . And I'm sad to say that Scary Movie 4 , is unfortunately , not very funny . Sure , it contained the usual barrage of explicit toilet humour , sexual innuendos in the dialogue , and plenty of sight gags involving genitalia , but I guess too much of something will make you sick of it . And that's what happened with SM4 . The main leads of Tom Ryan ( Craig Bierko ) and Cindy Campbell ( Anna Faris ) find love despite having to separate because of the Tri-pod alien invasion . Each took a different path - Tom in keeping his family alive during the carnage , while Cindy has to undertake a mission to discover the truth behind the invasion , after being tipped off by a faux-speaking Japanese ghostly kid who can't walk backwards down a staircase . Doesn't make much sense , does it ? It doesn't matter actually , with comedies of this genre . But you got to admire the scriptwriters for almost seamlessly including the many references and scenes from so many thrillers and horror movies , and weave them all into one complete narrative , never mind if it doesn't make much sense at the end of the day . It's not easy collating the recognizable scenes , and piecing them together . The main bulk of references would have to come from Spielberg's War of the Worlds , Ju-On , Saw and The Village , just to name a few . Real life personalities were also not spared being buffooned , like Tom Cruise , Michael Jackson , Shaquille O'Neal and even George W Bush ( played by Zucker regular Leslie Nielsen ) . Maybe the franchise is running out of steam , or the references the movie pulled from were not very interesting as spoofing material to begin with . I wouldn't recommend this weak comedy , even though a Scary Movie 5 has been announced . Yikes .
514923	317399	349903	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Ocean's Twelve	I got mixed feelings watching the film . It's supposed to be a heist flick , but doesn't feel that way . On the other , it's fun to watch the big name stars hamming it up on screen having a great time . One of the best parts is when Julia starts to play herself , and the cameo by Bruce Willis as himself is a hoot Other than that , the heist part is a bit of a let down - if compared to the first film , this one lacked the the sophistication of planning , twists , and the air of confidence , and everything about the heist ( more than one ) is told in flashbacks . Not as fresh as Ocean's 11 , but Catherine Zeta Jones , yeah she's hot
515363	317399	499556	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Rogue Assassin	War undergoes one of those unnecessarily title changes for this part of the world , naming itself after Jet Li's assassin character Rogue . Billed as " The Ultimately Martial Arts Duel of the Year " , the person who wrote that blurb for Rogue Assassin obviously hasn't seen many movies , or martial arts ones for that matter , or is plain lying through the teeth . You'd half expect that pitting two action stars against one another will instantly mean box office success by pulling in fans of both Jet Li and Jason Statham , but it's a downright insult as you don't see any punches pulled between the two for 99 % of the time . Jason Statham actually starred opposite Jet Li in the movie called The One back in 2001 , where Li had no decent cinematic opponent to spar with , and had to do so with himself , assisted by CGI . With his movies like Crank and The Transporter doubles becoming guilty pleasures ( read : just Statham kicking up a storm without a reasonable story to boot ) , I'd actually come to enjoy his work choreographed by Corey Yuen ( who also does the action choreography here ) , together with other ensemble movies he starred in , like The Italian Job and Snatch , amongst others . It's no doubt I'm a fan , but in Rogue Assassin , all he had to show off his fighting chops , was a sequence in a ubiquitous teahouse . But Jet Li fared no better too . His Hollywood foray had been more misses than hits , either playing assassins or cops like in Kiss of the Dragon , or be stuck in roles that require little dialogue and only to look bad-ass , like in Lethal Weapon 4 , and Cradle 2 the Grave . Or the easiest of all , forget dialogue and kick around like a mad dog - no offense but that's what he really did in Unleashed ( which I thought the notion of it all was rather degrading for an action star ) . Nonetheless he goes back to a story on warring factions again ala Romeo Must Die , but this time , it's not between boyz in the hood , but putting Japanese Yakuza and Hong Kong Triads in the streets of San Francisco . As I mentioned earlier , there's nothing martial arts here . Everything is guns , guns and more guns , with a complimentary sword fight put in , but not between the touted leads . The action sequences , from fights to chases to stunts all looked rather tired and rehashed , with absolutely nothing that will make you go " wow , that's nothing I've seen before " . Statham and Li share no more than 5 minutes together in the same scene , and only at best a minute bashing each other up , in the dark , in a narrow dock warehouse , before launching into more verbal mumbo jumbo . Everything here is a caricature , and not even a clich√©d revelation saved the movie , when it had expected to , except to give some runway to a possible sequel . War / Rogue Assassin reeks of plain laziness , and plays out like a cartoon . In trying to be sophisticated , having to label locales with " The Triad Warehouse " , or " The Yakuza Lair " was just plain hilarious , unintentionally of course . The number of supporting caricatures , some recognizable Asian actors , all fall into the realm of predictability , and the villains are all too smug and too boring . You have HK actor Mark Cheng ( from his latest movie Invisible Target ) lending his charisma but becoming a laughing stock , John Lone demonstrating he's still very much being typecast in Hollywood roles , Devon Aoki continuing to be that flower vase who doesn't look good up close ( somehow the cinematic camera dislikes her ) , and hey , once TV actress from this part of the world , Steph Song , gets a cameo too , spending most of the screen time screaming . Everything's pure flash with zero substance . Even in trying to be a little sophisticated in its plot , it decided to allow some plot loopholes to go through an exercise of the implausible , and put in some major character motivation error . But then again , we're talking about cartoony caricatures here , so that probably won't matter . It became a victim of its own star casting - you don't know who you want as the bad guy , and as a result , becomes a below par mediocre , generic action movie that you can stick some other monkeys in and still work .
515453	317399	770752	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Fool's Gold	Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson paired up in a chick flick some 5 years back in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , with the latter making the former fall in love with her , and then having to shrug him off as part of a social experiment , only to find herself really loving him instead . In Fool's Gold , our couple reunites , with Kate Hudson's Tess going down deja-vu avenue in wanting to divorce husband Finn , played by McConaughey because she just had enough of his lack of keeping to promises , which even a fantastic sex life couldn't help . It's no surprise that movies such as Fool's Gold continue to be made , and the formula is pretty no brainer as well . Put in some tempting opportunity for prospecting sunken treasure in the depths of the seas from some aged old ship , smack together good looking leads ( so that they can get away with everything , including a bad story ) who don't mind bearing their bodies in trunks of bikinis for the most parts of the movie , and pour in plenty of water , jokes , and goon type characters as baddies . Finn , as a hero , is almost always bumming through life , and making the wrong deals with the wrong kinds of persons . His latest expedition , while managing to gain small results , offends his financier Bigg Bunny ( Kevin Hart ) , who's after his hide for making him lose money . His soon to be ex-wife works as a stewart onboard the luxury yacht of multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt ( Donald Sutherland ) , who soon finds himself charmed by the couple's enthusiasm and passion for treasure hunting , and backs them in their latest quest to locate the lost treasure known as the Queen's Dowry , where 40 chests of jewellery with emeralds and rubies the size of a human fists . And the quest is not made easy when there's competition in the form of Moe Fitch ( Ray Winstone without CGI to buff him up to Beowulf proportions ) , and Big Bunny's goons with an injection of foreign talent . For some parts , this looked like National Treasure without the location jet-setting and the cryptic clues . There's a hidden treasure somewhere that our heroes have to dig deep from clues provided from the past , in knowing characters , their histories and motivations , and of course with goons constantly hot on their heels doing things the easier way without working the brains . However , Fool's Gold had loaded itself with too many characters in its ensemble , and as it expectedly turns out , everyone else besides Hudson and McConaughey are in supporting , one dimensional caricatures . You have a rapper and his posse , a pair of gay chefs , rival treasure plunders with history going way back , and a tycoon and his daughter whom he's trying to connect with . If I should choose my favourite character amongst all of them , it's gotta be that bimbotic heiress ( Alexis Dziena ) probably cloned from Paris Hilton's genes . In fact , some of her lines are so genuinely stupid , that they somehow turn out really hilarious , and the delivery by that wide-eyed ing√©nue , clueless face , gave those lame jokes an added boost . Standard action adventure fare with predictable outcome . Don't go into this movie expecting anything more , or you'll be making a foolish choice .
515033	317399	816437	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Bloody Tie	Bloody Tie was my last movie for this year's Singapore International Film Festival , and although it's an action movie , I thought it ended my festival this year with a whimper rather than with a bang . Set in the time of the IMF ( not the Mission Impossible one ) making loans to a South Korean economic collapse , the populace begins to turn to drugs for their bit of escapism . The worst hit city with plenty of drug addicts happen to be Busan , and for drug dealer Sangdo , this presents opportunity to make it to the big league . On the other side of the law , narcotics police detective Lieutenant Do , known for his unorthodox and violent prone techniques , takes Sangdo under his wing as his informal snitch . But as all things go , it's a black eat black world , with cop and drug dealer striking up an uneasy partnership , each with their own agenda to leach on the other for their own selfish reasons , in their common quest to take down the new and current drug lord . Sounds like good stuff ? That's what I thought too , until the pacing switched me off for the most parts . It's full of verbal bravado , and plenty of supporting characters adding absolutely nothing to further the story . Its runtime of almost 2 hours was not justified , and some sections could have been cut short to quicken things up . One of the few saving graces is its black humour , but other than that , it's pretty serious and sombre . If you're interested , stay tuned until the end of the credits . But given the late night , the projectionist was too trigger happy to shut the projector off halfway through the scene . Pity .
514468	317399	477347	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Night at the Museum	Night of the Museum is this year's Chicken Little . With the trailer played almost every time before a movie is screened , it's arguable that this is probably the most watched movie trailer for the year , with that T-Rex skeleton taking a sip from the water cooler , made the iconic scene for the film , taking over Chicken Little doing its rendition of " the running man " . Given its marketing muscle , it'll work two ways - live up to its hype , or gets buried in it when it fails to deliver , given its continuous build up of expectations . Night at the Museum treaded dangerously close to the latter . Fans of Ben Stiller , myself included , will definitely not miss this movie . There's this tinge of zaniness in his movies and characters , and most of his comedic films never fail to crack me up . I reckon at least one scene in every movie will have me ended up in stitches with tears rolling . Sadly , this was not to be for Night at the Museum . It's a pretty ordinary role about a very ordinary quitter , who can't seem to hold down a regular job , and is faced with losing respect from his son , now living with his estranged wife . So as the story goes , he gets a job as the sole night watchman of the Museum of Natural History , and as you would already know , it's a kids fantasy as inanimate objects and statues all come to life when the sun goes down . At its heart , this is a children's movie , through and through , having caricatures for villains , and situations which are deemed very family friendly , which suits its target audience to a T . It's filled with top notch special effects and costumes to bring history to life , but again it's nothing groundbreaking about it . The storyline is rather plain and almost buried itself under ultra predictable plot lines , which is a pity because it had some great supporting cast , like Robin Williams , who was surprisingly very muted and restrained , Dick Van Dyke , Mickey Rooney , Ricky Gervais , Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan , the latter two playing combative , bickering figures from different eras who are in constant battle for more territory . To thoroughly enjoy this , bring along a kid , or allow the kid inside you some leeway to take over your emotions for a while . Otherwise , this movie will be a tad tough to sit through without constantly checking your watch . Hope the next Ben Stiller project will be much better .
515257	317399	259324	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Ghost Rider	Mark Steven Johnson , I hate to break it to you . 3 strikes and you're out . I understand your earnestness in trying to write-direct Marvel superhero movies by trying to stay close to the source material , but somehow they all turn out to be mediocre efforts . Although you didn't direct Elecktra , you produced and wrote it , and wrote-directed Daredevil and now Ghost Rider . I enjoyed Daredevil even though most others did not , and that unfortunately was your best effort . Marvel superheroes have their fair share of material being translated to the big screen , the largest cash cow being Spiderman , which opened the doors for efforts like The Hulk and Fantastic Four , creations of Stan Lee , and others , which I deem on the lower echelons , like Daredevil , Punisher , and Ghost Rider . The floodgates have not closed , as Spiderman and Fantastic Four will spawn their sequels this year , with Iron Man coming our way as well . Naturally not all the movies are hits , and too bad , I had hopes for Ghost Rider to join the hit list , even though I've not faithfully followed the comic books nor am a fan . I'm not quick to dismiss that comic book material can't be turned into powerful motion pictures . Batman Begins and the Spiderman movies have earned their mark of respect for having that emotional oomph to engage the audience , coupled with effects and stunts to wow . I guess we're spoilt from the excellent efforts of Christopher Nolan and Sam Raimi , as they've raised the bar and their movies are now the de facto benchmarks for comic book adaptations to reach . The first sign that things aren't going all that well , was that this movie was postponed , if I recall correctly , for almost one year , on the pretext of jazzing up the special effects . True , the flames on the skull were as realistic as can be , but that's about it . Every other effect seemed quite ordinary , and nothing to make the jaw drop . In fact , some CGI shots became so repetitive , that you start to wonder if the same clip was being recycled to save time . In essence , much like the origins of Daredevil , Johnny Blaze ( Nicolas Cage ) unwittingly signs a pact with the devil Mephistopheles ( Peter Fonda ) , and indirectly caused the death of his father . Blaming himself , and because of the sale of his soul to the devil , he abandons all hope in life , and his true love Roxanne ( Eva Mendes ) , and leads a dangerous life as a stunt biker who throws caution to the wind , knowing that he can't perish because of his secret " guardian angel " , and awaits the day when he can be free from fear and blame . Fast forward to the quick introduction of the main villain Blackheart ( Wes Bentley ) , son of the devil , who recruits the Elementals ( Earth , Wind and Water spirits of sorts ) in his cause to bring hell on earth . Yes , it's Constantine all over again . The plot was too vanilla plain , lacking much conflicts to challenge our anti-hero , besides his love interest . The villains , especially the Elementals , were a joke , and were so easily dispatched , that you'll scream for your money back . Given that it's an origin story of sorts , you'll get to see how Johnny becomes the rider who can walk on both worlds , and slowly get introduced to how he got his tools of the trade , including his jacket , gloves , chain , bike and shotgun . Unfortunately , one of the Rider's powers , the Penance Stare , is overused , and to cinematic audiences , we've probably seen a similar version in Alex Proyas ' directed The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee . While there are some remotely funny moments , most of the time the humour seemed contrived , and you'll probably cringe at some of the cheesy Western reference , no thanks too to one of the tracks performed by Spiderbait . If you're on the lookout for Stan Lee , who frequently pops into the Marvel films , don't . I think by steering clear , it's another indication that well , perhaps it's not as good a job as it should be . The narrative sagged in the middle , and contained some illogical , lazy plot moments , like a public transformation , and a busy jail house with no cops ( yeah right ) . Nicolas Cage could have been Superman with a hairpiece , but I thought he looked good as Johnny Blaze with a hairpiece . To his fans , you would've already seen the acting range he showed here , especially from John Woo's Face Off . That crazed look with the eyeballs almost popping out is repeated here , and at times , his Castor Troy scene comes to mind . Eva Mendes was largely wasted as the buxomy Roxanne who cock teases Johnny , and you actually wonder what Wes Bentley is doing in a movie like this . Sam Elliot shows up as the Caretaker , and is actually involved in a pretty cool scene which you might have seen revealed in the trailer . All in all , I would still say an enjoyable movie if you don't compare to , or have seen some of the other movies which I've mentioned above . It should do well at the box office in the initial week , before word of mouth gets to it . Fans of Ghost Rider , I sure would like to hear your views if you've liked it , or not , because after all , the fans are the ones who hold their hero dear .
514469	317399	473444	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Curse of the Golden Flower	Zhang Yimou is desperate . Desperate for that elusive Oscar . In his third attempt to lift that statuette , he has stuck to the martial arts genre , still deciding to go headlong since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's ( CTHD ) win . For his previous attempts , he has utilized CTHD star Ziyi Zhang in both Hero and House of Flying Daggers ( HFD ) , and had resorted to casting big Asian stars like Jet Li , Tony Leung , Maggie Cheung , all of whom are known actors to the West , and the likes of Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro . Here , he dug deeper , and went to snag CTHD star , and another recognizable face Chow Yun-Fat , as well as ditching Ziyi Zhang for his original muse , Gong Li , in roles fit for royalty . Well actually , they are royalty in this Shakespearean inspired tragedy . Or should I call it comedy . The family of Chow as Emperor , Gong as Empress , and royal princes played by Jay Chou , Qin Junjie and Liu Ye , are as dysfunctional as can be . They scheme , they plot , they fight , they switch loyalties , they have deep dark secrets and huge skeletons in their closets . They have complex relationship problems of the paternal , maternal , brotherly , and you can probably name every issue from incest to heterosexual sex , they're all in it . These folks know how to love , but for all the wrong reasons , and in all the wrong ways . Someone should remind Zhang Yimou that story is key . Seducing audiences with costumes that show twin peaks , peekaboo moments , and having grand sets and massive foot soldiers running around , just can't cover up the lack of a strong story , and it lapsed into convenience of wrapping it up ala HFD with nonsensical , implausible ( maybe it's possible but I doubt ) plot elements . If you thought having HFD's extremely quick transition of the seasons bad , wait till you get a load of this , and its loopholes ( like one dealing with travelling time ) stuck out like a sore thumb . If you're expecting cool martial arts swordsplay , then I'm sorry , look elsewhere . The fights are few and far between , and nothing spectacular . Other than relying heavily on CG trickery , the fights are short of exciting , save for the first showdown at the beginning of the movie . It all went downhill after that , except for one scene where a funky weapon was wielded by one character . It brought back the memories of old Shaw Brothers martial arts flick where combatants wield the most interesting weapons like clubs and rakes , but this one takes the cake ! True to the theme , it's in gold too ! Despite its convoluted plot , which credit though , makes itself clear as the movie progressed , the actors are probably sleepwalking through their roles . Chow had little to do except be nasty ( and surprisingly , little screen time ! ) , Gong had to break out in sweat from her tight tube top , Jay looked extremely lost , while Liu Ye who played the Crown Prince , was portrayed as one horny bastard . The sets , while beautiful at first , gets tiresome after a while , especially the psychedelic palace decor which really will get to your nerves . This is truly a wannabe Banquet gone stale , and one wonders how much those gold plated stuff , if they're real , could have fetched on the market to make up for lost box office revenue once word gets out that it leaves a bad aftertaste . If there's any consolation , at least it's better than Chen Kaige's The Promise , and there's a scene here which is finger lickin ' good !
515297	317399	422861	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The OH in Ohio	The OH here refers to the female orgasm , and while some like to tout this as the female version of last year's hit comedy The 40-Year Old Virgin , I would beg to differ . Written and directed by Billy Kent , the only probably reason for the link between the two films is that both starred Paul Rudd , but of course , playing different characters . Appealing to obviously different groups , The Oh in Ohio , while it has its rib tickling moments , is nowhere as hilariously insane as The 40 Year Old Virgin . Parker Posey is no Steve Carrell , even though their characters have their lack of sex being something in common . Posey's character Priscilla Chase is one of the most gorgeous woman of her time , but unfortunately for her as she finds out , she had never had an orgasm , even though her husband , Jack ( Paul Rudd ) has one of the more impressive guns around town , as ascertained by his student Kristen ( Mischa Barton , from the OC ) . While Virgin had its focus trained on that one man who hasn't got laid , OH in Ohio sets its sights on how the Chase husband and wife settle their differences . To her , her frigidity was identified as a cause for her lack of the big-O , but for him , it's a different story altogether as it's a direct impact on his big fat male ego in being unable to satisfy his wife . From then on , the story tangents off in two separate directions , with Priscilla and her quest to cum , and Jack on his journey of self-assurance . Part of the fun here belonged to the expanded cast , like Heather Graham has the lesbian sex shop owner , and Liza Minnelli as a sex guru , in what could probably be one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie . Danny DeVito , I thought he uttered one line from Batman Returns , was probably the most underdeveloped character as Wayne the Pool Guy , though he played an important role as adviser and confidante . However , the rest are pretty much throw away characters . Mischa Barton's role too was nothing more than a cock-tease . To bring on more laughs , there were senseless scenes on the ( ove ) reliance on devices , sexual and otherwise , though that was counter-balanced with some pretty raunchy-witty dialogue . My only gripe is that The OH In Ohio ended in an anti-climax . Just as you thought the lead characters had built up and developed , and are expecting some fireworks between them , it ended off with quite a limp , leaving you just as unsatisfied as Priscilla was prior to her transformation .
514809	317399	792965	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Hunting and Gathering	It's Audrey Tautou , and ever since Amelie , I am of the opinion that Singaporeans have an affinity for the pint sized actress , and her box office draw here is fairly strong . Count me in as one of the fans who will lap up her cinematic outings , good or bad , so long as our heroine gets the opportunity to shine on screen . Hunting and Gathering is based on a novel by Anna Gavalda , and tells the story of four individuals whose lives converge in an apartment . In this movie directed by Claude Berri , I thought that it was split into 3 acts , with story arcs focused on the challenges faced by each of the characters . Tautou stars as Camille Fauque , a near anorexic surface engineer who smokes a lot , guzzles alcohol , but eats very little . Living alone in a small attic of an apartment block , she meets Philibert ( Laurent Stocker ) , a fellow neighbour who suffers from bouts of anxiety . Philibert's housemate Franck ( Guillaume Canet ) is a chef who lives hard and fast , whose only worry is the welfare of his grandmother Paulette ( Francoise Bertin ) , a senior citizen who fears being tossed aside by kin , and makes life quite difficult for her caretakers . The narrative is quite plain actually , with every conceivable development being very predictable . That means no quirky twists and turns for the sake of it , and it actually allows you to shift to lower gears to enjoy this outing . It's a story about having dreams , fulfilling them , and helping others to fulfill theirs too , through encouragement and support rendered . Having all four characters together under one roof , though brief it might be , did seem like an episode of Friends gone all French and all whacked with the age grouping , and proving correct the adage that two's a company and three's a crowd . It did try to cover a lot of ground given that there are a number of characters here , but it did so at the expense of depth . The romance entanglements between characters did seem rather superficial , bland , trivial and predictable , while Philibert's quest to stem out his stammering through stage acting unfortunately had to take the backseat , and thus having his character fade away somewhat for the last act of the movie . The most meaningful and beautiful arc here belongs to Francoise Bertin's Paulette , as her tale of fear of abandonment rings through very honestly , and somehow , you'll start to wonder when you're of old age , whether you will have companions whom you can get along with , or be forgotten and tossed to some old folks ' home to spend your twilight years in . I felt that it was superiorly poignant , without which there would be no emotional anchor for this movie . Somehow , movies that feature food and classy restaurants ( Ratatouille , Mostly Martha and No Reservations anyone ? ) of late that I've watched always have fallen into the clich√©d ending . I'm unsure if it's an unwritten rule to have it done so , or if it's a formula that has proved to work every time . But in all earnestness , I thought it ended quite nicely with that happily ever after feel . In summary , definitely worth a watch for the eye candy cast , but it plays like a generic romantic / friendship tale that possesses potential that was hardly scratched .
514738	317399	415978	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Me and You and Everyone We Know	Written and directed by Miranda July , Me You and Everyone We Know is an indie film that has gone on to win several film awards around the world . It finally opens in the theatres here , but it's difficult to see what the fuss is all about . Miranda plays one of the two major leads , Christine , in a community tale with an ensemble cast of minor characters . Her role as a contemporary artist looking for her break and earning a livelihood driving an " Eldercab " , spews too many philosophical lines and basks herself in many contrived situations , and gets herself involved romantically in an unconventional manner with Richard ( John Hawkes ) , a shoe salesperson recently separated from his wife and tried his hand ( pardon the pun ) at self-immolation . The Everyone We Know here refers to the ensemble cast in the movie , ranging from Richard's younger son dabbling innocently in internet romance / online sex , the elder son who got lucky when 2 arguing teenagers wanted to know who gives the better blow job , a little girl preparing her dowry in 20 years time when she marries , her mother whom she seldom sees , to Richard's colleague at work who teases with the 2 teenagers , and the list goes on . Basically it refers to the neighbours they live with , and the very limited degrees which separate them . In my opinion , it's actually quite an ordinary movie about the ordinary lives of ordinary people , but perhaps therein lies its charm . It's not the usual romance filled storyline between Christine and Richard , nor are the relationships between any of the characters the usual clich√©s that you'd come to expect . Not that it's dry , but it's quite different . However the movie does have its moments , and somehow I enjoyed the stalker like instances when Christine courts Richard , the dowry made up of everyday household items stored in the chest of Hope , and of course the more risqu√© bits , especially the one where the identity of the online sex chat partner is finally revealed , and you'd get to see the reactions of both parties when they meet up . Pure unadulterated magical moment , if I could say so . And the gag which really cracked me up , was an innocent quip about this " back and forth " smiley : ) ) < > ( ( You got to watch the movie and find out for yourself what it means .
515345	317399	43587	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Ginza Cosmetics	The opening shots of this movie firmly puts it in the Ginza district of Tokyo back in 1951 , with its distinct landmark of the Clock Tower , and serves kind of like a documentary snapshot of the district with following the kid Haruo in and around the area , before finally we get to meet his mom Yukiko ( Kinuyo Tanaka ) , a bar hostess struggling to make ends meet . Directed by Mikio Naruse , this movie doesn't have any big moments , and feels like a capture of the relatively mundane life of Yukiko , in her luckless meeting with various men who seem always to disappoint , and her taking care of her only son . These are acute observations that represent that slice of life , and doesn't over-dramatize or wallow in melodrama and the theatrics , which is quite commendable , given the usual tendency for movies of the genre to lapse into . Things happen as a matter of fact , right up until the tense and anxious moments of looking for a runaway kid . Kinuyo Tanaka brings forth a quiet , stoic demeanour in her Yukiko , being unable to change her fate of being a single mother , and she could make you wring your heart as we experience together with Yukiko a potential moment of probably romance with a young man flit away , despite initial reluctance to get acquainted and help out in his stay in Tokyo . I thought it was quite magnanimous of her to do what she did , and felt that it was really sad for one to resign to her fate without any inclination to challenge it with the hope that things might be for the better . If you prefer your movies quiet , with the dignified presence of a star actress at her element , then perhaps Ginza Cosmetics would be a launchpad for anyone interested in following the filmography of director Mikio Naruse , and of his many film collaborations with Kinuyo Tanaka .
515478	317399	475944	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Covenant	Don't think too much when watching this movie . That's my advice , but it worked as an excellent therapy right after surviving the horrendous local film Return to Pontianak . The Covenant is guilty pleasure , of watching something full of effects , zero storyline to think about , great looking cast and the usual fast cars and quick action . Alpha males will have another reason to rejoice , given the leading characters come from the so-called elite of the community , nicknamed " The Sons of Ipswich " for their founding fathers ' efforts in building the town they live in . All of them are your usual good looking hunky frat boys , with fast cars , and cute chicks in tow . However , our gang of four harbour a deep secret , that each of them have supernatural powers that they can use for whatever they want , and how they want . The only catch is that with each use of their powers , they will physically age . So , do you wanna trade good looks , for absolute power ? But of course , the Book of Damnation ( gee ) instills certain rules , and introduces the audience to hokey witchcraft and imagined mysticism . Naturally no one's interested in that stuff , except to watch with glee how our frat boys will ( ab ) use their powers . It's addictive , you know , having such abilities , and given the mysticism added in , it's no longer the drugs , nor the sex , nor the rock and roll that get these boys going , but the addiction of being omni - potent in place of power , wealth and fame . The leader of the pack , as per all juvenile stories , is the most powerful of the lot , and preaches time and time again on the virtues of restraint . Until one day the team faces an unexplainable disturbance in The Force ( oops , wrong movie , but you get the drift ) , and have to discover just exactly what the disturbance is . No honours will go towards acting abilities , and I feel those in the audience with strong sense of feminism will go up in arms about how the lead female character is portrayed . You know , the one who will go weak in the knees for the hottest looking guy and literally and blatantly flings herself at him . The guys too fare no better , always trying to ooze machismo and drip testosterone at every opportunity , and enjoy replicating Underworld-styled leaping off rooftops . For a movie like this , there are no efforts spared in jazzing up the special effects . While on the whole it's all good , there are portions of it which made scenes look like extended screen versions of the video game Street Fighter , and taking a leaf too from Asia's StormRiders ( Feng Yun ) in creating battle scenes . You know it's time for formula , when fights are choreographed according to an alternative rock soundtrack . While the action is good , the pacing of the movie could be improved loads . It couldn't decide whether it wanted to be mysterious , horrific , reliant on action or wanting to take its romantic bits seriously . It seemed that director Renny Harlin had a lot of ideas for the feel of the movie , but couldn't decide which to put focus on , and in the end , threw everything into the pot for a mix . It's like an all boys " The Craft " , also set in school , except that their powers are inherited , and the story examines what's it like to use power with a price . If you need something to immerse yourself to forget about a hard day's work , then The Covenant probably is your choice . Oh , and this is one movie in which the trailer tells the whole damn story .
515291	317399	338679	6.0	A Nutshell Review : A Class To Remember IV : Fifteen	I'm not too sure why Gakko III wasn't selected for the festival . It could be that it was too much of the same with its teacher-student-school trinity . Or probably the subject matter wasn't diverse enough for it to be differentiated for an audience already seen the first two , and still being fresh in the minds . And Gakko IV - Fifteen , is very much different from the first two Gakko movies , in that it is not set within the confines of a school compound . Rather , this movie has legs , given that it's a road movie , and has its protagonist , 15 ( obviously ) year old Daisuke ( Yuta Kanai ) running away from home to go on the road , in search of a 7000 year old Cedar tree in Yakushima island . Road trips stick to a formula , that you will encounter strange , quirky people along the way ( that's what makes it interesting ) , and somehow have your lives touching each other's because Fate would only have it that way . You have the usual unfriendly bunch , and portrayals of those whom you will also like to meet up with , should you embark on a road trip yourself . Thumbing and hitchhiking his way , with little money and possession , Daisuke totally hates school , and this is something that any teenager could identify with . But don't forget , Life , or living Life , is probably the best school there is . Throughout his journey , Daisuke meets up with people whom he will affect ( for the better ) , and vice versa . The most memorable , and probably having the longest screen time devoted , will be his meeting with a woman trucker ( Rei Asami ) , who , out of pity and curiosity , brings Daisuke home to provide him with temporal shelter and food . How Daisuke affected her family , with his bonding and bringing out the reclusive son , somehow worked wonders and cemented the theme of friendship in this story . At the end of the day , personal relationships get healed , and one of the most touching moments was the expected run in with his family , especially his dad , at the end of the unannounced journey . That scene alone , with its relatively quiet moments , with subtle gestures , and almost muted feelings of regret , is very powerful indeed . That scene alone , is a worthy finale , and worthwhile in investing time to watching this .
514664	317399	490086	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Big Stan	The only other movie I remember vividly with the protagonist fearing his upcoming time spent in jail , was in Spike Lee's powerful drama 25th Hour , where we follow Edward Norton's character in his final day of freedom before being sent to the slammer . In Big Stan , Rob Schneider's crooked time-share conman Stan got arrested in the opening minutes for fraud ( and you might think it's for racism ) , and spends much of the first act mulling over the fear of getting raped in jail , for not being part of any gang , and a first timer wussy who's easy target for the lonely tough guys behind bars . Thanks to his crooked lawyer Lew Popper ( M . Emmet Walsh ) and the crooked system ( from the judiciary right down to the prison warden , who as the movie states , are always made to look like dicks anyway ) , he gets six months off before he has to present himself to the courts to begin his sentence , in in this period of time , tries his best to look " undesirable " . Help comes in the form of The Master , played to good campy effect by David Carradine , star of the 70s Kung Fu series , whom I last saw in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies playing well , yet another stereotyped kung fu master . Thus begins the tried and very tired formula of the kooky training regime with strange food and diet , coupled with near impossible feats like titty-weight training . Granted there were some genuine sight gags , but sad to say they all get confined to this particular sequence . The trailer would have already spelt it all out for you , and suffice to say that the best bits were already inside . The story by Josh Lieb seemed to have run out of steam even before the mid-way mark , where Stan had already entered the jailhouse , and asserted his tougher than tough , no nonsense , keep away demeanour by punching the lights out of the meanest rapist in jail , and a few others . If you're looking for end to end laughter , then you're likely to be bored once Stan becomes head honcho in getting some respect in jail . With that out of the way , the movie degenerated into series of clich√©s , and the usual nasty warden with nasty plan routines . It didn't help that supporting characters here were stereotyped into playing stereotypes , conveniently split into the different cliques and clans . Directed by Rob Schneider himself , his films to date has somewhat been of a hit and miss for me . Lending his prowess to supporting roles like in You Don't Mess With The Zohan and Click , I thought he usually fared better in those , unlike having to carry the movie solely on his own , ala Deuce Bigelow and The Benchwarmers . What I found out unfortunately is that they usually start off strongly with quite a unique premise ripe for the cracking of some insane jokes , before fizzling out halfway and coasts through some predictable drama to the finale . Still , some laughs are better than none at all , so if you really feel that you need some light hearted medicine , then you'll find some joy in the beginning , but that's all .
514581	317399	494834	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Silk	If Fate would have it , I would have the opportunity to go to Tokyo for this year's Japanese International Film Festival , and watched this as the closing film . Initially I had mixed this up with Atonement , also starring Keira Knightley in a period romance story , except that this one had shades of The Last Samurai thrown in , with the love triangle moments with the involvement of a Japanese girl . Based on the novel by Alessandro Baricco , Silk takes its name from the Silk trade , where a French village looks to having its economy hit , if not for Alfred Monlina's Baldabiou who ventures into opening a silk mill and employing the townsfolk . However , in need of untainted silkworm eggs , free from an epidemic striking Europe , he sends overseas one of his staff Herve Joncour ( Michael Pitt ) , whom is indebted to him for arranging his marriage with Knightley's Helene , and off he goes on the arduous journey first to Africa , then to the land of the rising sun , now in the impending stage of internal strife . The journeys are probably the best bits in the movie , with lush landscapes filling the screen in all serenity of the turmoils that are yet to come . I thought director Francois Girard tried to ape Terence Mallick's direction , with lush natural beauty punctuated with voice over narration of the character's inner-most thoughts . We learn a lot of what's going on in Herve's mind , as he tells us the story of his being , and the conflict he faces when he gets tempted to committing adultery , never forgetting about his tryst overseas when back home he has a lovely wife to go home to . While the movie has that central conflict that provides the fuel to propel the movie forward , somehow it never gets utilized , having the story and characters dance around on the sidelines of the issue , never to take it head on . This adds to the frustration of watching the deliberations that they have , made worse as the movie chooses to unfold itself extremely slowly , taking too much of its own sweet time . Fans of Keira Knightley would have watched this movie solely to see her performance after the Pirates double bill , but sadly , even though she's given top billing , her screen time is limited , as the spotlight falls on Michael Pitt's Herve and we are told of this story through his eyes . What adds to the annoyance as well , is that the movie is sans English subtitles . Having it set in France but the characters speaking in English is understandable ( after all , Pitt is American and Knightley is English ) , but having the Japanese speak in their native tongue , and not providing the subtitles , removes a layer that would have provided probably a deeper understanding of the movie . Yes , granted we are supposed to feel the pain of Herve in his inability to connect with the people and the one he loves , but I don't feel that this should be done at the expense of understanding , especially for non-Japanese speaking folks . However , despite its obvious flaws , the movie redeems itself with a powerful end , packing quite a punch especially when you think it's headed nowhere and probably into mediocrity . Suddenly you discover that things are again not always what they seem , and wonder just who the bigger fool is . But the bottomline , if there's a message to be taken away from this movie , is again never to give in to temptation , and truly treasure your loved ones . Tried and tested , clich√©d but true .
514946	317399	416508	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Becoming Jane	Julian Jarrold gave us Kinky Boots in 2005 , and now helms something I thought of as more solemn in tone with the biographical tale of literary legend Jane Austen in Becoming Jane , starring Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy in yet another period dramatic piece since Atonement . Here , they play star crossed lovers who get embroiled with the rigidity of class , honour and reputation back in Old England , with him being a legal student , and she , a budding novelist , where at the time isn't a career choice ( if at all ) for a female . Sounds like Pride and Prejudice ? Yes . If the movie is to be believed , then the love and life of Jane Austen served very much as the basis and seed for the premise of that novel of hers , and for an audience , probably ample opportunity to soak in the scenes that ring a bell , and compare Hathaway's performance as Austen to Keira Knightley's performance as her created character Elizabeth Bennet . The two characters couldn't be more alike , with one being almost an autobiographical account of the life she's facing as a single woman of marriageable age , and what more , being wooed by a Mr Darcy equivalent in Tom Lefroy ( James McAvoy ) . Also , the tale moved along quite similarly to that of Miss Potter , which tells of the story of the creator of Peter Rabbit , where we're plunged headlong into the critical crossroads of their professional life as well . Or like that of Finding Neverland , yet another adaptation of the life and times of JM Barrie , who gave us Peter Pan where inspiration is as chronicled in the movie . I thought Anne Hathaway finally got a meatier , more mature role here , and what more , starring as a legend too in Jane Austen . However , I can't deny that her faux pas English accent was found somewhat wanting and proved to be a distraction of sorts . She did manage , though , to bring out the pain that Jane had to go through in having to hold out on love , find it , lose it , like the adage says , better to have loved once and lost than never at all . James McAvoy's performance here is a notch below that which he delivered in Atonement , probably because it's something that has already been done to death ( not another Mr Darcy clone ! ) . The last 10 minutes was a kick too in seeing how visibly aged the characters become , thanks to wonderful make up . Other than that , sit tight for a romantic drama which as I mentioned , had much ado about Pride and Prejudice , that at times you might lapse into thinking it is that movie that you're watching .
515525	317399	408345	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Firewall	I was quite surprised that Massive Attack's Angel was chosen to accompany the opening credits , which consisted for mostly CCTV / voyeuristic shots of a team conducting surveillance on the movements of Harrison Ford's Jack Stanfield and his family . I know it's a cool track , but Angel is perhaps becoming one of the more overused tracks in Hollywood pictures already . But it hints well at what Firewall is going to become . Clich√© and overused sequences which will probably make you scream " haven't I seen this somewhere before " ? Firewall offered nothing very new in terms of plot outline , as it contains modified scenes from even Ford's own works like Air Force One ( the family's survival being threatened , and it's up to one man to save the day ) and The Fugitive ( the frame up and one man's run from the law ) . Ford has already become comfortable in the role of an all-American one man hero , that this role offered no surprises at all . It's basically standard fare with the usual chases and action fight sequences . Stansfield is a VP of ( network ) security of a bank , and has designed the bank's software , with other operational duties like making sure the bank can respond to external online threats . However , as the saying goes , almost 80 % of intrusion are committed knowingly or unknowingly from the inside , and with a head honcho part of the act , you can be sure that he has the know-how to siphon out cash if he wants to . In comes Bill Cox ( Paul Bettany ) , scheming con man , who with his team of merry men , take Stanfield's family hostage and lapses into the usual psycho-mumbo-jumbo routine . With the family's antics at escaping , you really wonder if Cox , as a villain , has what it takes to call the shots in a hostage situation . While he might have the upper hand , it's his weakness in being ruthless to the hostages that proved his downfall , and make him a very weak cinematic villain . Here's someone who would rather shoot at his own men than to teach them hostages a lesson . Probably he has this noble subscription to " women and children first " . And it doesn't help when there's the usual good guy amongst his merry men who offers the family sympathy points . Word of caution though , for those who might think that this film offers some cool technology on screen . Leave the techno-babble at the door , there's no " firewall " to hack into in the first place , and the " hacking " is actually a no-brainer . And unless the USA offers wireless internet access like everywhere , it's pretty incredible with what a laptop can do in the movie . It has your expected twists and seemingly smart moments , but nothing that will truly make you go " wow " . The fist fight choreography can get pretty intense , however , there's no need to reach the end of the road before you know who's gonna emerge tops . It isn't exactly a bad movie , but one which doesn't even have a single sequence that can redeem this picture from really bad mediocrity .
515329	317399	467197	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Max Payne	For starters , don't be a dweeb and start heading out the door when the end credits roll . If you deem that the movie didn't have proper closure since there are additional folks who didn't get their due Payne justice , then this scene at the end with Mila Kunis playing the Devil's Advocate , will probably make some amends to what is essentially a relatively generic detective drama . My first experience with the Max Payne game was by chance in a cybercafe . Back then , Counter-strike was all the rage , but having been thrown out of a server , I was poking around the computer's desktop , and noticed the game icon . My first impression after surviving all five minutes of it in the subway shootout , was that it allowed anyone who wanted to be Chow Yun-fat in a John Woo movie , play out their fantasy in full slow-motion glory . It was one that spewed plenty of blood , but more gratifying to a gamer , was how varied and massive the firepower was . How did the movie fare ? Well for those looking for the same all-out wall to wall action , you might have to be patient until the hour mark before things really start to heat up . Even then , it takes a lot more set action pieces before you get to the money shots as seen in the trailer . Good thing though that director John Moore didn't go overboard with all the slow motion madness the trailers would have led you to believe . Then again , this made the action stick to the formula of body counts , unlimited rounds , and an almost indestructible hero . Those who are worried that Max Payne will be turned into John Constantine , can put their fears to rest . In fact , most of those winged angels don't serve much purpose in the movie , except to give the visual effects and the computer graphics guys a job to do . It's actually quite unnecessary except to throw up red herrings when you try and figure out what function they serve , and then it will dawn on you that it's for stylistic purposes and not substance . The opening of Max Payne made it look like it plagiarized that from Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity . And in fact , given the look and scowl on Damon in The Bourne Ultimatum's poster , he does look like a doppelganger of Mark Wahlberg , and both of them could probably interchange roles since all that is required , is a permanent scowl . As the character goes , Payne is out kicking down doors looking for the murderer of his wife and child . And this is essentially a one-man show easily dispatching countless of faceless , emotionless and pretty clich√© ( think The Fugitive type ) villains . What I thought could have been frowned upon , especially when the morally right go up in arms to condemn the movie for its violence , would be what seemed like a condonment of drug use , never mind if it was used for survival purposes , because it made it seem like drugs make you tough and fearless . Supporting female characters get turned into your classic flower vases , and I seriously think that newly minted Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko should start to look for more variety in the roles that she plays , rather than the usual vampish Russian who doesn't hesitate in shedding her clothes for the screen and wanting to bed the hero . While she's largely forgettable here , Mila Kunis ' role as Mona Sax would likely be the meatier one , but alas I suspect that most of her scenes got cut and left at the floor of the editing room . It's quite amazing though how a little goth makeup and loads of leather could transform her from friendly hotel front desk staff in Forgetting Sarah Marshall , to a character that has a penchant of popping up with no rhyme or reason . It's far from being a satisfactory game-turned-movie , mostly let down by the wafer thin plot that reeks of having been there and done that . Visually it's very beautiful to look at , with the constant gloomy nights punctuated with first snow . Fans of Wahlberg who are familiar with his bad-ass dude roles , would find that it's the same all over again , no matter if he's called Max Payne , Bob Lee Swagger , Dignam or Bobby Mercer .
514577	317399	486583	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Fred Claus	What if Santa Claus , aka Saint Nicholas actually had a family , and a brother who hates him to the core because of a high degree of envy ? The first 10 minutes spend time establishing its version of this " What If " scenario , even offering the notion of how immortality comes to play a part in freezing their ages so as to transplant Fred ( Vince Vaughn ) the older brother , to Today , while Santa is already operating his Santa's Workshop delivering presents to nice children in time for Christmas Day . To a bitter brother jealous of the attention and success of his sibling , Fred hating Christmas and Santa is an understatement . He despises everything that Santa stands for ( of course the true meaning of Christmas takes a backseat here , in case you're wondering ) , but when run into trouble , no doubt calls the only kin he's still on talking terms with . In order to better his lot and be able to pay off a rental for his dream shop , he takes up his brother's offer to work at the Workshop for 50 grand , thinking it's a piece of cake , until of course the unexpected appearance of Kevin Spacey's Clyde Northcut , an efficiency expert brought in by a mysterious Board to access Santa's operations , and if need be , shut it down - he's already proudly claiming credit for booting the Easter Bunny and scaling down the operations of the Tooth Fairy . This is not a comedy , contrary to how it's being marketed . Sure there are funny moments , but none to warrant any genuine ho-ho-ho's from you . Instead you can see the laughs coming from a mile away , and the delivery is a little tired . You get the same old Vaughn styled verbal barrage and cynical wisecracks , only that they're more of the same and you'd wish Vaughn would either summarize or come up with something new . Paul Giamatti as Santa looks the part thanks to the excellent make up and costume , but really , he's a tad underused in his role as Father Christmas . Plenty of recognizable supporting extras get thrown into the mix , but there's a strange pattern to their not being utilized to their utmost potential . It becomes almost like Spot the Stars , with Ludicrous as DJ Donny , Kathy Bates as Mom Claus , Miranda Richardson as Mrs Santa Claus , two shy lovers in John Michael Higgins ' Willie the Chief Elf and Santa's Little Helper ( Elizabeth Banks ) , but the surprise of them all has to be Rachel Weisz - just love her Brit accent ! Kevin Spacey plays a Lex Luthor type with hair , and I can't help but to groan at the forced reference to his Superman Returns stint . Other than that , the only good bits come from a truly hilarious sequence involving Frank Stallone , Stephen Baldwin and Roger Clinton in a Siblings Anonymous self-help group , and the gorgeously sounding Christmas Carols . The Silent Night heard towards the end of the movie , will be a tough one for sentimentalist out there to hold back the tears . The special effects too were well done , especially Santa's sleigh zooming into the night skies of countries around the world ( I could've sworn I saw the Singapore Skyline too ) , in a montage sequence that allows Fred , and the audience , to just take a step back to wonder should Santa be true , then it's a heck of a tough job , especially when the success of a single day hinges on how much you can do in the night before - going around the world , breaking and entering through the chimney , leaving wishes and presents behind , and not forgetting to munch on the cookies and milk left for you . It's a Christmas movie that doesn't offer much , with the last act saving this movie and giving it some credibility to qualify as a feel-good movie for the holiday season . No doubt it starts off quite nastily with so much drumming on rivalry and the green-eyed monster , but it redeems some moments with its take on brotherly love . Definitely not Vaughn's or Giamatti's best work , and on the whole , an average movie . Don't hold your breath if you're keeping the faith that the movie somehow turns out better than what its trailers suggest .
515563	317399	892767	6.0	A Nutshell Review : The Horsemen	I was gearing up for a good serial killer movie given the premise of having the four horsemen of the apocalypse , with the trailer piquing my interest from its fair share of unflinching blood and gore . Sad to say though that the distributors preferred to appeal to a wider audience for this , and some scenes were clearly butchered for its language , conversational content as well as snipping off some of the more gory moments of annihilation . I guess even the horsemen themselves are powerless when up against the censors ' scissors , which is the more potent weapon here . Dennis Quaid plays a pained cop Aidan Breslin , who has recently lost his wife and is growing increasingly distant from his kids Alex ( Lou Taylor Pucci ) and Sean ( Liam James ) , burying himself in and using work as an emotional crutch , never being there for family because work often calls out for his attention . And as the trailers would have pretty much revealed , the serial killer victims are all tortured with meat hooks of sorts , and he's faced with more than 1 killer who model themselves after the biblical Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse . Sounds like your average detective movie right ? I guess a memorable film from the genre like Se7en will only come once in a blue moon . This film by Jonas Akerlund tries to elicit similar moods devoid of humour and is all seriousness in tone , but its plot turned out to be quite flimsy thin , and those who have experienced enough of the genre , would have guessed the culprit for the last act somewhere by the mid-way point . No , it's not Ziyi Zhang ( as she is credited ) , and despite a major billing in the credits , her character Kristen turned out to be spoiled by the trailer already , coupled with the fact that she doesn't have more than 15 minutes worth of screen time in total . While this is one of her rare villainous outing with dialogue ( back in Rush Hour 2 she was struggling with English ) , I would have supposed that opposition to her character here as a villain was unfounded , given that they should have been more concerned with her sleepwalking through the role , and could have been replaced by any other lesser actresses since at best it's only a supporting role . Dennis Quaid however shows how he ages well into delivering stellar , lead performances , and makes it believable he's a man constantly struggling with a work-life balance . Ultimately , the message here is how important parents play in nurturing their children , and should be very much involved in their development , rather than thinking that cash would be a sufficient substitute and settle everything . The film does suggest , and probably had a subplot going for it , something like Japan's suicide pact clubs online , something which I thought could have been given an additional focus instead of leaving it open ended at that , just to show the extent of the " apocalypse " as being delivered by its messengers . Technically , one aspect which irked me , was how low the cropping turned out to be . I have read that there were constant boom mikes spotted in shots , so it could be a bad by-product of having to address that problem , in addition to ensuring that the printed Chinese subtitles are visible for the audience . So there were a lot of heads cut off at the foreheads during shot-reverse-shot conversational pieces , and various other medium to close up shots , that irritated the hell out of me . Horsemen had an interesting premise working for it , but alas didn't fulfill its potential in having to drop deeper themes for that frantic pace to the finishing line - which comparing to the run time at IMDb . com , we had 20 minutes shorn off here .
515233	317399	418455	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Adam's Apples	The premise of this movie seemed simple enough , about Neo Nazi called Adam ( Ulrich Thomsen ) being sentenced to community service at a church . A priest , Ivan ( Mads Mikkelsen ) , informs Adam that in order to complete his hours of service , he must have a goal in mind . And that goal actually turned out unexpectedly , as a passing remark , to be as banal as baking an apple pie , with apples found in the apple tree grown on the church's premises . Written and directed by Danish filmmaker Anders Thomas Jensen , Adam's Apples is a black comedy about God and the mysterious ways in which He works . Sometimes He does things in an indirect manner , in order for you to explore and find out exactly what He wants you to do . Or He might intent to pose some challenges in order to shake you up , or have a sublime message in which you are to learn from . Adam didn't have it easy , as in his opinion , it is as if God was punishing him by making things extremely difficult . Weird stuff kept happening with nary a warning , like having crows infest the tree and eating away at the apples , or by having worms invade from within . All these clue Adam that perhaps he wasn't meant to finish serving his time as soon as possible , but rather has to find meaning in the extended period of time of him being at the church . The story actually got more interesting when the audience is introduced to the host of quirky characters who seek refuge at the grounds , such as Khalid ( Ali Kazim ) the Pakistani with a thing for robbing petrol kiosks , and Gunnar ( Nicolas Bro ) , the fat kleptomaniac . And the plot actually allowed more to ponder upon , with the Bible playing a key plot device with its reference to the Book of Job - is there a modern biblical reference to Ivan , or is he living one himself ? But no worries about this portion of the plot getting too stifling for comfort . While it actually had a really dead serious mood throughout , there is plenty of comedy delivered , which came at times , fast and furious , but yet still maintained that deadpan feel , as if these comedic situations happened as " a matter of fact " - ly . Certain ( violent ) scenes stood out and made you think about how those shots were actually achieved . Watching the movie actually made me wonder about the existence of an omnipotent being , and actually had this uncanny feel good factor about it at the end . If you're up for some unconventional fare , then this nominee for this year's Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film might just be your cup of tea .
515507	317399	384537	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Silent Hill	Never cheese a mother off by taking away or threatening her child . We've seen plenty of tough mamas in contemporary movies , and Jodie Foster comes to mind in having personified the tough-as-nails mum in Panic Room and Flight Plan . NO , she doesn't have a part to play in Silent Hill , but the premise , about a mother on a journey to recover her daughter from the clutches of harm , couldn't be more familiar . And before you dismiss this movie as just another run off the mill video game adaptation , this movie is surprisingly good , in setting up its atmospheric moments . We've had plenty of misses with this genre , and only a few hits . Staying faithful to the setting of the source using CGI enhanced sets and SFX , it took its time to introduce the mystery surrounding Silent Hill , teasing you with long sequences which seem to journey nowhere . Which by then , some of you would have already given up , as you ache to see more of the beasts which go bump in the darkness , only to have an all too quick daylight interrupt the flow of carnage , and having to endure through long moments of silence and basically beating around the bushes . Then again , it's precisely this hide-and-seek that the movie stays an arm's length away from the usual expectation of action , action and more mindless action . Silent Hill is a very adult adaptation , staying true to the spirit of gaming , with its endless round after round of puzzles and encounters before everything starts to make some sense . Those expecting a splatterfest will be disappointed , as there aren't many . While the monsters and creatures are a sight to behold ( they're disgustingly beautiful ) , most times they get introduced and addressed too easily . Just as you get into the swing of things with a particular beast , it gets hauled away from view , whatever the reason . I dig the spasm-induced dancing faceless nurses , but they're given too little screen time . It's more mystery than downright horror , basing its theme on superstition and misguided faith on different planes . There're little " boo " moments , as everything builds up gradually , adding to the suspense . Eventually , you'll get to the closure , with the big mystery and back story unveiled , adding some gravitas to the movie , and could serve as a springboard to any sequels if planned . Radha Mitchell plays Rose Da Silva , the mom who partners cop Cybil Bennett ( Laurie Holden ) who assists her in the paranormal realm of Silent Hill to track down Sharon ( Jodelle Ferland ) , yet another creepy kid ( the other kid's the Anti-Christ in the remake of Omen . These days creepy kids are in ! ) who holds the key to the entire whodunnit . Sean Bean was wasted as Rose's husband , in a role that is created only because everyone else substantial in the movie is female . His role is actually to accentuate that Silent Hill exists on different realms , with him being in the " real world " while the others are trapped in another plane of existence . And of course in movies like these , the acting's nothing really to shout about , since expressions are limited to looking scared and looking bewildered . It'll take a while before you can scratch past to get to the storyline , as your eyes and attention will be peeling away the layers of beautifully crafted production sets and awesome graphics , and your ears appreciating the music adapted from the games . And with a satisfactory story as justification , this could perhaps see a new beginning to games wanting to make it to the silver screen , if done correctly .
514518	317399	409681	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Alibi	A dream service for those adulterous men and women out there . A service which takes your calls , handles all potentially tense situations of private eyes and that suspecting spouse , essentially taking care of you on the side while you bang . Sounds good ? I think so too , at least in a business sense . Ray Elliot ( Steve Coogan ) runs such a service . It's a money spinner , based on statistics that one in 4 men stray , and one in 10 women cheat . He advertises his risk management career through word of mouth , and takes pride in his job in bailing clients out of seemingly explosive marital situations . The pre-requisites ? A calm cool mind that can spin out stories and tell them with a straight face . Lola Davis ( the hot Rebecca Romijn ) is his new management recruit , and without much orientation , plunges into the job head on . Initially you might think the movie will develop on the above company politics scenario , and have the two leads get involved with each other romantically . But no , before you can get to see the next fling , the movie heads on to classic crime noir territory . On his last field job , Ray's client accidentally kills his mistress in a bout of S & M , and it's up to Ray to clear the mess up , violating one of his principles that his company doesn't provide alibis for crime . However his reputation and integrity is on the line , and he has no choice but to cover it all up . And you'll probably wince at the amount of challenges Ray goes through in having this done , and having a price put out on his head . It's essentially one heck of a caper , as we witness how Ray Elliot schemes and plot to get his rear out of situations that's seemingly impossible , and incredibly lucky to get out of . It's full of crossings and double-crossings , and while you might be lost at certain plot points , just hang in there as all will converge for the finale , leaving you with a smirk , quite satisfied with the outcome . What's fun in this movie is the huge ensemble cast that play the many characters on screen . Another X-Men franchise regular , James Marsden ( Cyclops ) is here as the inept himbo Wendell Hatch , Ray Elliot's last client , and we have a myriad of characters like hit men , gangsters , cops , an unsatisfied wife , etc from a cast of Selma Blair , James Brolin , Sam Elliot , Jaime King , John Leguizamo , Deborah Kara Unger , and the likes . One thing's for sure , having a huge network of those whom you have deposited emotional or material help with , certainly will help bucket-loads when the time comes . If you're up for a caper , then I'd recommend The Alibi , for its fun .
514724	317399	455195	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Divergence	Divergence is the latest crime thriller to come out of Hong Kong's film industry , and all films of this genre will nonetheless be compared with the grand-daddy of them all - Infernal Affairs , which set a very high bar . Given that this film is produced by the same team , you'd expect the same high standards . While production values are similar , I'd leave it to you to decide the end verdict . If you're expecting a strong cops and robbers storyline , then you might be disappointed . This film is heavy on relationships between the characters , their degrees of separation , and their duality . Which may not be a bad thing , but I find the dwelling on sappy moments and flashbacks a bit overboard , and at times , the audience was laughing at the improbability of these moments . This movie unites Aaron Kwok and Ekin Cheng together for the big screen after the comic fantasy movie Stormriders . Kwok plays a cop who lost his girlfriend under mysterious circumstances 10 years ago , and in the first 10 minutes , lost a key witness to a sniper , played by Daniel Wu , who always seem to be playing nothing but baddie roles these days . However , Wu's sniper character knows that in his career , he is both the hunter , and the hunted , and at times want to prove to Kwok that he makes a better cop . Ekin Cheng's a lawyer who defends the innocent , or so it seems . While he's aware that his clients are sometimes guilty , is he idly standing by ? Thrown into the mix are characters like Cheng's wife , played by the lovely Angelica Lee , who bears a strong resemblance to Kwok's girl , and thus making him a stalker of sorts , Eric Tsang as an underused pathologist , Ning Jing ( the only movie I saw her in was the remake of Shanghai Grand ) as a bald assassin agent , and Lo Kar Leung as Cheng's client who has shady underworld links and a pop star son , who gets kidnapped . At times you might feel that the movie plods along , while you might already have been able to unravel the mystery mid-way . This could be due to the sappy moments I mentioned earlier , and taking centerstage is how Kwok's cop character refuses to give up looking for his girlfriend . You can understand how the character feels if you're in the same shoes - loving someone so deeply , and yet having zero closure . And when you think you see her again - is it really her , or had amnesia played a part , or has she deliberately forgotten the past ? While the audience found the scene of revelation and Kwok's reaction to it funny , I felt the opposite - sometimes when the truth is revealed and you can't handle it , you shut down . Really . Trust me , I know . So if I were in his shoes , that'll probably be what will happen to me too . However , this film does have moments which can iconify it ( sort of like the Tony - Leung - pointing - a - gun - at - Andy - Lau's - head moment in Infernal Affairs ) . The " long run to the fish market " scene is tense , and so is the finale where 3 characters have a standoff , which actually yanked the rug off my feet . I felt that if this film focused tightly on the plot , and lose some peripheral characters , it might just live up to its potential , and I don't think we'll see any sequels to this one .
514571	317399	1213617	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Miss Gold Digger	The title says it all , about a woman who holds out from commitment because she's always in the hopes of snagging somewhere better , given the vast playing field out there from which to fish not only the rich , but in her own words , those with " money , future , power " . The cynical me wonders if this was the nail hit squarely on the head , that these are the secret underlying criteria these days before a woman would say yes . And if seeking out that someone would not be enough , as a guarantee , she even sows her own seeds , and cultivates her own venture with one of her longtime male friends . This is the story of Shin Mi-Su ( Han Ye-seul ) who when young dreams of being a real life Cinderalla , Snow White and Juliet , since after all their lovers were rich princes to boot . She's successful in her career in an ad agency , and with her gorgeous good looks , it provides an additional plus point naturally . But while she's pretty on the outside , she's really ugly on the inside , and this film chronicles how this duality and hypocrisy comes into play in almost all situations in her life . Han Ye-seul , who's up in the running for Best Actress in this year's AFFF , shows off her excellent acting with her two-faced , highly manipulative role , and does so effortlessly through her saucer eyes as they often betray ( for the audience's benefit ) her innermost thoughts and desires . Like Son Ye-jin's role in The Art of Seduction , Ye-seul's Mi-Su masters the art of seduction strategies in order to get her own way , or to obtain unfair advantages . If it's not money she's after , then it's the strings to be pulled one day . So who are those set in her sights ? Jun-seo ( Kwon Oh-jung ) the rich man looks like an automatic shoo-in with his expensive gifts , but his gruff exterior plants some doubts in her . It's not just enough to be loaded , but she wants to have the cake and eat it as well . Then there's the club rapper Hyeon-jun ( Son Ho-young ) who provides her the attention at the club , but that's just her fling at night when out having fun . And if you think a character like Mi-Su is desperate , look no further for proof than to entice her childhood friend Yun-cheol ( Kim In-kwon ) to pass the Bar exam and work his way up to District Attorney before she would even consider him as a life long partner , and goes all her way out in order to ensure that this plan succeeds . Which of course buys her time to look around for quicker ways to success of course . Then there's the new neighbour Dong-min ( Lee Jong-hyeok ) whom she starts off with the wrong footing , and always seem to be catching her at her worst behaviour . Her charms don't work , and this set up provides for some hilarious comic moments , which work because of Han Ye-seul's perfect timing . Given the limited scenes they act opposite each other , since her time is split rather evenly amongst all potential suitors , don't be expecting any great chemistry to be established . For all its feminist ra-ra with an alpha female in clear control over the exploitation of her sexuality and beauty , the film somehow retracts to romantic - comedy formula with some rather plain development mid way through the show , thereby leaving it devoid of any gravitas . Which means as a pure popcorn date movie , this works perfectly despite of its rather unresolved , open ending , that seems to echo some of the insecurities and indecisiveness that women perhaps face from time to time with regards to choosing , and whether they have made the right choice . So if you subscribe to what what this movie showcased , which is " money , fame and power " , then boys out there should better beware . 5Cs these days aren't enough , but the all encompassing three conditions spelt out , should .
515294	317399	202364	7.0	A Nutshell Review : A Class To Remember ( Gakko )	Gakko tells a simple heartwarming story of a group of students and their teacher , in one of the public night schools in Japan providing them education at the Junior High level . With night schools , you know that the students are working adults , and the narrative takes its time to dwell on the characters ' backgrounds , and their interactions with the teacher , how he helped them in their times of need , or simply being the beacon of hope for them . The first act does exactly that , and given its premise , I thought it was a dead-serious episode of Mind Your Language , minus the slapstick humour . There are hilarious moments , but nothing that tickles your funny bone until you cry tears of laughter . It was one of the more standard techniques used , with the premise set during the class ' graduation , and the final assignment being an essay documenting their thoughts about graduation . You have a diverse group of students , ranging from an elderly immigrant restaurant operator from Korea , a delinquent teenager , and a sleepy-head , amongst others , as flashbacks provide necessary background information on how they got to the class , forming the basis of an introduction to the characters . In the second act , it is a departure from memorable moments , to one of remembrance and tribute to a fellow student who had passed on . And it is this portion which lent a certain gravitas to the story , with plenty of heartfelt scenes about how an old man challenges incredible odds against his gaining an education . If I were an elderly man , then perhaps this character's never say die attitude , would have rubbed off onto me . The flute soundtrack / score was beautiful , and repetitive enough to make it stick to your mind after the movie ends . Cinematography again is simple , and you wonder if the zen inspired minimalist look and feel is opted for Gakko . You can't help but to notice a stark difference between this movie , and the slew of Hollywood contemporaries belonging to similar genres . While Gakko is quiet contemplation and reflection for the most parts , its recent peers are more flashy , more colourful and lively . The students too are portrayed differently . Contemporaries would lap at them about having serious issues that prevented them from excelling in school or have this " Me Against The World " mentality , but the Gakko students , while they have issues , are portrayed in a more positive light in terms of attitudes towards learning and life in general . However , the films all agree on something , that an inspirational teacher is all it takes to whip a class of misfits to shape .
514757	317399	1182972	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Bachna Ae Hasseno	Ranbir Kapoor in his debut leading man role as Ranbir in Saawariya , didn't have the luck to snag the lady of his dreams , maybe because he was kind of a cad too , where karma had a part to return and haunt him . In his second feature film here , his Raj Sharma is again a cad , and credits himself being a " lady killer " , able to woo any woman when he turns on his charms . We journey with him as he learns the true meaning of romance and love , and the first half of the movie before the intermission , gives the audience three situations over the course of 11 years where he toys with the emotions of different girls , broadly the sweet , sexy and sassy type , until of course , Karma catches up with him again for that all important lesson . Girl 1 : Sweet . 1996 . Switzerland . In what would seem like a Before Sunrise storyline , Raj meets Mahi ( Minissha Lamba ) on board a Euro-train , and engineers his way to be able to spend time alone with his mark , on the pretext of sending her to Zurich to reunite with her family for their trip back to India . This episode sets the stage for Raj as the manipulative casanova , while Mahi is a very girly girl who harbours dreams of that perfect man , the perfect romantic encounter , and that perfect romance coming out just like her favourite movie . Only to discover that her puppy love , with sweet nothings and dedicated poems , resulted to naught when Raj's game is exposed . Broken Heart 1 . Girl 2 : Sexy . 2002 . Mumbai . Raj seemed to have moved on to another target , though it may seem from the onset he's already been domesticated by Radhika ( Bipasha Basu from Dhoom 2 ) , a hot model and aspiring actress who's his neighbour and they're living in together . Raj would have thought that a woman like her , stereotyped of course , would be easy and loose , living the fast life , and wouldn't want to be tied down to marriage because it will hamper her career . So when an opportunity to work in Sydney comes knocking and presents itself as a perfect moment to ditch her , to his surprise Radhika contemplates marriage , which he tries wholeheartedly to avoid . She's willing to sacrifice her career for him , but suffers the unthinkable in being left at the altar . Broken Heart 2 . Girl 3 : Sassy . 2007 . Sydney . It's actually quite a no-brainer to cast Deepika Padukone here given that she too , like Ranbir Kapoor , had 1 feature film under her belt , and are relatively successful newcomers to the industry ( her first effort was in Om Shanti Om , and more recently , Chandni Chowk to China ) . And ( ok Gossipy news ahead ) this film actually was the catalyst for their much touted romance ( and you can see the dynamics at work with some of the behind the scenes and interviews included in the 2nd disc ) . Anyway her role here as Gayatri , a business school student who works her way through school as a supermarket check out girl and a taxi driver , impresses Raj a lot , enough to romance her in Venice , and give up his gallivanting ways . Only of course for him to have met his match , and got spurned on his marriage proposal . She's a modern girl wanting to live life on her own terms , so being someone else's wife has never featured in her plans . What goes around finally comes around . Broken Heart 3 . Raj's . While the first half of the movie before the intermission was pretty plain sailing romantic stuff , the second half proved to be more powerful , because the protagonist finally has his eyes opened by his new experience , and realized he's been quite a bastard . So off he goes to make amends with the girls whose hearts he had broken , and mind you , in both real and reel life , this is never easy . Especially when you have to go back and face the women who had one point in time truly love you , and your actions had single handedly destroyed their belief in romance , and change or scar them for life . We get a lot more jet-setting as well , all worked into the plot , such as the visits to Amritsar , Capri and Rome , as we follow Raj on his mission impossible to seek redemption and forgiveness from a housewife with a protective husband , and another who's now a renowned model with success to her head . I had enjoyed this section more because trying his best to be honest now , Raj has to strip his ego and really crack his head to device his forgiveness plan . Also , we get to see the different demeanours that both Bipasha Basu and Minissha Lamba had to tackle given their characters ' failed romance with Raj , which had changed them either for the better , or worse . The songs here proved to be catchy and fitting to each of the sweet , sexy and sassy persona that the girls bring to the table , and the beautiful locales they were shot in again were draws . Other than the very first musical number Bachna Ae Haseeno which opens the film , you don't get to see everybody on the same scene together , as each storyline took place under mutually exclusive terms , in timeline as well as locations . If there's something to take away from the film , then it's the lesson that Raj learns , with the past being over and there's no longer control over it , but we can rectify things for the future if we take action in the present . Call me a sentimental fool , but somehow this works on me .
514761	317399	451079	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Horton Hears a Who !	I've got to make a mental note that movies that have trailers playing in the cinemas for the longest time , do not a boring movie make , even if the first half of the movie plays like the extended version of the trailer , telling us things we already know , spelling out the premise all over again . Jim Carrey and Steve Carell unite on the big screen again after their short pairing up in Bruce Almighty , although this time they're animated as animals / creatures from Dr Seuss ' fictional world . Jim Carrey voices Horton , an elephant who in moments where you least expect , spew lines of poetry as dialogue . We're introduced to his character from the onset , though his backstory isn't really fleshed out , except that there are those ( like the Kangaroo ) who hates all for what he stands for . And simply put , Horton exudes all qualities typical of what elephants are made out to be - excellent memory , frightened about the unknown , and trustworthiness . These qualities are put to the test when he chances upon a speck on a clover . That speck turns out to be home for an ecosystem populated by Whos , minute creatures who seem to live very mundane , repetitive lives in their very own little paradise . Things start to go awry , especially with severe environmental changes , and despite the Mayor of Whoville ( Carell ) warning of the great unknown out there , like all predictors of impending doom , get ridiculed by the population . So begins the friendship between HOrton , trying to protect the world of his new found friend by relocating the speck to safe haven , and the Mayor , who must warn his disbelieving population about more dangers to come . For a while it drags on , with childish banter between the two lead characters , and the plot by Horton haters to bring him down by destroying his toy of the moment , not acknowledging his mantra that a person's a person , no matter how small . They want proof , and they're not getting any , since the Whos are also laughing at the fact that there are bigger creatures out there , outside the realms of their known atmosphere . It's as if one's trying to convince a large group of atheist that there is a supreme being up there and he's up there watching our every move ( ok , so Horton doesn't actually get to see them , but you get my drift ) . But the struggling with existentialism , is what made Horton Hears a Who shine brightly , and made the ticket worthwhile . A pity we have to really wait out for it , but at least these tense moments came , better late than never , that really brought out enough drama and excitement that I never saw coming my way . Otherwise , the animation's pretty standard fare in 2D , and chock full of supporting characters ( voiced by Seth Rogen , Carol Burnett , Dan Fogler , Isla Fisher , Amy Poehler and Jaime Pressly et al ) just to ramp up the cute factor , without giving them much to do anyway , though I must admit the gorillas almost always crack me up ( you should see what they can do with their bananas ! ) Smart to debut this during the school holidays this week to catch hold of school going kids . Oh , and get yourself into the hall early as you'll get to see Ice Age's Scrat up to his antics to promote Ice Age 3 , due on in Summer 2009 ( yes , 2009 ! )
515489	317399	380609	7.0	A Nutshell Review : P . S .	At first glance the premise of the movie seemed a little like Nicole Kidman's Birth , where someone who's already dead gets reincarnated into a boy who seemed to know all her / their dirty little secrets . Anyway that was my first thought when I heard about the plot outline for P . S . , but that said , this story couldn't be anywhere near Birth . It's a story about second chances , and how you would choose to seize this chance to make up for what you didn't do the first time around . On a more personal note , it reminded me of what I did once , doing something which I didn't do initially , but here opportunity was presented with someone else , not as a substitute though , but it served as a catalyst to not allow things to not happen , but to take that leap of faith and give it a shot . Didn't turn out the way I wanted , but I guess I should be satisfied that I tried . Louise Harrington ( Laura Linney ) is head of admissions for an art faculty , and in an admission letter , noticed someone who shared a similar name as a deceased old flame . Breaking protocol , she arranges for him to meet , and soon enough , more protocol gets broken as she initiates a sexual relationship with F . Scott Feinstadt ( Topher Grace ) . Which of course should set tongues wagging given the power of her status , about keeping persona and business separate , about that lack of professionalism and danger of mixing business with pleasure . But there are no lack of stories about a younger man falling for an older woman , and earlier this year , we've seen Uma Thuman in Prime in the same boat as well . Here though there is a distinct lack of humour and frills in storytelling , as the dry delivery befits the theme and character of Louise as she constantly , and perhaps unconsciously , pities herself and warrants the same pity from others . And it is the breaking out of this mould and mindset that keeps the narrative together in an exploration of how , despite Louise learning about how her marriage to her ex husband , Peter Harrington ( Gabriel Byrne ) broke down . Making matters worse is her best friend Missy's ( Marcia Gay Harden ) meddling into her personal business , with a revelation making you wonder why she hasn't turned into a fiend instead . I've actually watched this movie not because of Laura Linney , even though she carries this movie on her shoulders , and that her Louise character is the central figure where things revolve , and characters interact around . Rather , it's more for Topher Grace , whose performance I enjoyed in In Good Company ( his character there I could relate to ) , and keeping in mind that he did this movie first . Next up would probably be his biggest commercial challenge yet , as he takes on the role of Eddie Brock / Venom in Spiderman 3 . P . S . is actually a postscript , and here , the characters are afforded that little extra to add on to their past history , to be accorded that moment in the present , to make amends and salvage a past they are ashamed of . The pacing might be trying for some , but it still makes for satisfying viewing if you're in the same boat looking for your own P . S . .
514578	317399	831888	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Tekkonkinkreet	Tekkonkinkreet opens this year's Animation Nation festival , running from today until 1 Dec 07 , showcasing a selection of animated feature films , shorts and documentaries from around the world . Last year , the festival scored a coup in having Paprika screened just after its Japan premiere I believe , and had the noir styled Renaissance screened too . This year , both Tekkonkinkreet and the highly acclaimed 5 Centimeters Per Second were sold out in days when tickets when on sale , and it's a pity I may not be able to catch the latter due to conflict in schedules . Nonetheless , Tekkonkinkreet lived up to its hype , although I found the story to be a little too perplexing for my liking . I guess with Japanese anime , some come with a huge dose of the fantastical , and you might not catch all in one screening , leading to longevity as you discover something new each time you view the movie . The story centers on 2 orphans , Black and White , who are essentially the Cat clan , guarding their city Treasure Town from perceived external threats . But they soon find that the big boys such as the Yakuza are slowly muscling their way in to establish money spinning business in the form of theme parks ( heh ) , and inevitably discover they are within the crosshairs of a major turf war . The attention paid to detail is simply amazing , as it seems like not a pixel on the canvas was wasted . Treasure Town itself is a sight to behold , with its dizzying levels that don't seem to end , and the camera playfully whizzing through buildings , bridges , nooks and crannies giving sense to claustrophobia . It's like Gotham City , only brighter , messier , and of course , without the Dark Knight , now instead , having Black and White play vigilante , Batman and Robin style . Being just boys , they possess ( and here's where its fantastical ) superhuman skills , putting martial arts swordsman to shame with their ability to scale buildings with the ease of a simple leap . Yes , our boys have skills like the Yamakasi , only that it's magnified ten thousand times . The set action pieces are excitingly crafted with excellent sound effects and design going into overdrive . The action pieces are spaced out quite well , starting with the satisfying chase sequence with Dusk and Dawn , with the flight-for-your-life battles with robotic assassins , and topped off with the urban legend Minotaur justifying his status . In between the fights are the quieter moments of course , with subplots that put the spotlight on the myriad of Yakuza characters , and the brotherly love shared between Black and White , who share a dream of an idyllic life at the beach house , where they can live in peace from the unnecessary bustle of the city , and from the trouble that comes looking for them . Based on the manga by Taiyo Matsumoto , I suspect there being a need to read up and do some research in order to appreciate this movie more . Akin to a cyberpunk movie where you can read its multiple layers , Tekkonkinkreet is first and foremost a visual spectacle , hands down , and doesn't fail in providing a Wow factor with its presentation .
514546	317399	386741	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Renaissance	Daniel Craig is making another impact on our screens , though a limited one , besides the latest grittier installment of the Bond Franchise . In this year's Animation Nation Festival opening film , Renaissance , he lends his voice as a lead detective character in perhaps THE animated movie of 2006 . Created using motion capture technology and done entirely in black and white , some reckon it to be similar to reading a Sin City comic book that moves . While Sin City itself was filmed by Rodriguez in live action mode , Renaissance is done in animation , and what beautiful animation it is . Without colour , the entire look and feel is hinged on the clever eye for lighting and shadows , to create the dark futuristic looking atmosphere of Paris 2054 . Hardcore fans of science fiction will probably find the story a yawn , as it rehashes tired plots of mighty futuristic conglomerates and the power that they exert on the commonfolk . Formula dictates that these successful companies are successful because they hide deep dark secrets , if once revealed , could bring about their downfall , and along with it , their grip on the future . Here in future Paris , the largest company Avalon makes its business in youth and beauty , where huge billboards with beautiful models tout the latest in Avalon products . However , a promising young Avalon scientist gets kidnapped , and its up to maverick suprecop Karas ( voiced by Craig ) to recover her . In the future , all cops have awesome tools to assist in their detective work , and Craig , like his Bond character , brings about a angst lone ranger character to his Karas , as tables are turned , the roles between hunter and prey get blurred , and with the usual expected twist at the end to add some flavour to a tired tale . But hey , while the plot might be uninteresting , we're all here for the animation no less . And it's simply amazing to see how , with just splashes of black and white , and superb control in shadow play , what may look easy to produce actually passes off in a sophisticated manner . What's amazing is the creation of the look of Paris of the future , and the characters when they interact , seem like blotches of black ink merging into and separating from one another . It is easy to mash everything up in an incoherent manner , but here , there is clear distinction within the barrage of blur . A joint French-UK-Luxembourg production , Renaissance boasts some excellent voice talents in " recognizable " names like Craig , Jonathan Pryce ( also a Bond alumni ) , and Catherine McCormack in the English soundtrack . There's also a French soundtrack , but that's not the version put on screen today , though I am curious to see how it actually sounds like . Given the sold out sessions of this movie in Animation Nation , it wouldn't be a surprise if it gets picked up for general release here . And what will be the icing on the cake , is Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly also hitting our shores . That'll be sweet !
514751	317399	1239313	7.0	A Nutshell Review : What On Earth Have I Done Wrong	What on Earth has Doze Niu done wrong ? Well , if this mockumentary is anything to do by , then there are a series of missteps that were aptly documented , ranging from relationship woes to professional difficulties all stemming from a lack of funding . Doze stars as himself , or at least the satirized version of himself , one who seemed a little overconfident in thinking that his latest mockumentary production about politics and the media circus , could take off without a hitch , given his track record and pioneering the " star idol " dramas on television . As with all productions , the reality of it is to secure funding , and for the most parts , this film tracks this difficult task , where the filmmakers have to pander to rich folks through entertainment , wining , dining , women of course and basically groveling at their feet . Funding trickles , and even government grants too come in installments . All these take a toil on Doze himself , where existing issues with his live-in girlfriend Ning Ning ( Chang Chun-Ning ) gets amplified , and the other bulk of this film traces this systematic disintegration of this relationship where counselling is in progress to hold it together , but without the fundamental issues being resolved unfortunately . Which is of course his not-too - subtle transformation into an egoistical , selfish man unable to keep his libido in his pants . But the film's a little deceptive in its message , and it doesn't seem to come out clear until of course the well-intended break away from the main narrative to pseudo-interviews with a bevy of stars and politicians , and the man on the street when they talk about what happiness meant . And that is the goal which everyone is trying to achieve constantly throughout a lifetime , to seek out a meaningful and happy life , which of course Doze at this stage is unable to grasp because of the negativeness . Not when you have a whiny secretary who comes to you every day with nothing but a continuation of woes that you have absolutely no certain solution to . It's not all doom and gloom in the film however , and much of the comedy comes from the straight and trash talking characters peppering their dialogue with foul language , cursing at almost everything whether in their sober or drunken state . The Taiwanese Hokkien used here is strong , much stronger than that heard in Cape No . 7 , and if I learnt anything new today , that will be GY is the English language equivalent of well , you know what when you read it out loud . It's an honest look into the Taiwan film industry , and to me that's interesting just as I come at it straight off the heels of the Hindi one in Luck By Chance .
515456	317399	393109	7.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Brick ( 2005 )	Winning the Special Jury Prize in the 2005 Sundance Film Festival , Brick is a detective movie that is in a unique league of its own . It's terribly unconventional , yet comes with a familiar sense of having seen it somewhere before . Set in a high school , the premise is anything but , with a murder mystery done noir style but in modern settings with teenagers , throwing multiple curveballs in terms of narrative style that writer-director Rian Johnson adopted . The first aspect of difference that hits you is that the language is totally out of this world . It takes a while to get used to it , as there's a peculiar slang that everyone uses , and it's not the usual hip words that get spewed now and then . It's done so all the time , before you finally realize that this is something of a surreal setting - the characters inhabit a world of their own that may seem like our own , but totally not so . But once you get the hang of it , you discover some consolatory joy in trying to figure out what sense do they all make , and sometimes this is revealed as part of the process our teen detective , Brendan Frye ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) goes through . Investigating the death of his ex-girlfriend Emily Kostich ( Emilie de Ravin ) , it all started when she started to SOS him for help , before casting him away all over again . When he discovers his body , he takes it upon himself to find out the truth about the seedy world of high school crime , involving characters like Tugger ( Noah Fleiss ) , femme fatale Laura ( Nora Zehetner ) and Kara ( Meagan Good ) , The Pin ( Lukas Haas ) and Dode ( Noah Segan ) , who turns out to be his ex's current squeeze . In true noir style , we follow Brendan every step along the way as he interacts with all the characters , trying to make sense of things , while dealing with various red herrings , manipulation , violence when the time calls for it , and the dropping of little clues before a very tense and climatic ending . We slowly discover the Whos , Whats , Whys of the Whodunnit , and although limited screen time is given for Brendan's interaction with Emily , you can't help but connect to personal situations where someone who is close to your heart start to sound you out , and you try to reestablish contact , only to be brushed aside harshly . And what is a detective without an able assistance working behind the scenes to feed you information ? The Brain ( Matt O'Leary , gotta love all those quirky character names by now eh ? ) serves as Brendan's , and their chemistry as partners not by choice , turns out to be quite entertaining . It's very difficult to imagine Brick was shot on a shoestring budget , given the high quality in production values , the unique storyline , and nice acting . It's a little movie that became a winner , so I'm recommending it , and for that ethereal haunting song that can easily become a earworm .
514488	317399	783233	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Atonement	So now we know why the young must be protected from vulgarities and from sexual scenes , because with vivid imagination , they could probably be quick to jump to conclusions , being unable to grasp and fully understand the situation at hand , nor the gravity of their actions , especially when they're shooting from the hip . Initially , I thought I would be able to watch Atonement if I had managed to make my way to Tokyo for its International Film Festival last October . But I didn't , and I waited , and waited , and when I finally managed to watch it this evening , I felt that it didn't work for me , no matter how much I can identify with the longing to be with someone , and being unable to . It contained themes I very much like , but perhaps I'm beginning to get tired of it , since they are somewhat negative emotions that do take their toil over a period of time . Set in the 30s England just before the outbreak of WWII , we get introduced to the rather aristocratic Tallis family , where we witness the budding start of a romance between Cecilia ( Keira Knightley ) and the housekeeper's son ROBBY ( James McAvoy ) , with the help of flimsy , wet lingerie to bridge the divide separating their swearing of true feelings for each other . However , to sister Briony ( Saoirse Ronan , who clinched an Oscar Nomination ) , she starts to see a different side of it , made worse by a misunderstanding and in actuality , a mistake Robby made when he handed over a letter written with tongue in cheek and brain in the gutter ( yep , you can say men think about sex most of the time ) . And that one single day had everything a loving couple could have wished for - the discovery and declaration of love , the passionate love making , but only for everything to come crashing to a halt when Robby gets accused for a crime he did not commit . And you can feel the disappointment and anger of course , at the accusation because it was somewhat steeped in presumptions of class or the lack thereof , and the hypocrisy , coupled with seething rage as we the audience , with knowledge of hindsight ( and the benefit of just knowing ) , can tell that it's so utterly wrong , with obvious clues of course to who the perpetrator might be . While we love to see the lovebirds coming together , the movie's more about the time they spend apart . And that unfortunately somehow sagged the movie to low depths , as we see them spend their screen time independently , with McAvoy brooding over his life now in disarray as he volunteers for war to escape from the confines of a prison cell , and Knightley unfortunately becoming relegated to a support role , which you can hardly feel her character , her pain , and her love for the man now so far away . It is hardly any wonder why both actors missed out on Oscar nominations ( not that it mattered ) , because their roles hardly challenged what these 2 actors could have delivered . The scene stealer turned out to be child actress Saoirse Ronan , who is the cause of the turn of events , though the mantle of her character get passed to Ramola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave . What made Atonement work though was the technical side of it . The score was excellent and director Joe Wright ( Pride and Prejudice ) made sure it gelled so well with the visuals , that it becomes an extension to what's on screen . You can't deny that art direction and cinematography were superb . Editing was non-conventional , but never confusing , offering you both what is perceived truth , and hindsight knowledge , just as how Briony would have experienced it . But what's missing , for a romance at least , and the danger of having every technical aspect delivered so clinically , was the absence of an emotional resonance , because without it , a romance movie can be pretty empty , and soulless , going through the motions without attempting to allow you to crawl under their skins to empathize with them and their sorry plight . I had looked forward to Atonement with so much anticipation , that I guess when I've finally seen it , my expectation got deflated so bad that it turned out to be anti-climatic for me , even with an ending that should have wowed and kept one thinking and discussing about the unfortunate futility of one's actions , set in stone , setting the wheel in motion , and being unable ever to be turning it back .
514843	317399	1142972	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Detroit Metal City	And I felt the filmmakers nailed it squarely on the head with the casting of Ken'ichi Matsuyama , more famously known these days as the teen detective L from the Death Note series . In that film he had disappeared behind a stoic and serious demeanour behind a lithe frame , being quite fleet-footed while snacking on sweet food . Here , Ken'ichi again disappears and in more challenging terms , being on opposite sides of the spectrum from the meek to the flamboyant , and if you're not impressed by his L , his turns here would impress as being a consummate character actor capable of fleshing out characters very convincingly . If it's a chameleon actor you're looking for , look no further than Matsuyama . As Negishi , his mushroom cut hairstyle sported fits the character to a tee . A mild mannered sissy nerd , he shuffles his feet from his hometown village to the bright city of Tokyo in the hope of fulfilling his dream of being a trendy pop singer . You know , the one who belts out bubblegum pop tunes about first love and sweet kisses . He lives by the mantra of " No Music No Dream " , and inspires his fellow peers to do the same and seize the day . Just so to tell you he's still a straight character despite his effeminate ways , he's attracted to Aikawa ( Rosa Kato , who resembles a little like Aoi Miyazaki , who's starring in yet another similar music - based movie in Shonen Merikensack which I am looking forward to ) . Who wouldn't ? But an unexpected opportunity to join a band , he soon finds himself manipulated by his female boss ( Yasuko Matsuyuki ) into becoming the frontman for the heavy metal band Detroit Metal City ( DMC ) as Johannes Krauser , the long haired , pale skinned singer from the depths of hell who sings raged filled songs and preaches satanism , hate , anger , murder and rape . He garners a country-wide following filled with rabid groupies , and is more wildly successful as part of the engineered metal band , than trying to strike out on his own as a frivolous pop singer that's a dime a dozen . It's an excellent contrast of characters , but more so , an examination of self and the personas we adopt in different situations . It might even be a classic case of Schizophrenia for Negishi , because as Krauser , he's really good at what he does , and almost comes second nature as that sissy man who had found an avenue to unleash his pent up frustration and hit back at the whole world , and get adored for that as well . Cursing and swearing comes second nature , and he can get really confused at times if his interests got mixed ? romancing his lady love who abhors metal music , and satisfying his legion of fans with a public appearance . Unlike the Incredible Hulk within whom Bruce Banner disappears , it's interesting here because Negishi has full conscious control over Krauser , but allows himself to cut loose and live up to that masked persona even if it means having to embarrass the woman he loves . It's about striking a balance between living your dream , and being practical about it . As Krauser , he inspires others into living theirs , even though he doesn't exactly get to do the same . But only because he does what he does best , even though he doesn't exactly subscribe to it . He commands his unwavering fans for whom he inspires , though in some negative ways , but what better than to express one's rage through music and at the concert venues only rather than to hit back in society - we don't see any of the metal fans causing trouble , and the amount of clout one has in influencing his followers to live for the better . It's this realization and awakening that Negishi understands his calling in life , that he cannot live a life that's for selfish personal interest ( in throwing away Krauser just so he can pursue his love ) over that of the benefit for the masses and those who adore him . It's like a superhero story of sorts as well , where the hero disappears into his sanctuary by having an alter-ego within which he can operate normally without the pressures of expectations . We become somebody else very easily when we have ourselves hidden behind a costume incognito , and can carry out feats which we normally wouldn't do for fear of identity , repercussions and of course shame if something goes wrong . The white face makeup is Negishi's secret formula in transformation from geek to devil , without fear of his family discovering his secret ( he tells them he works at a floral shop ) and disappointed his parents that he's a preacher for hate , in direct contradiction to the gentlemanly ways he's brought up in . But of course like any other movie , this one is not perfect . There were a number of scenes that were played out purely for laughs , but sometimes fell flat on its face for its repetitive nature . Such as having his boss from hell come trash Negishi's pastel coloured apartment just so that she could awaken the devil in him permanently , and provide for some misunderstanding between Negishi and Aikawa . Or that inexplicable scene of running with his legion of fans for miles before reaching a concert venue . One could actually tell Ken'ichi Matsuyama was panting under that thick makeup and heavy costume . To no surprise , DMC attracted more female fans than the male ones in the screening I attended , despite having metal music blaring that degrades the female of the species , so that can only attest to the magnetism that Ken'ichi has over his fans . It isn't exactly about metal music , nor is it about the comedy here , but it's about self and the masks we all wear . For that , this comes definitely recommended in the dilemmas that we lead our lives under from time to time .
514486	317399	443680	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford	The long title of 10 words strike you initially , and besides having a mouthful of a title , the duration too is at a whopping 160 minutes , of which I can humbly suggest to trim it down to a more manageable 120 minutes . Based on the novel by Ron Hansen , the narrated parts which provided much of the needed background on Jesse Jame coupled with key timelines , were somehow more enjoyable than the rest of the movie itself . For some reason , the voice-over , repetitive ( like a one-trick pony , though beautifully haunting ) score and soft visual focus provided it with some form of documentary styled legitimacy , only to be hampered by the more clunky delivery on some of the more dramatic aspects . This is not to say that the actors were below par in their fleshing of the characters , but you can sense a deep attempt in trying to emulate styles like Terence Mallick's , in crafting a movie which lingered with still visuals , silence , with unquestionably wonderful cinematography . Our notion of Jesse James is probably one of an outlaw of the wild west who's quick on the draw as well as being a notorious robber / killer molded into the Robin Hood reputation . There are plenty of different interpretations of Jesse James , but none comes so interesting or as intense as Brad Pitt's . Through his confident swagger and suspicious demeanour , here's a man who precedes his reputation , who is clear as crystal in knowing what's he doing , and what the risks are , but nonetheless human prone to err after all . However , the film's focus was presumably put more on Robert Ford ( Casey Affleck ) , the wide eyed recruit who joins Jesse's gang , and that became a dream come true as it presents an opportunity to work with his idol . And his idolization becomes a strange obsession , as he draws physical parallels between Jesse and himself , that makes even Jesse himself edgy and uncomfortable , even questioning at one point if Robert just wants to be like him , or be him . Hence sparks the crazed suspicion and like the adage says , it's better to keep friends close , and your enemies closer . I thought Sam Rockwell stole the show from both Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt in his portrayal of Charley Ford , which reminds me of a Chinese adage of pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger . His Charley is clearly no simpleton , but his depiction of being one probably led to his being able to survive for a long while , when Jesse slowly dispatches the others . But what took the cake , was his spot on impersonation of not only Brad Pitt , but of Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James as well , in a scene so short , but nonetheless quite pivotal leading to the final moments of the movie . There are a few points you must note about the movie . I felt that the full house audience didn't really know what to expect , thinking that it's Pitt on screen , and his presence actually drew in the crowds . And while everyone's waiting for the title incident to happen , they discovered that they're waiting too long . Bear in mind the film runs more than 2 . 5 hours , and you have to be incredibly patient to get there . I felt a little sorry for the masses who walked out , especially those who did so just before the turn of events , and thereon the pace actually quickened , though covering nothing more than what you can read from encyclopedias under 5 minutes . Those expecting big shoot-em-outs and action sequences like 3 : 10 to Yuma will also be disappointed , as the action here is never stylized , just presented as a matter of fact for cowboys in that era . Gun fights , if you can call them that , are so extremely ordinary , you'll find yourself more amazed by the intricate weapon design , and the plenty of gunpowder used which explains the plumes of smoke , coupled with the primitive , unsophisticated basic revolver that affects accuracy . Instead , what this movie is , is a well crafted and very measured piece of drama that tells the tale of a legendary outlaw , and his heinous betrayal .
515436	317399	106457	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Strange Take of Oyuki	The Strange Tale of Oyuki is probably the raunchiest movie to date in this edition of the Japanese Film Festival . While the earlier Imamura movies shown do have sexual scenes , this one takes the cake in its eroticism , treading so close to being soft-porn like in the style of Hong Kong Category III movies . But hey , I'm not complaining ! Based on a novel by Kafu Nagai , this movie uses a short story of the same name , and at the same time infused it with real diary entries of Kafu's as well , making it seem like an amalgamation of his life and that pre-war story . Some however , have claimed that it's solely based on the novel , and the director Kaneto Shindo had changed the protagonist to the author himself . Whatever the case is , since I can't read Japanese , and until someone who has read the book in its original language and watched the film can advise , we shan't rack our brains about this aspect of it . The story follows the middle aged author , Kafu Nagai ( Masahiko Tsugawa ) , in his gallivanting ways from the 1920s to post war Japan . It actually took the first 30 minutes or so to establish the fact that his literary works , which consist mainly of yellow literature , is not welcomed by fellow peers . Moreover , he has the propensity to wine and dine women , becoming a Don Juan of sorts , with a notorious reputation after establishing a series of conquests in Europe and North America . The beginning actually painted him as a lonely man as well , unable to hold down a regular relationship , opting instead for fleeting ones with geishas and waitresses . Things start to change when Fate brings him to Oyuki , a prostitute , one rainy night , and romance start to blossom between the two despite his concerns about their age gap - he's close to 60 , while she's mid 20s . As they do the horizontal tango in between the sheets on a regular basis , she starts to really fall for him , while he , always on the apprehensive . It also brought to mind about How to Become Myself's issue on persona , as we see how Kafu engineers himself to be a pornographic photographer as a cover for his researching writer role . But it's not just sex and skin all the way . The movie allowed some suggestion of the geisha tradition and their skills in the art , and I was rather surprised at the hard anti-war stance and criticism that the narrative had taken up , with its documentary reel like scenes of the Imperial Army , and how because of the war the common folk are made to suffer with the constant barrage of air strikes nearing the end of the war . Masahiko Tsugawa provided some comedic relief in his acting , though I'm unsure if his wide - eyed eyeball look which seemed to draw more chuckles than anything else , and rubber faced expressions , were deliberate . As a man who decided early how to lead out his elderly life , I thought he had a somewhat stoic presence as an uncompromising man , and one who needed to get his rocks off . Yuki Sumida as the titular Oyuki , had actually won a number of awards for the role , and while her portrayal of the prostitute is sympathetic , I suppose she'll be best remembered for shedding her clothes instead . Unpretentious and straightforward movie which runs almost like a bio-pic , I do not deny The Strange Tale of Oyuki as being entertaining , for the right reasons of course . Definitely an easy movie to sit through after an almost week long program of heavier material .
514444	317399	1095174	7.0	A Nutshell Review : New In Town	In this economic climate of corporate downsizing , one wonders how the corporate boys in monkey suits on the board run their business with the help of a spreadsheet . It's always easy to see which areas of the business bleed red , and decide then on to send hatchet-men to the ground to execute ( pardon the pun ) and prune various portions of that wound to try and stop the hemorrhage , failing which a complete amputation would be required . It's easy making such decisions from the ivory tower devoid of decent human interaction , but never easy from the folks on the ground to do it , because it leaves just a bad aftertaste , especially when the folks are friends , and people you know . For Lucy Hill ( a visibly aged Renee Zellweger ) , she's a high flying executive of a corporation headquartered in sunny Miami , but what I think was because of a sexist board , she gets sent off to the wintry conditions of a small Minnesota town to effect their wishes , and that is to remove 50 % of the employee population there to keep an unprofitable factory there under some cost control . Being an alpha-female type who never say no to challenges and her career , she makes that journey and has this high-and-mighty air about her , which through the course of her stay in town , their warm hospitality , sense of humour and all round , small town camaraderie , will slowly thaw that cold heart of hers . There were plenty of charming moments in the film , courtesy of a whole host of ensemble characters built for the plot , such as Siobhan Fallon's Blanche Gunderson , who becomes Lucy's personal assistant aka secretary , and in all earnestness , tries to establish a friendship with her would-be boss , as well as trying to hook Lucy up with the town hunk Ted Mitchell ( Harry Connick Jr ) who so happens to also be heading the workers ' union . Complications naturally arise from this conflict of interest , which puts Lucy in two minds as she has her orders to follow , yet find herself inevitably drawn to follow her heart as well . And yes , this is also truly a romantic movie , which I thought had effectively balanced affairs of the heart as well as how modern day corporations run the shop , with pink slips being very easy to dish out . Some portions remind me of a Hong Kong movie about a noodle factory ( whose title eludes me at this moment , but starring Sam Hui and Tsui Hark , yes you read me right ) , where a band of merry men have to put aside their differences from their immediate manager and amongst themselves , to try and salvage their jobs and their livelihood . It's a pretty standard affair that you see both the problems and the solutions coming from a mile away when they're mentioned , and the plot is extremely straightforward as well , with no meandering twists and turns . But hey , it's supposed to be a romantic story , and both Zellweger and Connick Jr did well given their limited screen time together to make it all believable . But the scene stealer here has got to be J . K . Simmons , who disappears effectively behind a fat suit and is quite unrecognizable . He represents the kind of supervisors that managers love to hate and have no qualms giving the marching orders to , but also serves as a reminder that such on-the-ground folks who garner the respect of the troops , are always worth their weight in gold , because once they're on your side , they have motivational techniques par none to get things done . I was OK with the romantic plot here , but the Management 101 issues presented , was way more entertaining and valuable .
514737	317399	465624	7.0	A Nutshell Review : My Super Ex-Girlfriend	Look ! Up in the Sky ! It's a bird ! No , it's a plane ! No , it's G-Girl ! New York City's newest superhero , with powers and origins adopted from Metropolis ' Man of Steel . She can fly , has super-strength , can hear the frequency of a police radio , able to shoot beams from her eyes , looks like Uma Thurman . . . she's the ultimate hot babe any dude can ask for . Unless of course , given her powers , she's also a tad insecure and can turn out to be any dude's worst nightmare with her clingy , needy nature . If Superman's alter-ego Clark Kent is mild mannered , G-Girl's equivalent in Jenny Johnson is the bespectacled arty type with a touch of neuroticism . It's basically a romance between her and an unlikely , fairly ordinary bloke Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) , who picked her up during a train ride with the encouragement of good friend Vaughn Haige ( Rainn Wilson ) , and with a stroke of luck , managed to snag a date and more . It's a fun movie about relationships , or the desperate lack thereof , and given it's reversal of super-being gender , provides a different perspective altogether . While the comedy's fun at certain points , with its load of sexual innuendos and situations ( somehow it's almost always about sex ) , the movie felt like it went on autopilot , relying pretty much on its strong links to its adapted source material , right down to the parody of her weakness , You have that dastardly evil genius villain Professor Bedlam ( Eddie Izzard ) , and many scenes taking a mickey out of the Superman movies . It plays out similar to the earlier Ivan Reitman movies , like Ghostbusters and Evolution , kinda kinky , kind funny , formulaic and pretty much children friendly ( despite the sexy bits ) . I thought that the cast had a pretty fun time doing the movie , with supporting characters like Anna Farris providing additional eye candy as the love rival . The special effects by Digital Domain were pretty nifty too , and I liked those swirly-bits when G-GIrl takes flight . Don't bother too much about the uber-thin storyline , but just enjoy the ride right up until the quirky , amicable settling of outstanding issues . And if you really wanna try to look hard into it , it's a reminder to us guys that soon enough , women will rule the world , and we probably don't mind sitting back and enjoying that odd beer while they bring home the bacon . Stay tuned after the animated end credits for an easter egg scene involving Vaughn and his apparent secret beneath his cool-cat demeanour .
514648	317399	449951	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Ghajini DV	So the dust is beginning to settle for A . R . Murugadoss ' Ghajini starring Aamir Khan , given that it had broken , and is still continuing to rake in stellar box office receipt records for a Bollywood movie around the world . For me , it piqued my interest enough to revisit his 2005 Tamil version starring Surya Sivakumar in the lead role , with Asin who also starred in both versions as Kalpana , and Pradeep Singh Rawat as the villain , curiously not called Ghajini here , but Laxman . I shall leave comparisons with Christopher Nolan's Memento unmentioned because I've done so with my earlier review of Ghajini ( 2008 ) . Instead I shall focus more on the similarities and differences in the Murugadoss films , since he crafted both the screenplay and dialogue , and directed both movies with predominantly the same leads , save for the protagonist Sanjay Ramasamy ( Surya Sivakumar ) inflicted with short term memory loss . The opening credits stayed similar , and for the first half hour , I thought I would be watching the same 2008 movie all over again . I see the same policeman ( Riyaz Khan ) going through the same investigations and employing tactics seen before , and even the scene transitions relied on the same time lapse technique already seen . The structure of the story remained for at least two-thirds of the film , and especially the romance between Kalpana and Sanjay , except for distinct differences such as the knowledge of who the chief villain is with the possession of the all important polaroid , and spending some time showing how Sanjay had tattooed himself with the clues . While it may be easy to work on a remake , given that you're basically rehashing what you've done before , and more so with experienced actors in the same role again , it is easy to free fall into complacency and to go through the motions with your own remake especially . But kudos to Murugadoss for identifying plot loopholes , and to make changes for the better in the Hindi version , rather than to import such flaws wholesale into the new movie . Obviously the production values were ramped up significantly from this version , but that's not the only thing that had improved . as was the editing . The pace here is pretty much slower , and had plenty of fat which were removed in the latest version . Tweaks were done for the better in the latest , especially so in the editing department to gel scenes together much more effectively . Here , you get abrupt jumps and cuts , so the narrative turned out to be a bit choppy at times , especially so when it's time for the rudimentary song and dance sequence which pops out from almost nowhere . Sorely missed were the daily routine that Sanjay would have to relive everyday , which I thought was an important scene to reinforce his difficulty in trying to hunt down the gangsters . The final act turned out to be an all out whackfest without too much thought put into making this film more plausible , opting instead for a pseudo-terrorist hostage situation . You could tell from the onset at this point that there were a few scenes Murugadoss would have elected to do differently , such as to avoid having Sanjay as a muscled and skilled fighter from the onset , with exaggerated Kollywood styled prowess to boot too . These were toned down for Bollywood , and having Aamir show off his six-packs from extreme training also helped to make it believable . Murugadoss also decided to downplay and eliminate the complicated finale battle here , which made use of wire-fu , and his decision to change the that battle to that seen in the Hindi version , is much appreciated for creating a stronger sequence altogether . Even the very last scene of his reworked version fared miles better since it sent home some very strong emotional chords to the audience , rather than this version here which actually was quite creepy ( my first thoughts were of reincarnation ! ) Music wise , with all due respect to Haarris Jayaraj for his work here , I thought A . R . Rahman's actually worked better . The music here , while still effective , was a little downbeat , and the picturization ( if that's what it's called ) could have been vastly improved , many times being something like watching a tacky 80s made music video . Compare Guzarish and Sutrum Vizhi ( which is my favourite song of the lot in this film ) , and you'll see what I mean . The placeholders for music to come on were pretty much the same , save for this version having what I thought was 2 distinct pieces reworked or removed totally from the remake for pace purposes . Sutrum Vizhi has this really hypnotic , head-banging beat to it . My frank opinion would be to watch the Hindi version not because it's vastly superior , but for its production values as well as a more coherent story reworked for a much better result . This version is still valuable in terms of seeing how far everyone had come , and for fans of Asin , this is the film that provided her that breakthrough in her career . The Region Free DVD by Venai Holdings is presented in matted letterbox format . Visual transfer is average at best , seemingly done off a VHS quality source . Toward the last hour there's this curious green tinge at the top right hand corner , but wasn't irritating enough to mar the enjoyment of the film . At times there were some pops and cackles in the visuals as well , but nothing too serious . Audio quality is in stereo and in the original language track , with English subtitles as an option . No other extra features contained in the DVD . Guess I shall wait for Ghajini 2008 to see if it comes with a special edition of sorts for some making of documentaries . Given the box office success , I don't see why not .
514872	317399	794373	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Sugar & Spice	Girls are made of sugar and spice and all things nice , but of course there are those laced with wasabi that will hit you when you least expect it to . Based on the novel by Eimi Yamada , Sugar & Spice is not your conventional romantic drama , not that it's because it's not the usual boy - meets - girl - they - hook - up - boy - loses - girl - boy - tries - to - win - girl - back kind of movie , but because it takes a long hard look at a certain condition , and that's the rebound . And perhaps many would have disliked the movie because it touches that raw nerve , either you're the perpetrator , or the victim of . There are limited amount of fan favourite saccharine sweet moments , and instead , lessons dished out were plentiful , which does get try as it tends to nag . Obviously , the movie is hinging on the star appeal of the teenage lovers , Shiro ( Yuya Yagira , who won a Best Actor award from Cannes with his portrayal in Nobody Knows ) , and hot model-actress-musician Erika Sawajiri as Noriko , and therefore perhaps paid little attention to the pacing , which turned out to be erratic , and treading on the route to art-house styled contemplation , longing and scenes of regret . Shiro is a student at the crossroads of his life - whether to enroll in cram school to prepare for higher education , or to follow a small step towards his dream of working with cars . He opts for the latter , and finds himself as a pump attendant at a gas station . Noriko becomes the new apprentice at the station , and needless to say , Shiro gets smitten by the newcomer . But the catch here is that this is Shiro's first stab at a relationship , and while he is brought up to be nice , girls hate wimps , don't they ? And Noriko's no angel either , having just been out of a rocky relationship with a relatively richer guy , and now having to be stuck with Shiro . Every step of the way , you wonder if she's on the rebound , and just grabbing at whoever is conveniently available at the time . Indecisiveness abound , but more often than not , cold hard logic prevails and it boils down to practicality , and materialism . The story finds itself spending quality time with an examination of first love , and the pain that it usually brings , especially when one finds oneself drawing the stick with the shorter end . It's heartbreaking , but the story encourages one to learn from mistakes , and to move on , though it presented this thought quite clumsily . The scene stealer here belongs to Mari Natsuki as the free loving , hippy grandma of Shiro , who drives a hot rod of a vehicle and has a toy boy to boot ( for a 70 year old ! ) . She dispenses advice to both parties , and drawing on her past experiences to do so , teaching her grandson to know when to be a gentleman , and when the time's come to be tough . It serves as a reminder to all those out there who still nurses a broken heart , to cherish those ( previous ) memories , but not to ditch the forest for the tree . While the proceedings seem more bleak throughout , the light at the end of the tunnel provided much needed hope to lift the movie from its dark tones . And the soundtrack just puts a smile to my face too .
515022	317399	497877	7.0	A Nutshell Review : 4 : 30	Audiences aware of Royston Tan's works , will almost always recall his controversial shorts like 15 and Cut . Full of colour and packed with fascinating visuals , his short films have so far been anything but a silent movie , and everything like song , dance and music , have found their way as a signature . All these bells and whistles take a backseat in 4 : 30 , a quiet film save for some lines of dialogue . The closing film of this year's Singapore International Film Festival where it played to a sell out crowd , the first thing that comes to mind is , is this a Singapore movie ? With a style so commonly found in art-house films , you'll probably be amazed that we do have someone here capable of crafting a contemplative movie immersed so richly in green hues . A previous short film closest to the mood and visuals to 4 : 30 would be Sons ( you must check it out ! ) In the still of the night which is 4 : 30 am , a little boy Xiao Wu , wakes up almost religiously each day to spy on a Korean tenant of his family apartment . A latch key , lonely boy , he finds joy in crafting a virtual relationship with the man Jung , a foreigner with an agenda here , a friend he cannot communicate directly with given barriers like language and his non presence during the day . But of course that's just one , obvious layer of the movie . With clues and markers peppered throughout the movie , you'd be compelled to wonder if what is unveiled on screen , can be taken as a matter of fact . There is obviously no regular school in December , the boy's abuse of cough mixture a worrying phenomenon but one which suggests something of a dreamlike bizarreness , and a tinge of homo-erotic sentiments . These markers will tickle your mind as you try and sieve figments of imagination , from screen reality . The many silent moments give your mind plenty of workout time , sometimes into overdrive . There are plenty of Royston touches to this beautifully shot film , like his preference for all things old - like the Telecoms push button telephone ( in green no less ) , the cloth wardrobe , and the facade of the Look Clinic . The main lead Xiao Li Yuan who plays Xiao Wu , is effectively bilingual , and quite believable in his role as the lonely kid yearning for some serious attention which he is not getting from his parents , lending to his frequent disruption of a neighbourhood tai-chi session , to his fixation and stalker-like behaviour towards Jung . Whatever your interpretation of the events that transpire , ultimately , it's quite a sad movie , of unrequited " love " and friendship , about the road of loneliness . It's an engaging character piece , and of the ties that bind . p . s . 4 : 30 is now showing in 3 theatres , with limited schedules . If you really want to check out how different this movie is from his previous ( short ) works , or if you dig Kim Ki-duk's stuff , then waste no time ya ? The afternoon weekend screening I went to , only had 5 folks including myself . Once you're done with Supes , give the lonely kid some love : - )
515074	317399	398165	7.0	A Nutshell Review : The Longest Yard	The Longest Yard is one of many remake movies that Hollywood has churned out in recent years . Others did well , like Charlie's Angels , while some fumbled , like Bewitched . This Adam Sandler movie , helm-ed by director Peter Segal ( who also worked on Sandler's Fifty First Dates ) , managed to keep afresh the already familiar material . It was a perky ( heh ) start to the movie , with No Doubt's ( and of course Gwen Stefani's vocals ) starting the movie , keeping in mind that MTV Films also had a hand in this , it isn't surprising that the audience will be treated to various pop , rock and hip hop music . Sandler plays Paul Crewe , a forgotten , down and out quarterback infamous for throwing in the towel and rigging a game . He's sick of life with his control freak fianc√©e ( did Courteney Cox undergo a boob job ? ) , and got arrested for dangerous drink driving when she reported he stole her Bentley . Well , we have to thrown our protagonist into prison to get the game going , right ? Unfortunately for Crewe , the prison guards are a bunch of sadists , and fortunately ( depending on how you look at it ) the warden is a football fanatic , who propositions Crewe to set up a team amongst the prisoners for his guards to have a practice tune up match against . Most of the movie then dwelled on recruitment and training , as with all sports movies , the recruits are all misfits , which is supposed to provide some comedic moments . Scenes in which Crewe handpicks prisoners according to their traits ( aggression , speed etc ) were formulaic , but extremely fun . An addition to the fold is actor Chris Rock as Caretaker , the man with links on the inside and outside ; the resident smuggler . As with all remake movies , there should be the complimentary actor from the earlier film , and here we have two , the more recognizable one being Burt Reynolds as the coach , who played the protagonist in the original . It's kind of ironic that in prison films , the line between " good and evil " are somewhat blurred , with good characters having improper morals , and the bad characters turning out to be likable underdogs . For all its funny set pieces , the humour seemed somewhat subdued , not overly slapstick , or worse , feeling forced . You know what's coming , but the delivery was enough to at least make you smile . What crowned the filmed was the football game at the end . Shot wonderfully with the right moments to break into slow-motion or high speed action , it managed to convey the contact sport accurately , and with excitement thrown into the mix . You will really be rooting for the Mean Machines , as do the transgender inmate cheerleaders and Rob Schneider . But the main theme was on obtaining , losing , and maintaining Respect , and the exploration of camaraderie amongst the boys in the hood . Standing out , in a somewhat cringeworthy manner at times , was when Crewe persuades a bunch of basketball playing inmates to join his team , as do some parts in the end game . This movie should appeal to the fans of sports films , one filled with plenty of physical contact , moments of humour , and a predictable finale ( which of course is known to those who watched the original ) .
515108	317399	407998	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Mistress of Spices	The number one appeal that this film had for me , is to see Aishwarya Rai in action . I've never seen the movies of Miss World ' 94 , and missed out on Bride and Prejudice . Written by the same team , Mistress of Spices is a mythical tale which makes the Indian spices the star of the movie , set in a medicinal store , with Rai as the conjurer and mixer of modern day " bomoh " like medicine to cure mankind of their ills . Some might not like the way the movie presented itself , with its cheesy focus and voice-over on the qualities of the various spices . Granted , it's like going to your medicinal hall , or clinic , and doing a closeup feature on the medicines and roots , characterizing them . And with the obvious red chili being the signal of danger , it's a tad simplistic . However , the way that the spices are shot , made them look beautiful in their sacks or glass bottles . Hidden behind these herbs is the mistress Tilo ( Rai , meaning sesame seed ) , whose precognitive powers are granted to her by the spices . OK , so I had a corny joke running each time Tilo asked the spices to speak to her - isn't she doing a Muad'Dib thingy like Dune's Paul Atreides ? Anyway besides the mistress helping her customers with their daily troubles by selling them wonderfully nice sounding concoctions , in comes Dylan McDermott's Doug . Better known for his leading role in the television series The Practice , he's the man unknowingly seducing Tilo from her mission in life . You see , being a mistress has its rules , and they are to never let another skin touch yours ( ooh , touchy ) , to never step out of the shop ( that's pretty restrictive and a possible loop hole ) and not to concoct anything for one's own benefit . So while trying her best to stay away from the good looking man , the movie spins into a tale of forbidden love , with punishment meted out by the powers that be dwelling within those spices - I tell you , they're quite vengeful . And as if it couldn't decide , there's an underlying reminder for Indians based overseas about never forgetting their roots and culture , to never fall for the enticing decadent lifestyle of the foreigners . But screw all that , the real star of the show is Rai . I'm already smitten by her huge twin green-blue expressive eyes with lives of their own . You could just focus on them , and they could tell you a story already . And yes , that chili-red sari , is uber hot ! Guess my to-watch movies is piling up already , with Bollywood added to the list . Rai fans probably won't want to miss this , despite the movie's relatively weak and fluffy plot .
515350	317399	318202	7.0	A Nutshell Revoew : ( DVD ) To Be and To Have ( 2002 )	The thing that caught my eye to picking up this documentary DVD from the library was a cute kid with dirty hands soiled by paint , and the plenty of high flying accolades bestowed on the film by reputable critics and publications . Naturally my interest was piqued , but after watching this Nicholas Philibert directed documentary , while it had its charming moments , it doesn't warrant , in my opinion , some of the praises that it had garnered . George Lopez is a teacher in a small town , and has to handle the challenge of educating his students , ranging from 3 years of age , to 11 . Being a small town , naturally resources are limited , and he has not only to cater his methods to teach his students of different capabilities , but also to tackle a myriad of subjects , ranging from art , to mathematics , to language too . Talk about multi-tasking , and extreme dedication to the job ( most I guess would have bolted given the workload , and responsibility ) , he doesn't find the need to raise his voice at those who misbehave , choosing instead to reason with them like adults , using his soft voice to win the most hardened of hearts . But the stars of the documentary are the children . Philibert had revealed in an interview ( included in the DVD as an extra ) that he had deliberately chosen this particular school , for its logistics in supporting a film crew on site , but more importantly , for the size of the class of students , nothing too large that each becomes a passing face , but something manageable so that they can come across vividly . And having chosen this particular class of 12 , and their teacher with his more than positive approach and attitude , are what made this documentary tick . The children are as adorable as they are in need of some serious education . Early in the documentary we see them struggling with mathematics ( OK , so they are the 3-4 year olds ) , but in one truly memorable scene was when one of them brought back his homework , and had to unwittingly enlist the help of parents and relatives to help him solve the problem . But alas , to my dismay , I later found it to be fabricated , which sort of spoilt my overall feeling toward this documentary - thou shalt not meddle with thy subjects . However , what I thought was unique in Philibert's approach to documentary making , was the conscious decision to minimize the number of talking heads . There isn't any , not until the one hour mark , where George Lopez had to give a short history of himself and his underlying motivation to teaching , but other than that , it's almost like a fictional narrative in the way the subject of education is being handled . Not one with big sets nor wanting to incorporate controversial elements , To Be and To Have is stoically quiet , and touching in the moments where teacher and students connect , especially when one is trusted enough to be a confidante , and dispensing good advice and words of encouragement to children under his charge . For those scenes I credit George Lopez for his relentless work in providing a firm grounding and good work attitude to the students under him . But alas , any notions I had on the film's honesty were somehow tainted by Philibert's revelation . Still not a bad movie , despite it being slow ( to mirror the long , arduous journey one goes through to receive a decent education ) , but one which could have been a lot more sincere in putting forth the material .
515143	317399	1293094	7.0	A Nutshell Review : School Days With A Pig	Our nature is such that we care most for the people we are related to , and know on a personal level . Otherwise , it's likely everything else is just a number , a statistic , something that feels so distant that it's genuinely difficult for us to sympathize , or emphatize beyond a cursory statement that explains how we should feel as decent human beings . In increasing levels of concern when a tragedy occurs , if something strikes overseas , it's unfortunate . If it's local then it's lucky it didn't affect someone we know . If it does and it's not family , we offer our condolences . If someone we know becomes collateral damage , we suffer inconsolable rage even . School Days with a Pig plays along this line where teacher Mr Hoshi ( Satoshi Tsumabuki ) decides to give his class a head start in life , where Man sits on the top of the food chain , and everything below is fair game when it comes to filling up the stomach . He also attempts to teach the children that in our living comes the sacrifice of other living beings just because they are expendable in the natural order of things , but that doesn't mean not acknowledging creatures like chickens , cows and pigs . Given his unorthodox methods , it was also explained why specifically a pig and not the other animals , so that may appease those who jump the gun too quickly in say this reeks of Babe . The film reminded me of an anecdote which is from another movie ( whose title eludes me now ) , where a teacher had asked his students to draw a chicken , and he received pictures of burgers , patties and basically animal parts like thighs , breasts and wings . It's come to a stage where our food supply chain is so modernized and processed , that children no longer recognize or need to know the source of their food . We also don't see how the animals get chopped and slaughtered behind the scenes , and I suppose many more would turn vegetarian should we witness how it comes through the assembly line . In any case , this story on the surface is about the raising of a piglet by the teacher and his students from the 6th grade , where their objective from the start is to nourish it , and then to eat it . Directed by Tetsu Maeda based upon the novel by Yasushi Kuroda , it comes with plenty of excitable kids who are now given their first collective pet , and take great pains in order to ensure that their teacher's plan works to a T . From working together to build a play pen for the pig , to the diligent gathering of leftover food as meals for their pet , they learn the value of teamwork , where everyone chips in a little for the good of everyone else . Then comes the more interesting portions of the film , in between the usual bonding scenes with the pig through fun and games . We have at least two extended debating scenes where Mr Hoshi moderates discussions amongst his charges , separated into those who still insist their project should end with the consuming of P-Chan ( christening any pet is a bad idea for those with intent of abandonment and the likes ) , or to allow a change in letting it continue living in the school grounds as a pet . It is here that the viewpoints get accentuated through the different personalities in the classroom , where everyone is given fair opportunity to make their point heard . It's like observing a political debate in progress , where both sides are equally passionate about their viewpoints , and sometimes allowed emotions to run high , which allowed for some play-acting by the children that I couldn't fathom whether it was all staged , but coming from within for real . And that wouldn't be difficult too , given that they had indeed spent some real time with the pig in order to draw upon some real emotions as to whether they wanted it to live , or to end up on their dinner plates . And as they inched toward graduation , their decision , which is still much split , becomes more dire with an impending sense of urgency to resolve . The piglet might be the gimmick in School Days with a Pig , but the real stars of the show are the children in their natural ability to showcase their range of emotions . It's little wonder why this film won the Toyota Grand Prix Jury Award , and the Audience Award in last year's Tokyo International Film Festival !
514442	317399	851532	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Forever Enthralled	I got to watch this trailer inadvertently when it was part of a montage sequence honouring Chen Kaige with the Akira Kurosawa Award during last year's Tokyo International Film Festival , and I was actually thrilled to have caught glimpses of it . I thought the boo-boys were out too early in lamenting Chen's choice of Leon Lai in the titular role , thinking that he would ruin what would be a decent biopic about one of China's greatest opera singer . To me , those fears were quite unfounded , as I felt Leon Lai actually did reasonably well when under the thick operatic makeup to transform himself for his stage persona , from Mei Wanhua to Mei Lanfang , where portrays only female characters . But of course if put side by side with Chinese actor Yu Shaoqun , Lai paled considerably as Yu was obviously the better of the two , portraying the younger Mei who found his true calling when opportunity came knocking on his door , and deciding to seize it , yet being mindful all the time of where his roots were . And the best parts were of course the first act , where Mei decides to up the ante and challenge his master , the then largest opera star Shi Sanyan ( Wang Xueqi ) to a show-down of sorts if you will . Under his master's wing , he finds himself somewhat stifled in not being able to explore his roles much further , given the master's fear that his thunder will be stolen . At the encouragement of maverick magistrate and future sworn brother / business manager Qiu Rubai ( Sun Honglei ) , he finds some new found confidence to test waters while still keeping true to the core of his character , thus earning new praise , and given one's talent with nothing much to lose , one will go for broke - win and you win all , lose and you have really no reputation at stake , in contrary to his master . It's about control , or the lack thereof . From early on we learn that actors in the days of the crumbling of the Chinese monarchy that they do not have any respect , and have to play to the whims of those with power , money and fame . Even then the child actors have to pander to lords with a penchant for young boys . Mei does not buckle his self-worth , and is pretty clear that while he portrays ladies in more feminine terms than real ladies , that it does not make him easy fodder . And we follow through his life how he does not get to live the life he wants to lead , but rather according to both the rules and regulations of the stage , as well as the same off it in society . Be it instructions from his managers , his wife Zhifang ( Chen Hong ) or the Japanese occupiers , each seemingly want to exert an influence over his career and personal life , not so much for personal gain , but to propagate that legend and persona so carefully crafted over the years . Naturally Mei finds an avenue to fight back , and does so through an affair of the heart . While he portrays females on stage , he meets his equal in Meng Xiaodong ( Zhang Ziyi ) , who is his mirror opposite , the best in the business in playing male characters . Together they blaze a trail of glory , and naturally leads to tongues wagging . While Zhang Ziyi may share top billing , in actual fact she's nothing more than a supporting role , coming in only in the middle portion to highlight Mei's need for escape from his rigid world . Much is said about the supporting actors doing a far better job than the leads , and that is true , in a nice way . My respect for the Chinese actors have grown from watching a number of indie and mainstream films , and I can't credit the likes of Sun Honglei , Chen Hong , Wang Xueqi and especially Yu Shaoqun in being nothing less than superb each time they come on screen to chew up the scenery . It's not really fair to say the leads acted poorly , because the supporting cast had raised the bar in delivery , which adds to the enjoyment of the film . I can never forget the really poor movie in The Promise which Chen Kaige made a couple of years back . The story was so bad it allowed the special effects to run wild in trying to salvage the show . There aren't a lot of Chinese bio-pics ( or at least those I have watched ) in recent years that were non-martial arts related ( think Ip Man , Wong Fei-Hung , Fong Sai-Yuk , Huo Yuanjia etc ) , and somehow I'm glad Chen Kaige found his mojo back to helm this , and in far elegant terms that I'm now better convinced to check out more of his filmography . He was able to shift gears quite effortlessly between distinct acts of the narrative , which straddled a timeline from after the Qing Dynasty to after the surrender of the Japanese . However , there might seem to be a quantum leap in addressing issues towards the last 30 minutes , but for everything else , it was paced quite evenly to keep you interest from waning . Forever Enthralled has all the ingredients of a credible epic , from beautiful set designs and art direction , to a wonderful soundtrack and elegant costumes , Chen Kaige does not scrimp in making this film look and feel just like it would back in those days of sheer opulence . While opera may be an artform that is dwindling here , don't let the Peking Opera focus here put you off , as you just might find some reason to want to watch the real thing if you have the opportunity to . Definitely recommended .
514713	317399	405325	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sky High	Since this is a Disney movie , I guess you'll know what to expect : humour , safe action , some camp , lotsa colour , and a feel good factor . Sky High is all these and , surprisingly , a whole lotta fun too ! Sometimes music makes the movie for me , and when I heard " Everybody Wants To Rule The World " , I knew the filmmakers had this done right , for a superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously . Sky High refers to a special school hovering up in the sky , where the children of super-beings go to , for an education to learn how to harness their powers . Interestingly , they do not learn whether to use it for good or evil , it's entire up to them ( i . e . no moral or social studies here ) . Will Stronghold had it tough from the start - being the only child of 2 Superhero parents ( most have only 1 parent as a super being ) , he had to uphold both his parents and the general population's expectation of his perceived abilities , which he knows is , none . What's more , his parents are the most powerful of them all , and everyone in school naturally gives respect to his family name . Alas , here's where the fun starts . There are plenty of one-dimensional characters , like the school pranksters , the loner with an attitude , the most popular girl in school , the cheerleader , the coward , the Haves and the Have-nots . Rather , make that the Heroes and the Losers / Sidekicks . Like local schools , Sky High segregates lessons between those with heroic-like powers ( super strength , speed , ability to fly , etc ) and those with more benign and less powerful abilities . However , my favourite scenes are those lessons with the Hero-Support group ( a more politically correct term for Sidekicks ) , taught by a teacher , whom I suspect is a jab at a grown-up Burt Ward Robin . While this is mainly a kid's show , there are more adult themes thrown in . Though adults would probably get tired with the Loser to Hero storyline , they'll probably get more of the inside jokes and references thrown in abundance in this movie . Hamming it up as the adult characters in the movie are Kurt Russell as The Commander , and Kelly Preston as Jetstream - Earth's mightiest couples , and TV's Wonder Woman Lynda Cater appears as Sky High's principal - do listen for a classic line ! Bruce Campbell contributes to the humour as the typical Coach Boomer ( sonic boom abilities ) , but my favourite ought to be Ron Wilson - Bus Driver ! So while the storyline's nothing to wow about , the delivery is still top notch , and it's pretty enjoyable watching a typical US high school drama with super powers added to spice things up . The special effects are well done too , though cheesy at some points , again , just to jab Adam West's Batman ( the pole , the bat-computer like computer ) . If you're a fan of cartoons and comics , you'll definitely not want to miss this - you'll be in awe at how many familiar references you can catch in this movie ! P . S . I swear there's a scene in the trailer that did not make it the final cut - and that is the one where Russell and Preston were chained up and held above ground . If I'm wrong , let me know .
515150	317399	56736	8.0	A Nutshell Review : L'Eclisse	Lorenzo Codelli highlighted to us that this was the first time that Michelangelo Antonioni had back to back to back productions , with the famed Trilogy movies released over a span of 3 years . And they cover distinct cities in Italy too , with the poorest parts of Italy in L'Avventura , the industrial capital Milan in La Notte , which had a lot of dialogue , and here , it's set in Rome . Compared to his peer Fellini , Antonioni preferred to shoot using real settings , which gives his films a kind of documentary like feel , versus Fellini's preference for recreating sets indoors . Being the last film that Antonioni shot in black and white , it closes a chapter and with colour in The Red Desert , opens a new one . L'Eclisse opens with a man and woman in total silence in an apartment . The woman behaves in a restless manner , moving from one area to the next , while the man remained seated on an armchair , unmoved . It went on for a few minutes , in utter silence save for the whirring sound of a table fan . But when they start to speak , we realize that Riccardo ( Francisco Rabal ) and Vittoria ( Monica Vitti ) are in the midst of a potential breakup . The reason is not given despite the former's probe , whether there was someone else coming between them . He gets a response he doesn't believe in , but realizes nonetheless that Vittoria has lost all feelings for him , for one reason or another . He sees her home as he always does , and says goodbye for the very last time . For some strange reason , it reminded me painfully of my own experience , so the opening scene served as a clincher right from the start . It's easy to relate to Riccardo because I too found it somewhat incomprehensible , and whatever he tried to do later - seeing her back , trying to call her later and so on , rings a bell that goes far back . But this is not a story about my life , but it's Michelangelo Antonioni's final movie in his loose Alienation trilogy , which I felt was the most accessible of them all , despite its extremely abstract finale consisting of a montage of images , lasting for a few minutes . In essence , I thought L'Eclisse contained what was essentially a very easy-to-follow story , with charismatic leads with whom you're able to hook your attention to , and while it continues with its crafting of powerful characters with complicated problems to deal with , it doesn't overwhelm and allows some breathing space to appreciate them a bit more . But I note that my focus had turned away from the " same-old " relationship issues , to the floor of the stock exchange , where Alain Delon's Piero got introduced , and in which the film seemed to spend a lot of time with a showcase of how deals were made through cryptic shouting and hand signals , which still has its usefulness in today's modern context , except for the bit where phone calls were still taken from the booths in harried manner . With Piero as a hot shot stockbroker , it allowed for this indulgence in setting many scenes in and around the stock exchange , where professionals and curious public punters gather to listen in for the best deals , and fervently place their bets . Perhaps one of the key takeaways here is that it served as a cautionary tale of blindly following the masses into stocks and commodities without fully understanding and appreciating the risks involved , with a fear of poverty spearheading a belief that the stockmarket provides an avenue for get rich quick schemes . But back to our lovebirds Piero and Vittora , it's a fairly simple courtship ritual they embark upon , with Piero being persistent in his chase , and Vittora being afraid to commit , especially since she's just coming out of a relationship where her feelings for her ex-lover inexplicably died off . There were some unintentionally comic moments in this chase that provided again a brief reprieve from the heaviness in its theme , and I can never get that very loud and rude " PRONTO ! ! " answer to a phone call out of my mind , where a hesitant cold call by Vittora to Piero caught him unexpectedly in a wrong mood . However , amongst the Trilogy , I felt this one had one of the more positive endings compared to the rest , with unflinching hope settled upon quite clearly , sans the last few minutes . As mentioned earlier , L'Eclisse has this end montage sequence that included revisits of the venues that the lovebirds had been to during the course of the story , and others . To me they seem quite jarring and I never fully understood their inclusion to round up the movie . But one thing I'm sure of , is that in Piero's mesmerizing mansion , his study had one of those pens which I'll be on the lookout for , and most definitely will get one for my personal use !
514881	317399	401248	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Beautiful Boxer	I suppose many non-Thai action film fans have their first exposure to the Thai martial arts of Muay Thai through movies like Ong Bak or Tom Yum Goong , both starring Tony Jaa . But the Muay Thai scene in Thailand was set abuzz in the 90s when transvestite warrior Nong Toom took to the stage and battled it out with other gladiators , while at the same time battled the prejudice he faced because he was different . Nong Toom was big at one time , with many media around the world following his exploits , as he wore makeup into the ring , and planted kisses on his defeated opponents . Beautiful Boxer is director Ekachai Uekrongtham's first feature film ( he also did the movie about our Geylang scene with Pleasure Factory ) , and the movie is a biography of Nong Toom ( played by real kickboxer Asanee Suwan ) and his dream of being a woman . Born to poverty and without means to fulfill his dream , he takes on the sport of Muay Thai for its lucrative awards , in part to provide for his family , and also as a means to save up for his sex change operation . His coach Pi Chart ( Sorapong Chatree ) sees the potential of his prot√©g√© , and while he doesn't chide Nong Toom for his feminine ways , had only one request , that he fights like a man in the ring . Similar to various fight sports biopics like Rocky and Cinderella Man , Beautiful Boxer charts the ups and downs of the protagonist , except that it ups the ante with Nong Toom's personal struggles , which present themselves as a bigger challenge with prejudice and misconceptions to fight , instead of the usual fight-against-poverty storyline . And like the movies in the genre , the battle in the ring is a sight to behold , as they get choreographed expertly , yet maintain a romantic , sexy look at the form of the sport . While Nong Toom does battle with various exponents , the filmmakers took great pains to ensure the fights differ from battle to battle , to make it interesting to watch without being repetitive , and we do see certain ancient moves that we've yet to see with the Tony Jaa movies . Asanee Suwan , a first time actor who auditioned for and gotten the role of Nong Toom , played the character with great earnestness , and was extremely convincing in his role as a man who struggles to find a way to bring the inner woman out in him . He made Nong Toom very humane , and you can really feel his pain and triumphs in and outside the ring . Nong Toom in any case was an interesting person to begin with , especially the way he handles discrimination . There were many poignant moments in his story from childhood , and what I thought was quite affecting was how he had to fend for himself in the ring especially - Fighters will find it a lost of face if they lose to someone " less than a man " , and this led to fighting Nong Toom more intensely , which of course made Nong Toom fight back even harder . While he couldn't do much about people laughing at him , he had to learn to feed off these negative energy to spur him on to win . It's a movie that works on both the emotional level and the physical side with its fight action sequence , and one of the better sports-fight biopics I have seen . Look out too for a cameo by the real Nong Toom ( now known as Parinaya Charoemphol after his sex-change operation ) . It brought to mind an adage which I shall paraphrase - the person might be different , but the struggles faced are the same .
515128	317399	439650	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Letter	Korean movies have become so popular that they are high on the export list to the film industries abroad to be remade for local audiences . Leading the pack is Hollywood , and we've recently seen The Lake House . The Thai film industry too took a Korean movie - 1997's # 1 Korean film , The Letter ( Pyeon Ji ) , and gave it their own treatment in Jod Mai Rak . I haven't watched the original , but looking at the result of this Thai effort , they aren't too far behind in the ability to make a melodramatic weepie too . Jod Mai Rak tells the story of two lonely people , a country boy called Ton ( Attaporn Teemakorn ) , and a city girl Dew ( Anne Thongprasom ) , who meet and found each other by chance at a Chiang Mai bus terminal , and as Fate would have it , they would come together after a semi-long distance courtship over the telephone . There are plenty of sweet moments interjected throughout the narrative , like the lingering shots of a bald plum tree which belongs to Ton , and the tender moments during their stay together in Chiang Mai , after personal tragedy made Dew ditch her shared apartment in Bangkok , and opt for the more rustic lifestyle in the countryside . From here , country boy teaches city girl how to live it up with the basic necessities ( well , she still brought over some city artifacts like the PC ) , and naturally lent itself to many moments that will melt your heart . But watching a movie like that isn't interesting , and you always know that there's something extra just waiting to come . Melodramas always have you paint the perfect blissful picture , before coming down with the all too familiar terminal illness plot device . The two star crossed lovers aren't spared this either , and the latter half of the movie see them battle their fears of not having be with each other for long . It's a story of remembrance , and not forgetting the good things in life , of moving on and cherishing the good times . It's impossible for someone not to feel at least a tear in the eye as the dramatics take their full effect , especially towards the end , though there is some redeeming bittersweet feel at the end of the movie . I found the use of the letters in the movie vaguely familiar , and possibly could have been used in other movies I've seen . It's nothing supernatural , and something which is simple , yet I know is highly effective in serving its purpose . Not that I think anyone would be crazy to do something like that in real life , probably will just either freak the other person out , or really prevent someone from truly moving on . The leads Anne Thongprasorn and Attaporn Teermakorn are believable as the lovers . Girls will probably swoon at Attaporn's portrayal of Ton , the real sensitive new age dude who can cook , has green thumbs , and has so much heart and positivity in life . Anne's Dew initially started out quite unlikable , at least to me , with her tendency to be spoilt and taking things much for granted and in a minor way , mistreating Ton perhaps ? But thankfully there is a character change as the movie progresses . Directed by Pa-oon Chantornsiri , Jod Mai Rak is a perfect date movie which centers much on the lives of the two lovers , at the expense of having some throwaway supporting characters . Then again , two's a company , and anything more is always unwelcome . Chiang Mai also makes for an awesome romantic place .
514727	317399	382357	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Land of Plenty	This is my maiden foray into the Singapore International Film Festival ( SIFF ) , and my first review of a film featured in the SIFF . The film tells a story of Lana , who is going to LA after her mother passed away , in search of her uncle . She has been travelling the world with her missionary father , and her last place of stay had been Tel Aviv . While we are shown the glistening skyline of LA , we are soon shown the poverty zone , and how Lana feels about leaving one warzone into another , that the war against poverty is not so much different from the world she had left . Her uncle Paul , a Vietnam war veteran exposed to the infamous Agent Orange , is now a self-possessed vigilante , playing his overly zealous part in homeland security , rigging his van into a one-stop travelling security surveillance van . ( Heck , even his handphone ringtone is the national anthem ! ) He randomly tails people deemed suspicious to him , and things get interesting when a man of Arab descent is spotted by him buying boxes of chemicals ( the irony of making a dirty bomb from a cleaning agent ) and later on , being gunned down by unknown suspects . To reach out to Paul , Lana had to play along at times , to get Paul to open up to her , as their initial meeting isn't really cordial , and it is of course difficult to strike up family conversation with relatives you have hardly seen all this while . But things take a turn when Paul finally wakes up to reality , and his futile investigative effort all comes crashing down for him . While there is little drastic character development , it is the subtle character representation that is key in this film . Paul represents the " ra-ra America " , those who are bent on protecting the homeland at all costs , those who are inept in collecting facts ( yeah , there's a dumpster diving scene which rocked ) and making decisions based on faulty intelligence . Lana , on the other hand , represents the rest of the world . The compassionate world , reaching out to diversity and trying their best in understanding this difference . It is no surprise that the filmmakers showcase the different attitudes that these 2 characters exude towards a Pakistani whom they meet towards the end . Good music is peppered throughout the movie , and I always appreciate films that introduce appropriate tunes for each scene that punctuates the entire atmosphere beautifully ( Think Cameron Crowe movies ) . And one poignant line in the film stuck to me as the film begins in LA and ends in Ground Zero , NY - if we can hear the 3000 souls asking us not to use their name in vain , as an excuse to kill more people . For those in Singapore who wish to catch this film , I don't think there is a repeat screening , so you might have to catch it on discs . And by the way , the lead actress looks like a cross between Audrey Tautou and Liv Tyler - so there .
515130	317399	364961	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Assassination of Richard Nixon	What will make a man snap , go out of control , and want to kill the President , by flying an airplane right into the White House ? While the setting of this tale is pre-911 , watching it in a post-911 era does send some unnerving chills down your spine . Life is bad for Sam Bicke . His American Dream is falling apart , starting with his family . He is separated from his wife , and she has custody of their 3 children . She has obviously moved on , and is unhappy whenever Sam visits her and the children , and even more angry when he sees her at her workplace . His moral values clashes with company culture - as a salesman he is expected to make the occasional white lie to sell products . But he subscribes to the moral belief that one should tell the truth , even in business . Needless to say , his quota is always at the bottom rung , and gets chided and belittled by fellow colleagues and his boss . He tries to start his own business , but is stuck with insane bureaucracy and suspected racism . At one stage he steals from his brother , who's also in the same line of business ( rubber tyres ) , and that plunged their blood relations even further down the gutter . Heck , even his political ideology he identifies with the Black Panthers also turn inconsequential , as the group gets clamped down . Frustrated by the current state of his being , he finally puts the blame on the " system " , as we see Richard Nixon on TV screens , giving his political speeches in his scandal laden presidency . Sam finally decides to take matters into his own hand to not just be a grain of sand on the beach , and this leads to an explosive ending where the pace of the film quickens . Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant , and is able to carry the entire weight of this film on his own shoulders . Playing a man with many facades and moods , he brings Sam Bicke to life with ease with his repertoire of acting skills . His co-stars put up commendable performances , albeit short ones . ( Can't get enough of Don Cheadle after his excellent Hotel Rwanda ) . I checked out this show in preparation of his other film The Interpreter , with yet another Australian actress ( His 21 Grams co-star Naomi Watts in this one , and Nicole Kidman in the other . . . lucky fella ! ) , so if you want to watch Sean showcase his acting ability in a recent non-mainstream film , you can consider this .
515024	317399	498311	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Re-Cycle	Be careful what you wish for , because sometimes , they just might come true , whether you like it to or not . A writer's inspiration can also be adapted from real life events , with a dash of dramatic license added to spice things up for the reader . And an environmental message which is worked quite effortlessly into the narrative , makes one wonder in awe too . Re-Cycle is the latest horror thriller from the acclaimed Pang Brothers , whose Bangkok Dangerous I had enjoyed tremendously . Perhaps an Asian answer to Hollywood's Wachowski Brothers with their flair for interesting visuals and stories which thread on many levels , Oxide and Danny Pang's latest movie stars Angelica Lee ( or Lee Sin-Je if you prefer ) , already having her fair share of spook fests in her filmography . Ting Yin ( Lee ) is a successful writer whose love stories are literary blockbusters . Infusing elements of her life into her stories , she gets troubled as she attempts to break genre and work on horror instead . And it is this introductory act that things really go bump in the dark , incorporating the Asian dark mood and eerie atmosphere which have become staples of horror movies this part of the world . Familiar scenes like long hair ( The Wig ? ) , water ( Ju-On ? ) , and dark frightening shadows make their necessary appearance , coupled with extremely loud music and screams and the right moments , I admit my heart skipped . But Re-Cycle took a different path thereafter . Gone are the horrific elements used to shock . and in comes a whole lot of atmosphere and computer generated graphics , designed to awe . The centre piece of a slum-like deserted street and dilapidated buildings , with its silently deserted streets , and then plenty of zombies , reminded me of yet another moody horror movie Silent Hill , with its fair share of graphics enhancement . Initially I thought that from the trailer , it looked like a carbon copy of Constantine's Hell sequence , but I was wrong , and I'm still amazed by Thailand's advancement in post production and computer wizardry competency - simply awesome . Stunning effects aside , the story progressed more into the thriller and mystery realms , tracking Ting Yin's desperation to escape from this unreal world , back to her own . It's like Alice in Wonderland , except that this is no childlike fantasy world with danger lurking at every corner . For those who have enjoyed Neil Gaiman's Mirrormask , this movie's story threads along the same lines in having the protagonist seeking an escape , while going from scene to scene , and place to place , encountering weird surreal locations , and different , out of this world characters . For those who disliked or found the narrative style of Mirrormask wanting , you might feel the same about Re-Cycle too . However , there is a strong , rational theme unifying these seeming disparate scenes and events . They're not just pretty for the sake of being pretty to look at , but ring home the obvious message on abandonment , through the plot device of re-cycling . Many strange scenes are crafted from this message , while at the same time , bringing a sense of familiarity for an audience to identify with . Therein lies the strength of this movie . Angelica Lee had plenty of room to showcase her acting skills - being frightened to her wits end , sharing emotional scenes , smelling of desperation or be it in a state of bewilderment , she carries the movie forward aptly , despite slower moments during certain sequences . My initial thoughts about the movie were not flattering , choosing to harp on the nicely done , yet familiar special effects , and scenes which were somewhat familiar in some other movies . But having pondered a little more into the storyline , I thought it was quite neat , and if not for the spooky introduction , I might just want to watch this movie again .
515567	317399	988047	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Traitor	It sure took a long time for this film to debut here , and if memory serves me right , it took almost a year , and the DVD has already been released . If not for a press screening already held , I would have thought that the film would be one of those that are difficult to pass by the censors and required some lengthy debate as to the merits for its theatrical release . That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner , with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists ' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom , Syriana , The Siege and Body of Lies , to name but a few films dealing with the topic . I am a keen admirer of Don Cheadle's film performance , especially in dramatic roles , and here he plays Samir Horn , a devout Muslim and US citizen caught up in a web of intrigue and international terrorism acts . We see how he employs his skills of bomb-making , honed from his US Special Operations days as an officer , and seemingly looks like a rogue , US domestic terrorist aiding foreign groups in their operations to harm the world . But there's more than meets the eye to Samir , and here's where Cheadle excels in putting that level of ambiguity into a role that raises moral questions about doing something for the " greater good " , no matter the costs . Chasing him around the world are FBI counter-terrorism agents Roy Clayton ( Guy Pearce ) and Max Archer ( Neal McDonough ) , who are clearly like fish out of water when operating outside their legal jurisdictions . Unfortunately for the two actors , their roles here as the downright good guys are always a step or two behind the terrorist cells , which in some ways mirror that in real life . Without good intelligence , you're always reactive , and it takes a lot to be on top of the game , especially when tactics employed are normally innovately discharged . We get to see a number of " no-brainer " tactics that the cells employ which are effective if you think about it , which makes it all the more dangerous should they be used because they actually can be . But the most dangerous game to be playing from the side of the good guys , is the refusal to share intelligence or to combine resource , drawing lines in the sand and setting up turfs . The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand , while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions , and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress . In some ways , this is like Infernal Affairs being played all over again . I suppose that without the balanced view and very verbatim statements made toward the end renouncing violence and misguided teachings , this film would probably not be given the green light . But it did , and presented a very though provoking thinking man's action thriller set in this age of cloak and dagger terrorism . Sure it has some loopholes and the unnecessary ( and unavoidable ) collateral damage , but watch this for the performance all round and an engaging storyline that might not keep you guessing all the way once the cat is out of the bag , but does enough .
514733	317399	381505	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Pretty Persuasion	I kinda liked this film for almost all the wrong reasons . It's politically incorrect and doesn't make any apologies for doing so , but yet demonstrates a notion that we can be bigots , and yet not be consciously aware of it . After all , it's what has already been internalized , but it becomes exposed quite naturally through our actions and dialogue . Evan Rachel Wood is the star of the movie . As Kimberly Joyce , she's the high school frat girl like Alicia Silverstone's Cher in Clueless , but in terms of character , she's on the other side of the spectrum . Way on the other side . She's looking for fame , and would do absolutely anything to obtain her 15 minutes worth . She's a temptress , a seductress , highly intelligent , and so manipulative , she can stab you in the back while smiling in front of you , with you none the wiser and probably still worshipping the ground she treads on . Which brings us back to the title , and makes you wonder if beautiful people can get away with almost anything . I guess it's probably almost human nature to be enchanted by the pretties , and anyone would most likely be lapping up at anything they say . It doesn't take much for a beautiful bitch to realize the power she wields on men who are drunk in her aura , and then to exploit this weakness of people around her . There are two more key reasons why I enjoyed the movie , besides being enchanted myself by the Kimberly character . The first is the dialogue in the movie - there's so much wit , and it's fast and laced with plenty of double entr√©es and satire , delivered in a deadpan manner by Rachel Wood no less , you would likely need to re-watch it again to grasp them all . The second is having Kimberly chaperon a newbie in school , an Arab girl called Randa ( Adi Schnall ) , raising some eyebrows as the religious girl gets exposed to pop culture and blatant insensitive racists remarks , and inevitably too becomes a pawn in the whole scheme of things , as does Kimberly's best friend Brittany ( Elisabeth Harnois ) discover that it's not always fine and dandy being the hunter , as there is always something or someone else higher above in the food chain . The host of supporting characters raised the movie to another notch . James Woods shines as the foul mouthed father of Kimberly , who sprouts words of wisdom peppered with colourful vulgar , racist remarks . Jamie King completes the household as the long suffering trophy wife / stepmother in the Joyce household , constantly bearing the brunt of insults hurled at her by Kimberly . At school , we have Ron Livingston as Percy Anderson , as the meek and mild mannered school teacher who indulges in role-playing games with the wife at home ( Selma Blair ) , and inadvertently becomes the target and public enemy # 1 of Kimberly and friends . And Jane Krakowski in a bimbotic role , stars as a news reporter who finds it increasingly difficult to stay objective when covering possibly the juiciest scandal to hit town . There's a sub theme running that touches on " saving face " , which is an issue to the successful in ensuring that their reputation does not get tarnished in the face of scandals , and is a trait that most Asians are familiar with . It's important that face is not ruined easily by careless actions , as face is something that is most difficult to build in an environment of shame . Having lost face and losing the faith to rebuild it , can lead people to an untimely sad demise . So if you're up for some scheming betrayal , and plenty of slimy tactics , if you want to observe how seemingly good intentions are actually poisoned barbs that kill slowly , then I hope I've already persuaded you enough to watch this flick .
514625	317399	492533	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Intimate	If I were to summarize this movie in a few words , this would be it : Serendipity with plenty of sex . Telling a story of two strangers who meet by chance in an elevator , The Intimate follows their journey through the day and night ( which doesn't seem to end by the way ) , as they discover about each other , and about themselves in the process . Kinda like Before Sunrise in its treatment , the lovers , nameless except known as Boy ( Jo Dong-Hyuk ) and Girl ( Sung Hyun - Ah ) , play the usual courtship mind games , playing coy , being aggressive , taking turns to bust each others chops as they fall into each other's arms . Sounds like your typical romance movie , no ? At certain points the usual elements are there , like plot devices romanticizing a bench and hand drawn pictures , and the mushy things lovers whisper to the ears of another . Clich√©d highlights include one needing to leave the country the next day , and the other being engaged to someone else , and now both of them , by Fate , are presented a chance to do something totally different . But in this story , it managed to take aged old questions of doubt , and weave a compelling movie around them . The basic question will be what is love . Is it supposed to be long drawn and lasting a lifetime , or is the feeling actually made up of short passionate bursts ? And after being with someone for so long , is it a question of being afraid to leave the comfort zone of familiarity , or does it boil down truly to faithfulness ? The nagging fear of being about to marry someone , and then you meet your soulmate - what do you do ? Blame the person for turning up in your life too late ? And it is somehow true that the longer you know someone , the more faults that you will find , and the question is , will you be able to live with those faults , or do you prefer to live in that constant crest of emotional highs and bailing out when the slightest inclination of such faults start to rear its head ? It helps that both leads are eye-candy , as they offer you a chance to answer some of those questions yourself if you were to put yourselves in their shoes and be offered the same set of temptations - here's what you currently have , and here's what someone else can offer . What would you do ? If there is a gripe , it'll be the one-dimensional fianc√© that somehow has to be demonized in order to make the other option all the more appealing . It's a relatively engaging movie , though watching the out takes while the end credits rolled made you appreciate the movie's direction a little more . While those scenes which were left out may be seen as more interesting , somehow I felt it would have disrupted the pace and dragged events rather than having it all compacted into a screen duration of 24 hours . It would have been a totally different look and feel altogether , but probably not for the better .
515213	317399	379786	8.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Serenity ( 2005 )	The back story of Serenity and its TV series Firefly is what stuff like soap opera is made of . Created by Joss Whedon , popular creator-scribe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel television series , the Firefly television series was yanked from the airwaves by Fox midway through its first season , but as all real life fairy tales go , the series was released on DVD , and became an instant cult classic . Hence , the movie was born given the built fan base . And having not watched the Firefly series , I think Serenity is a satisfyingly good sci-fi movie which can stand alone . Although it will take some getting used to the characters , it'll not take too long before you get into the swing of things to enjoy what this movie had to offer . Serenity refers to the Firefly class of spaceships in an era of the future where planets are colonized and banded together as an Alliance , with a band of rebels opposing the oppression of a totalitarian regime . Think of Star Wars scenario of an Empire with its Rebel Alliance , and Star Trek with its ship and crew in focus , combined . We follow the adventures of Captain Malcom Reynolds ( Nathan Fillion ) and his crew of merry men and women ( doctor , navigator , pilot , ex-lover etc ) as they undergo a rescue mission of one of their own , River Tam , who's a psychic turned dangerous weapon , or so they think . While they unravel the mystery and secrets of what River knows , they must outrun the ruthless Allaince's assassin who's after River , as well as fend off the deadly vicious creatures known as the Reavers . The Reavers are extremely dangerous folk , and I kinda liken them to Star Trek's Borg - they keep coming like zombies , and are known to rape and murder . The pacing is kept very tight , with witty dialogue flying all round . Humour is peppered throughout and you'll never know when it'll hit , even up to the very last frame ( no , I'm not kidding here ) . The production sets , though most are CGI , are really very pretty to look at , and the advanced world they live in , is an amalgamation of American and Chinese , so much so that the characters also spout ( sometimes intelligible ) Chinese phrases . There are memorable moments in the movie , though the action fights are quite ordinary , save for River's battle with the Reavers which seem to beat Aeon Flux's and Ultraviolet's hands down . Her storyline did thread very closely to resemble that of Leeloo's in Fifth Element though . Filled with deep characterization , Serenity will make you want to get your hands on the TV series to indulge in more adventures of the space crew . After watching this 2 hour movie , it's no wonder why Firefly has fast become a cult favourite . Too bad the movie didn't get a wide release locally ( only a GV Surprise Screening and another one-off at Prince ) , which will probably serve to extend its popularity here . Good , interesting Sci-Fi , must watch . Code 1 DVD comes chock full of extras . There's a full length feature film commentary by Joss Whedon , plenty of deleted scenes with Whedon's commentary , lots of outtakes , an laced - with-humour introduction by Whedon , three documentaries - 1 . Future History : The Story of Earth That Was , 2 . Re-lighting the Firefly , and 3 . What's in a Firefly , and an easter egg too , which showed the creation of that weird Fruity Oaty bar advertisement containing the sublime message ala The Manchurian Candidate .
514579	317399	461770	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Enchanted	How does she know , you love her ? Probably by bringing her to watch Enchanted , a movie with the words " chick flick " rubber stamped all over it . I've got to admit my friend offered to hook me up on a blind date with a hot chick because she wanted to watch this movie , and I had unsuccessfully persuaded him to bring her out on this movie date himself . Anyway if you're reading this , you should , because it has a winning formula ! The trailers would have suggested that this was going to be a madcap time , with a Disney movie poking fun at most of its classics , drawing inspiration from , and then taking a mickey out of it . You have a princess-wannabe Giselle ( Amy Adams ) , an animated character modeled quite generically from beauties like Snow White , Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty et al . Thrown in a Prince Charming named Edward ( James Marsden ) , and his evil stepmother The Queen ( Susan Sarandon ) , with evil hag disguise to boot . And with her greed to hold onto the Kingdom , she prevents the love-at-first-sight / song couple from marrying , and banishes Giselle to The Big Apple . With zero help and all the wrong moves and polite demeanor , she finds herself in the unlikely friendship of Robert Philip ( Patrick Dempsey ) and his daughter Morgan ( Rachel Covey ) . And here's when the movie starts to come alive with its inane scenes drawn from the Disney archives to bring on the chuckles , down to full blown musical numbers that are just plain charming . If Disney animated movies of yester-years have lovey dovey songs ( listen carefully to the background music to spot some recognizable Disney tunes ) , poisoned apples , dragons , henchmen , magic mirrors ( ha ! ) , witches , glass slippers , gorgeous costumes and cute furry animals , this movie has them all . But aside from the predictable elements that make a Disney cartoon a Disney cartoon , it boiled down to what's core in such fairy tales : True Love's Kiss . The one thing that every Disney female character yearn for from their hero . It's a typical fairy tale plot , but in its fish out of water storyline , it offered a clash of two different worldly views on the notion of love . For Giselle , it's always been happily ever afters after a shotgun meeting - boy meets girl , girl loves boy , they get married and live in a huge castle . In the real world we're so familiar with , Robert epitomizes the modern day notions of long drawn courtships , the trying to find out everything you can about the other half , for compatibility reasons , the contemplation whether you can live forever ( which is such a long time ) with the other half , and the option to divorce always hanging overhead when things don't work out . It's a clash of two different perspective from different worlds , and needless to say opposites do attract , henceforth providing a sort of dilemma as both parties are to be married to their respective partners . Amy Adams is Enchanted , without whom the movie will fall flat . She sings the songs , dances the joyous dance , squeals in delight at every new experience , and is the typical bambi-eyed beauty who finds positivity in everything , even when they are heading south . I guess I'm attracted to optimism , and no doubt , her character of hope had naturally struck a chord in me ( same thing goes for Kirsten Dunst's Claire in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown ) . When she opens her mouth and sings to invoke the innate powers of all Disney heroines , the ability to charm animals from afar to do her bidding , you've gotta see this one as it just cracks you up with the type of beings she conjures in New York . In her own ditzy manner , her Giselle will undoubtedly find a soft spot in your heart . Playing her two leading men are Patrick Dempsey as the world-weary divorce lawyer whose pessimism is soon to take an hard knock from Giselle's infectious attitude towards love , and James Marsden as the very himbo-like Prince Edward , all brawn , a naturally glib tongue , and perhaps a hint of an airhead ( Is it me , or are female characters these days becoming more Alpha-typed ? ) . Susan Sarandon got top billing too in this movie , and while she looks quite the part as the evil Queen , it's a pity that her screen time had been severely limited , lending more of her voice instead rather than appearing in the flesh . Throwaway characters include Timothy Spall as the no good henchman Nathaniel , and an animated chipmunk Pip ( noises by the director Kevin Lima himself in the NY version ) which seems to be the precursor to more of the same once Alvin and the Chipmunks hit the screen next month . In true Disney fashion , Enchanted goes back to basics with its message , that there must always be hope that one day you'll meet your true love , whether they drop in from the sky , or crawl out of the sewer . Almost a no-brainer choice for dating couples looking for fluffy chick flick entertainment .
515487	317399	1028528	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Death Proof	After the relative success of his homage to kung fu with his Kill Bill movies , Quentin Tarantino turned his sights to the 70s exploitation movies with Grindhouse : Death Proof . However , for us outside the US , we do not get the Grindhouse double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and a host of easter egg styled trailers , but rather we get the longer cut of both movies . Many have said that Planet Terror proved to be superior to Death Proof , but without watching the other , I thought Tarantino's offering was pretty decent stuff . Perhaps his detractors loathed how he made references to and probably paid homage to his own movies and signature style . This spelt E-G-O , and doesn't go down well , with its plenty of foot fetish shots , reminiscent of foot massages , and if you pay attention enough , you'd spot and hear about the Big Kahuna burgers , familiar tunes over the ringtones , yellow and black striped colour schemes , the alpha female type chicks , and loads and loads of vulgarity laced dialogue just about everything under the sun , with characters mouthing off in cars or around a dining table . That about sums up stuff from Reservoir Dogs all the way to Kill Bill . But Death Proof is a different animal altogether . Being his own cinematographer , QT has full control over the shots that he makes , and injects plenty of sleaze into his story - buxomy , leggy girls in tight tees and perky butts peeking out of hot pants , flaunting their power of sexuality in alpha-female styled attitudes . It's actually two different segments in one movie , each being quite different from the other in terms of themes , and style . The first half introduced us to characters like Arlene ( Venessa Ferlito ) , Shanna ( Jordan Ladd ) , Jungle Julia ( Syndey Poitier ) and Pam ( Rose McGowan ) , who end up in a bar doing their own thing ( read : plenty of dialogue and flirting with the camera ) . We get introduced quite slowly to the psycho Stuntman Mike ( Kurt Russell , with Snake Plissken styled scar ) , who while on one hand befriends the girls , but on the other hand , we are just waiting for the action to begin . Being a stuntman , his car is " death proof " , meaning it's rigged like stunt cars that provide protection for its driver , and nothing else . And if you're twiddling your thumbs for some action to take over , then be prepared to wait a bit . You see , despite what you think Death Proof might be , it's nothing about the action , not at least until the driver takes the wheel . And when QT lets it rip , out comes the blood and gore , exploitation style . Given the fake jump cuts , bad editing and scratchy film stock , it becomes near impossible to find out just which parts were censored for the local M18 version . It does seem to make sense still and flow well , but you can probably bet your last dollar that some bits were removed . On the other hand , we have stuff like the lap dance kept intact , which was omitted from the double bill Grindhouse . Win some and lose some . The second half of the movie is a different story altogether . For the most parts , the 70s style gets junked , maybe because it got tiring , or it's too tedious to replicate the cheesy special effects over to this story arc , where the hunter becomes the hunted . There's plenty of action , but could I say it's somewhat repetitive and lacks that oomph , until the final moments where you probably might go " that's awesomely cool " . Other than that , it's more of the same , with more eye candy courtesy of Mary Elizabeth Winstead ( Sky High , Final Destination 3 ) , Rosario Dawson , Tracie Thorns and Zoe Bell , with plenty more QT styled dialogue of pop irrelevance . While stylistically the movie might want to try and resemble low budgeted 70s exploitation movie , Death Proof juxtaposes certain current day elements into itself , making it somewhat messy with gizmos like cell phones and portable music players . What put a smile on my face though ( besides the beautiful ladies of course ) , is Kurt Russell's two-faced Stuntman Mike performance . He can be nonchalant one minute , oozing indifference , and in the next , he can be so silently deranged you'd rather choose to leap from the vehicle , if you had a means to that is . Or he can be the classic road rage driver , before realizing he has bitten off more than he could chew . It's been some time having Russell on the big screen , and I thought he did fine , despite not being QT's first choice for the role . Ultimately , just one warning about the movie - expect plenty of dialogue , and I mean plenty , with characters talking about sexuality and about people who never appear on screen , and if you can't stand irrelevance , then steer clear . The action comes on in limited spurts , so if that's what you're after , then savour every moment when the gear shifts into overdrive . The loopy soundtrack too is a bonus , and adds some authentic exploitative flavour . QT did not manage to outdo himself , but still managed to capture the correct spirit in those films he wants to emulate . If Rodriguez's installment is as they say far superior than QT's , then I'd say bring on Planet Terror already !
514895	317399	856008	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Sharkwater	Blame it on its many teeth , giving it a perception that it can cut through flesh and bone . And no thanks to movies like Jaws , which has set that perception in stone that sharks are extremely dangerous creatures that have one mission , and that's to eradicate human swimmers from the sea . How do you try and convince what is generally " accepted truths " by the masses ? You go at it small , with persistence , that fire in the belly to fuel your crusade in re-educating the masses , and the best example being yourself taking the plunge to try and set things right , one step at a time . That's what Rob Stewart did , in trying to change the incorrect mindsets we have of sharks , by demonstrating to us how they are actually more afraid of us , and making a documentary film out of it to spread the good message . Don't let the poster fool you into thinking it's a fictional , narrative film . It's a documentary , and like most documentaries , it has an agenda to cover . Here , Stewart's agenda is simple , to talk about shark conservation , and the importance of the ocean ecosystem . Yes , it's a myriad of topics that can spiral out of control , but strangely enough , the key points are all presented in a compelling manner , against very beautiful underwater images of marine life , the very life he is seeking , on the bigger picture , to try and save . Naturally , one doesn't talk about saving the sharks without touching on the demand side of things , and that is the perceived value of a delicacy called the Shark's Fin Soup , which is a staple in any self-respecting Chinese restaurant . While the usual illegal poaching through long lining and footage of skinning are aimed to shock an audience into the cruelty of the way the sharks are destroyed , the biggest impact made here are the frivolous statements given by the chairman of a prominent brand of canned shark's fin soup . You will definitely chuckle at his arguments , or the lack thereof in the intelligence department , as he's made to look quite animated , and not in good light , deliberately of course . Some might feel that the movie did seem a little like an ego-trip for Rob Stewart , with himself being featured quite prominently in many scenes , but I thought it's a given because it is a trip along a journey he's bringing us , and that's why we see some of the inherent risks involved in the many conservationists efforts as they go out to try and stop , with limited budget and resources , the perennial problem of trying to stem out the supply side of things . Naturally , it's never easy with the illegal trade , as shady corporations , characters and corrupt governments are almost always involved , because that's how the activity can thrive , and it boils down to obscene amount of profits to be made by all parties . Through documentaries that touch on current hot topics involving the environment , it's hard to tell how effective they can be . I guess a good measure if how convinced you are to the cause , and from the documentary , try to reinforce the message yourself to your peers . Simple actions done by a few , can go a long way , and I guess the simplest of ways is to start from yourself . An Inconvenient Truth has made me more diligent in electricity utilization , and now Sharkwater has convinced me to layoff the shark's fin soup , whether they come in cans , or presented in wedding dinners . I have a choice , and I choose not to consume it . You might laugh at the futility of my actions , or want to take my share , but go ahead please , as I'm exercising my choice , a choice which you have too . Watch Sharkwater . You might be convinced by the arguments for the cause too . If not , it's still an educational trip in learning more about sharks and the ocean ecosystem , with a stark warning not to tamper with the natural order of Mother Nature . Highly recommended , naturally .
514660	317399	77343	8.0	A Nutshell Review : They Call Her . . . Cleopatra Wong	" She purrs like a kitten , makes love like a siren . This side of the Pacific , she's the meanest , deadliest , and sexiest secret agent " That's the tagline for the movie , and it's Singapore's answer to the 70s female action powerhouses like Charlie's Angels . Cleopatra Wong ( Doris Young aka Marrie Lee ) is an international Interpol agent whose mission in this film is to crack an illegal counterfeiting group whose sole objective is to destabilize the currencies of ASEAN countries Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , Thailand and the Philppines . Sounds diabolical , doesn't it ? And it's a job only a cosmopolitan agent like Cleo Wong can handle , as she jet sets from Singapore to Hong Kong to the Philippines , hot on the trail of these crooks , manufacturing fake currencies in a convent . She even shows her leadership qualities in leading an all male group of agents on the attack of the crooks hideout against machine gun-totting fake nuns . Shown as the " Female Big Boss " , the montage at the beginning shows the abilities of Cleo Wong as top fighter and archer , whom even Robin Hood is no match for with her simultaneous firing of 3 arrows , blowing up a helicopter in the process ( yes , they did blow up a helicopter , back in the 70s for this show ! ) With older films , what catches the eye is usually the environment and the state of development of Singapore at that time . Here , we viewed the Paya Lebar International Airport , an old 70s Mercedes Benz , and the city skyline which has many buildings noticeably absent . We go from the mainland to Sentosa via cable car , following Cleo's footsteps , and come across vastly different and sparse beaches that we're unfamiliar with today . Local actor / DJ Brian Richmond also had a role in this film as Cleo's Singapore boss . I overheard the people around me laugh and shake their heads on the impossibility of some scenes - like Cleo Wong single-handedly taking on 3 wrestlers ( one of whom is local famous wrestler Mehar Singh ) , and leaping ( yes , leaping without aid ) over tall walls in escape . Or the scenes in which the raid on the hideout using guns resulted in prolonged and painful ( no pun intended ) death scenes . I suppose one must take into context the sign of the times , where kung-fu action was punctuated with exaggerated sound effects , and where the slightest punch will effect in maximum flying damage . All in all , it's a fun film which one shouldn't miss . This was the film that was produced for an international audience , and one which resulted in catching the eye of Quentin Tarantino ! Cleopatra Wong definitely lived up to her tagline . Those interested in catching this film , there will be additional screenings at The Arts House on 22 Aug 05 Mon 2130hrs and 23 Aug 05 Tue 1900hrs .
515573	317399	220644	8.0	A Nutshell Review : The Mission	Many have lauded The Mission as a classic , and I don't deny that . However , as the unofficially loose precursor to Johnnie To's recent movie Exiled , The Mission did seem quite dated , but you can be dead sure that many of Exiled's plot points , characterization and stylistic influences , get established as far back to this 1999 movie . A triad leader , Brother Lung ( Eddy Ko ) , survives an assassination attack , and to protect oneself , you'll get together an A-Team of your merry men as bodyguards , entrusting your life to the skill of their gunmanship . His brother Frank ( Simon Yam ) gathers this team , consisting of your day to day average working professionals - Curtis ( Anthony Wong ) , Roy ( Francis Ng , somehow credited as Francis Wong ) , Shin ( Jackie Lui ) , Mike ( Roy Cheung ) , and James ( played by the ever reliable Lam Suet , sans pencil thin moustache ) . While they are barbers , gangsters , valets and technical experts , they are as deadly with a loaded gun , and coordinate extremely well as a team , only that they don't know it yet . Naturally there are existing cliques amongst the five , and their rawness in working together resulted in a partial failure of their very fist mission - the assassins escape , we journey together in their mission to protect , and see first hand how they command respect of each other , and how they befriend one another . In other words , the practice of the triads code of brotherhood and camaraderie , in trusting each other too with their lives , as they seek an end to their mission , to return to their normal lives . The Mission is a visual treat to action fans , though as I mentioned , the action itself might look dated . What's key here , and extremely well done , is the buildup . The anticipation of the prey , the feeling of the unknown , the entire setup for the kill . Shootouts occur in a narrow alleyway , and in an abandoned warehouse amongst others , but my favourite would be the one in the mall . It might be strange that as a protection detail , they chose to leave in the open , and when the crowd is absent . Perhaps it's easier to spot suspicious persons ? One thing's for sure , to enjoy the suspense , forget about the why and the what if questions ( Where are the security guards ? Where are the police ) , but just soak in the moment . I can't get enough of those ultra cool poseur shots , and the ones at the shopping mall were probably the best in the movie . The somewhat trippy , somehow happy theme track made it seem a little awkward accompanying the plenty suspenseful build up , but strangely it all worked , even when it's used for light hearted moments . Written by long time collaborator Yau Nai-hoi ( who this year had made his directorial debut with Eye in the Sky ) , the tale is not a gun battle a minute story , but a look at the code of brotherhood amongst the men - do they follow orders to a T because their boss orders it , or do they have it inside them to do what their heart tells them ? If you've watched Exiled , this conflict amongst the team already had its roots here , and watching The Mission in hindsight , you could never had guessed that this theme could alone could spin off into its own separate storyline in Exiled . My advice would be to watch The Mission and Exiled as a double bill - fans out there would probably not get enough ! I'm sure I will pop both the DVDs into my player soon for back to back viewings ! If you , like me , have watched Exiled first , then this movie surely is not to be missed . The Code 3 DVD by Mei Ah Entertainment isn't really fantastic , but I suppose for the price I paid , you don't come to expect a chock load of extras . You get a choice of either the Cantonese language track or the Mandarin track , in either Dolby Digital or Dolby Surround 5 . 1 . However at times , the audio does seem erratic and at certain points in dialogue , the audio level will fluctuate inconsistently . Subtitles come in traditional or simplified Chinese , and English . I watched the DVD with the English subtitles on , and though it's fairly good , there were minor spelling typos spotted every now and then . A letterbox version , the visual transfer isn't pristine as well , as it can get quite noisy and sometimes turn out to be rather blocky . As mentioned , it's a bare bones version , consisting of a Data Bank with a very scantily written synopsis which can also be found on the back cover of the DVD sleeve , and the Cast and Crew credits , which can be obtained from the actual end credits from the movie . The Data Bank comes in both English and Mandarin texts . Besides the stylish theatrical trailer ( 1min 25sec ) with no dialogue , but just the pulsating soundtrack from the movie , a chapter selection is included ( 9 chapters in total ) , and a " Best Buy " section featuring the trailer for Ringo Lam's movie " Victim " starring Lau Ching Wan and Tony Leung Ka Fai .
514534	317399	368909	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Ong Bak	Now this is rare , am actually reviewing a movie I watched on TV . But how can I miss Ong Bak when Tom Yum Goong is around the corner , and I'd actually missed this movie during it's run at the local theatres ! I'm not going to go through the details of the story - it's a simple plot about an ancient Buddha statue called Ong Bak , whose head is stolen by artifact hunters , and it's up to local village folk hero Ting who volunteers to retrieve it back from Bangkok . There , he meets up with some friends and embarks on a fight-laden journey to the bowels of the city in order to fulfill his mission . What's appealing is that the main lead , played by Tony Jaa , impresses with his brand of real kung-fu . Make that Muay-Thai boxing , the real deal . He's today's Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan , the latter being older and wanting to move on to drama . So Tony Jaa should claim the mantle of Asia's kung-fu king from Jackie Chan , and perhaps Jet Li too . Jaa's reflexes is lightning fast , and martial arts moves , lethal and deadly . I can never forget the strong punches , knees , elbows , and the feints with the kicks . Awesome , violent stuff there . No holds barred . But that's not all , besides martial arts , he's quite nimble and shows off his skills with some acrobatics during a chase scene along the back streets of Bangkok . The runs , squeezes , side splits , jumping side splits , under and sliding splits . Wow . The scenes get repeated in slow motion and in different angles , but I'm not a bit disturbed by the " show-offy " sequences . It's the real - no wires , no stunt doubles , all Jaa ! And as if to emulate a typical Jackie Chan movie , there's always that bit of humour some of the acrobatic scenes , the tuk-tuk chase , and also courtesy of a sidekick . But when it comes down to the fighting arena , it's all dead serious action , which many action fans will definitely enjoy . Tom Yum Goong , I'm already in the queue !
514711	317399	330373	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire	Just to get it straight , I have not read a single line in a Harry Potter Book . Not that I don't want to , but because I don't have the time . Probably when I finally watched all the movies would I consider and find time to read what JK Rowling had originally intended . So , at least you know that my review is solely based on the cinematic franchise . And I'm glad to say that this movie had lived up to its hype of being darker and more adult . Gone are the muggles ( hardly see any now ) which opened each HP movie before ( with added comedy , now thrown out ) , and you're plunged straight into the thick of action with the Quidditch World Cup . Which turns into a massacre of sorts , signaling the inevitable of the evil Lord Voldemort . Not that the muggles are left out on purpose , but if you had taken a look at this book's length , it's no surprise that unnecessary subplots need not get translated to screen . Stick with the main plot , and trim it down to a more palatable 2hr 45min movie . But with so much going on screen , you will hardly realize the length of time in which you butt is on a cinema seat . So what's the main plot you say ? It's the Tri-Wizards tournament , a potentially deadly series of 3 games which pit the skills of the wizards from 3 schools against each other . The winner will be crowned with eternal glory . But something seemed strange when Harry Potter somehow got nominated by the Goblet of Fire to participate , thus bringing the number of contestants to 4 , and breaking the age limit set in this tournament . As usual , there is always a major mystery that runs throughout the movie - the motive behind his nomination and taking part in the Tri-Wizards tournament , which gets solved in the end with the introduction of a twist ( which may not be a twist for those who've read the books ) . So while Harry is surprised and becomes the reluctant hero , he has to grapple with first loves and crushes , while trying to convince best friend Ron that it wasn't his intention to gain eternal glory and therefore rigged his nomination for the tournament . Great care is given to make the tournament come alive with its special effects , and to that , it's faultless . While we didn't see the other dragons in action , the Hungarian species ( no dragons were harmed in the making of this movie , says the end credits ) which challenged Potter could be one of the best action sequences in Goblet of Fire . However , with the intense focus on this , something's gotta give way , and sadly , it's the relationship between Harry , Ron and Hermione . Not that they don't get to interact , but the camaraderie and the bickering these folks endeared themselves to are somehow sorely missed . Goblet of Fire seemed more like a one-man show ( Harry Potter's ) , while the other two become peripheral characters . Quite a pity . But the actors Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson and Rupert Grint still delivered , and with them growing up in real time , adds a dimension of maturity to the cult characters they play . So much is said about Radcliffe's half nude scene ( with a character from a past movie ) , and of Cho Chang , but what probably iced the cake was Ralph Fiennes ' appearance as Lord Voldemort . One word - chilling ! One scene did irk me though , and that is the careless editing at the prom / ball scene . One minute Harry and Ron were sulking at the table , with Hermione obviously in cloud nine with the company of Viktor Krum , the next minute they're bickering and she's crying . While I know what they are trying to get at , and hint at a possible jealousy between Ron and Hermione , the editing was poorly done and was just jarring , disrupting the pace and flow . I didn't figure why they would want to scrimp on that scene , what's a few minutes more in a long movie , or they could take it out altogether . Nonetheless , I dare say this is the best Harry Potter movie to date , though some would disagree with my opinion that the movies have seemed to better itself with each sequel . Bring on the Order of the Phoenix !
514558	317399	200465	9.0	A Nutshell Review : The Bank Job	If I remember it rightly , the very first time I saw Jason Statham star in a movie , it was in Guy Ritchie's Snatch , and since then he's had his fair share of crime capers ranging from the remake of The Italian Job where he starred as Handsome Rob , to mindless , high octane action movies like The Transporter series where he's the star vehicle ( pardon the pun ) . While these movies can't possible earn him any action awards , you can't deny the fact that this guy's pretty charismatic in his own right , and I've no qualms about watching him play characters on either side of the fence , taking on his opponents in Crank or War , holding his own opposite Jet Li . While we await for the next installment of The Transporter or Crank , or The Brazilian Job , his The Bank Job sure took longer than expected to make its way to our shores , where the DVD should be released later this week . But as always , I'd recommend to watch this bank caper on the big screen . Don't expect plenty of Statham's signature moves when he takes on his opponents here , as he relies pretty much on his wits in order to survive a web of tangled intrigued where a simple open and shut case of a bank heist , turned out to be much larger than his team could digest , involving , check this out - high ranking government officials , the royal family , the British secret service , local neighbourhood cops , local neighbourhood crooked cops , gangsters , brothel owners , a society rebel , and an old flame . Phew ! Based loosely on the Baker Street Llyods Bank robbery in 1971 , Statham stars as Terry Leather , a two-bit lowly crook who's given an opportunity by Martine Love ( Saffron Burrows ) to break into the said bank , given inside information about the bank's security systems , and unknown to Leather , having the heist unofficially sanctioned by people in the right places . The job is simple , to break into the bank vault where the safe deposit boxes are , and make away with everything inside . But of course the real value lies in some incriminating photographs found within the boxes , and I thought this played out like The Inside Job . Only that it doesn't primarily take place from within the bank most of the time . The Bank Job covers a much larger spectrum , of conspiracies and trust issues between the members of the heist , as well as between shady characters who each have their own agenda of self - preservation . With plenty of dirty little secrets hidden snugly inside those safe deposit boxes , their respective owners while having a sense of fear permeate through their bones upon hearing the news , more so want to uncover the culprits , and recover their assets . It tells of the unwanted trouble and attention brought towards the perpetrators , as they realize that their apparently simple job , turns out to be a Pandora's box . If this was enacted based exactly on case files , then you can't help but to chuckle at how sometimes Fate and just plain silly luck would shine upon the players of the game , and enable coincidental circumstances to happen in order to have everything work out in a certain favour . And in either half of the story , from the enactment to the untying of the knotty situation they're stuck in , The Bank Job fulfills in keeping things light , funny , and given the many shenanigans that politicians get themselves into , it just reminds you that some things don't change . Those looking for elaborate plans and probes in heist movies Ocean Eleven style will be disappointed , but if you're looking for something leaning toward spy versus spy stuff and one-upmanship , with a classic underdog story to boot , then The Bank Job should already be in your must-watch list this week !
515307	317399	378475	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Bayside Shakedown 2	I've watched Bayside Shakedown 1 a few years back , and enjoyed it thoroughly , so there isn't any reason not to catch the sequel when it's in town . For those who do not know , this show is set in a small Tokyo police precinct , where cops actually perform routine community policing without arms , and the sexy investigative stuff are always handled by the Metropolitan police . This devision of course gives rise to the exploration of politics within the police force , some of which are not subtly put across in the movie - which provokes thought . However , the movie doesn't come across as preachy or heavy , as it's always lightened by the ( sometimes one dimensioned ) characters , the light hearted moments , and camaraderie amongst them . As always , the movie starts off with its regular catchy theme song interspersed with footage of current going-ons . With murder being the main anchor of investigations , other sub-investigations include the biter , the family of pickpockets and a secret lover of the commander of the precinct . Naturally , all the loose ends will be tied neatly when they all come together at one point in the show . Amongst the politics discussed here is on women leadership , in the name of equal opportunity - could we be biased and blinded by policy to allow the inept to lead ? Even though in my opinion , this is a Japanese movie , and the culture at times may be chauvanistic , it does provide some thought provoking moments during the show , or did the producers / writers cop out at the end of it all ? For those who do not understand Japanese , no worries , there are good subtitles , and it doesn't matter if you have watched the first part , or the drama serial - the good looking cast ( male and female ) should be able to sustain you through this enjoyable flick .
515007	317399	449059	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Little Miss Sunshine	This is today's GV Surprise Screening . For their debut feature length film , directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris probably couldn't ask for a better script - Little Miss Sunshine is a comedic drama which has plenty of heart , even though the characters are misfits put together in a dysfunctional family . But wait , before you roll your eyes at yet another story with quirky characters , this one probably proved itself to be relatively superior given its easy going delivery , never taking itself too seriously with the messages it tried to put across , and the cast is a joy to behold . Telling the story of the Hoover family's journey cross-country to bring their young daughter to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant , it's an insane road trip movie as well in their yellow family mini-van . Abigail Breslin first made her debut in M Night Shyamalan's Signs as Mel Gibson's daughter , and here she's the wide-eyed adorable child who will just tug at your heartstrings - you'll probably be sympathizing with her character's ( mis ) fortune with a family like hers . But there's where the fun is , no ? The more recognizable actors here will be Steve Carrell ( The 40 Year Old Virgin ) , as her gay scholarly uncle , and Toni Collette ( In Her Shoes ) as her mom . Rounding up the cast are Greg Kinnear as motivational-inspirational speaker Dad , Paul Dano as her brother who had taken a vow of silence , and Alan Arkin as coke-sniffing , foul - mouthed grandfather who dotes on her . While the opening might take its time to set the scene , once the family gets together there's no holding back . The dialogues and interactions between characters are fast and snappy , and each character's given enough screen time to showcase their tribulations and respective resolution . Which I found to be deftly done both in script and direction . There was one major loophole spotted , but nothing to mar your enjoyment of the movie . What I totally liked about the movie , is by the end of it , there's this warm fuzzy feeling that you'll feel about the message brought across , that the strength of family lies in sticking together , and through that , any adversary can be defeated , any troubles overcome . Anything else doesn't matter so long as there's unity , and the movie shows this pretty nicely - the gem of self-discovery together , and the getting out of the rut with support from one another . The crowd favourite is definitely the finale , which will more than likely to blow you away as it comes rather unexpectedly , and raises a few eyebrows too . At the screening , almost everyone was clapping and cheering , and the last time I experienced that kind of joy , was in the finale of Kinky Boots , which on hindsight , is similar in the kind of feeling it evokes from you . Though I must add that it was kind of unnerving somewhat watching the young performers prance around with their fake plastic smiles , stiff hair and loads of makeup . In life there are winners and there are losers . Little Miss Sunshine , is definitely a winner . Go watch !
515138	317399	371246	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Spanglish	I admire filmmakers who manage to explore powerful relationships and character development in a tight two hours , and Spanglish falls into this category perfectly . As the name goes , " Spanglish " is a combination of two words - Spanish and English , and is one of the major themes covered in this film , which is the clash of cultures , and the fear of dilution of cultural values . Paz Vega plays Mexican ( illegal ) immigrant housekeeper Flor , to an All American family , Mr and Mrs Clasky , played by Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni . They have 2 children Bernice and Georgie , and live with Tea's mother in a rich suburb . All seems well at first , but cracks start to appear as the story develops , as Paz discovers during the course of her work . The father is self deprecating as he is easy going , the mother is neurotic most times and imposes her wishes on the children ( especially the chubby daughter , whom she thinks must lose weight ) , the daughter upset with her mum for that expectation of her , a son who sings his grandmother's jazz oldies , and an alcoholic grandmother . A large part of the narrative takes place during the summer home , with major character development and relationships take over as the center-stage in this film . It is natural that the interactions between the characters develop from what it was in the beginning , to what it is at the end . Some turn for the better , while others just couldn't be . The importance of family and family values are explored . I will attempt to dissect the major relationships : John and Deborah Clasky : As husband and wife , it seems that their relationship isn't that good to begin with . With his easy going nature , John tends to give in to Deborah on a lot of things . Deborah expects her husband to not be the " good guy " to the kids , but to be in agreement with her on issues she deems as important and in her opinion , correct for the kids . Their relationship gets put to the test when one of the commits adultery , while the other is unwittingly being tempted into his own . John and Flor : As employer employee , they develop mutual respect for one another when they realize that they share similar values . To communicate with John , she takes up self-study English lessons , and their friendship progressed to mutual liking . They share the same parental anxiety and have frequent honest conversation expressing their thoughts . However , they develop feelings for each other , and find difficulty on where to draw the line between their ever increasing desire to be close . When the line is crossed , do you call it quits because it's the correct thing to do ? The last 30 minutes of the film is tinged with sweetness from this blossoming romance which couldn't develop further by virtue of principles . You are left wondering , what if ? Deborah and Cristina , Flor's daughter : When Deborah entices and unwittingly seduces Cristina into the all American lifestyle , so much so as even lying to her mum . Deborah is taken to Cristina because she is what her daughter could probably never be - smart , thin and beautiful . Cristina , on the other hand , enjoys Deboarh's company and attention because , hey , it's the American Dream , no ? Flor and Cristina : The movie is narrated by Cristina , from the time when she was little and her father walks out of the home , the hardships that mother and daughter endured through their journey to the USA , and her understanding of her mother's hardship with work to bring her up singlehandedly . Flor is understandably protective of her daughter's wellbeing , and especially in teacher her correct values and her heritage . She becomes jealous when Deborah , in her eyes , start to become more important to her daughter , and sometimes envious of the material wealth that Deborah showers on Cristina that Flor can never ever provide for . Flor fears that her child will be " hijacked " by Deborah . Deborah and her daughter Bernice : Her daughter at times resents the attention that her mum is giving Cristina , as she knows that she could never be thin as expected by mum . She has fears comparisons . Bernice and Flor : Flor starts off as work being strictly work , and no intervention into the family affairs . But she felt compelled to help when Bernice feels upset when Deborah subconsciously puts her down , most of the time subtle digs at her weight . Flor becomes Bernice's confidante in that sense , and John points out to her the hypocritical ways in which she disallows Deborah to treat her own daughter Cristina in similar ways . That scene between John , Flor and Cristina is comedic at times , but powerful nonetheless . Other relationships too long for this review to cover , and also they are quite minor , but at the end of the show , most relationships stay intact because blood runs thicker than water . The main casts excelled in their performance , but I like to single out Adam Sandler . He has demonstrated that he is capable and comfortable doing drama , instead of the madcap comedic characters we associate him with . I hope he does films of different genres to highlight his capability as a serious actor . Also catching my attention in a cameo is Sideways ' Thomas Haden Church . This is a touching drama with an ending that some might deem as heart-wrenching , but I highly recommend this film .
514950	317399	230591	9.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) One Day in September ( 1999 )	With the word and controversy out on Steven Spielberg's Munich , instead of settling for a Hollywood drama of the terrorist event that faithful day of the Olympics , you might want to learn more from this Oscar winning documentary . This documentary uses real footage throughout , with archived news reels , pictures , photos ( of the dead , shot , burnt , otherwise ) , and interviews with family members . But their real coup would be to have interviewed the one and only surviving terrorist who partook in the horror against the spirit of the Olympics . It also provides those born after 1972 , or too young to remember , a look at the events surrounding that day - from the Olympic organizers who are too arrogant to suspend the games , the indifference of the athletes in the Olympic Village , the lack of adequate security ( as compared to today ) , to the politics behind the entire affairs . Perhaps what will rile you are the West German's botched attempt to rescue the hostages . They were surprisingly ill-prepared , deploying untrained teams , lack of proper equipment , and had to recall countless of attempts , before the final embarrassment at the airport , which exposed their severe weakness at handling terrorist incidents . All the hostages were killed in the confrontation , when the terrorists threw hand grenades and emptied bullets into the helicopters they were in . It's only after this that the Germans formed their anti-terror squad , the GSG9 ( Counter-strike players will be familiar with this term ) . To make matters worse , there was a cover up and collusion between the Germans and the terrorists when the latter apparently hijacked a Lufthansa flight ( with only 12 passengers on board , and no women and children ) , and the former handed over the 3 surviving terrorists of the Munich incident in exchange for safe passage of the flight . Which is where Spielberg's movie comes in , following squads of Mossad agents hunting down and assassinating those 3 ( 1 managed to survive countless attempts on his life ) , together with others who are implicated or involved in the planning of the Munich operation . This documentary provides an excellent and compelling background , preparing you for the Munich movie coming soon . Watch this . Code 1 DVD features a relatively barebones version , containing the usual scene selections , subtitles and bonus trailers . But the documentary itself is worth it .
514609	317399	388795	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Brokeback Mountain	Here's my challenge : Watch Casanova and Jarhead ( both now showing in local theaters ) before watching Brokeback Mountain , to appreciate and to keep fresh in your mind , the acting range of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal . One plays a king of lovemaking , while the other plays an army grunt , in which both are alpha-males roles . Then when you watch Brokeback Mountain , you'll probably be wide-eyed at how these two have a go at each other . Based upon the 1997 short story by Edna Anne Proulx , you must have your head stuck in mud if you're not aware this movie is about two cowboy shepherds who share a relationship up in the mountains of Brokeback . Set in 1963 , we see Ennis Del Mar ( Ledger ) and Jack Twist ( Gyllenhaal ) team up in their job to shepherd sheep to graze , and having strict orders to be separate most times to take care of their flock . But being together alone in the mountains , sharing their lives with each other , brings them too close , and soon , they share a forbidden illicit relationship ( hey , they're supposed to be macho cowboys , and it's the 60s of free love and Vietnam looming ) that transcends the usual boundaries of male bonding . It's like a summer love , and after an hour into the film , we explore how this love affect them as they try to ease themselves back to normalcy . Except that things are never going to be normal anymore . While they establish families - Del Mar with his be-throed Alma ( Michelle Williams ) , and Twist with rich Lureen Newsome ( Anne Hathaway in another role which she shows off her assets ) , they cannot forget their throes of passion they had sparked back in summer of 63 . Before long , they get together again to reignite their passion for each other and continue over a period of 20 years . One thing's for sure , the story will still play out decently if you substitute gay love with heterosexual roles , like the countless of movies on cheating spouses , but there'll be a very distinct lack of punch . You'll notice that the male couples share similar trials and tribulations of any relationship - the love , passion , how much one party is willing to give the other , and how much the other will reciprocate , and unfulfilled dreams . What gives this movie the edge is how the characters are compelled to look for each other for solace , and the deceit and lies they have to go through in order to be together . It's a movie that's paced slowly , but gives opportunity for the audience to admire the postcard perfect ( CGI-enhanced ) landscape of the mountains and plains , to study the expressions of the characters , to listen and ponder upon the dialog . Lee Ang had made Chinese Wu-Xia movies sexy , and it's no wonder that he has also managed to add a touch of sensuality that permeates throughout Brokeback . The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack helps too in keeping the mood and emotions in check , serving to add to the narrative in periods of silenced dialog . Perhaps something which I thought was pretty neat , was the idea brought forward from Kinsey , that there is a degree of homosexuality in all of us , and it depends on how gay you are , or have the courage , to come out of the closet . What's interesting is when you think about whether the notion of gayness stems from nature , or nurture . If you'd seen the movie , you'll know what I'm talking about , and how passion can consume someone , that it takes over all sensibility , and about the propensity of risk you're willing to take . Heath Ledger had a pretty busy 2005 , with diverse roles in Brothers Grimm , Lords of Dogtown , Casanova and this . I've seen all of them , and while I disliked Grimm , I thought his roles in 2005 should be credited with an Oscar win for this . Jake Gyllenhaal too plays Twist with a touch of machoness , and yet is able to slip back into needy whining gentleness with a flick of a switch . Michelle Williams ' role , while small , is accentuated by the particular one scene in which she discover the truth . It is powerful - nothing much said , but everything said through the eyes . Perhaps the weakness link is Hathaway with her megawatt smile and bimbotic blonde looks , as the clueless wife of Twist caught in between some major family squabbles . Homophobes will probably give this movie a miss , but to generally brand this as a gay movie will be missing the point . I'd recommend it to everyone I know to watch this with an open mind . It's an out-and-out dramatic story on relationships , and it's classic storytelling at its best , with excellent acting and strong direction , cinematography , heck , this movie deserves its 8 Academy nominations , so let's see it take home some honors ( I'm not sticking my neck out just yet , until I watch all the other contenders ) . P . S . Yes , this movie is shown here uncut . If you're not celebrating this movie , at least celebrate the fact that we can get to watch it here as it is intended to be .
515177	317399	768114	9.0	A Nutshell Review : After This Our Exile	This film needs no introduction . The latest work from director-writer Patrick Tam , After This Our Exile took home honours from the recent 2006 Golden Horse Awards for Best Actor , Best Supporting Actor , and Best PIcture , and after watching it today , it's no surprise why it did . As mentioned in one of my recent reviews , the storyline of a movie is important , nevermind if the technicalities are great , because if the story doesn't engage , then it's a battle lost , in my opinion anyway . In After This Our Exile , the story is extremely simple , but it resonates deeply , and also because it deals with something very personal , very close , and perhaps , family ties always cut closer to home . After all , the Chinese title is Fu Zi , literally translated as Father-Son , which is quite unsophisticated if compared to the English title . If you raised an eyebrow in Aaron Kwok's win for his acting in Divergence and thought he probably didn't deserve it , then his role as Sheng will win you over and justify his back to back win at the Golden Horse Awards . I'm sold . Gone are those teeny-bopper bad hair days and repetitive dance moves . Now , with maturity , he adds a certain gravitas to his roles , and kudos too to his willingness to take on unsavoury characters , instead of playing hero all the time . His dad is the perennial terror , one who blows hot and cold in a whim , full of false bravado , and never hesitant to raise a hand against spouse and kid . Uneducated , loud , uncouth , and worse , a habitual gambler , life for his family is difficult , both in material and emotional wealth . Yes , Kwok pulled off this character with aplomb , with subtle nuances , gestures , mannerisms and attitude all spot on , bringing to life a character you'll so love to hate , yet sympathize with at the same time . And since the " Fu " played opposite the " Zi " , and having both of actors pull off their father son relationship so convincingly , with great on screen chemistry , it's no wonder too that 9 year old Gouw Ian Iskandar took home the Best Supporting Actor award as the Son . His childlike innocence will probably bowl you over with earnestness , as he holds his own opposite Kwok and screen mother played by Charlie Young . He doesn't come off as irritating , and is so much likable and vulnerable in character that you just want to give him a hug . Intuitive and smart , you'd come to love and pity his character very early in the story . Charlie Young only had half as much to do as the other two leads , and without makeup , she manages to bring out that average every day weary look of a tired mother and wife who had enough . And herein , the conflict begins , from the beginning of the film . Other supporting cast include Valen Hsu and Kelly Lin , are kept to a minimum , thereby keeping the focus squarely on the principal cast . As I mentioned earlier , After This Our Exile tells a simple tale with deep themes , and is able to draw out emotions from within you as it resonates . In what could be problems that households face when there's a gambler in the home , the movie sets to show these issues from the onset , with the breaking down of family ties and values , and the debt causing financial strain on the family . I guess opposition to our Integrated Resorts would see their arguments fleshed out here . In what could be an oversimplification of the issue , gamblers = debts = strain in family relations , it is this domestic disturbance that ring out vividly . Broadly it can be categorized into two acts ( no , I won't say anything more ) , but each act focuses on different aspects on the family relationship and dynamics . Toward the end , everything comes full circle , with the son experiencing exactly what the mom has gone through , and it makes the movie extremely poignant . It emphasizes the widely held notion that in domestic squabbles , it's always the children who suffer the fate of the consequences . Brilliant cinematography and awesome musical pieces complemented the movie well , with plenty of nice piano pieces punctuating emotional moments . The pacing , though slow , is well measured , and Ipoh never looked more beautiful , becoming a character in itself rather than just another locale to shoot the film in . Attention to details are not spared , and the production brings about Malaysian flavour to it too . Some though I predict , may not enjoy the open end that director Patrick Tam chose to finish it with , but it will allow for post viewing discussion , loads of it . My only gripe , as I just found out , is that the theatrical version now showing in theatres , is the watered down one . The director's cut , clocking in at almost 2 . 5 hours , get whittled down to 2 hours here , leaving certain scenes on the cutting room floor which were glimpsed at through a series of very quick flashback montage . I thought the film could have gone on and showed us more footage , especially on the father-son bonding ( hinted from production stills ) , which I thought would have added a better level of the understanding about the dynamics of the Fu-Zi relationship . The second movie this year which used the You Are My Sunshine song ( the other is the Korean movie ) , After This Our Exile makes its way easily into my shortlist of favourite movies of 2006 . You are my sunshine , making me happy when skies are grey . You never know how much I love you .
515577	317399	401997	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Breach	Breach is directed by Billy Ray , who also wrote Flightplan and directed his only other movie , Shattered Glass , also based on real events . Based on the true story of the greatest security breach in US History , it traces the events leading to the arrest of decorated and respected FBI agent Robert Hanssen , who is one heck of a mole within the organization , committing treason of the highest order by betraying the country and selling secrets to the Soviet Union . FBI newbie Eric O'Neill ( Ryan Philippe ) gets assigned as an undercover within his own organization , in order to bring down what could possibly be the most difficult inside man to nab , because of his numerous years of field experience , and expertise . Robert Hanssen ( Chris Cooper ) on the surface appears to be stoic , no nonsense , and a God fearing man , but underneath the facade lies something more sinister , and Eric is assigned to obtain proof and evidence in order to charge Hanssen , rather than based on the evidence already gathered which would only garner him a few years imprisonment . It's spy versus spy , mole infiltration and family misunderstandings revisited again , as Eric has to deal with convincing his boss Hanssen that he is trustworthy , and to maintain that trustworthiness with his wife , who has absolutely no idea how sensitive her husband's involvement in the investigations is , and therefore a sore point conflicting with his mission . For those into spy thrillers , you'll need some patience as the movie takes its time to set up the kill . However , it's a pleasure just watching it develop every step of the way , despite knowing its outcome , and that there is no big bang exaggerated set action piece . It's an intellectual mindfield for Eric to tread , on one hand feeling extremely beholden and admiring Hanssen , yet on the other , having to snoop everything and report back to his bosses , for that hazy " for the good of everyone " mission objective . Chris Cooper gave a superb performance as the charismatic Robert Hanssen , while fielding deep dark undertones within his character . I liked the front bit where he mentors his " clerk " Eric , with full ego and cockiness of a veteran , explaining the bit about turf protection , office politics within the Bureau and inter-agency rivalry . Ryan Philippe managed to hold his own against Cooper , and was believable as the man tasked to bring down a veteran - you can feel his adrenaline rush when assigned the mission , yet sympathize with his apprehensions each step of the way . Laura Linney unfortunately played only a bit role as the direct supervisor for Eric's mission , and provided at times some light hearted moments as she exasperates over Eric's many decisions and pointed questions . There's a degree of added authenticity with the real Eric O'Neill serving as special consultant to the movie . So if spy thrillers are your cup of tea , then Breach will definitely not disappoint . Make time for this !
514459	317399	257360	9.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) About Schmidt	Retirement can be a scary thing . I suppose it's about 40 years before I hit retirement age ( given that it's a moving target on the increase ) , but I do confess at times I think about it , a time where I presumably have the opportunity to do whatever I please - travel , read , and of course watch more movies at discounted ticket prices , and so on , but whether or not I will have the strength and energy to do so will be a different story , and more importantly , whether my retirement funds will be sufficient to support a lifestyle I choose . Anyway I was surprised with About Schmidt . At first glance I thought it was going to be a mundane movie , but it had plenty of heart , and many moments of contemplation which actually made me ponder deeper about those sunset times . Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt , a Vice President of an insurance company who retires at the start of the story . Naturally it takes much getting used to , and with time on his hands , he thinks about the legacy , or the lack thereof , in which he is leaving behind . From not being appreciated by the younger generation taking over his office , to trying to patch ties with his estranged daughter Jeannie ( Hope Davis ) who's about to get married to a blue collared " loser " Randall ( Dermot Mulroney , note that I put that word in quotations , because I thought I'd become fast friends with people like that , those who are genuinely earnest ) , much against his wishes , here's a portrait of an extremely sad , lonely man trying to take stock of his life , where little routine things suddenly become significant . The first half of the movie set the scene , before the second half takes us on a road trip of sorts , much like Broken Flowers or even Elizabethtown , during which Schmidt exhibits more of his insecurities and fear . Jack Nicholson did a superb job as usual fleshing out the character of Warren , with the cinematography being tip top in bringing out the detachment he experiences with his environment . You can feel his pain and wanting to belong , holding dear to treasures of his heart , especially his daughter . And to borrow these lines from his earlier movie , Jack's Warren Schmidt personifies " I'm only laughing on the outside , my smile is just skin deep . but if you look inside I'm really crying , you might join me for a weep ! " to a T . Based on a novel by Louis Begley and directed by Alexander Payne ( who brought us another road trip movie Sideways ) , one of the highlights of the movie is Warren's communication with an African child he adopted long distance . Through his letters , it becomes clear the issues he's grappling with , and some of the white lies he tells , which mirrors the way he lives his life . And I must say as much as movie endings are important , About Schmidt has one of the simplest , but most powerful message it brings out , and that is while we worry about the legacy we live behind in the world for generations to come , sometimes it's not necessary that it must be something monumental . The simplest gesture , straight from the heart , is all there is to make a difference , and stamp your mark . With an excellent waltz like theme for Warren Schmidt , and that shot of Encyclopedia Brown ( nostalgia ! I read that as a kid ! ) , I'd recommend About Schmidt anytime should anyone ask which recent Jack Nicolson movies one should watch . Be warned though , the Code 3 DVD is censored , especially those bits with Kathy Bates ( I suspect for , erm , nudity ) .
514753	317399	886539	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Luck By Chance	The opening sequence montage is beautifully designed , paying a quiet and dignified homage to the upline and downchain support functions of the entire film industry , like the guards protecting film studios and film sets , and cashiers at the box office , with the song Yeh Zindagi Bhi as a backdrop . But this serene and muted beginning is in stark contrast to everything else that is going to unfold , where humour is largely used to great effect in cushioning the unflattering commentary on the state of affairs . For example , much has been said about story lines and sets resembling some big budgeted Hollywood counterpart , and you have a director blatantly telling his scriptwriter to adopt everything from his favourite movie . A lot of satire get tossed around , and rewards the viewer paying close attention . There's even an avenue for sight gags , and one of my favourites is the poster entitled " For a Few Rupees More " . The strength of Luck By Chance is in its strong story , characterization and dialogue . It plays on everyone's stereotypes , but yet doesn't turn its main characters to caricatures . It shows the distinct worlds that aspiring wannabe actors have to face , versus those born with luck on their side , being the offspring of famous and established stars in the movie world . It examines the struggles of the dream chasers coming to Mumbai looking for their big break , where it is established that lead roles only go to newcomers when they are soundly rejected by the stars , and the insecurities and threats that established stars constantly face , with the dealing of pressure and success , and maintaining that public icon . For the bevy of star childs as they are known ( in my short foray into Indian films I have seen a number of up and coming ones ) , the mounting expectations that one has to deal from the public . Luck By Chance has a movie within the movie which the subplots are laid out against , and like all productions , funding is always key , as is the network that one has to find a foothold in because of the tacit understanding that it's about who you know and who you're related to , versus pure talent . Hence the title , where one has to be at the right place at the right time staring at the right opportunity in order to get noticed amongst thousands . Vikram Jaisingh ( the director's brother Farhan Akhtar ) is one such aspiring actor who moved from Delhi to Mumbai in search of stardom , and lives with 2 other friends and their neighbour Sona ( Konkona Sen Sharma ) who is the mistress of small time producer Chaudhary ( Alyy Khan ) of Pinky Productions , waiting for her big break to star in a big budgeted movie with a tailor made role . At the other end of the spectrum , we have the insecure mega-star Zaffar Khan ( Hrithik Roshan , whom I think is like a chameleon in being able to shape his physique at the drop of a hat ) starring in his new movie with star child Nikki Wallia ( Isha Sharvani ) , the offspring of screen legend Neena ( Dimple Kapadia ) . And adding plenty of colour to the events in and around this movie production , are the producer Romy Rolly ( Rishi Kapoor ) and his brother , the actor turned director Ranjit Rolly ( Sanjay Kapoor ) who share the spoils for most of the comedy . There are plenty of insider jokes spilt at every corner , making fun of commercial and art films , gossip rags and the sensationalizing of news . Upping the fun factor are a slew of cameo appearances with real stars playing themselves , and you can imagine the gasps when Aamir Khan appeared briefly in the beginning , and another Khan ( I'm not revealing who amongst the three Kings , your guess ) popping out to whistles from the audience for his simple role offering advice about dealing with stardom and what really matters . And to add to that if I may name drop a little , Abhishek Bachchan , John Abraham , Kareena Kapoor , Rani Mukherjee , amongst many others . We follow the making of the fictional movie from start to end , and even then , there is but only two prominent musical numbers which arise from that fictional movie alone , one of which we get to see Hrithik Roshan showcase his slick moves in a big top number . The second half of the film might have sagged a little as more attention was placed to the three way romance between Vikram , Nikki ( check out that seduction scene that seems to have taken a leaf out of Russian Dolls ) and Sona , and how success can get into one's head and the transformation from humbleness to jerk . Farhan Akhtar gives an excellent performance as the boy who innocently , then manipulative worked the system to his selfish advantage toward climbing the ladder of success , and the way it ended strongly in quite an unconventional way for a Bollywood movie , gives this film a certain gravitas in being unflinching in the messages it wants to make about the industry , where the tenacious succeed and there is not much room for sentimentalism . If you're looking for a jump point into what's on offer from Bollywood this year , then I would humbly suggest that Luck By Chance would be your best bet for an introduction to the wheelings , dealings and politicking behind the scenes by all players involved in getting the production complete , right down to generating buzz upon release , and how with luck , one's chances in life could be changed and transformed . Highly recommended .
515011	317399	408306	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Munich	The Munich 1972 Olympic games will forever go down in infamy for the killing of Israeli sportsmen by a terrorist group known as Black September . If you wish to know more about the motives and happenings on that fateful day , including the ineptness of the Germans to manage the entire situation , resulting in the deaths of almost all the perpetrator and the victims , do check out the documentary One Day In September . But not to say that Steven Spielberg's Munich fares any less . My recommendation is to watch the documentary first if you wish to understand more of what happened before , then to follow up with Spielberg's movie for the tale of what happened after when the Mossad went after the mastermind planners . So that you'll not be as irritating as the bimbo sitting behind me asking her equally clueless boyfriend " what happened ? Why like that ? " Spielberg's movie is as every bit , Spielberg . It grips you from the beginning and never lets go until the end . For those who did not heed my advice above , don't worry , there's a re-enactment of the terrible event from the point where they entered into the Olympic Village , and various scenes thereafter en route to the airport are edited in between the movie . As mentioned , the movie places focus on the Mossad's attempt to wipe out the terrorist masterminds , and we follow the journey of their appointed leader , Avner , played admirably by Eric Bana , who now probably has cornered roles for the tough yet sensitive guy , like Hector in Troy , or Bruce Banner in Hulk . And it's this spy-versus-spy game , that this movie excels in . We take the usual peek into government organizations sponsoring clandestine operations , and assembles Avner with a team that looked straight out of Mission : Impossible's IMF . We follow them through the missions so carefully planned ala Ocean's Eleven , aimed at sending signals to the Israeli oppositions that force will be met with force , and violence with violence . Indeed violence begets violence , and what goes around comes around , but at what cost ? Information brokers are all set to profit from violence , and in the world of secret agents , so long as the price is right , you get your information , regardless of what you want to do with it . But the movie also takes a more personal look into the life of Avner , who started off with gusto and with a deep sense of patriotism in their missions , before we slowly see the toil being taken on a family man who can't be with his family , or his home and country , and the degeneration of Avner into paranoia . When you're playing hunter for so long , and you find yourself one day being the prey , that's the effect it'll have on you , of over suspicion on the pretext of playing it safe . John Williams is at his element here in providing a soundtrack that is intense and fits the movie perfectly . During mission scenes , you'll feel just as tense as the characters planning and executing ( pardon the pun ) their hits . Avner's team comprises of folks who are not exactly field experts , but their camaraderie on screen is at its finest . I was paying attention to Daniel Craig's highly volatile character Steve , and I'd still think he doesn't have what it takes to become Blond , I mean , Bond . And besides Craig , the only other peculiarly minor letdown I have was the final bed scene between Avner and wife . I thought the editing was done in a very distasteful manner , though I understand what it was trying to get at with the inter-splicing of the Munich massacre . Somehow it could have been done better . It's a controversial film , but only for the controversy surrounding the subject matter , and of Spielberg's roots . It doesn't glorify either side , or try to make a statement which side is right . Two wrongs never made a right , and the movie's narrative plays it that way . On a normal year , this film would be a strong contender for Best Picture , given all the predictable ingredients required for a win . However , Brokeback Mountain would probably snag the trophy for its more intimate feel as compared to standard fare of a crowd pleasing film . But the message in Munich is nonetheless clear , as hinted so subtly at a small scene of tuning a radio .
515231	317399	389860	9.0	A Nutshell Review : Click	With comedies , I half expected the best bits to make it to the trailers . They always do these days , and leave the actual movie much to be desired in the laughs department . Click however , was a totally different ball game altogether , not that it was lacking in laughs , but never did I expect the 2nd half of the movie to go where it went . It might be formulaic , but the message it has for the audience , rings through so effectively through Adam Sandler's performance . Sandler plays Michael Newman , an extremely busy architect trying to find his way to the next big promotion , to be the business partner of his company alongside his boss Ammer ( hammed up by David Hasselhoff ) . To Michael , he is working his butt off in order to provide for his family , and places work priority always as number 1 , at the expense of family and quality time . He's uber mean , and vents his frustrations at the neighbour's kid ( not that he's any way likable to begin with ) . In an effort to get a remote control to universally control all the electrical appliances at home , he chances upon a quirky salesman Morty ( Christopher Walken ) who gives him for free , one such device . Not before long , Michael learns of the power of the " universal remote " , and his entire life becomes a DVD menu - where he can playback , fast forward , and even watch certain milestones in his life with a James Earl Jones ' voiced commentary . And it is here that the movie constantly churned out comedic situations after comedic situations , with all kinds of humour flying around at every turn . But in the second half , the movie takes on dramatic proportions as in Sandler's earlier movie Spanglish , which I also enjoyed . Beneath the laughter , comes a serious reminder about our priorities , and it made me think , hard . Sure we all strive to excel at what we do , in order to eke out a living . It's always easier said than done , but it served as a good reminder , to those with families and kids , not to neglect them . The importance of putting family first , and achieving some form of work-life balance , sometimes get overlooked as we run the rat race . Time never looks back , and once you miss the boat , that's it , and there's no practical way to rewind to key moments in life , like a movie can . In living life , there are always bounds and bounds of challenges . After all , aren't those challenges supposed to make life interesting ? Instead of sidestepping issues and sweeping them under the carpet , we must learn to face them with gusto instead of looking for the easy way out . At times , choosing the easy way out will mean the missing out on the experience , which to me is a whole lot more costly . But no worries , perhaps I'm just looking too deeply into the message in the movie , but you get my drift . And the cast is picture perfect , with Michael's parents ( Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner - she voices Marge Simpson ) providing an extended family feel to Michael's wife ( the beautiful Kate Beckinsale ) and two kids ( Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann ) . Sean Astin has a bit role here as a swimming coach , and there are plenty of " vase " babes in this movie , like Sophie Monk ( Date Movie ) Fans of The Cranberries will also be pleased when a beautiful ballad from the band is played , and Dolores O'Riordan actually made an appearance too performing Linger . And by the time that happens , some in the audience would already be standing by , or using tissues already . Click managed to keep its entire second , more serious act under wraps in the trailers , but when revealed in the movie , provided a more layered , adult theme in this comedy which makes one wonder , have you told your family you love them today ?
514734	317399	444778	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Citizen Dog	Oh my , I love this movie so much , and I'm wondering where should my gushing start from . Director Wisit Sasanatieng has weaved yet another beautiful film in terms of visuals in this romance-fantasy story , and it's not difficult to see the progression and retention of the plus points made from his earlier feature Tears of the Black Tiger . Perhaps first the storyline . It's quirky and bizarre , fit for a fairy tale like structure in terms of narrative style . Yet at the same time it's uplifting , inspirational and provides plenty of hope . Key to the plot is the aged old saying that when you're always looking for something , you'll never find it , but once you stopped searching , it'll appear right in front of you . This will be the central theme throughout the movie , at times made up of seemingly separate segments touching on the different lives that our hero Pod ( Mahasamut Boonyaruk ) encounters . Many of the bizarreness of the city are seen through the innocent eyes of Pod , a country bumpkin who left his country home to journey to Bangkok in search for a better life . And it's a pretty pastel coloured world , adding a surreal sense to all the happenings in Pod's life , throughout his work as a packer in a sardine factory , a security guard , and a taxi driver . In a number of decisions that he makes , he does it for his love , Jin ( Saengthong Gate - Uthong ) , who works as a maid in the same company . Jin , an obsessive compulsive with cleanliness , however , is the pragmatist , and doesn't think that their current financial status would allow them to lead a comfortable life together . Hence it's a constant pursuit for Pod , as Jin gets very sidetracked with her aims in life - as an environmental activist as well as to find out the true meaning of her mysterious white book . Narrated by fellow Thai filmmaker Pen-Ek Ratanaruang , the opening credits played to an addictive song , signals that it's one heck of a ride . There are plenty of endearing , funny , and kooky characters that populate the city . from a young girl who smokes and swears , a licker , a taxi-motorcyclist , and even Pod's Grandmother all make this dream-like Bangkok , something worth highlighting . There are loads of wonderful songs included to help move the narrative along , since dialogue by the leads , especially in the beginning , is kept to a minimum . There are plenty of special effects and techniques used to complement the beautiful , colourful cinematography , and even animation and stop motion puppetry were used to bring some characters to life . The art direction too is top notch , and the sets are always a sight to behold . The jokes come fast and furious , and mostly through the playing out of the innocence and dreams of Pod , literal as well as figural , as he tries to make sense of this new world he lives in . This is a highly recommended movie , and I think I'll try to look for its DVD . Wisit Sasanatieng is currently at the helm of a ( locally funded ? ) production called Armful , and going by his track record , I sure would be interested to see his spin on a martial arts movie .
515101	317399	118694	10.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) In the Mood for Love ( 2000 )	It's beautifully depressing . How someone you come to love , in a relationship that's forbidden and socially frowned upon from the onset , has decidedly moved on , while you cling onto and yet distract yourself from it , until the day you finally choose to call it quits , by trying hard to forget the bittersweet memories . That basically summed up the storyline in Wong Kar-wai's movie , with the title from a song of the same name , it's all about the mood . And key to bringing this mood to life , is the excellent production sets , art direction and costumes . Accurate to the littlest detail of how a 60s Shanghainese community in Hong Kong lived , I couldn't help but smile at the presence of an " amah " , because I grew up as a toddler with one , kind of . And the language adds that bit of authenticity too . This movie did wonders for the cheong-sam , having Maggie Cheung appearing in different ones in most scenes to highlight time progression . And what is mood without the necessary music to punctuate the visually beautiful shots , by long time cinematographer and collaborator Christopher Doyle , and Lee Pin Bing ? It's half the battle won in my opinion , that the musical pieces fill the gaps which lack dialogue and compliments the slow cinematic shots , and I'm addicted to the waltz of the main love theme . But it's one thing to have excellent music , and another when the music , effects and ambient noise are able to carry the entire movie on its own ( you can select this audio track option from the Criterion Collection DVD ) . Now that the obvious statements about music , sets , costumes are out of the way , all these come to naught without a story . I'm glad that most of the scenes which were cut off , were done so , as they were quite cheesy , though humorous , and what remained from the 15 months production , tells a very mature , measured story on forbidden love in society's eyes , friendship and then more . There are plenty of material here which 2046 , another movie which I enjoyed , had referenced , adapted and complimented , such as the hotel room , the writer in Chow Mo-wan ( Tony Leung ) , and his attitude in the sequel . One of my earlier Wong Kar-wai movies which I watched as a teen in the cinemas is Days of Being WIld , starring an ensemble cast which included Maggie Cheung , here as Mrs Chan , though I'd like to think of her movie's character here , as an extension of Su Li-zhen in Days ( actually Wong provided her that character as a reference point when Maggie was asking incessantly questions about her character ) . And Tony's character in Days , a last moment cameo like appearance supposedly about a gambler in a never-made sequel , I'd liken it to Chow here , so in my own way , these movies form a loose trilogy . For those who have already watched the Korean movie April Snow , you would already realize that it borrows from the same theme of two characters , chancing upon each other by Fate , and learning that their respective spouses were having an affair with each other . While April Snow went for the common jugular in having the cheated upon spouses go head on with each other , In the Mood tackles it way too differently , providing loads of tension , and subtle teases , negating your want of the leads to develop their friendship into something more . And therein lies the strength of the movie . How Chow and Mrs Chan develop an unlikely friendship , which hints strongly at how it all could have been , under a 60s conservative environment , where they have to restrain their feelings for each other under society's judging eyes . Living in a communal environment too doesn't help their cause , even though it is pure to begin with - 2 lonely people , betrayed , and at times , tempted to take that leap of faith to challenge societal norms about love . Thankfully , potentially confusing ideas were not fully developed or made the final cut . There were thoughts to have the respective cheating spouses played by the same actors , but that would truly add to the confusion , The idea was developed separately into the " what could have been " and played out as various " rehearsals " as Chow and Mrs Chan try in their earlier quest to find out the whys and the hows their spouses could have gotten together , known each other , and started off the affair , but themselves vowing that they will never go down the same path . So in this vow already laid the foundations of how their friendship would be , and set a line in which their friendship could not cross nor develop into something more . And it's sometimes ironic too , that Mrs Chan , in her job , assists her boss in covering up his affairs . Kinda like a what-goes-around-comes-around . There are plenty of imagery throughout the movie that one could look into and try and interpret . I'd take forever in trying to list down all of mine , perhaps I'll do so one day when I own the DVD ( saving to get my copy ! ) , but I particularly liked the one at the restaurant where they finally learnt about their spouse's affair , and that long walk back home , where they walk , from out of step , into tandem . It's a becoming of 2 to 1 , where lonely persons find solace in each other's company , especially in the scenes after . Anyway , all said , I love the movie , and it ranks up there with my all time favourites . If you were to watch it , make it none other than the Criterion Collection . ( I'm not advertising for them , but I feel that this edition would help the viewer to appreciate the many rich layers more ) .
515437	317399	991183	10.0	A Nutshell Review : How to Become Myself	Based on a story by Kaori Mado , How to Become Myself touches base with what it means to understand oneself , and being very comfortable with it . To be honest , everyone plays different roles in different situations with different people encountered . I can be a brother , friend , soldier , employee , reviewer , son , and the list goes on , putting on different masks , being different persons , adopting various personae . With the advent of the Internet and anonymous profiles , what you can be , is limited only by your imagination . ( And of course you've got perverts being totally something else altogether ) . And in the many roles we play , how often do we stop and take stock - just who the heck am I ? Who's the real me , and what's the " me " that I'm portraying for others to see and interact with ? Bottomline is , are you being true to yourself and being honest about yourself with others ? Or are you superficially role playing with nary an emotional attachment to the part ? What I thought was neat was that the movie doesn't shove this thought down your throat , but rather played it out through the interaction between the leads . Subtlety is by far Ichikawa's strongest point in his movies ( based on the 4 I've seen ) , and his pace of the movies allows you room enough to ponder as scenes transition and the narrative develops on screen . Juri ( Niko Narumi , you'll be amazed that she's only so young , but yet has the capability to take on a character that so layered and yet so subtle in her delivery ) plays an ideal girl at home and in school , but this facade is quickly stripped away early in the movie , as we see her loathe her parent's bickering at home , while putting up a false front of a happy , supportive family to the outside world . In the movie , the spotlight is also shared by fellow classmate Hinako ( Atsuko Maeda ) , a popular girl who in a twist of fate , becomes the victim of classroom politics and bullying . Mere acquaintances , they share a poignant conversation just after junior school graduation , before going their separate ways . The story then fast forwards 2 years later , and Juri , out of curiosity , looks up and emails Hanako , who apparently doesn't seem to remember her , or their conversation . And thus begins a reintroduction and attempts to build a friendship between the two in what is probably one of the most layered stories I've experienced in recent times . It's almost like kueh-lapis , where each layer can be peeled apart and reveals another understanding at a different level . It tells of the story in three ways , through exchanges of email ( more on this later ) , as the catalyst and fuel for creative writing , and of course , in the character's real lives . Juri and Hinako wear different masks to play different roles , consciously and subconsciously , and with each being a projection of their articifically created self , there's no denying just who's playing what role , and questions of whether they're relishing these roles are posed , and when do you know to stop and become yourself , truly ? Watching the narrative unfold was part of the fun , as techniques such as panel in panel , and split screens , are used to simultaneously present to the audience the different character's action / reaction at the same point in time . Not to mention that the shots are beautifully rendered , with text messages from mobile phones bringing to mind Eric Khoo's Be With Me . In true Ichikawa style , the pacing is deliberately slow , and the wonderful soundtrack comprises of eclectic pop tunes as well as quiet contempla tive pieces , all of which I thought complimented the movie very well . But what I really enjoyed when watching the movie , and how it connected with me , was the way it seemed like a dispenser of tips on love and the living of life . And this brings to mind the song Everybody's Free ( To Wear Sunscreen ) , which itself was based on an article written in the Chicago Tribune on 1st June 1997 by Mary Schmich titled " Advice , like youth , probably wasted on the young " . I got the same feeling when reading the column ( and re-reading it again ) back in those days , listening to the song version of it , and now watching a series of events unfold on screen as one character projects her self onto another , as well as the aptly included commencement sequence . Sometimes things just click , and connects on a different level which appealed to me at least . And now about that email exchange , I think it's prudent to bear in mind that the Japanese wireless telecommunications network is different from the GSM one that we're so used to . I've heard some puzzled expressions and comments about how it's possible to not know who is calling based on the Caller-ID , but I suppose that the Japanese network is already more highly advanced and developed than the GSM one , and sending an email through a phone is a piece of cake . So let's not confuse that with the sending of SMS , which obviously then this story , or how it panned out , wouldn't apply to places like ours . And yeah , I like their phones too , even though it's the girly model - there's something about the simplicity and minimalist look and feel about it ( in the design , not features ) that I'm impressed with . How to Become Myself easily ranks amongst my favourite of Ichikawa Jun's movies to date , in addition to Tokyo Marigold . Highly recommended as it's a really good film all round !
514623	317399	468492	10.0	A Nutshell Review : The Host	This movie has already been much hyped because everyone is wondering what the Koreans saw in it to make it a resounding box office smash . So does it live up to expectations ? Yes , in a different way . What I'll include below will be suitable more for a post viewing read , although most will probably have some prior knowledge about the movie from its trailers and poster . If you don't mind mild spoilers , you can proceed , until the part where I'll warn you about something major . Watching this film will make you laugh at its comedic moments , feel a tinge of sadness in others and it might make you cry , or pound your heart with suspense , and will even satisfy the action movie lovers with some sequences . It's like a big pot of rojak - different ingredients mashed together , blended perfectly into a 2 hour long journey of pure entertainment with serious messages . At the heart of it is a tale about family . Here , given its genre , there's no all-empowered super being or man's man who goes on a one man crusade against the beast . It's about what an ordinary family doing the extraordinary by digging deep and finding strength from within . The portrayal by the lead actors are quite believable , as you feel their pain , frustrations and idiosyncrasies as they go about trying to achieve their mission despite the odds . One thing's for sure , family ties run deep , with emphasis on unity , not individuality . There're some key observations made about the human condition , how naturally curious we are when we spot things not normally seen , instinctively whipping out cameras to take pictures , and how we innocently provoke without realizing . Not too subtle jibes are made at how bumbling authorities are , and on the pompousness of the US forces in assuming control over the situation , sidestepping what they probably know as the real cause with a presentation of a smokescreen . Here's where the major spoilers beginThe monster ! ! I absolutely have to blabber about it ! I was half expecting Godzilla pounding through the streets of Seoul and pulverizing buildings to a pulp . But wait ! The Host came up with something pretty refreshing - this monster , is midget ! ( if compared to conventional notions of what a monster would be ) . Herein lies one of the breakdowns in genre , but tenacity and nastiness is not measured on size alone - it's menacing and merciless when the time calls for it . The creation of the monster came from a fictionalized imagining of a real life scenario gone wrong , with regards to the lack of respect to the environment , and on toxic pollution . If Godzilla was created in the nuclear age to highlight its dangers , then this being was created because of mankind's preference for the easy way out - through the kitchen sink . The bugger looked beautifully ugly , but thanks to its excellent special effects teams ( one of which is WETA , yeah , THAT WETA ) , it moves with slick grace and agility , I would even say it swaggers stylishly , It is so realistic , that never for a moment you'll think you're watching a cheesy monster flick ( even though rubber suits are nostalgic ) . Major spoilers end The music is yet another plus point as it brought out the mood and plays with your emotions as well . The sound department has its work cut out in designing a unique roar , and you'll feel terrorized as if you're there on location as the creature rampages . For good measure , you might want to stay until the end of the credits for a little easter egg , and especially if you're watching it in a hall outfitted with a decent surround sound system . All in all , two words : Highly recommended . Goes into my shortlist of movie of the year too ! P . S . I don't know why , but I was swearing at some parts of the movie ( eg . " RUN ! ! " ) together with another group of strangers . We were having a hellishly good , fun time during the screening . Awesome !
515009	317399	433692	10.0	A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Sepet ( 2004 )	I've always been unable to answer confidently when someone asks me what my favourite movie is . You're learning it here first , I've found it . It is Sepet . I love this movie to bits . And I find it so unforgivable to have missed it when it was released on the big screen locally . But the question would be , why Sepet ? You'd know by now I'm a sucker for a good old fashioned romance . Sepet is one of those classic romances , with a contemporary touch , and a realistic take on love , life , relationships at all levels . It is honest , sincere storytelling , and having it ring so close to home , with a multi-religious , multi-cultural , multi-lingual take , just makes it endearing . It's not a Malay film , or Chinese film , but it's a Malaysian film , one in which a person like me , from across the Causeway , can and will definitely enjoy . Director Yasmin Ahmad has crafted two charismatic leads , in Jason ( Ng Choo Seong ) , the pirated VCD peddler with a penchant for poetry , and Orked ( Sharifah Amani ) the student . One's Chinese , the other's Malay , and Yasmin has weaved a loving story between the two , sans all misconstrued prejudices . We're drawn into their love at the start of their budding relationship from their chance encounter when Orked patronizes Jason's stall in a busy market street , and witness them grow in their affection for each other . The diverse family backgrounds are highlighted from the beginning . We see Jason reciting poetry so lovingly to his Peranakan mother ( played by Tan Mei Ling ) . He seemed closer to her than his father , and we learn that all is not too well between the squabbling parents . In a dinner scene with his family , we learn that his brother ( later played by Alan Yun in Gubra ) had married a Singaporean , and the relationship with the in-laws are not that cordial too . Contrasted with Orked's family , the loving parents portrayed by Ida Nerina and Harith Iskander , who share many a scene expressing their love ( which had irked Malaysian censors ) , and with a housemaid Yam ( played by Adibah Noor ) adding to the comical close knit ties within their family . But , clich√© as I may sound , love knows no bounds . Sans race , sans religion , sans family backgrounds , love will find a way . We follow their courtship , and it isn't that these obvious differences are swept beneath the carpet . No , they were brought out , and we realize the challenges that lie ahead if our couple were to be together , and to challenge these misconceptions . But in typical boy-meets-girl , boy-loves-girl , boy-loses-girl fashion , we see how their relationship loses ground when Jason confesses to Orked to have impregnated another girl . To be " fair " , he did the deed before he became committed to Orked , but felt that sense of responsibility to take care of the other . It's somewhat depressing , knowing that he and Orked are a match made , but events that transpired before meeting your soul mate , came back to haunt . I thought deeply about this , and was wondering if there was any possibility about reconciliation and forgiveness . Sometimes there will be , sometimes there will be not , but sometimes they may come too little too late . And from what Yasmin told us , I understood the ending , why it ended the way it ended , drawn from her personal experience , and the emotions I felt . But therein lies a higher objective , which I thought was a respectable Wow moment . With the way it ended , I felt that yes , I believe that Yasmin has achieved with most audiences ( unless you're on the road to no redemption ) throwing away any deep sense of prejudice , to want the two leads to be together , after the fact that is akin to riding on a ferris wheel to the top , enjoying the sights , and then being thrown over . It dawned upon me the power of her story , simply told . The movie's also peppered with plenty of movie references and subtle jokes , besides the obvious ones which you laugh out loud . There are digs at society , and some events will make you ponder , like how Orked managed to get a scholarship with 5As , when Jason actually scored 7 , and got none ( hey , VCD peddler also got the smarts , OK ! ) The chemistry between the leads is so believable , that you cannot help but fall in love with both . Jason is the atypical sam-seng boy with dyed hair , dances a quirky dance , filial son , with a heart of gold . You might presume that Orked is the demure pint-sized girl next door , but inside , she packs quite an opinionated punch , which works in her favour when battling against prejudices . And the two of them put together , genuinely make a cute couple . The musical selection is beautiful , and I was initially surprised that Sam Hui songs were used throughout the movie . They were the evergreens in Hong Kong Pop , and contributed effectively to the mood of the movie . The cinematography too emulates picturesque moments when the leads are together , be it sharing a meal or conversation in a fast food restaurant , or sitting at a pier or a bus stop to wait out the rain . Things and situations associated with budding love . There are tonnes of films out there which are loud , brash , and easily forgotten once the lights come on . I've come to appreciate smaller films which are intricately crafted , a simple story with layered complexity , and something which can endure the test of time . A story that comes straight from the heart . I believe Sepet is one of them . I like . Code 3 DVD contains behind the scenes footage ( though I had hoped it could have more ) , and the trailer . How I'd wish there would be a director and casts commentary . : - )
514998	317399	1037850	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Secret	While Jay Chou no doubt holds court in today's Mando-pop scene , he gets no love from the movie-goers who snigger at his expressionless performance in Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower . It indeed is quite brave of him ( though it's arguable to strike while the iron is hot ) to diversify and have a hand in directing so early in his cinematic career , and coming up with quite an interesting , engaging story , though like any creative work , his story did make him seem quite intelligent , in spite of his usual laid-back demeanour . Jay stars as Jay ( yeah , bring back those lazy Hong Kong production days where characters share the actor's first names , because they were working on so many movies simultaneously , it's hard to keep track , so why not name the characters after yourself ! ) , a new student in Tamkang Secondary School . He follows a mysterious piano tune and meets with Rain ( Kwai Lun-Mei ) , a fellow student with whom he starts to spend many lovey-dovey moments with . It's essentially a romance story for dating couples to catch , and it will be a definite test of anyone's cloy-tolerance , given that the lovebirds share so much saccharine sweet dialogue and behaviour , those with lesser tolerance will have goosebumps all the way . And for the romantic movie fans , it's time to revisit some of the clich√© plot elements like the bicycle ride - who can resist a bicycle ride ! - lovely scene setting landscape shots , idle banter , close contacts , dance , kisses , the " third party " Sky ( whom I think is more attractive than Kwai , thus providing that additional tension ) , the list just goes on . Jay has mentioned parts of the story was really based on his own experiences , it is indeed interesting to try and find out just which are . Being a piano student , the movie too was a showcase piece for his musical talents and prowess on the piano , coupled with computer generated graphics which enhanced certain scenes for dramatic effect with great aplomb . Those who think that Jay Chou can't act will want to rethink that again . Given Initial D was pop , and that Curse was action , Secret was a perfect dramatic platform for him to do a little more emoting , even though he can't seem to shake off his signature drawl . And of course some help to make him look good came from thespian Anthony Wong , who had also played his cinematic dad ( of similar interest / capability ) in Initial D , as he again does in Secret . Here , their father and son characters play off each other a little more in some endearing , comical moments , and naturally , Wong seemed a more believable father figure than Chow Yun-Fat for Jay Chou . The strength of the movie however laid in its story . I shall keep it a secret just exactly what it was , and all I can say is it is similar in nature to some of my favourite movies in the past , thus I had taken a natural liking for Secret as well . However , while you think you might have it all planned out how the story will unfold , Jay Chou actually had an added punch to keep it a little bit fresh , and in doing so , raises it to a slightly different level as well , with a fairly intense climax that will have you rooting for a desirable outcome , no less . What worked against it though , would be the verbatim nature in which the story was explained , making it a little draggy and at times , repetitive , instead of allowing the audience to put the pieces together . Jay Chou as story writer ( he had someone to script it for him ) , actor , director and composer , Secret turned out to be a surprisingly commendable , co mmendable effort . If this is any indication of what's to come from this talented dude , then I'll be more than happy to be a fan convert , for his cinematic efforts at least . Recommended date movie of the week , remember to bring out those tissues as well ! I won't be surprised if this movie will work its magic into my top ten list for the year .
514960	317399	768116	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Hula Girls	This is a story about change . Hula Girls , based on true events , takes place in a small Japanese coal mining town in the late 60s , where its town folks find that with the shifting reliance on oil from coal , the survival of their town is at stake when a major company decides to retrench and cut its headcount . In attempts to makeover their economy ( ain't that familiar ) , the sleepy town has decided to come up with a " Hawaii Center " , a resort like facility where the warm atmosphere of Hawaii will be recreated in their cold / coal environment . It's a drastic change from blue collar to the service industry , and with the young girls being roped in to be dance performers , the traditionalists are up in arms , against the entire project . Skimpy outfits and gyrating moves don't make it easy , and neither does an outsider being roped in to teach the girls a new skill , turn out popular too . Hula Girls , winner of many awards in the 2006 Japanese equivalent of the Oscars , and also the Japanese submission to the 2007 Oscar's Best Foreign Language film , actually seemed a little too familiar in its narrative style , bringing to mind movies such as Waterboys , Swing Girls , Linda Linda Linda , and the more obvious reference and similarity , will be that of My Mother is a Belly Dancer , well , for most of the first half anyway . But perhaps with this familiarity , it took less time for the audience to identify with it , and it set on its focus to endear the key characters to the audience . As mentioned , it's about change , set against the backdrop of changing industries , attitudes , and skills . It's a heartwarming story no less , about the strength of sisterhood , where unity sees them battling challenges ahead , much against all odds , especially when adversity comes from within . It's not all serious as it sounds , as there are ample comedy infused , especially with its outcast characters such as the nerdy mom and the plus sized tomboy , and their initial attempts at performance during road trips advertising their new attraction . Like movies in the similar genre , it doesn't take long to identify the leader of the pack , in Kimiko ( Yu Aoi ) , as she becomes the prot√©g√© of the teacher Mrs Hirayama ( Yasuko Matsuyuki ) , given the thankless task of whipping the girls into shape . Yu Aoi is no doubt the star of the movie , with her good looks and time dedicated for her to show what it takes . And expect a number of sniffles as the filmmakers weaved in classical dramatic moments primarily aimed at activating those tear ducts . At its heart , it's a movie on the triumph of the human spirit against adversity , and of friendship . It's not without its flaws , like when certain transitions seemed to suffer from lack of time devoted to provide more depth , but when the formula comes to the end , with its rousing , highly anticipated finale showed in its entirety and in full regalia , you'll no doubt be giving full of applause for its showmanship . Definitely going into my books as a contender for the best movies of the year . Highly recommended , despite its slow start .
514397	317399	1286172	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Sell Out !	My personal measure of an excellent comedy , is whether or not it reduces me to tears that roll uncontrollably coupled with some really deep-felt hearty laughter . While I'd like to pride myself with a good sense of humour , it does take some effort to really elicit that kind of a reaction from me , and Sell Out ! does that by the bucketloads , and through a variety of methods ranging from slapstick to the wry , from the staring-in-your-face obvious to the wink-wink-insider-jokes too . Yeo Joon Han dug deep into his plethora of talent , wearing the hats for producing , writing , editing , directing and , check this out - writing the songs ( lyrics and music composition ) as well ! And the songs are a definite highlight of the film , while not so much a musical per-se , but does have characters breaking into song to move the narrative forward . And in true , witty nature , look out for that moment that calls for YOUR participation ! Jack Neo may feel threatened that Joon Han's Money song easily rivals those he oft feature in his Money No Enough series , but my personal fan-favourite amongst the tunes would be " You're Not My Type " , with Jerrica Lai and Peter Davis delivering a duet that has to be experienced with proper sound on the big screen for its wonderful accompanying visuals that capture character emotions just perfectly . From the get go , Joon Han delivers every step of the way , all the way to the final frame , without condescending nor making the audience feel stupid . Rather , he turned the tables on himself first , in self-deprecating fashion to introduce himself as an arty-farty director and pokes fun at question-and-answer , art and commercial films , and you'll even be treated to a screening of his award winning short with some really inane dialogue . From that point on with your attention arrested , Joon Han throws every subject into the narrative almost effortlessly , with themes that are easily identifiable , but always keeping an eye out to ensure that the fun factor in every scene is never lost . Sell Out ! boasts some superb " mo-lei-tau " scenes coming in from the blind side to tickle that funny bone of yours , capturing little things that irritate in life and provide a fun spin to them , from pop culture to SMS reality shows , and who would know that Death could be so funny as well . There's a really brilliant scene in the film alongside a deathbed that encompassed plenty , and makes it all the more worthwhile for repeated viewings just to catch every possible punchline from that scene . Those paying close attention during the film will be richly rewarded with plenty of funny nuances that we would immediately guffaw at , and sly subtitles also have a life of their own , to hilarious effect . But it's not always all fun and games , and that's why this film is such the gem that it is . There's a clear commentary about doing work with heart , and wanting to be appreciated for a job well done , versus gritting your teeth and doing something that betrays your moral conscience . There's also a sharp underlying critique on modern society in general , and on corporate governance ( or the lack thereof ! ) since what more could you expect from a conglomerate that calls itself FONY and has a one-liner , though succinctly easy to understand mission statement , to " make money " , which is after all , the basic reasons for corporations to exist . The cast too are gutsy enough to trust the debut feature filmmaker , lending their vocals and performing the songs many themselves . I'd like to think that this could have also been a romance , with Eric Tan ( Peter Davis ) the honest and un-business savvy engineer with his 8-in-1 Super Soya Maker , being infatuated with Rafflesia Pong ( Jerrica Lai ) the ruthless , uncompromising go-getter who cannot wait to show her rival , the hot pan-Asian Hanna Edwards Leong ( Hannah Lo ) a thing or two about the ratings game . Then we have the scene stealers with Kee Thuan Chye and Lim Teik Leong as the Smoking and Forgetful CEOs respectfully , encompassing what we dread and probably hate most about corporate bosses who think they can get away with anything in the name of profits . There are some wonderful characterization amongst the leads , with an ensemble supporting cast to add colour , which reminded me of Citizen Dog when the man in the street joins in for a chorus about Money . Rarely has a film captured so much in under 120 minutes and making sense of it all through well-placed humour . As such , Sell Out ! has my firm vote as a personal favourite and the best of the Festival thus far , being the breath of fresh air amongst many stuffy entries that had misplaced artistic merits , alienating themselves from audiences who feel that in depressing times , we can't help but reject yet another self-indulgent movie . Sell OUt ! has nothing of that , and has set itself as a contender for my year end roundup of the best offerings in 2009 . If it was left up to me , I'd give this film both the Best Film and Best Director prizes at the Silver Screen Awards at the SIFF . The commercial release is due soon on May 7 on both sides of the Causeway , so whatever you do , please make Sell Out ! your must watch ( ! - I must exclaim this ) movie this year ! Join the Facebook group here ! And get the soundtrack from the shops while waiting for it to hit the screens ! Support good storytelling , and enjoy a great film !
515383	317399	796307	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Under the Same Moon	It's been a while since I experienced in the movies , a mother's love for her young child , and vice versa , being the primary focus of the film , especially with one that dealt with distance and longing . The last one that truly moved me was the Japanese film Be With You , and no prizes for guessing that this Mexican number Under the Same Moon will join its ranks . The title is nothing new though , as with movies as far back like An American Tale , where its theme song played on that exact same premise , of having to gaze up at the moon knowing that the person in your heart is probably doing the same thing and thinking of you too . Yes , such saccharine sweet sentimentalism , but it worked wonders here . Directed by first time feature helmer Patricia Riggen , the movie follows both mother and son characters in separate threads , having been separated for many years , but keeping in touch through weekly Sunday telephone calls from public phone booths both sides . For Carlitos ( Adrian Alonso ) , despite the gifts that mom sends back home to him , he misses her much and prefers that she is back in Mexico rather than working in the US . For mom Rosario ( Kate del Castillo ) , she smuggled herself illegally to Los Angeles for work in order to raise their lot . But when his guardian grandmother passes away , Carlitos begins to plot his way to get himself to the LA within the week , to look for Rosario lest she calls home and worries that he's missing . So begins the adventures of Carlitos as he begins to learn that the world is indeed full of unseen bad folks who will not hesitate to traffic him to child smugglers . And many of the scenes for his character have him interact with a reluctant surrogate father figure in fellow illegal Enrique ( Eugenio Derbez ) . For Rosario , her character piece becomes like a showcase of the much generalized exploitation of illegal workers , as well as going through the usual aspirations of being a naturalized citizen so that she can finally bring her son over for reunification . Otherwise for the most parts she's often debating within herself whether it's high time to return to Mexico since her intention and goal seem to slip by every day , given being swindled as we are told , by her previous owner , and of course making sense of the love that a fellow Mexican has for her . Some might complain that they can probably see how the story would develop as it wore on , but you have to admit that Adrian Alonso's charismatic Carlitos will still have you engaged throughout with that cherubic face of his , brimming with faith and confidence . While he might have started off pondering a lot on why his mom did what she have to do , soon he will learn , and we accompany him on this journey , a thing or two about love and concern . Given that he doesn't share the same screen for the most parts with his mum , it sort of became key that he constructs and builds upon his initial dislike for Enrique much like a parallel contrast with that relationship with his mother , up until the final moments which was probably a bit deus ex machina , and felt a little rushed somehow . But on the whole , Under the Same Moon serves its purpose and delivered itself well thanks to its great casting . And it also makes for a perfect date movie too , with a reminder to bring along some Kleenex for the finale . Highly recommended .
515410	317399	397535	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Memoirs of a Geisha	It's been a long wait for the movie to come to our shores , and I'd tell you it's all well worth it . Having touted many directors ' involvement with this project ( like Steven Spielberg , who's now producer ) , Rob Marshall finally got chosen to helm Arthur Golden's bestseller . And having an all recognizable Asian cast to shoulder this Hollywood production , is an achievement in itself in my opinion . To the detractors who were up in arms over the casting of non-Japanese actresses as the leads , what's up with you ? Sure they're not natives from the land of the rising sun , but bear in mind this is a Hollywood production , and it's all about the business too . Having actresses that the West are not familiar with , is like taking too huge a gamble . So we have Zhang Ziyi as the protagonist , whom a number would be familiar after her turn out in the caper Rush Hour 2 , as with Michelle Yeoh with her stint as a Bond girl in Tomorrow Never Dies . Gong Li would be familiar to those in the art house circuit with Wong Kar Wai's 2046 making its rounds . We do have Japanese in the movie , though mainly the male leads like Ken Watanabe ( after a dismal appearance in summer blockbuster Batman Begins ) and Cary-Hiroyuki " Mortal Kombat " Tagawa . And it's indeed commendable effort from the actresses fronting the movie , having to learn and be convincing in the age old culture of the Geishas . There's another camp who're lobbying that the film is not accurate . Hello , this is a movie , based on a fictional novel . You want accuracy , go watch a documentary or something . Perhaps the only thing I found peculiar was the addition of the English subtitles , as if the Asians cannot speak properly and audiences need help to decipher their accented English ? Zhang Ziyi plays Chiyo / Sayuri , the daughter of a fisherman who got sold away as a young girl to a Geisha house . It's the usual rags-to-fame storyline , where rookie gets bullied , endures hardship , and one day , with a bit of luck , gets the opportunity to become one of the most famous in their profession of choice . And indeed the strength lay in Ziyi Zhang's competence in pulling off this coup , acting opposite 2 other accomplished actresses . Gong Li plays Hatsumomo , a famous Geisha in her time , by with a wild , arrogant streak in her . She feels threatened by the arrival of the young girl Chiyo , and goes all out to frame and make life difficult for her . From the start , you know that these two characters have hatred running through their veins . It's interesting to see Ziyi and Li pair up - 2046 doesn't count as they didn't share scenes together . Both were once director's Zhang Yimou's muses , with Ziyi touted as the new Gong Li when she emerged from the scene . They do share some similar facial features , and it's somewhat strangely satisfying watching their cat-fights on screen , as if it's a wicked tale of Celebrity Deathmatch . Michelle Yeoh plays Mameha , another famous Geisha in her time , and here , she takes on a more mature role , developing a mentor-prot√©g√© relationship with Chiyo / Sayuri . Mameha teaches and refines Chiyo , and orchestrates her , if I may use the word , career of Sayuri . From the onset , Mameha has big plans for Sayuri , and we see the politicking side of the world of the Geisha , of becoming famous , of crafting a reputation , and the deft plotting that one must adept to in order to survive in the dog-eat-dog business world . Michelle and Ziyi paired off in Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as adversaries , and probably had memorable scenes together when fighting off each other in the rooftop and teahouse battles . Here , they go to the other side of the spectrum in becoming " sisters " as they coordinate to outwit , outplay and outlast Hatsumomo . The most interesting would probably be the second act where we witness the meteoric rise of Sayuri . We are introduced proper into the complex Geisha life of rules and protocols , accompanied by the brilliant score of John Williams ' and with Yo-Yo Ma on the cellos . The beautiful costumes and rich sets also become testament that the filmmakers spare no effort in bringing Kyoto , and the world of the Geisha , to life . Perhaps the third act of the film , set after World War II , was the weakest of the three , as it seemed rushed to achieve closure for the romance between Sayuri and the Chairman ( Ken Watanabe ) . It's a love that cannot be expressed freely , although one which had started from an infatuation , from respect , and became an obsessive fuel to become the best . With face and reputation at stake , it's truthfully sad that this is no period Pretty Woman . Perhaps the only uplifting moment in the third act , is the unexpected twist of betrayal , that you'll never see that patient stab in the back until it is too late . It's a beautifully complex movie , and I'm amazed by how much can be weaved into what is seemingly a straightforward plot . This movie might give non-readers an excuse to pick up the book to learn more and dwell deeper into the psyche of the characters . But first , be enthralled by the movie , a must-watch this January .
514880	317399	1060253	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Gone Shopping	Singaporeans are known for our passion for food , be it either great tasting humble hawker fare , or exquisite fine dining at various swanky restaurants . Food has been featured in a number of our local movies , with yellow flat noodles being the Mee Pok in Mee Pok Man , Chicken Rice in Chicken Rice War , and the ubiquitous coffeeshop locales in almost all of director Jack Neo's movies . The other passion we have is for shopping , no doubt with our most famous road being Orchard Road , for its malls and food of course , and the various generic shopping malls ( with almost the same shops , that each mall seemed xeroxed from the preceding success story ) that have sprung up in various neighbourhood heartland town centers all over the island . It's only a matter of time that a movie like Gone Shopping will find its way to our cinematic screens , with its premise firmly set around our obsession with shopping , which some have said is one of our national pastimes . Writer-director Wee Li Lin , better known for her short films , makes her feature film debut with this movie , and it actually took her years to crystallize her ideas for the film . After all , if you want to incorporate a national pastime , you sure would want to do it right ! But what Li Lin did was a whole lot more . Gone Shopping , through its many characters , leading and supporting , all manage to touch on the psyche of Singapore . Having developed a keen eye in observing people , Li Lin managed to craft intricate characters for Gone Shopping , without the pitfalls of having caricature them into typical stereotypes . The first few minutes were pure genius , adding a subtle tracking of the evolvement of our malls and its impact to our pop culture ( remember the Centrepoint kids ? ) through the eyes of one of the protagonist , Clara ( played by Kym Ng ) , a rich man's tai-tai ( translated by the official website as " wealthy lady of leisure " ) who seem to have everything material , but yearning for a connection that is deep and emotional . And starting with Clara , we get introduced to the various hopes and dreams of the characters in Gone Shopping , which I thought was interesting and intriguing enough to hold you attention , and want to make you find out more as the story unravels . Through three story arcs whose characters rarely interact with one another , they share a common thread , and that is the need to escape from the cold harsh realities of their unsatisfactory life , through , what else , their various periods of stay in malls , where they can enjoy some bliss in their respective fantasies . Clara longs to be loved and run away from the superficiality of " tai-tai friendships " , and bumping into an acquaintance , Valentine Pang ( Adrian Pang ) , a sales person in a departmental store and old school classmate , may just provide that avenue . Aaron Ho ( Aaron Kao ) , a young man stifled in his 9-to-5 job , seeks out friends in the mall , and slowly develops the hots for his best friend's sister Hui Hui ( Magdalene Tan ) , a goth lolita . Renu ( Sonya Nair ) , an 8 year old girl who finds herself abandoned and unloved by her parents , seeking out a new life in the world famous Mustafa Centre , a mall that does not sleep , enjoying the material goods she could possibly never possess , and being caught in a web of intrigue between a conman , and the store's security personnel . Gone Shopping reveals a thick tapestry based on strengths of Li Lin's imaginative mind , and engages the audiences at different levels . Like a shopping mall itself , the movie is full of differen tcomponents that will appeal to different demographics , but yet all coming together to make it a completely satisfying experience . Some scenes were just so cunningly full of wit , that you can't help but to crack up for its sheer brilliance and cheekiness . The actors too , from familiar TV faces past and present , flesh their roles with aplomb , and are a delight to watch . I only rue that the wonderful Adrian Pang didn't get a lot of screen time , and his moustache does make him look kinda serious , departing miles away from his funnyman persona . What is superb too for a local film , are the cinematography and art direction . The colours are beautiful to look at , building upon those already available in the malls ' surroundings , and scenes come alive with its many locations that audiences would find familiar . After all , we do visit these places from time to time for our dose of retail therapy . And for the overseas audience , you're in for a real visual treat as well , as Gone Shopping made the malls actually look sexy , and for those who have been here before , take a look if you can recall where they were . While it is obvious these places are touristy and would make Singapore Tourism Board beam with brimming pride , it doesn't , not for a minute , look like a huge " Come Visit Singapore / Come Shop in Singapore " commercial , which is great . Retail therapy might pay off to chase those blues away , but Gone Shopping certainly is well worth the admission ticket , being able to straddle the arty film realm that most local movies seem to fall under , and having the commercial legs as well . If Singapore movies are growing from strength to strength with each output , then Gone Shopping has certainly stamped its mark for 2007 . Highly recommended !
515547	317399	1220719	10.0	A Nutshell Review : Ip Man	I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie ! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes , with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen . While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung ( in the Tsui Hark movies ) , Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless , after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films . And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off , and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned , with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster . In this bio-pic , Ip Man , one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity , gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan , China , where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training . With each new school , the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel . Ip Man , an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts , will take them on behind closed doors , so as not to damage his opponents ' reputation nor embarrass them in public . His humility is his virtue , and his style is never violent or aggressive , which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate , since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman . The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war , and it's not all fight and no story . Witth this historical setting , at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told , with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese , and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit , fail to unite during dire straits . More often than note , martial arts become a unifying force , and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory . But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan , and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator , there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community . The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains , often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura ( Hiroyuki Ikeuchi ) , a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao ( Fan Siu Wong ) as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese . Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight , where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid , and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces . So what's the verdict on the action ? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action , and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit , they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie , such as private fights in his home , a factory m√™l√©e , a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer , ( which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers , mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka ) being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury , and a ringside duel amongst others . And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action , but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well . It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite , though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable final battle comes rolling along and gets delivered with aplomb . I'm no Wing Chun practitioner , but Donnie Yen has this marvelous calm and zen like approach with his Ip Man taking out his opponents quite effectively with the minimal of moves . Like Huo Yuan Jia , he doesn't deliver the killing blows to friendly opponents , but rather simulates the various hit points , which actually calls for some astonishing control of strength and precision . This approach will change of course as the opponents become anything but friendly . And unlike the usual martial arts stance of crouching low , here we see him standing tall and striking with such precision and efficiency , it's like poetry in motion with some astounding closed quarter combat utilizing plenty of upper limb strength . With Wong Kar-wai at one point also declaring interest in making a Ip Man movie , I thought that this effort will be hard to beat , just like how Tsui Hark has crafted some of the more definitive movies in modern times about Wong Fei Hung and Jet Li benefiting from a major career boost , I'd say Ip Man just about cements Yen's reputation as a martial arts leading man , which I guess the cinematic world these days severely lacks . This has to go down in my books as one of my favorite movies of the year , and I'm already setting some money aside to get the best available edition of the DVD when it gets released . Highly recommended , so make a beeline for the box office now !
