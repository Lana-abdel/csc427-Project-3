493332	3280905	36715	3.0	A Curious Failure	This film was the first one to star Boris Karloff that was in color . As such , it illustrates that to be the first of anything is meaningless if the film lacks coherence , intelligence , and a decent script . The plot begins by taking the viewers into an old theater , where Karloff is shown coming night after night . He has the sympathies of the staff of the theater . It seems that ten years earlier he was engaged to the prima donna singer at the theater , and they were to get married . But on the night before the marriage she vanished , and he - broken hearted ( apparently ) - has returned every night ever since as though waiting for her . Now this could have been the start of an intriguing film . Unfortunately the scriptwriters did not see fit to leave the audience tantalized by Karloff's apparent tragedy . Instead , he falls asleep in his chair and we see his subconscious revealing what happened . The prima donna broke off the wedding in a bitter argument , and Karloff killed her ( but as they were alone , he was able to hide the body and cover his tracks ) . So instead of playing with audience support for Karloff , the script writers show he is up to his typical evil roles . The only one who suspects that Karloff is not what he seems is Gale Sondergaard - she remembers what her former mistress was like that night , and there were signs that she was uncertain about the wedding . But she never had anything concrete to work with . The theater impresario is Thomas Gomez . One of his musicians / composers ( Turhan Bey ) is interested in furthering the career of a new singer , Susannah Foster , whom he is dating . Gomez is willing to put her on . But Karloff , who is the theater's doctor , sees Foster ( who reminds him of the dead prima donna ) . Fixed on her , he decides to pursue her ( although she is increasingly frightened of him ) . This is the set-up for the plot , and how it eventually leads to the revelation of the fate of the dead woman . It is a tired plot , mostly because there is little chemistry between Foster and Karloff ( although that is not a fatal flaw - he is fixed on her , she need not show any type of fascination towards him ) . Sondergaard is wasted ( occasionally , as the film progresses , she reveals her suspicions ) . Gomez , normally a considerably good villain himself , plays his jovial side as the impresario . As for Turhan Bey , he shows great interest in Foster - and she is shown singing in one of his new operettas ( the music of which is a steal from Schubert's Marche Militaire ) . The end result is that the viewer is not deeply interested ( after awhile ) in the fates of these characters . Even when Karloff ( at one point ) knocks out Ludwig Stossel , our lack of interest in the " little old wine maker " actor prevents us getting too concerned ( Ludwig recovers by the way ) . Given that the film was supplied with a grade A film gloss ( by using color stock ) it is ironic that the whole effect is basically thrown away . It does not help matters , to the fans of Boris Karloff , that one year after this color-film flop , he gave one of his greatest performances in Val Lewton's THE BODY SNATCHER as Grey the Coachman - in a black and white film with a meaty script . Instead of Technicolor , the production people should have concentrated on good writing and plotting . I will give it a " 3 " only because it is visually good , but otherwise it was a waste of time and money .
492726	3280905	48413	3.0	A Ridiculous View of a Historical Titan	Except that this film is short , I was tempted to call it " NAPOLEON BLOWN-APART " , but that suggests the film is actually long and has some degree of detail . THis monstrosity is under ninety minutes . There are short films about Napoleon , but they concentrate on one aspect of the man . CONQUEST deals with Napoleon and his Polish mistress . DESIREE with his relationship with Desiree Clary Bernadotte , the future Queen of Sweden . This was Sacha Guitry's attempt to do a complete account of Napoleon's thirty year career as a world figure , in a totally inadequate amount of time . The French version of the film actually has some continuity lacking in the English version . But most people in the U . S . have seen ( if they have seen it at all ) the English version . It is best known because of the cameo appearances , in particular of Orson Welles as General Hudson Lowe ( who ? - he's the British official who was appointed to be the jailer of Napoleon on St . Helena , but who managed to botch his assignment ) and Eric Von Stroheim ( very briefly ) as Beethoven . Guitry , a talented boulevardier type , essayed the role of Talleyrand . None are shown to great advantage . It is set ( apparently ) in 1821 , with Guitry in his Paris salon , talking to his intellectual friends , upon hearing the death of his former master . To be truthful , knowing Talleyrand , he would have said a word or two about Napoleon but then turned to more interesting current matters . The film does not go into the collapse of the relationship between the great Emperor and his gifted Foreign Secretary . Talleyrand was noted for his selfish ability to destroy a government that was no longer benefiting him , and then reappear in a more powerful position in the next regime . He helped destroy about seven of them , including Napoleon's . Historians have despised his selfishness , but they have usually praised him for knowing when to ditch the Emperor ( Talleyrand was wary of the constant warfare , which the Emperor did not seem to know when to stop - he seemed to be using war to cover previous failures of policy , and to build up his remarkable reputation ) . The final blow was when Napoleon discovered that Talleyrand had been contacting Metternich and other foreign adversaries about undercutting Napoleon's diplomatic forays . In front of the whole court Napoleon cursed out Talleyrand , calling him a silk stocking full of " merde " . He then left the court with his chief courtiers . Talleyrand watched thoughtfully , and said , " How sad that such a great man is so vulgar ! " He redoubled his activities , assisted by his rival and foe ( usually , but not here ) Joseph Fouche , the head of the secret police . In 1814-15 they beat Napoleon at last . None of this is in the movie ( at least the English version ) that we see . Talleyrand is very philosophical , telling the story of the rise , fall , and rise of Napoleon and his legend . But in cramming the events from 1785 to 1821 we get a too rapid outline . The film though does even more than this . Talleyrand tells of how Napoleon's remains are returned to France for burial in Les Invalides ( his magnificent tomb in Paris ) . But this happened in 1840 , ordered by King Louis Philippe for popularity reasons . Only problem is that Talleyrand was dead by 1838 . Since Welles is in the film for about two minutes , I might as well discuss this . In 1955 he was filming CONFIDENTAL REPORT ( a . k . a . MR . ARKADIN ) , and ( like OTHELLO ) he was partly paying for it himself . So Welles was willing to appear in many films ( especially in France ) in bit cameo roles . His part is that of Lowe , who was a mediocre military figure who got the job as a last choice ( the first choice , the Duke of Wellington , felt he and Bonaparte could never share an island together ) . Lowe was introduced to Bonaparte in the latter's residence of Longwood , and Bonaparte was polite like a host . But Lowe just glowered at him ( as Welles does here ) . Bonaparte , quickly judging the idiot that he was stuck with , put his own hat on to show his contempt . It never improved , but we only see this scene . After Bonaparte died , his aides wanted a suitable tomb for him , but every time they presented a statement for the tombstone ( General of the Armies , Emperor of France ) , Lowe turned down the recommendation . In disgust , they suggested a blank tombstone . Stupidly , Lowe agreed ( as a surprised Welles does ) . Lowe never realized how truly eloquent the empty tombstone was - loyal Bonapartists from around the globe would know at that tombstone that no words could describe the giant who was under it adequately . Napoleon really did not need Les Invalides , but the French wanted to do it properly . The film is a total waste as a decent historical chronicle . Catch the 1927 Abel Gance classic , or CONQUEST or even DESIREE ( even though it is a wretched film in it's own right - at least it gives the viewer some idea of how Sweden's modern royal family came into power ) . Catch the Armand Assante two part television movie about Napoleon and Josephine . But , unless you want to see all of Orson Welles or Eric Von Stroheim's performances , ignore this one . For Orson and Eric I give this a three .
491607	3280905	41255	4.0	Montgomery's Farewell to the Movies	After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL , Robert Montgomery ( for the most time ) came into his finest films and performances : HERE COMES MR . JORDAN , THEY WERE EXPENDABLE , THE LADY IN THE LAKE , RIDE THE PINK HORSE , THE SAXON CHARM , JUNE BRIDE . Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable ( RAGE IN HEAVEN , MR . AND MRS . SMITH ) . But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work . In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang , an egotistical movie star , who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend . Apparently my view of this film is a minority view . Most of the views given are favorable about it . I thought it was a dull , witless script , with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very appealing as a character . She admires Montgomery as a star , and this " helps " when he is called in to assist the authorities , but after awhile I found there was no chemistry between them . The script was also devoid of much fun , although Montgomery and Roland Winters did try . The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth , and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill . So he always dresses up as Churchill , and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat , smoking a large cigar , and painting ( Holmes ' bald head helps in the disguise ) . That was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memory . Montgomery went into early television , and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures . His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William " Bull " Halsey , starring his friend Jimmy Cagney . It is a far better film than this . For his overall film and television career , I will give this mediocre film a " 4 " . That strikes me as generous .
492360	3280905	49369	4.0	When will this be released again ?	This is the great mystery movie for fans of Hope and Hepburn . First of all it is the sole time they ever appeared in any movie together . Secondly it is dated - it has to be seen recalling what the heart of the Cold War was like in 1956 , the year of the Hungarian Up-rising and the Suez Crisis . Apparently it is more available for viewing in Great Britain ( it was a British film ) . I have never seen it listed on any American television station . Isn't it about time they would show it - just to settle our curiosity about this particular pairing ? My suspicion it would not be great movie viewing , but it would be interesting anyway . At least we could compare it to it's " cold war " film comedy predecessors ( NINOTCHKA , COMRADE X , and SILK STOCKINGS ) . Addendum : February 20 , 2008 - Finally I see the film . Some films have to be seen to see why they were never repeated . Bob Hope did enjoy working with certain actresses many times , most notably Dorothy Lamour and Lucille Ball . But he made this one film ( in 1956 ) that was with Kate Hepburn , and it is certainly not the best film either of them ever played in . Both were highly capable performers / stars . Both were good in comedy . But there is no chemistry between them , and they are in roles they don't fit . Hope is a hotshot heroic U . S . pilot , hoping to marry an English aristocrat ( Noelle Madison ) for financial reasons . He is pushed into an assignment by his commanding officer ( and supposed friend ) Alan Gifford to put his romance on hold while romancing Russian pilot - heroine Kate Hepburn . Now Hepburn is not defecting . She took her MIG fighter ( this film may be the first that mentioned the term " MIG " for a Russian plane ) to England out of anger at being by-passed for a promotion for an inferior rival who is a man . She is not anti-Communist , and Gifford's hopes that Hope will make her into a propaganda victory for the West . The Russians are led by James Robertson Justice ( supposedly the head of a trade commission - it was a running joke that trade commissions on both sides were loaded with KGB and CIA agents ) . He is determined to bring Hepburn back to face trial as a traitor to Russia . He uses the services of her helpless ex-boyfriend Robert Helpmann . But Helpmann is really a weak reed to lean on . Justice tries alternative ideas , including kidnapping Hepburn when she is with Hope , Gifford , a jealous Madison , a Senator from Alabama ( Alexander Gauge ) , Madison's cousin ( Nicholas Phipps ) , and an air force major ( Paul Carpenter ) . This too fails , despite the large number of agents that Justice brings with him ( they include " Carry On " Sid James , Tutte Lemkow ( from A SHOT IN THE DARK , THE WRONG ARM OF THE LAW , and THE WRONG BOX ) , and David Kosloff - Carl in INDISCREET ) . Also on hand , in one sequence , is Richard Wattis as a woman's clothing store manager . It just doesn't work . The sequence in the nightclub is the best highlight in the film , due to the accidental failure of each plot that Justice tries to spirit Hepburn away , but it's not one of the great moments of comedy ( Madison is the best in the sequence , though Gauge's really dense senator has some fun talking with Nicholas Phipps about why the British drive on the left side of the road ) . Really the lack of chemistry between the stars does the film in . ugh Hepburn tries to develop some but Hope can't relate to her . I think it's because she is too cerebral an actress . He was at home with someone like Lamour or Hedy Lamarr or Joan Fontaine , who was regular not sparkling . I don't think he ever realized what a misfire the casting opposite Kate was until it was too late . The irony is I can't see this story working well with many actors . It has been suggested that Tony Curtis ( who did a film at this time , THE PERFECT FURLOUGH , set in Paris - as a military man ) , and maybe Nathalie Wood might have worked well . But it's hard to say . It does not look well compared with other similar plots . Hepburn's purchase of western feminine dinner clothes reminds one of a similar trick in NINOTCHKA where Garbo bought that symbolic Paris hat . Similarly , Hepburn's attempts to teach Hope how to accept Communism does resemble how Garbo tries to indoctrinate Melvin Douglas . But Douglas actually does show an interest in communist theory ( to the fright of his butler ) . Hope really could not care less ( although when he gets drugged he starts mumbling about Bakunin and the " Iron Law of Wages " ) . The Gable - Hedy Lamarr film COMRADE X also was clever , particularly in the spoof of the Stalin - Trotsky rivalry between Oscar Homolka and Vladimir Sobeloff . Let's face it , those two films were far better than this . SILK STOCKINGS is a musical version of NINOTCHKA , but it's Cole Porter's music , with Astaire and Cyd Charisse's dancing , and there are some good swipes at Hollywood and American's lackadaisical view of other country's cultures . It too is far more worthy of watching than this film . Now that I have seen it , I will give the film only a " 4 " for the scene in the nightclub . But please , don't bother with this film if you really like Hope's best work , or like Hepburn's better comic parts as in DESK SET or ADAM'S RIB ( with a more chemically correct film partner in both : oh Spencer , where were you ? ) .
492819	3280905	888394	4.0	A Bad View of a Television Favorite	Throughout the 1950s Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz ( with Viviene Vance and William Frawley ) made television history by the first really great comedy show and sit-com show ( one that has never stopped being available on television , half a century afterward ! ) . The daffy Lucy and her crazy schemes ( usually to get into show business ) were quite amusing in all their variety , with many guests stars ( who all knew her husband , band leader " Ricky Ricardo " ) . This show that centered upon Milton Berle is not for Lucy lovers . Once you see it , you will never be able to fully like Lucy again . You see , the plot of this episode deals with Ricky being involved in a show being put on by Berle . Lucy is accompanying him . Berle had done an episode on THE LUCY-DESI COMEDY HOUR at this time , and had done some of his shtick , such as trying to leave Lucy's house in a " drag " outfit . Here , it is Berle being willing to allow Lucy to do her " shtick " . Problem is you are taking her out of her normal situation . What I mean is this : On I LOVE LUCY or THE LUCY - DESI COMEDY HOUR or the later LUCY SHOW ( or HERE'S LUCY ) the writers centered the story on Lucy , so that we ( the audience ) knew she would do something odd because circumstances in the plot dictated it . If she tried to get into Ricky's show , his resistance ( she could certainly do a small walk on ) was so harsh that we sympathized with her desire to appear - even if we knew her talent was small at best . Here what happened is that Berle and Lucy are in a " questionable " situation in Berle's rooms at night , when he is in his robe . Ricky does not know about it , but could easily learn about it if Lucy allows him to . And that's just it : Lucy has tried to get Berle to agree to letting her into the show , but Berle knows Ricky is opposed to it . Now Lucy threatens to reveal the circumstances of the " questionable " situation of the previous night to Berle's wife and Ricky , unless he lets her into the show . Berle is horrified and tries to reason with her , but she is adamant about her threat unless she gets her part . This is possibly the equivalent for I LOVE LUCY of the " jumping the shark " incident for HAPPY DAYS . It is the point where the audience reevaluates a beloved television figure , and finds something wanting . The " Fonz " was always in control of situations , but his willingness to do a fool-hearty act like the one with the shark stretched credibility in him to the breaking point and beyond . Here Lucy's daffiness , hitherto somewhat endearing ( she never wanted to hurt anyone ) ended with her turning into a shrill , vicious little blackmailer . I have to admit that my watching this episode ended when I saw Lucy's torturing Berle . I don't think I ever wanted to see someone slap her before . There was more to the episode than this . There is a second plot about a valuable jewel Lucy has accidentally gotten into her possession that was stolen by George Macready and Mike Mazurki . I never saw the rest of the episode - I suppose at the end they were arrested and the jewel returned to it's owner . But the business with Lucy's treatment of Berle soured me to the entire show . I saw this about seven years ago , being a summer rerun . I guess they thought it was a forgotten episode of THE LUCY - DESI COMEDY HOUR . It has not been shown since , from what I can see . Maybe that is just as well .
493443	3280905	660820	5.0	Twentieth Century Disasters meet a " Flying Dutchman "	A bit of background is needed here . In the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic , some of those who were in the water , but were pulled up into the lifeboats , still died as a result of exposure . The most notable victim among these was John Philips , one of the two brave wireless men - the other was Harold Bride - who kept sending distress messages for the two and a half hours the Titanic was sinking : Philips died just before the Carpathia arrived . The Carpathia and other rescue ships had to spend some time picking up hundreds of corpses . Not all of the 1500 odd victims were found - many floated away hundreds of miles until their bodies sank . But a little over two hundred were actually retrieved and buried on land ( mostly in Halifax , Canada ) . In the shifting of the bodies from the actually living survivors , four dead bodies were left in a rubber collapsible boat . A few weeks after they were left , the boat was found again by one of the other " rescue vessels " , and rather than return these decaying corpses , they were wrapped up and tied to the collapsible , and the collapsible allowed to be deflated and sunk into the Atlantic . It is believed that this particular story is the basis for the " NIGHT GALLERY " episode known as LONE SURVIVOR , although an older sea legend is connected , as well as the tale of the man who fled the Titanic and was supposedly wearing a dress or a woman's shawl ( most likely candidate for that was a steerage passenger named Patrick Buckley , who was wearing a shawl ) . The episode on " NIGHT GALLERY " dealt with a lifeboat of the Titanic found floating in the North Atlantic ( more precisely , floating off the coast of southern Ireland near the Old Head of Kinsale ) on May 7 , 1915 . There is a dazed man in it , and he is alive . How has he been able to survive for three years ? The episode was not the best written - except for occasional segments of the new series , Sterling's crisp writing from THE TWILIGHT ZONE was not as obvious in his second , lesser series . The Captain of the ship ( Torin Thatcher ) and the ship's doctor ( Hedley Mattingly ) try to deal with this strange survivor ( John Colicos ) only to find that he is as dazed about why he has been at sea for three years as they are . He can recall the night to remember , but he needs awhile to remember the details . Eventually he realizes that he is the Flying Dutchman - he is a specter who is doomed ( as punishment for fleeing the Titanic in the place of a woman ) to be at sea , saved from one doomed ship to go to another doomed ship forever . He tells Mattingly to warn Thatcher that the Lusitania will be torpedoed that day off Ireland . Mattingly does tell a dismissive Thatcher , but then Thatcher notices that Mattingly and the other crew and passengers seemed to have disappeared . A moment later we see the wake of torpedo and hear the explosion . The last moments of the episode ( of course ) shows that some forty one year , in July 1956 , off Nantucket , Massachusetts , a lifeboat from the Lusitania is spotted with one survivor in it - and picked up by the crew of the Andrea Doria . If one figured out the timing of the years between Titanic and the second disaster , it was pretty easy to figure out what unnamed ship picked up the lone survivor in the Titanic lifeboat . Oddly enough they jumped to the next famous luxury liner disaster - they could have chosen ( instead ) to pick , say , the " Vestris " or the " Morro Castle " or the " Dara " from that forty year period . If the acting was sufficiently good to keep one watching , the story was not compelling enough to merit the retelling . One interesting feature regarding one of the performers . Hedley Mattingley was in many television shows , most notably in DAKTARI with Marshall Thompson in the middle 1960s . His appearance here is a decent performance ( complete with beard ) but nothing special there . What is special is a little ironic . If you check his thread on this board , Mattingley was born on May 7 , 1915 ! He came in just as the Lusitania left the scene .
492028	3280905	507782	5.0	A Below Par Episode For This Series	I have usually said that the best episodes of ONE STEP BEYOND were able to hold the attention of the viewer even if the viewer was skeptical about the subject matter . This particular episode actually was below average - the subject matter did not live up to the build up , despite the tragedy at the conclusion . Alex Peters ( Frank Maxwell ) has a crippled daughter named Carolyn , and is concerned when he realizes he hasn't long to live . He tries to set up a trust fund for the daughter , but lacks the funds . So , in desperation he decides he has to rob the bank . George Chambers ( Ralph Nelson ) is married to Ellen ( Roberta Haynes ) . George and Ellen live quite well . He has a job at the bank . Then Ellen gives him some news she forgot to tell him that there is going to be a bank examiner coming in a few days . George collapses in fear - it seems he has been living better than he should on his salary because he is embezzling money . So George runs to the bank to repair the books as best as he can . So two lines of fate are drawn to that branch of the bank . George gets there first , and starts repairing the books as best as he can . But then Alex shows up and holds up the bank . Of course , by doing that Alex is making George's attempts at repair less and less plausible : once the robbery occurs a full audit will be needed to see what was stolen , and the defalcation will really be glaring . So George tries to stop the robbery . Alex shoots and kills George , but this enables a guard to shoot and kill Alex . Here's the weakness though . Newland's epilogue asks why did the forces of the universe cause two men to end each other's lives . But that's just it - they didn't end each other's lives . There was no mutual killing here . George was not armed - he was shot by Alex . But another person shot Alex . Unless that third person's story was as twisted as these two you can't make a case of the forces of the universe causing mutual destruction .
491694	3280905	45837	6.0	A Film That Disappeared	This was a nice film - an average comic adventure story and nothing more . At the time it was made it's star , Red Skelton was really concentrating on his very successful comedy variety show on television that would last until the 1970s . He still would make movies , but they were no longer an absolute necessity . Skelton was one of the first stars in Hollywood that realized that far from being a useful stop-gap for periods that you were not making films or on stage , television had a logic and rhythm of it's own that when studied and applied was just as good as the other mediums . He must have realized this from his years working on the similar , but somewhat limited medium of radio . So this film , while amusing , would probably have been as good with anyone else playing Ambrose C . Park ( the " C " is for " Central " - Ambrose was abandoned in Central Park ) than Skelton . For example Danny Kaye might have tried it out and done well ( possibly a musical number would have been added ) . But this means that the normal stunts and sight gags associated with Skelton's best films were not involved in this one ( except one memorable last one that I will always recall fondly ) . Interestingly enough , THE GREAT DIAMOND ROBBERY is very rarely shown on television anymore . I saw it in the early 1960s , when both Skelton and Cara Williams were prominent television stars . But memories of their work is not pushed these days ( surprisingly so with Skelton , who left a surprisingly sturdy body of film work ) . So if you catch a chance to see it , watch it . . . you may not have a second chance quickly afterward . Ambrose , a foundling , wants to find his real parents . He happens to be in an unusual profession - he is a highly skilled jewelry cutter . His second fondest wish is to tackle a peculiarly difficult jewel that has just been found . Potentially it is one of the great jewels , like the Culinor or the Hope Diamond , but it has to be cut just so to split in half . Otherwise it may as well be used in a road bed with gravel . So his bosses are arguing with him that he is not ready to do the diamond properly ( despite his showing them charts he has drawn after studying it and it's flaws ) . Ambrose is still searching for his parents , and while doing so meets an attorney Mr . Remlick ( James Whitmore , in an early performance ) . Remlick is also interested in this diamond . He happens to be working with some thieves who want to steal it . So Remlick finds Ambrose fascinating as both searcher and as diamond cutter . Remlick and his backers led by Uncle Tony ( Kurt Kazner ) " help " Ambrose find his " mother " Mrs . Drumman ( Dorothy Stickney ) and his " sister " Maggie ( Cara Williams ) . He is very happy about this situation , except he and Maggie find themselves looking at each other in non-sibling terms . That is becoming uncomfortable for both of them . The rest of the film follows the way the gang manipulate Ambrose into taking the jewel home to cut , to show his bosses off . Of course , once that is done - what to do with Ambrose ? Grim as it sounds , the film is amusing . But it had few of the typical bits that Skelton movies had , especially those he did with Buster Keaton . The one exception is the conclusion which I would like to think that Keaton had something to do with , for it's logic , and it's sweet symmetry . SO SPOILER COMING UP ( sorry ! ) : Ambrose does show up his bosses . His careful study of the stone enabled him to know exactly where the right spot to hit it was . So there are now two halves of the stone , perfectly cut , each about the size of a trimmed half of a fat pear . But Louis and his gang ( who have been chasing Ambrose and Maggie ) are pounding on the door of the room that he used to cut the stone . They have to hide the jewel or these thugs will take it . Then we see the police arrive and arrest Louis and his thugs , and Ambrose lets them in . He and Maggie are glad to be rescued and explained they protected the stone . How ? Well there was no place to hide it in that room , so each of them swallowed half the stone ! Really ? they are asked . Yes says Ambrose , and then his face shows a growing agony in his intestines , mirrored by a similar one in Maggie's . They are rushed to a hospital and taken into surgery on parallel gurneys . We see them coming out of their anesthetic fog at the same time , and both are presented with a look at their temporary " twin " babies ! Sweet little ending that .
493021	3280905	56957	6.0	An Unusual Ending For Sophia	This is not a great film , but it's enough of a curious film to merit watching . The story deals with a wife who loathes her husband ( Anthony Perkins ) and thinks him dead . If it is true she is well rid of him . It is not true , and he forces her to go through a life insurance swindle ( for a big paying policy on his life ) . In the course of the movie she meets an insurance investigator ( Gig Young ) who she would really feel good with . But she has to keep up the lie that Perkins is dead , and Young grows more suspicion . And the pressure of the lie , and meeting Perkins demands , and facing Young's questions is building up more and more on Loren . The conclusion ( which I will not reveal ) was a surprise for Loren fans , and remains the only time she ever did this in a movie - she goes mad .
492666	3280905	22402	6.0	Score another one from " You Tube " , but not as good as it could have been	This is another film where you get some kind of trivia question that seems unusual : Name the film that had a cast including Norma Shearer , Joan Crawford , Loretta Young , Barbara Stanwyck , Irene Dunne , Hedda Hopper , Fay Wray , Polly Moran , Maurice Chevalier , William Haines , Wallace Beery , Gary Cooper , Edward Robinson , Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , Frank Faye , Edmund Lowe , Victor McLaglen , Richard Dix , Richard Barthelmess , Charles Butterworth , Buster Keaton , Gabby Hayes , " Our Gang " , Mitzi Green , George E . Stone , Wheeler and Woolsey , El Brendel , Jack Oakie , Joe E . Brown , Laurel and Hardy , Eugene Palette , Stu Erwin , and Skeets Gallagher . It is THE STOLEN JOOLS ( also called THE SLIPPERY PEARLS ) . It was a specialty little film done for charity by Chesterfield Cigarettes in 1931 . It is a relatively minor comedy - and it is it's stars and some of the humor they bring to it , that make it worth watching today . A bit better planning about the material and maybe the film would be worth real revival on television or by movie societies . Plot Summary : Norma Shearer threw a big Hollywood party at her home for a charity , and during it her pearls were stolen . We learn it was Eddie Robinson and George E . Stone who stole them , but the pearls were stolen from the thieves . Robinson and Stone report the theft from them to a bemused Wallace Beery ( more interested in writing a film script than in pursuing criminals , despite being a police sergeant ) . He sends for Buster Keaton ( his assistant ) to get the police out . The investigator is Inspector ( Eddie ) Kane - who goes to the Shearer mansion with his two best men ( Stan and Ollie - whose car falls apart when they arrive ) . The rest of the film follows Kane's questioning all the prominent guests , with varying degrees of success due to their cleverness or density . The end result is Kane finds the stolen jewels when the party who took them from Robinson and Stone confesses . The film had vast potential , but like so many " let's stuff the film with stars " ideas , the appearance of the stars out stripped the actual result . Like those World War II all star war-effort films , the idea sounds appealing , but the results are less so . Laurel & Hardy ; Wheeler & Woolsey ; Beery ( with or without Robinson and Stone ) ; Stanwyck with her then husband Faye ( and Kane ) ; Irene Dunne ( all too briefly ) ; Palette , Erwin , Gallagher , and Cooper ; Our Gang , all have the best moments in the film . Kane ( a useful character actor , but nothing really special ) does happen to prove funny as the struggling detective . But the fact is that the material is so slap-dash it is not really memorable at all . Stan and Ollie drive Kane to Norma Shearer's mansion - and their car collapses . Kane asks them to wait for him . As he walks away , Ollie hits Stan on the shoulder and says , " Didn't I tell you not to be so fast on that last payment ? " Cute bit , but not one of their high points . Wheeler and Woolsey are in a diner watching Kane ( disguised as a counter man . They don't trust him , but Bert is unwilling to leave without a cup of coffee ( he is sitting in back of a mountain of empty coffee cups - the best sight gag in the film , and probably not noticed by most viewers ) . They end up in a slapping situation with Kane over remarks that Bert said that Robert told him to say . Kane finally asks if they've ever done this before . Woolsey says , " Yeah , in RIO RITA ! " . That happens to be the most interesting aspect of THE STOLEN JOOLS : the topical references to Hollywood in 1931 . William Haines is in a sequence as a friend of Joan Crawfords . Still a recognized leading man in 1931 , Haines retired soon after because he was coming out of the closet as a gay man , and would soon have a successful career with his boyfriend as interior decorators and furniture designers in Hollywood . Beery's involvement with Listening to robbers Robinson and Stone ( who , remember , actually did steal the pearls from Shearer ) is a reference to Robinson's first big role ( shared in many scenes with Stone ) in LITTLE CAESAR . George Sidney is with his film partner Charles Murray , who appeared as the warring heads of the mixed couple marriage in THE COHENS AND THE KELLY series . Mitzi Green was a popular young child actress in that period , and the " Our Gang " group includes Norman Chaney ( soon to be replaced by the better remembered Spanky MacFarlane . Lowe and McLaglen are with a female extra in a restaurant ( run by El Brendel as waiter ) and obviously dressed as Quirt and Flagg from their " What Price Glory ? " series - in fact McLaglen gets upset finding that Lowe went with the girl to Shearer's party the night before ! The soon to be over marriage of Frank Faye and Stanwyck is referred to as currently existing in their scene . By the way , Dunne and Stanwyck do the best comic performances of the regular stars among the females - Dunne describing the missing item , but claiming she never saw it , and Stanwyck reciting an awful poem she wrote , and getting rewarded by Kane ( with Faye's approval ) for reciting it . The best of the regular actors who appeared was probably Beery , who is barely concerned at news that Los Angeles is burning as he concentrates on his writing . Warner Baxter does a nice trip on his Cisco Kid performance flirting with his Spanish accent to Fifi D'Orsay with her French accent . When Kane demands of Baxter if he attended the Shearer party and danced , Baxter says , " Excuse me , I do not dance English ! " . It needed a major script rewrite - but it's best moments are cute enough .
491835	3280905	31996	6.0	The last moment was ridiculous	I am giving this film a " 6 " because of my fondness for Stephen Foster's melodies ( and my pity for his fate ) , and because - whatever one thinks of his racist " blackface " act , Al Jolson was a wonderful singer . If it had been shot as a concert film of Foster's best tunes , it would have been worth an " 9 " or even a " 10 " . Instead it is tied to one of those idiotic Hollywood composer biographies . It is a sub-set to Hollywood biographies , all of which have fact problems . Here it is trying to concentrate on Foster's alcoholism ( a fact ) , but not on the business problems he confronted in his career . Foster was the first American composer of lasting merit ( although his contemporary Louis Moreau Gottschalk came close ) . His compositions were totally composed by him ( including lyrics ) . But he never had any business abilities , so that while tunes like " Old Folks At Home " , " Beautiful Dreamer " , " The Camptown Races " , " I Dream of Jeannie " and " Oh Susannah " were massive popular hits , Foster got remarkably little of the profits . Added to his problems were the lack of efficient copy-write protection in the U . S . ( or on the globe , for that matter ) to prevent pirating of his work . He was also the first composer who tried to live on the successful profits of his compositions . Had he been frugal , and not a drinker , it just might have worked ( for a few years he did prosper ) , but he fumbled it . His last years were spent still composing , but living as a Bowery derelict . His end is not quite the melodrama of the film - he fell in his room cutting himself ( not cutting his throat ) . Due to his alcoholic condition weakening his body , he died a few days later in Bellevue Hospital . Don Ameche is a terrific actor , and does what he can here - but it reminds us of an extended development of his Edward Salomon ( Lillian Russell's doomed composer husband ) in the Russsell biography . He is talented - greatly so - but drink and ill health doom her here . No new extension of his acting range as Foster . By 1939 I wonder if there was increasing criticism by African - American groups regarding stereotyping in Hollywood . Probably not too much yet , or at least enough for the industry to take notice . Films about D . D . Emmett ( DIXIE ) , and other films with minstrel segments in them would still appear within the next decade . It really is not until the end of the 1940s and into the 1950s that an effect of World War II is felt - a dislike for the disparate treatment of African Americans - and begins to have an impact . So the minstrel portions , historically correct ( unfortunately ) , were totally acceptable in this film in 1939 . Oddly enough , given the accidental tragedy that ends this film , the fate of E . E . Christy is overlooked . Christy apparently had a nervous breakdown in the 1860s , and threw himself out of a window . One would not know that watching Jolson's performance , based on this script . The concluding moment of this film always stuck in my craw . Tragically announcing the death of Foster at what was supposed to be the benefit to resurrect his career , Christy / Jolson announces the first performance of Foster's latest and greatest tune . He starts singing " Old Folks At Home " ( renamed " Swanee River " - as in the film title ) , Jolson starts singing it ( remember for the first time ) . When the music reaches the chorus , " All the world is sad and weary . . . " the whole audience arose and sang it's chorus lines . Remarkable example of massive psychic transference , or poor screenplay writing : I leave it to the viewer to guess which .
492395	3280905	81229	6.0	Chewbaca's Cousin in the Oregon Woods ?	When a horror film is done properly it grips the imagination ( and secret dread ) of the viewers , so that they admire the end result despite the fears it has resurrected . A good horror film can achieve these results even with the barest of film budgets ( such as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a decade ago ) . One marvels at one of the most effective moments in that film - when the female is all alone in that spooky , haunted , deadly wood at night , in her tent , speaking into the video machine's recorder and holding a flashlight to her face showing the strain her isolation has left her in . The thought for that effect must have been considerable , but the expense was minimal . And it remains in our memory as effective . NIGHT OF THE DEMON shares a similar sounding title to the American release title THE NIGHT OF THE DEMON , which was known in England as CURSE OF THE DEMON , and is one of the best horror films of the 1950s . NIGHT OF THE DEMON is an attempt to build a horror film about the question of the existence of " Big Foot " , the American " Abominable Snowman " that supposedly exists in the forests of Oregon and Washington . Tall and furry with reddish hair , " Big Foot " usually is supposed to look a little like Chewbaca in the STAR WARS films . Whether or not " Big Foot " really exists is an issue I am not prepared to discuss . The creature has appeared in other films , probably most notably the comedy HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS . Here the story is about how a group of students accompany a professor on an anthropology trek into the north-woods to see if they can find the creature . The students are made aware of the history ( as it is ) of " Big Foot " , where he supposedly came from , whom has he terrorized and killed . We see how his father creature raped his mother ( a farm-girl that was thrown out by her fanatical father ) , and how the father shot and killed the father of " Big Foot " after the rape . Eventually they do meet the creature in a deserted cabin , only to be destroyed by him ( only the badly burned professor survives the encounter . It is the professor that is telling the story of the creature's crimes . One is , of course , listening to his retelling these tales , of lovers being butchered , or wanderers being killed , wondering why anyone would seek to meet such a creature at all . It vaguely reminds one of the old cliché from the Universal Horror cycle films of the 1930s that there were some areas of knowledge mankind should not delve into . The film has memorable sequences . It does give pure shock value - most notably when a motorcyclist taking a pee by the side of the road gets his penis ripped off by " Big Foot " as a result . What I find fascinating is that the shock value of this and some other really awful moments are treated as so funny by many viewers . Somehow total amputation of a sex organ is hardly humorous . Nor is the use of a person's large intestine as a whip like devise to attack other people with . But both sequences stick to the memory even if they certainly go beyond the point of good taste . A better effect is the murder of a young couple in a van having sex , particularly as the bloodied corpse of the young man is slowly dropped from the vehicle's roof . I will give the film's creators their due in the use of music that lulls the viewer into a sense of false security , and some effects in the film ( making the lens seem to be a green and red tinted eyeball at times ) . For it's strengths I willingly give the film a . But the graphic nature of some of the effects make it less enjoyable to most viewers ( I think ) than other horror films are . One sequence that I watched I will try to correct a small error in the descriptions that are given of it . Two young women are mentioned by as having been probably killed by the monster . We see what happened : they are shown walking together when they start running from " Big Foot " , who catches them . They are stabbed to death . Now the sequence has been dismissed as another silly joke by some viewers . Reason : the girls are holding knives when they are walking through the woods , and continue holding them when they are running from the monster , and when caught . So that " Big Foot " ( according to one reviewer ) does a crazy " Hoky Koky " dance causing the two girls to stab each other to death by pushing them into each other . This is criticized as being stupid because the girls should just drop their knives . The two young women are scout leaders , and they are holding the knives because they are protecting themselves in that dense wood . The appearance of the monster causes them to get flustered , and ( even before " Big Foot " reaches them ) bump into each other while holding their weapons ( though without wounding each other ) . They don't drop the knives because they still rely on these weapons to help protect them . In doubling back to escape they run into " Big Foot " , who grabs them by the arms they hold the knives in - AT THE WRISTS ! They can't drop the knives . He then keeps knocking the two into each other's arms ( severing blood vessels in those limbs ) and then forces the girl's hands into each other's chests and necks . We watch them both gradually get fully bloodied by each other , until they both die from blood loss . It is a rather grim sequence - hardly funny at all .
492696	3280905	215598	7.0	The Beauties of the " Golden Gate " City	Another of the easy-to-take Fitzpatrick travelogues . This one I find most interesting in it's second half . The film has the great photography and film stock that we expect from Fitzpatrick , as he tells the story of the city of San Francisco from it's first appearance as a mission in 1769 to the modern day of 1940 . The Oakland Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge are both shown . So is the only building left over from the 1915 World's Fair . Then it concentrates on the Treasure Island World's Fair of 1939-40 , and the cavalcade of American Expansion showing such events as the pioneers in their cover wagons , the Wells Fargo Stagecoachs , the laying of the Golden Spike at Promintory Point , Utah in 1869 , and San Francisco in the gay 1890s . As a record of a long forgotten World's Fair attraction it is fascinating to look at . Oddly though , the most famous event in the city's history is not mentioned : it's determined rebuilding after the 1906 earthquake and fire . But then earthquakes are not good for tourism , and this travelogue was to encourage tourism .
492122	3280905	30631	7.0	A Nice , Forgettable Little Comedy	I recall that for many years this was the only one of Harold Lloyd's movies that occasionally turned up on screen in New York City . It is a passably funny film about an archaeologist who falls for the daughter of a tycoon and finds himself fighting the forces of Wall Street and fate itself to get the young lady . Lloyd's character is trying to fight an apparent curse from the tomb that he opened . The film literally goes to it's conclusion before the viewers learn if the curse will or will not work . Lloyd is ably supported in the film by Raymond Walburn , William Frawley , Lionel Stander , and Thurston Hall . Phyllis Welch was the young woman Lloyd pursues . She did nicely in the role , but not spectacularly . Her career soon faded from sight . Of the sound films made by Lloyd , " Professor Beware " usually is near the bottom . It is better ( in my opinion ) than " Welcome Danger " or " Feet First " , but it falls below the other four sound films . The problem with it is that it lacks any relationship to the type of film identified with Lloyd at his peak . It's situation comedy plot could have been done by most other comedians or leading men of the day . But it is not a total failure , and is worth watching .
493322	3280905	592466	7.0	The Events Leading to a Tragedy , August 1876	James Butler Hickok made himself one of the great Western legends of his time , first as an ace Pony Express rider , than as a scout for the Union Armies in the Civil War , then as a gunslinger turned lawman ( the Marshall of Abilene , Kansas ) . He was a remarkably fast draw - there is a story ( it's hard to tell how true it is ) that when he was Marshall , both John Wesley Hardin and Ben Thompson were in Abiline drinking together , and considering confronting Hickok to see who was faster . If the story is true , neither Hardin nor Thompson was willing to confront Hickok , after he managed to demonstrate ( peacefully ) how much quicker he was on throwing their preparatory movements towards grabbing their guns than they expected . But by 1869 Hickok was out of the gunfighter trade , and shortly moved east to New York City . This episode of THE GREAT ADVENTURE starred Lloyd Brides as Hickok , and explained what it was that made him lose his interest in his gunfighting career at it's peak . It turned out to be a combination of two factors . In one of the most notorious actions of his career as Marshall , Hickok ( while checking out an area for some criminals ) , thought he heard one of them behind him , rapidly turned around and fired , and killed the man who was behind him . Unfortunately it happened to be his deputy , who was also a close personal friend . The other thing was that Hickok's powers were ebbing . Always a keen-sighted man , his eyesight was failing . So this episode , after spending twenty minutes showing the Hickok of frontier legend , turned to the guilt-ridden man struggling to preserve his sight with eyeglasses . Bridges did a good job as Hickok , but it is the scene of him in the East , reading in a parlor with a pair of spectacles on that always remained on my mind . He could not stand the East . Unlike his old friend Bill Cody , Hickok felt constrained in the East . So in 1876 , hearing of the gold discoveries in the Black Hills , Hickok left his wife and headed for the town of Deadwood in the Dakota territory . He had set himself up there , when he was shot to death from behind by Jack McCall , a young desperado who wanted to make a reputation for himself as a gunslinger . Hickok was playing cards at the time . Traditionally he held a pair of aces and a pair of eights in his poker hand - what has since become known as " the Deadman's hand " .
493151	3280905	556803	7.0	The Symbol of the Cowboy	I was never a total fan of DEATH VALLEY DAYS , most of which episodes were on television in the period when I was growing up . By the time of this episode in 1962 I was eight , and I watched it for a reason unconnected to liking westerns . The star of the episode was Alan Young , the comedian who was currently appearing on television as " Wilbur Post " on MR . ED . Here he was playing the central figure of a biographical episode , Mr . John Stetson . He does a good job , assisted by Lee Van Cleef . The name is familiar to this day . Stetson was an easterner involved in the fur and pelt trade , who went to Colorado for his health . He had a lung problem , and was told the climate out west would help him out . The episode told how the tenderfoot was trying to find what he could do in the west , and accidentally stumbled into wealth and immortality . He knew ( from his work as a furrier ) how to make a hat . Usually a complex series of steps requiring various metal blocking devices are required . Stetson figured out a way of speeding it out and making the crown of the cowboy hat far more soft and flexible than the corresponding crowns in " civilized " area hats . We see him demonstrate to the cowboy who is with him ( Lee Van Cleef ) what can be done for a quick , useful , range hat . And he is soon convinced to make other cowboys similar hats . And the rest is history . To this day , ask for the name associated with hats , and " Stetson " comes up . Of course the firm eventually went into other styles of hats as well , but the romance of the name in hat lore remains what the old prospector says at the end - that a cowboy is known by his " Stetson " hat .
493267	3280905	68152	7.0	Ah , those wonderful German / Swiss Banks	This film was made in 1970-71 , just as Americans were becoming aware that the great period of economic advantage over our adversaries from World War II was coming to an end . Banks in Germany and Switzerland were attracting attention because they were convenient for money laundering purposes ( although that term was not fully in use yet ) . They offered security and confidentiality , which American Banks could not compete with . Gert Frobe is the head of the bank in the story ( somewhat ironic , as his best role was as Auric Goldfinger , who also threatened the American economy in a different way ) . Frobe is playing his hard working banker as a good natured , somewhat naive type . His right hand man is a security expert played by Warren Beatty . Beatty has learned that there are several people who are using the bank : a bunch of crooked G . I . s led by Scott Brady ; a mob lawyer ( Robert Webber ) and his assistant who are transporting tens of thousands of dollars to the bank ; a hired assassin and drug courier . All three groups have one common denominator : Goldie Hawn has been having sex with Brady , Webber , and the assassin . The three groups have used the banks super-protected safety deposit boxes to store their cash . Beatty has set up the cameras , so he is aware of the timing of the cameras as they move . If he can get locked into the vault under reasonably acceptable circumstances , he can also control his movements so as not to be photographed by the camera . He is also in a position to have duplicates for the three security boxes he would have to open . Once this is done , he could clear out the money in bags put into Golde Hawn's box , and she can come in the next day and pick them up . It sounds complicated . It is complicated , but Beatty and Hawn pull it off based on the knowledge of how much each group will deposit on a given weekend , and on the known nervousness of Frobe for the security of his beloved bank . The first half hour shows how the scheme got laid out , the next twenty minutes show how Beatty and Hawn ( especially Beatty in the locked vault ) pull it off . But the film does not end then . The three sets of individuals discover the robbery after the fact , and then Brady and the assassin discover the common denominator : Hawn . And the last forty minutes is a protracted chase through Germany , that has one great set piece of Beatty's fight for his life on a frozen lake . It is not a great film , but it is entertaining and ( at times ) comic , thanks mostly to Hawn and Frobe ( with some help from Brady occasionally ) . So I give it a " 7 " out of " 10 " .
491654	3280905	68108	7.0	The First " Masterpiece Theatre " " Who Dunnit ? "	I have had mixed feelings about this series since I first saw it in the early 1970s . I read THE MOONSTONES in the late 1960s , and enjoyed Wilkie Collin's blending of a detective story with his social comments about Victorian hypocrisy and hypocrites . It was the first Collins ' novel I read ( THE WOMAN IN WHITE followed within two years ) . Then I heard that it was going to be on " Masterpiece Theatre " . It excited me to see that two of the stars of THE FORSYTE SAGA were in it ( Martin Jarvis and John Welsh ) , and I looked forward to it . Alistaire Cooke's introduction was also increasing my expectations . He pointed out it was the first " Who Dunnit " on " Masterpiece Theatre " . The series did tell the story of the novel , but I found it disappointing . Not that the acting and production was poor , but they did not follow the organization of the novel as Collins thought it out . Collins had different characters in the novel tell the story in overlapping manner ( like Welles and Mankiewicz did in the screenplay for CITIZEN KANE ) so that we got different perspectives on the actions and on the characters . This was jettisoned : so we missed the character of Miss Clack , and her self-serving religiosity , and barely got Gabriel Betteridge's love of using Defoe's ROBINSON CRUSOE as a source of philosophy . If you have read THE MOONSTONES you can tell this is a serious loss . The plot of the novel is simple . Rachel Verrinder ( Vivien Heilbron ) is celebrating her coming of age birthday , and her mother Lady Verrinder ( Kathleen Byron ) is having a party for her , to which is invited some of the friends and young beaus interested in her . In particular Franklin Blake ( Robin Ellis ) and Godfrey Ablewhite ( Martin Jarvis ) . The household plans are aided by Lady Verrinder's butler Gabriel Betteridge ( Basil Dignam ) . But as the festivities are about to begin , a testamentary gift is sent to the house that Lady Verrinder is not too happy about . Her ladyship's uncle had been kept at arm's length since her childhood by the family - he gained a fortune by unscrupulous methods ( including violence and murder ) in a " battle " in India in 1799 at Seringapatam . The uncle felt the universal dislike , and became reclusive . Now he sends ( in his will ) a very valuable jewel : The Moonstone , possibly the rarest diamond in the world . It is his gift to his unseen grand niece , and , yet , Lady Verrinder has forebodings that it is pure evil . Soon it seems to be attracting unease among everyone . Three mysterious Indians show up in the English countryside for no reason , and keep approaching the house . Rachel is favoring Franklin as a possible fiancé over Godfrey , but they have a quarrel . Then the diamond vanishes . The local police come in and are totally inept , especially as they tend to dismiss the investigation they should be conducting when Lady Verrinder orders it . A servant girl with a past named Roseanna Spearman ( Anna Cropper ) attracts some attention , but nothing is accomplished . Public opinion insists on action , and Scotland Yard sends it's best detective , Sergeant Cuff ( John Welsh ) . Immediately the investigation starts getting really serious . Cuff does not care who is shielding who , or whether the parties involved are nobility and gentry or not . He goes out of his way to solve the case . Soon he is aware that Lady Verrinder's interference is due to the behavior of Rachel , and that Rachel's seems pegged on her feelings about Franklin . Still he is also aware of the odd behavior of Spearman , who he tries to question ( and who keeps putting him off ) . Ablewhite also leaves rather early , as did several other guests . The fact that a nightgown is missing that is a vital clue is bothering him . He appears to be approaching a solution , when Spearman commits suicide . The local police Superintendent Foley causes a backlash , forcing Cuff to be recalled . And the case is left unresolved , until two years pass . And I will leave it at that . When Collins wrote the novel in 1868 he was using elements from several recent events . One was the Road Murder Mystery of 1860 . If you have seen the complete version of DEAD OF NIGHT , you see part of that story when Sally Ann Howes meets the little boy ghost . This is the murder of Francis Saville Kent , possibly by his half-sister Constance Kent . A leading clue in that case was a missing nightgown belonging to Constance . The detective on the case was Inspector Jonathan Whicher , got recalled when local opinion swerved against him after he began suspecting Constance . He was recalled , and like Cuff was forced to resign ( and like Cuff was subsequently vindicated to see his suspicions proved apparently true ) . Professor Richard Altick also found that a later incident in the story was based on an 1864 crime , " the Northumberland Street outrage " , involving waylaying a person into a house . The performances were good though , despite the change of the novel's story-making structure . Welch's Cuff was perhaps too restrained ( the novel pushes his habit of growing roses and humming " The Last Rose of Summer " ) . Robin Ellis was on the edge of television stardom ( POLDARK was in the future ) but he gave a good performance as Franklin , who finds the discovery of the truth more upsetting than he bargained for . Cropper's Spearman was very sympathetic , as the cursed jewel's unexpected victim . The show was , if not all it should have been , a good dramatization .
491614	3280905	72482	7.0	Good Series based on Maugham's novel about hypocrisy and literary fame	CAKES AND ALE is a title based on a line from Shakespeare's TWELFTH NIGHT . At one point , Sir Toby Belch is tired at the Puritan hypocrite Malvolio , who is quite the spoilsport regarding Sir Toby and his antics with the maid Maria and his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek . " Just because thou art virtuous shall there be no cakes and ale ! " , he throws out at Malvolio . The quote is the basis for the thrust of this novel . We glorify people in the world as great figures , and there are those around them that build them into demigod like figures . But they were humans actually , and they had failures and foibles . To fully appreciate their success and greatness we should know what they were really like - but there are those hangers on who ( like Malvolio ) will deny the human element in order to shine up the fame in the hope of catching some of it themselves . Somerset Maugham , with his delicious sense of irony , looks at the effects in the literary world of the death of that grand old man of letters Edward Driffield . Maugham's narrator is William Ashenden ( his alter ego - he already appeared in ASHENDEN , Maugham's fictional account of his secret service work in World War I , which became Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT ) . Ashenden is a novelist , and as a boy knew the younger Driffield . He also knew Driffield's first wife , Rosie , who was a live wire . But few people know of Rosie Dawn Driffield . You see , she was . . . well relatively common . A fun loving woman , and a barmaid , she lacks a certain surface quiet and elegance one associates with grand old men of literature . Such is the opinions of the second Mrs . Driffield ( formerly Driffield's nurse - who felt it an honor to take care of Mr . Driffield in his dotage ) , and the noted novelist Alroy Kear . Kear has turned himself into the Malvolio of the story - protecting ( with the second Mrs . Driffield ) the glory and reputation of Driffield , while hoping that the public will see Kear as the successor as grand old man of English letters to the deceased . Maugham's novel was redone in Britain in this series from 1974 , with Michael Hordern as the older Ashenden , and Judy Cornwell ( who later played Daisy on KEEPING UP APPEARANCES ) as Rosie . The introductions by Alistair Cooke ( when the show was shown on " Masterpiece Theatre " explained that the spoof on high literature and reputation was based on Maugham's views of two major British writers of the twentieth century . One was Thomas Hardy , the great , late Victorian novelist and poet who was recognized as the " grand old man of English letters " at the time of his death in 1928 . Hardy had been married in his youth to a pretty local woman , who eventually left him . He remarried in later years , but the second Mrs . Hardy was not quite the harpy that the second Mrs . Driffield was . The second Mrs . Hardy died in the late 1930s . And Alroy Kear was the novelist Hugh Walpole , best remembered today for ROGUE HERRIES and MR . PERRIN AND MR . TRAIL ( the latter made into a movie in the 1940s ) . Maugham felt Walpole a lightweight , pretentious man , and was merciless in his depiction of him as the ambitious , empty Kear . In fact , the spoof probably had an unfair effect on Walpole's literary reputation to this day . The series shows how Kear is trying to get the rights to write the definitive biography of Driffield , and the second lady is giving him her full cooperation . But Ashenden is aware that they are making the man a bloodless monument , and he knew Driffield as a decent , hard drinking fellow . And he ( as young Willie Ashenden - Paul Ashdon ) knew Rosie , the fun loving barmaid who married Driffield , had a small affair with young Willie , and suffered a tragedy with her husband - the loss of their only child . Typical of Driffield , he used the death as material for a novel . Eventually she abandoned Driffield with another lover , and Ashenden eventually finds her living happily in America . But will he or won't he reveal the truth of Driffield's first marriage to the world , and destroy Kear's bogus biography ? That is not resolved until the last episode . It was a well acted and directed version of the novel , but the commentary by Cooke helped explain the background of the story . Hordern was obviously enjoying his role , as when he suggests to a queasy Kear , at one point , that the smell of sweat on a working man may actually be a sexual turn on for a woman . That is the sort of detail Kear would never use in his novels or the biography of Driffield .
493150	3280905	556756	7.0	The Bet That Created a Future Industry	Although I did not watch DEATH VALLEY DAYS too frequently there were two episodes I recall because of the historical figures involved in them . One was the episode with Alan Young about John Stetson and his hats . The other is this episode which settled one of the great mysteries of the animal kingdom and created the name and reputation of one of America's best remembered photographers - and began a thread that helped lead to the development of an industry now centered in California . Hedley Mattingly ( later remembered as District Officer Hedley on DAKTARI ) plays the photographer . He is at a local race course one day with his wife , a family acquaintance , and several important figures including California's governor ( it is 1873 ) Leland Stanford ( Harry Holcombe ) . Holcombe is watching his horse race a friends , and they start discussing the beauty of the animals , and the grace with which the horses go around the track . Stanford wondered if the horses ever had all four hoofs off the ground at the same time . His friend says he did not think it was possible : horses require two of their legs to be on the ground at one point of time while the others rise . It is necessary for their balance . But Stanford felt it was possible . He had run , and occasionally both of his legs were off the ground . Why not a horse . But how to find out ? It was decided after the wager on this problem ( $25 , 000 . 00 - a big sum of money now but more so then ) to have the photographer try to photograph a horse in gallop . He was appalled at this assignment , but agreed to do it . After all , Stanford was the Governor of California . The story follows the photographer's experiments with cameras , and the false ends many ideas lead to . But there is a second story told ( though from what I recall bowdlerized ) . The photographer's wife Flora ( Diane Brewster ) , was having an affair with a family acquaintance David Neal ( Lew Brown ) . This comes to the photographer's attention , and complicates his search for an answer to the question . In the end the photographer set up cameras worked by trip wires all over the race course . Stanford's horse ran down the course , and all the pictures were developed . And sure enough they showed the horse does have all four hoofs off the ground when the horse is galloping . Stanford won the bet . To prove that the pictures were not doctored , the photographer created a machine that flicked their images on a screen in order to show the horse in gallop down the track . The device , a zoopraxiscope ( I believe that is how it is spelled ) was the world's first motion picture camera . Stanford congratulates the photographer , who was Eadward Muybridge , and said he showed that pictures could be made to move . The romance also was ended , but in the episode I don't think they went into how it was ended . Muybridge is unique - he is remembered for his remarkable slow motion studies of men and animals , and he is recalled as one of the fathers of motion pictures ( Edison , while working on his camera in the 1890s , met with Muybridge to check out his " rival " only to find that Muybridge had no further desire to develop motion pictures ) . But Muybridge is also one of the few actual killers honored by the U . S . Government by a postage stamp . You see , he killed his wife's lover ( as Congressman Daniel E . Sickels did in 1859 ) . And like Sickels he was acquitted by the notorious " unwritten law " about killing adulterers threatening one's marriage . That part I don't recall was in the episode - Muybridge's violent act occurred shortly after the bet was settled . Aside from that odd postscript the episode kept to the story quite well . And it was memorable enough to remain on this viewer's mind some forty years after seeing it .
492511	3280905	23800	7.0	One bad tempered gorilla	This has it's moments as an early Pre-code Betty Boop . On Halloween a scarecrow finds a printed invitation to Betty's house for a party . He shows up , and after warming himself he assists her in setting up her home . Like most of the plots of Fleischer's cartoons , the initial structure is jettisoned for new incidents and characters to take over . The last we see of the Scarecrow is his putting up wall pictures of witches and black cats from special paint cans labeled " witch paint " and " cat paint " . He flicks these on the walls , and the witches appear on brooms while the cats appear with their backs humped up . Betty is shown coring pumpkins ( actually a cat descends with a device to do the coring , but Betty acts tired after each one is cored ) . Soon the guests arrive , and we see them bobbing for apples - one gets knocked out by an apple he is supposed to catch with his teeth . Then , about two thirds of the way through the cartoon , we see a gorilla arrive . YOU TUBE suggests that this particular cartoon was taken off the television shows of the 1950s and 1960s because it is a racial stereotype ( presumably for African - Americans ) , but it does need stretching to see that . The idea of a gorilla as a symbol for a Black male is an old one , but this gorilla has nothing suggestive of what racial stereotyping would suggest . It just is a bullying gorilla , who first hits a tree ( hurting a behind that suddenly appears ) , and blackening the eyes of a inoffensive owl . He then sees the party , and appropriates all the apples in a bobbing for apples . But soon he is being pursued by goblins and witches , apparently directed at him by a mysterious big cat . He is eventually chased out of the party , to the happiness of the other guests . But was that supposed to suggest the stereotypical superstition associated with male African-Americans too ? I still find it quite a stretch . It is not a bad cartoon , but not one of the best efforts by Fleischer's studio .
492272	3280905	604413	7.0	A Story Based On Truth	This episode of HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET was odd because it had been based on a true story that went the rounds between 1994 and 1998 . Steve Allan and Jayne Meadows are a married couple who always seem to be arguing and then go through a ritual when the argument gets very hot : Allan goes to a closet and pulls out his shotgun , and aims it at Meadows , firing it ( there is no charge in it ) . Meadows falls , pretending she is killed , and Allan rushes over to her to apologize to her before she " dies " . So all is forgiven about their crazy weekly quarrel . But one day when they go through the entire formula , Meadows stumbles just as Allan fires the supposedly empty gun . Only this time the gun fires a charge , but since Meadows has hit the ground before it was fired , Allan's shot goes through the window . But just at that moment a man is falling from the roof , and he gets the shot through him - killing him ! . The police come and arrest a shaken Allan . He can't understand how the gun was loaded - he never loads it ! The police are appalled by the weird circumstances here . Is it an attempted murder of Meadows ? Is it a murder with depraved indifference or a manslaughter of the man who was shot and killed ? And who is he - there was no identification on the body . The A . D . A . is talking shop with her friends and those police not in on the case . And it gradually unravels . First , the man who was shot was definitely an attempted suicide - he was seen carefully going to the roof , and purposely jumping off . So does that lessen the fault of Allan . Possibly , but Allan still was going through the intentional motions of threatening to fire and kill a target ( Meadows ) even though he hit a second target . Yes , they are aware that Allan was claiming that he did not load the gun , but he could be lying . Then it turns out that earlier in the day Allan and Meadow's son was visiting them , and that he was arguing about them lending him some money he needed for his business . They refused because he had lost all the money they lent him earlier . He was aware of their weekly argument game , and he was alone in the room with the weapon for a few minutes . He knew how to load the gun . Possibly he loaded it . His fingerprint is on the gun . They should speak to him . That's just it - he's vanished . Has he fled ? Gradually , however , it all falls into place . After checking the possible places that the son could have fled to , someone notices the fingerprint does look familiar . It looks like the fingerprint of the suicide . They check , and now they know the son jumped off the roof . So now , instead of an attempted murder of Meadows , Allan can be tried for the murder of the son . . . or can he ? The son loaded the rifle . The son's finances were messed up . He threatened to have his parents committed if they did not help him , or , to commit suicide . The A . D . A . explains that the son loaded the rifle , intending his father would kill the mother , and go to prison , Then he went to the roof to jump off and kill himself . He just did not realize the rifle he loaded would be fired and kill him instead . So Allan is not arrested - it is , after all , suicide . The story actually happened , not in Baltimore ( where HOMICIDE took place in ) but in another part of the country in March 1994 . The plotter was one Ronald Opus , and the story was told by Dr . Don Harper Mills at the 1994 annual awards dinner for Forensic Science , AAFS
491894	3280905	359596	7.0	Pete Smith makes a turkey out of a Foodlebean	Pete Smith's shorts are usually amusing - occasionally they are really funny ( particularly the ones starring Dave O'Brien - best remembered for being turned into a homicidal maniac in REEFER MADNESS ) . Smith's delivery is a little bit a trial after awhile - he had this nasal voice which made him sound like a wise-guy ( a vocal habit that is shared by one newsman in the New York Metropolitan area at least ) . However , the situations are usually clever and fairly simple . Here it is how to properly cut a turkey at Thanksgiving or any other occasion . First we see an expert who does a lovely job at carving a turkey , turning it on it's side and then carefully , studiously , carving it in a scientific manner ( for example , removing bones that are impediments to carving , and also shaving succulent slices off legs and wings ) . After five minutes of watching this , we watch a newlywed couple cooking and cutting a giant turkey for the wife's brother , sister-in-law , and nephew ( " Little Otto " - played by " Butch " from the " Our Gang " comedies ) . It is obvious that the three in-laws have little use for the newlywed husband ( " Mr . Foodlebean " ) , and are hostile just looking at him . All three watch as he wrecks the turkey , and the stuffing , and knocks bottles over - well you get the picture . He lives down to their expectations . If not as funny as the ones with O'Brien , this one certainly has some nice moments of growing frustrations ( and one moment dealing with the stuffing and " Butch's " face that is priceless - for a change his nasty looking expressions are merited ! ) Certainly an amusing , trifling comedy .
492374	3280905	39242	7.0	" You Will Shun Him . "	Captain Charles Cunningham Boycott is one of those figures in history who by their careers or actions actually contributed to our language - usually without thinking about it . Lord Cardigan , who led the charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War , wore a tight sweater which still bears his name . Lord Brougham , the great lawyer and Lord Chancelor , had a special carriage designed for him , which is named for him . William Burke ( with his partner William Hare ) suffocated a dozen people to sell their bodies to Dr . Robert Knox , the anatomist . The method of suffocation is still called " burking " . Reverend Spooner's weird confusion of letters and syllables is still called a " spoonerism " . The edited censorship of literary masterpieces is called bowdlerizing after Bowdler the originator of the censorship . Captain Boycott is remembered for not what he did or wore or said . He is recalled for what was done to him because of his behavior to others . In 1878 the lower classes in Ireland began a series of acts of violence against landlords , especially Protestant landlords . The reasons were connected with unfairly high rents and misuse of economic power to force people to do what their landlords wanted them to do . The worst incidents resulted in the murders of landlords ( Lord Leitrim in 1878 , Lord Mountmorres in 1880 ) and Mr . Walter Bourke ( an agent for a landlord ) in 1882 . Boycott was a rather heavy handed landowner , who threw out tenants who did not do what he wanted ( including voting for Tory candidates ) . He became targeted for punishment , but what happened turned out to be more effective and less bloody than what happened to Leitrim , Mountmorres , and Bourke . On the advice of cooler heads than armed terrorists , such as political leader Charles Stewart Parnell , it was advised to socially and emotionally ostracize Boycott . Instead of threatening his possession of his estate ( which would allow him to call in British troops ) the locals would not sell him needed food or supplies , nor do work on his estate , nor even talk to him and his staff . This ostracism ( now called " boycotting " ) proved very effective - it led to Boycott , after nearly half a year's struggle , to give up his estate and leave Ireland forever . The movie basically tells the story , with Cecil Parker actually playing the central role of Captain Boycott . Parker plays one of his rare negative characters , but he has moments of typical befuddled Parker humor ( when talking to a friend about the unwanted London reporters in his home following the ostracism campaign , he notes the reporter for the TIMES appears to be drunk under his dinner table - we see the man's legs ) . Since he is the villain actually ( with Mervyn Johns as his sneaky estate agent ably assisting him ) , we look elsewhere for our hero . Here it is Stewart Granger , as an independent minded tenant of Boycott's , whose prize race horse excites the Captain's greed . But Granger is also a voice of reason . Although he doesn't care for Parnell ( he mentions rumors about Parnell's sex life ) , he hears the great man give a speech advocating peaceful protest rather than violence . This is how the campaign against Boycott begins . Alistair Sim plays the local Catholic pastor , who also counsels peaceful protest . Noel Purcell plays an interesting semi-villain - the local schoolteacher who is an accomplished agitator ( for violence ) . And playing Parnell for one scene only is Robert Donat , who gives the great man's speech his normal eloquence , and actually looks like Parnell ( unlike Clark Gable in the 1939 biographical fiasco from Hollywood ) . A little stiff at times , it is ( on the whole ) a wonderful example of a good historical movie . As such I recommend catching it when you can .
492836	3280905	33606	7.0	Possibly the Best film set in old New Orleans	This is not a great film but it is entertaining and frothy . Rene Clair , like Jean Renoir , fled France for the United States and made movies in Hollywood . But Renoir concentrated on serious films , like " This Land is Mine " and " The Southerner " . Clair made comedies , of which this and " I Married a Witch " were the best ones . In " Flame of New Orleans " Clare tackled a sex romp in the Big Easy of the 1840s . He succeeds in capturing the charm of the great town , and ( with maybe one or two exceptions ) produced the best film about New Orleans and it's Gallic flavor . Marlene Dietrich is an international adventuress ( we subsequently realize she has been as far from New Orleans as St . Petersburg , Russia ) . She is as sexually alluring as ever , and has got the pleasant attention of Roland Young a rich banker . While Young woos her she also attracts the attention of ship captain Bruce Cabot , who is more to her taste in form , but not in terms of money . She plays her game with Cabot and gets him into debt . Meanwhile she pursues a willing Young , only to first find a number of men who knew her in the past , and then find that Cabot is getting into her hair . So she tries to create a twin cousin situation . But this complicates the situation even more . The character actors like Mischa Auer ( frantically trying to retrieve his top hat before he gets challenged to a duel ) , or Melville Cooper ( cornered by his loveless marriage wife , and ending up being unexpectedly blunt ) , or even Shemp Howard ( who has the freshest wine cellar in New Orleans ) have excellent moments to shine in this film's comedy . It is a marvelously funny confection which I recommend
492101	3280905	39819	7.0	The Suffrage Movement : 1875 - Boston	Because of the prominence of the abolition movement in the 1830s - 1860s , other American social movements of the day are not thought of very much . If you are interested , read Tyler's book FREEDOM'S FERMENT , which discusses the international peace movement , woman's rights , and other movements of equal interest in that period - only these did not lead to Civil War . The woman's suffrage movement had begun in 1848 in upstate New York , but it really does not get the momentum that made it memorable until the 1870s . Then Susan B . Anthony goes on trial ( also in New York State ) for daring to try to vote in a national election . Also Victoria Woodhull throws her hat into the ring ( unofficially ) for the Presidency in 1872 . Later Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organize the woman's movement , so that after they both die in the early 1900s it grows until it achieves suffrage by Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1919 . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is not the only film to tackle early woman's suffrage . There is a bit about the movement in the character of Miss Massingale in THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL , who keeps confronting ( and romancing ) Burt Lancaster's army Colonel . But THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is actually the only film from that looks at the movement at a critical moment in it's history . A little background is needed here . In the early days of the women's suffrage movement , there was considerable debate regarding allying the movement with other social movements of the day . However , Anthony and Stanton were convinced by Frederick Douglass to work for abolition , because if slavery was abolished ( Douglas argued ) woman's servitude would have to follow soon after . But in the post-Civil War years , the relationship between Douglass and the suffrage leadership soured . Douglass , once the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments got passed , was more concerned about African American ( read African-American males ) consolidating and expanding their gains . He started to curb joint efforts with Stanton and Anthony on woman's rights , claiming that it just was not the time ( although his previous argument had been to strike when the fire was hot ! ) . Anthony and Stanton eventually over-reacted . They never forgave the betrayal by Douglass , and soon they managed to make the woman's suffrage movement lily white ( and rather racist towards the former male slaves who now - theoretically - could vote ) . A small African-American woman's suffrage movement pushed forward too , but it was fighting antagonism by male African-Americans , and racism by white women who should have been their sisters in arms . The lesson though was now burned into the heads of the woman's movement - don't ally yourself with other causes . And , interestingly enough , this is the center for part of the plot of THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM . Betty Grable tries to keep her friends from allying themselves with another social movement which grew with woman's suffrage - Prohibition . She is unable to do so . In the decades from 1870 - 1920 many woman suffrage figures , like Carrie Nation , were also outspoken supporters of prohibition . These women ( like Nation ) had homes that had been wrecked by alcoholic husbands , so their stand and unity with Prohibitionists made sense . But the bulk of the woman's movement avoided this , because they did not want their political agenda tainted by a rival one . The same situation happened in the English suffrage movement too , when Mrs . Pankhurst's daughters split on allying with the British Labor Party , and the anti-war movement . Sylvia Pankhurst remained united with Labor leader and pacifist Keir Hardie , but her sister Cristobel was clever enough to offer to support the war effort in return for Asquith and Lloyd George's support for woman's voting rights . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM has several things working for it . The two leads had a good story . Dick Haymes was actually better in this film as the hero who learns to respect working women , than he was as the son in STATE FAIR . Grable actually had a role in a musical that did not begin and end with her gorgeous legs , and moderately pleasing singing voice - it is her meatiest musical role . The Gershwin score is minor Gershwin , but still enjoyable . Like minor Marx Brothers or minor Van Gogh etchings , they are still better than most people's best . The supporting character actors cast , led by Gene Lockhart , Allan Joslyn , and Elizabeth Patterson manage to give a gentleness to the story , befitting the setting in Boston in the " Gilded Age " . It is a nice musical - not great , but enjoyable .
492120	3280905	45325	7.0	Once in Love With Raymond	Ray Bolger's career in movies has a passing resemblance to another performer who did not quite fit in , but who achieved stardom through a back door of sorts : Robert Preston . If one looks at the credits of both men most of their films are quite forgettable , but their musical work lifts them . Yet Bolger , although recognized for his abilities as an eccentric dancer , only hit the target on film twice : as the Scarecrow in " The Wizard of Oz " and as Charley Wykeman in " Where's Charlie " . The first one was a lucky fluke , as he was hired in the Hollywood studio system at it's height . But after appearing in that classic , Bolger was wasted in movies ( one can make an exception with his appearance in " The Harvey Girls " but it is still pale in comparison ) . He had a habit of returning to Broadway , appearing in Roger & Hart's " By Jupiter " in the early 1940s . Then he returned to Broadway in the late 1940s . And he got his greatest Broadway success there as Charley Wykeman in " Where's Charlie " . A musical version of the farce , " Charlie's Aunt " , he played the hero who dresses up as his wealthy aunt from Brazil ( where the nuts come from ) . The highpoint of the musical was when he sang " Once In Love With Amy " , and got the audience to join in the singing . Bolger's performance and enthusiasm made Broadway history . With his established reputation in Hollywood musicals he was able to get the lead in the Hollywood version . So as a result of this we are able to still enjoy that rarity - an actual Broadway star's performance on celluloid in the role he made famous . It is identical to Preston's return to Hollywood as " Professor Harold Hill " in " The Music Man " . But the latter film really began a second half to Preston's career . He would spend most of his later years on Broadway , not in Hollywood , and only pick and choose those films that he wanted to do , culminating with " Victor / Victoria " . That did not happen with Bolger . His next musical , " April in Paris " was with Doris Day , but was not very good . He never starred in another Hollywood film . He played " Barnaby " in Walt Disney's " Babes in Toyland , but most critics did not care for that film either . Bolger's stardom was never in doubt , but his days of growth in his movie roles were over . Not quite like Preston , who seemed to have a better presence for some reason . Still , " Where's Charley ? " is in that select group with " The Man Who Came to Dinner " and " Call Me Madame ! " wherein we are able to see what the Broadway audiences saw . For that alone we should be grateful .
493346	3280905	33365	7.0	Dated self sacrifice , but well acted	This film ( based on a Fanny Hurst best seller ) is way out of date in the modern age . No self-respecting woman would be so willing to sacrifice her career for the prospect of being a millionaire's kept woman . No man , seriously in love with any woman , would put them through such a demeaning situation ( they would consider divorce first of all , then remarriage ) . But there was supposed to be a sense of self-sacrifice by the heroine ( Margaret Sullivan ) that transcended the entire story . It is the acting that saves this film . Sullivan gives another of her touching performances , like THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER and SING NO SAD SONGS FOR ME . Charles Boyer is as charming as ever , here as a potentially important banker who is going to marry his boss's daughter . Instead , he meets Sullivan and is captivated by her spirit and seeming independence . She has a number of male admirers ( Frank McHugh and Frank Jenks among them ) . She's also something of a tease , leading on the others about dating them . Boyer and Sullivan gradually fall in love , but he is resigned ( for ambitions sake ) to marry the boss's daughter . But he sends word to Sullivan that if she will go to the steamboat landing where he is waiting , he would marry her despite his career . She gets the message , and tries to get to the landing . But she chooses to use Jenks as her " taxi driver " , and he ( recalling her promise to go with him for a jaunt into the woods ) , takes her miles in the opposite direction . When he hears her imploring him to turn around , and realizes that she has been teasing him all along , he tells her to get out of the buggy and walk back by herself . So she misses the steamboat , and Boyer ( thinking she stood him up ) leaves to marry the boss's daughter . Years later , after having developed a career as a designer , she meets the married Boyer again , and he convinces her to give up her career and become his mistress . Subsequently , despite warnings from her friend McHugh , and her other boyfriend Richard Carlston , she does not give up her relationship . It lasts until the end of their lives . All the performers are good . Among the minor performances note Tim Holt as Boyer's son who first reads Sullivan the riot act , but subsequently ends up sympathizing with her . Good cast and production , but the story is as dated as a dodo .
492568	3280905	552307	7.0	An unexpected pleasure - my first " Dad's Army " episode on " You Tube "	I had heard of this series , but I had never seen any episodes . Apparently , although in a different spirit of production , DAD'S ARMY had a popularity in England similar to it's near contemporary M . A . S . H . in the U . S . But the situations in both series are not quite the same . Arthur Lowe's Mainwaring ( for Americans : it is pronounced " Mannering " ) is the head of the local civil defense group of elderly or middle aged or physically incapable misfits who are protecting the home front in the period of World War II . It is not a real picnic , as they are experiencing the Nazi Blitz ( and later the buzz bombs ) but the problems of these local heroes are shown with some care and gentleness . Lowe ( who I best knew from his elderly , left-of-center butler in THE RULING CLASS ) is a bank manager , and is somewhat pompous - but he is actually quite intelligent , frequently seeing the idiocy of assignments he and his forces have to perform . He is abetted by Wilson ( John Le Messurier ) who has a calming effect on everyone , but can be reduced to terror if his wife is mentioned . You Tube had this on in three sections . Mainwaring's men are ordered to assist in a morale boosting film that is being shot : they are to appear as Nazi soldiers . Although this is not what the men would have liked ( they would have liked to be British soldiers ) they get to the idea of being in a film with Cecile Courtleigh . But Mainwaring's feelings take a downturn when he finds he can't be fitted with a pair of boots ( his feet are too small - and they have to be Nazi style uniform boots ) . He still remains to watch the men in their work with the film people . A week later they are to be shooting on an open field set . The men are driven in a truck that is closed ( and the weather is very hot - this is in the days when air conditioning was non-existent ) . Mainwaring is the only one who is dressed as a British soldier , so he is driving . The men learn the shooting has been postponed for a week , and they return to their camp . But Mainwaring has to call his superior to explain what happened . He parks the car in front of a local pub , and while on the pay phone the men go into the pub for something to drink . Naturally soon rumors circulate that England has been invaded , and that the Nazis are led by a Quistling British army Captain . The truck reaches the headquarters of Mainwaring's Unit - a church . Word has just reached the locals about the Nazis led by the Quistling . They see Mainwaring addressing the Nazi troops , and run to the Church's bells to start giving a signal to call the locals together for defense . This is the " Ring Dem Bells " of the title . The storyline is obvious - once the men are in those uniforms and we hear they are not to reveal their moonlighting as actors playing Nazis to anyone , we know the misunderstanding will occur . No great surprise there . But what is fun is the interactions of the characters . John Laurie's Scotsman ( Frazer ) complains about how hot the uniform are to wear ( and stiff too ) . When he asks someone about whether he agrees about his complaints about the German helmet , he's told it does make his fierce eyed face look like an eagle ( hardly a negative comment ) . Another member tells how in an earlier war ( one does not know if the earlier war is World War I or the Boer War ) Lord Kitchener hated German helmets , thinking they looked like pots to boil food in . And then there are the two members of the unit who are to play Nazi officers ( Le Messurier and Ian Lavender as his nephew Pike ) . Le Messurier does note the Nazi uniforms do look smart , but Lavender lets his role go to his head - he starts staring out of his monocle , and he insists on not standing with the enlisted men when Mainwaring calls the men to order ( Mainwaring quickly puts that back to normal ) . Later , when the truck is driving along a deserted road , Pike is standing through a vent in the top , " heiling " imaginary crowds ! It was a good episode to catch to get into knowing this series . Hopefully more will be available soon .
493295	3280905	29626	7.0	Supposedly One of Leisin's Best films	I first came across this film when I read a book ( written in the 1970s ) about the career of Mitchell Leisin . I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality . SWING HIGH , SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best . While it did not bore me , it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN , DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY , KITTY , or even GOLDEN EARINGS . I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked . Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals . Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre . It's true that twice standards appeared in his films , but they were really rare cases : " Cocktales for Two " appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES , and " Mona Lisa " came out of CAPTAIN CAREY , U . S . A . But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable . " Mona Lisa " was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY . It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s . Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them ? The score for SWING HIGH , SWING LOW , is pleasant but forgettable . Unfortunately , the movie is centered in the entertainment world , as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player ( he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet ) . The song ( sung by Lombard ) about how her lover's playing thrills her , is important to the plot . It works in the film , but it would have been better if the song was more memorable . There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on , as a manicurist . She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn ( the ship's barber ) . Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal , and we see MacMurray as a soldier , who's enlistment is ending shortly . Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it : MacMurray is talking to Lombard , she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock . Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit . The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson ( MacMurray ) as he meets Lombard , and begins his reputation as a trumpet player , but meets the " other woman " in the film , Dorothy Lamore . The best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with Lombard , and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter ( his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a MacMurray character - even his darker figures like Walter Neff or Mr . Sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the Caine Mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol . Lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by MacMurray . Lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it , but one stands out is her attempt to get MacMurray onto the wagon again . In his opening bit Pangborn is fine . Rarely noticed in films , small part actor Carl Judels is effective as a fair weather fan / friend of MacMurray , who drops him as he goes under ( though he gives him a hand-out ) . Charles Butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual , but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he , his girlfriend , MacMurray , and Lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that MacMurray is insisting is true . It was a nice , subtle moment . If only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor .
492102	3280905	41855	8.0	A Good Example of MGM Ensemble Acting	This is a wonderful movie about how children can occasionally see things more clearly than adults . Herbert Marshall is Mr . Craven ( great name ) the owner of a country estate . His son ( Dean Stockwell ) is bedridden . Marshall is aware that his son is paralyzed , and knows the reason for it . It is the secret that has blighted his once happy and secure family life . A young girl ( Margaret O'Brien , in possibly her best role ) gets a position at the estate , and despite warnings from the landlady ( Dame Gladys Cooper ) gets involved with Stockwell . Stockwell is initially a spoiled brat , but he is so lonely he and O'Brien become friendly . With O'Brien's assistance ( and that of Brian Roper , a boy whose father works on the estate ) Stockwell starts improving . They take him out , and find a large garden that has been locked for years . Nobody is allowed in it by Marshall's orders . But the three children find a way to get in . They go there ( against the order of Marshall and Cooper ) and play in it . Meanwhile Marshall is toying with selling the estate and going abroad . He first has a doctor ( George Zucco , in a rare good person part ) examine Stockwell . Marshall is furious at Zucco's sensible observations that if the boy happens to get air and exercise he will recover . Marshall prefers an incompetent doctor ( Aubrey Mather ) who affirms that Stockwell is beyond hope . The climax is when Marshall is taught a valuable lesson in getting past the past to save the future - I will leave that for the readers of this review to see for themselves . Most of the film was done in black and white , except for one powerful moment at the conclusion . The performances , especially Marshall , Stockwell , and O'Brien , are all perfect in this film as we see how sometimes grown-ups are not as smart as their children .
493305	3280905	36912	8.0	" Look out for Mr . In - Between ! . "	Bing Crosby was highly capable of really memorable acting jobs , but many of his musicals were good for just sheer entertainment . This is a good example of a Crosby film with sheer entertainment value . Crosby is a very popular singer - entertainer named Johnny Cabot . Cabot has been drafted into the navy . He is constantly wearing false whiskers that make him older and less recognizable by his fans , who are mostly young women ( like the bobby soxers ) . He meets a pair of twin sisters played by Barbara Hutton who are both WAVES . One is Susan , who is a madcap type , and the other is Rosemary who is quieter . Actually Hutton does quite well separating the two sisters ' personalities . Susan wants to win Cabot for herself - and the antics of Susan involving Cabot make up most of the film . However , he's more impressed by Rosemary . At the same time , Sonny Tufts is a sailor named Windy who is interested in Susan . Shakespeare it certainly ain't , but it is a well made musical comedy , containing several popular tunes such as " Ac-cen-tu-ate the Positive " and the song which I believe is the show stopper : " There is a Fellow Waiting in Poughkeepsie " , wherein Hutton and the other women singing the song reverse the sexual stereotypes with Crosby and Tufts . Hutton and her pals are like the soldiers and sailors with their little " black books " , full of the names of available dates - only the dates are Crosby , Tufts , and the other males , who are shown concerned about make-up and proper attire for their dates . It's a rather unusual number , and quite good of it's kind . The film was meant as escapism in wartime - and concentrates on the loves of four people in the naval forces during the war . But it is so goofy in it's way that the dated nature of it's original purpose does not really matter . It's fun to watch , so that I can strongly recommend it .
493296	3280905	70472	8.0	Black gold - " Oklahoma " tea	In 1973 I saw this film when it first came out accompanied with my father . We saw it in a movie house out in the Coney Island section in Brooklyn , and it was on a rarity these days - a double bill with a film from France ( I believe it was TRAFFIC by Jacques Tati ) . The movies were entertaining for a change . OKLAHOMA CRUDE was an unexpectedly good film - not a great western but an unusual one . The plot is similar to the plots of many westerns . A woman owns a small parcel of land which is the subject of interest by powerful local interests . Instead of it being land where the local water hole is located ( as in THE BIG COUNTRY ) it is potentially rich oil land . The woman here ( Faye Dunaway ) is very independent and very bitter - her father ( John Mills ) has always been distant and never helped her or her mother . But circumstances force her to rely on Mills and on drifter George C . Scott . Scott is quite a slippery type - out for himself . So Dunaway proceeds to keep him on a tight leash . The local Oil Company represents the big land owner in traditional westerns . And , taking a leaf from SHANE , it's " gunslinger " is Jack Palance . But Palance is a smoother villain ( and at times a funnier one ) than his classic killer in SHANE . When Scott offers to sabotage Dunaway's attempts at fighting the big , bad corporation , Palance , calmly smoking a cigar motions Scott over to him . " I don't think I can use you for that . " , our Jack says in a typically deadly confidential whisper of that gravelly voice of his , " but I'll tell you what . I'll give you $10 . 00 if you'll kiss my ass ! " Scott doesn't reply immediately , but later on he gets a little back at Jack - at a particularly dark threatening moment , Scott pulls his shotgun up against Palance's groin ( lower section ) . Caught off guard and frightened , we see a river come out of Jack's midriff . When he is " emptied out " , he looks disgustedly at his ruined overcoat , strips it off him gingerly , and dumps it on the floor of Dunaway's homestead before he leaves . The film had many choice moments - like John Mills and one of Palance's army of thugs confronting each other , both firing their guns , and both discovering that they have no ammo in their guns . They then have to race to arm their weapon first . . . and it becomes a really close thing . The slapstick moments enliven the film - and even last to the last moments when ( much to Palance's amazement ) his bosses are ready to meet any demand to get that oil . All in all a pretty good and unusual movie , and one that should be seen by people who like western films .
493217	3280905	35101	8.0	Porky's bete noir	This is an amusing cartoon , which ( as was pointed out in another comment on this thread ) was taking a typical Bugs Bunny - Elmer Fudd situation ( " Peace and welaxation at wast ! " , said Elmer in one very similar earlier cartoon ) , using Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as the alternates . At this point in time ( 1942 ) Elmer was still in a period of change in shape and features , sometimes fat and sometimes with a red pickle shaped nose - and sometimes referred to as " Egghead " . But Porky Pig's basics had been laid down by the late 1930s ( originally he too was immensely fat , but gradually his rotundity was made more acceptable ) . Daffy and Bugs went through alterations too , though not as extreme as Porky and Elmer . Both the duck and bunny were anarchistic and malicious , but Bugs had demonstrated a cleverness and control over the world that lasted until the end of every cartoon . Bugs is a master of his universe ( much to the discomfort of such foes as Elmer , Yosemite Sam , Wile E . Coyote ( " Genius " ) , and the Tazmanian Devil . Daffy due to personality problems never is such a master , and the conclusion of this cartoon demonstrates it . Porky is going on a hopefully restful vacation in the wild , but he finds Daffy tagging along to annoy him at every possible moment . This includes preventing him from putting his tent up anywhere on land , and even stealing his food . But the real ace up Daffy's sleeve for most of the cartoon is that it is not Duck hunting season , so nothing can be physically done to harm Daffy by Porky in retaliation for what Daffy has been doing . It is a good trick - unfortunately it doesn't last . Daffy suddenly finds that it is now Duck hunting season , and ( moreover ) he in particular is to be targeted for destruction . Daffy finds he is in serious danger from an enraged Porky . The ending of the cartoon was actually slightly reused years later in a Bugs - Yosemite Sam cartoon , where the film seems to break and we are unaware of what happened to the two characters . It is symbolic of Bugs mastery of his universe as opposed to Daffy's attempt at mastery that Bugs gets the better of Sam , while Porky gets the better of Daffy .
491668	3280905	52700	8.0	Orson Welles and Leopold and Loeb	In 1924 Nathan Leopold and his friend / lover Richard Loeb were two wealthy young Chicagoans , from Jewish American families , who were extremely well educated . Both were believers in the theories ( somewhat twisted ) of Friedrich Nietzche regarding the idea of the superman . They believed that supermen could regard certain laws as being only meant for " little people " , not supermen . One thing they felt they could ignore was the criminal code . . . and this included murder . They decided to commit a perfect crime for the thrill of it . They would kidnap and kill a child , demand a large ransom , and leave a trail of clues that would befuddle the police . To do this they did do some things that showed careful planning ( like stealing a typewriter so they could send untraceable letters ) . Finally they kidnapped a cousin of Leopold , Bobby Franks ( age 14 ) , killed him in their car , mutilated the body with acid and knives , and hid him in a deserted park culvert . Unfortunately for these two geniuses , Leopold dropped a pair of eyeglasses at the site where Bobby was deposited . It was the eyeglasses that led the police to Leopold and then Loeb , and the two supermen were fairly fast in caving in and confessing . The criminal historian , Jonathan Goodman , once wrote that if he ever planned to commit a murder and would ask infamous criminals for advice , he would certainly choose Burke and Hare ( the Edinburgh body snatchers , who were not caught until they killed 16 people ) over Leopold and Loeb . They did not hang . Their families hired America's greatest attorney , Clarence Darrow , to defend them . He pleaded guilty for them , but requested a bench trial ( just a judge ) for the sentencing . His theory was that a jury would never be able not to divorce the cruelty of their actions from consideration of their punishment . For Darrow , a lifelong opponent of the death penalty , was unwilling to risk losing two guilty clients to public hatred . He gave a classic discussion of the death penalty , and how it would not do what the public wished - stop further crime as a warning , and bring back ( or closure to the family of ) Bobby Frank . And the Judge did decide to not order the execution of Leopold and Loeb . They were sentenced to life plus ninety nine years ( the sentence was later used as the title of Leopold's autobiography ) . But Richard Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936 ( he made a homosexual advance on a fellow prisoner who slashed him to death - and was not punished for it ) . Leopold was released in 1958 . He married , moved to Puerto Rico where he worked as a nurse , and died in 1971 . COMPULSION is based on a novel by Meyer Levin ( a best seller in the late 1950s ) , that was based on the case , changing the names of Leopold and Loeb to Artie Strauss and Judd Steiner . The film only goes through the crime and the trial , culminating in the performance of Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilkes ( a . k . a . Clarence Darrow ) . Dean Stockwell plays a sympathetic , confused Leopold ( an issue among criminal historians - how really weak was Leopold - was he Loeb's sex slave ? ) and Bradford Dillman as a more aggressive Loeb . Martin Milner plays their college friend ( and Leopold's rival for a girl in the class ) , who also finds the eyeglasses . E . G . Marshall is District Attorney Horn ( and gives a very effective performance as an intelligent adversary of the two criminals as well as Welles ) . Diane Varsi plays the girl both Stockwell and Milner love . For some reason her performance is considered weak - actually while not fascinating it was more than competent . The film does show the crime in it's aftermath ( unlike the other film version of the Leopold-Loeb Case - ROPE - this movie does not the actual murder ) . It shows the increasing nervousness of Leopold , while Loeb keeps his cool ( even " helping " the police investigation by suggesting some possible suspects of pedophile leanings ) . It is ( unlike ROPE ) shot as a period film , in the 1920s , but the film is in black and white - so the period costumes and accessories are not detracting from the action . It is a well done film , but Welles appearance is only in the last half hour , culminating in the speech before the judge and his effective parting shot at Stockwell , who feels there is no God ( " Perhaps it was God who made you drop your eyeglasses . " ) . Welles performance of the speech was so effective that it was recorded on a record and was a best seller that year . And it is beautifully done . But the film misses one point . Darrow did not win the sentence he sought by convincing the Judge of the impracticality of the death sentence . The Judge actually dismissed this argument of Darrow's . But Leopold and Loeb were under 21 . He felt they were too young to be hanged . It has been suggested that COMPULSION and ROPE could be shown together , but it would equally be possible to view COMPULSION with INHERIT THE WIND , to compare the performances of Welles with Spencer Tracy as Darrow / Henry Drummond in the latter film . There is also a peculiar type of movie loop in COMPULSION and INHERIT THE WIND . COMPULSION has a scene where Welles , is in his hotel room , when he sees some Ku Klux Klanners light a cross outside his window . In INHERIT THE WIND Tracy answers his hotel door room to see Gene Kelly ( as H . L . Mencken / E . K . Hornbeck ) wearing a hood and saying " Boo " as a joke . This is a reference to Darrow's agnostic / atheistic reputation , which was disliked by many people in his day . And early in INHERIT THE WIND when Kelly announces that Dick York ( as Bertram Cates - John Scopes ) will be defended by Tracy , one of the townspeople says , " He just got those two child-murderers off the other day . " ) . It is rare for two films to have such mutual references in them , when they are not sequel films .
492329	3280905	87864	8.0	Jewish Travails in Brooklyn and Manhattan	OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE is probably not well recalled by most people today , but the film is only twenty two years old , and certainly captured a spirit that is rarely seen in American films . For all the so call liberalism of the American cinema , certain aspects of ethnicity are quietly buried . Anti - Semitism was attacked in GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT , but the anti-Semitism under scrutiny was a social form ( you can't join certain clubs , you can't get certain jobs , you can't register in certain four - star hotels ) which is annoying but somewhat bearable compared to European or Middle Eastern versions . Except for one notorious incident ( the Leo Frank trial , and lynching ) in Georgia in 1915 , it is rare that the degree of anti-Semitism in this country has gotten so hot as to make Jews literally fear for their lives . In the case of the Frank affair , the Anti-Defimation League of B'Nai Brith was created . But that was the real highpoint of rabid anti-Semitism going so far . One of the misguided ways that Hollywood has acted to reduce the tension is to ignore or make fun of it or concentrate on other side issues . So if we see Jewish lives at home , it is done in a funny manner . For example : in MY FAVORITE YEAR Alan Swann the famous movie star is invited to a Jewish home for dinner , and he is well treated , but the family act like a bunch of clumsy oafs in their reactions to the polished ( if drunken ) Swann . Most of the time Jews don't act so stupidly , but not in Hollywood comedies . OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE tried to mingle the comic with the dramatic in a study of religious bigotry and financial muscle . Alby Sherman ( Elliot Gould ) is a coffee shop owner in Brooklyn who has been saving his money and planning to buy a fancy eatery on the east side of Manhattan . To do this he is dependent on the good will of his Uncle Benjamin ( Sid Caesar ) , who has made a good living in the clothing trade . Benjamin is very fond of Alby , looking at him as the son he always wanted ( Benjamin has a wife and son , but the son is a smirking non-entity , and certainly not one to have a wife and children ) . However , Benjamin is very conscious of being Jewish , and he wants Alby to marry a Jewish girl . Alby is currently shacked up with Elizabeth ( Margaux Hemingway ) , who is a " shiksa " ( a non-Jewish woman ) . Ben is not happy about this , and basically lets Alby know that if he wishes to get financial assistance from his uncle he has to drop Elizabeth . To his credit Alby does not do so - he tries to find alternatives to going to Ben ( even toying with a loan shark ) . Ben , in the meantime , presumes to meddle further by confronting Elizabeth and asking if she really wants to hurt Alby or sacrifice their love to enable him to succeed . Ben , of course , does not see his meddling in a bad light . He even has a replacement for Elizabeth in mind - Alby's distant cousin Cheryl ( Carol Kane ) , a schoolteacher who lives with her elderly father , and appears to be demure and quiet . The film follows the twists and turns of our hero and his family and Elizabeth . We see a world that Jews are fully aware of , where members of families know each other's business whether they should or not , and where diplomatic maneuvering is as vital on a small scale as the same maneuvers would be between nation states . The film had many funny moments . One I cherish is meek little Cheryl finally cutting loose with the wrong person . Another is when Alby is desperate enough to make a late night phone call from Time Square , turn down the silent request of a derelict for some change , and get a commentary on his generosity he never expected . But to me the most interesting part is watching Sid Caesar's performance . Usually playing comic roles , such as in THE BUSY BODY or in Mel Brooks ' SILENT MOVIE , Caesar has always showed how to exaggerate successfully for a laugh . Only he would introduce a drunken woman to a dummy as his friend Matthias Kreplach , the millionaire , in THE BUSY BODY . But here , despite some mild comic touches ( his dealing with the Japanese businessmen ) most of his performance is serious . In fact , OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE was Caesar's best straight performance in a motion picture . The scene when he finally collapses and explains why he relied on Alby towards the end of the film was a small marvel , as he literally collapses in tears admitting to decades of personal disappointments . Aside from that the performance of Margaux Hemingway haunts me a little . Made less than a decade after her first film ( LIPSTICK ) she should have been having a first rate career . In many ways OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE represented the highpoint of her career , as most of the other titles were far more obscure . She seemed to have the world open to her in 1984 , and few could tell that it would be over so badly in twelve years . For her , the glimpse into Jewish life and real problems , and for Sid Caesar's best dramatic work , I give OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE a " 10 " .
493378	3280905	32258	8.0	Stanley Ridges Makes The Most of It .	There are a lot of aspects about this fine film which are odd . Coming at the end of the first horror film cycle , it re-teamed Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi , but they never shared a scene in the film . The character who was most interesting ( actually two characters , literally welded into one ) was Professor George Kingsley / " Red " Cannon played by Stanley Ridges . The screenplay was partially written by Curt Siodmak , who would eventually return to the subject of brain surgery and transplanted brains ( to far better effect , it must be admitted ) in " Donavan's Brain " . But that novel and film looked at the threat of unhampered capitalism in the hands of an evil man . That's not the case in " Black Friday " , which touches on greed ( a missing half a million dollars in 1940 dollars ) but also looks at the struggle of personality - as appears in " Donavan'S Brain " as well . Whatever was the reason that Boris and Bela did not share scene space ( and jealousy can't be ruled out - Bela's feeling that Boris was too good a competitor in the area of horror films is well known ) , they don't appear together . It's hard to imagine how their characters , Dr . Ernest Sovak and gangster boss Eric Marnay , could have shared any scenes . Most likely they might have shared one if Marney tried to sabotage the brain transplant at the hospital ( to make sure that Cannon dies ) by threatening Sovak's daughter or by kidnapping the doctor . But the screenplay would have been radically different then . There was one aspect of the film that was never fully affected in the production . When Marnay is captured by Cannon , he is shut in an airtight closet and locked in . We see Marnay yelling to be let out . Eventually we see him collapse and die . In the planning stages of the production Bela was supposed to be hypnotized into gradually looking weaker and weaker while being suffocated . The scheme did not work well on film . There are stills showing Bela undergoing hypnosis for the attempted treatment . Siodmak is fascinated by the way certain personalities dominate . Warren Donavan's is strong enough ( and his rejuvenated brain - thanks to Dr . Cory - even stronger ) to take over the brains of Cory and of a greedy news photographer in that film ( among others ) . Here Kingsley is a sweet old fellow - a close friend of Sovak - who has the misfortune of getting seriously injured in the assassination attack on Cannon . Cannon is a brutal creep , who thinks nothing about hurting anyone if it gets what he wants . It's the key role in the film , and Ridges was the right guy to get it . Stanley Ridges was one of those actors who never disappointed you . In " Yellow Jack " he is this doctor working on the Yellow Fever cure , who when Henry Hull dies accidentally questions the logic and correctness of the experiment . It seems they had to give Yellow Fever to the subjects ( volunteers ) but accidentally Hull got infected and died . Ridges ' scene is a brief one , but he actually hit the moral center of the movie - Hull's character , Dr . Lazear , was a widely gifted man . What was the gain to the world by the loss of someone like this due to this experiment ? Another example ( again based on history ) was in " The Suwpect " with Charles Laughton . Based on the 1910 Crippen Case , Ridges plays the Scotland Yard Inspector ( based on the real life Inspector Walter Dew ) who realized that the death was no accident and pursued his quarry step by step . While not following Dew's success in catching Crippen , like Dew with the Doctor Ridges gets to sympathize with Laughton as a basically good man caught up in a nightmare . Laughton was a super-actor , and only one of his own type could come off well with him . Ridges could play villains . He is Ronald Colman's cynical friend in " If I Were King " who sees the conflict with Charles the Bold against Louis XI as an opportunity to loot Paris ( while Colman would save Paris ) . He could play sympathetic losers , as in " The Scoundrel " , as Noel Coward's rival over a woman . He could play anything . He delineates his two roles perfectly , to the point that they seem to be two men ( even his features get younger as Cannon ) . Kingsbury , a charming fellow in the script , gets progressively more and more confused at the personality switches - reassured by Sovac it is part of his recovery . But every time he hears heavy bell ringing ( did Siodmak think of Pavlov's dog experiment ? ) he changes into the bullying Cannon . Ironically it is Cannon who deservedly gets shot in the end , but poor Kingsbury who dies wondering why he was shot . Karloff posthumously attempts to explain .
492517	3280905	39306	8.0	A Sympathetic Viper and his Viperish Wife	A day or so ago I commented on the film ( made only a few years after wards ) that somehow resembles this one : FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG . The basic story is of two ill-matched people who are in a marriage from hell . FOOTSTEPS was about a Victorian gentleman who murders his first wife , only to be blackmailed into marrying his socially ambitious maid , and how he starts conspiring to get rid of her as well . The problem with FOOTSTEPS was a lack of decently spirited direction . It lacked spark and pace , and gets boring . The cast tries , but it does not help enough . Not so with DEAR MURDERER . Unlike FOOTSTEPS ( which was a Hollywood product - so it had to be burdened by larger budgets , and needed vervier directing ) , DEAR MURDERER is typical of the success story of British cinema - how with a concentration on minimal effect their films are sharper than bloated productions like FOOTSTEPS . The plot is also more devious . In FOOTSTEPS Jean Simmons ' ambitions help destroy her and Steward Granger . But one can easily understand where she is coming from , as we tend to sympathize with people trying to pull themselves out of lower classes into upper classes . But this is dented because she is a blackmailer ( though Granger's misdeed deserves such a punishment ) . Here , Eric Portman is married to a perpetual flirt ( Greta Gynt ) who despises him . She has been carrying on with Dennis Price , and Portman decides to kill Price . Yet , even in the process of doing just that , Portman gets to know his victim , and realizes that if he had not been sleeping with his wife Price could have been a good friend of his . So his guilt is increased when he discovers that Gynt and Price had broken up their relationship shortly before the murder . See : the story is still melodramatic , but the characterization is more interesting . So is the difference regarding Gynt's personae , as opposed to her opposite number in FOOTSTEPS . Simmons is socially ambitions , but the audience can accept that . Gynt is sluttish and also unlikeable . She is tired about the marriage to Portman ( who does , misguidedly , love Gynt ) , and eventually wonders how she can end it - quickly . The film speeds to it's conclusion . If one dislikes Portman's Nazi in 49TH PARALLEL ( his best remembered performance ) , his performance here certainly makes up for his totally unsympathetic villainy there . I have no problem recommending this film to the readers of these reviews . And of recommending it over FOOTSTEP IN THE FOG to them as well .
492001	3280905	32349	8.0	Rivalries in a Communist " Utopia "	Ernst Lubtisch's classic comic statement about Communist Russia , NINOTCHKA , came out in 1939 . Whether it " influenced " the production ( also by MGM ) of COMRADE X or not I could not say . Certainly there are similarities between the comedies . Lubitsch set his comedy in Paris , where a Communist trade mission is living it up , being corrupted by an émigré Russian noble ( Melvin Douglas ) so he can try to retrieve jewelry that the trade mission is using as collateral . The Russian government does not trust the three men sent , so they send a fiercer ideologue ( Greta Garbo in the title role ) who starts straightening out the mission , until she falls for Douglas's charm . In the end she is lured back ( with her three associates ) to the west and away from the Soviet paradise . NINOTCHKA had Felix Bressart and Sig Ruman in the cast as two of the members of the trade mission . Comments on this thread point out that in the 1930s " accents " were fairly interchangeable in Hollywood , so that the Swedish Garbo ( and later the Austrian Lamarr ) became Russian . So did German Ruman and German - Jewish Bressart ( who would also play a Hungarian in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER ) . Unlike NINOTCHKA , COMRADE X is set inside that nightmare land , Stalinist Russia . Somebody is sending out unofficial ( but thoroughly correct ) news stories showing the crimes being committed in Russian by the government against the people ( i . e . the purges ) , as well as the idiotic projects and waste mismanagement illustrative of how poorly the government is as effective government . This is being resented by the Presidium , who is represented by Oscar Homlolka ( Commissar Vasiliev ) . Please note that Homolka's make-up makes him look a tremendous bit like one Joseph Stalin . At a public funeral covered by the press court , someone tries to shoot Vasiliev ( who does all he can to hide the assassination plot ) . Mac Thompson ( Clark Gable ) , the American reporter , manages to snap a photo of an odd site - a bearded man who a moment before the shooting opened up the lid of the coffin and popped out . This bearded gentlemen turns out to be one Michael Bastakoff ( Vladimir Sokoloff ) , a rival of Vasiliev for power . He is made to look a tremendous bit like one Leon Trotsky . Get the message from Hollywood here ? Vasiliev's agents have been trying to pin down the news leaks , and has narrowed it to two figures : Thompson , and one Emil Von Hofer ( Sig Ruman ) who is the news representative from Nazi Germany . Ruman manages to demonstrate it ain't him , so ( despite Gable's breezy denials ) Vasiliev believes it is the American . Gable has a close friend in Moscow , one Ygor Yahupitz ( Felix Bressart ) who is his sometimes valet . Ygor's daughter is Galubcha ( Hedy Lamarr ) who is a streetcar operator . Ygor wants Gable to try to smuggle Galubcha out of the Soviet Union into the U . S . And the film shows ( among other things , including overcoming Galubcha's fierce belief in the Communist ideal ) Gable eventually saving both the girl and her father . The comedy is quite amusing , even if it lacks the style and grace of the Lubitsch touch of the first film . But it certainly comments on the atmosphere within Russia in a way that NINOTCHKA failed to do so . The centering of the comedy in Moscow , the suggestiveness of a Stalin - Trotsky rivalry clone , and the heavy control over information is certainly more realistic than Douglas ' being elegant and eloquent about the beauties of Paris . One more thing to keep in mind is a scandal which is on target with this film , and which ( in 1940 ) finally began to raise eyebrows . In the early 1930s the New York Times had a reporter named Walter Duranty in Moscow . He turned out to be a fantastically well informed reporter in the Soviet Union , and came out with interviews and articles that were tremendously informative . In fact , he would win the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from Moscow . But as time passed , Duranty's methods and sources were heavily questioned . He also tended to take an official line about the Purge Trials ( i . e . , that Bukhanin , Radek , Zinoviev , Tuchochevsky , and the other hundreds and thousands of victims were all actual traitors against the Stalinist regime ) . After the signing of the non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939 , the Times became very suspicious of Duranty , and replaced him . The quality of the articles became very much more even handed . Duranty was later revealed to be a Stalinist agent . Interestingly enough , the Pulitzer Committee has repeatedly rejected requests to take back their award from Duranty's heirs as his work was pure propaganda . So the issue about the control over the news from Russia was very , very real .
493199	3280905	87559	8.0	The Isolated Shakespeare History Play	In the early 1980s the B . B . C . did the complete plays of William Shakespeare in a series that ran over five years . They played in the U . S . A . once , and then never played again . It's a pity , because some of the Shakespeare plays ( TIMON OF ATHENS , PERICLES , PRINCE OF TYRE , ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL , CYMBELINE ) are not produced that frequently . Of the 37 or 38 titles ( depending on if you count THE TWO NOBLE KINSMAN that Shakespeare wrote with John Fletcher ) that are usually ascribed to the Bard , only twenty get produced . Look at the titles here , and see how many movie versions of OTHELLO , MACBETH , HAMLET , ROMEO AND JULIET there are as opposed to say AS YOU LIKE IT or MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING . Shakespeare's plays are divided up into three groups : Histories , Tragedies , and Comedies . There is actually some overlap , as several of the tragedies ( JULIUS CAESAR , CORIOLANUS , ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA , KING LEAR , CYMBELINE ) are based on historical or legendary figures ) . But the one's officially labeled " Histories " have these titles : KING JOHN ; RICHARD II ; HENRY IV , PARTS I and II ; HENRY V ; HENRY VI , PARTS I , II , and III ; RICHARD III ; HENRY VIII ) . We are aware that Shakespeare also wrote a scene in a play whose manuscript exists called The Play of " SIR THOMAS MORE " , dealing with the life of that political writer and martyr . As More was a contemporary ( and victim ) of Henry VIII , those two plays are contemporary in historical content , and only the lack of a play called HENRY VII prevent their linking with the bulk of the plays from RICHARD II to RICHARD III ( all dealing with the years from 1397 to 1485 . As we realize other plays of Shakespeare's may be missing or non-recognized so far ( recently one called EDWARD III was suggested as a play of Shakespeare's and produced to mixed reviews ; Charles Hamilton , the New York autograph expert , found a missing play , CARDENIO , based on a Cervantes ' story a decade ago ) , it is likely there were plays called HENRY II or EDWARD THE CONFESSOR . History plays were very popular . But at this moment KING JOHN is unique as the first ( in terms of chronology ) of the histories , and the most isolated one . JOHN takes place from 1199 - 1216 , when that monarch reigned and died . We have been aware of him from other sources . As the troublesome rival and younger brother of Richard the Lion Hearted ( King Richard I ) he is important in the films THE LION IN WINTER , THE CRUSADES , KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADES , ROBIN HOOD , ROBIN AND MARIAN . He is the unscrupulous schemer , out to get that throne his brother Richard possessed . Unlike the later King Richard III ( as Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More presented him ) he is not a successful schemer . He only gets the throne when Richard dies . Richard had no legitimate heir . So John has no real problem - except everyone hates and distrusts him . KING JOHN follows as the pig-headed monarch turns off his nobles ( culminating in his greatest " achievement " - the Magna Carta he was forced to sign ) , gets his kingdom under a papal interdict ( he never learned from his brilliant father's example with Thomas A'Becket to avoid controversies with Rome ) , and he allows the English hating Philip of France ( again , remember THE LION IN WINTER ) to invade to depose the interdicted John . He also faces an attempt to put the son of his older brother Geoffrey to replace him . It's a messy bit of history - another reason it is not frequently performed . Leonard Rossiter is best recalled for his comedy performances , especially in the Reginald Perrin television series . He gave a convincing performance here as an unscrupulous and inept monarch , who managed to lose control very quickly . The amazing thing was he died still King , and passing on the throne . Luc Arthur played Arthur , the nephew who became such an unwitting threat to the monarch , and John Thaw played Hubert De Burgh , who tries to help young Arthur but fails .
492392	3280905	21511	8.0	" And to Hell with Burgundy ! "	The early sound films were in one sense a step forward and in another sense two steps back . If you look at the late silent films , like Chaplin's " A Woman Of Paris " or Murnau's " Sunrise " the stories are sophisticated , as is the acting and the directing techniques . But the films are mimed plays - we don't hear any dialog ( we may hear musical accompaniment ) . Then comes 1927 and " The Jazz Singer " . Finally we hear something , and it is worthwhile ( it's Al Jolson's voice - talking and singing ) . But even there huge parts of that first talkie are silent ( the Warner Brothers were not willing to destroy everyone at once ) . By 1930 , except for Chaplin ( constructing " City Lights " ) , most of Hollywood was switched to talkies . But the early problems of acoustics and sound recording make many of these films difficult for modern audiences . Also , a reluctance to trust voices of established stars led to over reliance on stage performers . Dennis King happened to be an exceptionally talented actor and singer . Oddly enough ( due to his own choice ) he decided to stick to stage work until television came into it's own ( and then he willingly got into that new medium ) . This is fine , because it leaves a record of his acting abilities ( and of his singing ) . But he only made a few movies in Hollywood , and the best known one is not his initial film " The Vagabond King " , but his supporting turn as comic villain and lover in " The Devil's Brother " / " Fra Diavalo " with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . It's ironic that that performance is recalled , but understandable given the alternative two ( although both are good performances ) . His gentle vicar in " Between Two Worlds " has a moving scene where he leads the passengers on that odd ocean liner into a quiet , childlike prayer - a very fine sequence , by the way . And his performance as the brilliant gutter poet of the 15th Century France , Francois Villon , is preserved in " The Vagabond King " , one of the leading American operetta of the 1920s . But the former part is not the lead role of " Between Two Worlds " , and the productions standards of " The Vagabond King " are hopelessly dated today . Still " The Vagabond King " has much going for it : four top performances by King , Jeannette MacDonald as Katherine ( the King's niece ) , O . P . Heggie as the crafty old " Spider King " Louis IX of France , and Lillian Roth as Villone's girlfriend and ( ultimately ) savior Huguette . Given the datedness of the dialog ( from Justin McCarthy's turn of the century play , " If I Were King " , the leads manage to squeeze every drop of value out of it . Sometimes without the dialog ( look at the scene where a shaved Villon awakes in a royal bedroom , and slowly realizes things have changed ) . Look at Roth's moment singing of her love for Villon in the tavern ( when he is missing and considered in custody ) . MacDonald has to play a " perfection " part - a perfect princess who Villon falls quickly in love with and who slowly falls for him ( when he is made respectable by the King's whims ) . It is a thankless role ( she can't have much fun being perfect ) but she radiates charm , and her singing songs like " Only a rose " ( that one in duet with King ) reminds the viewer of things to come in her future when her partners were named Maurice or Nelson , not Dennis . Heggie's King does not sing in the film , but he gets the craftiness of the " Spider King " . But not quite the brilliance of the political genius of that sinister man . Catch Basil Rathbone's version in the Ronald Colman version of IF I WERE KING later on to see that . However Heggie does capture Louis ' least likable trait - he was one of the most vindictive men of his age . Fighting against them is the sound equipment and direction . Some aspects of the stage production were saved . The different types of servants serving Villon in the palace ( fat men as waiters bringing breakfast ) , ladies in waiting to amuse him , and dwarfs to help dress him ) must have been in the original Broadway production . Another positive thing is the amount of Friml's score ( at least three of his best songs are in the film , including the celebrated " Sons of Toil and Danger " . But the sound quality is awful , and the director at times fails to show any talent at all ( like his failure to show two duel scenes between King and his enemy the Grand Marshal of France ( a somewhat wasted Warner Oland - did part of his part end up being cut ? ) ) . It's interesting to note that only three years later ( 1933 ) King appeared in " The Devil's Brother " . Tendencies to emote which he had in 1930 ( another failure of the director of " The Vagabond King " to control ) were replaced by a more relaxed style , and the sound quality improved remarkably well too . Therefore it's another plus for the Laurel & Hardy comedy ( as King's best performance on film ) as opposed to the historically more important Villon in the current movie . All of which is terribly ironic . But for the strength of his performance , as well as his three leading co-stars ( I wish Oland's was as good as theirs were ) , and the Friml score , the film is worthy of an " 8 " out of " 10 " .
493192	3280905	87590	8.0	The Price of Gallipoli : 1939 - 1945	I have mentioned ( in reviewing the television film , CHURCHILL AND THE GENERALS ) that Sir Winston had a tragically inflated view of his ideas on military strategy . In particular his constant insistence that the way to win wars against a Continental power ( Germany ) was to attack Europe by it's " soft underbelly " . Twice the result was disaster . In World War II it would be the fight for the island of Crete , which actually was a bloodbath for both England and Germany . In World War I it was the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915 , best remembered for the name of one location in the straits involved : Gallipoli . Churchill wanted to use a surprise attack on the Turks to force allied troops into Constantinople and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war ( and provide a means of supplying the Tsar of Russia and his forces ) . The leadership of this enterprise was in General Sir Ian Hamilton , who was not an inspiring or clever leader . While he spent most of his time on a yacht in the Aegean , tens of thousands of Allied soldiers were killed in a series of stupid , costly attacks . Many of these casualties were known as " Anzacs " . They were volunteer soldiers from the colonies of Australia and New Zealand . And in the end the campaign was a failure . The only positive achievements were that it brought pride to the Turks for defending their territory , and that it brought to the forefront their national hero Mustafa Kemal ( later their President and modernizer , Kemal Ataturk ) . The Australians were not happy at being used as useless cannon fodder . They had only unified the various colonies on the smallest continent in 1901 , and this was ( actually ) their second experience in warfare that didn't benefit them . They had supplied troops for the second Anglo-Boer War ( 1899 - 1902 ) only to have a small flare-up of anger at the questionable court-martial and execution of " Breaker " Morant in that war . The Australians were mostly descended from convicts from Britain , and there were always questions about why they were loyal to the mother country that threw them out . Gallipoli made them even more suspicious . With the coming of World War II the conflict between Britain and Australia would come to a head , and leave Britain with the realization that Australia was going to be less and less likely to be attached to them in the future . Churchill would be the first to discover this . Churchill ( Timothy West here ) became Prime Minister in 1940 due to the failure of the campaign to save Norway from Nazi invasion . Churchill expected that the entire British Commonwealth of Nations would fully support the war effort ( soon he would discover that Eamonn De Valera of Ireland was declaring neutrality for the duration , and there was nothing he could do about it ) . But most unexpected was Australia . The Southern Cross country had just had an election in which the perennially elected Tory Prime Minister Robert Menzies ( John Wood ) was defeated by John Curtin ( Michael Blakemore ) the Labor Party leader . This was unsettling to Churchill , but he figured that Australia would fall in line . It didn't happen that way . Curtin ( whose cabinet included the Australian Prime Minister from World War I , Billy Hughes ( Jon Ewing ) ) was suspicious of any British control over Australian troops . The cabinet ( which was a coalition ) agreed with him . Churchill tried to ignore this , but found his military ideas constantly being questioned by Curtin . After all , Churchill planned Gallipoli . This television film follows how Curtin gradually pulled out all stops to insist that Australia controlled it's own military destiny . Unlike DeValera in Eire , Curtin faced a foe ( the Japanese ) who were soon attacking Port Moresby , and threatening invasion through New Guinea . He wanted all the Australian military reserves used for defending the homeland . Chuchill kept trying to send them to the Middle East and Europe . The crux of the confrontation was when Churchill tried to put Australian troops in Egypt ( to bolster North African defenses ) when Curtin objected . Churchill sent them to Singapore ( closer to Australia geographically ) where they were all captured when the " Gibraltar of the East " fell to Japan . Slowly Curtin begins to reverse the history of Australia , and tie it's future to it's cousin country the United States . The commander of Australia's forces , General Tom Blamey ( Ray Barrett ) works closely with General Douglas MacArthur ( Robert Vaughn ) in the struggle in New Guinea . Blamey's men reverse the Japanese advance , allowing the Americans to send in reinforcements . MacArthur was always grateful and respectful to Blamey ( who he made sure was present at the Japanese surrender on the U . S . S . Missouri in 1945 ) . Curtin died before the war ended , but he knew that he had made his point to the mother country about his nation's coming of age . Churchill underplayed the slap in his face , but realized that Curtin's activities were one more step in the replacement of Britain by the U . S . as the world's superpower . The film followed this little known story ( little known here in the U . S . ) quite well . Timothy West has played Churchill several times , and has the great man's brilliance and arrogance down pat . Blakemore plays Curtin as a decent man who finds a world crisis on his watch , and rises truly to the occasion . Wood is wasted - Menzies got stuck in London as part of the Imperial War Cabinet , so he was ( oddly enough ) out of the loop of Australian politics during much of the war . Ironically one side of his London period is ignored : in 1942 there was a move to try to replace Churchill . Menzies , with his long service as Australian Premier was seen as an alternative . But military news started improving , and the coup never occurred . As for Barrett as Blamey , he makes the General sympathetic by showing his struggles with a helpless Curtin for supplies , and slowly winning Vaughn's MacArthur's respect as a fighter . As a historical television film it was quite good ,
492144	3280905	45408	8.0	Leon Ames ' turn at bat	William Powell was such a great actor that to attempt to do one of his roles as well was highly difficult . His Nick Charles is light years more interesting ( in a handful of movies ) than the entire television series with Peter Lawford playing the same role . Occasionally an actor could duplicate his part as well as he - his doomed murderer lover in ONE WAY PASSAGE was done as well by George Brent in ' TIL WE MEET AGAIN . But Brent was an exception to this . Another example is the " snitch " character in BEAU GESTE . Powell's character in the 1926 silent film was really a total knave ( he was a sneak thief , a coward , and a snitch ) but J . Carroll Naish's reprise of the same character ( but with a different name ) in the 1939 sound version was equally memorable ( mostly due to Naish's hyena-like laughter ) . In 1947 Powell had one of his finest performances as Clarence Day Sr . in Michael Curtiz's LIFE WITH FATHER . Pompous and domineering and no nonsense , he is the perfect representation of the high Victorian " Pater Familias " of 1885 . His word is the law of the house ( theoretically ) , and ( as he says with unconscious self-mockery ) his is " the character " of his home . But he never realizes that , without trying to , his wife Vinnie ( Irene Dunne ) constantly undercuts his authority and control on household spending by confusing his questions on accounts by her logical illogic ( remember the exchange of the pug-dog for the " free suit " at the department store ? ) . Powell had only another decade of films left to him , and he never showed interest in television . He had nothing to prove with the public , and would leave the acting scene on a high note as " Doc " in MR . ROBERTS . But he may have been curious about the slight success ( from 1953 to 1955 ) of a television version of LIFE WITH FATHER starring ( for it's first two seasons ) a fine character actor Leon Ames . Ames had been in movies since the 1930s ( his first notable role as " C . Auguste Dupin " in MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE with Bela Lugosi - but under his real name of " Leon Waycoff " ) . Since then , while never achieving leading man status like Powell , he was in some juicy supporting roles , such as the clever District Attorney in the 1946 THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE , and as the head of the family ( who learns a lesson in what is important from watching his crying youngest daughter ) in MEET ME IN ST . LOUIS . Capable of good characters ( the angel in YOLANDA AND THE THIEF ) and villains ( twice against Powell in " THE THIN MAN " Series ) Ames was a good choice to play Mr . Day . I was too young to see episodes of television's LIFE WITH FATHER in the period it was on the air - but in the 1960s episodes reappeared on some of the " lesser channels " in the New York Metropolitan area such as channel 9 and channel 11 . It was a fairly interesting series , with attempts to show the Day family in their time period . Given the half hour episodes , more time could be spent on different areas of the culture , social mores , and even politics of the time . For example , Ames played Mr . Day like Powell did , being very outspoken and opinionated . In one episode he dislikes door to door salesman , and gets so upset at the junk his family buys ( in this case a defective egg " sheller " which destroys an egg when it's suppose to remove the shell ) that he writes a letter to the New York Times protesting door to door salesmen . The joke of the episode's plot is that Day finds his letter categorized as an attack on " free enterprise " . Since he is a stock broker his fellows on Wall Street are amazed at his views on the American economy ( then in the heyday of " laissez faire " ) . Ames , abetted by Lurleen Tuttle as Vinnie , did nicely as Mr . Day , but the writing of the episodes faltered . They tended to build up to his discomforting at the end of each one . Yet my memories of the best moments of the show are surprisingly warm . I don't recall the third season ( when Ames left the show and the role ) , and I wonder if any of those were ever re-aired . But when he was on he kept the show lively , and certainly did not fail to maintain the high standards that Powell set in the film version of six years earlier .
492843	3280905	41107	8.0	Mr . Milland's Longevity	Ray Milland managed to do something that few critics were ever willing to admire him for . He was a good looking man of Welsh ( not English ) ancestry , who could play members of the English upper class . But he was always willing to stretch a bit more than other similar actors . For one thing , he could play villains . Even in his early career he was frequently cast as a weakling or a gigolo ( as in " We're Not Dressing " ) . He was willing to experiment with comic roles as well as straight drama . The result was that from 1942 to 1951 or so Milland was a Hollywood star . He played the leads in films as various as " Reap the Wild Wind " , " The Major and the Minor " , " The Ministry of Fear " , " The Big Clock " , " The Lost Weekend " , " Golden Earings " , and " Alias Nick Beal " . While some of his films were comedies ( such as " The Major and the Minor " and " Skylark " ) quite a number were dramas or even melodramas . And some of his characters skirt the edge of acceptable behavior . He is a man who has just been released for committing a mercy killing of his wife in " The Ministry of Fear " . Although he is basically innocent , he is a flirtatious type in " The Big Clock " . Even in Wilder's " The Major and The Minor " there is a moment when Milland , smiling at the thought of what a real " knockout " " Sue-sue Applegate " ( actually grown-up Ginger Rogers ) is , suddenly gets a really pained look in his face - he does not like that he's thinking lascivious thoughts about a child . His deserved " Oscar " for " The Lost Weekend " is another example of this dark side - he is supposed to be a writer , but he is a poseur with a serious drinking problem . In fact , he contemplates suicide at the conclusion of the film , only to be stopped by Jane Wyman . In " Alias Nick Beal " he played his most sinister part ( except possibly Tony Wendice in " Dial " M " For Murder " ) . Here he played Satan , and he is in total control of the game throughout of the movie - the game being politics and power over people . On one level , if one forgets the supernatural elements , " Alias Nick Beal " is as good an abject lesson in the back room deals of American politics as the comedies " The Senator Was Indiscreet " or Preston Sturges ' " The Great McGinty " . Only here , with violent death thrown in , the seediness of it all becomes more apparent . Possibly the best moment is when the honest , and mostly honorable , Thomas Mitchell is forced to shake hands with Fred Clark , the most notorious political boss in the state . On the other level is the serious attempt to keep some religious allegory in , with people like George Macready ( here in a rare good guy part ) noting that Beal resembles an ancient picture of the Devil , and that " Los islas de las almas perditas " where Beal comes from means , " The Island of Lost Souls " . Religion does play a crucial role in the film , including it's completion . Leslie Halliwell made the observation that after this film none of the stars ever did as well again . This is not true . Milland did play the evil Tony Wendice , and Macready went on to the mad French general in " Paths of Glory " . But more important , Milland kept showing his ability to stretch in the remaining decades of his life . Besides writing his interesting autobiography " Wide Eyed in Babylon " , he directed several films , he appeared in several televisions series ( one of the few stars who did not fear the new medium - and he was rewarded here too , for in the 1970s and 1980s he was still appearing while many contemporaries retired ) . Finally he capped his career as the snobbish father in " Love Story " . Actually his career is an example of just what can be accomplished if a person is not ashamed to jettison useless or outdated personalities for new ones .
492639	3280905	29811	8.0	No One Can , But the Drummer Man !	The argument is always going to pursue Hitchcock's students and fans . Were the films he made in England from 1934 to 1939 his best films ( specifically THE 39 STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES ) or were the films he made in Hollywood from STRANGERS ON A TRAIN through THE BIRDS his masterworks . I think most Americans favor the latter group , and Englishmen favor the former . Certainly he had huge budgets to play with in the 1940s to 1970s , whereas his budgets in England were terribly puny . But his basic themes got developed in his English films , and he managed to achieve some great effects on those puny budgets . YOUNG AND INNOCENT is probably frequently confused with RICH AND STRANGE , a really weird film Hitch made about four years earlier . That was about how a marriage survives an inheritance and trip around the world . This one deals with a mystery by Josephine Tey . In the 1930s to 1960s Ms Tey was the equal as a British mystery novelist of Agatha Christie , Margery Allingham , and Dorothy Sayers . This is based on A SHILLING FOR CANDLES , but most people who remember Ms Tey recall her for two novels based on historical mysteries . One , reset in modern times , is THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR ( based on the 1753 mystery of the disappearance and reappearance of Elizabeth Canning in London - a case that literally split English society as equal numbers of witnesses placed her either in a farmhouse as a prisoner , while others insisted she was living with a lover ) . The second ( and better recalled ) is THE DAUGHTER OF TIME , which tackles the question of the guilt of King Richard III in the various crimes ascribed to him by Sir Thomas More and William Shakespeare - including the murder of his two nephews . Tey's usual hero , Inspector Adam Grant , concludes history lies ( the victors determine what is " true " ) and Richard is innocent . Although it's research value is dated in 2005 , it is still a good place to start looking over Richard's reputation and case . Here the hero ( Derrick De Marney ) is suspected ( rather flimsily , actually ) of having killed a young woman on a beach . He after all helped discover the body . From the beginning we are aware of another person who is more likely to be the killer , but after a sinister opening we don't see him again . De Marney flees , and his path leads him into that of Nova Pilbeam . She was an up and coming performer of that period in England , appearing as the kidnap victim in the original THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1934 , and then as the ill-fated Lady Jane Gray in TUDOR ROSE in 1936 . Here she is the daughter of the local police head ( Percy Marmont - he had been an accidental murder victim of Peter Lorre's in 1936's THE SECRET AGENT ) . She is convinced of De Marney's innocence , and keeps helping him flee ( including a comic interlude at the home of her uncle , Basil Radford , during a birthday party . They keep looking up potentially innocent-proving evidence , and find one more ally : Edward Rigby as a helplessly entangled hobo named Will . And they do find the killer ( as does Marmont and his police ) in the conclusion , when they track him down to the drummer man - in the first really memorable use of a tracking shot by Hitch . He would next use it again in NOTORIOUS in the party scene . The man is in black face ( a racist element that was acceptable in 1937 unfortunately ) , but we know the key to his identity - his twitching eyes ( possibly nervousness , but also possibly by drugs ) . His eyes do twitch for the audience before they do for the others . And his nerves suffer the torments of the damned when he sees the police in the room and De Marney . Then he goes into a really wild drumming turn ( which his boss acidly comments on afterward ) - it is like a wild animal at bay , symbolically . It is not THE LADY VANISHES or THE 39 STEPS , but it an effective film for all that . Definitely worth watching .
493244	3280905	81377	8.0	Mark Twain's Civil War	This film was part of a series put on Channel 13 in 1980 - 1982 or so of movies based on stories or novels by Mark Twain . These included THE INNOCENCE ABROAD , THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER , THE MAN WHO CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG , and LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI . The critics , on the whole , were not enthralled by these films , feeling that the originals could not be touched , but as most of them were of relatively unused works of Twain ( unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN , TOM SAWYER , A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT , and THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ) , it was actually quite a worthy undertaking . Also it attracted some good actors . Donald Ogden Stiers appeared ( as did Barry Morse ) in THE INNOCENCE ABROAD . Fred Gwynne was in THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER . Robert Preston was in THE MAN WHO CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG . Robert Lansing was in LIFE IN THE MISSISSIPPI . And the cast of this film included Pat Hingle and Edward Herrmann . I think that after two decades in storage somewhere they should be taken out and shown again on public television . Mark Twain was born in Hannibal , Missouri , which ( during the Civil War ) was a " neutral " border state . His section was more pro-south than pro-north . He briefly joined the Confederate army with a group of his young friends , and after a few adventures ( or misadventures ) he and most of them deserted . A handful fought for the Confederate States until the end of the war . Twain , himself , accompanied his brother as a secretary to a government appointment in the Nevada territory , thus leaving the immediate theater of the war's activities . In the 1870s and 1880s a new literary form appeared in American magazines and published in book form as well : the Civil War memoirs . Twain's own Webster Publishing Co . would publish General Grant's great memoirs in 1885 , and then publish General Sheridan's , General McClellan's , and several others . General Sherman's memoirs appeared in 1876 . The Confederate Generals published too , Jubal Early , Richard Taylor , James Longstreet being three of the best writers . At one point , to spoof this trend , Twain published a long short story of the title " THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF A CAMPAIGN THAT FAILED " recounting his less than heroic adventures . It is a very informative story . He explains that he and his friends were full of the romantic ideas of Sir Walter Scott's novels about chivalry and glory , and they decided to volunteer . Unfortunately , soon after they begin , the cracks in the system pop up . Their personalities clash on certain issues ( one of the boys , named " Dunlap " shows a pretentious nature by calling himself " D'Unlap " to sound like a French knight ) . They keep falling into mud holes . They keep finding that most of the time they get lost , can't find where the real fighting is , and at one point think they hear a Yankee soldier approach , and fire . They wound a civilian , who is absolutely in shock when they try to assist him after finding out their mistake . Finally , hearing of the approach of a really overwhelming enemy force , Twain and most of the men give up and leave . It turns out the overwhelming force was one under General Ulysses Grant . The film basically follows the story , except that Pat Hingle plays a local southern sympathizer ( a farmer ) with two daughters . He is full of patriotism for the lost cause , and tries to assist the young southern patriots . But when he discovers they retreated or ran from the enemy he kicks them out in disgust . The portion of the story dealing with the wounding of the innocent traveler is changed in an interesting way . Edward Herrmann plays a local clergyman who is shot by the boys , and killed - not wounded . It is this act of total destruction of a human being ( a clergyman too - and a married one ) that leads to Twain and the others ending their military careers in the television version . But here the film actually went into a further different direction . In 1898 Twain wrote a short story called THE WAR PRAYER . Bitterly opposed to the trend towards imperialism in the U . S . , and in the Spanish American War and Philippine Insurrection , Twain's story is how at a patriotic church meeting the clergyman lauding the militarist version of the truth is confronted by a stranger who offers a new prayer for our men at war . It begs God to destroy the enemy utterly , man , woman , and child - let us grind them into itsy-bitsy pieces , etc . At the end the stranger shrieks " AMEN ! ! ! " and leaves . The shocked clergyman says nothing for a moment and then says to the congregation that the stranger must be insane . He doesn't notice that his own views are similar , but just watered down . The film ends with the ghost of Herrmann , thirty years later , wandering into a church in the period of the 1898 war . He hears the pompous , militarist clergyman glorifying the same warlike feelings that destroyed him in 1861 . Angry , Herrmann becomes the " mad " stranger , and what follows is THE WAR PRAYER in it's full effect . Wesley Addy completes this section as the self-blind clergyman . It was a very good production , and , again , I hope it is shown again some time on public television .
491846	3280905	58212	8.0	When Life Imitates Cartoon Art	This was the last of the three comedies that Jack Lemmon made in the middle 1960s that he hated . Like GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM ( and not like the abysmal UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE ) HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE had a clever script and good production . Lemmon played a successful cartoonist who carefully scripts and photos the scenes he will use in his detective adventure strip . He lives in a townhouse , complete with top rate valet ( Terry-Thomas ) and has a wonderful life as a bachelor . But while attending a stag party , he meets Verna Lisi , and takes her home . Apparently he has married her ( the groom at the stag party had broken up with his fiancé before the party , and throws the wedding ring out - and Lemmon uses it ) . As a result Lisi starts domesticating him , and Terry Thomas walks out . Lemmon uses the changes in his lifestyle in the comic strip , but finally he revolts and kills off the comic strip version of Lisi . When Lisi sees this she walks out , but everyone thinks that Lemmon killed her . So the scene is set for a murder trial . This is not a film for feminists . It takes a dim view at the effect of domestication on Lemmon ( and his lawyer , a hysterically funny Eddie Mayehoff ) . But I point out that before the end Lemmon does admit he misses the domestication . Even Terry-Thomas gives into it at the conclusion . It still a good comedy , a worthy minor work if not one of the high points in Lemmon's acting career .
491611	3280905	42994	8.0	So Who Cares About Conventions ?	I like this film . It has gotten a bad reputation due to Hitchcock's daring to break another film convention about the truth of a flashback . Hitchcock had already broken other conventions over the years , some being of a technical variety ( the nine minute uncut takes on ROPE for instance ) . Here the film begins with Richard Todd describing what he claims happened to the murdered man to ex-girl friend Jane Wyman . Subsequently we learn that the explanation is not totally true . What I find interesting about this particular issue is that the same people who denounce Hitchcock for cheating on this probably have found other films acceptable despite similar " cheating " . Take Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION . We hear Tyrone Power give Leonard Vole's version of what happened to the rich elderly woman ( Norma Varden ) , about how they met , about what he was doing on the night she was murdered . We do not SEE the actual view of his activities for the night of the murder , but we accept his comments - until the end of the film shows what happened . Also check out Kurasawa's film classic RASHOMON , where we see flashbacks of five people who show " what happened " and at the conclusion we really don't know if we heard the truth or if everyone has lied . The same can be said of the American remake of RASHOMON , THE OUTRAGE . Even a musical comedy , LES GIRLS , leaves us all guessing at the end . Yet Hitchcock was condemned for his cheating . I think he should be praised for his daring , for this film ( of all Hitchcock's movies ) develops in a unique way . Wyman is determined to prove the truth of Richard Todd's story , and keeps meeting criticism and common sense from her father , Alistair Sim , and from the police led by Michael Wilding , who don't believe him . And as a matter of fact , at the conclusion , it turns out that some , if not all of Todd's flashback has elements of truth in it . Hitchcock told Francois Truffaud that he saw STAGE FRIGHT as an opportunity to work with some great British character actors ( Sim , Joyce Grenville , Sybil Thorndyke , Kay Walsh ) . The film was definitely lower budgeted than other films ( SPELLBOUND , even THE PARADINE CASE ) that he had recently made . The most expensive aspect was working with Dietrich which was costly for her salary and her designer clothing . But Hitchcock wanted a chance to work with Dietrich here ( just like he had made MR . AND MRS . SMITH to work with Carole Lombard in 1939 ) . The results were quite good . The British character actors did the most with their parts ( including Todd , who shows a nervousness and uncertainty in most of the film that is suggestive of possible insanity at the end ) . Dietrich also , in her closing moments on the screen , shows a bitterness and hatred that I don't think she ever showed in any other film role . Jane Wyman was criticized by Hitchcock for insisting on dressing up as the film progressed . However she does show a resourcefulness and pluck not usually seen in most of her movies . On the whole the film works pretty well to me .
492390	3280905	25520	8.0	The Boulevard of Broken Dreams	This is one of those movies that are somewhat better than they deserve to be - not great but reasonably entertaining . Franchot Tone is a composer of popular music working for impresario Tullio Carminati . Tone is married to Constance Bennett , who was once part of a singing duet that was very successful . He wants Connie to be a house frau , and she is burning to show her stuff again on stage ( only as a single this time ) . Now this situation sounds very familiar - it was a theme on I LOVE LUCY back in the 1950s where Desi Arnaz had his star crazed wife Lucille Ball try to get into his nightclub show repeatedly . But there Ball had no talent ( or rarely showed her talent ) when she auditioned . Here Bennett does have the talent ( as Carminati notes ) . ( Ironically , Ball is in this film , along with Barbara Pepper , as two of the chorus girls . By the way , the film is set in New York City , but the review is using " Raquel " , a singer from the Moulin Rouge - hence the title . ) Fed up with Tone's patronizing ( if loving ) refusal to have her perform , Bennett walks out on him . But she learns her old partner " Raquel " from Paris is coming to headline Carminati's new show . Bennett goes to see her and we see that Bennett is playing a dual role here - " Raquel " is Bennett in her normal blond hair , with a French accent ( rightly compared on another review on this thread to Fifi D'Orsay ) . Raquel and Bennett agree to switch places ( Raquel knows the tunes in the review already as does Bennett ) and the former goes off with a boyfriend ( Ivan Lebedeff ) to Atlantic City , while the latter takes on the role in the show with dyed hair . Of course the complications are that Bennett makes a sexual hit with Carminati and Tone as " Raquel " . In Carminati's case the surface situation is not unusual and might lead somewhere ( except for one secret he , Tone , and Bennett are not aware of - " Raquel " is married to a French man ( George Renevent ) who suddenly shows up to reclaim his wife ) . In Tone's case it is leading to adulterous passions that conflict with his real love for Bennett in her actual role as his wife . As for Bennett she is in conflict as the rival of herself for her husband's ( Tone's ) affection - much to the caustic disgust of Bennett's friend and assistant Helen Westley . The rather silly plot is like several other films . One thinks of the willing substitution of twins in dramas like THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER or THE PRISONER OF ZENDA or in comedies like ON THE RIVIERA , ON THE DOUBLE , and WONDER MAN ( all with Danny Kaye in dual roles ) . The fate of a character in disguise becoming his own rival was used again later in IRMA LA DOUCE by Jack Lemmon . The pretending to be a French performer and changing hair color is in the contemporary EVERY DAY'S A HOLIDAY with Mae West . Oddly enough a change in blond to brunette color would soon lead to a film career extension in a movie . Joan Bennett would have to change her hair to brunette in TRADE WINDS a few years later , discover she looked like Hedy Lamarr that way , and retain the brunette look for the rest of her career . Despite the silly plot , the script is good with much humor that the Breen Office and Hollywood Code would shortly do away with . Tone and Carminati chasing " Raquel " towards the end during the show walk into stagehands carrying scenery ( two out houses labeled " His " and " Hers " is an example ) . Some criticism of the sex comedy must have been noted in production - Lebedeff's scenes are mostly gone , and we see nothing of " Raquel " in Atlantic City with him . The best thing about the film is the Dubin and Warren tunes , particularly " Kisses in the Morning / Coffee in the Evening " and " The Boulevard of Broken Dreams " . The latter is a fifteen minute musical number ( the conclusion of the review ) in which we see how " Raquel's " character in the review scene ended up as a prostitute ) . The former was a duet with the ill-fated Russ Columbo which shows his voice in good form , and notes he was quite good looking and photogenic - he would have had a good film career had he lived . It too ends on a sexual joke that manages to get by censorship , showing what too much kissing in the evening can lead to . I also note a nice running gag in the film wherein Carminati is trying to catch up with Bennett as her real self or as the French " Raquel " , and ends up being confronted by perennially drunk and belligerent Hobart Cavanagh , until the conclusion when the normally good mannered Carminati has enough and decks Hobart . It almost makes the film entertaining by itself .
491851	3280905	26266	9.0	A Good Version of a Classic	This version of David COPPERFIELD is quite a good one , in that it does trim the 800 plus page novel down to reasonable coherence . There are some characters that one misses , but they are understandably cut due to length considerations . While Steerforth and his betrayal of the Peggoty Family is in the film ( including the dual tragedy at it's conclusion ) , the sub-story of Little Em'ly's friend Martha and the business regarding Steerforth's mother , Rosa Dartle , and Mrs . Mowcher were dumped ( Mrs . Mowcher would have been hard to cast ) . Pity , Mrs . Mowcher's famous speech to David about not confusing her physical attributes with her mental ones is missing . Also Steerforth's butler Littimer appears once , but the film does not get into the ironic coda of his imprisonment . While Uriah Heep's villainy against Mr . Wickfield and his clients is shown , his willingness to dig up dirt against other " enemies " is not shown . In particular his treatment of Dr . Strong ( David's second schoolmaster ) , his young wife , and Jack Dalton is not developed ( which is sad as it proves Mr . Dick is not simple minded ) . But those are minor points really . The best jobs in the film are the work of the performers under George Cukor's direction : Edna Mae Oliver as the crusty , wise Aunt Betsy ; Roland Young as the evil , greasy Uriah Heep ( his best villain part ) ; and W . C . Fields as Wilkins McCawber ( Dicken's tribute to his lovable but improvident father ) is superb - the one time his comic personae met the proper dramatic role ; and Lionel Barrymore as Dan Pegotty determined to find his lost , ruined niece . Freddy Bartholemew's performance as young David is wonderful . But I must admit that Frank Lawson is a trifle colorless as the grown up David ( although he has a funny moment at a dinner that Dora ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) tries to prepare ) . It is a weakness but a small weakness in a nearly perfect film .
492706	3280905	32671	9.0	Ginger's Oscar and a worthy one .	Although a little dated today , KITTY FOYLE actually stands up well . It was based on a best selling novel by Christopher Morley . Morley wrote other novels ( PARNASSUS ON WHEELS is about a bookmobile and the adventures of its owners ) , but is best recalled for this novella and for helping to found the American Sherlock Holmes fan club " The Baker Street Irregulars " . Setting the novel in Philadelphia ( although from Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania , Morley grew up in Baltimore , and later lived in New York State - his cabin is in a park out on Long Island ) , he tells a story of a young , determined woman ( Ginger Rogers ) who is from the wrong side of town . She lives on Griscom Street , near the train tracks . But she loves to read of the lives of the wealthy mainliners . Her father ( Ernest Cossart ) tries to make her see reality , but she wants to believe that wishes and fantasies can come true . Kitty ironically is introduced by her father to Wyn Stratford ( Dennis Morgan ) a struggling magazine writer and owner . He is a " Main Liner " , scion of a wealthy Quaker banking fortune . The story follows Kitty over a period of seven years , and her relationship with Wyn and with Mark ( James Craig ) , a doctor from New York City . The two men are competing for her love , but Wyn has the initial advantage as her first love . But as time passes he lives up to the warning description that Kitty's father gives about " Main Liners " : they end up returning to their social class for wives , and not rocking the boat . Wyn nearly does break free - he marries Kitty briefly . But his fine words of determination to stick it out with her in New York without the benefit of the trust funds that keep him very comfortable are just that . . . words . Kitty also has the tragedy of giving birth to a son , and losing the son . The story is one of those " sandwich " types that begin with the current life of Kitty , and how she has a chance to either marry Mark or run off with Wyn . We then see the whole past history of Kitty , and are not told until the final moment which of the two she will go with . Despite elements of tragedy , the film is not totally a downer . The scene where Wyn and Kitty go to a speakeasy run by Giono ( Eduardo Cianelli ) who is predicting the victory of Herbert Hoover over FDR on election night 1932 is funny as he keeps refusing to see the obvious ( that the votes are going into the Democratic column far more completely than they have in decades ) . Kitty's introduction to Mark ( she pretends to faint when she sets off a fire alarm ) and their boring first date ( a test to see if she is only after a good time , and not serious about dating ) are quite funny . So is her meeting with Wyn's family , headed by his mother ( Gladys Cooper ) , uncle ( Walter Kingsford in a white hair wig ) , and grandmother ( Cecilia Cunningham ) , where she finds that Wyn jumped the gun and that they wanted to send Kitty to a finishing school . When I watched the film I was aware that my mother used to visit relatives in Philadelphia during the depression quite frequently . She liked going to Wanamakers , where they had cocoa or coffee and sandwiches . I could see how the atmosphere of the film certainly remains true to that period , when social classes were so much stricter . Dated , but still a fine film for all that . One final point . This film was made in 1940 , and one running point is the snow globe that Kitty is looking at and reminiscing about . It fell from her father when he dies alone in their Philadelphia home , and she constantly looks at the snow as it falls within the globe . I wonder if Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz both saw this bit and decided to use it for the start of CITIZEN KANE the following year , where the snow globe the dying Kane holds and drops ( and breaks ) has a sled reminding him of Rosebud . Both movies were ( after all ) from RKO films .
492406	3280905	91605	9.0	Movies on medieval theological problems and history fail in Peoria	For the last three years we have been under the effect of the novel THE DA VINCI CODE , which swept the world's best seller lists , and then was finally turned into a film . It dealt with the so called secret writings of coded messages that are to be found in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci , and which deals with a hidden secret that the Roman Catholic supposedly has hidden . The film was a flop in the United States Some twenty one years ago a similar phenomenon hit the U . S . and Europe . The Italian , Umberto Eco , wrote a complex novel about the early 15th Century in Italy , the Roman Catholic Church , the rise of the great monastic libraries , and the rise of the inquisition . THE NAME OF THE ROSE became the great best seller of the middle years of the 1980s . It was made into a film starring Sean Connery , F . Murray Abraham , and Christian Slater . And the film flopped in the United States , but was successful in Europe . The events of THE NAME OF THE ROSE occur about the year 1410 in North Italy . A series of murders occur in a monastery that has one of the finest libraries . The abbot calls his old friend , the humanistic William of Baskerville ( Connery ) to assist in finding out what happened - if the murders are by human hand or the work ( as some have said ) of the devil . William comes with his young acolyte assistant Adso of Melk ( Christian Slater ) , and slowly finds he is facing two enemies . One is the murderer who is in the monastery , and whose motives are unknown . The other is an old enemy , the fanatical inquisitor Bernardo Gui ( F . Murray Abraham ) . Gui has had a previous run-in with William over a man William defended . William was tortured until he renounced his defense , and the man was executed . But in Gui's closed , evil mind once you defend a condemned heretic you are a marked man if you raise your head up again . The film follows William's struggle to solve the mystery and evade his old enemy's threats . It also follows Adso's romance with a local girl ( Valentina Vargas ) who shared his moment of love in the novel . In the end William does find the killer , but at a cost - the loss of the great library . Eco's novel , because it was a novel , could go into greater detail for the reader than the film could . While one picture is worth a thousand words , unless you read thousands of words you will not know what to look for in the picture . In Europe , where the medieval world is not too far from the modern in some cities ( those that were not flattened in the two world wars , like Prague ) , one had the education to follow the story and see the ironies in the tale . 1410 is an ironic date , and few Americans understood that . In 1410 the Roman Catholic Church's center of operations was not Rome . Most Americans have never heard of the " Avignon Papacy " , which began in 1360 and lasted sixty years ( until 1420 ) . The French monarchy , in a moment of anger at a Pope , invaded Italy and grabbed his Holiness and brought him back to Avignon with the Papal Curia . This would mean that from now on the Papacy would be an adjunct to the French throne , and the rest of Western Christian Europe resented it . But nothing was done about it for decades . By 1410 , to the French it looked like Avignon would be permanent . That year a movement began to sweep Europe . In Bohemia a reformer , Jan Huss , arose and created a national Christian church . This was fought by Avignon , and the inquisition was created to combat it . It did eventually kill Huss , in 1416 , after a show trial . But the Hussites survived ( and actually formed the first reformation - beating Martin Luther by a century ) . But worst was to come . The enemies of Avignon picked up on this heresy and said it was proof that the French Pope was the anti-pope . Soon there were two other Papal courts in Italy that excommunicated each other and Avignon . But after awhile the two Italian Popes realized how absurd the situation made the Church look in the eyes of the world . So they sent representatives to meet , and they created a joint resolution ( and a new jointly recognized Italian Pope - with backing from the rest of Europe ) . Avignon was declared heretical - and the newly created machinery of the inquisition turned upon the original creators . After 1420 Avignon was an unpleasant memory ( only revived as a threat first by Napoleon in the early 1800s and later by Hitler in World War II to control - if necessary - the Curia and the Pope in Rome ) . The irony of this is not noted by American audiences as much by European ones . If Gui had not died in the film ( well merited as it is ) he would have switched sides and gone after his former French masters . Also not noted is that the final irony of the story is the title - the " rose " is the young woman Adso loves and sleeps with . He never learns her name . The acting of Connery and Slater is fine , as is the performance of the doomed " heretic " ( who has been feeding the locals against the Church's orders ) Helmut Qualtinger . Abraham makes Gui a contemptible bully , but he does occasionally rant too much ( though that is easy given the bully's nature ) . His death sequence is ironic too , as he tries to get help in his precarious situation from the peasants who know he killed their friends - he begs for their assistance and they don't come . Also note Fyodor Chailapin Jr ( son of the great opera basso ) , as the blind monk . Certainly a fine performance for this elderly actor , best recalled for the dog-loving grandfather in MOONSTRUCK .
491596	3280905	45296	9.0	America's Favorite Foreign Revolution ?	The history of Mexico , our southern neighbor ( and sometimes victim ) is better known to American movie goers than the history of most countries . You begin with the Maya ( KINGS OF THE SUN ) , the conquest of Mexico ( THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE ) , then to the founding of Father Serra's missions in California ( SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD ) , and then the Spanish in the southwest and California ( THE MARK OF ZORRO ) . Mexican - American history begins with the Texas War for Independence ( THE ALAMO , THE LAST TEXAN , etc . ) . We skip to the French " intervention " : JUAREZ and VERA CRUZ . Then we tend to skip the long reign of Porfirio Diaz . Then comes the Mexican Revolution . The number of films that deal with the revolution is vast . But here are just a few titles : VIVA ZAPATA , VIVA VILLA , VILLA RIDES , THE OLD GRINGO ( about Ambrose Bierce's probable death in Mexico's revolution ) , VIVA MARIA ( a spoof but it touches on some issues ) , THE THREE AMIGOS , THEY CAME TO CORDURA ( regarding the American Intervention under General Pershing in 1916 ) , THE FUGITIVE ( dealing with the anti-Catholic policies of the 1920s and 1930s ) , and even THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES ( when you see the business with Alfonso Badoya's bandit gang against the Federales ) . The Mexican Revolution had many heroes . Many were heroes for one group but devils to another . Madero and Carranza stressed the need to have a nation that was loyal to a written constitution . Zapata would be one of the leaders of the land reform movement . Starting with Francisco Madero , going through Pancho Villa and Eufremio Zapata , going to their enemy Venusiano Carranza , to Obregon , Calles , and the great land reformer Lazaro Cardenas - the leadership was varied . The largest concentration of films is on the colorful ( and murderous ) Villa ( a recent cable television movie was about Villa and his contract with D . W . Griffith to shoot a movie , AND STARRING PANCHO VILLA ) . But historians usually feel that while Villa tended to be on the side of the peasants , he had too much of the bandit in him to be a leader of the revolution's reforms . Zapata , on the other hand actually tried to reform the division of land . His work never got as far as he wanted before he was assassinated , but it was burned into the souls of the people from his region of Mexico ( who still call themselves Zapatistas when involved in political protests to this day ) , and it did help set the stage for Cardenas ' reforms in the late 1930s . With direction by Elia Kazan and screenplay by John Steinbeck , VIVA ZAPATA is a wonderful , if simplistic view of the Revolution for American audiences . Brando underplays the lead for the most part - Zapata was not an explosive personality like Villa . Anthony Quinn is the explosive brother , whose more selfish attitudes leads to his own disaster . Of the supporting players , Alan Reed is good in his scene as Villa , where he discusses the future of Mexico with Zapata . Joseph Wiseman is properly sinister as an constant malcontent agent provocateur , insinuating each leader is too weak or unreliable to lead . There are great set pieces - like Kazan's symbolic assassination of Madero by General Huerta's goons who drown out the little reformer / orator's voice as he tries to scream with a siren ( but it makes the screams of the unheard martyr like a clarion call to Mexico ) . Is it real Mexican history ? Not quite - it is a version of it . But it is a really well done version of it .
491759	3280905	104452	9.0	If One Has To Choose Between an Unpleasant Tasting Truth and a Moving Lie , Choose the Lie !	It's not the most memorable comedy with either of it's two stars , nor did it get more than mediocre reviews when it came out , but HOUSESITTER is actually quite an interesting comedy . It certainly is much more than the one joke everyone who critiqued the film jumped on . At the start of the film , Newton Davis ( Steve Martin ) is taking his long-time fiancé ( Becky Medcalf - Dana Delany ) on a car ride where Becky is blindfolded . Newton has promised her a surprise . He drives her to the surprise , and she takes off the blindfold . It is a two story , specially designed private home that he has built for her , and has even put a huge ribbon around for her to pull off while he proposes marriage to her . The house with the ribbon around it is the joke that was pinpointed by the critics as the best gag - and it was done too early they claimed . Actually it was done pretty well . For Becky is speechless , until she explains to Newton that she wants an end to their dating and sexual relationship . As this ignores the expense and time of Newton in creating and building that house , her announcement that their relationship is over demolishes him . Returning to Boston and feeling dejected , Newton goes to a dinner at a Hungarian Restaurant in honor of the head of the architectural firm ( Roy Cooper ) that ends in quasi-disaster when Newton gets his boss angry . As he tries to pick up the tatters he has left , he talks to a waitress named Gwen Philips ( Goldie Hawn ) and mentions the house he's built . Gwen ( who has had problems with her boss , which has just cost her her apartment ) , realizes that Newton has given her a possible place to reside in for awhile . So she moves to the house . And she soon is acquiring credit with various local townspeople claiming that she and Newton have married and she's setting up the house . Newton also heads for the house , debating on when he can sell it or tear it down . He's surprised to get dozens of congratulations for his marriage , and when he confronts Gwen she offers him a deal . He still wants to win back Becky ( who is astonished that he has gotten married so quickly ) . Gwen will remain his " wife " as long as possible for him to make Becky jealous and willing to marry Newton ( once he gets a " divorce " ) . It's interesting to compare this fake marriage with INDISCREET , CACTUS FLOWER , and OVERBOARD . In the first Cary Grant made up a non-existent wife so he could have an " above-board " romance with no strings attached with Ingrid Bergman , but when she learns of it she teaches him a lesson by pretending she's been carrying on with an old flame . In the second Walter Matthau invents a non-existent wife for a similar reason to romance Goldie Hawn , but when she reveals the depth of her love for him coupled with her insistence that her husband has to be truthful , Matthau has to make his nurse / receptionist ( again Ingrid Bergman ) his " wife " in order to create an " amicable divorce " . In OVERBOARD , after being abandoned by conniving husband Edward Herrmann , amnesiac sufferer Goldie Hawn is convinced by her " husband " Kurt Russell that she is the mother of his sons . Here the so-called " wife " sets up the situation for her own benefit , and her so-called husband goes along because it will enable him to reunite ( maybe ) with his original lover . What I find particularly fascinating in HOUSESITTER is that as the movie unfurls , and there are more and more stories that have to be created to give a background to the " marriage " of Gwen and Newton , more and more people on the periphery get drawn in , and even when they have doubts about the stories end up not only affirming they are true , but seemingly embracing them . The best example is Richard Schull and Laurel Cronin as Ralph and Mary . Both are middle aged derelicts who know Gwen ( who helped give them food near the restaurant ) . When Newton's parents ( Donald Moffett and Julie Harris ) want to meet Gwen's parents , she brings in Ralph and Mary . This includes cleaning them off , draining them of their alcoholic haze , and giving them clothes . Ralph soon falls into line - he likes having a nice daughter . He also talks about his services in World War II . And since he and Mary are cleaned now , he is showing more consideration to his old fellow drunkard , and she's starts embracing the lies . Later , there is a dinner party at the new house , and Newton's boss is among the guests ( he is very impressed at the way Newton designed the house ) . It turns out the boss was in the theater of war that Ralph was claiming he was in . At first the boss is doubting this , but as the evening goes on he starts embracing the idea that Ralph was not only there , but fighting side-by-side with him against the Japanese ! They are not the only ones . It actually hits every character as the film continues because everyone realizes the lies are more pleasant than the truth . And the last one to learn this is Newton - just watch his moment of " lie " when comparing Gwen and Becky and realizing which of the two is really worth more . I don't think there is any other comedy where truth took such a beating before or since .
492680	3280905	92148	9.0	Slightly Superior Remake of a Clever Television Mystery	In 1976 Jack Klugman , James Franciscus , and Elizabeth Ashley made a clever television mystery , ONE OF MY WIVES IS MISSING , which is about a weird extortion scheme by an impostor . It was remade ( in my opinion slightly better ) in 1986 with Elliot Gould , Mike Farrell , and Margot Kidder in the lead roles . I say better because , while the supporting cast of ONE OF MY WIVES IS MISSING , was good , this remake had Fred Gwynne in a pivotal role as a somewhat shady clergyman - an ally of Kidder's in her scheme . There was also a nice bit by that underrated supporting actor Graham Jarvis ( MARY HARTMAN , MARY HARTMAN ) as a holistic doctor who gets dragged into the mystery . Finally the writer / producers in this were the creators of Lt . Columbo , William Link and Richard Levinson . They improved the script a bit , particularly with Gwynne's role . The story is the same - Farrell is the newlywed husband who had an argument with his wife , and she left their cabin in high dudgeon . When he reports this to officer Elliot Gould , suddenly the door opens and Kidder comes in begging Farrell's forgiveness for the argument and her snit . But Farrell insists she is a fake . Gould , thinking he's been the victim of a joke , leaves disgusted . And then Kidder reveals her larcenous demands on Farrell unless he wishes to have serious problems with the law . Farrell , forced to go along with her demands , keeps looking for a chance to get Gould to come back and investigate a bit more . But when Gould reappears a " witness " shows up to support Kidder - a Catholic clergyman played by Gwynne . Of course once Gould leaves again , Farrell faces now two extortionists working some badger game on him . Again the tension is maintained by a good cast and the improved dialog of the script . What is going on ? Where is Farrell's wife , and what have Kidder and Gwynne done with her ? Will Jarvis , who has stumbled into the mystery accidentally , help Farrell overcome these villains ? And what is Gould up to . . . for he to begins acting oddly after awhile ? Again the ending catches the viewer by surprise ( unless they saw the original television film ) . Certainly worth catching if it is shown again as one of the best television mystery films .
492447	3280905	60522	9.0	The Caper of the Cellini Venus	This is a charming comedy that is solely to entertain the audience . It's cast certainly helps the story immensely . Historically Benvenuto Cellini is remembered as the author of one of the classic autobiographies of all times . But he was also a great gold and silversmith - but tragically only one or two of his wonderful works still exist . He was also a sculptor , his best statue being one of Perseus holding the head of Medusa . Yet , in Paris is the home of Hugh Griffin , a wealthy man with a great private collector . He has another piece by Cellini - a miniature of a naked Venus . It is one of the gems of Griffin's collection , and he is always showing his friends and customers to see it . Customers ? Well , every now and then if a fellow collector is willing to talk big money Griffin will sell a piece from his collection to the man or woman . This has led to some problems . Art specialist and detective Charles Boyer is aware that some collectors who have dealt with Griffin subsequently were less than happy for their expensive purchases - they seem to be fake . But none are willing to go to court and look like greedy fools . So , Boyer sends out his best operative , Peter O'Toole , to observe Griffin and see if he can find anything . Griffin , in the meantime has bitten off more than he can chew . It seems that he is being constantly pursued by Fernand Gravet of the Louvre to let them display the Cellini on a loan . He has kept putting Gravet off claiming he fears something may damage the rare piece . But at the same time he is encouraging the collecting greed of wealthy Eli Wallach , and promising he may sell the great statue . But by a fluke , Griffin makes the mistake of agreeing to allow Gravet's great wish . So the statue is taken to the museum , and then Griffin realizes the disaster he has opened . For insurance purposes the Louvre insists on having the statue examined by experts . Griffin does not want them to see that . His daughter is Audrey Hepburn , and he confesses to her that he has followed the family tradition of artistically excellent forgeries , that would pass the eyes of most people as real , but not the real experts . His huge income is due to selling suckers these copies . Now , he might end his days in jail once the statue is examined . But Wallach does not know this . He still wants an in with Griffin , and he hopes to do this by offering marriage to a stunned Hepburn . But if he could get ownership of the Venus ( which he would be willing to keep in his private vault in America ) he'd reconsider marriage to Hepburn . Hepburn begins noticing O'Toole's observations about the neighborhood . Soon he starts noticing her more than her father . As their romance spreads they both reveal what they are up to . And join forces to get the statue back without Griffin being involved , and to put it into the hands of Wallach to make sure nobody ever sees it again . The twenty minute robbery at the Louvre is a very funny session , dealing with hiding in a broom closet , using a boomerang toy , and repeatedly demonstrating the new museum security system has flaws in it . This brings in the supporting performance of Moustache ( the fat French comedian ) as ( ultimately ) the most surprised museum guard involved in the the testing of that system . An anonymous cameo by a very , very important French figure ( of Paris in 1966 ) is the final key to the success of the robbery . Will it be pulled off or won't it ? Will Wallach marry Hepburn , or will he find another woman to fall for ? And will Griffin learn his lesson ? Delightful all the way .
492115	3280905	25948	9.0	" Johnny , what ' d I do wrong ? "	Wallace Beery was a complicated man . He was ( from what I have read of him ) a nasty customer in many ways - he skirted the edge of the law on several occasions . But he was an entertaining performer , in both drama ( CHINA SEAS , THE CHAMP ) or comedy ( DINNER AT EIGHT , A DATE WITH JUDY ) . Although his Oscar ( in the first tie vote in Academy history - with Fredric March in DR . JECKYL AND MR . HYDE ) was for THE CHAMP , in some ways his most sympathetic role was as Pancho Villa in VIVA VILLA . It is rather curious that this film , the first really serious sound film to study the Mexican Revolution , picked up on Villa as the hero , rather than Francisco Madero , the original leader of the revolution in 1910 . Madero appears in the film ( played by Henry B . Walthall , in a good performance ) , but it is Villa's story ( or what passes for it ) . He was more colorful than the unfortunate Madero , now best recalled for his murder in 1913 by General Huerta . Villa was a highly successful bandit ( a model for Alfonso Badoya's great bandit in THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES ) , who did support some amount of social reform for the lower classes - but he never was as committed to it as his southern rival Zapata . In fact , when Villa finally ended fighting the government , he retired to a large landed estate he had acquired . But he had great color . . . for good or bad . On one occasion he was giving an interview to a newspaperman , when he noted a drunken soldier who was making too much noise , so that he could not hear the newsman's questions . Quietly , without looking vicious or nasty , Villa took out his gun and shot and killed the soldier . He then resumed the interview with the horrified newsman . Villa was like that . He considered his killing someone like that natural . He was an odd man , very childlike at times , very cunning ( to a point rather clever as a military strategist ) , and highly murderous when angered . He loved women , and would " marry " many to satisfy their scruples if they hesitated having sex with him . This led Theodore Roosevelt to make the rather loopy comment that Villa was an evil murderer and bigamist . Villa was also the last man in history ( prior to Osama Ben Laden's tools ) to attack the continental United States . Angered that President Woodrow Wilson stopped supporting him and his men in 1916 , Villa attacked Columbus , New Mexico , killing several Americans . The failure of the Carranza government to arrest or catch Villa led Wilson to blunder into Mexican affairs by sending General John Pershing and a large armed force into northern Mexico to catch Villa . Villa led Pershing a merry chase , and finally the Americans had to withdraw in humiliation . Actually that was his highpoint as a public figure . Within two years his army was in ruins and he had to surrender to the government forces . He retired to his ranch , only to be assassinated by personal enemies in 1923 . Beery was not the only actor to play Villa . Yul Brynner and Telly Savalas both played the role in films too . But the Beery film is best in making the Mexican into a tragic hero . He is an overgrown child , who needs a father figure to bring out his best side ( briefly found in Madero ) , and does not fully know when he does wrong . But he also has a sense of right and wrong : witness his willingness to humiliate himself before his enemy General Pascal ( Joseph Schildkraut ) , to save lives - only to find that Madero has pardoned him already . Later , when he learns that Madero was betrayed and murdered by Pascal , he captures the General and gives the latter a brutal punishment , but one that the audience fully supports . His friendship with the John Reed character ( Stu Erwin as Johnny Sykes ) shows that he was capable of being a more reasonable man , but was troubled by his behavior and his failures . He never did fully deliver the reforms to Mexico that he had pledged Madero he would bring . In the end , as he lays dying , Sykes is there to comfort him - telling him how Mexico will honor his memory . But he dies crying the line in the " summary " line above - what had he done wrong indeed ! Not the historic Villa , but a worthy portrait of a fascinating man .
493248	3280905	35417	9.0	The Law and Life : Striking a Perfect Balance	Cary Grant has a curious role in this film - he is a labor agitator . He has been stirring up matters in his native town against the local big business factory , owned by Charles Dingle . Then , there is a fire at the factory - an arson fire . Grant is suspected and arrested for the arson ( and subsequently for the murder of Tom Tyler , the factory foreman who is missing and presumed dead ) . Grant manages to escape capture , and heads for the home of one of his oldest friends - Jean Arthur . What he does not realize is that Arthur has rented the house for the summer to a law professor of note , Ronald Colman . Arthur is willing to hide Grant in the attic , but Colman does arrive , only to find that the sheriff and a pack of hounds are at his door ( and due to some unexpected clothing switching the hounds chase Colman up a tree ) . Starting with this situation , THE TALK OF THE TOWN blossoms into a neat little comedy triangle that tackles the issues of what is law , and what do we expect of it ? Colman's Professor Lightcap is a quiet judicial scholar - a man of books . Probably too many books . Later in the film , Grant's Leopold Dilg tells Arthur's Nora Shelley that he's looked at the legal tomes Colman reads ( and upon which his judicial philosophy is based ) and they are intelligent , comprehensible , " and dead . " Colman , in short , is a legal conservative , and so has a tendency to support the status quo . He is also an appointee ( awaiting confirmation ) to the U . S . Supreme Court . All this is hardly promising for Grant and Arthur , who hope that Colman can assist them in saving Grant from prison or worse . Grant's attempts at getting Colman into the real world is limited by his inability to appear in public ( he is a wanted man , after all ) . But Arthur , and Grant's attorney Edgar Buchanan , are capable to take Colman around the town and make him realize that Grant has not been given a fair chance to defend himself . The film concentrates on Colman's slowly becoming a realist - seeing that the opinions of one hundred years of precedents are not the be all or end all of justice . It begins when he meets Dingle , and then the trial judge ( who seems all too prejudiced against Grant before the trial - not to mention too chummy with the owner of the factory ) . As he comes down to earth , he even strips himself of his badge of ivory tower-ism - his beard , which he shaves off ( much to the distress of his valet , played by a subdued but funny Rex Ingram ) . I leave it to the viewers to see how Colman eventually does get Grant out of his legal difficulties . The movie is one of the few ( up to that date in the 1940s ) that looked at the legal system critically . The massive dislike of the townspeople towards Grant ( where they all have been financially hurt by the factory fire they blame on him ) makes a fair trial in that town impossible . It reminds us of the issue nowadays about media coverage of crimes where local jury pools get tainted by prejudgments of defendants thrust down their throats . Yet Colman is warned by his political friends to avoid involvement - to keep himself clean before he is confirmed . You wonder what is the value of a seat on the Supreme Court if the would-be judge cannot make sure that justice is even handed and as near pure as possible . To me TALK OF THE TOWN may not be a great film but it is above average , and an unusual one for both male leads - for Grant in his character's personality , and for Colman for his gradual concentration less on his rivalry with Grant over Arthur as with the battle for justice . Before TWELVE ANGRY MEN came out over a decade later , TALK OF THE TOWN was the best movie about the philosophy and reality of the law ( except for THE OX-BOW INCIDENT ) Hollywood produced .
492473	3280905	197270	9.0	The first Philosopher we all tend to recall the name of . . .	He is the first and best known philosopher , as his pupils Plato and Xenophon would have wanted it , but he is also the only " great " philosopher who never wrote anything or constructed his own theory . In fact , Socrates ( fascinating man that he was ) was really the inventor of a method of inquiry , and the man who became the mouthpiece of a great philosopher , his friend and disciple Plato . We know much about Socrates because of Plato and Xenophon ( and a few later writers who had access to sources now lost to us ) . He also was a friend of Aristophanes ( who spoofed him in THE CLOUDS ) , and is mentioned for distinguishing himself in some heavy fighting at a land battle in the Pelopponesian War by the historian Thucydides . It does show that in his own time ( roughly 450 - 399 B . C . E . ) he was a well known public figure . But his fame was secured by his death . He died literally because of his faith in his city-state's laws and decisions , even if they were deadly for him . Because Plato and Xenophon were politically conservative types , even elitists , one can assume that Socrates too was one . But he was inquisitive , and constantly asked question after question about the philosophical issue or point of behavior under discussion . The " Socratic method " remains the favored method of philosophers , but it is also the key to legal confrontation in court . You never accept a statement without testing it , or seeing where it goes . It was Plato who took his teacher's method in the various dialogs to include his own views on society in THE REPUBLIC and THE LAWS , or on love and friendship ( THE SYMPOSIUM ) or on the issue of goodness or whatever issue would occupy Plato's attention . But the Socratic method also makes enemies . Most of the sophists or rival teachers of Socrates who are Plato's straw men resented being made to look like fools by Socrates . When several of his students and friends were among the anti-Democrats who helped Sparta win the Peloponnesian War and to conquer Athens , they took their first opportunity to have Socrates arrested for " impiety " . This was tantamount to a treason charge . Socrates had long talked of a small voice that spoke to him at times . This suggested a rival to the official gods of the city of Athens ( although Socrates never said it was ) . The result was that Socrates was convicted by an Athenian jury . He was asked if he could suggest his punishment ( it should have been death ) . He gave a speech , and suggested some trivial punishment . The jury decided to condemn him to death . He had one month left , and his friends insisted that he flee . He refused - he would not fight the laws of the city state he loved . So he was given a goblet of the poison hemlock , and died after drinking it . Plato wrote four short dialogs giving the trial of Socrates ( including the speech the " Apology " ) Socrates gave to the jury . The trial ( the first great historic trial in western civilization ) has been written , analyzed , and discussed ever since . Plato's later REPUBLIC was designed to protect a future Socrates from a stupid judicial murder . Plato's disciple Aristotle left Athens after a political error almost led to his trial and death ( he said he would not enable Athens to repeat a historic mistake again ) . Yet the drama of Socrates ' demise never became the subject of a major drama or movie , except this one time . In the late 1950s Maxwell Anderson wrote the play BAREFOOT IN ATHENS ( Socrates walked without sandals ) . A late play , it has less of Anderson self-indulgence in it than most of his works and can be revived . This is probably because all he has to do is turn to the ancient writers to get his story and structure of the dialog . His only innovations is the development of the character of Socrates ' wife Xanthippe ( historically a shrew ) , and his relationship with the Spartan King . Socrates befriends the King of Sparta , who has slowly found that defeating Athens just unloads a huge number of problems into his lap . He has little trust of the small men who would run Athens now ( the generation of leaders personified by Pericles is long gone ) . But Socrates keeps arguing for the restoration of the city's democracy . Of course this will guarantee his own doom , but he is a patriot . Ustinov was perfect casting as Socrates , physically looking like the fat , slightly homely , and bearded Greek . His high points ( that I recall ) were when he begs the King of Sparta to restore Athenian democracy , when he defends himself at his trial , and when he tries to comfort the difficult Xanthippe ( Geraldine Page ) who does , for all her sharp tongue , love him dearly . It was a worthy production , and until a full movie is made of it this is the only dramatization of this historical tragedy .
493276	3280905	29442	9.0	A Colman - Selznick triumph	Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins was a successful London barrister , who got his measure of permanent fame as the author of several novels . Some were quite popular in their day , like " The Dolly Dialogues " and " The Man In The Car " ( which bases it's central figure on Cecil Rhodes ) . But it is his two " Ruritanian " Romances , " The Prisoner Of Zenda " and " Rupert Of Hentzau " that are the main novels he is recalled for , especially " The Prisoner Of Zenda " . Set in a middle European kingdom , it was ( for it's day in the last decades of the 19th Century ) an updating of the swashbuckling novels of Alexandre Dumas . Dumas had some stories set in " modern Europe " ( " The Count Of Monte Cristo " is set in the period of 1815 - 1830 , and was written in 1844 - 1845 ) , but most were in earlier periods , such as the 16th , 17th , and 18th Centuries . Hope Hawkins ( who wrote under the name Anthony Hope ) figured that there was sufficient intrigue and deviltry in modern Europe to transplant the plot style to the 1870s - 1890s . And there was considerable intrigue , especially in Eastern Europe . In the 1880s Prince Alexander of Battenberg seemed set to become first Prince or King of Bulgaria . He had won admiration in Europe for his stunning victories over the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia in a war of 1885 ( the war that was the background to Shaw's ARMS AND THE MAN ) , and was poised to get his crown , when the Russian Empire balked . They thought Alexander was too pro-German , and too close ( due to family relationships ) to Great Britain . So Alexander was toppled , and forced to leave Bulgaria under very humiliating circumstances . Eventually Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg got the Bulgarian throne . " The Prisoner Of Zenda " is not based on the story of Alexander of Battenberg , but it shows the type of conspiracy atmosphere that pervaded the area . Basically the plot is an old one of substitutions concerning political figures . Dumas had used one in " The Vicomte De Bragalone " , a huge multi-volume novel that included " The Man In The Iron Mask " . One of the theories about the Iron Mask ( the one that Dumas used ) was that it was the twin brother of King Louis XIV . In that novel D'Artagnan has to thwart a plot to replace the Sun King with his brother - a plot that almost succeeds . Hope changed this slightly . Here the King is threatened by his ambitious half-brother , and the King's distant twin cousin replaces him to save the throne . The 1937 film version of the novel is usually considered the best of several ( including the 1951 version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr , and a comic version with Peter Sellers and Lionel Jeffries in 1978 ) . David Selznick was the producer , this being part of his series of movies-based-on-famous-novels that included " A Tale Of Two Cities " ( also with Colman ) , " David Copperfield " ( with W . C . Fields ) , and finally " Gone With The Wind " . His casting was top notch , with Colman supported by Madeleine Carroll , Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , Raymond Massey , Mary Astor , C . Aubrey Smith , and David Niven . It is an exciting and well made film , and definitely worth watching . Selznick hoped to do the sequel " Rupert Of Hentzau " , but that book is a comparative downer . Several of the main characters from the first novel are killed , and one of them shows a less likable side to his personality than in the first story . He toyed with a total rewrite of the story , to try to make Fairbanks a hero instead of a villain . The project never reached fruition . Probably just as well . It is rare for a successful film production to be replicated in a sequel .
492048	3280905	768324	9.0	How to Raise Sale Revenues ?	Business is bad at Grace Brothers , and Mr . Rumbold ( Nicholas Smith ) calls for a meeting of the staff to discuss ways of bringing business into the store . Besides the initial problem of getting the women's and men's wear department people in at some point , the meeting finds a depressing lack of ideas , except for one fairly sensible one : Captain Peacock ( Frank Thornton ) figures that a fashion show would certainly make people aware of the good and practical clothing sold at the store . In typical fashion Rumbold ( who is usually befuddled and timid , except when throwing his own importance around ) appropriates Peacock's idea only changing the title of the fashion show . The episode's last ten minutes show an impatient Young Mr . Grace ( Harold Bennett - he's impatient because he does not want to miss the Walt Disney cartoon at the movies , where he is going after work ) watching a make-ship fashion show by the staff to get an idea of what the concept is . In typical fashion the costumes of the personnel mirror their personalities ( Peacock dressed like a prosperous professional and strutting about ; Mr . Humphreys - John Inman - flouncing around in an elegant but flamboyant outfit ) . In the end , Mr . Grace makes a sensible suggestion ( for a change ) that brings some discomfort to Mr . Rumbold .
492768	3280905	44789	9.0	Oh , What a Tangled Web We Weave . . . .	If you examine any major film or novel or play defects pop up . If the work is worth watching or reading you won't mind them - and if you are considering directing or producing a version of the written work you will find a way to overcome the defect . Most film noir plots do have defects in them . Given how he has romanced his late partner's wife , and how he knows that some of the police ( like Barton MacLaine ) would like to ruin him , in real life Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade would fully cooperate with the San Francisco police regarding Jerome Cowan's murder in THE MALTESE FALCON . Given the homicidal nature of Lawrence Tierney in BORN TO KILL , Walter Slezak would probably not try to blackmail him and Claire Trevor . In fact , he might find an excuse to drop Esther Howard as a client . KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is a taught and exciting film noir at the tail end of the period when such films were being made . Preston Foster is the former head of detectives for the Kansas City Police , who was forced to leave his post because of a change in city political structures that he did not prepare for . He is bitter about this forced retirement , and so he creates a scheme to commit a major armed robbery of a bank , using three low-lifes ( Jack Elam , Lee Van Cleef , and Nevil Brand ) as his bandits . But he arranges for them to wear masks when they all meet ( he is wearing one too ) so that none of them know each other or him . They are given half a playing card as a key of mutual recognition when they are to reunite for the splitting of the money ( some six months after the robbery , in a resort in Mexico ) . Now , in real life the three convicts would ( of course ) be dying to know who their partners and boss were . I can't believe they would not make some effort to find out ( compare this to Humphrey Bogart's clever way of tracing down Edward G . Robinson's phone number in THE AMAZING DR . CLITTERHOUSE , to see what is more likely to occur ) . But as this film is going in a different direction , I am willing to suspend my disbelief and just accept that Elam , Van Cleef , and Brand - despite all being thoroughly dangerous and nasty customers - are willing to go along with this witless demand by Foster . There have been comments made here ( understandably ) that Foster's attitude to John Payne , accidentally framed by the scheme as being the thief , are not consistent . Actually they are . Foster never intended for the three goons he used to split the money and get away with their shares . He was planning to spring a trap on them - as though he had solved the robbery himself - and so reclaim his job with the Kansas City police . Precisely how he would do this we never learn ( presumably he would have somehow killed them before they could identify him by his voice ) . But his plot miscarries when he gets involved with Payne , seeking to clear himself . Suddenly , watching Payne's involvement ( and realizing that Payne has been romancing his daughter ( Colleen Gray ) he is conscience-stricken . You see , framing Payne was never part of the scheme . The scenes with Payne are among the best acting that performer ever made . John Payne , in the 1930s and 1940s , was mostly in comedies or in supporting parts , and in many musicals for 20th Century Fox . It was only in the aftermath of his best recalled role ( the attorney for Edmund Gwenn in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET ) that he began appearing in off-beat noir regular films or noir westerns . It turned out he was a fully capable performer in negative ( or quasi-negative ) roles . Here he has the misfortune to be fingered by his ex-convict past , and his chance appearance as the driver of a similar florist van to the one used in the robbery . He gets the third degree from the police , before they find out his alibi is checking out . But the newspapers have plastered his face and history all over the place , so he loses his job and can't get another . He is only able to hang on and locate his first clue with an assist from an old friend who understands what he is going through . The performance of Foster is good given the odd situation he faces of having set up a scheme to go from a to b to c to d , and finding it is thrown off kilter by something he never intended . I like the performances of Jack Elam , who has a serious drug problem ( in the days that drug addiction was rarely discussed in movies - but notice how many " cigarettes " he's smoking , and how he is shaking ) , and of Lee Van Cleef , as a totally amoral criminal . Elam's death scene ( he is unarmed , but by force of habit lunges for a gun that Payne has on his own person , and is shot by the police ) is surprisingly sympathetic as he is crying and laughing as he dies . Van Cleef , smart enough to figure out that Payne is not who says he is , is as ready to kill Payne as he might be ready to kill his temporary ally Nevil Brand . Actually , Brand's performance ( compared to the others ) is not developed . Maybe part was cut . Colleen Gray is wonderfully controlled and sexy as Foster's daughter and Payne's love interest . For a " B " feature , it gets remarkable strength - comparable to the original THE NARROW MARGIN . I give it a " 9 " out of a possible " 10 " .
493302	3280905	38363	9.0	It was not old Mrs . Plunkett who was summoned	Rex Harrison is Charles Condimine , a prominent novelist whose first wife Elvira ( Kay Hammond ) died of flu-type illness ) . His second wife , Ruth ( Constance Cummings ) is planning to assist his research into the occult for a new novel . This includes a dinner party where a local medium ( Madame Arcati - Margaret Rutherford ) is invited to hold a séance . So far it seems simple . Harrison and Cummings treat the whole matter as a joke ( politely , of course ) , but just before the séance begins Madame Arcati requests some music - and Ruth finds a recording of Irving Berlin's song " Always " and puts it on . Charles shows disquiet at this ( the first time that happens ) , but despite protests the record is put in . And as a result , when Madame Arcati puts the record on she manages to contact Elvira , who shows up ( much to Charles increasing panic ) . " Always " , you see , was her favorite tune . So begins Noel Coward's ( and David Lean's ) film version of BLITHE SPIRIT . It is , technically , the best of the three films based on Coward's classic comedies ( the other two are PRIVATE LIVES and DESIGN FOR LIVING ) . Note , for example , the way Elvira is colored green in the film-stock . But in it's way it is flawed just as they are . Enough remains , however , for an above average comedy . To it's credit it revealed Margaret Rutherford as the delightful , eccentric comic actress who would help push British comedies in the 1950s and 1960s ( until she became the first popular Mrs . Marple , and an Oscar winner for THE V . I . P . S ) . Look at her trances , as her voice assumes that of the little girl ( with a runny nose ) who is her contact with the other side . Rex Harrison gave one of his best comic performances as a realistic man caught in a occult nightmare ( when Arcati says the spirit she contacts wants to speak to Charles , it is suggested that it is the recently deceased " old Mrs . Plunkett " who wants to speak to him - a surprised and annoyed Harrison asks , " Why should old Mrs . Plunkett want to speak to me ? " It's a typical response . ) As the two warring wives , Hammond and Cummings are quite good , the former all frivolous and fun loving , the latter more down-to-earth and serious . But both love Charles , although not blind to his real flaws . Nor , as it turns out , is he blind to theirs . The film is better than Lubitsch's DESIGN FOR LIVING . That one had some nice touches in it ( I mentioned Edward Everett Horton's " Honeymoon " kick in my review of that film ) , but it was censored in revealing the bi-sexuality of the characters played by Cooper and March . Here the flaw is that the end is tampered with for a final joke , but while cute ( and ironic ) it hurts the way Coward ended his play . I saw Richard Chamberlain and Geraldine Page ( in her last role as Madame Arcati ) in a stage production in the late 1980s . The play ends with Charles free to leave and continue with his life ( indeed , Madame Arcati urges him to go ) . But he first tells off his two wives , and leaves them trapped together . Coward favored that particular ending - it was more in line with his theme in the play that even the happiest marriages flounder in part because of personality clashes , and attempts by wives to control husbands that just lie under the surface . It is not dismissed in the film - on the contrary the theme is broadly shown - but the film suggests that it is impossible to escape this . It is not going to ruin watching the film , but it does weaken Coward's vision of things .
493035	3280905	734607	10.0	From the age of Grover Cleveland to the Age of Eisenhower	This is a clever episode of TWILIGHT ZONE that was comic rather than strange or tragic . Buster Keaton is Woodrow Mulligan , a janitor from 1890 America , works in a laboratory . He is constantly griping about the life problems around him : meat is too expensive ( it's like $1 . 00 / lb . Unheard of ! ) . He is always yelling after crazy speeders ( on bicycles - autos haven't appeared yet ) . Griping to the end , he sees a helmet like device by a scientist , and puts it on and tries it . Suddenly he is in modern America . The beginning was a seven minute silent film . Now it is all noise , all talking , all beeping , all blowing . Keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better . He runs into Stanley Adams , a Professor Rollo , who realizes that Mulligan is from c . 1890 ( he mentions President Cleveland ) . Rollo has always wanted to live in that charming , quiet age . He helps Mulligan get the helmet repaired , and they go back in time . Rollo gets bored after awhile , due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use . Mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future . But now Woodrow is fully content with the quiet , simple age he lives in . He has found contentment . In his last fifteen years Buster Keaton was frequently on television ( many times for Allan Funt on CANDID CAMERA , where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public ) . He did make a few films as well ( most notably A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM and THE RAILRODDER ) . But he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes . He is in his element here , presumably advising the director ( old comedy film director Norman McLeod - he directed the Marx Brothers in HORSE FEATHERS ) on the tricks he could do . Watch how Stanley Adams and he time Adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs . In terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like SHERLOCK JR . The episode does show Keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties . The appearances of Jesse White ( here as a repairman , of all things ) is always welcome . But look a bit at " Professor Rollo " . Stanley Adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977 . Plump , with unkempt appearance , and heavy , booming voice , his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT ( he wants Anthony Quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an Indian ) . His best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the Starship Enterprise in STAR TREK to those furry , fertile little creatures " Tribbles " ( as in " The Trouble With " ) . Adams was always worth watching ( like Jesse White , and certainly like Keaton ) , enhancing most of the productions he appeared in . I have never understood his suicide , but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer .
493170	3280905	32554	10.0	The Truth About the American Democratic System	The 1940s saw the appearance of four major American directors : Orson Welles , John Huston , Billy Wilder , and Preston Sturgis . They had careers of varying degrees of success . Welles is usually seen as the great talent done to death by the jackals of the Hollywood system and his own personality quirks . Wilder and Huston were both more successful , although both met with serious problems as well - Huston with the threat of the blacklist in the last 1940s , and Wilder with increasing feelings of irrelevance in the industry after 1969 . Sturgis actually had a far longer career in Hollywood , as he was a highly successful screenplay writer in the 1930s . But his heyday as a great comedy director lasted only from 1940 - 1948 , and even then with two projects ( THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK and UNFAITHFULLY YOURS ) failures at the box office . His last two films ( THE BEAUTIFUL BLOND OF BASHFUL BEND and THE FRENCH THEY ARE A FUNNY FACE were not as good as the films that preceded them . He was finished as a filmmaker by 1955 . Even Welles lasted longer . His first film comedy ( that he wrote and directed ) is THE GREAT MCGINTY ( 1940 ) starring Brian Donleavy as the title character . It remains the best study of the weaknesses of the democracy our country prides itself on every 4th of July or other patriotic occasion . For the whole joke of the rise and fall of Dan McGinty is that he only succeeds when he fully works alongside the corrupt Boss ( Akim Tamiroff ) and the latter's underlings ( William Demerest , Harry Rosenthal ) , and when he actually tries to personally reform and be the good statesman , he is brought down by the Boss in disgrace . Said this way the joke sounds flat , but Sturgis ' witty and perceptive script is not flat at all . Basically the problem comes down to this - how seriously do Americans take their system ? As I said before we give a lip service to it , and we follow the forms , but do we really understand the nature of the public trust imposed on our elected officials ( and the electorate ) ? It is doubtful . The reason is that everyone is more concerned with earning a living for themselves and their families . At one point Muriel Angelus tells William Demerest she has just read a book in which the writer points out that the money spread around by political corruption actually does help everyone by stimulating business and prosperity . Demerest shoots back that he wishes that book was read by everyone in the country . Of course Demerest's self interest would push this theory . But is he far from totally wrong ? When Donleavy runs for Governor he is Mayor of the state's largest city . There is a series of inter-cut scenes of Demerest giving a speech for Donleavy while Robert Warwick gives a speech for the " reform " candidate . Warwick keeps harping on the useless public roads and public works that Donleavy and his cronies have foisted on the public to line their pockets . But Demerest reminds the public that as a result of these acts of public construction hundreds of families were fed during what was the depression , and the result gave the people " the most beautiful city in the world . " For all of Warwick's high toned attack , the actually results of the corruption seem rather sensible . Akim Tamiroff's boss seems like a typical political hood , but if you listen carefully his comments culminating in " America is land of great opportunity " merely mirrors comments like those of the Tammany Hall sage George Washington Plunkitt in the early 20th Century , who said he " saw his opportunities and took ' em . " Plunkitt differentiated between " honest graft " ( i . e . inflating the prices of public works projects which do benefit the city ) , and " dishonest graft " ( stealing the iron roof of an almshouse to sell it to a scrap iron dealer ) . But there are examples of dishonest graft in Tamiroff's world - examples that Plunkitt would have known of . When Donleavy starts his way up the political power tree , he is an " enforcer " collecting bribes from bordello operators and bar owners . This is not as gray an area of corruption as the public works issue - how do you defend shake-downs of small fry ? Sturgis , in the end , destroys the machine and the would-be reformer by showing the impossibility of reform . Donleavy tries to make a stand , but his principled attempt is ignored as the public learns he took bribes . He is swept out of power as rapidly ( in it's way ) as his rise from bum to governor had been . Yet even Sturgis must have realized that in the real world such sudden altruism would not have occurred to rock the boat . In his later film , THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK , we find both Donleavy and Tamiroff back in power together , running the state - and ( in the end of that film ) solving the problems of the hero and heroine .
491961	3280905	43915	10.0	" Not if you stand on tippy toe on the tallest mountain in the world . "	In talking about Joseph Mankiewicz one has to notice the highly excellent dialog he writes . He is one of the most literate of all major directors , best shown in LETTER TO THREE WIVES and ALL ABOUT EVE . The same can be said for this unusual Cary Grant film , made in 1951 at the height of the McCarthy Era , One has to keep the McCarthy period in mind when discussing this film . Mankiewicz was targeted by the Hollywood right wing when President of the Screen Directors Guild . His chief foe was Cecil B . DeMille , who thought Mankiewicz ( with his liberal point of view ) was a left winger . He was also targeted ( along with William Wyler and Billy Wilder ) for their foreign sounding ( i . e . Jewish ) names or pronunciations ( DeMille had Jewish ancestry too , but he liked to overlook it ! ) . In a confrontation to throw Mankiewicz out of his Presidency of the Guild , DeMille confronted the one director in Hollywood he could not scare : John Ford . Ford basically said that while he admired DeMille's productions and work , he thought he was a total creep . That ended DeMille's move against Mankiewicz . Having been a near victim of petty and bigoted persecution , Mankiewicz decided to do this film based on an old German movie . Grant plays a very talented doctor and teacher , Dr . Praetorius , who is one of the most popular figures in a university and it's town . Only one person ( Hume Cronyn ) is opposed to Grant . Cronyn ( as was pointed out in another review on this site ) does not hesitate to spread rumors and scandal against people he dislikes to improve his own scholastic position . Here he starts looking into Grant's background . A wiz at psychiatry , Grant would be a holistic physician today , figuring that his patient's mental condition has to be taken into consideration in treatment . He finds a new patient in Jeanne Crain , who comes to him regarding a physical problem she wants him to take care of : she's pregnant . She hopes he will give her an abortion ( although this is not openly stated - in 1951 the Hollywood code was still in effect ) . As she falls asleep during the interview , Grant pretends to examine her and tells her it was a false alarm . He starts visiting her , and finally discovers he likes her . Eventually he proposes marriage , and rescues her and her father ( Sidney Blackmer ) from the less than generous minded " charity " of Blackmer's brother Will Wright ( a nice , mean character performance ) . Grant and Crain marry , and then she discovers she is pregnant . Although this strains the relationship , Crain realizes after awhile that Grant has not only saved her child , but her reputation . Of course this does not mean his reputation is safe . Cronyn's Professor Elwell is still nosing about for anything to smear Grant with . At one point he invades the home of Grant , and there is a nice confrontation scene with Crain . Eventually he finds something . Grant is always accompanied by a friend and factotum Mr . Shunderson ( Finley Currie ) . Cronyn wonders who he is , and eventually finds that Shunderson ( a quiet , gentle man ) has a secret which looks potentially nasty involving the Canadian police . Triumphantly Cronyn decides to use this information to ruin Grant's standing with the Dean of the University ( Basil Ruysdael - who like most of the staff barely tolerates Cronyn ) , and the Board of Trustees . Grant is working on a concert ( he is conducting the " Academic Overture " of Johnannes Brahms ) . He has to give up this work , and stop worrying - if he can - for the health of Crain and " their " child ( now in the concluding phase of her pregnancy ) to face the accusation . I won't go into the amusing story behind Currie's run-in with the police . All I'll say is that Currie has one of his two best roles in this film ( the other was as Magwich in David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS ) and the high point is when he quietly , and effectively tells off Cronyn about his personality failure . The quote in the " Summary Line " above is from the conclusion of that scene . Other shine in the film besides Currie and Cronyn and Wright and Ruysdael . Walter Slezak plays an " Einstein " clone part , who is one of Grant's closest friends on campus - a nice " nice person " change of pace for him . Also look at the scene of the comic argument between Grant , Slezak , and Blackmer regarding electric trains that crash . Grant plays one of his oddest roles , but handles it well ( as does Crain as the woman he saves and then falls in love with ) . Also Margaret Hamilton as a gossip who won't admit she's a gossip . If not as well known as LETTER or EVE , PEOPLE WILL TALK is as fascinating as those two film classics .
493086	3280905	45810	10.0	" But Square-cut or Pear-shaped , These Rocks Don't Lose Their Shape ! "	As pointed out the film GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is really the first great movie role in the career of Marilyn Monroe . Given the brevity of her film career ( roughly a decade ) , one third of it passed without her being more than . . . well , let's face it " male eye candy " . Her sexiness and apparently " dumb blond " personality fit her just as a film decoration - an entertainment for drooling men to watch . This was hardly fair ( as Marilyn did eventually prove ; and as fellow movie bombshells like Jayne Mansfield rarely did ) . Marilyn had popped up in some films of interest : the last Marx Brother Movie ( as a Marx Brother Movie ) , LOVE HAPPY - but only for one wasted moment ; MONKEY BUSINESS ( as an imagined rival to Ginger Rogers - but again wasted , as she was playing opposite Cary Grant ) ; THE ASPHALT JUNGLE ( where she was Louis Calhern's mistress ) ; CLASH BY NIGHT ( where she essayed a serious part , but was again in support to Barbara Stanwyck ) . I suspect it was that her physical attributes dictated the sex appeal over anything else . But it wasted one third of her film career ! Marilyn was not seen to have a brain . Other blonds did show intelligence ( Doris Day and Kim Novak and Grace Kelly come to mind , and all three were getting meatier roles in this period ) . But Marilyn could only hope for some break to take her out of the background . Anita Loos had written her novella in the 1920s , and it was a smash hit then and ever since . One really ought to read the book to understand a small difference between Loos ' view of Lorelei Lee of Little Rock , Arkansas , and both the musical version of Carol Channing and the film version of Marilyn to see the improvement in the latter two . Loos was spoofing the dumb blond . Lorelei is dumb - she has no sense of the real world . She is telling her own story in the novella ( by the way , Carol Channing actually did a recording of the book that is worth listening to ) . Lorelei is the sort of idiot who insists she was an actress in film because she was in the Babylonian palace staircase shot ( with 10 , 000 other people ) in Griffiths ' INTOLERANCE . She is a good time girl - a modern flapper sans intelligence . Money and success fall into her lap ( quite literally ) due to her affect on men . She's aware of it , but she lacks the sense that the stage and screen versions add . Channing and Monroe both show they understand that CURRENTLY they are appealing to men , but that with aging they can't depend on this attraction to pay the bills . Monroe ( in the film ) may try to imagine what a tiara would look like on her in a childish way at a ship's dinner table , but she knows the security of owning such jewelry brings . The final moment that her cleverness is revealed is when she confronts Taylor Holmes ( the father of her fiancé Tommy Noonan ) in Paris . She openly says she is interested in Holmes ' money , and that men are hypocrites because they want their daughters to marry only rich men , and don't want their sons to wind up with " gold diggers " . Holmes has to admit that she is smarter than he was told , and she says she can be smart when she wants to be . The appealing thing of the film is the camaraderie between Monroe and Jane Russell . People hearing of the teaming thought the set would become a real war-zone between blonde and brunette bombshells . Instead the two actresses became lifelong friends , and their friendship translates well between that of Lorelie and Dorothy Shaw . They both are aware of their effect on men , and their need for a supporting sister figure . And they work fine as a team . Note how they handle Elliot Reid when they want to get the incriminating photos he's taken of Marilyn and Charles Coburn ( " Beakie " ) . The men do well in their parts , especially Noonan as the fretful Gus and Reid as the smart ( usually ) detective Ernie ( he does eventually prove himself to the satisfaction of Russell ) . George Winslow's " Henry Spofford III " has a wonderful moment warning Monroe about that old goat's ( Coburn's ) intentions . Coburn is fine , usually henpecked by his overbearing wife Norma Varden . As for the loss of the Julie Styne tunes , the musical is firmly set in the 1920s and many references ( to prohibition , and historically forgotten folks like actor Fiske O'Hara ) are quite dim . Modernizing the tale was not a bad idea . And the two Carmichael tunes - especially Russell's number with the Olympic team - are good . It was an excellent first major part for Monroe to step into .
492255	3280905	275375	10.0	Again a gem I caught on You Tube	The Second World War may be over sixty years old , but it still is quite alive as one of the most photographed and recorded conflicts of all time . The pictures caught by newsreels of the Blitz in London are among the most powerful images of that conflict - and may have done more to solidify American public opinion against the Axis than anything else before Pearl Harbor . But to the British it was not something to horrify an audience that would then turn around and go home to safe beds blessing the two large oceans that seemed to protect them . English , Welsh , Scots , and Irish were within bombing distance of German planes , and subject to months , even years , of attack . So this was a life-and-death matter . GO TO BLAZES is a brief comic short starring Will Hays , a name not too well known ( unfortunately ) in the U . S . But from 1933 or so up to the war he made a series of comedies with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott that critics have compared to the Marx Brothers - films like ASK A POLICEMAN or OH MR . PORTER ! . Hays is similar to Groucho in that he is always in a minor leadership post ( schoolmaster or cop ) which he bungles or uses for his own advantage , hampered by his even dumber two associates ( Moffatt is the fat young man , and Marriott is the elderly nincompoop ) . Somehow they ( like Groucho , Harpo , Chico , and Zeppo ) bungle their way to triumph in the end . In GO TO BLAZES , Hays is married to Muriel George , and they live with their grown up daughter Thora Hird . Hays is not too happy that George is not there to give him a hot dinner , but he's told it is in the stove . While his daughter is studying math , he tells her he has been asked to give a lecture on putting out fires from Nazi incendiary bombs . He is certain he's up to it , as he has read the pamphlet on the subject . We see him practicing before a mirror , and as he gives his speech we see the reality behind his expertise . He is dumb enough to try to carry his fire fighting equipment while still holding onto a pan of bacon he was cooking for his dinner . He keeps lucking out actually - he's so incompetent he can't stop one bomb going from the roof to the basement , accidentally landing into a bucket of water ( he claims he strategically placed it there . Ms George returns and she too is surprised that he is going to give this talk . Then they realize an incendiary has hit the house again , but while Hay acts with typical bumbling Ms George and Ms Hird act promptly and manage to control the fire quickly . At the end Ms George insists Hay take lessons on incendiary controls that the government is giving . He hesitates , until he learns where the classes are near . Less than ten minutes long it is an amusing comedy . Until now it is the only complete film of Hays I have been fortunate to see ( on You Tube , as I said above ) . I strongly recommend it as a way to see what this fine comedian was like . Also as a reminder of what the British public had to put up with from 1940 - 1945 in wartime .
493158	3280905	734563	10.0	The Need To Remember . . . For All Of Us	I can't make up my mind about the best TWILIGHT ZONE episodes , but this one is up there . It was one of the few where Serling ( whose stories broke down the fourth wall of imagination and reality for his characters ) broke down a fifth wall ( if you will ) by explaining the need to remember , even if the item used to remember was something hideous . In this case it was the death camps that exist throughout middle Europe since World War II , and are now museums dedicated to their millions of victims . Oscar Beregi made a career as a general type of character actor , frequently in comic parts , but equally in villains . And as a villain he was never more superb than in this episode as an unrepentant Nazi S . S . man . Assigned to Dachau during World War II , he lorded over the inmates , killing them at his various whims . Somehow he has managed to avoid a date with an execution shed , and now ( sixteen years after the war ended ) he has returned to see the place where he was a king . It's obvious that he is full of contempt to everyone who is in his way . He forces a landlady of an inn ( Kaaren Verne ) to reveal the hateful name of the camp nearby ( enjoying her discomfort ) . At the camp ( oddly enough pretty empty - usually there are tourists at these camps examining the crematorium and gas chambers and such ) he is strutting about as though still in his Nazi military uniform and jack boots . Then he comes across a familiar person : one Becker ( Joseph Schildkraut ) , a former Jewish prisoner . But Becker is still in his prison clothes . Delight at finding Becker - a victim still in his victim uniform - slowly changes to dismay and fear . Beregi is soon imprisoned and facing a trial for his life from a jury of the spirits of his victims ( led by the long dead Becker ) . They present the history of his cruelty , and he meets it with arrogance and pride but it gradually crumbles . Soon he is mumbling the same arguments used at Nuremburg by the Nazis , and with no better effect . At the end he is struck down as guilty . He is found in great pain and incoherent - obviously insane but feeling more pain than anyone can stand . At the end the doctor ( Ben Wright ) who sees Beregi is taken to an asylum looks at the camp . He wonders when they will tear down this awful place . As he leaves we hear Serling speaking to us - that we can never tear down places like Dachau and Auschwitz , because of the lesson they teach that once a bunch of people tried to turn the world into a graveyard . . . and nearly succeeded . It is a powerful commentary on a fascinating situation .
492052	3280905	212346	10.0	What is the Value of the Modern Beauty Contest ?	A very funny film , with a first rate cast , MISS CONGENIALITY deals with examining the value of an American institution . When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the " Miss America " pageant ( as well as the other beauty pageant for " Miss Universe " ) . Watching Bert Parks ' singing the " Miss America " song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl . In fact , when Parks was fired from " Miss America " in the 1980s , the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert . But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s . There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years . Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions ( Question : " What do you wish for ? " ; Usual answer : " World peace ! " ) . Others , especially feminists , were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning " meat markets " displaying women for sex purposes only - and not really emphasizing women's brains . The pageants are still around , but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s . Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more ( the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams , who lost the title for an infraction of the rules , and subsequently had a successful - and still flourishing - acting career : something that rarely happens to the regular winners ) . Here , there has been a bombing ( and killing ) at the " Miss United States " beauty pageant . As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this . The team happens to find evidence that suggests a " Unibomber " type did , but they don't know for certain . One of the recent recruits , Sandra Bullock , is to enter the contest as " Miss New Jersey " . This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman ( and former " Miss United States " ) Candace Bergen . Bergen is not happy about the choice : Bullock is all professional FBI agent , with little in the way of a sense of fun , and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of make-up . The FBI team , headed by Benjamin Bratt , assigns a former member of the " Miss United States " pageant ( Michael Caine ) to " prettify " and prepare Bullock for her assignment . It almost leads to mutual murder . Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences . Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this . Bullock finds Caine insulting ( he admits to a stylish elitism ) , and she finds the new regimen impossible . Not only must she learn some talent ( they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses , like Ben Franklin's armonica ) , but she has to walk with poise , be graceful , and keep her weight under control ( some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables ) . She is also trying to see the value of the contest . Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism , and works hard at being a good agent . She sees the contest as a sexist , out-of-date affair . She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants , most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest . She is particularly protective about " Miss Rhode Island " ( Heather Burns ) , who seems to have self-confidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest . Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a non-professional manner : she and Bratt are both attracted to each other , but she can't find any time to make time for him ( nor he for her ) . If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest , or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine . This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair . Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen - a long time supporter of the contest , she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions ( and thus raising the image of women ) . And she resents the all-to-easy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest . The film also has it's version of Parks , in it's traditional host played by William Shatner . Certainly not the same as his " Captain Kirk " or even ( currently ) " Denny Crane " , Shatner's " Stan Fields " has a popular following among the older generation , who like his pleasant inane jokes ( you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke ) , and his singing the theme song . His performance is like additional icing on the cake . And a well made cake it is .
492008	3280905	65292	10.0	The Victor of Blenheim and his Spouse	The name most people think of as best associated with the term PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND is Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill . After all , he was the Prime Minister who was ( with FDR and Stalin ) the Big Three who won World War II , and he was also a man who was in the public eye as a political figure of the first rank from 1905 to 1955 . Churchill was a great lover of tradition , and he would write several books of biography and history which eventually won him the Nobel Prize for Literature . His reputation as a historian is for his Memoirs of the First and Second World Wars and his biography of his ancestors John and Sarah Churchill , First Duke and Duchess of Marleborough . It is this biography , MARLEBOROUGH : HIS LIFE AND TIMES , that is the basis for this series . The positive virtues are that it is well acted and produced , and well written . John Neville gave a sterling performance as the military genius who stopped Louis XIV's armies , and Susan Hampshire and Margaret Tyzack ( reunited from THE FORTSYTE SAGA ) were first rate as Sarah , the wife of Marleborough , who became the closest friend and adviser to Princess ( later Queen ) Anne of England , and as that monarch . The story describes how the three reach the apogee of power together , until Marleborough's enemies bring him down , even replacing Sarah with her cousin Abigail Masham ( Jill Balcom ) as the Queen's closest confidant . Assisting them in their rise was Marleborough's closest friend Sidney Godolphin ( John Standing ) , who would be the Chancellor of Exchequer . The story would also detail the history of British politics from 1678 to 1714 , through the reigns of Charles II ( James Villiers ) , James II ( James Westbrook ) , William III and Mary II ( Alan Rowe and Lisa Danieli ) , and Anne ( Tyzack ) . This would include events that the Churchills , Godolphin , Anne , and others had to evade , like the Popish Plot , the revolt of the Duke of Monmouth ( James Kerry ) , the 1696 Assassination scheme of Sir John Fenwick ( which implicated Marleborough ) , and the wars of Europe caused by Louis XIV that led to the War of the Spanish Succession ( 1702 - 1714 ) which left England ( barely ) the most powerful state in Europe . Marleborough's strategic and diplomatic brilliance gave England the margin to beat France - but Louis was able to take advantage of serious political schisms in Britain between Marleborough and his followers , Robert Harley ( Richard Pearson ) , Harley's ally and later rival Henry St . John ( Michael Attwell ) , and the Duke of Shrewsberry to pull some of France's chestnuts out of the fire . This was a weighty piece of history , and the performances were quite delightful ( James Villiers gave Charles II just the right lightness of touch to make one realize how formidable a political opponent he really was ) . But the problem is that John and Sarah are shown to be always right and always looking out for Britain's best interests . In fact , the Tories were quite critical of John Churchill as an opportunist who knew when to switch sides in time ( like his predecessor , General George Monk in 1660 , or the future French statesman , Charles Talleyrand ) . He was also exceptionally gifted at feathering his nest ( Sarah got him a lot of money through her contacts with Anne , and he was willing to take " gifts " from various European allies ) . Sir Winston evades this - feeling it is so much " propaganda " by Marleborough's enemies . If so , the propaganda has not been totally dismissed by historians since the 1930s ( when the biography was written ) . Nor was it dismissed by Whig historians prior to Churchill writing his biography . Thomas Macauley's A HISTORY OF ENGLAND is quite open about John Churchill's greed - but he died before he really discussed Churcill's military victories at Ramilies , Blenheim . Maplaquet , Oudenarde , etc . By all means , if you see the series enjoy it . But do some personal reading on your own to see the other side of the coin regarding John and Sarah .
492273	3280905	54698	10.0	Two drifters off to see the world	It's a little odd watching BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and realizing that of it's main stars only Patricia Neal , Mickey Rooney , and Jose Luis de Villalonga ( who played the wealthy Brazilian in the movie ) are still alive , as is the director Blake Edwards . Audrey Hepburn , George Peppard , Buddy Ebsen , Martin Balsam , John McGiver , Alan Reed Jr . , Stanley Adams , and Dorothy Whitney are all gone , as is Truman Capote and George Axelrod and the cats who played " Cat " . The city of New York is still a fascinating one , but much of it has changed . For instance , the card catalogs of the 42nd Street Public Library that Holly Golightly and Paul Varjak visit are not in those card drawers as they showed in the film scene . They were photocopied into multi-volume sets of card catalog volumes in the early 1970s , and since then the remainder have been put on computers . Even in the late 1960s and early 1970s the reading room did not have any sculptures in them - just desks and library shelves and the central area to pick up the books you ordered . The period of the film is quite set in New York City in 1959 - 61 . Take a look at the " Halloween masks " on sale in the Woolworth's that Holly and Paul steal . Among the masks they try on is one of Huckleberry Hound , the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character who was popular in 1960 . It is mentioned on this thread that the mask reminds us of the lyrics in " MOON RIVER " regarding " my huckleberry friend " . But that reference was to " Huckleberry Finn " , and his being found on the Mississippi River ( possibly the original for the " Moon River " of the song ) . It had nothing to do with the cartoon character . ( Come to think of it , Woolworth's itself is a thing of the past - it having gone out of business five years ago . ) But the story is still quite compelling , and Holly remains Audrey Hepburn's best remembered performance ( even more than her Royal Princess in ROMAN HOLIDAY ) . Only her performance as Eliza Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY is as recalled by name , and Holly is more glamorous from the start . Holly is not really " Holly " but Lula Mae Barnes Golightly - one time second wife of Doc Golightly ( Ebsen ) , who tired of country living and got an annulment , and has only tried to get some financial footing to help herself and her brother Fred ( who is currently in the army ) . She has always found life hard ( Doc tells Paul that Lula and Fred were caught by him stealing turkey eggs when kids ) . So Holly discovers that only if she can be a sophisticate can she break her poverty routes . She is " discovered " by Hollywood movie boss O . J . Berman ( Balsam ) who classifies her as " a real phony " , meaning that she really buys the glitz and color he has taught her . But Holly is a call girl , and she has not found the man who can rescue her ( and brother Fred ) from poverty . She does find a fellow drifter - Paul Varjak , a writer and kept man for wealthy ( Mrs . Failenson ) . He is living in the apartment above Holly's , and the two do become close ( in the original story they only become confidants - Paul in the novel is gay ) . Slowly , in the film Paul finds that Holly is such a fragile type that he falls in love with her - unlike himself she needs protection . But she is determined to hook her millionaire - so she goes after " Rusty Trawler " the ninth richest man in the world , and " Jose Da Silva Pereira " - the wealthy Brazilian ) . In the meantime , to pay the rent between her " dates " Holly agrees to deliver " weather reports " from Sing Sing prison , where she visits mobster Sally Tomato ( Alan Reed in a really nice little cameo ) . She is unaware of the meaning of those messages . Holly is something of a classy feather-head , not being able to understand the reports of " snow " in New Orleans from Uncle Sally , nor being able to understand how she gets under the skin of her neighbor , the photographer Mr . Yunioshi ( Mickey Rooney ) . She drives the latter crazy by her constantly waking him up to let her into the apartment when she forgets her passkey , and also by her loud parties . Yet even Yunioshi is secretly captivated by this annoying neighbor : notice how she gets him to calm down by promising to allow him he'll photograph her in the buff . All the performances are fine ( of note see Ebsen in his saddest part , as the broken-hearted Doc , but notice too John McGiver's fine salesman at Tiffany's ) . Rooney's Yunioshi is now considered racist , but it was not seen as such in 1961 - in fact it was normal ( compare to Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON ) . On the whole the film still is well worth watching .
491834	3280905	151568	10.0	Their Masterpiece Operetta	In 1884 William Schwenk Gilbert came up with the idea for a new operetta which he took to his partners Richard D'Oyly Carte and Sir Arthur Sullivan . It was about a lozenge or a drink which if taken could change the party digesting it into any person he or she wanted . Gilbert had ideas about how to develop this idea into a full story , but as he outlined the idea he was told by his partners it would not do . His only alternative was his first " medieval " Savoy Opera . In 1882 Lord Tennyson had created a verse play called THE PRINCESS . It , like all Tennyson's plays , was politely successful because of their creator's popularity . Like his fellow poet , Robert Browning , Tennyson was a good poet but a third - rate dramatist . THE PRINCESS dealt with a princess running a school only for women . Gilbert , no feminist , saw some possibilities for a spoof . So he created PRINCESS IDA , taking Tennyson's basic work and twisting it into a satire on education , feminism , and medieval romances . There would even be a dig at Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory in the song " The Lady and the Ape " . In retrospect it looks odd that Sullivan and Carte accepted it - it was a two act operetta with a prelude ( today it is known as the only three act Savoy Opera ) . Reading it , even with allowance for predominant views of women in 1884 , it is hard to understand why they felt it was suitable or would be popular . My guess is that the medieval background appealed to Sullivan's desire for a grand opera work . PRINCESS IDA ran about eight months . Given that from 1877 to 1884 the average Savoy work ran a year and then some , this was a flop ( it remains something of a flop even now - revivals of PRINCESS IDA are less likely than any of the completed operettas except for THE SORCEROR , UTOPIA LTD . , and THE GRAND DUKE ) . Sullivan actually was better in doing his share in this work than Gilbert was than in any other of their works but THE GRAND DUKE - Gilbert's heart really wasn't in PRINCESS IDA . As a result of this , and Sullivan's knighthood that year , Gilbert was in a weak position . His first offer was to let Sullivan do an operetta with another writer ( Bret Harte was mentioned , interestingly enough ) . Then he offered the lozenge plot . Sullivan refused it again . He wanted a plot with real people and real situations . Actually that Sullivan said this at all shows how little he ever understood of his partner . Gilbert was not a realist , but went to town spoofing logic . At the behest of his wife , Gilbert went to Knightsbridge , where a model Japanese village was exhibited . He found it fascinating , even buying a Japanese ceremonial sword as a souvenir . It was hanging on a wall in his study , where Gilbert was racking his brains for a new idea , when it fell . Gilbert walked to it , picked it up , and began thinking . And theatrical history was made as a result . TOPSY-TURVEY follows the story of how Gilbert presented Sullivan and Carte with their greatest work , THE MIKADO , or THE TOWN OF TITIPOO ( to give it it's complete title ) . It gives more details of the lifestyles and problems of both men ( Gilbert's poisonous relationship with his mother ; his failure to have children with his wife ; Sullivan's relationship with Mrs . Ronalds - his American born lover ) . It looks more deeply into the lives and problems of Jessie Bond , George Grossmith , Rutland Barrignton , Richard Temple , and the other members of the cast and orchestra . As such it is more detailed than THE GREAT GILBERT AND SULLIVAN was , but it only concentrates on the year 1884 to 85 . While all the performances are on target , and touching in their ways , Jim Broadbent as the stern but reliable dramatist gave his first film performance of international stature . He captures the lack of nonsense in the everyday Gilbert , the thorough craftsman of plays and productions standards ( watch him when he rehearses Grossmith and the others - he fully knows the effects he wants ) . He missed out the Oscar that he was nominated for in 1999 , but would get one a few years after for IRIS . His reputation is firmly established now . Oh , about the lozenge plot . Over the years after 1885 Gilbert brought it up again and again in 1887 , 1888 , 1889 . Each time he was shouted down . When the partners went their separate ways briefly after THE GONDELIERS , in 1890 , Gilbert approached Alfred Cellier with the idea . Cellier said yes . Sullivan finally produced his opera , IVANHOE at this time . It ran for four months , and then fell into oblivion . Gilbert and Cellier's THE MOUNTEBANKS ran for about as long as PRINCESS IDA did , and since it was not a Gilbert and Sullivan work that was terrific . It can be revived on occasion . Gilbert had been right about the lozenge plot after all .
492386	3280905	39628	10.0	One of the First ( and Best ) Christmas Holiday Movie Classics	This work has been a comedy joy for over sixty years now , and has even been redone on television a few times - but the original is still the best . It takes a totally fantastic situation ( the possible existence of Santa Claus ) and looks at it from the real world's point of view . It has been said that the eventual recognition of Kris Kringle ( Edmund Gwenn , in his Oscar winning role ) as Santa is due to the necessity of people and organizations in society that can't decry the Christmas spirit . It's too unpopular to do that . Mr Macy ( the fictional owner of the Department store ) is not going to denounce Santa , who helps bring holiday shoppers into his store at Christmas ( neither - although he is not involved in the court case - would his fictional rival Mr . Gimbel ) . The wisdom of the entire matter is summed up in a great speech by Charlie Halloran ( William Frawley ) , the political wizard behind Judge Harper ( Gene Lockhard ) . If Harper decides to deny the existence of Santa he'll make enemies of merchants , toy manufacturers , kids and their parents , and others who get some satisfaction from the material side of the holiday season - Harper will ensure his total defeat at the polls ! It is a lesson the astute Judge takes to heart . I suppose that the materialism of Christmas is to be denounced by purists , who think of the spiritual aspects frequently forgotten at Christmas . But the film reaffirms that the materialism of the holiday actually is an engine to the meaning of the holiday . In celebrating the birth and life of Jesus Christ , one is affirming a belief ( ultimately ) in the goodness of mankind and the truth of love . To show love frequently means sacrifice - here in expensive gifts to loved ones . If the pressures of modern advertising make this materialism too visible , the underlying purpose of gift buying is not to be materialistic but to show one cares for those one loves . Oddly enough Kris himself is willing to advertise the materialism to a point . At the Thanksgiving Day Parade he is last seen telling the children in the crowd that there are plenty of toys to be bought at Macy's ( which , by the way , would be what he or the original " Santa " ( Percy Helton ) would have had to say in any case ) . Only later is Kris able to show more selective honesty here - he does tell one customer ( Thelma Ritter ) where she can get a toy at a cheaper cost than at Macy's . As a result the Department Store picks up on this and starts a policy of guiding people to other stores . In the real world I must admit it would not occur , but one likes the concept and wishes it would . The characters ( for the most part ) are likable , the one exception being Sawyer ( Porter Hall ) the obnoxious store " psychologist " . Sawyer misuses his so-called knowledge to make people feel mentally ill ( telling one nice guy that his yearly stint at an orphanage as Santa is really from some bad act of his from many years past ) . Kris tells off Sawyer very easily , separating this vicious quack from genuine therapists who can help people . ( Kris tells his friend Fred Gailey that he can easily control his visits with therapists , because he knows the answers to their questions which are usually the same ones . Actually this happens to be a common problem in therapy when dealing with criminals in prison who know what the therapists want to hear . But Kris actually does know what good they do , and how Sawyer is misusing his power . By the way , Kris / Gwenn makes a mistake in showing how he knows the right answers . He says John Quincy Adams ' Vice President was Daniel D . Tompkins . Tompkins ( who was Governor of New York in the War of 1812 ) was James Monroe's Vice President - Adams ' Veep was John C . Calhoun . ) The real spiritual sense of the holiday is shown in the relationship of Kris and Fred with Doris and Susan Walker ( Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood ) . Fred begins the process by softening the divorced Doris with his own version of kindness to her and Susan . But it is hard to reach Susan at first ( though she likes Fred ) because Doris is so determined to make her daughter a realist . It is only when Fred realizes that Doris does not like fancy or the outlandish because of her own hard fall into reality through her marriage that he shakes her up regarding what exactly makes life worthwhile ( and it is not an adherence to reality all the time ) . As for Susan , her view is softened by Kris , who becomes a surrogate grandfather to her . The snagging point is that her world would be complete if she had a home , not a cramped apartment with her mother . Kris is concerned about the possibility of granting Susan that wish , but does not give up on it . And ( as it turns out ) it does complete the relationship between Doris and Fred - who will probably marry and move into such a house . We never see this , but we see ( in the last shot ) a symbolic approval of such a plan from Kris to the young couple . Again an affirmation of love , the center of the Christmas holiday .
493113	3280905	39631	10.0	I Think Than Henri Desire Landru Would Have Approved	There is a constant effort by the fans of Orson Welles to pinpoint films of importance that he had a hand in even if he did not appear in them or direct them . The two most notable ones are AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS , which was based on a 1946 Broadway musical flop that Welles directed and starred in , and MONSIEUR VERDOUX . The former had a score ( a bad one ) by Cole Porter , and elaborate sets and tricks - and folded after a few months , plunging Welles into bankruptcy . He had to live in Europe afterward due to tax problems . Welles sold his interest in the musical to his producer Mike Todd . And Todd turned around and made his one great film out of AROUND THE WORLD in 1955 , without even offering Welles a cameo in it . In 1945-46 Welles also sold a screenplay and idea for a movie about the career of the French Bluebeard murderer Landru to Charlie Chaplin . Chaplin would have been directed by Welles , but instead ended up doing the film himself - and only remembering on giving Welles any credit when Welles pointedly reminded him about it . This was MONSIEUR VERDOUX . Henri Desire Landru was a criminal and second hand furniture dealer . He was married ( legitimately ) and from most accounts was a good husband ( except for having a mistress ) and a good father . But starting in 1917 Landru began romancing a series of middle aged women he met through the matrimonial columns of Paris newspapers , sweeping them off their feet , and then marrying them . He used several country locations ( most infamously a nice looking country villa at the town Gambais ) to take his brides for disposal : he would take them to the villa , kill them ( probably by poison or strangulation ) and then burn their bodies in a large stove / fireplace in the house . He may have chosen the villa too because it was near a convenient cemetery - a perfect place to hide corpse remains like bones . From 1917 to 1919 Landru ( as best the authorities figured out ) married 12 women and killed them and the son of one of them . He was caught when members of several of the families went to the police about the sudden disappearances of these ladies , and one of the families ran across Landru and tipped off the police . In arresting him they found he had a remarkably exact accounting system regarding the expense of each marriage including the cost of tickets to Gambais ( significantly two tickets going , but only one coming back ) . His trial in 1922 was an international event , and he did not disappoint . An exceptionally clever and even witty man , he actually made the court laugh frequently , until the evidence of mass murder became too evident . He was convicted , and guillotined . Henri Landru was bald headed and wore a spade beard . Charlie Chaplin , as Landru's screen clone " Henri Verdoux " has white hair , a fancy little mustache , and wears butterfly collars and homburg hats . He is a total dandy - and quite the charmer . He also is able to thrown himself into each different personality and role he plays as the husbands of the various victims . In actual fact he is a bank teller who lost his job - and had a crippled wife and sickly child to take care of . He pretends to be ( among other things ) a furniture dealer , a retired sea captain , an expert on jewelry ( he does show some knowledge of jewelry with one of his wives ) , and several other types of professionals . Chaplin , wisely , made most of the women Verdoux romances pretty obnoxious . But he is defeated by one of them - Annabella ( Martha Raye , in arguably her greatest comic role ) . Annabella is a wealthy ex - theater person who has a zest for life , is fairly guileless ( she is cheated by two old friends at one point ) , and has some gross physical habits that disgust the fastidious Henri . But every time he tries to kill her ( including a hysterical attempt at drowning her in a rowboat ) he gets injured or frustrated . She and only one other one of his would-be victims escape his murder plans . So does a young woman ( Marilyn Nash ) whom Landru picks up one night to experiment with using a new poison . But the young woman is so full of promise and shares some of his ideas that he lets her live . Later she will be the last woman he shares a good evening with , but by then she has become the mistress of an arms manufacturer . Chaplin used the film to rip apart the hypocrisy of modern life - we condemn the Landrus and George Joseph Smiths and Al Capones who use murder for money purposes , but we have a society that insists that building large armed forces are good ideas , that rewards arms manufacturers and perverted scientists making weapons with money and glory . Made after two world wars shattered Europe , and after the Great Depression showed the emptiness of greed , MONSIEUR VERDOUX indicted modern society as nothing else in Chaplin's work had ever done before . It is the most hopeless of his greatest films - for it ends with it's hero going to his doom , and welcoming that doom . For Verdoux knows that unless society can change ( and he doubts it will ) we will all be following him soon .
491702	3280905	162096	10.0	A Classic Criminal Novel . . . And a Splendid Black Comedy	Dr . Edmund Bickleigh is a man who is very careful and very determined . And he is especially determined to not get caught committing the perfect murder of his wife . In the end he succeeds but then finds circumstances are " agin him " . Francis Iles was an innovative detective story novelist , whose best known work ( BEFORE THE FACT ) was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock as SUSPICION and became a successful motion picture . But the film had to cripple the full effect of Iles ' novel . In his novel Johnny Aysgard ( Cary Grant in the movie ) had proved to be the murderer his wife suspected , and she ( Joan Fontaine in the movie ) became his victim . But she willingly dies to help him ( he needs the life insurance on her life to save himself from an embezzlement charge ) . He is a crushed man as a result of her sacrifice . In the film , due to problems by the studio and Grant's agent ( but not Grant , who wanted to play a villain ) Hitchcock had to change the ending so that Grant is not the murderer his wife fears , and they are reconciled to face their uncertain future together at the end . Hitchcock wanted to shoot MALICE AFORETHOUGHT with Alec Guinness as Dr . Edmund Bickleigh . The project never got put together , so it is one of those ideas of this master film maker that we can only wonder about . However , given Hitchcock's track record with comedy films ( MR . AND MRS . SMITH , THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY ) it may be just as well that he did not do this one . Iles was basing Dr . Bickleigh ( a hen-pecked country physician who turns on his wife and kills her ) on two cases which occurred within a dozen years of each other , and gave him the character's profession , the setting , and the undoing of the killer . By the sound of his name , Bickleigh is based on the hen-pecked wife killer Dr . Hawley Harvey ( " Peter " ) Crippen . But the setting in the English countryside ( Crippen killed his wife Belle in a London suburb ) is based on the murder site of Hay , near the Welsh border . In 1921 , eleven years after Crippen hanged , a solicitor named Major Herbert Armstrong was married to a strong willed wife . She was the sort of person who did not think twice of stopping a tennis game her husband was playing in , by reminding him it was time to take a bath . Armstrong poisoned his wife Katie , and successfully passed off the killing as an illness . But shortly afterward he spoiled his perfect crime . Armstrong tried to kill his rival solicitor Oswald Martin with poison at a tea party . This reopened issues about the death of Mrs . Armstrong , and her corpse was exhumed . Arsenic was found in her body , and Armstrong was arrested for her killing . After a hard fought trial he was convicted and later hanged ( he is the only lawyer hanged for murder in Great Britain in modern times ) . The combination of the two wife killers is not too difficult . Bickleigh ( Hywel Bennett ) has a hideously bossy wife ( Julia Bickleigh - Judy Parfitt ) that he would like to get rid of so he can pursue a fascinating younger woman ( Madeleine Cranmere - Cheryl Campbell ) . He does this by getting the unsuspecting wife hooked on opium . As a result he sets up the situation that she is stealing drugs from his dispensary for her habit . This will lead to her " giving herself a fatal overdose " . The killing works perfectly . But then Madeleine turns out to be more of a nymphomaniac ( and less considerate of previous promises she made to him ) than he expects . She is also seeing more of a young rival of Bickleigh's named Denny Bourne ( Christopher Guard ) . Bickleigh is angered by this - although his treatment by Madeleine is actually the same as his own dropping of his original girlfriend Ivy Ridgeway ( Bellinda Carroll ) . He is also less than happy about a rival doctor in the area ( William Chatford - David Ashford ) . He tries to get rid of Chatford , and makes the same mistake there that Armstrong did with Oswald Martin . But the difference is that Iles is rewriting history to have some fun . There is a trial of Bickleigh for the murder of his wife . But he is able ( through his barrister Sir Francis Lee - Bannermann - Thorley Walters ) to demonstrate flaw after flaw in the prosecution case . Chatford's illness was faked in a way , and this is shown to extend doubts to his veracity . Madeleine ( who in a moment of stupidity Bickleigh threatened ) is willing to testify about this , but she is shown to be neurotic and narcissistic . Ivy gives him a good defense about an alibi he needs . And then he is questioned heavily . Remaining totally cool he lies perfectly well ( as he says to himself - and the audience hears this - " And I can keep doing this until the cows come home ! " ) . Bickleigh wins acquittal . SPOILER COMING UP . Bickleigh wins up to this point . But his rival Denny Bourne has died prematurely after a picnic that Bickleigh also attended . Bickleigh is arrested and this time loses . As he hears the sentence of death being given , he realizes that the symptoms of poisoning Denny showed are similar to cholera , and he remembers that he had warned Madeleine and Denny to clean the drains of their home . He is screaming ( to nobody's attention ) , " It was the drains " as the series ended . The story was well played , particularly by the droll Bennett , who looks harmless , until one sees his eyes looking fiercely through his spectacles . Parfitt is the perfect dragon-wife , but gains our sympathy as we watch her physically collapse due to opium . Production values were good ( I especially liked the 1920 automobiles ) . The story was redone well in 2005 , but the original series was best .
492996	3280905	57012	10.0	All For Our Natural Bodily Fluids	It can safely be assumed that DR . STRANGELOVE could not have been made in the Eisenhower years . Even after Senator McCarthy's fall from public support , Ike and the Republicans ( and the Democrats ) were too involved in the politics of the Cold War to consider the ultimate point of containment and confrontation of the Soviet Union and the Communists as a subject worth laughing at . I can only think of one film , THE ATOMIC KID , that appeared in the 1950s , and somewhat spoofed nuclear disaster . In that film Mickey Rooney stumbles into a cabin stocked with supplies when he and his friend / partner Robert Strauss are looking for assistance ( their car broke down ) . Rooney is at the site when a nuclear bomb is dropped on it ( it is the target ) . He survives , and the only rationale for it is that he was eating peanut butter sandwiches . The antics of American and Russian agents get involved in that film , as does the American habit of looking for the main chance ( Strauss sees Rooney as a potential gold mine in the advertising world ) . But it is pretty lightweight stuff - and miles away from the real sense of dread surrounding STRANGELOVE . Make no mistake about this darkest of comedies . For all the humor involved , it shows the human race is so paranoid and so stupid that we will stumble very easily into our own obliteration at each other's hands . It's hard to argue with that view . And note that two years before Stanley Kubrick's film was released , the world came very close to a politically caused nuclear Armageddon in the Cuban Missile Crisis . This film remains potentially true . General Jack D . Ripper ( Sterling Hayden's role ; I love that name ) orders a secret nuclear attack on Russia because he has become convinced that the Russians are using fluoridation to undermine our virility . He has shut down the Burpleton Airforce Base ( it has a great sign - " Peace is our Business " - on the field ) , so that nobody can reach him to order the planes back . Only his British military aide , Major Lionel Mandrake ( Peter Sellers in his first of three roles ) is available ( despite Ripper's overwhelming presence ) to try to undue the damage . In the meantime other U . S . military forces tip off the Pentagon Brass and President Merton Muffly ( Sellers in his second role ) about the launching of the attack . The leading adviser on the Air Force , General Buck Turgidson ( George C . Scott ) comes into the meeting from enjoying his bodily fluids ( he tells the girl to say her prayers ) . Scott is taken to task by Muffly about the failure of a comprehensive psychiatric test for upper level officers that failed to reveal General Ripper was insane . Turgidson suggests that one failure does not disprove the system doesn't work . Muffley is also turned off by Turgidson's suggestions that rather than stop Ripper's attack , we should go fully ballistic on the U . S . S . R . " I can promise , " Turgidson rattles off , " thirty million U . S . casualties tops ! " Muffley tries to prepare the Russians - he invites their ambassador De Sadeski ( Peter Bull ) to the Pentagon War Room , and he tries to warn the drunken Russian Premier , Dimitri Kissoff , but has to reduce his serious warning to almost a fairy tale ( " Well . . . one of our generals went a little funny in the head . " ) . The contemporary serious film FAILSAFE had similar problems emerge when a computer system erroneously triggers an attack . The President there ( Henry Fonda ) was not confronted by as many forms of idiocy as Seller's Muffley ( including his own ) . Fonda actually does reach the planes but they refuse to believe he is President . Muffley too gets to the planes ( once he gets the correct code used ) but one plane has a busted radio and never hears him . That is the plane of Major " King " Kong ( Slim Pickens ) , who has the most famous last fatal ride in cinematic history . Most of the figures in DR . STRANGELOVE are based on real life figures . Muffley was based on Adlai Stevenson , a well-intentioned man who twice ran for President , but couldn't sell himself ( against Eisenhower , who could ? ) . Ripper ( forgetting who his name is based on ) is based on General Edward Walker who openly espoused anti-fluoridation and John Birch politics in his job . Turgidson is based on General Curtis LeMay , a great Air Force figure from World War II , but too openly anti-Russian in the Cold War . De Sadesky ( who shows a sneaky side twice in the film ) seems based on Andrei Gromyko , the Russian Ambassador to the U . S . in the Missile Crisis . Kissoff may be based on Nikita Khrustchev . And then there is Strangelove ( Sellers in the best of his three performances ) . A neo - Nazi scientist transported to the U . S . ( a beneficiary of " Operation Paper Clip " at the end of World War II , where scientists like Werner Von Braun ended up in the U . S . for our military's purposes ) , he has elements of Von Braun and Edward Teller , the Hungarian-born scientist ( so-called father of the Hydrogen bomb ) who hated the Communists or anyone who might start defending them ( he did a number on J . Robert Oppenheimer ) . Anyone else ? There has been a persistent suggestion that Strangelove is based on Henry Kissinger , but this seems not to be true . Certainly the crippled madman , with his mechanical arm that won't behave itself ( it keeps " heiling " ) is one of a kind , suggesting a sexual paradise in the future within the abandoned gold mines and cold mines of America . At the end he rises from his wheelchair without thinking , and suddenly announces , " Mein Fuhrer . . . I can walk ! " In the thermonuclear age as Armageddon advances our leader shows he has barely stopped being a crawling baby ! ! For the sake of that performance alone the film is worth seeing . Definitely worth seeing for the performances of the whole cast and Kubrick's directorial excellence .
492266	3280905	93981	10.0	The 1946 Alcatraz Revolt	This tightly made television drama dealt with an incident that made national headlines for a week or so in 1946 and then disappeared ( except for some subsequent trials ) from public attention . It was the closest thing to a large scale escape plan from Alcatraz Prison that ever occurred , and left most of the prisoners in the lead dead , and some of the survivors headed for fast trials and executions . The ringleaders were Bernie Coy and Robert Hubbard ( David Carridine and David Morse ) two lifers who had committed murder , but were not hardened criminals in the sense of having vicious streaks . Coy and Hubbard were both country boys ( in gun battles they killed peace officers , but both escaped the death penalty ) . They both wanted to return home , and the best bet was a carefully laid out scheme that would enable them to take over one of the largest blocks of the prison , and capture a certain number of police officers for hostage purposes . The weakness of the scheme was that they had to rely on others who were not as reasonable as they were - especially one prisoner , Dutch Cretzer ( Howard Hesseman - in an unusual and very good performance as a totally vicious type ) . Cretzer too had managed to escape a death penalty so far , but was in for life . He happened to have hidden assets outside the prison , and was needed for escape purposes . But for both Coy and Hubbard it was like a deal with the devil . As the Warden Johnston ( Richard Dysart ) says of Cretzer , " He'd kill his own mother if it would get him out of prison . " Cretzer insisted ( really insisted - you didn't question his ideas much for health reasons ) that two of his closest pals on the Rock be used too - Sam Shockley ( a bad-tempered half wit , played well by Charles Haid ) and Buddy Thompson ( Jan - Michael Vincent ) who was willing to carry out a vicious order if Cretzer gave it . One can see that Coy and Hubbard had their hands full . They also had one young guy in the scheme who was not as bad as the others , a Latino named Dan Durando ( Paul Sanchez ) , who would nearly go to the gas chamber because of his involvement here . The film shows how the scheme is put into operation - how some of the police are caught off guard , and captured by Coy and Hubbard , who are forced to turn over the guards ( at Cretzer's insistence ) to Shockley and Thompson , with Durando standing guard . They get about a dozen hostages . Then they contact the Warden with their demands - for a boat to the mainland so they can get to an awaiting fast automobile Cretzer has put at their disposal . Warden Johnston stalls for time to think of how to stop them without risking the lives of the hostages . But Cretzer and the others are now fully armed , and it is difficult . Moreover the design of that impregnable prison is working against the prison authorities here . Johnston is lucky enough to get some army material from the local military head in the San Francisico area ( it was General " Vinigar Joe " Stillwell ) in the form of heavy anti-tank weapons ( bazookas ) and heavy rifles . And a stalemate seems to be developing , which drives Cretzer to greater and greater anger - to the point that he thinks they might as well show they mean business by killing the hostages . He orders Shockley and Thompson to do so , and soon there is a bloodbath in the cells ( when Durando won't act , Shockley tells him that if he doesn't he , Shockley , will tell the police it was Durando's idea ! ) . However , Durando discovers that several of the police are badly wounded but alive . He manages to convince Shockley , Thompson , and Cretzer that they were all killed . This enabled several of the wounded to survive - and prevented Durando from sharing the fate of Shockley and Thompson at their trials . Once Johnston realizes the hostages were shot , he orders a full scale assault on the block that is in revolt . It becomes a battle royal with anti-tank shells piercing the walls . Many prisoners in the block had not joined the fight , and they were endangered . It was here that an unexpected hero showed up - Robert Stroud ( Dennis Farina ) who got a message to the Warden that he was threatening the lives of innocent men . Johnston re - concentrated the fire after that on the area where the six were hold up . This event actually was shown in another film briefly - in Burt Lancaster's biography of Stroud , THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ , the revolt is shown ( Telly Savalas is Cretzer and Lancaster is the man who saved the day ) . The film then follows the inevitable collapse and defeat of the revolt , and the death of it's leaders ( and the fate of Durando , who years later was released from prison ) . It was a very well done prison film , and a poignant one ( surprisingly ) in the performances of Carridine and Morse , who one wishes had either never planned it or had never had to depend on a monster like Hesseman to get it going . If they show it again try to catch it .
493402	3280905	43137	10.0	The Travels of a Magnificent Rifle	In 1942 a film TALES OF MANHATTAN told a set of stories that were basically unrelated , but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear . Each story began when the " tails " were passed from one owner ( Charles Boyer , for instance ) to another ( Ceasar Romero ) . WINCHESTER ' 73 , a superior film , and a great western , has a similar plot twist . Initially it is about how Jimmy Stewart is seeking Stephen ( Horace ) MacMahon for some deadly grudge . But in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest , the prize ( given by Marshall Wyatt Earp - Will Geer ) being one of the new Winchester rifles . Stewart barely beats out MacMahon , but the gun is stolen from Stewart , and the chase is on . The gun passes from hand to hand , including John McIntyre ( as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant ) , to Rock Hudson ( in a surprising role - and a brief one at that ) , to Charles Drake , to Dan Duryea ( as the delightfully deadly and psychotic Waco Johnny Dean ) , to MacMahon . Eventually it does return to Stewart . The film is expertly directed by Anthony Mann . Every character has a wide variety of experiences . Duryea gets the rifle literally over Drake's dead body ( Duryea forces the issue ) . But he loses it to MacMahon , who is faster on the draw - not that Duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle . As he and Shelley Winter look at MacMahon in the distance , Winter ( who watched Duryea kill her former boy friend Drake ) drops her distaste for the gunman momentarily to ask why he put up with MacMahon's bullying for the gun . Philosophically , Duryea explains he can wait . Some opportunity will come up later on ( i . e . , when he can safely kill MacMahon and get back the rifle ) . The characters are remarkably human . Winters first appears as the future bride of Drake , but she sees a really big negative side to him - an unforgivable side . Drake is aware of this lapse , and it helps lead to his destruction . Other characters have realistic touches , such as J . C . Flippen as an army sergeant who fights an Indian attack with Steward and Steward's friend Millard Mitchell . Oh yes , and with Flippen's fellow soldier - Tony Curtis . Flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before , since 1861 probably . Steward had showed emotions in other films . In IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE he showed a degree of anger at times , and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life . But here he showed a demonic anger - at the expense of a surprised Duryea ( who normally would show such anger himself ) . The parts of this film fit very neatly together , under Mann's competent hands . This is one western that never wears out , as the audience watches the travels of a Winchester rifle .
493058	3280905	109190	10.0	A Kidnapping Planned by Three Wiley Coyotes	This film never fails to be funny . The plot is simple - a variant on the two McCauley Culkin HOME ALONE films or O'Henry's THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF , except the protagonist is an adorable baby . Three criminals led by Joe Mantegna have been committing fairly successful robberies at convenience stores and even banks . They find that a wealthy family's baby is going to be photographed on a particular day for a magazine , and they arrive at the mansion as the photographers and kidnap the baby . They intend to collect a large ransom . What they don't count on is that the baby , by instinct and sheer chance , is smarter than all three men together . The baby's favorite book has a kind of daily itinerary , and the baby ( after accidentally escaping the three idiots ) follows it . He is usually only one step ahead of the idiots , so they constantly find him - only to fall on their faces ( or worse ) while he continues with hardly a scratch . All ends well for the baby at the end . The supporting cast is quite good , in particular Fred Dalton Thomas as the FBI man , John Neville as the household's major domo , Lara Flynn Boyle as the heart-sick mother ( the only really unfunny , realistic aspect to the film ) , and Cynthia Nixon as the nanny . But the chief kudos go to Adam and Jacob Worton as Baby Bink , and Mantegna and his two cohorts Brian Haley and Joe Pantoliano . Of the three men Mantegna is clearly the sharpest , but that does not say much . The clearest comparison of this film is with the Road Runner cartoons of Chuck Jones , with Mantegna , Haley , and Pantoliano trying to use their superior grown-up cleverness to simply recapture Baby Bink . The problem is that their methods are so complicated for themselves that they cannot but fail . They follow the baby into the zoo , and rather than simply scooping the kid up by racing to him , they let him head into the monkey house , and are soon being thrown around by a wise and protective gorilla . The chase the baby into the park , and ( incredibly ) they do get their hands on him , but two policemen come to them with some questions and Mantegna has to hide the baby under his coat . The baby uses his lighter to set fire to his testicles ( and Mantegna has to restrain screaming until the police leave the scene , which is a priceless moment ) . The script manages to top it - to put out the fire Mantegna's two assistant crooks put it out the way you put out a campfire ( they stamp it out ! ) . To me the highpoint is when Baby Bink goes into a construction site . None of the construction workers notice the baby at all , but our three anti-heroes do . They proceed to keep missing the baby and end up falling into cement troughs or into refuse dumps . Mantegna adds the one truest moment out of Wile E . Coyote's fights with Roadrunner . He jumps onto a huge crane's arm , holding onto a battering ball . His intention ( as the crane was headed downward ) is to have an " elevator " descent by the crane to the ground . Just as he lands on the ball , the face on all the clocks in the construction site hit five o'clock , a whistle blows , and the machines ( including the crane ) are all turned off at once , and the crews all leave the site . The sequence ends with the sun setting in back of the clinging Mantegna waiting to figure out how to get down . For pure malicious , destructive delight , BABY'S DAY OUT can barely be touched .
492862	3280905	25907	10.0	The Best Version of the Best Known Stevenson Story	When Robert Louis Stevenson wrote TREASURE ISLAND in 1883 , he probably thought that it was a good work , but hardly better than his TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY or SILVERADO SQUATTERS or his other coming fiction . It was a good early novel , and that was that . He would grow as a writer , but THE MASTER OF BALLENTRAE , DR . JECKYLL AND MR . HYDE , and WEIR OF HERMISTON were in the future , as was KIDNAPPED . So were the forgotten titles : PRINCE OTTO and THE WRECKERS and THE DYNAMITERS . But his best themes are in TREASURE ISLAND . Besides the expert handling of an adventure tale and a historical novel , there is also the issue of ambiguity in personality . Long John Silver is the first of a line of heroes / anti-heroes including Dr . Henry Jeckyll , Alec Breck Stewart , and James and Henry Durrie who while decent in some ways are weak or worse in other ways . Long John is capable of organizing a mutiny , ordering the murder of a troublesome crew member who won't join his plans , or planning to steal a treasure that does not belong to him . But he is human - he sees young Jim Hawkins as a decent kid , and ends up becoming a surrogate father to him in the novel ( even protecting the boy from his less pleasant associates ) . But Long John cannot avoid ( even at his best ) being at his worse . To protect Jim , John has to keep him from the other non-mutineers ( the Squire , Captain Smollett , Dr . Livesey ) , so he lies to Jim that they have denounced Jim as a mutineer and won't have anything to do with him . Subsequently , of course , Jim does learn this is a lie - from Dr . Livesey . Jim likewise finds ambiguity in his reactions . He can't help liking ( even loving ) the sea cook . But he realizes Silver is a bad man . Yet , in the end , he is glad that John escapes ( even with some part of the treasure ) . In his autobiography , Jackie Cooper admits that when he is approached to this day by fans they start asking him about Wallace Beery , and Cooper has to admit that he never was close to Beery socially . They worked well together ( Cooper played Beery's son in THE CHAMP , the 1931 film that gave Beery his Oscar ) . But Beery's personality ( in real life ) was always " troublesome " . Reputedly he left the budding film industry in Chicago in the teens of the 20th Century when he was in danger of a rape charge . In later years his failed marriage to Gloria Swanson was due to his jealousy of her success and his slower success . When he worked with Cooper , he was at his Hollywood zenith as a star and talent , but he was fully aware of it . At one point , Cooper mentions an incident where Beery , he , and some others were eating lunch , and some autograph seekers approached them . While several ( including Cooper ) did not hesitate to give autographs , Beery refused . Afterwards , when asked about this , Beery said that he was a big star and he did not have to be pestered by this kind of thing . Yet , to the credit of both stars , their performances in TREASURE ISLAND are flawless . They get along very nicely in their roles - Jim Hawkins occasionally saying something kindly that raises the suspicious John Silver's spirits a bit . Beery and Cooper also perform well with the rest of the cast - check the scenes where Beery keeps his less and less friendly mutineer associates in line . He brings some dark humor to the situations ( as when a treasure that they dig for is not in the spot they've waisted time at ) . Cooper's best moment without Beery , of course , is the sequence with Douglas Dumbrille as Israel Hands , where they have a fight to the death ( literally ) in the rigging of the ship Hands was supposed to be guarding . Dumbrille , by the way , should be congratulated for his acting here - he manages not to show off that stentorian voice of his , but uses a more weaselly sounding voice quite effectively . Note also Lionel Barrymore's noisy and frightening , but ultimately frightened Captain Billy Bones , forcing the civilians in the Admiral Benbow Inn to sing " Fifteen Men on a Deadman's Chest " , but quivering when told the one legged sea cook has been seen nearby . Also note William Mong's " Blind Pew " , a scary enough figure for awhile , but at the end rather pathetic given his bizarre fate . Chic Sale's Ben Gunn is properly silly from years of isolation . Otto Kruger's Dr . Livesay is properly heroic seeking to make sure that Jim is not harmed by the mutineers . The cast , in short , is first rate , and matched by Victor Fleming's well handled directing . So the film merits a " 10 " . Historically , there was a pirate named Israel Hands , though he was dead by the time of TREASURE ISLAND ( roughly 1740 ) . Hands was one of Blackbeard's crew in 1716 - 1718 , and was the only survivor of that crew from Blackbeard's last battle in 1718 . The pirate chief shot him in the knee , wounding him severely enough to keep from fighting . Hands was put ashore before the battle , and watched while his mates were killed or captured ( and eventually hanged ) . Hands died years later as a beggar in London . Oh , and the inn , " the Admiral Benbow " is named for Admiral John Benbow ( died 1702 ) who was a hero of the Navy in the period of the War of the Spanish Succession .
492180	3280905	60588	10.0	The Lone Figure On Top of the Staircase Facing the Armed Mob	The war against the Mahdists in the Sudan , the first modern confrontation between the so-called " Liberal / Christian " west and the " Arab / Islamic " east was the subject of several films , but one is KHARTOUM , concerning the initial incidents of the war , and several of the other are the several versions of FOUR FEATHERS , concerning the events leading to the final defeat of the Mahdists in 1898 at Omdurmann . The film THE LIGHT THAT FAILED takes place ( in part ) in the early part of the war , when the British were slowly re-advancing to Khartoum and Omdurmann . KHARTOUM deals with the events from 1883 to January 1885 , when a fanatical Islamic fundamentalist known as " the Mahdi " arose in the backwater of the Sudan , preaching destruction of the infidels who were controlling Islam , and eventual domination of the globe by a reinvigorated Islam led by himself . This figure was actually Mohammad Ahmed , a Dongolese of Islamic ancestry . He claimed he was " the Mahdi " , meaning the awaited one - a type of Islamic messiah who was supposed to restore the glory of that religion in it's pure form . It was not too hard to get support in the Sudan , who were upset at English interference in the slave trade ( which was big business in the Sudan ) and with the political control given to the Khedive of Egypt . A combination of profit and nationalism gave him his real strength , mixed by religious fanaticism . And it was quite effective . He was able to destroy ( literally obliterate ) an army of Egyptian soldiers and English officers led by William Hicks in 1883 . It sparked the revolt's success . In lieu of what happened , particularly to Gordon in 1885 , one can say that the Islamic forces were truthfully dynamic . Actually , they were blown out of proportion . In 1882 the Egyptian army and government were split by an anti-English revolt led by a Colonel Arabi Pasha . Arabi nearly overthrew the Khedive , but the English finally beat him . But Arabi's supporters included many leading Egyptian officers . Hicks ( not the swiftest officer himself ) was not in charge of many good officers , and the massacre was easily achieved . Prime Minister William Gladstone was opposed to imperialist ventures , but he was saddled with the Suez Canal ( which the British partly owned ) . When the Mahdi's threat expanded Gladstone begrudgingly gave into public opinion of sending General George Charles Gordon to the Sudan . Gladstone wanted Gordon to simply close Britain's military mission there . But Gordon , as pointed out in another review on this thread , was a fanatical supporter of Christianity , and an opponent of the slavery supported by the Mahdi . He agreed to go , but he planned to pull Britain's military presence into the area at a stronger pace . The result was a curious three way tug of war , where the Mahdi occasionally was allied with Prime Minister Gladstone , against Gordon's prevarications and delays , but Gladstone would fumblingly be brought back into line because Gordon was a popular hero and an opponent of the slave trade . Still , his uncertain steps doomed Gordon-the relief of Khartoum ( under General Wolsey ) began too late and arrived a week after the tragedy played out . Despite all his defense measures , Gordon saw the Mahdi's forces enter the governor's palace . Standing at the head of the staircase facing them he was speared by one of the Mahdists . Gordon became enshrined as a Christian martyr . Gladstone , previously nicknamed the " Grand Old Man " ( G . O . M . ) became the " M . O . G . " ( " Murderer of Gordon " ) . Gladstone was tossed out of office within half a year . The Mahdi had plans to expand to Cairo , then Constantinople and Mecca , and ( eventually ) every capital in Europe and North and South America . He presumably did not realize just how far he really could have driven his forces ( they just did not have the military hardware for this ) . In any event , he began to set himself up as an old fashioned Caliph , with a harem . For the next year he sexually enjoyed himself , and got fat . Unfortunately , the area of Khartoum and the new capital of Omdurmann was not exactly cleaned of the remains of battle . Plague soon spread among the Sudanese , and the Mahdi ( weakened by his excesses ) died . With him really died the first attempt at a universal Muslim Jihad against the west . His successor , " The Khalifa " was not as charismatic . Charleton Heston plays Gordon as a man of firm conviction , who realizes that his enemy ( Laurence Olivier as " the Mahdi " ) is as capable in checking his moves as any can be feared , and is as firm in the spreading of his religion's power as Gordon is about Christianity . Olivier ( as pointed out elsewhere , using the voice he used as OTHELLO ) is impressed with Heston as an opponent , but is sure of his ultimate victory - but he intended to save Gordon , and the film ends with his horror at finding that Gordon was killed against his orders . The fury of his followers has overcome his leadership , and brings the world down on his head . Ralph Richardson looks remarkably like Gladstone , and shows the idealist who hated the imperial system left to him by his hated rival Disraeli , and yet was a subtle politician ( look at the way he signals to Granville ( Michael Hordern ) after assuring assistance to Gordon - he does not totally mean it ) . Richard Johnson is good as Gordon's loyal assistant who tries to rally the Prime Minister's conscience . With a stirring theme music score , KHARTOUM is a memorable historical account for movie audiences .
492995	3280905	37800	10.0	A Determined Young Woman Discovers There May Be More To Life	Wendy Hiller's career was a long one , first lucking out by appearing as the heroines in the first two Gabriel Pascal versions of Bernard Shaw's plays " Pygmalion " and " Major Barbara " , and then doing regular film and stage work . Along the way she would also get an Oscar for best supporting actress in " Separate Tables " . She would still be appearing in television and movies up to the end . Never a really pretty woman ( her supporting co-star in " Major Barbara " , Deborah Kerr , actually was far better looking - and would have more romantic roles ) , Hiller ended in pretty rich character parts . Example : her Russian Gramd Duchess in " Murder On The Orient Express " . The real exception to her lack of a romantic lead role is not ' Liza Doolittle in " Pygmalion " . It is Joan Webster in the Powell and Pressburger film " I Know Where I'M Going " . She is a lively and intelligent woman , but fairly ordinary looking . Which may explain why her romantic partner in this film is Roger Livesey ( as Torquil Macneil ) . Livesey is a distinguished actor too , but hardly a handsome man . The two balance very nicely . Joan , we are told , was alway assured about how to manage her life from the age of ten . She intended from her youth to marry well ( i . e . , a man of wealth and position ) . And we learn that she is now headed for the Hebrides in northern Scotland . Her fiancé is a wealthy man building a mansion on an island up there . He plans to marry her in the mansion . It seems a reasonable set up , until Joan reaches the one port across the narrow seas ( about fifteen miles ) from the island . It seems the seas are quite rough , and the weather is not calming down yet . It would be suicidal to take a small row boat across the sea in this weather . Joan is flummoxed by this , as she had no plans to spend much time in the seaport . What follows is the slow re-education of Joan . Firstly she finds her admiration for her rich boyfriend is not universal . Most of the locals think of him as a stranger or a fool ( one can't imagine why he wants a swimming pool on his island mansion - he has the entire ocean around him to swim in ! ) . Then she discovers that these common people have lives of interest and intensity of their own . And the person who is awakening her to this slow realization is Torquil . A local Laird , he has much personal interaction with the people , who give him their respect and affection , but he is ( like many nobles ) land poor ( he has some land , but no money ) . Torquil is capable of lecturing Joan ( when she still tries to get to that island if she can get one of the locals risk it ) , berating her for risking the lives of some others by promises of money they need . But he also keeps showing the small joys of the locals , such as their dances and anniversaries . He also shows her the ruins of the ancient kingdom of Scotland , including a tower where a lovers ' tragedy occurred in the far distant past . And slowly Joan begins to realize that perhaps she should look at less pragmatic reasons to marry . " I Know Where I'm Going " is not as well remembered as later Powell and Pressburger films like " A Matter Of Life And Death " ( " Stairway To Heaven " ) , " Black Narcissus " ( in my opinion their masterpiece ) , or " The Red Shoes " . But it is the equal of these films as entertainment , and deserves continued viewing by modern audiences .
491820	3280905	28102	10.0	Getting the spirit of Pelham Granville Wodehouse right !	When one reads Wodehouse novels and short stories one is in a world of gentlemen's clubs , social lion aunts and tyrannical mothers , henpecked husbands , merchants who are overly proud of their products ( in one short story the rich uncle deals in jute and has a house decorated in models of birds made out of his product ) , would-be dictators of England who have family fortunes based on woman's lingerie , Earls who are more concerned about prize winning pigs than propriety , bartenders who have funds of stories to illustrate life with , butlers who are smarter than the aristocrats around them , idiot scions of noble houses who convince their potential in-laws of their good intentions by swallowing dog biscuits ( which the in-laws manufacture ) , brilliant social tacticians whose schemes always come apart at the end , and golf lovers - always golf lovers . You rarely find a comment on the real world - the nobleman who made money from ladies underwear was an exception ( a satire on Sir Oswald Mosley ) . But his variations on the artificial world of the rich and the powerful works a charm to this day . Unlike so many of his contemporary fellow novelists his works are still largely in print ( mostly through the British publisher Penguin ) . And Wodehouse wrote over 100 books ! It is a great formula , but it can be spoiled . Arthur Treacher played Jeeves , the great butler , in two forgettable comedies in the 1930s ( one with David Niven as Bertie Wooster ) did not make a great impression due to poor productions . But a film like A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS or this version of PICADILLY JIM shows how it's done properly . The characters are not arch or overdone - but they all take themselves seriously . Montgomery is a night person , enjoying the nightclubs and such . But he does remember to have a caricature ready for his newspaper , folded in the pocket of his coat . Eric Blore is the perfect butler , trying to awaken his employer using bird calls ( a talent he would also display with amusing results in IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER ) . But he is intelligent and loyal . When Cora Witherspoon's Mrs . Pett makes a sneering comment on Jim's formidable abilities as a caricaturist ( as opposed to a real artist like Leonardo or Raphael ) , Blore's butler Bayliss boils over and rattles off a list of great artists who were gifted caricaturists , such as Daumier and Thomas Nast , and ending with Goya . Frank Morgan has not performed on stage in 20 years , but he is proud of his greatest role - as Osric in Hamlet ( Peter Cushing in the Olivier film , and Robin Williams in Keneth Branagh's version ) . He uses it ( successfully ) to fool the Petts into accepting him into their family , while he secretly romances Mrs . Pett's younger sister ( Billie Burke - the only one who realizes the truth in the masquerade ) . In Wodehouse the road to love is never easy . Robert Montgomery makes a successful comic strip out of the Pett family ( Witherspoon , Grant Mitchell , and Tommy Bupp ) in revenge for their snootiness ( actually it is the snootiness of Witherspoon - she thinks Morgan is a fortune hunter , and Mitchell is her henpecked husband who goes along with her ; the boy Ogden Pett is one of those obnoxious kids in Wodehouse who enliven his books - actually Ogden is thoughtless and rude , but he actually thinks it's cool that he's in a comic strip ) . Montgomery learns that Madge Blake , the woman he loves , is angry at the comic strip and it's artist . He has to try to undue the damage his successful strip has done to try to win Madge back . The film is a sparkling little drink of champagne , which the best of Wodehouse usually is . It's nice to see that for a change , Hollywood got the literary property's spirit right .
491605	3280905	69865	10.0	Another Don Siegel Thriller Masterpiece - and Walter Matthau Shows What His Villains Might Have Done	I always had a small wish , now totally impossible to consider doing . Up to the time Cary Grant died in the 1980s I wished he , Audrey Hepburn , and Walter Matthau could have re-shot the conclusion of CHARADES . Matthau played one of his excellent villains , although with comic moments . But after 1964 Matthau won a place in our hearts as Whiplash Willy Gingrich , Oscar Madison , Horace Vandergelder , and dozens of other curmudgeons . They were crooked at times , and could be nasty - but they were nasty to the idiots that annoy us . So I reedited the end of CHARADES , so that Walter Matthau remained Hamilton Bartholemew of the State Department , and Cary Grant was Carson Dial . Matthau , somehow blundering into saving Hepburn's Mrs . Lambert at the end would have been as memorable a conclusion as the actual film's end today - possibly more so . In 1964 Walter Matthau rarely played heroes . His wise television executive who tells off a destroyed but scheming Andy Griffith in A FACE IN THE CROWD was an exception . But afterward , with a well deserved Oscar for Willy , Matthau got better leading roles , as well as film partnership with his perfect " fencing " mate Jack Lemmon . As one of the fans of the evil as well as the " shady-nice " Matthau , I have often wondered if he could have appeared as more of a conniver and schemer ( outside of Billy Wilder's films ) in his later career . The answer ( outside of Wilder ) is found in this film , CHARLIE VARRICK . It is surprising that Matthau apparently disliked it , but he may have felt that it was too mechanical ( thrillers , like melodramas , can be like that ) . But it enabled him to play a man who was not beyond planning or setting up deadly violence for his own sake . And he gets away with it in the end . This film suggests a possible career twist that Matthau never had to follow , but could easily have been his had the motion picture business of the 1960s - 2000 been run like it had been run in the heyday of the studios . Just like the typecasting of Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre , one can imagine the typecasting of Walter Matthau in such roles as Charlie Varrick back in the 1930s - 1950s . Varrick and his wife had been in a daredevil airplane act for years , but found less and less jobs . So they turn ( with their mechanic and Harmon Sullivan - Andy Robinson ) into small town bank robbers . But the bank they rob turns out to be a nightmare . There is a shoot out with unexpected local police ( headed by William Schallert ) . Schallert is wounded and a deputy killed , but so was Varrick's old mechanic and Varrick's wife . Varrick is able to transfer himself and the bank loot , and Harmon to a truck , and Harmon blows up the getaway car . Varrick and Harmon go to their home in a trailer park , and discovers that the money in the bags is far more than the $10 , 000 . 00 or so they expected ( it is more like $750 , 000 . 00 ) . When Varrick hears of the robbery report on the news , he learns a much smaller amount is reported stolen . Varrick soon realizes it is an illegal bank - a Mafia drop off bank . In the meantime , a hit-man named Molly ( Joe Don Baker , in a wonderful sociopath performance ) has been hired by the Mob to go after the thieves . But he has considered that it is odd that the bank robbery occurred when it did - just after the Mob sent so much money to the bank for money laundering purposes . He tells his contact ( Benson Fong ) of his suspicions , and Fong and he agree to include the head of the bank ( John Vernon ) as a leading suspect . Varrick has problems with his partner Harmon , who wants the money split now ( wise old Charlie realizes they have to wait at least ten years to do it safely , and they have to spend it very slowly not to raise any suspicions ) . Harmon warns Charlie not to cross him . Charlie , disgusted and angry , says , " Okay Harmon , you're calling the shots " . He subsequently leaves a drunken Harmon with no clothes and no money . Harmon can't do anything because he may be targeted now by the mob . Varrick sets things up to hide his own identity , tampering with his dental records ( and switching his records with Harmon's , whose file he removes ) . He starts studying the situation , and notes the involvement of the bank President , his local representative ( Woodrow Parfrey ) and Molly . Varrick decides to manipulate the mobsters into destroying Harmon and each other . And , due to the personalities of the characters involved , Varrick triumphs in the end . One can just imagine - thinking of Matthau's cleverness and ruthlessness in this plot - how he could have been the anti-hero of a series of B features in an earlier period of film history . You have to watch it to appreciate the Don Siegel " touch " as well , such as the scene where John Vernon frightens Woodrow Parfrey with images of torture with an electric cattle prod , and the various scenes of Molly's handling characters like a crippled wheelchair bound informant . Events mesh effortlessly into each other , and there is no wasted time . This is one thriller that never loses it's effectiveness .
493001	3280905	43014	10.0	Alright Mr . DeMille , I'm ready for my close-up .	It is among the best and most tragic exit lines in film . And it also leads directly to the best conclusion ( I feel ) in movies in terms of proper cinematography : the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness . Rarely does a film end so satisfactorily and perfectly . SUNSET BLVD . was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame . A STAR IS BORN had done so in the in 1937 . It showed how as a star is nurtured by the system to great fame , another prominent star descends into oblivion and death . So why ( if the story theme was not new ) was SUNSET BLVD . such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950 ? It boiled down to this : the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main ( although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance ) . Norman had always had a drinking problem which he never controlled . Norma was not into that - she was always into a healthy physical lifestyle ( except for smoking ) , but the effect of her publicity and the fan mail pushed her egomania to great heights . It made her so egocentric that she can only think of the people around her in her immediate cycle as the greatest representatives of all those millions of unseen fans - the wonderful people out there in the dark . They are there for her adoration only . Norman Main , in comparison , did find a measure of happiness in Vicki Lester , whom he discovered and helped to find her true potential . He was more selfless , to the point ( as it turned out ) of self-destruction . Not really like Norma Desmond . To her people are there to serve Gods and Goddesses called stars . One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester . Joe and Vicki were both ambitious , but Joe really wasn't as interested in Norma ( aside from giving him room , board , and a temporary job ) , as Vicki was in Norman . There was a mutual attraction there ( Norman was not incredibly older than Vicki , as opposed to Norma's older age compared to Joe's ) . Joe also had his girlfriend / collaborator Betty Schaeffer . Vicki had no other lover on the outside - it was only Norman . That is why , when he commits suicide , Vicki goes into seclusion . There is a triangular figure in SUNSET BLVD . for Norma , in her butler Max Von Mayerling . He had been her first director and husband , and he is also ( in his over-devotion to her ) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy . It is a sign of her insanity that she never notices that the letters are written by the same hand . Wilder had used Eric Von Stroheim in FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO as Rommel , so he knew what it was like working with him . Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max ( like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes ) which Wilder managed to push aside . Von Stroheim's performance ( one of his greatest ) was not harmed by these cuts , although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained . But by reducing the neurotic behavior of Max ( to just his pathetic need to be near Norma to support her ) it keeps us concentrating on Norma's psychosis - where it should be . Norma is the driving force to the end , pulling the wires that manipulate Max , Joe , Betty , even ( out of a sense of pity ) Cecil B . DeMille and his production staff ( example : the light man " Hogeye " ) . Even with the " waxwork " friends who crop up for cards , Norma seems to be in control ( they all congregate to see her - the richest among them ) . Even with people who are supposedly independent ( the funeral home people who cater to her burying her pet monkey ; the salesman on commission who urges Joe to buy the vicuña coat ) she manages to keep this control . She is the central sun / " Star " in this galaxy - and cannot brook any deviation . The rejection of the ungrateful Joe can only be appeased physically by his death , and emotionally by her mind clouding that failure and it's aftermath from her memory . From the start of the film , with all her egocentricity at work , only a psychic slap in the face was missing to complete the tragedy . Then she was finally ready for that close-up .
492815	3280905	33532	10.0	Wonderful combination of Americana and Morality Tale	THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER was one of several films that appeared in 1940 - 41 that were eventually acknowledged as great films but were , in their day , hidden in the shadows of at least three or four other films : GONE WITH THE WIND , STAGECOACH , THE GRAPES OF WRATH , and CITIZEN KANE . These films were stretching the way movies were being made , and they were also sharing technological and production values . For example , the use of shadows this film resembles the use of them in KANE , and the questioning of American values is in all the four films . Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benet ( the author of JOHN BROWN'S BODY ) , it follows how Mr . Scratch ( the traditional New England name for the Devil ) is picking up contracts with the locals , thus gaining their souls in return for temporary success . One of the locals is Jabez Stone ( James Craig , in the biggest role of his career ) . He is married to Mary Stone ( Anne Shirley ) , and lives on a farm that is not too successful with Mary and his mother Ma Stone ( Jane Darwell ) . However , Mary is pregnant , so Jabez is desperate to turn his farm around . But nothing is working , and he owes money to the local moneylender , Miser Stevens ( John Qualen ) . So when Scratch shows up , a contract is set up to give Stone seven years of prosperity for his soul . This is done with a real contract , but a tree is turned into a living symbol ( and reminder ) of the day the contract comes due and Stone has to yield his soul . Stone prospers - he pays off Stevens , but the Miser recognizes the gold used as identical to the gold that he has been using ever since he made a similar contractual agreement . He also begins to get corrupt in his behavior - from being helpful to his neighbors he starts being as greedy as Miser Stevens when he lends them money ( and gradually takes over their land ) . He picks up a mistress Belle Dee ( Simone Simone ) courtesy of the " helpful " Scratch , thus alienating his wife and mother . He builds the best mansion in New Hampshire , and alienates all the local gentry by his pretensions . The seven years end and Stone begins panicking . He realizes that his soul is far more valuable than the Devil told him . When he tries to cut down the tree , Scratch confronts him . He does offer Stone a chance to extend the contract , if Stone agrees to his son becoming an acolyte of the Devil . Stone hears that the great orator , lawyer , and Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster is visiting his native New Hampshire ( Webster was born in New Hampshire , but served as Senator from neighboring Massachusetts where he had moved ) . Webster agrees to defend Stone . This leads to the great climax where Webster addresses his defense to a jury of the damned ( containing pirates Captain Kidd , Blackbeard , and Stede Bonnit ) . The resolution of the contract by the jury completes the film . Walter Huston is shown to best advantage in this film , playing the Devil , Mr . Scratch , and being a typical New Englander ( he even beats a drum in a marching band occasionally ) . It is apparent that he is enjoying this performance closely . Note the concluding shot of him in the film , looking for his next " customer " . And he did get nominated for the best actor Oscar role . Just as good is Edward Arnold as Webster . He was actually replacing Thomas Mitchell , injured in an accident . Arnold's Webster is actually an excellent performance , but he is not the historical Webster . First of all , as some of Webster's historical observers have noted - the " Divine " Daniel was very pro - business , and a big supporter of contracts . Here he is trying to destroy a contract . Not realistic historically . However , his political ambition ( he wanted to be President , but never got elected ) is shown , as is his biggest weakness : Webster was an alcoholic , and his love of " Mumford Rum " is shown twice in the film : Once when he is drinking some on a hot day at a public occasion when he was supposed to be giving a speech , and secondly just before he starts addressing the jury . ( Webster got nominated by part of the Whig Party for the Presidency in 1836 along with William Henry Harrison , Justice John McClean , and Hugh Lawton White , in a doomed attempt to defeat Andrew Jackson's clever protégée Martin Van Buren by forcing the election into the House of Representatives ( as it had been in 1824 ) . Subsequently , after serving in the U . S . Senate and twice as Secretary of State , Webster died in 1852 . That year , although never renominated by the Whigs , Webster received some electoral votes posthumously in the Presidential election . ) Besides the three good performances of Huston , Arnold , and Craig ( and note too the supporting acting of Qualen , Gene Lockhart , Darwell , and Walter Baldwin , the photography of the film is memorable . See the speed-ed up sequence of the lost souls of the damned visiting the newly opened Stone mansion . It ends with Belle Dee dancing Miser Stevens to death . The music is good too , and the score won an Oscar for Bernard Herrmann , who worked with Welles on CITIZEN KANE and with Hitchcock in the movies of the 1950s . It is a superior morality fantasy film , and makes a comparison between the evil of foreign elements threatening our society in Scratch threatening the good character of the New England men . It is quite good as it is produced , and worth watching and re-watching as an example of first rate movie making .
492627	3280905	43012	10.0	This time Judy doesn't have to borrow a barn to put on a show !	It was her last MGM musical , and one of her best . But she was really troublesome in the making of it , so MGM fired her and her career ( which included at least two more great performances ) never recovered in the movies . That is how SUMMER STOCK is recalled today - the film that wrote " finish " to Judy Garland's film stardom at MGM . But SUMMER STOCK is also the film that gave her her last chance to appear opposite Gene Kelly and to play a story line that she was familiar with . For here Judy returns to the story line of the musicals she made in the early 1940s with Mickey Rooney , regarding " putting on the show " . The difference is that she and Mickey and the others were teenagers ( or supposedly teenagers ) showing up the dubious grown-ups . Here it is grown-ups putting on a show for an out-of-town preview in a small town . Judy is living in a New England town , where her family has old , old roots ( at one point we learn her great great grandfather set up an anti-theater law in 1698 ! ) . She and her sister , Gloria DeHaven , own a farm . Judy has been courted , and is engaged , to Eddie Bracken , the son of the town banker Ray Collins . Bracken is his typical weak type , with eyeglasses and hay fever . Collins is typically fatherly , but a bit of a bully to his son ( not for any bad reasons ) . He looks forward to the marriage as a way of uniting the two oldest families of the area . And he even does Garland a favor , giving her a new tractor for her farm at cost . DeHaven has always been the pampered younger daughter . She has been dating Kelly and invites him and the cast of his musical review production to put it on in the barn of her farm . The musical not only has Kelly as director , producer , and star , but also has Phil Silvers and Carleton Carpenter as his assistants ( in Silvers ' case , supposed assistant as he's a walking disaster area ) , and also been lucky enough to get a famous leading man named Keith ( Hans Conreid , effective in his brief part but all too brief ) . They descend on the farm and Garland and her cook and helper Marjorie Main are uncertain about what exactly to do . Collins and Bracken are not too helpful . In fact their parochial attitude to theater people is very hostile . As the film progresses Garland slowly gets dragged into the production , especially as DeHaven's interest flags . In the meantime the relationship of Bracken and Garland starts cracking seriously as he gets suspicious of the intentions of Kelly towards his intended . The numbers are pretty good , particularly the songs " Howdy Neighbor " , " You Wonderful You " , " Heavenly Music " , and the last minute show stopper , " Get Happy ! " Oddly enough , in the discussions I see on this thread , nobody notes the ridiculous tune that Conreid ( it's not his voice ) and DeHaven sing " Alone on a Lonely Island " . It is done in such a way to spoof the stiff , overly rich voice of Conreid's " Heath " . As it does not show up in the final production it probably was only meant for that character . It is too bad that SUMMER STOCK was her last MGM film . . . but at least Judy left on a high note .
492221	3280905	100211	10.0	A Serious Look at Axis Allies , and a chilling performance by Donald Moffatt	Costa - Gavros has never been afraid to voice his political views , come what may . This includes indicting the U . S . Government in MISSING for collusion in the behavior of the Pinochet regime's killing an American citizen . He also has spoken harshly about Greece's junta in Z and other governments . In MUSIC BOX he looks at the issue of open collaboration in Eastern Europe by right wing governments from 1938 to 1945 with the Axis governments of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . Hitler at his death in April 1945 , and the trial of his leading minions and cut-throats in the immediate post-war years , did a favor of sorts for their allies in Hungary , Roumania , and other Eastern European states ( as well as Western European states ) who gleefully assisted in the Holacaust for their own reasons . Hungary was able to prevent the liquidation of the Jews there until 1944 , due to the reign of the anti-Semitic but careful " Regent " Admiral Horthy . Horthy was unwilling to shed blood , as he was aware that Germany might not win the war and not be able to rubber stamp such a massacre in the future . But in September 1944 Horthy's regime was shattered when S . S . Colonel Otto Skorzeny kidnapped Horthy's son as a bargaining chip . Horthy basically retired from office , and a more pro-Nazi regime came in . It only lasted until the Russians came in the following March , but most of the Hungarian Jewish community ended up in the death camps . Several thousand were rescued thanks to the work of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenburg . Hungary's newly installed Communist Government quickly tried and executed the leading Hungarian fascists ( Horthy was imprisoned until he died ) . The Hungarians had had a pretty sophisticated and successful capitalist society in the inter-war period . They did not take kindly to the Communist regime , and in 1956 they revolted ( see the film THE JOURNEY ) . That revolt was smashed due to western indifference . Hungary did not try it again , but as the decades slid by it practiced more and more capitalism - and closer ties to the west . When the iron curtain finally collapsed , Hungary was very quick to reemerge as a " western " style country ( with the " Czech Republic " ) . But the fall of the Soviet empire also released tons of material for the West to read , not only about Communist collaborators , but also Nazi collaborators . The problem was that the west had to consider if the attacks on " Nazi collaborators " were honest reporting or attempts to smear innocent people . That is the theme of this Costa Gavros film . Jessica Lange is a lawyer , whose beloved father is Armin Mueller - Stahl . He was a refugee from Hungary who came to the United States in the late 1940s , under the wing of Donald Moffat , a Army intelligence officer . Moffat's son married Lange , and they had a child , before the father died . Mueller - Stahl has grown close to the boy , and Lange is happy about this . Then , one day , charges are filed against Mueller - Stahl by the Federal Government's prosecutor ( Frederick Forrest ) that Mueller - Stahl was an active , high ranking Hungarian Fascist who assisted the Nazis in the murder of Hungarian Jews . Lange is angry at this and becomes her father's attorney . Unfortunately as the case progresses , more and more documentation turns up that forces Lange to re-evaluate her father . She fights as long as possible - aided by the questionable people who supply the " proof " . But as it builds , the facade of kindness and love by her father cracks . Mueller - Stahl has repeatedly appeared in films showing a lovely restraint in his acting . Look at his work as the immigrant to America in AVALON . But here he is playing against his normal type - when he finally shows Lange his basic repellent manner and fury he is chilling . He basically tells her to keep her thoughts to herself , or he'll take her kid away from her . But even more chilling is Donald Moffat . He apparently found that saving Mueller - Stahl from a deserved trip to the gallows was quite useful for his own career in military intelligence . He certainly did well in that sphere . But it helps him immensely that he either does not care about the fate of the Jews , or that he openly questions the Holacaust ( in one scene he even tries to start indoctrinating doubt into Lange's son , who is his grandson too ) . That such a character did so well in our country is a bitter pill to swallow , and yet it probably is not far from the truth in many cases .
492783	3280905	27214	10.0	Robinson in " duel " roles	In 1933 Edward G . Robinson had finally essayed a comedy , THE LITTLE GIANT , with passable results . There he tackled the plot of a former racketeer discovering how unworthy the leaders of " good " society could actually be . The same type of a plot would be used again in Robinson's A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER . But in 1935 Robinson was able to tackle a variant on gangster comedy . It was closer to Dr . Jeckyll and Mr . Hyde , as he played good guy wimp Arthur " Jonesy " Jones and public enemy # 1 Killer Mannion . Identical twins , they find they are drawn together by a physical chance . Mannion discovers that Jones looks so like him that he might be able to avoid police surveillance by switching places with Jones ( who , for safety sake , won't try to stop him ) . Jones finds his job at jeopardy , his safety at jeopardy , and his girl friend " Bill " ( Jean Arthur ) possibly at jeopardy . There are some choice moments in the film - Ed Brophy , as the chief witness against Mannion , wandering away to his doom accompanied by " Jonesy " ( or was it " Jonesy " ) , and the antics of two particularly dull comic cops ( James Donlon and - surprisingly bright in the role - Arthur Hohl ) . Robinson as patsy and fiend is equally effective , particularly as Mannion decides the time has come to get rid of his harmless doppelganger and take over his place in the world . But will he succeed . . . or will " Jonesy's " ineptitude and timidity upset his plans . The director of the film was John Ford - it was his first film with either Robinson ( who only showed up again in a supporting part in CHEYENNE AUTUMN ) and his only one with Arthur . As such it reminds us of his film ARROWSMITH , which was his only film with Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes . In both cases he did well with his stars , and one wishes he had tried a second major film with Robinson , Arthur , Colman , and Hayes later on . But at least he did make these two films .
491899	3280905	113862	10.0	A Most Moving Teacher's Film	There are plenty of films about the effect of teacher's over the years on their students . The best known is GOODBYE MR . CHIPS with Robert Donat , but there are others ( GOOD MORNING , MISS DOVE , for example ) . The tragic personal life of the teacher as opposed to his or her dedication to the students is the subject of the drama . Yet the formula works when does well , and MR . HOLLAND'S OPUS was an example of such a successful version . Richard Dreyfus is Glenn Holland , who has been hired in 1965 to teach music appreciation at JOHN F . KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL ( the principal is Olympia Dukakis , and the vice principal is William H . Macy ) . Holland's wife ( Iris - Glenne Headley ) and there child Cole are in a house in the town , and we watch his domestic tragedy - not so much with his wife , but that their son is deaf . Holland concentrates over time on his students , and his constant warfare with the vice principal on matters like rock and roll or the values of music appreciation in learning . Among the students he helps are young athletes trying to accomplish academic achievement , young women trying to break into the field of entertainment or trying to bolster their self-confidence . But he is constantly brought up short by the problems of his relations with his family - especially as his son Cole grows up ( Joseph Anderson - age 15 Cole here ) . Cole is deaf but he is intelligent , and he blows up when Glenn fails to realize that Cole is intelligent about music - a subject he thinks Cole can never share with him . The running thread through all this is that Glenn began the teaching gig as a money maker while he creates his musical masterpiece - a symphony . But both the home life and the school work take up all his time . Yet , as the film ends he realizes that he did leave an imprint on his students , and he did prove a warm and loving husband and father despite real strains due to Cole's condition . The film ends with a proper validation of his full success . Dreyfus was wonderful as Glenn ( ably supported by Headley , Macy , Dukakis , and Jay Thomas as his friend the sports coach ) , and got nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar . While he did not win , his career rejuvenated . And he would eventually try ( with Thomas ) to do a television show in the next decade that dealt with the problems of a teacher in a high school .
492881	3280905	29604	10.0	Before The Women There was Stagedoor	I have always found this wonderful film neglected and I can't understand why . It's director , Gregory La Cava , was highly respected for movies like RUGGLES OF RED GAP and STAGE DOOR in the 1930s , but never got the sort of notice he deserved . Students of film talk of the De Milles and the Wilders and the Lubitschs and the Fords . They may take serious note of Michael Curtiz or Leo McCarey . But La Cava is sort of relegated with Henry Hathaway or George Marshall as well crafting with his material , but nothing outstanding as a type of symbol of their singularity or originality . In fact , many people probably think of La Cava more as one of the intimate friends of W . C . Fields ( like Eddie Sutherland , another director ) than for his films . But in 1937 , two years before George Cukor did an all female cast movie THE WOMEN , La Cava did this film version of the George F . Kaufman and Edna Ferber drama STAGE DOOR . This film does have men in the cast : Samuel Hinds as the wealthy father of Hepburn ; Adolphe Menjou as the stage producer with the moral code of an opportunist ; Jack Carson as a suitor for Lucille Ball and Grady Sutton as a suitor for the servant in the boardinghouse ; Franklin Pangborne as Menjou's too perfect butler , Frank Reicher as the stage director - who finally sees his troublesome star perform the role properly in her own way . But most of the really meaty parts go ( as they should ) to the women in this cast . The women are all the inhabitants of a boardinghouse in Manhattan for aspiring actresses . As the film progresses we concentrate on Ginger Rogers , Katherine Hepburn , Andrea Leeds , Gail Patrick , and Constance Collier . Three others in the supporting cast are notable ( as their subsequent careers showed ) : Lucille Ball , Eve Arden , and Ann Miller . Rogers is interested in advancing her career ( as is Patrick , as is Leeds , and - as we learn - is Hepburn ) . But Rogers is street smart , and initially she sees that her chief rival is her roommate Patrick , who has been romancing Menjou . When Rogers manages to replace Patrick ( momentarily ) she does nicely materially ( as Patrick did ) , but she does not see her career notably advance . She ends the relationship with Menjou by suggesting marriage . Hepburn is determined to show what she can do as an actress ( she's been to college ) . All she succeeds is to get a lead role ( through nothing that she has done - but through outside influences she knows nothing about ) , and her gain is at the expense of the delicate , talented , and ill Leeds . Hepburn does pick up various pointers about acting from coach and supporting actress Constance Collier , but most of the women in the boarding house think the pair of them are snooty phonies . Eventually Hepburn does give the performance of her life - but it takes a tragedy to get her to do it . Up to then her lack of training keeps preventing her from reciting the lines correctly ( to the dismay of the dramatist as well as Frank Reicher the director ) . When she is aware of the tragedy ( an unforgettable moment in the film when it occurs ) , she is transformed into a figure capable of delivering the performance correctly . Hepburn used dialog from a failed Broadway play she did called THE LAKE , and the opening scene is shown in the film . It sounds pretentious , but her " The callalillies are in bloom again . . . . " became part of her legend ( whenever attempts were made to imitate her in cartoons for example ) . All the characters and actresses show their strength in the conclusion , with Collier demonstrating a surprising strength of character to steel up Hepburn's weakened backbone . Rogers vents her spleen to Hepburn , doubly hurtful because she and Hepburn had slowly been working out the problems between them . And so it goes with the rest of the cast . I don't know of too many other ensembles films where everyone had a moment to shine as here ( THE OX-BOW INCIDENT comes close ) . It was a first rate film , and deserves more attention than it has been given over the years by the critics and public .
492000	3280905	31725	10.0	The Problems of Capitalism v . Communism solved by Parisian Champagne	If any film is chosen by most people as the typical Ernst Lubtisch comedy , it is NINOTCHKA . TROUBLE IN PARADISE is usually pointed at as his best comedy , and his best musical comedy is THE MERRY WIDOW with Chevalier and MacDonald , but NINOTCHKA is the elegant comedy of some point that people recall . I think the real reason is that it is , for most people , the best known of Greta Garbo's movies ( after all , she laughed in it ) , and it does dismiss Communism with such sweet aplomb . Actually it does not do so that well . It shows that given an opportunity to relax and speak one's mind , and not worry about informers and gulags , people will be happier . That is true , but one could also say ( as Lubitsch would show in TO BE OR NOT TO BE , that a form of extreme capitalism mixed with racist ideals called Nazism could be just as deadly . Moreover , Leon ( Melvin Douglas ) does read up a bit on Marx and his theories , and has an interesting conversation with his elderly valet ( Richard Carle ) . Douglas feels that Carle has been oppressed over the years as a servant . Carle , though , reminds him that while he does not mind that Douglas has not paid him in quite a while , the thought that in a Communist world he ( Carle ) would have to share his money with Douglas , frightens the hell out of him . Douglas is the lover of Grand Duchess Swanna ( Ina Claire ) whose property was appropriated by the Soviet Government in the Revolution . Her jewelry is now in Paris , in the hands of a trade mission led by Sig Ruman , Felix Bressart , and Alexander Granach . They plan to use it to get needed farm equipment for the Soviet Union . Douglas goes to work to corrupt the three men , which is not too difficult , so he can try to get his hands on the jewels for Swanna . But the Russians send an additional member to head the mission : Garbo as Ninotchka . She is quite hard nosed and business like . Ruman and company try to get her to understand what is going on is a good thing , but she keeps reminding what they are there for . She is not impressed that she is in the " City of Lights " . Instead , on her first afternoon in Paris , she is determined to see the city's power plant ! Douglas sees her and is instantly charmed , but she keeps resisting his efforts . Her background is quite different from what he is used to - we learn , for instance , that she actually distinguished herself in the Russo - Polish war of 1920 - 21 , getting wounded , but killing the Polish soldier who wounded her ( and comforting him as he died ) . She is not without a heart , but she is determined to do her duty . What finally breaks her down is not Douglas ' attempts at romance , but his making a fool of himself trying to tell her a joke . She does break down , but she never loses sight of the reason for her mission . And she and Swanna finally reveal their willingness to sacrifice in a showdown scene , where the Grand Duchess gives up the jewels for Leon , while Ninotchka gives up Leon for the needs of her country . Leon too grows , determined to try to bring her back . The scene between Douglas and George Tobias is one of the funniest in the movie , as Douglas desperately offers to return to Soviet Russia , and Tobias ( knowing what people like Douglas think of the Soviet regime ) refuses to give him a visa ( he might try to blow up a dam ! ) . How he succeeds in the end I will leave to the viewer to find out . My only other comment is that this film is also recalled as the only time Greta Garbo shared a scene with Bela Lugosi , as her supervisor Commissar Razinin . It is only a three minute scene , and has only one funny line for Bela ( describing the antics of Ninotchka's old mission buddies ) . He seemed stern and properly in control of his job , but he was far more funny in INTERNATIONAL HOUSE . Please also note Sig Ruman's comment to Garbo , asking her if she wanted to be alone . It is an interesting little reference to her most famous line of dialog from GRAND HOTEL , six years before .
491617	3280905	79240	10.0	Donald Sutherland's best corpse scene	This is a fun movie , and I recommend it with only two reservations which I'll get back to . Sean Connery rarely is in historic costume films ( the only two that come to my mind was " The Red Tent " and the " Indian Jones " movie that he made , and they are set in fairly modern times - 1928 and the 1930s to be exact ) . He pulls off Edward Pierce with elegant aplomb , a brilliant and inventive gentleman thief who one roots for . Leslie-Anne Down is properly coquettish and sluttish when her goals require it . And Donald Sutherland is properly lovable as a successful pickpocket and thief ( I loved his snapping his knuckles to make his hands more limber ) who allies himself with Connery to carry off the theft . He also makes the most purple faced cholera corpse on film ( you have to be there to understand why ) . The sense of the film setting is good too , from the vintage 1850 train and carriages to the use of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in a scene . The original palace burned down in 1936 , but the model ( although it looks like a model ) is a nice reminder of the time and place . Now my reservations : Michael Crichton's novel was an examination of the hypocrisy of Victorian England . Taking an actual 1855 robbery ( probably the first really great theft committed on a train - of gold bullion needed in for the Crimean War ) , Crichton examined the existence of the very rich and privileged and the very , very poor in the slums . He looked at bordellos that the rich frequented , or the public executions . Much of this is in the film . Downs repelling the advances of the fat bank official in the train is an example , as is the public execution of a poisoner - the chant the " good people " yell as the woman is hanged , " Oh my , I think I have to die " is an actual chant used by the public at those occasions . But Crichton also notes the irony of the way the public attack the train thieves while embracing the idiots running the Crimean War that the gold was for . In the novel Pierce brings up the murderous James Brudenell in court . He refers to Lord Cardigan , the fool who led the Charge of the Light Brigade . The court rebukes Pierce . That is not in the movie . Secondly , in reality Pierce was more villainous than the film ( and Connery ) makes him . We do see Connery's character strangle Willie , the human fly who he used to steal one of the keys he needs . But Willie had " peached " on Connery and the gang to the police . In the actual case Pierce had cheated several of the others in the division of the spoils . He was better covered when the prison sentences were handed out ( because he planned the crime , and the others performed it ) . The judge in the case , angry at how Pierce behaved , sentenced his one or two year sentence to solitary confinement - which is very hard on most prisoners . And he served the sentence - he did not escape the police as the film has it . Despite those reservations this is still a grand film to watch .
492478	3280905	36135	10.0	He Whips To Glory !	James Mason ( like Richard Burton , Edward Arnold , and many other splendid actors - and actresses ) never received the Oscar for any of his performances . This is one of the unfair side issues regarding the Academy Awards , as a measuring stick to film stardom . Everyone who has seen Mason's performances ( and the others I mentioned ) may know they are appearing in a " turkey " , but they are serving their sections of the " turkey " with deluxe dressing . When they are appearing in " filet mignon " or the like , they really reach the heights . So , despite his lack of Academy recognition , Mason is remembered with great fondness by everyone who enjoys movies . To this day his voice is imitated in cartoons if you want to see a snooty , aristocratic villain . Yet I said " villain " . How can I call the wounded , deserted IRA gunman Johnny ( ODD MAN OUT ) or Norman Main ( A STAR IS BORN ) or Humbert Humbert ( LOLITA ) a " villain " . Yes , he did play Mr . Van Dam in NORTH BY NORTHWEST , but even that fellow had his less villainous moments ( too few perhaps ) . The fact is , when Mason came to the U . S . to appear in Hollywood films in the late 1940s , it was as one of Britain's best villains . This was odd . He had been in films since the late 1930s , and had played a shell shock victim in THE HILL HAVE EYES as well as other parts . In FIRE OVER ENGLAND ( an early role ) he was an English Catholic nobleman who is planning to aid King Philip of Spain ( for reasons of politics and religious freedom ) but who is drowned fleeing the police of Elizabeth I . None of these performances had gained him his fame , deserved as it was . It was THE MAN IN GRAY that gained him fame . Set in Regency England ( c . 1790 - 1837 ) , Mason was what was termed " a Regency Buck " . This was a fashionable , upper crust Regency aristocrat or wealthy man who enjoyed his privileges - frequently at the expense of everyone else around them . When Leslie Howard played Sir Percy Blakeney in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL , his character is a foppish version of " the Regency Buck " , acting the buffoon at the expense of Col Higgensbottom and even the Prince of Wales - regarding cravats - to hide his serious mission ) . Mason's character is actually a more openly forceful version of this character . The Marquis of Rohan is a great grandee of England ( despite having the last name of a noted French Aristocratic house - connected to the " Affair of the Diamond Necklace " ) . He is fully aware of his position , and the subservient position of everyone else involved with it . Phyllis Calvert is Clarissa , the daughter of a local good family , who was a close friend of Margaret Lockwood ( Hester ) . Their relations is similar to that of Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp in VANITY FAIR , as good girl and bad girl . Rohan chooses to marry Clarissa because she is a proper ( and subservient ) wife to breed an heir . Clarissa tries to help Hester by getting her a good position in the household ( bad mistake ) . Rohan is soon bored by marriage , and Clarissa mistakes this as a signal that she is on her own . She meets a traveling actor named Rokeby ( Stewart Granger ) and starts a relationship with him - egged on by Hester . Hester intention is to reveal it at the right time to Rohan , and replace the disgraced Clarissa . And she does . But it actually does two things . He does go after Rokeby to kill him . But after taking care of that problem , Rohan finds Clarissa going into physical decline . And his better character comes out . He tries to help his wife , but nothing he does helps . . . and she finally dies . The Marquis is heartbroken . SPOILER COMING UP : Hester still blind to the reality of the situation , confronts Rohan , and reveals her own passions . But now Rohan is fully aware of why Hester made her revelations , and what it has led to . Furious at being used , and at his own cost and of the woman he got to love , Rohan grabs a horse whip and whips Hester to death ! It is an orchestrated , violent conclusion ( and it's violence may be why the film is rarely shown on television ) . Despite making Rohan a killer at the end , because he is killing the real villain in the plot Rohan gets the audience to cheer him on ! He becomes the " anti-hero " of the story . It gained Mason his international standing as " a man you love to hate " . And it opened the doors to future Hollywood stardom .
493240	3280905	44876	10.0	The Threat of Sidney Stratton ?	THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT , like I'M ALL RIGHT JACK , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an . . . err . . . accident in a college laboratory ) . He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . When the film begins he is in Michael Gough's company , and Gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law ( Cecil Parker ) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs . While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter ( Joan Greenwood ) , Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems . He reads the huge expenditures ( due to Guinness's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee . Guinness goes on to work at Parker's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too . Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on , and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . The result : Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . Any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever . Guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich . But when he explains to them what he's done , they turn against him . If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! Soon Parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by Gough , Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and Howard Marion-Crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . They seek to suppress the invention . With only Greenwood in his corner ( although Parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public . In the end , Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all . It's a brilliant comedy . But is the argument for suppression valid ? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? What happened to fashion changes and new styles ? And the cloth is only made in the color white ( making Guinness look like a white knight ) . We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . Wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? Alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . As such it is brilliant . But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness ' invention
492789	3280905	529640	10.0	What is the value of winning any contest if you go too far ?	This was a nice episode of BONANZA which was a balance between comedy and serious ethical problems . A bunch of Virginia City businessmen ( led by Edward Andrews ) decide to hold a contest for the most beautiful baby in town . Naturally every mother with a baby enters the contest . The judges include Hoss ( Dan Blocker ) and soon he and the others find a second contest going on , as the women try to use any trick or advantage they have with the judges to win for their baby . Hoss is trying to keep an open mind on the contestants ( and try to help keep his fellow judges in line ) when he zeros in on the one woman in the group that has little to use as a key to winning the contest except for the beautiful baby she has . Unfortunately there is also a well-to-do woman who is pulling out all stops : not only bribes mind you , but economic threats to the judges and the group who set up the contest . SPOILER COMING UP : Hoss sees he cannot fight the actions of this wealthy from allowing her to buy the prize . But at the conclusion of the episode the woman discovers three points that Hoss mentions to her . First all the other mothers know she bought the prize ( or extorted it ) as do the businessmen , the judges , and the townspeople . Second after getting the ribbon for the prize , she goes to show it to the others , and everyone is concentrating on their own babies , and if not they are shunning her because they don't like her . Finally , Hoss points out that her baby is going to grow up having it thrown in his face that his mother did not think the baby could win on his own beauty but had to have her buy the vote for him . The baby won't forgive her either . It was a rather nice example of how this series sometimes took the wispiest of material and made a good episode out of it .
492877	3280905	536361	10.0	Now a trifle more bittersweet than expected	In 1962 the subject matter of this episode was funny . It still is , but there is a sense of sadness - only one year later the episode would never have been aired . . . or even written . The plot of this episode was that the Police Department has chosen Captain Block's Precinct for a special detail . President John Kennedy is coming to New York City , and needs two police officers to accompany his car ( as drivers and guards ) . So the officers chosen are Gunther Toody ( Joe E . Ross ) and Francis Muldoon ( Fred Gwynne ) . Block ( Paul Reed ) is not really happy at the selection , but he calls in the two to inform them , and then finds the real flaw of the selection . Muldoon is rendered weak - kneed by the prospect of being in charge of the President's safety . He has long been a fan and admirer of Kennedy , and he can't imagine having his hero's life in his hands . Block and Toody try to calm him down , and he does make an effort . And all this is happening before the arrival of the one person who can put the kibosh on the entire assignment : Simon Oakland . Oakland was a favorite character actor of mine . Usually playing villains or negative types ( like his police lieutenant in WEST SIDE STORY ) he did have a gift for comedy . In particular his recurring role as the harried editor to Darren McGavin on KOLCHAK : THE NIGHT STALKER , he tried to control what he thought was his ace reporter's flights of fancy as best he could - and to little avail . He has the same approach here . His Secret Service man , Mr . Cordner , is all business , and serious . Yet he can't understand why Muldoon is acting so nervous . Muldoon is not apparently happy about driving Kennedy . He is really reluctant to do so . At one point , he even asks if Muldoon likes the President . And Toody is not helping his friend and partner - he tries to reduce the entire issue by dismissing the importance of their would-be passenger . " The President ! The President ! " , he says to an astounded Cordner , " You make it sound so important ! " They pass the first session with Cordner barely . Then they try relieving Muldoon of his anxiety by using tranquilizers . Naturally too many of these are popped by Muldoon . . . with interesting results . It actually is a funny episode to the conclusion . But given the events of November 22 , 1963 . . . it's a little odd to see it now .
491811	3280905	42546	10.0	The Pooka and the Dipsomaniac	The role of Elwood P . Dowd was played by Frank Fay on Broadway and in London - and to universal acclaim . Fay ( who had alcohol problems of his own ) could bring that aspect to the role ( Stewart brushes it when he goes to Mr . Cracker's bar ) , but Fay also showed ( from some of the descriptions I have read ) a muscularity of mind that Stewart does not quite show . Fay's Elwood has wondered about the phenomenon of his invisible / invincible friend , and while he accepts it he truly is in awe of the phenomenon . But Stewart has grown to just enjoy his friend's remarkable powers . He accepts them , and never tries to fathom them . As the play continues we see how the harmless Elwood and Harvey distress so many people . His sister Veta and niece Myrtle Mae blame them for isolating them from their social register friends . Judge Gaffney sympathizes with Veta , and her determination to put Elwood into an asylum . Dr . Sanderson and Nurse Kelly see Elwood as a potential patient , as does the dismissive Dr . Chumley . And Wilson has the most experienced ( and realistic ) view of insanity of anyone - he doesn't trust the inmates ( more of that later ) . The thing that is amazing in HARVEY is that everyone ends up accepting the Pooka - and in the case of Dr . Chumley actively seeking to take Elwood's place . It's because of their disillusionment with the society that they try to placate . Myrtle Mae and Wilson both think Elwood is a nut , but they find they like each other . They both are on different levels of the social scale , but both are lonely , and they click ( much to the dismay of Veta , who was briefly manhandled by Wilson as an asylum guard ) . Gaffney is supportive of Veta's actions towards Elwood ( although he always liked Elwood ) because he is in love with Veta . But he gets fed up because of Veta's own unwillingness to remain consistent about what to do with Elwood . Sanderson and Kelly get their wires crossed , and Sanderson actually thinks Veta is the mentally ill person ( and it is sometimes feasible to believe it ) . It leads to Chumley briefly firing his assistant , and in the temporary disaster Kelly and Sanderson revealing their deeper feelings about each other . Soon they are just as willing to listen to Elwood's philosophy of life as they are in locating him for giving him the medication that may cure him - but turn him ( in the words of the taxi driver ) into just another stinker like the rest of us . Chumley is more interesting . He later admits that Harvey is so remarkable that everything that science has discovered is child's play compared to him . He does end up wanting to replace Elwood in Harvey's affections , but it is only for a temporary loan so that he can have an emotional release in some motel in Akron , Ohio with a simple , sympathetic woman and some beer . It's as though the society that has honored him actually chokes Chumley - his dream is a general rejection of respectability for two weeks only , as it is impossible to imagine he can get away with much more . As he is married it is very probable that the two weeks would be about all his need for release and freedom can guarantee him . The people who do accept Elwood and Harvey are not people with responsibility or position . Mr . Cracker and his customers ( except one wise guy at the start of the film ) see nothing odd at Elwood having an invisible friend . The taxi driver likes people like Elwood - they appreciate the trip to the asylum , and his driving . Mr . Schimmelplusser ( Clem Bevans ) is usually ignored by the Chumley's of the world who employ him , but he is very proud of the electronic fence and likes Elwood's notice of it . Elwood and Harvey have the support of the little people . As Elwood explains it , he could have been successful or pleasant , and he chose to be pleasant . Most people do want to be pleasant . HARVEY is one of the world's best fantasy plays , and it's success far transcended what was expected in the late 1940s when Mary Chase wrote it . Tragically , the reality of mental illness does not always allow for Elwood's " pleasant " disposition . Wilson actually has the most realistic moment in the play when he explains to Sanderson and Kelly that he has seen the insane close up - that frequently they are all sweetness until they know that they are not being observed , and then they do really life threatening damage to you . He actually happens to be correct . Although his reactions throughout the play are meant as comic blunderings or such ( witness the marvelous moment when he reads the dictionary definition of " Pooka " ) , he does show one moment that ( to me ) makes his roughness understandable and even heroic : when Dr . Chumley has disappeared after going off with Elwood , Wilson suddenly shows deep concern for the poor doctor , imagining him lying insensible in a pool of blood . It doesn't happen , but in reality it could happen very easily in the real world . The entire cast , especially Stewart and Josephine Hutchinson ( Best Supporting Oscar ) were wonderful , but at that moment Jesse White was superb .
491895	3280905	829182	10.0	A Warm Short Film About Religious Fervor and Acceptance	The Turner Classic Movie Channel occasionally has " A festival of shorts " , and I watched some of them tonight . The first one was this film starring Edmund Gwenn , Lumsdale Hare , and Hans Conried . Set in the Middle Ages , Gwenn is a struggling street performer - a juggler . He is trying to get to Italy before the winter snows stuff up the passes of the Alps - there are street fairs in Italy that he can make a living at . But he is ill , and collapses in the snow outside a monastery . The Abbott ( Hare ) brings him in , and nurses him back to health - despite the snobby suspicions of Conried ( he notices that the gold and silver monastic treasures are in a cabinet in the room next to that Gwenn is in , and starts closing the locked cabinet very openly in front of Gwenn ) . Hare , a kindly man , more than makes up for Conried's negative vibes , but he is willing to dismiss Gwenn's efforts to show his religiosity . Gwenn has no normal method of work or ability to use to show his fervor or devotion . But it saddens him when his juggling tools are belittled ( tactfully as it is done ) by Hare - but at the conclusion of the short Gwenn demonstrates that one can win divine acceptance of one's love of God by any means that comes from the heart . This is a very sweet short religious film .
