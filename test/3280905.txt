493207	3280905	46248	1.0	When the Medveds Are Right . . . .	I hesitate to give this a " 1 " for awful , but it is - by all memories of all the bad films I ever saw - the worst I ever saw . The Medved Brothers , back in the 1980s , listed " Robot Monster " among the 50 worst films of all time . It deserves that accolade . With dialog ( serious dialog ) like " I am not a human . . . I am a Ro - Man . " said by an actor in a gorilla suit ( George Barrows , the actor in the gorilla suit , actually played a gorilla in another film in a few years - it must have been one of his so-called talents ) , this is the nadir ( I almost said Nader , for the star of the film ) of bad movie making . It is poverty-row movie making . I notice the name of Ed Wood mentioned in some of the reviews here . Wood never did a good film , but there was ( I believe ) a man in Wood who really felt he had some type of cinematic vision . It was not a trained one - it was quite inept . But if you look at what Wood is attempting to do in some of his films in the 1950s ( tackle cross-dressing in " Glen Or Glenda " , for example ) one can vaguely sympathize with his having some concepts but no talent to really put them across . I think that is why Wood has somehow become a negative Hollywood legend . That can't be said for Phil Tucker . He never seems to have gotten the bug of making just monster movies . When Wood planned " Plan Nine From Outer Space " , he did intend to comment about the danger of our arms race ( it comes out ludicrously in the film , but it is there ) . Tucker could not do that . He just could push together the typical hack like conventions to muddle through . So he has the heroine " vamp " the " Robot Monster " no matter how idiotic it looks . I have never seen Tucker's " Cape Canaveral Monster " , which was his last film , but I suspect it is just a slightly smoother version of the bilge he put together here . I do have one suspicion that makes me think this film was just a poverty row quickie without rhyme or reason ( not like Wood's type of schlock which he actually agonized over at home and when filming ) . I noticed while looking through the credits the backgrounds and fates of the different players . The only one who went anywhere in the 1950s was George Nader , who actually may have done a good performance in one film ( " Away All Boats " ) , but whose career petered out due to his getting involved in a homosexual scandal . He ended doing television in Germany . This film actually was his first real " lead " role . Barrows never had as " important " a role in a film as " Robot Monster " . Selena Royle had done some important films in the 1940s but she was blacklisted ( possibly unfairly ) . She did make a successful second career in Mexico ( which I am glad about ) . John Brown was also a victim of the blacklist . Few know of it today ( despite the decades of reruns of the old Burns and Allen television show ) but he was on the show for a few months in 1950 , replacing Hal March as the neighbor Harry Morgan . Brown , who had a distinguished career in radio comedy shows like " The Life Of Riley " , was replaced by producer George Burns when his sponsor pointed out that Brown was suspected of communist sympathies . He would be replaced by Fred Clark . It is the shows with Clark and later Larry Keating that we have seen to this day . Brown kept working when he could . He died in 1957 . Claudia Barrett's career died out in the 1960s . As for the two child performers , Gregory Moffett acted until about 1956 , and Pamela Paulson never made another film in her life . John Mylong usually played bit-parts in films , frequently ( during World War II ) as Nazis ( he's in " The Hitler Gang " ) . He does play Eddie Duchin's ( Tyrone Power's ) father in " The Eddie Duchin Story " . In short this cast is strictly from hunger in terms of name recognition . All , that is , except the future acting " success " Nader , and the past success Royle , and this is a rung up for the former and a last chance for the latter . When Tucker cast this picture he grabbed people who were desperate to be in anything that offered them a chance to have a speaking part of any type , no matter how silly . Now compare this with Woods - he uses Bela Lugosi again and again , because he recognizes that Lugosi has name recognition with the public , and some degree of talent left as well ( though drug addiction made the latter even weaker than it was ) . He also uses some character actors like Lyle Talbot who have been around for awhile ( the Medveds don't think highly of Talbot , as he seems somewhat humorless - actually at about the same time he worked for Wood , Talbot appeared as himself in a comic series of rivalry confrontations with Bob Cummings on the latter's successful television series " Love That Bob ! " ) . Wood also used local television stars like Vampira and Cresswell the mentalist , and Tor Johnson the Swedish wrestler in his films . In short Wood looks like he made an effort to choose his cast with something approaching thought ( for effect , for what he thought was talent ) . The results might have been laughable , but it showed a type of care . Tucker didn't show that . So for all the cheesiness of Wood's works , we can admire the attempt . We can't with Tucker . The most memorable moment of this movie ? The booming voice deciding to unleash prehistoric monsters on the planet ( we see some kind of lizard roaming a small set - it's supposed to be a tyrannosaur ? ) . I think it was memorable because it came about two minutes before the film ended . It still came two minutes too late .
492076	3280905	53214	4.0	Seen once , and memorable for one scene only	Clifton Webb was always a difficult person to cast - in the 1940s and 1950s they just did not make movies where he would have fit perfectly : films where his character was openly gay . There are elements in his films ( especially in LAURA and THE DARK CORNER and THE RAZOR'S EDGE ) that suggest a high strung , waspy , near - homosexual type . So does his Mr . Belvedere . But throughout the 1950s his films concentrated on him as a father ( frequently with large families ) and a husband - even ( in DREAMBOAT ) a sexy movie idol of the silent period ! This film is of those " family oriented " comedies that Webb made in the 1950s . As pointed out , it was based on a Broadway comedy , and it probably was purchased with Webb in mind . With his ability to personify intellectual types , he fits the free-thinking Horace Pennypacker . The Pennypacker family was actually quite distinguished in 19th Century Pennsylvania . One of them , General Galusha Pennypacker was a American Civil War hero , and Samuel Pennypacker was Governor of Pennsylvania from 1903 to 1907 . As to an actual historical figure named Horace Pennypacker I cannot say ( although one of the reviews on this thread suggest there may have been some reality about the situation regarding the bigamy . However , the play turned film was dull . Webb tried to be funny ( even skating at one point ) , but the dialog really was not very good . The best moment in the film is between Richard Deacon ( a member of an organization like The Society to Suppress Vice or something like that ) and Charles Coburn . Deacon has found that Pennypacker has been passing around ( presumably freely ) a booklet of a mildly risqu√© nature concerning biology . It has flip pictures ( you flip the pictures and they look like they move ) . Unfortunately Deacon has never had Horace Pennypacker pointed out to him . So when he sees Charles Coburn leaving his grandson's ( Webb's ) home , he concludes that Coburn is Horace Pennypacker . He confronts Coburn , and asks , " Are you Mr . Pennypacker ? " " Yes " , says the mildly annoyed Coburn . " Of Pennypacker & Co . ? " , asks Deacon . " Yes , yes . . . what do you want with me ? ! " , shouts Coburn . " THIS ! " , says a triumphant Deacon - he flips the pages of the book in front of Coburn's face . " BaH ! ! " , shouts Coburn , who knocks the book out of Deacon's hands . " You assaulted me . . . yes you did ! ! " , says Deacon and he signals a waiting policeman who drags a protesting Coburn away ( he later apparently straightens out the mistake , for he shows up to confront Webb before the end of the film ) . It was a mildly amusing moment in the film - and the best one , unfortunately . One has to admit that THE REMARKABLE MR . PENNYPACKER was one of the weaker features that Clifton Webb made in Hollywood .
493443	3280905	660820	5.0	Twentieth Century Disasters meet a " Flying Dutchman "	A bit of background is needed here . In the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic , some of those who were in the water , but were pulled up into the lifeboats , still died as a result of exposure . The most notable victim among these was John Philips , one of the two brave wireless men - the other was Harold Bride - who kept sending distress messages for the two and a half hours the Titanic was sinking : Philips died just before the Carpathia arrived . The Carpathia and other rescue ships had to spend some time picking up hundreds of corpses . Not all of the 1500 odd victims were found - many floated away hundreds of miles until their bodies sank . But a little over two hundred were actually retrieved and buried on land ( mostly in Halifax , Canada ) . In the shifting of the bodies from the actually living survivors , four dead bodies were left in a rubber collapsible boat . A few weeks after they were left , the boat was found again by one of the other " rescue vessels " , and rather than return these decaying corpses , they were wrapped up and tied to the collapsible , and the collapsible allowed to be deflated and sunk into the Atlantic . It is believed that this particular story is the basis for the " NIGHT GALLERY " episode known as LONE SURVIVOR , although an older sea legend is connected , as well as the tale of the man who fled the Titanic and was supposedly wearing a dress or a woman's shawl ( most likely candidate for that was a steerage passenger named Patrick Buckley , who was wearing a shawl ) . The episode on " NIGHT GALLERY " dealt with a lifeboat of the Titanic found floating in the North Atlantic ( more precisely , floating off the coast of southern Ireland near the Old Head of Kinsale ) on May 7 , 1915 . There is a dazed man in it , and he is alive . How has he been able to survive for three years ? The episode was not the best written - except for occasional segments of the new series , Sterling's crisp writing from THE TWILIGHT ZONE was not as obvious in his second , lesser series . The Captain of the ship ( Torin Thatcher ) and the ship's doctor ( Hedley Mattingly ) try to deal with this strange survivor ( John Colicos ) only to find that he is as dazed about why he has been at sea for three years as they are . He can recall the night to remember , but he needs awhile to remember the details . Eventually he realizes that he is the Flying Dutchman - he is a specter who is doomed ( as punishment for fleeing the Titanic in the place of a woman ) to be at sea , saved from one doomed ship to go to another doomed ship forever . He tells Mattingly to warn Thatcher that the Lusitania will be torpedoed that day off Ireland . Mattingly does tell a dismissive Thatcher , but then Thatcher notices that Mattingly and the other crew and passengers seemed to have disappeared . A moment later we see the wake of torpedo and hear the explosion . The last moments of the episode ( of course ) shows that some forty one year , in July 1956 , off Nantucket , Massachusetts , a lifeboat from the Lusitania is spotted with one survivor in it - and picked up by the crew of the Andrea Doria . If one figured out the timing of the years between Titanic and the second disaster , it was pretty easy to figure out what unnamed ship picked up the lone survivor in the Titanic lifeboat . Oddly enough they jumped to the next famous luxury liner disaster - they could have chosen ( instead ) to pick , say , the " Vestris " or the " Morro Castle " or the " Dara " from that forty year period . If the acting was sufficiently good to keep one watching , the story was not compelling enough to merit the retelling . One interesting feature regarding one of the performers . Hedley Mattingley was in many television shows , most notably in DAKTARI with Marshall Thompson in the middle 1960s . His appearance here is a decent performance ( complete with beard ) but nothing special there . What is special is a little ironic . If you check his thread on this board , Mattingley was born on May 7 , 1915 ! He came in just as the Lusitania left the scene .
492585	3280905	19702	5.0	" The British Museum Had Lost It's Charm . . . . "	Like so many of his films , because Alfred Hitchcock became such a great director his name became a hallmark for suspense . To attach his name with any project gives that project a " leg up " . This happens with many major directors : Capra , Welles , Huston . . . the list is simply endless . Their fans think they can do no wrong , even if the film isn't that good . BLACKMAIL was Hitchcock's last silent movie , and first sound film . It was also one of the first two sound films in British motion pictures . So it is historically significant - a milestone film everyone is aware of , but one few necessarily watch . He does ( in my view ) one really good sequence in it : the robbery and chase in the British Museum . Fortunately this is in the conclusion of the film , and it does help the movie that it is at the end ( it raises the excitement of what really is a dull movie ) . But that said , the defects of the film's plot , and the transition to sound planning , stand out . Noteworthy too , by the way , is that it is the second most famous titled work that Cyril Richard showed up in that has survived . Here we see the young Cyril as an artist , a lady's man ( which is surprising ) , a would-be rapist , and a corpse to push the plot along . Not quite the same thing as his dashing and vigorous " Captain Hook " in the television version of PETER PAN , but sometimes artists can't pick and choose what they will be memorable for . If you are interested , while looking over his movie / television credits , I noted the next interesting movie he did pop up in was THE WINSLOW BOY ( 1949 ) in an extra role . His best grown-up role on stage , as " Sir Sir " in THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT THE SMELL OF THE CROWD , unfortunately was never filmed or taped ( but there is a record of his and Anthony Newley's singing ) . As is pointed out Donald Calthrop gave the best performance , as the blackmailer , of the three leads . The hero and heroine are somewhat colorless in comparison to Calthrop and Richard . The plot too is somewhat stupid ( as also was pointed out ) because Anya Ondra could have defied the blackmailer by showing she was attacked and defended herself ( as again was pointed out ) . The behavior of her boyfriend ( John Longden ) , however , is less defensible . Policeman are not supposed to tamper with evidence . However , her relationship with Longden points the way to Sylvia Sidney's with John Loder in SABOTAGE , and Theresa Wright's with MacDonald Carey's in SHADOW OF A DOUBT , and Cary Grant's with Eva Marie Saint's in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ( among other Hitchcock films - and better ones ) . Hitchcock apparently re-shot the whole film with sound ( and secretly ) because of an order from the studio to only do the last reel in sound . He felt it was silly and so secretly re-shot it all in sound . BAD IDEA ALF . The problem with a last minute change like that ( as Hitchcock would have soon realized , but never admitted ) is that you need a full script with complete dialog to carry off something like a total film in sound . If one watches BLACKMAIL , for two thirds of it the " sound " is quite limited to very occasional talking . There are huge periods when people aimlessly move about without saying anything . It's very annoying after awhile : Are we to see this as a silent movie ( where this would work ) ? Well , turn off the sound ! But what are they saying ? Well then , put on the sound but give them something worthwhile to hear and without long , pointless gaps ! Hitch tried to bridge the two , and flopped . His fans admire his being the first , and this being his first " talkie " . Well and good , but it does not begin to compare with the films he began to make from 1934 - 1939 in England , and the films he made in Hollywood .
492520	3280905	48087	5.0	It should have been better	This film should have been better somehow . It has a lot going for it , in terms of the cast ( with Stewart Granger and then wife Jean Simmons cast in roles which generate friction , not love ) . This is like the negative to their relationship in YOUNG BESS . In that story the plot of Admiral Thomas Seymour to grab control of England's throne through forcibly marrying Princess Elizabeth was twisted into a romantic tragedy ( the first of many for the " Virgin Queen " ) . But the story held one's interest , and the script was well written ( in particular giving that rising talent Deborah Kerr her first pathetic victim part as Katherine Parr Tudor Seymour ) . This is set in Victorian times , and is based on a story by W . W . Jacobs . Don't confuse him with his rival late Victorian / Edwardian / Georgian short story writer H . H . Munro . The latter , ever recalled by the nickname " Saki " is remembered for his impudent and brilliantly sardonic stories of life in the early 20th Century in Europe , like " Tobermory " and " Shredni Vasthar " and " The Interlopers " . Jacobs was always W . W . Jacobs , and is principally recalled for one masterpiece of suggestive horror : " The Monkey's Paw " . If one looks at his spot on the IMDb board , many films ( mostly forgotten ) were based on his short stories ( mostly forgotten ) . One that did get made was based on " The Money Box " , and was turned into Laurel & Hardy's comedy about two sets of twins , OUR RELATIONS . And there was this film . If it is not as good as a film with Granger and Simmons as YOUNG BESS , it is not as good a movie based on a tale by Jacobs as OUR RELATIONS . Briefly it is the story of two connivers who's goals run into each other . Granger is seen at the beginning returning from the cemetery , having buried his wife . Only when we are alone do we realize that far from mourning the loss he is very satisfied . Naturally this raises suspicions in our minds - and in the mind of an ambitious maid in the house played by Simmons . She finds proof that the wife did not die naturally , but was poisoned . She proceeds to force Granger to marry her . This was not in his scheme of things , and so he decides that Simmons must go . But in their scheming and counter-scheming others get hurt , and suspicions begin to recirculate concerning both of them . The story's resolution resembles an Eric Portman film of a few years before ( not based on the Jacob story ) called DEAR MURDERER . Oddly enough , that film was a better movie about an ill-mated pair of vipers . Whether the flaw here was that the script seemed to drift along , or the directing was not as crisp as it should be is hard to tell . For the sake of the cast , starting with it's two leads , I have given it a five . However , DEAR MURDERER would have gotten an eight .
492366	3280905	41604	5.0	The tepid end of a great comedy team	Because I like the Marx Brothers I am willing to give this film a 5 . If it had starred Wheeler and Woolsey or the Ritz Brothers , I might have given it a 2 . After ROOM SERVICE , only A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA had any real merit among the final Marx Brother films . In the case of these two films , the former was based on a successful Broadway farce ( which is still produced occasionally ) , and the latter had some planning involved in it as well ( a novelization of the complete screenplay - certain parts were edited out of the final film - was published ) . The other four are mediocre at best . And LOVE HAPPY is the weakest . Yeah , Harpo gets some nice moments , like him riding the neon lit " Pegasus " on a rooftop sign . He and Chico have one or two good sequences together ( one of those patented " Chico - verbally - interpreting - Harpo's - mimed - message " sequences is good ) . Chico also has a wonderful moment when he tries to be romantic to Ilona Massey , promising to cover her in sardines . But these are so few and far between that the weaknesses in the film are shown . Yeah , Groucho is an afterthought . He has that one famous moment with Marilyn Monroe , but that's it . It looks like much of Groucho's material ended up on a cutting room floor . His " Watson " figure is Eric Blore ( an interesting combination of comic talents there ) , but Blore too is only briefly seen . One wishes to know what more there was to that sequence . But even if we discount shortchanging Groucho , what is left is nothing to shout about . It is a disappointing film , especially as it was the last real Marx Brother feature film . The following movie the brothers were all in was THE STORY OF MANKIND , and each was in a separate segment . There were three television shows they were in together ( though one was with other Hollywood comics like Ernie Kovacs ) , but none of these had the strengths of their best nine movies .
492496	3280905	53109	5.0	The Peculiar Problem of James Cagney's Musicals	In a wonderful movie career - arguably the best ever for a male leading man - Jimmy Cagney made seven musical films . Of these , only two are great musicals . The first was Busby Berkeley's FOOTLIGHT PARADE ( 1933 ) wherein Cagney is the harried producer of mini-musicals that are used to introduce films in movie houses . The conclusion of the film , wherein he ( in tales ) is a drunken sailor in the Far East , " lookin ' for my Shanghai Lil " ( Ruby Keeler in heavy make-up ) is one of the best Berkeley production numbers . Nine years later he became the first actor to win an Oscar for best actor in a musical portraying George M . Cohan in Michael Curtiz's great YANKEE DOODLE DANDY . Those two films document his real greatness as a song and dance man . Some of the gangster films also suggest the dancing ability . Years ago Mikhail Baryshnikov was interviewed on a program about Cagney and pinpointed how in THE PUBLIC ENEMY , when he has killed several enemies in a shoot out , but got badly wounded himself , he walks away wounded in a kind of twisted dance step that illustrates his determination to get away , and shows his agony at the same time . It's a good thing that those aspects are on film , because his other musicals leave much to be desired . In his memoirs , CAGNEY , he admits liking SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT because a dance number enabled him to dance with two hoofers he had long admired . But the whole movie is cheaply made ( he was fighting Warners in a contract dispute at the time ) . There were two films with Doris Day : THE WEST POINT STORY and LOVE OR LEAVE ME . The latter is a wonderful movie biography of singer Ruth Etting and her hellish marriage to gangster Marty " the Gimp " Snyder , and both stars gave first rate performances . But Day is the singer and dancer in the film ( Cagney's character's crippled condition makes any dancing impossible , and his personality was not conducive to singing - though he really admires Ruth / Doris's voice ) . THE WEST POINT STORY has several lively numbers in it , including Cagney in a zoot suit singing about his beloved Brooklyn ( as well as later singing about " the kissing rock " ) . But the music is not the greatest music ( although the film is entertaining enough ) . In THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS he reprises Cohan for a dinner at the Friar's Club , and a song and dance with Bob Hope ( as Eddie Foy Sr . ) on the dinner table . It's a good number - but only that single scene . Similarly there is a single sequence in THE MAN WITH A THOUSAND FACES , where we see Cagney as Lon Chaney Sr . in vaudeville doing a silent comic bit as a hobo , and ending in a lively dance . Again though , it is only that one scene . Then there is this film : NEVER STEAL ANYTHING SMALL . It would be the last musical he would ever appear in , but it's value is far below that of FOOTLIGHT PARADE and YANKEE DOODLE DANDY . The film is also lesser than THE WEST POINT STORY , THE MAN WITH A THOUSAND FACES , or LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME - it may be as good as SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT . Based on THE DEVIL'S HORNPIPE , a musical by Maxwell Anderson , the plot is interesting . Cagney is playing McIllaney , a crooked labor union leader trying to become the head of the longshoreman's local . His plans are totally unscrupulous , and are complicated by his falling for Shirley Jones , the wife of ultra-scrupulous lawyer Roger Smith , whom Cagney tries to frame so he can marry Jones . He also uses his normal girl friend Winnipeg ( Cara Williams ) to lure Smith away from Jones . At the conclusion , despite some set-backs , the ever conniving Cagney still looks like a formidable future union leader . The film sounds promising , but it is not memorable as a script or as a source of music . GIRL CRAZY , the Gershwin musical that was filmed with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland had a silly plot about a spoiled young man who is sent to a small town agricultural college as punishment . But the films music soared - including standards like " But Not For Me " . That is not the case here . The most memorable tune in this is a number concerning Cagney winning over a reluctant Williams to become a siren and break up Smith's marriage to Jones . They are discussing this on a street , when they pass a car showroom , and Williams ' eyes light up - she does want a Ferrari . So they break into a ditty called , " I'm Sorry , I Want a Ferrari " . Cagney is properly horrified ( his idea of a proper bribe would have been say $500 to $1 , 000 . 00 - not $25 , 000 . 00 ( 1950 money ) ) . In the course of the tune , Cagney even suggests that where he comes from Ferrari is considered a " very bad word . " They end in a type of dance step on an conveyor line . And ( apparently ) Cagney is going to have to cough up the Ferrari . I describe this because that is the film's highlight . Perhaps it is his star magnetism at work - he is a terrific performer and screen presence ( which is why I'm giving the film a 5 ) . Williams is good too in the number ( her enthusiasm for the Italian car almost like she is thinking about good sex ) . But aside from that scene the movie is forgettable - totally wasting Jones ( a terrific musical singer herself ) and Smith for that matter . There must have been a curse active - he hit the heights of musical success twice , and touched it a bit three or four times , but just could not duplicate those two great successes . A real pity that .
492300	3280905	27657	5.0	An unsexy Marlene can be dull - and a Selznick misfire in color	He's not recalled today like his two contemporaries Somerset Maugham or James Hilton . He is Robert Hitchens , and in his time ( roughly from 1900 to 1947 or so ) his books were frequently best sellers . Only one is recalled today - and it is not THE GARDEN OF ALLAH . His fictionalization of Oscar Wilde's career - THE GREEN CARNATION - is still republished occasionally . But SNAKEBITE , AFTER THE TRIAL , BELLA DONNA , and THE PARADINE CASE are rarely read ( all four were made into films , and the last was a failed Hitchcock movie ) . He did have his own share of controversy . In 1923 the prosecution and Judge in the notorious British homicide trial of Edith Thompson and Frederick Byswater noted the imaginative Mrs . Thompson liked to discuss the books she read and mentioned Hitchens . Mr . Justice Shearman said Hitchens wrote filthy books . Coming from such a source that actually is a complement . Hitchens liked the desert as a setting of his tales . BELLA DONNA was set in Egypt in part , dealing with an archaeologist . So his novels are pretty much time capsules to us , reminding us of earlier viewpoints about the globe and what to find there . Today when we think of the world of North Africa and the Islamic countries I suspect we think of xenophobic anti-Western , anti-American , and anti-Jewish peoples , or of suicide bombers , or of fanatics . Of course this is a gross simplification of the mass of these people . But similarly stereotypes ruled the view of Islamic lands in the 19th and early 20th Century . On the one hand was a look at the beauties of the desert and a sense of it's timelessness and it's mysticism . This was mingled with a view that Islam was a kind of poor cousin ( for want of a better term ) to Christianity , worshiping God but being somewhat more superstitious ( although in fiction the superstition was usually correct in the ironies of the story ) . But on the other hand North Africa and the Middle East were seen as hot and sexy uninhibited areas . In novels like Andre Gide's THE IMMORALIST you went to North Africa to escape the hypocrisy of European society ( similarly , Evelyn Waugh would send Sebastian to North Africa in BRIDESHEAD REVISITED to drink himself to death with his lover ) . Keeping all this in mind helps understand the misfire called THE GARDEN OF ALLAH . David Selznick produced it to use the new Technicolor style of film - and to give the film it's due Richard Boleslawski's movie is a beautiful one to look at . Further , he brought in Marlene Dietrich ( who had already done a " desert " romance with Joseph Von Sternberg in 1930 - MOROCCO ) , Charles Boyer , Basil Rathbone , Joseph Schildkraut , C . Audrey Smith , Alan Marshall , and John Carridine for his cast . With all their hard work , though , and the beauty of the film itself , it remains a failure . The problem is the hokeyness of the story to us today . Hitchens sets up the lovers ( Dietrich and Boyer - their only film together , by the way ) on parallel courses . She was brought up in a Catholic school run by nuns in France , and her father ( a rich man ) has died leaving her his fortune . She has had a secluded life so far in the convent and caring for her father , and she yearns to see the world and find love . Boyer has been a Trappist monk , who earns the money for his monastery by being the sole possessor of the recipe for the manufacture of the monastery's liqueur . But at the start of the film he has fled the monastery and is traveling on the same train as she is . They both leave at a city thirty miles south of the monastery . At a fight in a nightspot both are at , Boyer rescues Dietrich . Soon they are seen together pretty frequently , and fall in love . He tries to leave but can't . Instead he proposes marriage and she accepts . The local priest ( Aubrey Smith ) does not know why but can't trust Boyer . A premonition by a seer ( Carridine ) that is told to Dietrich and Rathbone makes the latter equally wary about the marriage . But Dietrich is all for it . They go on their honeymoon ( accompanied by their servants including Schildkraut ) . The keep staying in the desert apparently content , until the accidental arrival of Marshall begins undoing the entire situation : Marshall ( a French army officer ) met Boyer at the monastery , and knows his story . SPOILER AHEAD : When the matter reaches a boil , Dietrich and Boyer reluctantly return things to normal . . . or as near normal as possible . They tearfully part as Boyer returns to the Trappist life , and Dietrich hopes that in a better world they will be united forever . Somehow today we wouldn't swallow this too thoroughly . The monk might decide to drop his duty to the God he swore allegiance to because he does want to be a regular man . The woman who needs love would likewise urge him to do so , and the hell with the world . Instead we have this 1936 solution - and while the actors make the best of their talents bringing it to a boil it sits badly . Also , Marlene is a woman of vast sex appeal . While Selznick dressed her quite well here ( and the color helped too ) , she does nothing sexy in the film . Dancer Tilly Losch is sexier . Joan Fontaine would have been better in the part ( ten years later ) . For all the passions of the story , her performance is dull - and the movie hard to accept .
492311	3280905	51003	5.0	An Interesting Failure	This film should have been made by William Wellman or John Ford . Both of them made films about flight - Wellman made LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE among others , and FORD did THE WINGS OF EAGLES . Though Ford's first love was the sea ( and he was a master of westerns and films on Irish themes ) , he had a grasp about excitement generated by flying . These were the sort of men who could have tackled this story . Or if not them , Howard Hawks , who did such a great job with ONLY ANGELS HACE WINGS . But , instead , Billy Wilder directed THE SPIRIT OF ST . LOUIS . How he got that assignment I cannot guess . Wilder was best at films that spoofed or studied our national foibles . Our propensity for litigation got the once over in THE FORTUNE COOKIE . The work ethic and corporate promotions are looked at ( acidically ) in THE APARTMENT . The Roaring ' 20s are spoofed in SOME LIKE IT HOT . Male preoccupations with sex get the once over in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH . The tendency of news media to push tragedy over information is at the center of ACE IN THE HOLE / THE BIG CARNIVAL . While the bulk of his films ( at least up to 1966 ) were successful , Wilder's film list includes several clinkers . After THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR , THE LOST WEEKEND , and DOUBLE INDEMNITY , Wilder did the half successful , half odd THE EMPEROR'S WALTZ . It was a good film , but somehow it seemed at times to get lost - like when three minor characters do an impromptu dance number two thirds of the way through . His record of successful films in the early 1960s ended with KISS ME STUPID , which suffered from a casting change that Wilder could not control ( Peter Sellers had a near-fatal heart attack , and was replaced by Ray Walston ) . And in the 1950s Wilder did this film version of the Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography THE SPIRIT OF ST . LOUIS by Charles Lindbergh . And he turned out a well made film , but one that remains the most boring film in his career . It think part of the problem is that everyone who sees the film knows that " Lucky Lindy " is going to make it to Paris . Except for the first flight of the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk , the one fact of flying that everyone recalls is that Lindbergh did make the first non-stop , solo flight from New York to Paris in May 1927 . There is no real tension built up , even though we are aware that Lindbergh faced very real dangers . He had to completely fill up enough gasoline to get him across the Atlantic - which meant that he had no room for safety devices in case of emergency . He had little chance of survival in the middle of the ocean ( which we are reminded about in the film's references to Charles Nungesser and his partner Raymond Coli , who disappeared on route from Paris to New York two weeks before Lindbergh took off ) . These dangers would grip us if it was a fictional story , so that we do not know the conclusion . Once you know he got to his goal , you don't care about these " apparent " threats . It is also static for nearly twenty minutes of the film - representing the three day flight by having Jimmy Stewart as Lindbergh making comments to himself while flying or looking out of the window . With little real action and a lot of talk , the film becomes progressively stiff and dead , so that many people don't stay around for the conclusion ( the arrival of the plane at Orly Airport in Paris ) . While there are some nice moments in the film , most viewers probably turn it off before it is over . For the sake of Billy Wilder , James Stewart , and even Charles Lindbergh , this film gets a " 5 " for being a nice try .
492028	3280905	507782	5.0	A Below Par Episode For This Series	I have usually said that the best episodes of ONE STEP BEYOND were able to hold the attention of the viewer even if the viewer was skeptical about the subject matter . This particular episode actually was below average - the subject matter did not live up to the build up , despite the tragedy at the conclusion . Alex Peters ( Frank Maxwell ) has a crippled daughter named Carolyn , and is concerned when he realizes he hasn't long to live . He tries to set up a trust fund for the daughter , but lacks the funds . So , in desperation he decides he has to rob the bank . George Chambers ( Ralph Nelson ) is married to Ellen ( Roberta Haynes ) . George and Ellen live quite well . He has a job at the bank . Then Ellen gives him some news she forgot to tell him that there is going to be a bank examiner coming in a few days . George collapses in fear - it seems he has been living better than he should on his salary because he is embezzling money . So George runs to the bank to repair the books as best as he can . So two lines of fate are drawn to that branch of the bank . George gets there first , and starts repairing the books as best as he can . But then Alex shows up and holds up the bank . Of course , by doing that Alex is making George's attempts at repair less and less plausible : once the robbery occurs a full audit will be needed to see what was stolen , and the defalcation will really be glaring . So George tries to stop the robbery . Alex shoots and kills George , but this enables a guard to shoot and kill Alex . Here's the weakness though . Newland's epilogue asks why did the forces of the universe cause two men to end each other's lives . But that's just it - they didn't end each other's lives . There was no mutual killing here . George was not armed - he was shot by Alex . But another person shot Alex . Unless that third person's story was as twisted as these two you can't make a case of the forces of the universe causing mutual destruction .
492853	3280905	87980	6.0	Bill's first move towards the serious .	Bill Murray had been one of the bright stars of the original Saturday NIGHT LIVE . He had a good transition into films in films like STRIPES . But in 1984 he felt he had to show his growth as a performer . He left comedies and moved into straight drama . For some reason he chose to remake Somerset Maugham's novel-into-movie THE RAZOR'S EDGE . The results were not bad , but they were not as good as later dramatic films that Murray made in the 1990s and 2000s . The best thing I found about this version of THE RAZOR'S EDGE ( which I saw in a movie house in Flushing in 1984 ) was the opening . Somehow in the 1946 film version , the horrors of the western front were not as well developed in the final movie ( a distinct weakness , by the way ) . Larry Darell ( Murray in this version and Tyrone Power in the 1946 version ) is , like Ernest Hemingway , an ambulance driver . In Murray's film he is taken under the wing of a cynical ambulance driver who explains how to view things when the pressure of enemy bombing or shelling gets to you . After all , you have to drive to the front lines , pick up the wounded and dying , and bring them back to the hospitals behind the lines . You can get killed in a barrage . The cynical driver , when he witnesses the death of some other ambulance trainees , starts giving a speech of how much he disliked them , and how he won't miss them . His eyes and face show he is lying , and is saying this for his mental health . Subsequently the cynical driver and his assistant are killed . Murray , who has grasped this lesson , repeats the same speech regarding the cynical driver that the latter had given earlier . This was a key scene in the story - it explains how Larry is shattered by the horrors of the war . And it sets the stage ( better , actually ) for his search for answers in the Far East than Tyrone Power had demonstrated in the earlier version . That was the best difference between the two films . Otherwise , the Murray film lacked the cast strengths of the Power film . Besides Power , Clifton Webb , Gene Tierney , Anne Baxter ( " Oscar " winner here ) , John Payne , Herbert Marshall and Elsa Lanchester added cast strength there . But here the best performer was Murray , and only Denholm Elliott as Elliott Templeton really was good , and he was pale compared to the great Webb in the same role ( although he was able to give an unbowdlerized version of Elliott's final line of dialog ) . This is a fair film version , but the original is better .
492543	3280905	108715	6.0	Nice Try For a Revival , but not quite good enough	The original BURKE'S LAW from the 1960s was , in it's day , as much a popular detective series with " style " as THE AVENGERS were . That does not mean it was as well written as the best AVENGERS episodes were . The best BURKE'S LAW episodes concentrated on the mystery plotting rather than the social satire of Steed and Ms Peel . But the central idea , about a millionaire Police Chief in L . A . was picked up and reused within a decade in MACMILLAN AND WIFE with Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James . The use of dozens of Hollywood movie figures as suspects in the plots of the BURKE'S LAW episodes would become a model for such later shows as COLUMBO and MURDER SHE WROTE . To keep up with changes in the audience ( in the wake of the James Bond phenomenon ) , the network changed the original to a spy series starring Gene Barry again as Amos Burke , but that turned out to be a flop . So it left the screen . Barry would soon return to television with Robert Stack and Tony Franciosa in THE NAME OF THE GAME , so his career continued to flourish . Than , in 1994 , BURKE'S LAW returned for a new season . The only difference was that Amos was now a widower with a grown son named Peter , played by Peter Barton . The basic character of the Chief of Police was kept by Barry , who mingled brains , elegance , and a sly wit ( culminating in his " interpretations " or " popularizations " of rules of law ) when explaining some situation confronting his solving a case with his son's assistance . Again there were many familiar faces , but now many were from the first two generations of television ( understandably , as the old Hollywood faces who appeared in the 1960s were dead or dying our ) . In one episode , a Judge who realizes the short-comings of the criminal justice system ( with a degree of humor ) was played by Sherman Helmsley of THE JEFFERSONS . But what showed the limitations of the revival was only apparent to people who watched the original . They were reusing old screenplays and story lines . For example : One episode dealt with a famous magician who was performing a Houdini like escape by being sealed in a coffin , and sunk into a pool for twenty four hours . The coffin is brought to the surface , but the hotel doctor notices something odd when the coffin is opened . He goes over to the magician and examines him - and announces the magician has died , but from being shot . As the pool had underwater cameras trained on it , nobody can figure out how the magician got murdered . Now this happened to be a very fine episode on the original series . The hotel doctor in that episode was Paul Lynde , who naturally played the part for every drop of humor that could be squeezed ( he keeps moping about the fact that he has just started working at this luxury hotel , and his bosses will not like that his first claim to public attention was this garish murder case ) . The actor playing the magician was not a well known one . But when it was remade in 1994 , the magician was played by John Astin , and instead of only appearing at the very start of the episode only , Astin made a surprise second appearance in the later part of the episode as a kind of visual trick . The hotel doctor was played by Tom Bosley , but with more seriousness than Lynde showed in the original . Other actors ( including Roddy MacDowell ) popped up in the episode as rival magicians who may have killed Astin . The solution , however , remained the same as in the original version . Another episode was a repeat of the story that was in the original series where Anne Francis popped up as female detective Honey West . Francis's West would go on to have her own series on television for a year or two as a result of the appearance in the first series . Of course the scripts had to be rewritten to give Peter Burke as much to do as his father Amos . But the fact that the episodes became retreads of originals showed that the series had not been well thought out after all . For old time fans it must have seemed a let-down to see the old tales repeated ( especially as you could guess the solutions ) . For new audiences , there was the problem of attracting new fans with characters they could get involved in . Barry and Barton tried , but the father and son team did not work very well . It was entertaining enough , but not as memorable as the original had been .
493190	3280905	95252	6.0	This Film Is Also In Honor of those Escapees . . . And the Commandant of the Camp	I am noting that of the previous comments of this film two of them are rather picky about the factuality of the aftermath story of the Great Escape . There have been times that I have been picky like that too , but I also note that the very fact that a film is made to show what happened after is a triumph for at least partially telling the full story . This film begins when the escapees are beginning to be rounded up and brought back to prison camp ( or . . . as we later learn . . . exterminated ) . One of them is in a prison for interrogation near Berlin . One night he goes to his cell door because he hears another prisoner's door being opened for interrogation purposes . He looks out the window of the door and sees Colonel Von Lindiener ( Manfred Andrae ) the commandant at the stalag the escape occurred at being hustled out . He has obviously been worked over pretty fiercely . Subsequently it is learned that the Colonel was executed for failing to prevent the escape . Now Von Lindiener was not an idiot like Werner Klemperer's " Col . Wilhelm Klink " in HOGAN'S HEROES , nor an easy-going man , but he had been running the camp to the best of his ability as per orders . Unfortunately ( as the first film showed ) there were prisoners in the camp who had escaped other camps before and were expert in various specialties needed to properly aid in an escape . He did his best , but was outmaneuvered by them . A demotion in rank might have been proper punishment for the man , but when you have a bunch of opportunists , criminals , and fanatics running a government under a racist madman you can't count on normal behavior or balance regarding punishments . The Commandant was as much a victim of the backlash as those escapees who were unlucky enough to be captured by the Gestapo . The film follows how the surviving officers who led the escape start learning of the massacres of their comrades . An American officer , played by Judd Hirsch , is put in charge of the investigation aided by Christopher Reeve as Major Dodge . Slowly ( with the assistance of Anthony Dennison as Lieutenant Corery and Charles Haid as Sergeant MacKenzie ) the actual fates of the dead escapees , and the identities of their killers come out . And the killers rounded up for trial and punishment . But as they get closer and closer to the ringleader of the assassins Hirch , Reeve , and Company find not only a ruthless , unrepentant adversary , but evidence of a still in place Nazi underground . Now how much of this is true I can't say . Certainly the criticism of the failure of the film to note a large scale British trial of the murderers is noted . However the film on its own merits was quite good , and deserving of being shown again . Best performance in it ( I thought ) was Hirsch , though Reeve did well in support . I noticed that the one man the British condemned to death was reprieved . I would not be too harsh on the British for that . After World War II there was an American trial dealing with the massacre of captured Americans during the Battle of the Bulge by SS troops . The " Malmady " Masacre trial similarly ended with a death penalty for the leader and several others . However there were voices against it - the Junior Senator from Wisconsin , Senator Joseph McCarthy ( for whatever reason - the heavy German voting population in that state may have been one ) arguing that the SS troops were ordered to shoot prisoners . It's doubtful that McCarthy's worthless grandstanding did anything but annoy the Truman Administration , but new political realities dictated leniency . The death sentences were reduced to relatively light prison sentences . However , the head of the death squad , in the 1970s , was shot to death fleeing from his burning cabin . Sometimes justice is slow but complete .
491828	3280905	25740	6.0	Sadie and her men	A Joan Crawford vehicle ( prior to 1940 , when she got more control over choosing her properties ) tended to have her the center of attention of several men at once . In THE GORGEOUS HUSSEY she is of interest to Melvin Douglas , Jimmy Steward , Robert Taylor , and Franchot Tone ( she ends with Tone , but Taylor apparently married her for awhile ) . Here her beaus are Tone again , Gene Raymond ( who in a poignant moment sings " ALL I DO IS DREAM OF YOU " across the footlights of a packed theater to Crawford ) , and Edward Arnold . But while Peggy O'Neill in THE GORGEOUS HUSSEY is genuinely attracted to her beaus , Sadie Magee really only is interested in Tone and Raymond . Tone is jealous of her interest in Raymond , and Raymond throws her over for Esther Ralston . But she meets Arnold , a nice guy millionaire ( who is the son of a cook , like Crawford is the daughter of a cook ) , and she agrees to marry him for security . The problem is he's an alcoholic ( and while normally a decent sort , he can be violent - he socks her at least once ) . However , she is decent too , and finally ( despite the well-meant but stupid behavior of his butler , Leo G . Carroll ) helps cure him . All in time to return to a dying Raymond . All in time to end up with Tone again . This is a very kitschy vehicle . But it is well acted and directed , and worth seeing .
493006	3280905	53044	6.0	The Colonial Problem of Great Britain In The 1950s	CARLETON-BROWNE OF THE F . O . used to appear with some regularity in the New York metropolitan television area of the 1960s , but it was called " THE MAN IN THE COCKED HAT " . This was not unusual . The comedy " THE NAKED TRUTH " was called " YOUR PAST IS SHOWING " . I saw it twice back then , and remember a few points that have been downplayed in these reviews . SPOILERS AHEADIt was not as serious a film as it seems to be to some of the reviewers . Rather it touched on the serious because it dealt with the end of Britain's empire and the way the cold world politics of the U . S . and the U . S . S . R . got entwined everywhere . What was being shown in the satire was that Britain ( in the personality of it's man on the spot , Carleton-Browne ( Terry-Thomas ) ) was too civilized to handle the realities of the dark politics of the era ( keep in mind the film is British , so it is not really looking closely at the view of British policies and actions from the point of third world countries ) . The irony of the film is that those civilizing traits happens to be the unifying point that brings an end to the civil war bloodshed that is smashing the island kingdom of Gaillardia apart . After showing how behind the times the foreign office of Raymond Huntley and Terry-Thomas is , we are taken to Gaillardia . A play is being attended by the King and his oldest son and heir , both of whom are bored by it . One of them says something like , " I'm blow-ed if I stay here " . At that a bomb explodes killing them ( paging Alistair Sim in THE GREEN MAN ) . The younger son , Ian Bannen , returns to the island , only to find that his uncle ( John Le Messurier in an unusually ruthless and power-hungry role ) is there to tell him it would be wisest if he would abdicate now . Bannen , who has been living in England , is trying to make his country a successful constitutional monarchy like mother England . He calls in the British Foreign Office , as his local " support " is the corrupt Prime Minister ( Peter Sellers ) . The Foreign Office sends Terry-Thomas . He has no idea of what to do . The island is slowly splitting in half , due to the activities of Le Messurier and his candidate for the throne , a Princess of the house . Le Messurier does not know that the Princess ( Luciana Palluzzi ) has met the young Bannen when they both were returning home ( both had been in England ) . Actually she is just as set to set up the constitutional monarchy as Bannen is ( and as Le Messurier is not , nor - for that matter - as Sellers could care for ) . Unless you keep that in mind the plot of this seems aimless . Carleton-Browne ( in his fumbling ) comes up with a solution . It resembles the shamble solutions of East and West Germany ( until 1989 ) , Cypress ( until today ) , North and South Vietnam ( until 1975 ) , and North and South Korea . He sets up a dividing line for Gaillardia so that both parties will be satisfied . It is voted on by the U . N . Security Council without any problem . Then it turns out that the aggression that Le Messurier brought to the matter was due to the U . S . S . R . It seems that the Northern part of the island has a valuable mineral the Russians need . When Carleton-Browne tries to undo the agreement , because he had not known this , Russia says he can't . The British have been patrolling the demilitarized border area . Suddenly open civil war breaks out . Le Messurier thinks it is his opportunity , only to find his niece has a mind of her own , and it has no place for him as an adviser . Similarly ( earlier ) Bannen overhears Sellers offer to put the young king out of the way if Le Messurier will agree that he continue as Prime Minister of the reunited country . Bannen and Palluzzi both disappear , rendering their " pupper masters " useless . They only reappear when they confront Carleton-Browne - together they have formed a majority counter-insurgency to overthrow Le Messurier and Sellers . They are uniting to save the country . They do . Basically what happens at the end is that Bannen and Palluzzi will marry and bring a constitutional country ( based on Britain ) to the island . Le Messurier ( stunned and sad faced ) is going to retire to some hotel in Europe where ex-monarchs congregate at . He will be accompanied by Sellers . The comedy is in the film , but it is not consistent because of the commentary on modern diplomacy . Russia gets slapped for supporting dubious regimes ( it's supporting a monarchy here , of all things ) for raw materials . The U . S . is not directly affected ( it is Britain that is ) , so when a sequence of news headlines from Britain show what a disaster is about to happen , the American newspapers reflect some trivial items of passing interest . In the last sequence , symbolically , the U . S . and U . S . S . R . have sent teams to play a soccer match in front of the Gaillardians . Carleton-Browne , despite his naivety and bungling , has won a victory for British civility ( if not for the empire ) . He kicks the first soccer ball , as Sellers looks with patient interest , and an explosion occurs ( paging again , Alistair Sim ) . But a final newspaper headline mentions he is being awarded a knighthood for his wonderful success as a diplomat , while he recovers .
492787	3280905	47191	6.0	The Best Known of the Lucy - Desi films	Mildly amusing , THE LONG , LONG TRAILER is the film with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that most people recall if they think of the films they did together . That is not because their films were remarkable ( they are entertaining to an extent ) but because they only made three films together ( TOO MANY GIRLS , FOREVER DARLING , THE LONG , LONG TRAILER ) . The best one is TOO MANY GIRLS , which actually was made when the two met on the set of the film . It happens to have a nice cast ( including Eddie Bracken , Anne Miller , and Francis Langford ) , and even a score by Rodgers and Hart . But it is not one of the all time great musicals . FOREVER DARLING co-starred them with James Mason ( that is a casting match almost on level with Bob Hope and Katherine Hepburn in THE IRON PETTICOAT ) . Then came THE LONG , LONG TRAILER , which has some interesting supporting cast ( Keenan Wynn , Marjorie Main , Howard McNear ) and an interesting director ( Vincent Minneli ) . The second and third film could only be made because of the deserved success of the television show I LOVE LUCY , but in reality they aren't that much . Still THE LONG , LONG TRAILER is of interest as one of the few films ever to discuss the phenomenon of trailers in changing American living and vacationing ideas . Trailers actually appeared in films prior to the 1950s . The Laurel and Hardy short , THEM THAR HILLS , showed the boys taking a " restful " vacation using a trailer to go to the mountains . That was in 1938 . But it was rarely shown because it was such a specialized way of travel , and dependent on good roads . But the 1950s saw one achievement that was due to the Eisenhower Administration that is frequently overlooked . Ike pushed for the real development of an interstate highway system . It was a major change to the American scene . Not only in the pushing of many middle class families in using trailers for vacations across the nation , but also in convincing people to travel even by car across state boarders . It is no accident that in the early 1960s one of the most popular television series was ROUTE 66 , wherein two young men traveled across the whole nation on that particular highway having adventures in many states . The Eisenhower years were also the years of economic recovery - the Second World War had pushed American industry into full throttle , and most other major countries had serious economic problems due to the war . The improved American economy gave us a chance to spend more . Although Desi looks worried when he purchases the new trailer ( especially as he also has to modify his car's rear bumper ) he still is able to sign a large check for the down payment of the vehicle . He could not have done that in the 1930s or 1940s . The plot is how Lucy ( who wants to travel ) convinces Desi to buy the trailer , and how the optimism of the purchase ( based on the ideal dream of seeing the world from your moving house ) hides the fact that you are driving a vehicle that is as difficult to maneuver on land as a yacht is at sea . From the start when Desi is shown the proper way to move the car and trailer ( " Trailer , Brake , Forward " ) he is constantly aware that he is pulling a dead weight behind him . A weight made even heavier because Lucy insists on a new hobby ( collecting rocks from every site they park their new home ) . There are problems with pulling it into the driveway of Lucy's aunt's house , or of stopping at a red light ( and by not doing it properly , annoying traffic police officer Keenan Wynn ) . There is also the problem of water supply and the pipes ( when Desi tries to take a shower ) , and even of cooking when the trailer is in motion ( my favorite section of the film : Desi singing contentedly while driving , thinking of the fine meal Lucy is supposed to be cooking him , and then discovering at the conclusion that Lucy is covered in food and flour due to bumps and jumps made by the car and trailer while moving ) . At the conclusion he has had enough , and his explosion threatens to destroy the marriage . If it was not that Vincent Minelli's name is on this film one would be hard pressed to see his traces here . Some of his artistic taste is evident in the design of the trailer , and the colors in the film , but the material is not the sort he normally dealt with . He could do comedy ( witness THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE ) but his characters usually have meatier stories to tell . This is not one of them . Still for a pleasant viewing it is easy to watch and smile at . But if you want to see Lucy and Desi at their best , stick to their classic comedy show .
492158	3280905	514521	6.0	A Problem About British Humor .	This episode of the popular British comedy series illustrates a real problem regarding English ( and I suspect European and Foreign humor ) that Americans have been trying to deal with here since the age of Lenny Bruce . Although humor deals with discomforting images of people , humiliated or momentarily hurt in some manner ( deserved or not ) , there has also always been elements of bigotry or bias to different groups in humor . It the humor is self-deprecating ( a Jewish comedian talking about himself and his fellow Jews , like Jackie Mason , or an African-American talking about African-Americans , like Redd Foxx ) the audience does not care because we are laughing with the party . But when a Caucasian makes remarks about other groups , we start thinking differently about it ( unless , like Don Rickels , he or she attacks all the groups including his or her own ) . We call it " political correctness " for better or worse . Other countries in the west struggle with it , but I suspect the U . S . ( with it's really polyglot population ) deals with it more frequently . The issue is should we do this , or should we just enjoy the joke ? The British are slowly getting it into their heads that with increased foreign ( i . e . , non-White ) peoples being third or fourth generation English , they have to clean up their act too . But there are vestiges that are visible from a few decades ago that surprise and baffle us , and probably ( when they appeared ) did not bother the British public for the most part . This was the " Christmas Episode " for 1981 of ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? , which usually had a number of musical sequences for the regulars . Here they are having a 90th Birthday party of old Mr . Grace ( Kenneth Waller ) and even bring back his predecessor and younger brother young Mr . Grace ( Harold Bennett ) . In 1981 the success of the television program ROOTS from the U . S . was an international phenomenon . That series , you recall , was Alex Hailey's attempt to trace his ancestry in the U . S . back to Kunte Kinte , the African who came to the U . S . as a slave in the 18th Century , through other figures in the 19th and 20th Centuries like Chicken George . It is a phenomenon still affecting us - just look at the number of genealogical sites on the internet some forty years after that show . Keeping this in mind , the episode followed how the staff of Rumbolt's floor are assigned to do genealogical research into the Grace family , and to present a pageant of that research with a song from the part of England the Grace's originated from . Well , the Graces are first shown as Scotsmen , then Yorkshiremen , then Welsh , with slight changes in their name . SPOILER COMING UP : Then we are told they are further south in origin than that . To the tune of " Waitin ' For the Robert E . Lee " we see the cast come out in top hats , tales , and black-face ( yes , black-face ) for the finale . Now the effect , to me , is mixed . A similar kind of joke on a " Benny Hill " show ( where Hill , back in the late 1970s , was playing the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin ) also has that on me . Hill was in a military tunic and wore black face . He behaved . . . well as nutty as Benny Hill usually did . But the black face got me , as did a joke on the tyrant's name ( the tyrant's desk had two " in " and " out " mail boxes , labeled " Amin " and " Amout " ) . But Hill's hit and run comedy , if here unsettling , could quickly pass to the next matter . Not so with the finale of ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? for everything in the episode led to that conclusion ( which made a referenced pun of the title of the episode " Roots ? " ) . While as well produced and performed as any other , the conclusion is out of kilter with what we currently expect - or what American audiences would have expected even in 1981 ! So I give it a " 6 " out of " 10 " . . . and it is a rather weak " 6 " at that ! !
492074	3280905	25314	6.0	Weak Arliss feature , but it has one interesting moment	Of the various Arliss biographies , THE IRON DUKE is the weakest one . It is about Arthur Wellesley , the Duke of Wellington , who is recalled for his excellent handling of the British troops in Portugal and Spain against the French in what is called " The Peninsula War " ( 1809 - 1813 ) , his leading the allied forces in finally defeating Napoleon I in the battle of Waterloo ( June 1815 ) , and his post-war political career , culminating in his three year Premiership of England ( 1828 - 1830 ) . His main accomplishment as Prime Minister was to get Catholic Emancipation granted in Parliament . Problem ( as pointed to on another comment here ) is that Wellington was in his late 40s and early 50s in the period this film deals with ( 1814 - 1816 ) . Arliss is far too old for the role . He is also too short ( C . Aubrey Smith who played the role opposite Arliss in HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD was closer in age to the role , and physically closer ) . Christopher Plummer's Wellington in WATERLOO is also closer to the Iron Duke , in age and physical condition . The story deals with what Wellington did to stop Napoleon and in the immediate period after . He was appointed to be British ambassador to France , and to advise the French government of Talleyrand and the Bourbons ( under King Louis XVIII , oldest surviving brother of Louis XVI ) on setting up their restored monarchy . In truth , King Louis and Talleyrand did not need much help from Wellington , but in one area they made a critical decision that almost sank the regime . This was the " Ney Affair " . When Napoleon returned from the Isle of Elba in March 1815 , he quickly regained thousands of followers throughout France . Most of the old military leadership did not return to Napoleon's standard , because King Louis was smart enough to offer an olive branch to them , and incorporate them into his court . One who got a high military post was Marshall Michel Ney . Ney was Napoleon's most popular general , known as the " Bravest of the Brave " . He decided to return to Napoleon's side . He fought under Napoleon in the last campaign , and was one of the defeated at Waterloo ( leading the last charge against the British ) . Ney was arrested by order of King Louis . In 1816 he would be tried for treason , and ( after a trial ) convicted and shot . The French public was very angry about this decision , and it did hurt the Bourbon restoration . However , King Louis was smart enough to weather the storm . In 1824 the King died , and his brother became King Charles X . Unfortunately Louis ' abilities at weathering political storms was not shared by Charles , who would be toppled in 1830 by his cousin , Louis Phillippe of Orleans . The film suggests that Wellington was opposed to the judicial killing of Ney , because he respected the bravery of his old opponent , and he saw the vicious action behind it due to the Duchess d'Angouleme ( Louis ' niece , and the only surviving child of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette ) . In fact , Wellington did not get involved ( he really did not have any legal standing to get involved , even as a friendly observer / adviser to King Louis ) . But this is the plot of the film . The cast , aside from Arliss , is mediocre , except the Duchesse is played by Dame Gladys Cooper - who certainly shows a fanatical vicious streak towards any " revolutionary " heroes . But in one scene , one appreciates what Arliss accomplished as an actor . Arliss believed in a natural , slightly hesitant style of acting that rarely became bombastic . If he had to display anger , he could do so by raising his voice normally . But he did not like the outlandish over-theatricality of Victorian and Edwardian acting that was the norm in it's day . At one point , the actor playing King Louis ( Alan Aynsworth ) is scared by the overly hostile reaction of the French people to the execution of Ney . Arliss is at the court , lecturing them on the blunder they have committed . He is speaking sternly , but normally . But Aynsworth is chewing the scenery in despair at the blunder ! If you see the film watch Arliss's eyes looking at Aynsworth . He is really angry at this overacting ham . It is a moment of revelation at how George Arliss did know what good acting and what bad acting really was . It is also the most interesting moment of this weakest of his biographical films .
492864	3280905	25501	6.0	A Mighty Thud - Paging Burt Lancaster and Beau Bridges	Warner Beery made one really good film biography in his career : VIVA VILLA . If it did not catch the truth of the story of Francisco Pancho " Villa , it came close to giving a fascinating view of the personality that to many Americans remains ( with his associate Zapata ) the key figure of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 - 1921 . But it was not his only biographical film . The film that followed VIVA VILLA was THE MIGHTY BARNUM , which emphasized Beery's comic abilities . It was not as good a movie . Beery was at the height of his Hollywood stardom ( he was not the regular comic lug yet , except in some of the films with Marie Dresser ) . In 1930 he did arguably his best film performance as Butch , the gangster in THE BIG HOUSE who keeps pining over his unseen girlfriend . In 1931 he shared ( with Fredric March ) the best actor Oscar for his performance in THE CHAMP . In 1933 he would be Dan Packer , the wealthy scoundrel with political ambitions and a troublesome toy wife ( Jean Harlow ) in DINNER AT EIGHT . In 1934 , besides VIVA VILLA he did his best co-starring film with Jackie Cooper , TREASURE ISLAND . And in 1935 he and Harlow were reunited with Clark Gable and Rosalind Russell in CHINA SEAS . Artistically Beery was at his peak . THE MIGHTY BARNUM demonstrates that a great performer or star does not have to be in a slump to make a turkey , but can make one in the midst of a trove of great performances . It is not that Beery does not try to give a good performance as the great 19th Century impresario , museum owner , super humbug ( but lovable one ) , and circus magnate . It is just that he's saddled with such a weak script that he does not know what to make of his role . Occasionally he seems a visionary about the entertainment world ( which old P . T . really was - he thoroughly understood glitz and advertising was a key to success , long before his rivals did ) . But Barnum was ( on the whole ) a shrewd , skillful businessman . He was tricked badly once in a swindle involving a clock company that was failing - it led to his temporary bankruptcy . But most of the time he and his shows ( and his skillful , entertaining tricks ) made a great deal of money . Beery's Barnum will push certain people or exhibits for what they are worth , but he keeps coming a-cropper regarding properly developing them . The script writers were doing this on purpose . They wanted to spring a last minute surprise on the audience concerning Barnum's friend and adviser , Mr . Walsh ( Adolphe Menjou ) . Menjou always suggests the smart thing to do to push the various acts Barnum controls , and Barnum's weakest point is when Mr . Walsh and he quarrel for a few years . Only at the tail end , when they have made their apologies , and Barnum offers Walsh a partnership , does he learn that his friend's first name is " Bailey " . This is as bad a conclusion as that of Don Ameche's biography about Stephen Foster . As has been mentioned in the other review of this film here , Barnum's brilliant business partner was James Bailey . Show Walsh to the " Egress " . The other roles include various Barnum celebrities and fakes : Joyce Heth , the Feejee ( " Fiji " ) Mermaid , the Cardiff Giant , General Tom Thumb , Jumbo , and , of course , Virginia Bruce as Jenny Lind . The fact that Barnum actually improved the entertainment of the masses in America is not commented on ( his Museums had lectures in them , and he tried to stress some educational features in his menageries and circuses dealing with animals ) . His love of fooling the public ( which laughed at his fooling ) is emphasized . It's an entertaining enough movie , but try to catch the television films starring Burt Lancaster or Beau Bridges to get a closer look at the real man Phineas Taylor Barnum , one time member of the Connecticut Legislature ( and nearly Governor of Connecticut ) , and one of the 19th Century's most colorful and memorable figures . And , if you have a chance , go to Bridgeport and see his home , which is a famous circus museum now - fittingly enough .
492122	3280905	30631	7.0	A Nice , Forgettable Little Comedy	I recall that for many years this was the only one of Harold Lloyd's movies that occasionally turned up on screen in New York City . It is a passably funny film about an archaeologist who falls for the daughter of a tycoon and finds himself fighting the forces of Wall Street and fate itself to get the young lady . Lloyd's character is trying to fight an apparent curse from the tomb that he opened . The film literally goes to it's conclusion before the viewers learn if the curse will or will not work . Lloyd is ably supported in the film by Raymond Walburn , William Frawley , Lionel Stander , and Thurston Hall . Phyllis Welch was the young woman Lloyd pursues . She did nicely in the role , but not spectacularly . Her career soon faded from sight . Of the sound films made by Lloyd , " Professor Beware " usually is near the bottom . It is better ( in my opinion ) than " Welcome Danger " or " Feet First " , but it falls below the other four sound films . The problem with it is that it lacks any relationship to the type of film identified with Lloyd at his peak . It's situation comedy plot could have been done by most other comedians or leading men of the day . But it is not a total failure , and is worth watching .
492354	3280905	63220	7.0	A Forgotten Christmas Television Show	This was an hour long television show of 1968 , the year I entered high school . I watched it because one of the stars was a favorite of mine : James Mason . Ironically the narrator was Kirk Douglas , Mason's co-star in the Walt Disney production of Jules Verne's 20 , 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA . Note that the cast given here only mention those two performers . There were far more . The story follows how Pastor Josef Mohr wrote the words of a little poem about the year 1810 , and showed it to his friend Franz Gruber ( Mason ) who was the local church organist . Gruber succeeded in creating ( apparently the only time in his career ) a first rate piece of music for a setting for Mohr's words . Because this is the only work by the two men that we recall neither man has become a household name . Yet at the time it was created in Saltzburg , Austria , the tune was so well-liked that ( as one of the characters says to Gruber ) many thought it was composed by the late , great Josef Haydn ( of the 109 symphonies , such as the " London " and " Surprise " Symphonies ) - Haydn had just died in 1809 . The film shows how gradually recognition for their joint contribution to the Christmas season came to Gruber and Mohr , although sadly enough Mohr had prematurely died soon after the finished composition was first played . The show was well produced and acted ( Mason pulled out his best style for it ) , but it has never ( to my knowledge ) been revived in the forty years since it was shown on Christmas Day in 1968 . Perhaps it no longer exists . If it does , it could easily stand a revival .
493322	3280905	592466	7.0	The Events Leading to a Tragedy , August 1876	James Butler Hickok made himself one of the great Western legends of his time , first as an ace Pony Express rider , than as a scout for the Union Armies in the Civil War , then as a gunslinger turned lawman ( the Marshall of Abilene , Kansas ) . He was a remarkably fast draw - there is a story ( it's hard to tell how true it is ) that when he was Marshall , both John Wesley Hardin and Ben Thompson were in Abiline drinking together , and considering confronting Hickok to see who was faster . If the story is true , neither Hardin nor Thompson was willing to confront Hickok , after he managed to demonstrate ( peacefully ) how much quicker he was on throwing their preparatory movements towards grabbing their guns than they expected . But by 1869 Hickok was out of the gunfighter trade , and shortly moved east to New York City . This episode of THE GREAT ADVENTURE starred Lloyd Brides as Hickok , and explained what it was that made him lose his interest in his gunfighting career at it's peak . It turned out to be a combination of two factors . In one of the most notorious actions of his career as Marshall , Hickok ( while checking out an area for some criminals ) , thought he heard one of them behind him , rapidly turned around and fired , and killed the man who was behind him . Unfortunately it happened to be his deputy , who was also a close personal friend . The other thing was that Hickok's powers were ebbing . Always a keen-sighted man , his eyesight was failing . So this episode , after spending twenty minutes showing the Hickok of frontier legend , turned to the guilt-ridden man struggling to preserve his sight with eyeglasses . Bridges did a good job as Hickok , but it is the scene of him in the East , reading in a parlor with a pair of spectacles on that always remained on my mind . He could not stand the East . Unlike his old friend Bill Cody , Hickok felt constrained in the East . So in 1876 , hearing of the gold discoveries in the Black Hills , Hickok left his wife and headed for the town of Deadwood in the Dakota territory . He had set himself up there , when he was shot to death from behind by Jack McCall , a young desperado who wanted to make a reputation for himself as a gunslinger . Hickok was playing cards at the time . Traditionally he held a pair of aces and a pair of eights in his poker hand - what has since become known as " the Deadman's hand " .
491717	3280905	38961	7.0	A Fair Introduction to a Popular Comedy Short Series	Because of television , most people in the baby boomer generation and since think of comedy shorts as restricted to Laurel & Hardy , the Three Stooges , the Little Rascals ( " Our Gang " ) , Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd and that's about it . Actually there were plenty of short subject comedians about ( Burns and Allen , W . C . Fields , Clark & McCullough , Thelma Todd with either Zazu Pitts or Patsy Kelly , Edgar Kennedy , Leon Errol , Grady Sutton , and Robert Benchley to name some of the better known ones ) . In the 1940s two other series were created . One was Pete Smith's series of shorts ( wherein Mr . Smith was the wise guy narrator ) , and the " Behind the Eight Ball " or " So You Want To Be . . . " series by Richard Bare - starring George O'Hannion as " Joe McDoakes " ( Bare's comic turn on " Everyman " ) . In Bare's series , O'Hannion / McDoakes gets involved in some situation or is attracted to some job or hobby , that turns the short into a comic form of " How to " or better " How not to " do something . The entire idea is that no matter what you ( " Everyman " ) would like to accomplish , most of the time the average fellow ( or woman - sometimes a woman is involved ) can't really do it . This seems shortsighted , but unless we accept the inevitable failure of poor McDoakes attempts . . . well we won't have an amusing short before the feature then , will we ? Other episodes of the series included , " So You Want to Be a Detective " , and " So You Want to Be a Dancer " . No matter how much poor Joe tries to do things by the book he always comes a cropper . He either is not smart enough , or lacks the imagination to see what is around the possible corners of his actions . Here we start off with Joe in the shower . The narrator ( the always dependable Art Gilmore ) catches his attention , but Joe does not want to be seen by an audience while bathing . Gilmore reassures Joe that only men are in the audience , so Joe allows Gilmore and the camera to see him getting washed ( of course from the middle of the back up ) - but Gilmore ( sotto voce ) tells the ladies to just restrain from laughing for a moment or two ) . As I said , Joe lacks imagination - like some stranger might lie about who sees you naked . It turns out that Joe is using a bad choice for a shampoo , and as a result he is losing hair ( actually most people lose dead hair when they are washing in a shower or bath ) . Although Joe has a good head of hair he becomes concerned about massive hair loss . So he asks his barber about this . His barber ( Paul Panzer ) insists that he shouldn't massage his scalp . But a second barber ( Leo White ) insists he should massage his scalp ! So it goes , with it soon apparent that on the subject of hair and baldness nobody really has an answer . The series shows Joe trying everything " the experts " suggest , and even seeking the help of books on baldness . But nothing seems to work . He even goes to a specialty hair institute where he is given the works ( quite literally ) with electricity . In the end . . . well you can watch it and see the result . It is fairly amusing ( the one possible catch is a running gag with " Iron Eyes " Cody as an Indian ( get it . . . nudge , nudge . . . " scalp treatment " ) ) several times in the episode . That seems rather dated . But if one keeps in mind it is set in 1946 the general amusement of the short is still effective . Oddly enough , although now sixty years old , the central issue of the short is still true : there is still no real cure for baldness . Of course , they did not mention that heredity really plays a major role in people having hair into old age - there is nothing really funny about heredity . The only addition to the short , if done nowadays , would have been to have Joe experiment with getting hair plugs , as the late Senator William Proxmire did . But one wonders if there is much humor in that either .
491654	3280905	68108	7.0	The First " Masterpiece Theatre " " Who Dunnit ? "	I have had mixed feelings about this series since I first saw it in the early 1970s . I read THE MOONSTONES in the late 1960s , and enjoyed Wilkie Collin's blending of a detective story with his social comments about Victorian hypocrisy and hypocrites . It was the first Collins ' novel I read ( THE WOMAN IN WHITE followed within two years ) . Then I heard that it was going to be on " Masterpiece Theatre " . It excited me to see that two of the stars of THE FORSYTE SAGA were in it ( Martin Jarvis and John Welsh ) , and I looked forward to it . Alistaire Cooke's introduction was also increasing my expectations . He pointed out it was the first " Who Dunnit " on " Masterpiece Theatre " . The series did tell the story of the novel , but I found it disappointing . Not that the acting and production was poor , but they did not follow the organization of the novel as Collins thought it out . Collins had different characters in the novel tell the story in overlapping manner ( like Welles and Mankiewicz did in the screenplay for CITIZEN KANE ) so that we got different perspectives on the actions and on the characters . This was jettisoned : so we missed the character of Miss Clack , and her self-serving religiosity , and barely got Gabriel Betteridge's love of using Defoe's ROBINSON CRUSOE as a source of philosophy . If you have read THE MOONSTONES you can tell this is a serious loss . The plot of the novel is simple . Rachel Verrinder ( Vivien Heilbron ) is celebrating her coming of age birthday , and her mother Lady Verrinder ( Kathleen Byron ) is having a party for her , to which is invited some of the friends and young beaus interested in her . In particular Franklin Blake ( Robin Ellis ) and Godfrey Ablewhite ( Martin Jarvis ) . The household plans are aided by Lady Verrinder's butler Gabriel Betteridge ( Basil Dignam ) . But as the festivities are about to begin , a testamentary gift is sent to the house that Lady Verrinder is not too happy about . Her ladyship's uncle had been kept at arm's length since her childhood by the family - he gained a fortune by unscrupulous methods ( including violence and murder ) in a " battle " in India in 1799 at Seringapatam . The uncle felt the universal dislike , and became reclusive . Now he sends ( in his will ) a very valuable jewel : The Moonstone , possibly the rarest diamond in the world . It is his gift to his unseen grand niece , and , yet , Lady Verrinder has forebodings that it is pure evil . Soon it seems to be attracting unease among everyone . Three mysterious Indians show up in the English countryside for no reason , and keep approaching the house . Rachel is favoring Franklin as a possible fianc√© over Godfrey , but they have a quarrel . Then the diamond vanishes . The local police come in and are totally inept , especially as they tend to dismiss the investigation they should be conducting when Lady Verrinder orders it . A servant girl with a past named Roseanna Spearman ( Anna Cropper ) attracts some attention , but nothing is accomplished . Public opinion insists on action , and Scotland Yard sends it's best detective , Sergeant Cuff ( John Welsh ) . Immediately the investigation starts getting really serious . Cuff does not care who is shielding who , or whether the parties involved are nobility and gentry or not . He goes out of his way to solve the case . Soon he is aware that Lady Verrinder's interference is due to the behavior of Rachel , and that Rachel's seems pegged on her feelings about Franklin . Still he is also aware of the odd behavior of Spearman , who he tries to question ( and who keeps putting him off ) . Ablewhite also leaves rather early , as did several other guests . The fact that a nightgown is missing that is a vital clue is bothering him . He appears to be approaching a solution , when Spearman commits suicide . The local police Superintendent Foley causes a backlash , forcing Cuff to be recalled . And the case is left unresolved , until two years pass . And I will leave it at that . When Collins wrote the novel in 1868 he was using elements from several recent events . One was the Road Murder Mystery of 1860 . If you have seen the complete version of DEAD OF NIGHT , you see part of that story when Sally Ann Howes meets the little boy ghost . This is the murder of Francis Saville Kent , possibly by his half-sister Constance Kent . A leading clue in that case was a missing nightgown belonging to Constance . The detective on the case was Inspector Jonathan Whicher , got recalled when local opinion swerved against him after he began suspecting Constance . He was recalled , and like Cuff was forced to resign ( and like Cuff was subsequently vindicated to see his suspicions proved apparently true ) . Professor Richard Altick also found that a later incident in the story was based on an 1864 crime , " the Northumberland Street outrage " , involving waylaying a person into a house . The performances were good though , despite the change of the novel's story-making structure . Welch's Cuff was perhaps too restrained ( the novel pushes his habit of growing roses and humming " The Last Rose of Summer " ) . Robin Ellis was on the edge of television stardom ( POLDARK was in the future ) but he gave a good performance as Franklin , who finds the discovery of the truth more upsetting than he bargained for . Cropper's Spearman was very sympathetic , as the cursed jewel's unexpected victim . The show was , if not all it should have been , a good dramatization .
492587	3280905	47679	7.0	A Cunning Adversary	There should be a sub-genre in thrilling writing about the stories where somebody stumbles , accidentally , into witnessing a major crime but the perpetrator keeps countering each move with one of his or her own . The reviews on this thread keep referring to Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW , which certainly is the best known version of this plot , except for one element that is not in that film until very late . A better film to compare WITNESS TO MURDER to is actually THE WINDOW with Bobby Driscoll , Arthur Kennedy , and Paul Stewart . Difference between WITNESS and REAR WINDOW , of course , is that in the latter film Raymond Burr is unaware of why he is the center of so much attention by the police until he sees Grace Kelly's gesture regarding his wife's ring and the only person who can see it is Jimmy Stewart across the courtyard of the apartment buildings . Then he realizes who has been tipping the cops off about him . But that is about ten minutes before the end of the film . The situation in WITNESS TO MURDER is almost identical to THE WINDOW . Barbara Stanwyck happens to see a woman being strangled in an apartment near her's by George Sanders . But Sanders ( like Paul Stewart in THE WINDOW , notices her and prepares accordingly . He ( like Stewart ) has nothing to hide when the police ( Gary Merrill and Jesse White ) show up . He is soon analyzing Stanwyck for them as a neurotic spinster who hallucinates . And he is quite convincing . The difference between Sanders and Paul Stewart in their comparative film parts is that Stewart killed his victim in an argument over business ( Sanders was in a sexual rage ) . Moreover , whatever one thinks of Stewart's glib and careful killer , he is not getting deeper and deeper into crime out of any political or intellectual views . Put another way : if Bobby Driscoll had not witnessed what happened , but was sound asleep ( and Stewart was sure of it ) , Stewart would have hidden the dead body somewhere , and he and Ruth Roman would have packed up and moved to another city . Roman's loyalty to him would have reassured that there wouldn't have been any problems on that end . But with Sanders he approaches the situation from a " spiritual " side that Stewart would have found incomprehensible . We learn ( and it is a point that Merrill finds odd and troubling ) that this suave , courteous , and intellectual man is a defender of Nietzche's " superman " theories ( as twisted by the Nazis ) and apologist for the policies of the Nazis in several books . His treatment of his initial victim , and his subtle and continuous persecution of Stanwyck are of a piece ( he does not believe such inferior types should threaten him ) . Towards the end he even intends to make her death appear to be a suicide . Stewart felt Driscoll was a viable threat to his freedom and security , but he never has a speech suggesting the boy was a biological inferior . WITNESS TO MURDER is a good thriller , but it is not one of the all time great ones . Still it is a worthy picture , the only one where Stanwyck and Sanders appeared in together . So I give it a " 7 " on the scale , recommending it as an interesting version of the hunted turned hunter genre of thriller .
493250	3280905	32285	7.0	Eddie and his " Pretensions "	I agree with another writer on this thread that this should have been a better film - but it suffered from a poor script . Until he became a major star ( possibly Hollywood's biggest star ) in the 1940s , Humphrey Bogart was doomed to rarely be more than a movie menace . Prior to HIGH SIERRA and THE MALTESE FALCON a role like his horse trainer in DARK VICTORY or his frightened stooge of a Klan group in BLACK LEGION were rarities . Most of his roles were villains . Against Cagney in THE ROARING TWENTIES and THE OKLAHOMA KID . Against Flynn and Randolph Scott in VIRGINIA CITY . And definitely against Eddie Robinson in KID GALAHAD , THE AMAZING DR . CLITTERHOUSE , and this film . As we will see , it is a little odd that he got cast as a thuggish villain so often ( even with his harsh if handsome presence ) , particularly in a film like BROTHER ORCHID . For Bogie happened not to be born in a city ghetto like Cagney , or raised in one like Robinson . He was born in an upper class background , the son of a society doctor . In fact , in his early stage training , he appeared in society comedies . Reputedly he was the first young actor to pop up in such a play through the garden doors into the crowded parlor , racket in hand , saying " Tennis , anyone ? " Actually ( and ironically , as he hated it ) the film that closest mirrored his early years was SABRINA , which Bogie did not make until the 1950s . On the other hand , his more successful fellow Warner Brothers actor , Eddie Robinson , relished a chance to alter his public image . Having achieved movie stardom as Rico in LITTLE CEASAR , Robinson constantly tried to get out of movie gangster-dome . Sometimes he succeeded ( like his biography films such as A DISPATCH FROM REUTERS and DR . EHRLICH'S MAGIC BULLET ) but more frequently the gangster film was altered - particularly the " comic ones " . CLITTERHOUSE , for example , has a whimsical premise of a society doctor gathering material for his opus on the criminal mind by becoming one . Better examples are THE WHOLE TOWN IS TALKING , whereas a befuddled little clerk is constantly dragged into crime by his resemblance to a crime kingpin , or A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER ( wherein beer baron Remy Marko has a whole slew of problems to straighten out in one afternoon ) . BROTHER ORCHID takes off on a different slant regarding Robinson . A Roumanian ( and Jewish ) immigrant , Emmanuel Rosenberg happened to be pretty well read and educated , and continued showing interests in books and art all through his life . He was far from the " Ricos " he played on screen . Put another way : when he played " Wolf Larson " in THE SEA WOLF , the character personifies " Social Darwinism " . Robinson could have critiqued " Social Darwinism " . Naturally this culture business may have amused the Warners , and they had already lampooned it in an earlier Robinson film LITTLE GIANT , wherein ( again looking for class ) Robinson discovers that social position does not make a person nice or decent . There it was the family of Berton Churchill , all seeing him as a sucker to unload worthless stock on . In BROTHER ORCHID it is a gangster who finds that it is a whole change in his life's attitudes that is needed to gain real class . Robinson does a " Johnny Torrio " Act . He leaves his enterprises in the hands of his able lieutenant Bogart , while he takes a long trip to try to acquire class . Instead he slowly gets ripped off by every con-man and salesman who sees him coming . Finally he returns from Europe , and decides to resume his old job . But Bogie is well planted in the seat of power ( as Al Capone was when Torrio retired ) , and Robinson finds his girlfriend ( Anne Southern ) has married rancher Ralph Bellamy ( sort of a flip side to Bellamy's Oklahoma lover in THE AWFUL TRUTH ) . Bogie , seeing Robinson is trying to force his way back , has the latter taken for a ride and shot . But he is dumped on the grounds of a monastery run by Donald Crisp . Robinson is nursed back to health , and slowly begins to appreciate the finer things of a quiet , spiritual life . The problem of the script is that Robinson's second half should have emphasized his discovering spirituality . Actually the script began to do that at the best moment in the film , when Robinson is almost thrown out of the order due to violating a rule , and protests that it was just a momentary mistake on his part . Crisp decides to give him another chance . His growing abilities to work with flowers in the monastic garden ( the title is his name due to his abilities with orchids ) could have been used to expand on . Instead the film has to resume the gang warfare - the monastery's income is threatened by Bogie's mob , and Robinson ( with Southern and Bellamy's help ) beat Bogie's men . That's fine , but it threw aside the triumph of a real type of class that Robinson was finding . Possibly had the writers seen fit to have Bogart avoiding capture by the police because of Robinson and the monastery giving him a temporary sanctuary the story line could have been straightened out , with Bogart wondering in the end if he had really gotten the better of the deal . But unfortunately that was not done here . It is a moderately entertaining film , but it might have been a more meaningful one .
493358	3280905	50419	7.0	Gershwin , Paris , Astaire , Audrey Hepburn , Richard Avedon , and John-Paul Sartre	This 1957 musical is a little odd . It has a title based on an original 1920s Gershwin musical ( that included the title song ) which starred Fred and Adele Astaire . It was a musical and scenic valentine to France ( but only one tune in it deals with France - " Bonjour Paris ! " . It is a spoof on the modern fashion magazines , fashions in general , and advertising - but the spoof while sharp at times is never pushed . The opening sequence , " Think Pink , " describes how Kay Thompson plans a campaign to make the American woman go for " pink " clothes , accessories , toothpaste , etc . , only to admit to her assistant she personally loathes the color . It takes full advantage of the attractive face and features of Hepburn , who is convinced to be a model and help push a new line of fashions in Paris . And it makes two characters into imitations of Richard Avedon the photographer ( Astaire as Dick Avory ) and Jean-Paul Sartre ( Michel Auclair as Prof . Emile Flostre ) . Avedon was a rarity - a fashion photographer who became a great artistic portrait photographer . Astaire never is shown taking pictures of great or famous people in the film but several times he demonstrates a refinement that separates him from the rest of Kay Thompson's entourage ( most of whom don't care what havoc they cause , as long as they get their jobs done ) . He also has enough sense to question Hepburn's accepting of " empathicalism " , and it's viability . Witness his moment in the bistro pouring wine to the two old codgers who are quite pleasant to him while he insults them in English . Hepburn , of course , is so insistent on the validity of her philosophical beliefs that she rejects Astaire's warnings , and jeopardizes the fashion show . The final blow ( seemingly ) to the Astaire - Hepburn relationship is when he confronts Flostre at the author's home . He knocks out the Professor , and his brutality demolishes the relationship with Hepburn . But within minutes Hepburn sees another side to Flostre which is unexpected , and suddenly realizes that Astaire may be right after all . The character of Flostre is obviously based on that of Jean-Paul Sartre , the founder of " existentialism " . Based on in some details , but not in theory . " Empathicalism " has to do with trying to empathize with others so as to have a proper response to their needs and aspirations . " Existentialism " has to do with : " An introspective humanism or theory of man which expresses the individual's intense awareness of his contingency and freedom ; a theory which states that the existence of the individual precedes his essence . " This is from Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary . Sartre has a more complex view of man and society , and one can plow through BEING AND NOTHINGNESS to try to understand it . In fact some critics have wondered if the Nobel Prize Winner eventually got very wrong headed about his theory . But he certainly seems a meatier philosopher than his celluloid copy . But Flostre does have the trappings of Sartre on him . He is revered by his followers world wide ( such as Hepburn ) . He is a man with sexual appetite ( as Sartre was with his long time companion and fellow writer Simone Beauvoir ) . And there is some traces of an anti-capitalist , even anti-American attitude in him . It is not definitely pushed , but when Astaire and Thompson break into his house during a party , they pretend they are American share cropper singers whom Flostre had brought to France to perform for his guests . Now , we never hear what this actual pair actually would sing , but judging from their background they would have to throw in some protest songs . Sartre was very critical of the U . S . A . and capitalism ( today his fans have to explain Sartre's willingness to accept Russian imperialist moves under Communism in the 1940s , 1950s , and 1960s - they find it very hard to do so ) . On the whole the parts of the film work well , so I give it seven stars . Kay Thompson is best recalled for being the creator of the little girl at the Plaza " Eloise " , but she shows here a highly entertaining performance as Maggie Prescott , the editor who pushes and loathes pink . The film would have been better if somehow Avedon's portrait photography had been brought into the story , possibly in a final scene with Flostre as his subject . However , even without such a sequence the film is rewarding to watch , especially in the musical numbers . Astaire does equally well with Thompson and with Hepburn as his partners here .
492374	3280905	39242	7.0	" You Will Shun Him . "	Captain Charles Cunningham Boycott is one of those figures in history who by their careers or actions actually contributed to our language - usually without thinking about it . Lord Cardigan , who led the charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War , wore a tight sweater which still bears his name . Lord Brougham , the great lawyer and Lord Chancelor , had a special carriage designed for him , which is named for him . William Burke ( with his partner William Hare ) suffocated a dozen people to sell their bodies to Dr . Robert Knox , the anatomist . The method of suffocation is still called " burking " . Reverend Spooner's weird confusion of letters and syllables is still called a " spoonerism " . The edited censorship of literary masterpieces is called bowdlerizing after Bowdler the originator of the censorship . Captain Boycott is remembered for not what he did or wore or said . He is recalled for what was done to him because of his behavior to others . In 1878 the lower classes in Ireland began a series of acts of violence against landlords , especially Protestant landlords . The reasons were connected with unfairly high rents and misuse of economic power to force people to do what their landlords wanted them to do . The worst incidents resulted in the murders of landlords ( Lord Leitrim in 1878 , Lord Mountmorres in 1880 ) and Mr . Walter Bourke ( an agent for a landlord ) in 1882 . Boycott was a rather heavy handed landowner , who threw out tenants who did not do what he wanted ( including voting for Tory candidates ) . He became targeted for punishment , but what happened turned out to be more effective and less bloody than what happened to Leitrim , Mountmorres , and Bourke . On the advice of cooler heads than armed terrorists , such as political leader Charles Stewart Parnell , it was advised to socially and emotionally ostracize Boycott . Instead of threatening his possession of his estate ( which would allow him to call in British troops ) the locals would not sell him needed food or supplies , nor do work on his estate , nor even talk to him and his staff . This ostracism ( now called " boycotting " ) proved very effective - it led to Boycott , after nearly half a year's struggle , to give up his estate and leave Ireland forever . The movie basically tells the story , with Cecil Parker actually playing the central role of Captain Boycott . Parker plays one of his rare negative characters , but he has moments of typical befuddled Parker humor ( when talking to a friend about the unwanted London reporters in his home following the ostracism campaign , he notes the reporter for the TIMES appears to be drunk under his dinner table - we see the man's legs ) . Since he is the villain actually ( with Mervyn Johns as his sneaky estate agent ably assisting him ) , we look elsewhere for our hero . Here it is Stewart Granger , as an independent minded tenant of Boycott's , whose prize race horse excites the Captain's greed . But Granger is also a voice of reason . Although he doesn't care for Parnell ( he mentions rumors about Parnell's sex life ) , he hears the great man give a speech advocating peaceful protest rather than violence . This is how the campaign against Boycott begins . Alistair Sim plays the local Catholic pastor , who also counsels peaceful protest . Noel Purcell plays an interesting semi-villain - the local schoolteacher who is an accomplished agitator ( for violence ) . And playing Parnell for one scene only is Robert Donat , who gives the great man's speech his normal eloquence , and actually looks like Parnell ( unlike Clark Gable in the 1939 biographical fiasco from Hollywood ) . A little stiff at times , it is ( on the whole ) a wonderful example of a good historical movie . As such I recommend catching it when you can .
491709	3280905	41610	7.0	The Root of All Evil	The " Lost Dutchman " Gold Mine has entered American folklore as one of those unattainable , and menacing , treasures . Supposedly Jacob Walz found it in the Superstition Mountains of Arizona , and died without ever revealing fully it's location . At least a dozen people have died violently searching for it . Therefore this film easily adds to the story of greed and blood that covers the wealth of that forgotten mine . I liked the negative performances of the leads ( Ford , Lupino , and Young ) , none of whom are likable or redeemable . It was very unusual to see them in such characterizations ( although Lupino had played some villainous types , like " Betsy Broke " in " The Light That Failed " ) . Young was still a few years from his first decent role , the weak drunkard in " Come Fill The Cup " . Ford usually played good guys , although he did play the politically ambitious Civil War madman in " The Man From Colorado " in this period . But here they all cut their teeth quite well in the film as low lives . The interesting thing is that they are not the only villains - greed also percolates in the modern part of the movie , where the hero ( William Prince ) discovers the most unlikely , deadly villain facing him at the end . Altogether a worthwhile film .
491640	3280905	47349	7.0	Made For Each Other	It is not the greatest comedy in the world , nor the greatest film of either it's two stars ( nor it's two lead supporting players ) , nor the best film it's two stars made together , nor the best film script of George Axelrod . But PHFFFT is a good comedy about marriage and divorce , and in it's point of view resembles a film made a decade earlier in England called VACATION FROM MARRIAGE , about how their experiences in World War II separately rejuvenate the love and affection in Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr's doldrum like marriage . Fortunately Jack Lemmon and Judy Holiday don't need anything so desperate . Lemmon is a former naval officer who is a tax lawyer and has met Holiday , an employee of a major network , in the waning days of World War II . They start dating , and end up marrying just at the point that his career in the Navy ends ( and he hooks up in a good law firm ) and her career zooms as the author of a major radio soap opera ( which in 1954 was still quite a big thing ) . But as they are both prospering in their careers , they tend to drift a bit apart . We see Lemmon ( after dinner with Holiday ) getting sexual excitement reading a " Mickey Spillaine " type novel ( how Ensign Pulver would have understood that ) , and a slow simmering Judy watching him for some kind of action towards her . Finally she asks him for a divorce . Surprisingly he agrees , as he feels there is nothing left in their marriage at this point . She gets a divorce very quickly ( by the way - small note - her taxi driver taking her away from the courthouse is Jimmy Dodd of the Mickey Mouse Club fame : this is the first time I have seen him in anything except the Mickey Mouse Club ) . But soon Judy ( under the wing of her mother , Luella Gear ) finds she is not finding any fulfillment in her new freedom . Her first date is with an actor from her soap opera , who instead of romancing her starts discussing writing a rival character ( actually the central character ! ) out of some of the scripts . Her attempts at foreign language studies ( she is planning a trip to France ) does not work . And her mother's redecoration ( a round bed ) is not really great . But Jack is not doing well either . Setting up with his old navy buddy , Jack Carson ( mentally I compared their relatively easy relationship to Jack's classic problems with Walter Matthau in later films ) , and finding that Carson's solutions are not all great . He wants Jack to jump back into the dating game - and volunteers Kim Novak for that . Novak is playing her part like a clone ( except in terms of hair style ) to Marilyn Monroe . She has the wide eyed naivet√© mixed with a large dollop of common sense about what she is around for . But it is a clone performance , and one welcome later performances of Novak in both comedy ( BELL , BOOK , AND CANDLE ) and drama ( VERTIGO ) to see what she would turn out to be capable of doing . Jack does lighten up - he first buys a sporty little Austin to drive around in , and he does take dance lessons ( as does Judy ) . The latter leads to the real highlight of the film : when both arrive at a night spot with dates , end up on the dance floor doing the rumba and the mambo , and managing to transform their dancing into a momentary charge of sexual attraction between them . From that point one realizes it is only a matter of time before they return together . Carson has one major scene as well . He decides ( erroneously , as it turns out ) that since Jack and Judy are divorced , he can date Judy . As this is an Axelrod script , there is a bit of THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH here , as Carson tells Judy of his noticing " types " who are dating . It reminds one of Tom Ewell talking or thinking of sexual problems or matters in the other film . It is a neat little time capsule in many ways . Made today , the sexual aspect would be more outspoken , but it was made in the quieter ( perhaps too quieter ) Eisenhower Era . Even the title is a bit of a time capsule artifact : " Phffft " ( pronounced with a bit of air in the voice as " fitt " ) was a term used by Walter Winchell in his gossip column to say that a loving celebrity couple was splitting . It's brief , final sound ( like a rip or a whistle of air ) suggested that these romances were brief things . But who remembers Winchell these days - his columns are useful in doing research for books on old celebrities . Still the movie itself was a nice romantic comedy , and worth watching .
492019	3280905	14811	7.0	Before Betty Boop And Popeye	Max Fleischer's cartoons in the 1920s centered around the antics of a clown named Koko . The clown was seen to emerge from the ink in a freshly dipped pen being applied by Fleischer to the pad on his easel . Hence the name of the series : " OUT OF THE INKWELL " . Then , with a total ease of control , Fleischer would put Koko through his paces in an escalating series of problems based on some normal situation that grew out-of-hand . In THE CURE ( 1924 ) , Koko is drawn walking his pet rabbit . Suddenly we see he has a bulge in his mouth , which we realizes is some type of tooth ache . He asks ( using a title card ) why Fleischer drew him with a tooth ache , and we see Fleischer also has one . The rabbit soon is examining Koko's mouth and manages to push the bulb about into his head and neck before removing it - it turns out to be a large apple . They now concentrate on Fleischer , and tie a rope to the latter's bad tooth . They give Fleischer some laughing gas , and return to their pad to pull the tooth out . What follows is Koko and the rabbit finding they have a dentist office complete with waiting room , patients , and dentist chair . The cartoon follows Dr . Koko taking care of patients ( one of whom , a lion , keeps knocking off Koko's temporary " Doctor's eyeglasses " ) . A series of site gags involving the use of a miniature Brooklyn Bridge and other similar objects as visual puns ( for a " bridge " in that particular gag ) occur . Fleischer also turns on the laughing gas to affect the drawn cartoon figures . And in the end his own tooth is removed as well . Finally , at the end of the cartoon Koko and the rabbit and other figures return back to the inkwell . There are better cartoons , even better in this series , but this one is not a bad one to start off with . Fleischer never got into the habit of building up a story ( like Disney eventually did ) that led naturally into realistic situations or into situations based on a source ( like Disney would find in say Collodi's PINOCCHIO ) , until his later full length cartoons like GULLIVER'S TRAVELS . Most of his cartoons would concentrate on a simple situation that sight gags can be built into . It was not a bad formula , and would be honed by Koko , and later used more successfully with Betty Boop and then Popeye . Only after GULLIVER did Fleischer's studios look at short cartoons with an integrated story line dominating - the SUPERMAN series .
492718	3280905	507813	7.0	And Farmers Said That at 10 : 00 P . M . the Moon turned Red	I mentioned this episode in passing in my general review of ONE STEP BEYOND . The death of Abraham Lincoln has bred an entire mythology of it's own , due to the reverence felt towards the 16th President , and even shared ( ironically ) by his killer John Wilkes Booth . A good place to start studying it is in JIM BISHOP'S THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT , but also read Lloyd Lewis's MYTHS AFTER LINCOLN , Theodore Roscoe's WEB OF CONSPIRACY , and William Hanchett's THE LINCOLN MURDER CONSPIRACIES . Like the odd story about Morgan Robertson's novella FUTILITY : THE WRECK OF THE TITAN which mirrored the 1912 Titanic Disaster but was written in 1898 , there are verifiable stories regarding Lincoln's death that are matters of record . For example Lincoln's dreams . He had two in particular that several of his associates and friends knew of . During the course of the war , Lincoln had a dream in which he was on a ship that was crossing an ocean , and headed for some distant place . It usually reappeared ( that is , Lincoln dreamed it ) whenever a major battle or event of the war was about to occur . He dreamed it shortly after Lee's surrender , except he now saw the outline of a distant shore ( he hadn't before ) . Everyone suspected it had to do with Lee's Surrender , not with Lincoln's possible death . Better known was his dream of waking in the middle of the day , and walking from his bedroom , and going to the East Room where many people were walking and moaning and crying . Lincoln saw them surrounding an object , and asked what it was . Someone says , " It was the President . He was killed by an assassin . " Again many people are on record as having heard this . But there were other events - I alluded to one in the " Summary Line " . Farmers in the Midwest claimed that the Moon turned blood red at 10 : 00 P . M . - the hour and moment Booth fired his bullet into Lincoln's head . The episode was done very well . Newland handled it tactfully . I mentioned ( in the general review of the series ) that it begins with Newland looking at an antique pocket watch . He points out it is running . It has the initials of it's owners on it : " J . W . B . " Newland adds that the owner is a murderer . And we know who owns the watch . Lincoln always had a feeling of fatalism about his job , because he knew the passions that were directed towards him and his policies by half the country ( sometimes more than half ) . His step-mother Sarah had always felt dread at his political success , and openly said that he'd never return to Springfield alive . Yet , to be fair to Lincoln , he did have post-Presidential plans . He hoped to travel with Mary and his sons abroad after his Presidency , and possibly see California as well . A fantasy novel , THE MISSING YEARS , showed what might have happened if Lincoln had been able to struggle with Booth instead of just getting shot . But his general fatalism , and his willingness to accept the risks ( which included at least two other attempts on his life ) put a downer on his existence - one that may have been shared by his wife and son Robert . The episode is stiff at times , but it's inevitability enhances the tale . Again it is worth watching .
493335	3280905	26104	7.0	Great Victorian Novel becomes Interesting Looking But Weak Film	Because of the overwhelming success of his novels , people still read Charles Dickens . If you poled people who like to read classic novels , you would find most people read Dickens , Emily and Charlotte Bronte , and Anthony Trollope most among the " high Victorian " novelists ( those from 1830 - 1882 ) . This cuts out a large number of fine novelists , like George Eliot , George Meredith , Elizabeth Gaskell , and Benjamin Disraeli ( yes , the Prime Minister ) , or even William Wilkie Collins , the first great mystery / detective novelist . But the one that is particularly odd is William Makepeace Thackeray . In his day ( he was a prominent novelist from 1839 to 1863 when he died ) Thackeray was actually the leading rival of Dickens as the leading novelist . Dickens was capable of a wider variety of social class types in his fiction , and could show wilder humor and greater tragedy in his novels . But Thackeray was more gifted at subtle characterization and clever social satire of the upper class . He was a member of that class , and knew what he was talking about when he wrote about them . George Orwell noted that when Dickens did an aristocrat in like Sir Mulberry Hawk in " Nicholas Nickleby " , the resulting character was a type from Victorian melodrama , whereas Thackeray or Trollope made more realistic figures . He also was willing to experiment in odd ways . Occasionally Dickens did too - he did first person narrative novels like " David Copperfield " and once did one with a female narrator " Bleak House " . But in 1846 Thackeray wrote " Vanity Fair , A Novel Without A Hero " . The title was a pun . The two leading characters , Rebecca ( Becky ) Sharp and Amelia Sedley , are women ( so it suggests the novel has a " heroine " ) . But both women are quite faulty . Becky is a fortune hunter who won't let anyone or anything keep her from becoming rich . Amelia is a nice person . In fact , she is too nice . She has to go through an 800 page story before she stops being friendly to her school friend Becky , and only after Becky reveals what a bad person she has been to Amelia . None of the characters in " Vanity Fair " is flawless . The closest to a hero in the story , William Dobbin , adores Amelia - but won't push himself as a suitor ( he wants her to notice his adoration by herself ) . Becky vamps members of the Crawley family ( where she is the family governess ) , and marries the second son , Rawdon , in expectation of a generous aunt's largesse to support them . But that fails to work out . So she tags along with Rawdon , accompanying him on the Waterloo campaign , and makes a play for George Osbourne ( Amelia's selfish husband ) . Eventually she and Rawdon become social figures , " living well on nothing a year " ( by cheating merchants of payments for their food , clothes , etc ) . She also becomes the mistress of the powerful Marquis of Steyne ( pronounced " stain " ) . How the events of this novel without a hero end I leave to the reader to read the novel ( the best way ) or to see either this version by Rouben Mamoulian , the recent one with Reese Witherspoon , or a modern dress version from 1932 with Myrna Loy as Becky . Mamoulian's version reduces the story to 90 minutes of film , and so much is thrown out . In particular the antics of Amelia's cowardly , pompous brother Joseph Sedley ( Nigel Bruce in Mamoulian's film ) . Hopkins does very well as Becky - garnering her best film performance . She is supported by Alan Mowbray as Rawdon , who may be raffish in some ways but gains our respect as he sees the woman he loves for what she is . Francis Dee is adequate ( if not memorable ) as Amelia . Cedric Hardwicke is sinister and powerful as Steyne . Allison Skipworth gives one a taste of the self-centered , pampered aunt of Rawdon , " Miss Crawley " . So what went right and wrong . It is a great novel ( my opinion ) but I admit this film leaves me cold . So much was cut out the film is just a synopsis of the main plot . But then , Thackeray's greatest strength as a satirist was as a subtle writer . Somehow subtlety on his printed page is not well translated onto the silver screen . On the other hand , Mamoulian did make great strides ( in terms of elegant cinematography ) with the then new three tone color film system . The best moment is at the scene of the great last ball given to Wellington's staff and men at Brussels in June 1815 , which ends as a cannon blast in the distance is heard : the opening shot of Waterloo . The moment that the blast is heard a blast of air causes a red curtain to blow , looking like a wave of blood . Mamoulian was able to squeeze out of the process some idea of what to do with it . For that reason the film is worth seeing . But I urge the interested viewer to take the time to read Thackeray's novel .
492035	3280905	550291	7.0	When nobody is cooperating	Captain Allbright , a wealthy landowner , has died under mysterious circumstances . He appears to have fled his home in the middle of the night , blindly running through the local woods , and fell to his death in a large stone and gravel pit . There are no signs of violence on his body , aside from the injuries sustained from the fall , as well as scratches on his face and hands , and torn clothing . But he is a wealthy man , and Chief Inspector Jowett is asked to look into it . So he sends Cribb and Thackeray to the village Allbright lived in . What follows is not a totally unknown situation in Britain or any other country . Frequently locals prove very uncooperative with police ( especially when the police come from a distant place ) . In my review of the movie KIDNAPPED , I mentioned the Appin Murder in 1752 of the " Red Fox " Colin Campbell in Appin Forest . Although James Stewart ( of the Glen ) was tried , convicted , and hanged for the murder , it is now recognized that family feuds ( between the Stewart / Stuarts of Scotland and the Campbells ) stemming from the Jacobite Revolt of 1745-46 of " Bonnie Prince Charlie " was at the root of the judicial murder of James of the Glen . The judge and jury were all Campbells . But the Stewarts in the area around Appin , to this day , know the actual killers of the " Red Fox " , but refuse to tell it to anybody outside of their family . Similarly , the killers of William Clemens , Third Earl of Leitrim in 1876 were Irishmen who hated this particularly callous landlord . It was not until 1960 that a monument to the three killers was put up giving their names ! Cribb and Thackeray find the same lack of cooperation in looking into the death of Captain Allbright . The locals just insist he was very ill , and in his fever and delirium he fled the safety of his bed and home , and ran amok until he fell to his death . It is a plausible scenario , but Cribb slowly finds inconsistencies about the story from the locals , most of whom claim they were at choir practice that night . SPOILERS COMING UP The plot becomes a 19th Century version of Agatha Christie's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS , without the train . The Captain was preventing his ward from marrying a well liked local boy , and this led to the locals deciding to teach the old man a lesson - there was an old custom to frighten recalcitrant or nasty locals by chasing them through the forest , and the choir members did just that . Unfortunately , Allbright did not just get scared into changing his mind - he fell to his death accidentally . Cribb takes the story back to Jowett , who is perplexed by this . It may mean hanging about ten people who were usually respectable , and for the murder of a person who behaved quite unreasonably . But Cribb does point out , the other version of the story ( that Allbright ran through the forest while delirious ) while odd is not impossible . Jowett sees the point - yes , it is not all that impossible . . . it probably did happen that way .
492427	3280905	460175	7.0	Another Funny ( if Dated ) Pollard Comedy on " YOU TUBE "	While not as funny as IT'S A GIFT , this Snub Pollard comedy has a build-up to a chase based on fears of ghosts . It just works - hurt only by some 1920 racist humor at the expense of African-Americans ( as servants ) . Snub is getting married and a rival decides to ruin the marriage on the wedding night in revenge . First he arranges to drive off with the bride in the wedding limousine ( Snub chases it , and when he catches it he has to ride holding onto the spare tire in the car's back ) . Next he arranges for a parrot that yells " Murder ! " and " Help ! " gets strategically placed under the happy couple's dining room table . Finally he tells Snub that there have been several tragedies in the house - at least one of a suicide and another of a bearded old geezer strangling and stabbing his wife . Snub is made nervous by this . But soon he starts seeing such an old geezer around the house . So do several of the servants , and finally Snub's bride ( Marie Mosquini - the future Mrs . Lee de Forrest ) . Soon figures under blankets show up as well - are they the ghost or various people ( including Snub ) hiding ? There are nice touches when a squadron of Policemen start racing around the house - one of them , a very fat one , keeps staying in the rear , sitting down in chairs and napping ( he always rejoins his buddies when they come back down stairs without missing a beat ) . But the bad bits are with the Black house servants - frequently panicking outlandishly ( even if Snub and Marie are too ) by the so-called ghost with the beard . The best one of them is Marie's maid , who is large like Louis Beavers or Hattie MacDaniel . She too hides , and chases Snub out of the bed she's hiding in when he jumps in . But that moment of independent action is rare compared to the rest of the house servant staff . The end result is very amusing , but the racism sticks in one's craw , so that the film can only get a " 7 " out of " 10 " from me . However , the conclusion ( dealing with a piece of the wedding cake ) is quite good - bringing back that fat cop and the youngest Black servant ( a little boy ) as well , and tastefully .
492519	3280905	28120	7.0	" First you question my financial resources , then you ask me business advice "	No it is not the greatest of W . C . Field's comedies - it does not rank with THE BANK DICK or IT'S A GIFT or THE OLD FASHIONED WAY or even MY LITTLE CHICKADEE . But POPPY is of considerable interests to the many fans of the great misanthropic comic . In 1923 he appeared on stage in POPPY as " EUSTACE McGARGLE " . It was the first lead role in a play ( as opposed to one or two comic supporting parts , and his years of vaudeville juggling / comic routines , or his years headlining in the Ziefeld Follies ) that FIelds had . Interestingly enough his performance on stage enabled him to cross paths with another future movie comedian ( though a lesser one in retrospect ) , Robert Woolsey ( of Wheeler and Woolsey ) , who appeared as a rustic victim of McGargle . The play gave Fields a " Fields " day as a carnival swindler , who was also the foster father of a young woman who Fields / McGargle would try to pass off as an heiress . The play was subsequently made into a silent film , " Sally of the Sawdust " ( Field's third silent movie , and first directed by the great D . W . Griffith ) . The silent version was actually a vehicle for Griffith's pitifully inadequate actress find Carol Dempster ( who was also his girlfriend at the time ) . It is also of interest because the boyfriend of Dempster was played by a young Alfred Lunt ( sadly Lynn Fontaine was not in this film ) . The 1925 " Sally of the Sawdust " had some good moments when Fields did his larcenous best - including a " heroic " scene at the end where he explains " Sally " ' s true parentage at court , and saves her from prison . But Dempster's attempts at " gamin " like cuteness are tiresome to a viewing today . Lunt does well , but is a distinctly supporting actor here . Fortunately sound came along , so that Mr . Lunt ( now with Lynn Fontaine ) would make THE GUARDSMAN and plenty of television appearances in the future to demonstrate their fine acting abilities . Ms Dempster , of course , just faded into oblivion . Fields too would benefit by sound , and would leave us that nasal twang that made us guffaw so much . And by doing " Poppy " as a sound film we were able to hear some of the dialog from the stage play that the silent film did not have . Mention has been made of three moments : the sale of the " talking dog " , the business with the hot dog vendor ( which is where the line at the start of this review comes from ) , and the business with the patent medicine purchaser ( " No more " ) . A fourth one is the sequence ( somewhat too brief ) where " Professor " McGargle entertains the guests at a society party with some high sounding concerto on a strange looking stringed instrument . He ends up playing " Pop Goes the Weasel " . At the end , when " Poppy " is revealed to really be the lost heiress , McGargle takes leave of his adopted daughter in a quiet , dignified way - not quite as tragic as a similar sequence in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY , perhaps , but equally not as tragic and total as his leaving her in the radio version of " Poppy " that was made within two years of the film . That version was put out on records about 1970 , and keeps to the story , but seems sadder than this movie or the 1925 silent version .
492018	3280905	20876	7.0	Sometimes a formula idea does not work well the second time	The coming of sound is erroneously said to have destroyed the careers of the great silent comedians . Not quite true , though some truth to it . Chaplin did not go fully into sound until 1940 with the generally excellent THE GREAT DICTATOR . Keaton actually went into the sound period with a final great silent film ( THE CAMERAMAN ) but problems with an unsympathetic ( even hostile ) Louis B . Mayer , divorce problems with his wife , and ( unfortunately ) alcoholism caused a serious collapse in his career . But he recovered slowly to be a fixture on television and in movies to the end of his career . Laurel & Hardy did better with sound than with silent films ( including getting into feature films ) . W . C . Fields also did better in sound films ( and so did the Marx Brothers after their fitful silent production ( s ) ) . After years in the wilderness due to scandal , Fatty Arbuckle was making a come-back when he died in 1933 . The only real casualties were Larry Semon ( who died in 1928 , presumably in part due to the collapse of his production company after some film failures ) , Raymond Griffith ( who was unable to speak loudly due to a physical problem - but would play his best remembered part as the dying French soldier in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT , and then have a great career in film production ) , and Harry Langdon ( whose career toppled over his egomania , according to Frank Capra ) . Langdon still managed to occasionally appear in films ( HALLELUJAH , I'M A BUM , ZENOBIA ) and did work as a gag writer for Hal Roach . Harold Lloyd found the coming of sound relatively easy . Unlike Keaton he did not have domestic problems or drinking problems that interfered with his career . Like Chaplin he had invested his sizable income into a wide variety of different businesses , and was rich enough to pick and choose his vehicles . But he made mistakes in his first two films that managed to show what was no longer possible . Lloyd's comedy was the comedy of suspense and danger . Lloyd's characters , whatever their social class , always had to overcome death defying or dangerous problems to reach their goals . This included winning a football match ( in THE FRESHMAN ) or capturing a murderer to free his father and brothers ( in THE KID BROTHER ) . His best remembered sequence of danger and humor was the climb up the side of the department store in the aptly titled SAFETY LAST ! SAFETY LAST ! appeared in 1922 . Eight years later Lloyd repeated the climbing sequence in FEET FIRST , his second talky , and his second error at trying to repeat the successful formula . The first film was a crime melodrama / comedy WELCOME DANGER , which was too long and complicated to be successful . The sections dealing with potential dangers were not well handled - some reversed the whole concept of sound films by having Lloyd and others talking in the dark ( sort of making the movie the equivalent of a radio ) . Lloyd apparently was trying to return to the success of SAFETY LAST ! , but failed to notice one aspect of the first talkie . Audiences were not thrilled to hear people in peril screaming for help . As a result the audiences were confused about what their responses to the " comedy " was to be . SAFETY LAST ! had a natural build-up to the last half hour of Harold's climb up the side of the department store to win $1 , 000 . 00 and get married to his girlfriend . FEET FIRST was also tied to a romance . Harold is working in a shoe store in Honolulu , when he meets a female customer who is the daughter of the store's owner . They are taking a boat back to the U . S . and Harold is accidentally made a stowaway . He has tried to impress the girl that he is a millionaire too . So now he is romancing the girl as a rich man , and also trying to avoid being thrown into the brig as a stowaway . At the end of the film the ship is in San Francisco , and Harold gets off the boat by hiding in a mail bag . But he is taken to an office building , and accidentally pulled up the side of the building ( in the bag ) many stories above the street . Harold cuts his way out of the bag , but he is soon struggling to get to safety . Here , unlike SAFETY LAST ! , he is heard yelling for help . This actually makes his danger all the more real . But it keeps the audience from enjoying Harold's predicament . An audience today would also resent the humor of Stepin ' Fetchit ( here called " Sleep ' N Eat " ) as the only person who tries to assist Harold - but moving and acting in stereotypical manner ( i . e . , when he sees Lloyd has fallen a few floors down , he asks , " Whatcha doin ' down there ? " ) . To be fair one sequence has both men frightened by a stuffed gorilla , but it is not enough to undue the bad taste of the racism . Some of the jokes are definitely based on originals from the silent film - when Harold reached the top in SAFETY LAST ! he got hit on the head by a machine . Here he reaches the roof , only to breath in some ether that makes him woozy . He also does fall off the roof at the end and actually ends up within feet of the street pavement . It's a neat switch , but it makes the climb upward seem meaningless at the conclusion . Individual scenes and sight gags are funny ( Lloyd as stowaway hiding behind a lifeboat , and a gull lies on his head ) . But the total effect is mediocre Lloyd at best . Fortunately Lloyd learned from his error . His next two films were both good ( MOVIE CRAZY and THE MILKY WAY ) showing he had learned a bit from the misfires of the first two films .
493295	3280905	29626	7.0	Supposedly One of Leisin's Best films	I first came across this film when I read a book ( written in the 1970s ) about the career of Mitchell Leisin . I have to admit that over the years I have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality . SWING HIGH , SWING LOW was supposed to be one of his best . While it did not bore me , it did not impress me as much as HOLD BACK THE DAWN , DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY , KITTY , or even GOLDEN EARINGS . I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked . Working at Paramount Leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals . Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre . It's true that twice standards appeared in his films , but they were really rare cases : " Cocktales for Two " appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES , and " Mona Lisa " came out of CAPTAIN CAREY , U . S . A . But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable . " Mona Lisa " was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY . It shouldn't have been this way - Leisin's studio had Rogers and Hart working for it in the early 1930s . Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them ? The score for SWING HIGH , SWING LOW , is pleasant but forgettable . Unfortunately , the movie is centered in the entertainment world , as Fred Macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player ( he even works Carole Lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet ) . The song ( sung by Lombard ) about how her lover's playing thrills her , is important to the plot . It works in the film , but it would have been better if the song was more memorable . There is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that Lombard works on , as a manicurist . She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn ( the ship's barber ) . Then the ship is entering into the Panama Canal , and we see MacMurray as a soldier , who's enlistment is ending shortly . Their first scene together has a nice Leisin touch in it : MacMurray is talking to Lombard , she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock . Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit . The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson ( MacMurray ) as he meets Lombard , and begins his reputation as a trumpet player , but meets the " other woman " in the film , Dorothy Lamore . The best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with Lombard , and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter ( his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a MacMurray character - even his darker figures like Walter Neff or Mr . Sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the Caine Mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol . Lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by MacMurray . Lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it , but one stands out is her attempt to get MacMurray onto the wagon again . In his opening bit Pangborn is fine . Rarely noticed in films , small part actor Carl Judels is effective as a fair weather fan / friend of MacMurray , who drops him as he goes under ( though he gives him a hand-out ) . Charles Butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual , but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he , his girlfriend , MacMurray , and Lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that MacMurray is insisting is true . It was a nice , subtle moment . If only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor .
492102	3280905	41855	8.0	A Good Example of MGM Ensemble Acting	This is a wonderful movie about how children can occasionally see things more clearly than adults . Herbert Marshall is Mr . Craven ( great name ) the owner of a country estate . His son ( Dean Stockwell ) is bedridden . Marshall is aware that his son is paralyzed , and knows the reason for it . It is the secret that has blighted his once happy and secure family life . A young girl ( Margaret O'Brien , in possibly her best role ) gets a position at the estate , and despite warnings from the landlady ( Dame Gladys Cooper ) gets involved with Stockwell . Stockwell is initially a spoiled brat , but he is so lonely he and O'Brien become friendly . With O'Brien's assistance ( and that of Brian Roper , a boy whose father works on the estate ) Stockwell starts improving . They take him out , and find a large garden that has been locked for years . Nobody is allowed in it by Marshall's orders . But the three children find a way to get in . They go there ( against the order of Marshall and Cooper ) and play in it . Meanwhile Marshall is toying with selling the estate and going abroad . He first has a doctor ( George Zucco , in a rare good person part ) examine Stockwell . Marshall is furious at Zucco's sensible observations that if the boy happens to get air and exercise he will recover . Marshall prefers an incompetent doctor ( Aubrey Mather ) who affirms that Stockwell is beyond hope . The climax is when Marshall is taught a valuable lesson in getting past the past to save the future - I will leave that for the readers of this review to see for themselves . Most of the film was done in black and white , except for one powerful moment at the conclusion . The performances , especially Marshall , Stockwell , and O'Brien , are all perfect in this film as we see how sometimes grown-ups are not as smart as their children .
492093	3280905	39110	8.0	An unusual Wayne flick - but a pretty good comedy .	The plot of WITHOUT RESERVATIONS is about how popular novelist Claudette Colbert is traveling to Hollywood to assist in the screenplay of her best selling novel . The producer is Thurston Hall . But his ideas are typically grandiose - get well known Hollywood stars for the film ( the names of Cary Grant and Lana Turner are being bandied about ) . Colbert feels the hero of her novel ( a Marine ) is someone that should be a new face - and so she is traveling across the country by train looking for such a face . She meets two air force fliers heading to California to San Diego . They are John Wayne and Don DeFore . Wayne and DeFore and Colbert soon form a threesome in going across country , and the film follows their adventures in Chicago , getting tossed off the train in in a small town on the plains , acquiring an antique automobile which takes them to New Mexico , getting involved with a family of Mexican immigrants ( which ends with them being chased away by the family head with a rifle ) , and finally reaching Albequerque . In the meantime Hall is going crazy as the delayed arrival of his star novelist is playing havoc with his well planned publicity campaign . ( Oddly enough , this particular casting pairing was never to appear in real life in any film of the careers of Turner and Grant . Turner never developed a semi-independent view of film selection that others in her lifetime ( including Grant , Kirk Douglas , Burt Lancaster , Elizabeth Taylor , and even Hedy Lamarr ) did . Turner seemed more willing to accept projects her studio handed to her . ) To add to the problems is that Colbert has found Wayne read her novel and did not care for it , and so she has disguised her identity from her . How long can she keep up this masquerade - and can she get Wayne to Hollywood to surprise him with a film test for the role . Also can she maintain his interest in her , which is difficult because Wayne's conservative nature ( which is eloquently expressed by Wayne in critiquing Colber's book ) is easily transferred to Colbert when she talks to him . She can become quite insistent on her point of view . It is not as odd a film as it seems . Wayne could co comedy ( John Ford frequently found small bits of business in his films for Wayne to kid around with ) . But here he is in the middle of a character comedy that manages to keep his own persona and political views up front . And it is not a strain when he talks of them . Also other bits of his personality come out . He is vamped by a Mexican woman who takes a fancy to him , and he returns the interest . Wayne , of course , liked Mexican people in general , and Mexican women in particular . His chemistry with Colbert is not as good as her chemistry with say Don Ameche or Ray Milland , but it is strong enough to work . In particular when she quietly uses various stratagems to help him and DeFore out ( like when she reveal her true identity to liquor store proprietor Erskine Sanford , in order to get several bottles of scotch when it is being rationed per bottle per customer ) . She is able to see that her views of her characters in the novel and the fate of mankind might not be as correct as she originally rigidly maintained . There are other nice bits in the film . Don DeFore had a good supporting part as Dink , Wayne's pal who is less intolerant about being lied to than Wayne is . By the way , this is one of the few times DeFore actually gets a chance to sing a little in a movie . Frank Puglia and his family make an interesting early example of a Mexican American family who seem fairly realistic for a change ( at least until Puglia believes he's been tricked ) . This film , ably directed by Mervyn LeRoy , is the only film that Colbert shared screen time with Cary Grant ( just about half a minute dancing ) . It was also the last film in Wayne's career where he had second place in the billing . On the whole then it is a reasonably good comedy of the limitations of abstract literary arguments between the sexes about the future ( which is what Colbert finally learns by the time the movie ends ) . Life is more than what we write in books - fortunately the lesson is not a costly one . And frequently it is presented in a funny manner here .
492647	3280905	39211	8.0	The Scoundrels We Barely Notice	I watched this last year on the Turner Network . When talking about film noir BORN TO KILL somehow manages to escape the notice of most film viewers who find meatier , better known titles ( THE BIG SLEEP , CROSSFIRE , DOUBLE INDEMNITY , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE , even DETOUR ) more worthy of discussion . Yet it is a film that touches upon the leveling forces of personality between classes . It also looks at how slender the difference is between respectability and sleaze . There are four characters in the film whom illustrate this : they are the stars , Lawrence Tierney , Claire Trevor , and Walter Slezak , and the supporting actress Esther Howard . Tierney is a sociopath , and a dark one at that . The slightest insult can turn him into your worst nightmare . At the start of the film , while Trevor is having a vacation in Las Vegas ( and staying in Howard's rooming house ) , Tierney finds his girl friend has two-timed him . He confronts the girl friend and her new lover in the rooming house and kills them both . He leaves , and Trevor , who was upstairs , comes down to find the dead bodies . But she decides not to get involved in the tragedy , so she packs and leaves , leaving the revelation of the crime in the hands of Howard . Now it turns out that Tierney has a history of violence prior to this : his closest acquaintance ( Elisha Cook Jr . ) convinces him to leave for California before the police show up to question him , and in convincing him mentions some bloody incidents in Tierney's past . Tierney heads for Los Angeles on the same train as Trevor . They meet , and click . Gradually Tierney forces his way into Trevor's world , but due to social problems ( for all her breeding she has no money ) Tierney looks for some quick cash solution to their eventual union . It turns upon his marrying her foster sister , a millionairess who owns a newspaper , and Trevor possibly marrying a millionaire shipyard owner . Trevor is not totally at ease with this , but her attraction to Tierney allows her to accept his marrying her foster-sister . She does worry about Tierney's decision ( one he really enjoys thinking about ) of taking over the management and editorial policy of his wife's newspaper . Howard ( in an interestingly complex role - she enjoys a good time , but she turns out to be extremely moralistic ) hires Walter Slezak as a detective to find out who killed her friend . Slezak is a highly intelligent detective , but corrupt . He discovers what Tierney did , and he also discovers that Trevor knows more than she admitted . So he ends up blackmailing them ( carefully though - he has no intention of being bumped off ) . When he confronts Trevor for a payoff , in his wonderfully silky way , Slezak gives the theme of the film . Smiling before he leaves Trevor's company , he says , " Truthfully , who would think that two respectable looking people like ourselves are such scoundrels ? " I will not reveal much more about the film , but it is a well made film noir , and deserves a bigger audience than it has gotten .
491664	3280905	120686	8.0	Worthy expansion and remake of " No Sad Songs For Me "	Sometimes a great star is able to make a final screen appearance that his or her fans realize is fitting their stature . Spencer Tracy did it with his final screen speech to Katherine Hepburn and the cast of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER about the lingering passions in his elderly frame towards the woman he actually did love . Paul Muni did it too in his last film , THE LAST ANGRY MAN , giving a performance as a true humanitarian doctor in his final days . Laird Cregar did it in those concluding , unforgettable shots of his mad musician in " Hell " in the burning conclusion of HANGOVER SQUARE . And Margaret O'Sullivan did it as the terminally ill mother and wife determined to have her family secured by a worthy second wife ( Vivica Lindfors ) in NO SAD SONGS FOR ME . O'Sullivan left a small output of films compared to her fellow female stars of the 1930s - 1940s , but they were mostly good performances in such films as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER , THE GOOD FAIRY , THREE COMRADES . and THE MORTAL STORM . She never won the Oscar , but she is recognized as one of the finest actresses of her age . The ultimate tragedy of her life - the emotional troubles that led to her suicide in 1960 - reinforce the sense of loss in her curtailed movie career as much as the death of James Dean does for him or the cancer that killed Judy Holliday a few years after O'Sullivan died . The film NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was remade in 1998 with a first rate cast and expanded . STEPMOM demonstrates how a remake can help redefine the characters of the original film and even make them more interesting . In NO SAD SONGS FOR ME , O'Sullivan moves silently for most of the film to manipulate husband Wendell Corey into seeing Lindfors as a worthy replacement for herself . But this is a little hard to believe ( though the acting of O'Sullivan makes it acceptable ) . Instead the remake forces Susan Sarandon ( in the O'Sullivan part ) to make 180 degree reversal for the sake of her ex-husband and kids . Instead of a placid household disrupted by on-coming tragedy , Sarandon's household is disrupted initially by her husband ( Ed Harris ) two-timing her with his new love Julia Roberts . Harris wants a divorce , and being a successful professional man he can give Sarandon a lot of money . But Sarandon is furious at the slap in her face and in the opening of the film she confronts both Harris and Roberts about their adultery . Her anger also spills over into resentment by her children ( Jena Malone and Liam Aiken ) who fully side with Mom . It is after the divorce that she learns the truth about her health problems . But there are methods of handling the cancer in 1998 unavailable to Margaret O'Sullivan in 1950 . Methods like chemotherapy . Sarandon ( who is determined to beat back her illness ) tries these methods , and leaves the scene to explore these treatments . Meanwhile Roberts finds she is trying to maintain her photography career and to somehow overcome the resentment of the two step-children . Now all this additional material enables the main thrust of the original story to make a trifle more sense . For after Sarandon finds all the treatments to be unworkable she returns to see what can be salvaged in her limited remaining time . This means making an alliance with the suspicious Roberts . . . one that eventually does soften into a close friendship as they both find each other's finer qualities . Not that Sarandon is really happy at what is going to happen to her . In one of the film's best scenes she vents to Roberts her total anger that she will not be alive to see her daughter get married . The venting actually helps break down the final walls between the two women . Slowly , as Harris , Malone , and Aiken become aware of the impending tragedy , the family unit expands to make room again for Sarandon as she makes sure she and her children spend as much time together as possible . And Roberts makes sure that Sarandon's intentions for the two children are carried out ( which enables her to finally win their trust and affections ) . The best moment in this section of the film is Roberts making sure that Malone is avenged against an obnoxious ex-boyfriend at her high school , where ( with Sarandon's approval ) Roberts uses a male model she knows and some special dialog ( regarding a disgusting sex act ) to humiliate the boy before his friends . NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was a great conclusion to a fine actress's screen career . STEPMOM was a first rate remake and expansion of that film enabling two of our finest current leading actresses to share the screen in two equally memorable parts .
492591	3280905	46054	8.0	The Curse of the Duries	It is generally conceded today that Robert Louis Stevenson's two greatest works are the unfinished novel WEIR OF HERMISTON , and the completed THE MASTER OF BALLENTRAE . The latter story ( published in 1889 ) is centered on a filial rivalry and hatred that lasts literally until the death of the two brothers involved . Ballentrae is an estate in 18th Century Scotland , and the chief heir is James Durie . On the surface he is an easy going , fun loving type . When the 1745 Jacobite revolt under Bonnie Prince Charlie occurs , the Laird of Ballentrae is in a quandary . As a Highland Laird , he has to show he is a supporter of the ancient royal house of Scotland ( the Stuarts ) that Prince Charles represents . As a man who knows what the Hanovarians are like , he dare not fully come out as a supporter . So he hedges his bets . He has James go off to fight for the Stuart cause , but keeps his younger son Henry at home . Henry is not a fun loving type - he is a quiet , business-like type , who does not make friends easily . So James goes off , and time passes . He is eventually reported as dead . Henry immediately becomes the heir to the estate . But suddenly James returns , and willingly brings troubles with him . The British government does have a price on his head , and if he is found on the estate the Duries may be imprisoned and their wealth taken away . Yet the old man insists that Henry do what is right for his older brother , and James keeps reminding Henry that by rights he is " Master of Ballentrae " . What happens , of course , is a disaster . To begin with , it slowly comes out that James may have declared for the Stuart cause , but he never showed up to fight for that cause . In short he acted like a loud mouth , attracting the anger of the government but then showed he was a coward . Not a total coward ( where his own interest is involved ) but one who won't put himself out for others when the chips are down . Secondly it turns out that his fun-loving activities are coming home to roost - he's had an affair , and left an illegitimate child . This , of course , means that the family has to support the bastard child . Moreover , Henry has married the woman who would have married James under normal circumstances . He is now trying to unofficially regain her attention . This proves too much for Henry , and leads to one of the best passages in Stevenson's writings - the duel between the brothers in a darkened room . It ends with Henry believing he killed James . Would that he had . James persecutes Henry and his wife for the rest of the novel ( the father eventually dies of shame after learning how James was so cowardly at Culloden ) . The novel eventually goes to New York ( then a colony ) where both brothers meet up and meet their joint destiny . This review of the story does not go into Henry's character flaws ( he is a money grubber in the end ) . Stevenson never did make a better completed novel , even though there are elements of the improbable in it . The story was made into this 1953 film , probably the last good movie Errol Flynn had the lead in that was a swashbuckler . The ambiguities and moral lapses of the two brothers are not used here ( Henry is played by Anthony Steel , and he is far too young here for the role ) . James ' opportunistic streak , and his non-appearance at Culloden is not in the film - he shows up at the battle . Indeed , he meets Colonel Francis Burke , an English Jacobite ( Roger Livesey ) who becomes his one ally and friend in the novel . In the film there will be other allies . Mervyn Johns plays the family servant MacKellar , who narrates the actual novel ( but not here ) , and sees the flaws of both brothers all too clearly ( although he ends up sympathizing with Henry ) . Lord Durrisdeer , the father of the brothers is Finlay Curray . The cast is generally quite good . But the excellence of the story is dropped and replaced into a tale of misunderstanding , and how a universal dislike of the English manages to keep the family together . Stevenson would have been amazed and hurt by what was done here . I am willing to give the film an " 8 " for it's good points , mostly the performances ( in particular Livesay's chemistry with Flynn ) . But I miss the tragic element of the novel . To properly appreciate the novel , if one can't read it , try to catch the television version made with Michael York and Richard Thomas and John Guilgud back in the 1980s . It too changed the end , but it stuck closer to the spirit of hopeless competition and hatred that Stevenson concocted in his masterpiece .
493434	3280905	105323	8.0	I don't know who went here - William Howard Taft , William Jennings Bryan , WilliamTell - It doesn't matter , Their spirit is dead here !	I will not try to determine what is the best film performance in Al Pacino's career , which included Donnie Brasso and Michael Corleone and Serpico . But his performance as Lt . Col . Frank Slade in SCENT OF A WOMAN must rank among his top ten performances . It was a surprise film performance that captured his second Oscar , and gave new impetus to his career . It is also an interesting view on the importance of character , and how it can be intentionally smashed by those supposed to be building it up . Chris O'Donnell is Charley Simms , a teenager on a scholarship to one of the most elite prep schools in America . He works in the library . One day he and another student are the last two locking up the library , and they see three students ( one is Bradley Whitford ) trashing an expensive new automobile belonging to the pompous and unlikeable new headmaster Mr . Trask ( James Rebhorn ) . Trask sees the activities and runs to his car , but the three boys scatter . He is pretty certain who they are , but he did not see them clearly . He does stop Charley and the other boy and demands to know what they saw . And here the problem begins that will mushroom until the film ends . Trask is a petty little snot-nose , and wants the heads of the three boys not so much because they did a wrong , but because they held him up to ridicule before the school body . Soon he is pressuring his two " witnesses " to cooperate , or face serious consequences ( expulsion and probable social ruin ) . The other boy , your typical rich kid party animal , is weak and under additional pressure from his father ( who'll ship him to the military if he does not knuckle under ) . Charlie is poor , and can be easily swatted , but Trask is willing that if Charlie cooperates there is nothing the school won't do for him when he heads for a high university career . It is Thanksgiving weekend , and Charley is not going home to Oregon . He sees that there is a blind officer who wants to go to New York City for the holiday , and needs an assistant . It is Lt . Col . Slade , and Charley goes to offer his services , only to find Slade a bitter and prickly man . He was once a promising military figure ( he was an aide to President Lyndon Johnson ) but he lost his eyesight in a stupid trick he was playing , and was retired from the military . Although he has a good pension he feels his life is in tatters . The two go to Manhattan , checking into a first rate hotel , and enjoying the sites ( as much as Slade can enjoy it , or Charley for that matter due to the crisis back at the school ) . But the two click , and Slade begins seeing in Charley the son that he would always have liked to have . Highlights of the trip include a wonderful moment when Charley and Slade ( who can pretend he can see ) test a magnificent convertible on a deserted twelfth avenue in Manhattan on Sunday morning with Slade driving while Charley keeps an eye on potential dangers . Slade also is still quite the lady's man , the title being a reference to his enhanced sense of smell of women's perfumes . In the end Slade learns what the situation is for Charley , who cannot depend on anyone to help him ( his father is long gone from his life , and his step-father could not care less about him ) . Slade ends up with Charlie at the conclusion - a hearing where Trask is going to break both his witnesses to get at the three guilty parties . And while the other boy somewhat caves in , Charley just can't bring himself to say anything . SPOILER COMING UP : Slade is the one who humiliates Trask . He announces that whatever Charley failed to do to satisfy the little headmaster he was not a snitch , and that the ideals of the school are dying in the hands of the headmaster who'd break the spirit of the boys there for his own pettiness . The quote in the Summary Line is part of Slade's speech , in answer to Trask commenting about the great men who came out of the prep school . What good of having these great men to talk of if the very character building blocks that are sought are demolished by the likes of Trask ? Slade points out to the students and teachers that if they leadership they should stick to Charley who won't snitch as opposed to the other fellow and the three idiots who caused the prank but lack the spirit to confess and face punishment . Slade's speech does the trick , and Charley is not punished . In the end one senses the two men will remain close . It seems right that they should . Oh , I kept referring to the other witness without telling who he is . It was a surprise when I watched the film recently . The character , George Wills Jr . , is a party animal type - not really bright and his father has paved his way in with money and donations . I knew someone like that in my college - he was a nice guy but a heavy drinker . He died prematurely ( before his own father ) in 1989 , from the results of his heavy drinking . The character of George Wills , Jr . , helpless in the hands of his dad and Trask ( though he tries to limit the damage of his " testimony " ) was played by the young Philip Seymour Hoffman . It's interesting to see a budding personality of the screen in an early performance of promise . Within fifteen years Hoffman too would have his best acting Oscar . As for my old college acquaintance , this is dedicated to the unfortunate Donald .
492962	3280905	39583	8.0	Another superb novella of Henry James	The basis of this movie is a Henry James novella entitled THE ASPERN PAPERS . In the story , the narrator is a publisher who is trying to find a trove of love letters that were supposedly written by one of early 19th Century America's great romantic poets , Jeffrey Aspern . His search takes him to Venice , where he ingratiates himself into the household of Aspern's still living lover and her niece . He succeeds better than he expects , because the letters do exist - but to get to them he has to be nicer and nicer to the niece . Eventually he does read some of the letters , but his success is cut short - the niece is expecting the publisher is in love with her , and will marry her . This was not planned , and ( reluctantly ) he gives up his search . Then , a few years later , he returns after the aunt has died . The niece is still there , but realizing why he had been so interested in her she decided on her revenge ( reminiscent , in it's way , to the the revenge of Catherine Sloper to Morris Townsend . in THE HEIRESS / " Washington Square " ) . She tells she burned all the letters . End of story . The movie expands the part of the aunt ( Agnes Moorehead ) , making her the keeper of a grave secret . Susan Hayward properly shows the emotional problems of an attractive woman facing spinsterhood . And Bob Cummings is able to show that , for all his business interest in the literary find , he is not without a human side . Oddly enough the story was based on a true one , that is discussed by Professor Richard Altick's classic book THE SCHOLAR ADVENTURERS . The actual incident involved a cache of love and private letters of George , Lord Byron . Regretfully , they too were burned .
491972	3280905	121982	8.0	The Mountain out of a Molehill Caper .	Walt Disney usually had good production standards , talented performers , and good production groups ( directors , etc . ) . In the last year of the Mickey Mouse Club he had this 19 week serial centered around his most attractive and talented Mousequetier , Annette Funicello . She plays a newly orphaned girl who moves in to the home of a wealthy aunt and uncle , and tries to adjust to a new town . But she has lived on a farm , so the clique of rich kids at the top of the school are likely to look down at her . In particular , the typical " rich bitch " character Roberta Shore ( as Laura Rogan ) , who dislikes Annette as a basically decent person who is her rival . There was music and nice settings in the episodes , such as a hay ride where ( I believe ) Annette sang a tune I recall , " How do I know my love ? How do I know my darling ? " . The real crux of the conflict occurs when Annette is invited to a party at Shore's home and the latter's necklace vanishes . Shore of course jumps to the conclusion that Annette took it , which she finally denounces as untrue . It was in the middle of the series of episodes , and only at the tail end did it blow up in Shore's face . SPOILER : The kids ( including Annette and Shore ) had been around the grand piano in the mansion's living room . Shore took her necklace off to basically wave it in the face of Annette . But she puts it down poorly and it falls into the piano . Now about five months pass with the necklace lost , but although Shore claims they looked apparently nobody looked in the piano . So when in the last episode someone playing the piano finds it sounds out of tune , and discovers the necklace was in the harp , they naturally think Shore knew and lied . It smashes her reputation . Still I do remember the show and series . It was fine for kids from 5 to 11 .
493106	3280905	53054	8.0	Sex , the farm , and the I . R . S . tax code	I have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the U . S . Government's yearly demand for taxes . Ever read a tax code ? : it is quite a trial to follow it's multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups . Despite claims that it is fair , the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential . Most of the various special clauses are meant for their use - go through the average 1040 or 1040A form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules . Most people will never have any use for these . The story here is that a wealthy landowner ( Philip Ober ) uses his influence to tip off the IRS that his neighbors ( Paul Douglas and Una Merkle ) have not payed taxes in 20 years . The Baltimore office of the IRS is under Fred Clarke , and he is snapping to attention for Ober with his influence . He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation . Randall finds that Douglas , Merkle , and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people , who rarely have need for cash ( they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors ) . But Randall , trained in the clear ( to the IRS ) lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals . But gradually Douglas notes that Reynolds is fond of Randall , and he keeps sidetracking Randall from his chore , eventually getting him drunk . He also makes it difficult for Randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed " for repairs " by his two sons . The plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban , vaguely ambitious Randall , and countryside , life loving Reynolds . They make a cute couple actually . Eventually , after Ober complains , Randall is sent back in disgrace and Clarke ( a tougher cookie ) gets down to brass tacks . And comes up with a very large tax bill , that will possibly ruin Douglas's family . The film does not end there - it does end happily , but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy , and that the Government does , all too frequently , go in for destruction . A chance in a million reversal saves the family , but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick . More realistic is how Clarke's boss , ( Charles Lane ) cuts to the essence regarding Ober's " help " by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully . After that Ober is rather green .
492776	3280905	50985	8.0	David v . Goliath in Sloughsborough	For people who think only of Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as the " parents " of Elsa the Lioness in BORN FREE , watching them in this film shows they were more versatile than the better known movie suggested . Both were trained actors , and could handle comedy ( they could also handle the classics : try to find a kine-scope of their television version of James Barrie's THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON ) . Here they have inherited a flea bag of an old movie house , which they would gladly sell if they could get a decent amount for it . But the town of Sloughsborough has a nicer , more modern movie house owned by Francis De Wolfe , and while he would buy out the flea bag it seems to him to be a buyer's market : so his offer for the flea bag is ( at best ) modest . There is a staff to the flea bag : Margaret Rutherford , Bernard Miles , and Peter Sellers . They are all made up to look like they are about sixty to seventy . Sellers at this time was showing that ( as Alec Guiness had done a little earlier ) he was a master not so much of disguise but of finding the different personalities that went along with those disguises . Every film he showed up in from 1955 to 1964 in England showed a different person involved . Altogether they gave him a film following that has not dissipated a quarter century after his death . Sellers nervous little Mr . Quill , with his " Crippen " style mustache and glasses , has one major weakness - one that De Wolfe uses to almost destroy the flea bag movie house . But even better is Miles ' quietly cagey " Old Tom " ( no last name given ) . He seems to be an elderly relic , but he does show surprising enterprise at the end - with somewhat shocking results . His physical appearance , with shaggy mustache and bald head , bears comparison and amazement to his physical appearance in say THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH ( 1956 ) or NICHOLAS NICKLEBY . It's hard to believe it's the same actor . Of the three Rutherford looks the least changed by the make-up . Her performance is also the least colorful , but she adds a quiet grace to the running of the flea bag movie house - a reminder of earlier days . The best moments of the film are when Travers and Co . slowly find ways of making the flea bag pay : they discover the power of heat and the movies they show , emphasizing deserts . Then - intermission - and the sale of drinks and snacks . It does allow them to make a slight profit - but in their conflict with " Goliath " De Wolfe , any profit is a major victory .
492172	3280905	37595	8.0	A Nice Seasonal Comedy , and Sidney Greenstreet finally gets a good comic role	Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s ( Casper Gutman , Signior Ferrari , Mr . Peters , Jerome K . Arbutny , Ex-Superintendent Grodman , Count Fosco , Titus Semple ) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway . He was usually such a total villain , or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored . In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances ( one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance ) . His best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in " Christmas In Connecticut " ( although his autocratic , half-mad soap tycoon in " The Hucksters " is a close second ) . Despite some problems with the screenplay , it is a good film , and usually revived in the Christmas season . Elizabeth Lane ( Barbara Stanwyck ) writes a column in " American Housekeeping " magazine for Yardley , where she gives household tips and cooking recipes . She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward , except that Ms Steward is a cook and house-owner , and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates . Stanwyck can't . Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix ( S . Z . Sakall ) , a gourmet chef and restaurateur . The house she describes as her home ( a model farmhouse in Connecticut ) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend , architect John Sloan ( Reginald Gardiner ) . Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck , but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him . As the film begins , an American is shipwrecked by the Nazis . This is Jefferson Jones ( Dennis Morgan ) , a sailor . He spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued . Sensing publicity value , Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned Christmas in Connecticut . He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays . Stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself ( complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks , and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband ) is a lie - if she does she will be fired , as will her immediate boss Dudley Beecham ( Robert Shayne ) . In a moment of depression she accepts Gardiner's proposal of marriage , and then Gardiner finds his Connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the " actual " home of Stanwyck and himself and " their baby " . Of course , aside from putting off Greenstreet's meddling curiosity , Stanwyck and Morgan find that they are falling in love ( much to the annoyance of Gardiner - he does actually expect that Stanwyck will still marry him ) . Complication following complication occurs , as lies piles on lies , and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies , before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something . But it is a comedy , so everything works out well . Even Greenstreet , at the conclusion , is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of Santa Clause for a change . This is not a classic comedy , certainly not a great one , but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in December .
492077	3280905	45187	8.0	Our First Great Composer ?	John Philip Sousa's position in American ( and World ) music is set in stone by now . Others have composed great marches ( the English composer Edward Elgar with his four " Pomp and Circumstance Marches " for instance , two of which are memorable ) , and such major composers like Wagner and Mendelsohn . But Sousa remains the " March King " . Like Johann Strauss the Younger , Alexander Scarlatti , and Scott Joplin , he is recalled for his domination of a single area of music : marches in this case , rather than waltzes , sonatas , or " rags " . But this really does not explain why he remains the " March King " . There is a sense of fun and spirit in Sousa's marches that transcend what a march is usually supposed to do . Marches were originally meant for troops to walk in step either on a training field or on the battlefield ( music was used until the end of the 19th Century to keep up the spirits of the soldiers , and even to help orchestrate the speed they were to fight at when running across the battlefield ) . Sousa came from a musical family ( his father was a musician in the Marine Corps band ) . Sousa followed in his father's footsteps , but played several instruments and rose to be the bandmaster . He began composing pieces for the Marine Corps Band , such as " Semper Fidelis " , " The Washington Post March " , " Manhattan Beach " , and he tried to expand his abilities into other fields . When he left the Marine Corps , he formed his own band , which he developed with a perfect balance of brass , stings , percussion , and woodwinds . His band would go around the world performing , not only his own pieces , but also other composers as well . The movie does touch , once or twice , on Sousa's attempts to broaden his musical ability by doing Broadway shows ( operettas ) . At the start Clifton Webb , as Sousa , does play the melody of " Semper Fidelis " for his wife Jenny ( Ruth Hussey ) as a tune to be sung . It doesn't quite work . He would do a successful operetta ( which is still revived ) called EL CAPITAN , which starred DeWolf Hopper ( we hear an actor as Hopper singing a tune at a rehearsal during the movie ) . However , EL CAPITAN had a book by Charles Klein , a major dramatist of the 1890s - 1915 ( he drowned in the Lusitania disaster ) . Klein was not a W . S . Gilbert , but his libretto was serviceable . Unfortunately Sousa never had another librettist / lyricist like Klein , and spent the rest of his career seeking his " Gilbert " . As a result the leading operetta composer from the U . S . in Sousa's lifetime ( and since ) was Victor Herbert . Sousa was talented in other ways too . He sometimes wrote clever lyrics to comic songs , such as " A Typical Song of Zanzibar " . He wrote about five comic novels too . He designed the special marching tuba , the " Sousaphone " ( which is shown in the film being designed by Webb and Robert Wagner ) . But it is the string of great marches that he left which are his great donation to our culture . The reason is more than just his gift for melodious music . He was a genius at composition and orchestration - probably the best orchestrator among the major American composers . His best remembered march is the title march for this film : THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER . The film mentions how Sousa , on a trip for his health , was walking the deck of the liner at night and thought of the beat of the music . We hear Webb describing the moment ( quoting a passage from Sousa's memoirs , MARCHING ALONG ) , and the film ends with the playing of the great march . The film does not mention that that Sousa also composed words to be sung to it ( which occasionally still are sung ) . A few years ago , the U . S . Congress formally adopted THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER as the national march . I have gone into a great deal of detail regarding Sousa and his career , for the movie ( for a biography ) skims a lot . His literary efforts are not dealt with , and the film ends ( really ) with the playing of THE STARS AND STRIPE FOREVER . That was in 1899 . Sousa would live until 1932 , and would be a public figure until then . He was still composing until the 1920s . Webb had an extensive musical comedy career in the 1920s and 1930s ( he was one of the stars in Irving Berlin's AS THOUSANDS CHEER , for example ) . But aside from an occasional tune he sings like " When I wore a Tulip " or a dance he does with Jeanne Craig in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN , he never did a musical . STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER is his one " musical film " . He is credible as Sousa , but the film never really goes deeply into the great man . The dramatic portions are handled by Robert Wagner and Deborah Paget as friends and lovers , whose love affair is twisted for awhile by the Spanish American War . The film is certainly watchable ( the cast is game , and the music is first rate ) but it is not a showcase for Webb's talents in musicals . Ironically he could have been in Vincent Minelli's THE BANDWAGON with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse , but opted for the lead as Sousa . Probably a bad decision - but it is hard to say . Every July 4th STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER is shown for it's great holiday music . What we lost in not seeing Webb opposite Astaire is not enough to prevent our still seeing Webb as the great maestro composer .
493407	3280905	26097	8.0	San Francisco's Experiment With Vigilantes ( 1851 - 1856 )	In 1848 the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican - American War , with the secession of territory from Mexico to the U . S . of most of the current southwestern U . S . ( California , Arizona , New Mexico , any claims to Texas - as well as parts of Colorado , Utah , and Nevada ) . This was a war of conquest by the U . S . , but to assuage American consciences fifteen million dollars was paid to Mexico for this territory . Only a subsequent bit of southern Arizona and New Mexico ( known as the " Gadsden Purchase " ) was made as an addition in 1853 by the Pierce Administration , giving us the current southwestern border . While the territory of Northern California ( as opposed to the territory of Baja or Southern California - still part of Mexico ) had always been a bit too far from Mexico City for proper control over local government , the change to Washington , D . C . - more than twice the distance and across a continent - further seemed to weaken national control of the territory . Moreover the population , being mostly Latino , was hostile to the non-Latino U . S . Government . It is in the next few years that California's so-called answer to Robin Hood , Joachin Murrieta , is continuing the Mexican War by his guerrilla / bandit attacks . Under normal circumstances , it would have taken a generation for the U . S . to be really bothered by this . But in 1849 gold was discovered in California , and the world rushed in . Suddenly the territory had nearly one million population within a year , and demanded statehood . This would lead to the controversy about admitting California to the Union as an free state , and unbalancing the balance of the U . S . Senate . This in turn led to the Compromise of 1850 which enabled California to enter the Union as a free state , but guaranteed a fugitive slave act as a sop to the South . It put off the Civil War ( or ignited the path to the Civil War ) ten years later . But for a big state , with wealth and population and size , California had a bad reputation . The towns of San Francisco and Los Angeles boomed in population - in particular San Francisco with it's immense harbor . But their governments were pitifully unable to maintain public order . Fires ( arson caused ) were frequent . So were killings , usually tied to robberies of the prospectors with more gold than sense . Judges and police were frequently paid off by gamblers and crime gang leaders . Finally , in 1851 , the better elements of San Francisco put their foot down and formed a vigilante committee . They arrested several dubious characters , held stream-lined trials ( where many legal niceties were ditched ) and if the parties were found guilty ( which usually happened ) they were hanged in public . It sort of calmed things down , but then the continued prosperity of the state caused the same problems to reappear . In 1856 two incidents reignited the Vigilante Committee . First a local outspoken newspaper editor , James King of William , was shot and killed by a corrupt local political alderman named James Carey . Then a gambler named Charles Cora shot and killed a police official . Both men were arrested , given the drum-head trial , convicted , and hanged . The Vigilantes retained control of San Francisco for the rest of the next year before disbanding . They never had to make a third appearance . Were they real heroes or a lynch mob ? It still is debated . James King of William was right about the corruption and crime , but he was a " Nativist " , and his attacks were also against Catholics , such as Carey ( an Irish American ) and Cora ( an Italian American ) . Many of his fellows were also Protestants , and some may have had pecuniary interests in attacking the businesses controlled by the Catholics . So the real situation is not black and white , like this film suggests . Edward G . Robinson's Luis Chamalis was based on Charles Cora , although the triangle with Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrae is from whole cloth . Col . Marcus Cobb ( Frank Craven ) is based on James King of William ( although King of William was never reduced to such stunning superficiality as Cobb is for nearly a year ) . Robinson's grip on the whole of San Francisco is fictitious ( Cora never had that much power ) . The leadership of the Vigilantes ( Harry Carey ) reflect the moral center of the Vigilantes movement that was unquestioned in American History books of the 1935 . It is a good film , with fine performances by Robinson , Hopkins , Craven , Brian Donleavy ( who's physical appearance makes him look like the corrupt contemporary Mayor of New York City , Fernando Wood ) , and Brennan . McCrae is sturdy and acts well , but his role seems terribly naive . It is fun trying to locate David Niven as a drunken cockney sailor tossed out of Robinson's saloon ( he recalled it fondly in THE MOON'S A BALLOON ) . Robinson's recollections of the film were downers in ALL MY YESTERDAYS : he had political disputes about the on-coming World War II with isolationists Hopkins , Carey , Craven , Brennan , McCrae , and director Hawks . Hopkins kept trying to upstage him and the others , until he let her have it before the cast and crew ( who applauded him for it ) . He also felt the end was a let down . Quietly told by Carey and his associates it is time to accompany them to his neck stretching party , he quietly joins them , as though they have come to take him to deliver a political speech ! Still the film merits an " 8 " out of " 10 " .
492308	3280905	37823	8.0	Everything but the kitchen sink !	It's a pity that some of the one time classic works of popular culture are now dusty and distant to most of us . This is particularly true of that remarkable medium of radio . Radio had an impact from 1920 to 1960 , when it was replaced by television . Television assaulted radio with it's versions of talk shows and game shows . It was one thing to hear that Mr . X won a new car , but quite more effective to see Mr . X looking at a new Buick or Rambler or Oldsmobile . It was more interesting watching Edward R . Murrow on Person to Person with a celebrity than just listening to them talk ( in one case Murrow did one interview that was impossible on radio - he interviewed Harpo Marx ) . There was just one area that radio beat out television . By relying on voices only , radio stimulated the imagination of the audience . It was very effective in comedy shows . Jack Benny would say he had to get some money , and the sound effects would create ( in the listener's minds ) the fabled Benny vault , which was further down than Fort Knox's and guarded by a Civil War veteran . Fred Allen would go outside down Allen's Ally , and interview a cross section of the American public every week , including a relic of New England , a voice of the deep south , and a Jewish lady who constantly mangled English and managed to make her family's triumphs and travails part of the issue . Allen is sadly forgotten today - you can get recordings of his show on tape , but the references deal with the political / social world of the 1940s and 1950s . This is the fate of all topical humor . Just wait four decades and play that hysterical list joke by David Letterman or opening monologue by Jay Leno to some teenagers . See how quickly they get bored and ask you " Did you really find this funny ? " Allen was sharp in his comments - the most remembered is his reference to the size of a heart of a Hollywood agent ( which was smaller than an olive pit ) . He would be able to skirt censors pretty well . In one sketch he talked of a new sponsor - a watch manufacturer named Fuller Bullova . With his normal group of second bananas Allen would satirize the politics of the period , or the social figures of the day ( Dawson Bells , a prominent actor / producer , describing his latest movie says , " The street is a symbol , the music is a symbol , the drums are a symbol , the cymbal is a symbol ! " ) . Allen wrote his own material , and wrote very well . If he is remembered it is for the fake feud he had with his friend Jack Benny . Apparently it began when he pretended that Benny had not been funny at all . Benny laughed , called Allen up and asked if he could zing some back at him . Allen was smart enough to say yes - and the feud became famous in radio lore . It also got into their films , where Allen and Benny would confront each other ( most notably in the whole film LOVE THY NEIGHBOR ) . In this film , there is only one scene of Benny with Allen and it is a different type of joke . Whereas the two are clashing in LOVE THY NEIGHBOR , in IT'S IN THE BAG it is a scene where a desperate Allen goes to try to re-buy a chair from Benny , who is all to happy to sell it back - he sells everything as either a souvenir of your visit or a refreshment ( including water ) . Allen , to see Benny , has to pretend he's a fan , and asks him the secret of his success , and Benny explains that the basis is his timing - he is constantly delaying audience reaction ( which should be hostile ) by slowly reacting as he thinks about what he said and wonders what it means . IT'S IN THE BAG shows Allen at his best , because it is not shared with Benny as LOVE THY NEIGHBOR , or shared with Jimmy Durante in SALLY , IRENE , AND MARY . He is in the center , trying to reclaim a stolen or missing fortune ( hidden in a chair ) . To do this requires him dealing with his wife Binnie Barnes , with his daughter's potential father-in-law Robert Benchley , with crooked lawyers John Carridine and John Miljan , and with hostile police detective Sidney Toler ( his second best comic performance after THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT ) . He also crosses paths with an insane ( and insatiably hungry ) psychiatrist ( Jerry Colonna ) , and a gang boss who would like to go straight , but inherited his gang from his mother , Machine Gun Molly . The gang boss is William Bendix . Allen's humor is in his sharp reactions to everyone around him . My favorite moment is when he and Binnie go out to a nightclub , to hear the doorman say , " Plenty of room folks ! Always plenty of room ! " There is no more room . Later that same night thy go to the movies only to find the same idiot using the same spiel to bring more people into the theater . They do find seats in something like the twelfth level of balconies . In disgust at his poor seats ( they can barely see a screen ) , Allen goes out to find the manager ( Emory Parnell ) . He complains about the witless idiot bringing people in when there are no decent seats . Parnell is upset , until he hears who was responsible . " Oh that's Joe , " he says while he laughing , " Good old Joe , ever the optimist ! " This is his sole explanation of what happened . The film is resolved happily , with most of the people involved showing up at a party at the Floogles . As he watches them arriving , Allan shakes his head and says , " Everything but the kitchen sink . " A moment later one of them lowers a kitchen sink . Perfect ending to a laugh fest .
492161	3280905	514530	8.0	This Was The Episode Where We Wondered About Mr . Humphreys	In the 8th Season of ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? there were a number of cast changes , such as two actors taking over the senior salesman slot in haberdashery , a new junior salesman ( Kenneth Berry ) and a new Mr . Grace ( Kenneth Waller ) . Into this flux there were occasions when the episodes of the long - running comedy hit seemed to be flaying . One of the flaying episodes was this unexpected little beauty . For the key to this episode was the conclusion that opened the issue : Wilberforce Clayborne Humphries - was he gay or straight or what ? The late John Inman is possibly the comic performer most people recall from ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? This is not to knock Mollie Sugden's " Mrs . Slocombe " , Frank Thornton's " Captain Stephen Peacock " , Wendy Richards ' " Ms Shirley Braham " , Nicholas Smith's " Mr . Cuthbert Rumbolt " , or Arthur English's " Beverley Harman " . The ensemble was always first rate ( as were the previous actors like Trevor Bannister and Arthur Borough who were on it as well ) . But Inman's friendly and fey Mr . Humphries was like a hose of light laughing gas every time he spoke or moved . He certainly is missed since his passing last year . ( Again , the performer's name is misspelled on this website's thread . It is spelled as " B " , " R " , " O " , " U " , " G " , " H " . Why it keeps popping up as " Borough " is anyone's guess . ) It is generally assumed , due to his description of his social life ( frequently in situations like playing strip poker with sailors ) that Humphries is a happy homosexual man . It is only in THE EROTIC DREAMS OF MRS . SLOCOMBE that we finally question this issue . Mrs . Slocombe has been hitting the bottle more frequently than ever . She confides to Ms Brahms that she's been having a series of erotic dreams about Humphries . When Captain Peacock presses Brahms about Slocombe's behavior she tells him . In the haberdashery counter Humphries , " Bert Spooner " ( Mr . Berry ) , and " Mr . Klein " ( Benny Lee ) , are aware of her interest too ( she has been purchasing items like gloves for him there ) . Humphries has tried to ignore it , but finds that by force of her personality he can't . The floor was in a store-wide raffle for some tickets to the ballet at Covent Garden . The floor has won , and with the consultation of Mr . Grace and Mr . Rumbolt the members of the two departments and Captain Peacock go to the ballet . But secretly , having read a psychiatrist report on Mrs . Slocombe , they find that the only way to possibly end her persecution of Mr . Humphries is for Mrs . Humphries to take the initiative and show a wild sexual urge to Mrs . Slocombe . It may shock her into normality . There are many good moments in the show , dealing with the secret drinking of Mrs . Slocombe ( that is not very secret ) . If Ray Milland hid bottles in chandeliers , Mrs . Slocombe hides gin in manikin sections . A drinking test she is asked to take takes to the air , so to speak . And the final ballet sequence is very funny . SPOILER COMING UP : It is this episode that Humphries ' homosexual reputation is finally questioned a bit . He had ( two years earlier ) pretended to be a groom for Mrs . Slocombe at a Greek wedding , but it was not a real Greek wedding . Here he is at sea about how to play sex games with Mrs . Slocombe ( who is progressively getting sleepier and sleepier ) , and has to ask Ms Brahms . And Ms Brahms , in showing how to manipulate a man into a sexual mood unleashes a hitherto unexpected tiger . So again , was he or wasn't he ? Maybe he was bi-sexual .
492050	3280905	514543	8.0	Mrs . Slocombe's brief rise in the world	In many of the episodes of ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? the issue of sexism comes up . Usually Mrs . Slocombe ( Mollie Sugden ) and Miss Brahams ( Wendy Richards ) find that the men bind together in a kind of chauvinist club against them when they present fairly reasonable requests . In this episode Mr . Mash ( Larry Martyn ) brings some supplies to the ladies ' department , including ladies ' panties that have sexually suggestive phrases or illustrations ( like shadows of hands on the parts over the behind ) on them . Mrs . Slocombe and Miss Brahams both feel these are demeaning and Slocombe tells Captain Peacock ( Frank Thornton ) that she has no intention of selling them . Peacock reminds her that she is obliged to sell what the purchase department has bought for her department as merchandise . Slocombe still refuses and does so again when Mr . Rumbold ( Nicholas Smith ) also confronts her . She has no intention to resign ( although she says to Miss Brahams she came close to doing so ) , but attempts to defend her position . She finds not only Peacock and Rumbold hostile , but so are Mr . Grainger ( Arthur Borough ) , who feels that she has been a pest ever since she was moved to what had been his floor , and with Mr . Humphrey ( John Inman ) and Mr . Lucas ( Trevor Bannister ) agreeing that if they removed Slocombe's ladies ' department the men's wear department could expand back to what it was . So except for Miss Brahams nobody is supporting Mrs . Slocombe . But suddenly Young Mr . Grace ( Harold Bennett ) appears and requests that Mrs . Slocombe see him later in the afternoon . He announces that he is planning on remarrying . Naturally the men on the floor now see Mrs . Slocombe as about to be married to the owner of the department store , and thus their boss . Everyone who had previously been harshly rejecting her ideas suddenly does a 180 degree reversal , insisting that she is right about everything . They bend over backwards in helping her get ready for her meeting with Mr . Grace . Grainger even allows her to use his department's dressing room , although when she does use it she finds it being occupied by a man being fitted for a new pair of pants . Other events are going on in the episode , including how Mr . Lucas and Mr . Humphrey sell a sweater to a customer ( John Clegg ) who manages to get his wig lost in pulling off the sweater . In the end Mrs . Slocombe's bubble of success and social position is burst as a false dream . But in the closing moments of the show she is able to use her failure to gain a bit of satisfaction and success at the expense of the boot-licking males on the floor . And she also gives advise to Mr . Grace regarding his plans as well .
492843	3280905	41107	8.0	Mr . Milland's Longevity	Ray Milland managed to do something that few critics were ever willing to admire him for . He was a good looking man of Welsh ( not English ) ancestry , who could play members of the English upper class . But he was always willing to stretch a bit more than other similar actors . For one thing , he could play villains . Even in his early career he was frequently cast as a weakling or a gigolo ( as in " We're Not Dressing " ) . He was willing to experiment with comic roles as well as straight drama . The result was that from 1942 to 1951 or so Milland was a Hollywood star . He played the leads in films as various as " Reap the Wild Wind " , " The Major and the Minor " , " The Ministry of Fear " , " The Big Clock " , " The Lost Weekend " , " Golden Earings " , and " Alias Nick Beal " . While some of his films were comedies ( such as " The Major and the Minor " and " Skylark " ) quite a number were dramas or even melodramas . And some of his characters skirt the edge of acceptable behavior . He is a man who has just been released for committing a mercy killing of his wife in " The Ministry of Fear " . Although he is basically innocent , he is a flirtatious type in " The Big Clock " . Even in Wilder's " The Major and The Minor " there is a moment when Milland , smiling at the thought of what a real " knockout " " Sue-sue Applegate " ( actually grown-up Ginger Rogers ) is , suddenly gets a really pained look in his face - he does not like that he's thinking lascivious thoughts about a child . His deserved " Oscar " for " The Lost Weekend " is another example of this dark side - he is supposed to be a writer , but he is a poseur with a serious drinking problem . In fact , he contemplates suicide at the conclusion of the film , only to be stopped by Jane Wyman . In " Alias Nick Beal " he played his most sinister part ( except possibly Tony Wendice in " Dial " M " For Murder " ) . Here he played Satan , and he is in total control of the game throughout of the movie - the game being politics and power over people . On one level , if one forgets the supernatural elements , " Alias Nick Beal " is as good an abject lesson in the back room deals of American politics as the comedies " The Senator Was Indiscreet " or Preston Sturges ' " The Great McGinty " . Only here , with violent death thrown in , the seediness of it all becomes more apparent . Possibly the best moment is when the honest , and mostly honorable , Thomas Mitchell is forced to shake hands with Fred Clark , the most notorious political boss in the state . On the other level is the serious attempt to keep some religious allegory in , with people like George Macready ( here in a rare good guy part ) noting that Beal resembles an ancient picture of the Devil , and that " Los islas de las almas perditas " where Beal comes from means , " The Island of Lost Souls " . Religion does play a crucial role in the film , including it's completion . Leslie Halliwell made the observation that after this film none of the stars ever did as well again . This is not true . Milland did play the evil Tony Wendice , and Macready went on to the mad French general in " Paths of Glory " . But more important , Milland kept showing his ability to stretch in the remaining decades of his life . Besides writing his interesting autobiography " Wide Eyed in Babylon " , he directed several films , he appeared in several televisions series ( one of the few stars who did not fear the new medium - and he was rewarded here too , for in the 1970s and 1980s he was still appearing while many contemporaries retired ) . Finally he capped his career as the snobbish father in " Love Story " . Actually his career is an example of just what can be accomplished if a person is not ashamed to jettison useless or outdated personalities for new ones .
492730	3280905	36348	8.0	" Who Had It ? . . . . "	Although it seems a little long , at times , SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH is one of the best of the modern Holmes stories starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce . The plot for a change actually is twisty enough for one to wonder who is the killer . The revelation is a bit more of a surprise than many of the other stories . The basis for this film is " THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL " , which is similar in some details but has been expanded . The story , actually one of two that Holmes has to relate to Watson because it occurred before they met , is how Holmes is visiting the home of a school chum , Reginald Musgrave , and how the family butler , one Brunton , disappears after he is caught in the act of apparently looking over old family documents . Musgrave discharged Brunton , but then the butler vanished . It is believed he has fled because he has become entangled with a local girl , who has also disappeared . The story was properly filmed ( although with some slight changes ) in the BBC " Mystery " series of Holmes stories with Jeremy Brett . I will not tell the clever ending , but it deals with the titled " Ritual " which the Musgrave family has been reciting since the middle of the 17th Century , which begins : " Who had it ? He who is gone . Who shall have it ? He who will come . " If one thinks about the ritual wording one can help figure out the mystery of the story . Interestingly , the wording attracted a literary figure of higher importance than Conan Doyle in modern times - T . S . Elliot . Always having a fine ear for English speech and diction , Elliot was so impressed with the first four lines of the Ritual , he transposed them into a section of his verse drama about Thomas a'Beckett , MURDER IN THE CATHEDRAL . Elliot was very fond of Conan Doyle's stories , and one of his poems in OLD POSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATS ( the source of the musical CATS ) is " MACAVITY THE MYSTERY CAT " which is based on details about Professor Moriarty . The actual ritual is used in the film , although it is expanded into a type of chess game . The story is changed ( modernized to fit the war effort ) . Watson is working at a rest home for soldiers suffering stress and battle fatigue . The home is the estate house of Geoffrey Musgrave , his brother Philip , and his sister Sally ( Frederick Warlock , Gavin Muir , and Hillary Brooke ) . One day Watson's assistant Dr . Bob Sexton ( Arthur Margetson ) stumbles in wounded and says he was attacked from behind and stabbed in the neck . The perpetrator is assumed to be one of the serviceman . Watson tells Holmes about it , so Holmes comes down to take a look . Then a murder occurs , and Inspector Lestrade ( Dennis Hoey , as good as ever ) pops up . The chief suspect is the American officer Captain Vickery ( Milburn Stone - not given too much to do in this film , unfortunately ) , who has been romancing Brooke . I will leave it at that , except to say that the secret of the Ritual is expanded from a piece of jewelry to something of considerable more value . Despite some slightly long stretches , it is a good , twisty plot and well worth the watching .
493022	3280905	45030	8.0	A Good Adaptation	Although he wrote " Sketches By Boz " ( hence his lifelong nickname ) before this novel , " Pickwick Papers " was the work which grounded Dickens reputation . His third book " Oliver Twist " cemented it - by showing him a perceptive social critic and serious ( rather than comic ) novelist . George Orwell , in his essay on Charles Dickens , says that many people regretted he never could have continued writing the pure comic novels like " Pickwick " , but Orwell pointed out that no serious novelist can do that if they wish to show growth . It's true , although some ( P . G . Wodehouse , for example ) could continue to turn out successfully funny books all the time . But we would have missed " David Copperfield " , " A Tale of Two Cities " , and " Great Expectations " if Dickens just remained a funny writer . " Pickwick " is about 850 pages long , and has a shaggy dog construction . Dickens wrote a picaresque novel here , with the Pickwick Club members exploring England , and falling into many misadventures . They are supposed to be sending papers back to their club about their adventures , for they are a learned society . In one great moment in the novel ( but not in the movie , unfortunately ) , they think they find a curiosity - a stone with the words " Bilst umpshi mark + ) . Their paper on this gains them immense public adulation for their scholarship , but one critic ( who is kicked out of the Pickwick Club ) investigates and says it should say " Bill Stumps , his mark " + " . Nobody cares about the nay-sayer . One aspect of the novel that is not in the film was Dickens addition of about seven or eight short stories the group hears or reads while on their tours . Dickens wanted to vary his novel , and he would do this again in " Nicholas Nickleby " briefly at the start of that novel . In 1841 Dickens began a large scale literary project called " Master Humphrey's Clock " in which Master Humphrey and his friends ( including Samuel Pickwick , Sam Weller , and Tony Weller ) tell stories , but two of the stories expanded into full scale novels : " The Old Curiosity Shop " and " Barnaby Rudge " . After " Master Humphrey's Clock " Dickens never again wrote a book of just short stories ( his " Christmas Novels " were not written and published together but over the years ) . An occasional short story like " Hunted Down " was published on its own . The film is a nice distillation of the best sequences in the novel , such as the great lawsuit of " Bardell v . Pickwick " ( Dickens first magnificent swipe at British law ) . Of particular notice in the film is the performances of Nigel Patrick as the trouble making scamp Jingle , and James Hayter as Pickwick ( his only real starring role ) . Jingle ( who's dialog looks like a telegram in the novel ) is played as a charming rogue by Patrick . When he nearly gets Mr . Winkle ( James Douglas ) into a duel with two dyspeptic military doctors ( with the immortal names of " Dr . Payne " and " Dr . Slammer " ) , after one diatribe from them Patrick riffles a deck of cards like a " Bronx Cheer " . Hayter , a popular character actor in British film and television , had a smooth and warm sounding voice , and ( in observing prison conditions ) makes the phrase " How pitiable " actually sound correct for the first time . It is not the complete novel - which you should read and enjoy - but it is a nice introduction to it .
493056	3280905	82517	8.0	I'm Still Awaiting Part II and " Hitler on Ice "	Mel Brooks did not invent the comedy spoof movie , but his best work ( " Blazing Saddles " , " Young Frankenstein " , " Dracula , Dead And Loving It " , and " High Anxiety " ) certainly make the most of it - even if some of it gets rather too dirty ( literally dirty - " caca " dirty ) . " History Of The World " is a funny film , but it is not one of his best films . It looks like it was based on bits and pieces of ideas that could have been built up into separate movies : a film about the stone age , a film about the Roman Empire , a film about the French Revolution . I am sure that Brooks was inventive enough to have created three film spoofs , but for some reason he decided to just concentrate on pasting these mini-spoofs together . It has wonderful moments in it - some are thrown away . The four desperate refugees from the Roman Empire , followed by centurions , pray for a miracle . Suddenly they see an old man - Brooks dressed like Moses ( from an earlier sequence in the film ) . A river is parted like the Red Sea with " Moses " arms in the air . The refugees flee thanking God and Moses . In a moment we see there is a robber in back of " Moses " holding him up ( hence his arms in the air ) , and when the robber leaves the old man starts cursing him . Similar stuff is throughout the film ( typical of Brooks ' inventiveness ) . After fleeing Rome , Brooks has reached Palestine and is the waiter serving the " Last Supper " . Besides having a problem when he keeps saying " JEEZUS " causing John Hurt ( who is Christ ) to ask , " Yes ? " , there is the problem of the painting being done by Da Vinci ( Art Metrano ) , and how Brooks manages to get into the background of the masterpiece - holding his tray like a halo behind Hurt ) . Brooks uses a number of his regulars in the film : Madeline Kahn as the Empress Nympho , Dom DeLuis as the Emperor ( one could call him " piggy " after one particular comment about his eating habits ) , Harvey Korman as the foppish Count du Monet , Sid Caesar as a caveman who is full of awe . He was also lucky to have Gregory Hines , usually a dancer but here a strikingly breezy comic , and Orson Welles doing the narration properly ( note his voice's confusion at the start when describing the first heterosexual marriage , followed by the first homosexual one ) . The disjointed style is a minor problem in enjoying the film . Judging from the final scenes from the sequel , Brooks could have done a Viking movie , a skating film about Nazism , and a space musical about the Jews . Alas , only those scenes were ever shot . A second part might not have been a great film either , but it would have been quite as amusing .
492616	3280905	37236	9.0	Gremlins again - this time on our side .	This was the second of three Warner Brothers , anti-Hitler cartoons that were broadcast yesterday on the Turner Classic Film Network's " Cartoon Alley " . Hitler is upset that all attempts to bomb Moscow have met with disaster , so he announces at the start that he will fly a special plane to hit the city . He announces that the flight will be by the greatest Nazi superman in history . When he is asked if will be flown by him , he answers " Mm , COULD BE ! ! " , which was a radio comedy catchphrase of the day ( I think from Jack Benny's program ) . So he sets off , and for most of the cartoon we just watch him flying . But we see these cartoon gremlins ( who this thread explains were caricatures of Fritz Freleng , Chuck Jones , and others , and they proceed to destroy the airplane ( while singing a song to the tune of OY CHICHOINYA " - " We're all gremlins , from the Kremlin " ) . In the end they cause Hitler to crash , and he is so confused by the whole adventure he turns into a caricature of Lew Lehr , who did comic travelogues for the movies . His catch phrase was " Monkeys is the Cwaziest peoples . " The cartoon is funny , and one can see some past influences , When the gremlins are trying a variety of things to do to Hitler , the cartoonist orchestrates them to just miss hitting each other . A cartoon about the building of the world's tallest skyscraper had a sequence when about five or six different construction workers tried to hammer nails in different corners of the structure as planned , but all fail to notice that their nails , if driven up , down , or sideways , will end up nailing some co-worker in his rear . This was also the second Warner's cartoon where the fictitious " Gremlins " popped up to destroy aircraft - the other was a Bugs Bunny cartoon where he is outsmarted by the Gremlins who are trying to destroy the U . S . Air Force plane Bugs is on . That cartoon only had one Gremlin on it , and it also had a joke at the end dealing with gasoline rationing . One of the highlights here was the mask of Joseph Stalin , used to frighten Hitler who was trying to kill some of the Russian Gremlins before that . Stalin also appears in the last of the three Warner cartoons I saw this morning , " Herr Meets HARE " , but was rarely in any of the Warner cartoons made after the " Cold War " began to heat up in the late 1940s .
492859	3280905	41622	9.0	The Shortage of Rubber in 1942	This movie is about how close the U . S . war effort ( and it's " arsenal of Democracy " image ) came to faltering in 1942 . The U . S . has been blessed with many natural resources that other country's don't have . Oil for example , or iron ore and steel . Or even huge forests of trees . But we are not a nation with huge stores of rubber . We are dependent on rubber supplies from abroad . Oddly enough one man had tried to counter this . In the teens of the 20th Century , Thomas Edison had become a close friend to Harvey Firestone , the tire king . Firestone had huge rubber plantations in Liberia , but was aware of the dangers to his shipping of rubber in World War I . He discussed the possibility of an alternative to rubber in the U . S . with Edison . It was the Wizard of Menlo Park's last big project , occupying his life until 1931 when he died . He found that golden rod came closest to being a viable substitute . But little was done with this discovery . In 1942 our rubber was coming from three areas of the globe , and none were next door to us . They were in Liberia and Brazil , both of which were across the Atlantic Ocean to the east or to the south . Nazi u-boats were making shipments from these areas difficult . The third was from southeast Asia , principally from French Indo - China or from Malaya and Indonesia . The movie RED DUST dealt with the rubber plantations in French Indo - China in the 1930s . The Japanese had these plantations and the ones in Malaya and Indonesia in their control from December 1941 onward . To counter the emergency , a rubber-collecting drive occurred across the country ( similar to tin and metal drives that children got involved in ) . But the U . S . government was quick to organize any method to get the rubber that was in Japanese hands . This movie dealt with the scheme that was planned that involved smuggling Rubber out of Malaya . Lionel Barrymore is John Manchester , the editor of the LOS ANGELES RECORD ( based on Manchester Boddy ) . He has gotten Jimmy Stewart , a reporter with a mixed record , to the U . S . Stewart knows about a way to get huge supplies of rubber to the U . S . under the nose ( theoretically ) of the Japanese . The plan requires the government springing his former friend Spencer Tracy , a big time smuggler , out of Alcatraz . With Tracy Stewart would go to Malaya ( with papers showing they are sailors from the neutral Eire - Irish Free State - of Eamon DeValera ) . They would hook up with Tracy's old friend " the Dutchman " ( Sidney Greenstreet ) and he would help find the local wharf rats ( including Gilbert Roland ) to assist the matter . They would have unlimited American gold to get the men they need , and to bribe the three largest plantation owners in the area ( Tom Helmore , Ian MacDonald , and Roland Winters ) . To sweeten the operation for Tracy , who will get a free pardon for his help , he is reunited with Valentina Cortesa - his girlfriend who works in Greenstreet's saloon . The film follows the whole operation , which ( on the whole ) is working well enough - but has it's dangers . The local Japanese Colonel is Richard Loo , who is suspicious ( if dismissive ) of westerners , and he soon zeros in on Tracy and Stewart as distinctly odd figures . And one of the three plantation owners , Winters , is a German . He is a greedy man , but he may be closer to the Japanese than the allies . The film works pretty well . My only complaint is the seeming waste of John Hodiak , who is a Federal agent and is seen for twenty minutes at the start of the film , but only turns up at the tail end of it to deliver a medal ( I won't say to whom ) . This was Sidney Greenstreet's last movie , and he does look a trifle ill , but he certainly maintains his best standards - as a philosophical gent who knows how to safely balance his friendship with Tracy and his " necessary " friendship with Loo ( his relationship with Loo , regarding gambling in his saloon , is similar to that of Rick Blaine with Captain Louis Renault in CASABLANCA ) . Winters plays his few scenes as an untrustworthy type well . Cortesa has a few good scenes with Tracy , including one where he has to forcibly cause her to leave him when she does not want him . Stewart's character believes in maintaining his own counsel . At the beginning he seems a hard bitten reporter who has seen the world and skirted the edge of the law a bit . He is cynical . Only later do we realize that a family tragedy has made him less cynical and more patriotic than we realized .
491905	3280905	22058	9.0	Poor Charley Hall ?	In the pantheon of character actors that supported Laurel and Hardy over the years Charley Hall is second to Jimmy Finleyson as their constant foe ( or victim ) . Hall was a good journeyman comedian , and appeared in many shorts besides those with the boys . Inevitably they irritate him ( which may be why Finn is somewhat higher in the rating of their foes - Finn reacts to their comments , sometimes asking for mistreatment , but frequently being somewhat in the right ; Charley usually just is bad tempered . In BE BIG Ollie and Stan are trying to get some ice cream for dinner at home that night . Charley is selling ice cream , and repeatedly tells Stan that they don't have Chocolate ( apparently Stan's favorite ) . Finally instead of rattling off all the flavors he has , Charley grits his teeth and decides to list all the flavors he doesn't have ! It still doesn't work . It's very possible that Charley's best performance against L & H was in LAUGHING GRAVY ( possibly THEM THAR HILLS is equally good - but that was one of two shorts that are interconnected ) . LAUGHING GRAVY stands on it's own feet - it was a sound version of the silent short ANGORA LOVE , about the difficulties of the boys sneaking a goat into their rooming house when it won't stop following them . Later this plot would also be used in THE CHIMP , with a chimpanzee as the animal they have to keep hiding from their landlord ( Billy Gilbert ) . But here it is Hall who is the landlord , and has been having problems with these two roomers some time before the short begins . He keeps being awaken by them and keeps threatening to send them out into the snow drifts outside . Stan has a cute little dog , " Laughing Gravy " , and does not want to put the dog out into the snow . But there is a no-pets rule . The short expands on how they boys try to keep the dog in the room , but try to keep Charley from finding out . The results are usually at Ollie's expense , although both boys get locked out at one point . Ollie keeps getting soaked , and Charley keeps getting angrier and angrier at Ollie's making one disturbance after another . The culmination is when they are washing the dog , and Stan sees Hall staring at them - and pushes the dog out and starts washing Ollie's head in the soapy water instead ! They are told to leave the boarding house . Here an interesting thing developed . It seems that many of the Laurel & Hardy films had scenes shot that were cut out ( and not necessarily by television ) . Few of these have been found , though occasionally we know what they are ( the Spanish version of PARDON US has a sequence involving the boys saving the warden's daughter from Walter Long during a fire - which apparently was in the English version too , but finally cut out of that version ) . In the case of LAUGHING GRAVY a ten minute sequence involving Stan getting a telegram and Ollie dying to know what it is about was dropped . They are packing when the telegram is delivered , and Stan reads it , but quickly folds it into his pocket . Ollie keeps asking what is on the telegram , but Stan says it's nothing . Ollie gets so annoyed , he starts singing a song , " You'll be sorry when it's too late . . . when our friendship has turned to hate ! " Stan finally gives in , and gives Ollie the message . Stan has inherited a fortune from an uncle - but he has to give up his friendship with Ollie , who the uncle could not stand . The sequence is not a bad one , but one realizes why it was cut - it did nothing to further the plot line of the short . In fact , it was rather weak in comparison with the rest of the short ( and costs the short a " 10 " out of " 10 " - it gets a " 9 " as a result ) . Still it is nice to occasionally see a lost sequence returned to any film . The real conclusion is when Hall ( holding a hunting rifle ) is waiting for the boys and Lauging Gravy to leave the boarding house . But as they are about to leave they hear nailing . They open the door and see a policemen has put up a quarantine sign there - Stan and Ollie can't leave with their dog now ! Shocked beyond endurance by this twist , Hall says there is just so much a man can take . We see him walk off the camera's range . Then we hear two shots . The policeman enters to check the body , while Stan , Ollie , and Laughing Gravy head back upstairs . A really good conclusion to the short .
492641	3280905	49470	9.0	Hitchcock's remake of 1956 : What Will Be Will Be	THE original film of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was made in 1934 , and was about a bunch of foreign agents ( led by Peter Lorre ) who kidnap a little girl to force her parents to keep their mouths shut about an assassination plot they are planning at London's Albert Hall . Hitchcock took this story to develop his memories of an incident in 1911 , the Siege of Sidney Street , where a set of police killing anarchists ( actually Russian revolutionaries ) fought a pitch battle against army forces sent by Home Secretary Winston Churchill until artillery set their building on fire , and they were all killed . The original film was not a great one , but it was well directed and acted , and is still entertaining . But it bothered Hitch . He felt that the sequence leading to the assassination attempt at Albert Hall was not very well handled in the first film . Indeed , if you compare the two films the assassination is markedly different and more dramatic in the 1956 remake than in the original . In the original , the assassin is seen setting himself up in the Hall , to fire his gun at a given moment ( when two cymbals crash ) . When Edna Best sees him about to fire she screams , but we do not see what happened . We see Lorre and his co-conspirators listening to the concert on the radio , and hearing the scream , a shot and consternation from the audience . Then the assassin returns , shame-faced . We are also allowed a sight of the dignitary being attended to while unconscious and wounded . The build up at the Albert Hall is more complex , with Hitchcock concentrating on the confusion of Doris Day ( after the assassin reminds her of her child's fate ) , and the music ( by Bernard Herrmann ) building to the crescendo - we are even shown the turning of the page leading to the musical passage . The dignitary was a bearded old fogy in the first film . Here Hitch got a bald , plump man who looked very innocent to the viewer . And when the unstrung Day screams , it causes the assassin to misfire , and the dignitary to turn ( he is shot in his arm as a result ) . The assassin tries to escape , but while tussling with a policeman in the opera box , he topples over to his death . It's one of many differences in the two films . There is no siege of Sidney Street now , but a final confrontation in the embassy of the country the dignitary rules ( it is not a grubby bunch of conspirators , but people working for a conspiracy to kill their Premier ) . The ambassador is involved in the plot . The first murder is not at a party in Switzerland ( as in the 1934 film ) but at a street bazaar in Marraketch , with the person who tells Jimmy Stewart the assassination plot disguised as a native ( why ? ) . Hitchcock was working with big budgets in the middle and late 1950s he could only dream of in the 1930s . Instead of using many small models and sets , he could shoot on location - and colorful ones . He could also use superstars in his films ( not just well known figures in British and Continental pictures like Leslie Banks and Pierre Fresney , and Lorre ) like Stewart and Day . Interestingly enough the rest of the cast is not as sparkling ( it is not like Grant - Saint - and Mason in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ) , but it is highly competent . Bernard Miles ( later Lord Miles ) was best recalled as Newman Noggs , the clerk who assists the hero in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY ( 1946 ) . Here he plays an ultimately sinister part . Brenda De Banzie is best recalled as Charles Laughton's capable daughter who marries John Mills in HOBSON'S CHOICE . She is Miles ' wife , and the troubled conscience in the kidnap plot . The films's suspense and color make it much more entertaining than the original , and it becomes the only Hitchcock film to produce a song hit : " Que Sera , Sera ! " Doris Day made the most of that little tune , which becomes a key to the resolution of the film's plot . It is not the greatest Hitchcock film , but it is certainly one of the finest he created .
493445	3280905	46754	9.0	A Talky Film , But Highly Compelling For All That	I have always felt that if Humphrey Bogart had not died in 1957 he would have gradually left the lead roles of his greatest films to pick up very juicy character roles , and the film that convinces of this is THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA . His Harry Dawes is not the hero of this tragedy - there is no hero , just a heroine who loses all . Harry is her closest confidante and guide , for he sees the talent that makes Maria Vargas ( Ava Gardner ) the great film star she becomes , but he realizes that she is a very real and good person - but a terribly naive one for all that in a corrupt world . It is Harry's sad duty not only to help tell the audience the story , but to watch ( one might say inevitably ) Maria destroy herself . Harry is one of the people that wealthy control freak Kirk Edwards ( Warren Stevens ) finds available because they are on beams end . Harry has had drinking problems , and his career as a film director is in the toilet . Edwards has found Maria in the slums of Madrid , and believes she has great potential . He wants Harry to direct her in a film test , just to be sure . Harry has little choice , and does the test - but he gets to know Maria and win her trust . And he finds a way to somehow do his work for Edwards but give Maria a fighting chance to not be under Edwards ' iron glove control . We watch Maria's career progress , with her honesty able to capture public approval when she runs to defend her father from a homicide charge . Later we see her successfully break with first Edwards , and then his Latin American rival Alberto Bravano ( Marius Goring ) and then falling in love with the Count Vincenzo Torlato - Favrini ( Rossano Brazzi ) whom she marries in the belief he is her long awaited knight in shining armor . But the Count has a secret , and in learning it and trying to overcome it Maria destroys all she achieved in four short years . All of Joseph Mankiewicz's films are literate - he is possibly the most verbally careful of all major film directors . Some by the way find that THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA may stray too far afield because of the dialog ( most of the film's narration is during a funeral ) . But he still gets some very effective scenes in . The confrontation between Edwards , a humorless example of the Puritan work ethic , and Bravano ( who for all his defects is honest about enjoying his money and position to appreciate living ) at a party is a great highpoint . So is such a minor moment as when a royal pretender to a throne makes a tragically accurate comparison between himself and Torlatto - Favrini . So stick to that dialog - it pays off . The film is also a roman-a-clef . Some of the characters are obviously clones of real people . Edwards the millionaire control freak is based on Howard Hughes , especially with private contracts for performers like Jane Russell . Bravano has a lot of the Dominican Republic playboy Porfirio Ruberosa . The background of Maria Vargas is supposedly based on that of Rita Casino ( Rita Hayworth ) . I am sure that Harry Dawes is based on some directors that Mankiewicz knew of , as was Edmond O'Brien's publicist and factotum Oscar Muldoon ( catch his scene on the telephone talking to Harry when the latter is in Hollywood and Oscar is in London , or his final break with Edwards - " the Party's Over " - and realize this role , not D . O . A . , was the one that netted O'Brien his Oscar for best supporting actor ) . A fascinating study of the limits of movie fame and fortune in winning happiness . Final note : Mankiewicz apparently could not avoid having a small joke at the expense of his audience . When we see Maria's first film , the marquee has a poster that mentions the screenplay is by " Lloyd Richards " . " Lloyd Richards " ( Hugh Marlowe ) was the dramatist who wrote plays for Margo Channing and Eve Harrington in Mankiewicz's classic ALL ABOUT EVE !
492899	3280905	52561	10.0	Preminger's Anatomy of a Rape Murder	ANATOMY OF A MURDER was Otto Preminger's attempt to relate a subject hinted about in motion pictures , but rarely gone into great detail . The subject was rape and it's consequences , and how the rape victim frequently found herself under attack in our law courts when the issues of the case hinged on her moral innocence or guilt . The story takes place in the upper peninsula of Michigan , near a resort town . There is a military base nearby , and Ben Gazzara is a lieutenant there married to Lee Remick . It is the second marriage for both of them . Remick is extraordinary pretty , and her best features are highlighted by the tight fitting casual clothes she wears . She also is aware of how attractive she is to other men than her husband . One night , while Gazzara is sleeping after dinner , Remick goes to the local bar for some fun ( austensibly drinking and playing pinball ) . She is playing it with the bar owner , who subsequently gives her a car ride home . Except for her pet dog , nobody witnesses what happens in the car - her story is that the man raped her twice , and she ran home and told her husband . Gazzara , one hour later , goes to the bar and shoots the owner five times . Was there a rape ? The police made a cursory examination , and find that while there are some signs of a struggle , there is no trace of sperm . Remick's panties are missing , but they may just have been hidden by her . She did have some bruises ( including one of her eye ) , but they could be due to a beating from anyone else . Gazzara is arrested and charged with the murder . And Remick calls in Jimmy Stewart . He was the former District Attorney for the town , but has been recently defeated after ten years of service . His staff consists of Eve Arden , and ( when he sober ) Arthur O'Connor . Stewart has handled prosecutions , and has never handled any criminal defense . He would not only face the current District Attorney ( Brooks West ) but an additional big city prosecutor ( George C . Scott - in his first major movie role ) . Stewart finds that aside from the ironclad case the prosecution has , the lack of evidence conclusively showing a rape , and the time issue of one hour between said rape and the killing , prevent him putting forward a defense of temporary insanity . He also finds that both Gazzara and Remick are difficult figures to fit into a " respectable " couple image for what he has to do . There had been plenty of first rate courtroom dramas in previous years in the movies , such as THE STORY ON PAGE ONE and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION , but nothing had been so carefully shown as this case was . The tactics of both defense and prosecution are demonstrated , with the careful maneuvering of questions and answers , and the attempt to probe for weaknesses in each other's cases . And Scott's cross-examination of Remick , bringing out her somewhat promiscuous character , reminds us of what usually happened ( and still does ) in rape cases . The character of the wise judge in the case was played by Joseph Welch , the Boston legal whiz who smashed Senator Joseph McCarthy to kindling very quietly and with dignity in 1954 at the Army-McCarthy hearings on television . Here , in his only movie role , Judge Welch shows the same courtly calm and dignity that adds to the sense of reality of the film . Well acted and directed this film has to be on anyone's list of top ten court room films .
492468	3280905	32599	10.0	Her Guy Walter	Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s . They created two of the funniest farces in American drama , TWENTIETH CENTURY ( about theater people ) and THE FRONT PAGE . The latter was based on their experiences as news reporters in those crazy days in Chicago , where the newspapers concentrated on sensationalism and the politics was thoroughly corrupt . The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely . For all the exaggeration of how Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson manipulate police , politicians , reporters , and civilians to get their scoop , the story remains relevant for several reasons . The political balance in a big Mayoralty election is precarious due to the Earl Williams case . Williams has shot a policeman who is African-American , a big local voting block , and they want him punished . The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office , but the Governor ( who is from the rival party ) believes the killer is insane ( or at least mentally deficient ) . So already ( as you see ) race , politics , and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in . Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police , and City Hall , cynical politics based on a man's life , and questions about privacy and a free press . For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance . There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE , starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns , and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson . It is a good version , and both stars do well with their parts ( and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience ) . But when the film was remade in 1940 , Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter ( and previous wife ) of Burns . His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too . Burns is a nasty , conniving s . o . b . who would kill for a good story . Menjou was somewhat dapper ( he was usually dapper ) in the role , but the hardness under the presentable shell was there . And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal , and Walter's former wife , you had to make Walter look more interesting . So Walter is turned into Cary Grant . There was a search for Hildy , involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities . Neither ended up playing him . Instead it went to Rosalind Russell . It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip . Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well , but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed . She really does balance well ( in this film ) with Grant , given their characters . Motivation changes a little . This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops , but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fianc√© Bruce ( the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy ) . And they oddly work ( Hawks manages to keep them under control ) . Also , as the story is now twelve years older than the original play , certain changes occur in Walter's political views . He does dislike the gang ( led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart ) running the city , and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia . This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition , but it does suggest that Burns has more depth . It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE , and one of the funniest films ever made . The entire cast shines ( look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp , and have told lies about John Qualen ( Williams ) - she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room , and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself - and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey , Porter Hall , and the others , and says " Gentlemen of the Press ! " with heavy cynical irony ) . And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone , the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies . It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another .
491612	3280905	54412	10.0	A Shattering Dissection of a Scottish Regiment	It is hard to say anything new about this marvelous film - possibly the last great film Alec Guiness had the starring role in ( although some STAR WAR fans may disagree with that assessment ) . Guiness as Major Jock Sinclair is a man's man , and the popular head of a Scottish army regiment . Since the war ended he has been in charge of it , and there have been no complaints . But one day he learns that the Army brass have decided to appoint John Mills ( Lt . Col . Basil Barrow ) as the Regiment's new commander . Guiness is not a coward - he has fought his way up the ranks on the battlefields of Europe , and the others in the regiment know this . But Mills is an unknown quantity . He is aloof , and he is English . Nobody can tell whether or not he has any inner reserves of strength or what was once called " moxie " to win their respect . So soon Mills finds that while his commands are heard , the men are still basically looking to Guiness for real leadership . It becomes a quiet but steady battle between the two men to see who is the real head of the regiment . Even when , due to personal problems , Guiness is arrested for drunkenness , Mills keeps fumbling his attempts to put him under control . Part of the problem is psychological - Mills has had a very rough time during the war . He was tortured badly by the Nazis in one of their camps . He has been just beginning to pull himself together . The lack of respect he is being shown is not helping . The characterizations in the film are wonderful , in particular Dennis Price . Mills had been the star of GREAT EXPECTATIONS in the late 1940s , with Guiness in support . Price had been the actual star , as the scheming Louis D'Ascoyne - Mazzini , in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS , again opposite Guiness . Here Price is Major Charles " Scotty " Scott , who has usually been Guiness's closest friend , but has stumbled . In typical Price double-dealing , he has made a play for Kay Walsh , Guiness's girlfriend , and has not been totally rejected ( when Guiness learns of this he goes into his bender , which leads to his arrest ) . Price however is more complex than one would initially believe . He , of all the regiment officers , does not go to Guiness to double-check the orders of Mills . Price feels that Mills , as commanding officer , needs no double-checking . The others are there to obey him . But then Mills decides to be nice to that drunken scamp Guiness - and Guiness and his friends sees this as weakness , not kindness . Mills finds that the last shreds of his rank's dignity are gone . . . especially after he and Price have some quiet words while Price is playing billiards . Basically Price tells Mills that it is impossible now to have any respect for the Lt . Col . And this leads to the final double tragedy at the end . Dennis Price ( from what I have read on this board ) had many family and financial problems , and emotional problems that led to an alcoholism that smashed his career . But his performance as " Scotty " , relatively short in comparison to Guiness and Mills in this film , was a quietly effective and superb one . One only wishes his personal demons could have been controlled , so that he could have given us more performances as this one .
492420	3280905	73766	10.0	The Final " Voyage of Discovery " of Lewis and Clark	Neil Simon's THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays . Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original , the former being picky and neat , the latter being slovenly and loose . Simon would rewrite ( less successfully ) the play in the 1990s as THE NEW ODD COUPLE , with female roommates . He made it a mixed couple ( a woman with her daughter , and a man ) in THE GOODBYE GIRLS . He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS , a Broadway hit starring Jack Alberson and Sam Levine as Al Lewis and Willie Clark , the aged , semi-retired Vaudevillians . Here the " apartment " problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't stand each other . The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie , and George Burns as Al . In actuality , Al probably does not think totally badly of Willie - Willie is pathological on the subject of Al . First Al had little habits , such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter " t " , and slightly jabbing Willie with his index finger , on stage . Secondly , Al retired when his wife died . Willie was not ready to retire ( and has been forcing his nephew and agent , Ben ( Richard Benjamin ) to try to get him jobs in commercials . But Willie can't remember lines unless they are funny , and keeps flubbing them . So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial . Ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy . He does bring Al to see Willie , and the sparks begin flying , as neither can figure out what the other is doing ( and this is just in rehearsal . On top of that , Willie is insisting on changes ( minor ones , but they throw off Al ) such as saying " ENTER ! ! ! " when Al knocks on the door . The initial rehearsal is a failure , but Ben manages to get them to the taping of the show . The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Al's neck ? The three leads , Matthau , Burns , and Benjamin , do very well with the one-liners , frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter ( example : " Chest pains . . . I'm getting chest pains Uncle Willie . Every Thursday I come here and get chest pains ! " " So , come on Fridays ! " ) . Benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle , although Matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult ( he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville ) . Matthau has a little better grasp on reality ( at first ) than Burns , who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly . Burns is not senile - he takes things slowly . But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement . I call this a final " Voyage of Discovery " for our modern Lewis and Clark . Al and Willie transcend their old skits , as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought . Even the irascible Willie admits that Al may be ( to him ) a pain in the ass , but he was a funny man . Burns was not the original choice for the part of " Al Lewis " ( supposedly Dale of the team Smith and Dale ) . Jack Benny was . Benny probably would have done a good job , but ill-health forced him out ( he died in 1975 ) . Burns ( whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator ) turned in such a fine performance that he got the " Oscar " for best supporting actor , and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD ! ; OH GOD , YOU DEVIL ; and GOING IN STYLE . He died in 1996 age 100 , having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife Gracie Allan .
493107	3280905	112749	10.0	A " House Divided " Literally : Apartheid in South Africa in 1948	I read CRY , THE BELOVED COUNTRY in high school , and was quite impressed by it's dignified and somber retelling of the tragedy of modern South Africa under the apartheid system that was in place at the time . Alan Paton had a literary and political career in the Union of South Africa , and was opposed to the system that kept down the native Black Africans while the native white Africans ruled them . His novel was quite shocking in his home country , and led to his being forbidden to be published there . Now he seems remarkably prescient . The novel was made into a film in 1951 , which I never saw . But I have finally seen this version today and while it whittles down the plot a bit , it's emphasis on the dual tragedy of the Kumalo and Jarvis families actually enhances the effect . James Earl Jones plays Rev . Stephen Kumalo , an honorable man from the countryside who goes to Johannisburg to find his son Absolom . From the start we see contrasts . The beauties and glories of the magnificent veld v . the dirt and grime of the city . The large home of the Jarvis family as opposed to the poor homes of Rev . Kumalo . Rev . Kumalo goes to an address in one of the slums of Johannisburg that the Blacks were forced to live in . He tries to trace his son , with the assistance of a fellow minister , Rev . Msimangu ( Vasi Kunene ) and gets less helpful assistance from his brother John Kumalo ( Charles S . Dutton ) . The latter is a local politician , but is soon revealed to be an opportunist and crook . Eventually Rev . Kumalo finds his son has been in trouble with the police , and recently released from a reformatory . This was due to Absolom having a pregnant girlfriend . The Reverend traces his son to the girlfriend , but she has not heard from him for a few days . The next thing that the Reverend hears is that Absolom and two others ( including the son of John Kumalo ) were involved in a burglary murder that resulted in the death of Ian Jarvis . Tom Jarvis , long used to accept the harsh separation of the races as natural , comes to a stunning discovery - his son's posthumous condemnation of the social system of South Africa as one to abhor as it breeds crime and hatred . The discovery of this side to his son leads him to slowly find a bridge uniting him with Rev . Kumalo , as they both find the system destroy their boys . One has to see the film to understand this bridging of the the lives of the fathers ( ironically neighbors who rarely knew each other or each other's families in the " normal " period ) . One also sees the warning that Paton instilled in his readers : Rev . Msimangu's fear that when the White race finally turns to love the Black race will only accept hate . Much is dropped of the four hundred fifty page novel , such as Paton's ritualistic use of descriptions again and again ( which can't be translated to film successfully ) or plot threads regarding the final break between the Reverend and his brother John , or the Reverend trying to trace other lost children from the town ( one is mentioned briefly ) . But the somberness of the tragedy of Absolom , who with Ian become joint blood sacrifices to a racist state is total . The performances of Jones and Harris are equally effective . Altogether a first rate film version of the novel .
492003	3280905	37008	10.0	" She Gave Her Very First Kiss To You - It's Laura . . . But She's Only A Dream . . . . "	I guess LAURA will always make the top ten list of film noir because of it's wit and cast - in particular one actor who demonstrated a waspishness that had not been seen before in film except by his fellow homosexual actor Monty Wooley . I am speaking , of course , of Clifton Webb , who had been a great Broadway star of the 1920s and 1930s , and then ( when that career began to peter out ) got the nod to play Waldo Lydecker , and became a fixture of the movies from 20th Century Fox from 1944 to 1960 or so . Webb's carrying off the film's notices ( except for general approval of the work of Otto Preminger as director ) is ironic because the film's name centers on it's heroine : Laura , played by Gene Tierney . She is a career woman - a talented artist and advertising copy creator , who becomes a leading model - a fictional counterpart to say Grace Kelly a few years later . She does this when she gains the hard attention of Lydecker ( who initially rejects her attempts to talk to him ) but he has second thoughts . Later he admits it's due to his sexual fascination with her . The problem for Waldo is , of course , that no matter how much passion he does feel for Laura , he doesn't have the physical wherewithal to get an equal reaction from her . She sees him as a fine mentor and friend , but nothing else . And he feels this rejection keenly - too keenly . Today , a film version would show the sexual confusion of the man , as his personality shows his homosexual leanings ( they crop up occasionally towards Dana Andrews ' McPherson , who seems to have a muscularity that fascinates Waldo ) , and his definite wish to consummate with Laura . Poor fellow - it just was impossible . Yet it might have worked - a so-called " white marriage " like that of Cole and Linda Porter ( close friendship , but going their own ways sexually ) . When looking over Laura's attempts at a heterosexual boy-friend , Jacoby the artist ( whom Waldo maliciously destroys in his newspaper column ) and later Shelby Carpenter ( Vincent Price ) we see she wants a masculine hero . A case can be made , by the way , that Laura's interest in Jacoby was mere amusement ( we see her enjoying Waldo's column attack in the newspaper ) . As for Shelby , whatever was wrong with Waldo he certainly saw through the socialite as the questionable type he really was . In fact , McPherson ends up thoroughly agreeing on this with Waldo and in a physical way . The film ( as it is now ) gave her Dana Andrew's detective . He , it is , who rescues her in the end . But there will be a price . Leslie Halliwell , in discussing the film , pointed out that Waldo ( whatever his feelings about rivals ) respected Laura's true talents , and would have always encouraged her there , and assisted her in developing them . Andrew's McPherson expected his " dame " wife would be at home , cooking , cleaning , and ( presumably ) being ready for sex . Halliwell ended his discussion suggesting that Laura would have ended up missing Waldo's personality and support terribly . Curiously enough , the original film would have been quite different in it's resolution . McPherson goes back to Laura's apartment after he first meets all the suspects , and he sits on a sofa looking at her picture . He is supposed to meet Waldo , coming to assist on the investigation . The next forty minutes or so of the film is the heart of it , leading to the tragic conclusion as it now exists . But in the original script , we see McPherson being awaken by Waldo shaking him on the sofa . McPherson had dreamed the entire story the audience saw . He leaves with Waldo to jointly try to find the killer ( presumably it would have had to be Shelby ) . Whether or not it would have led to a " beautiful friendship " between effete newspaper / radio personality and detective is doubtful , but it probably would have led to some mutual sympathy .
492255	3280905	275375	10.0	Again a gem I caught on You Tube	The Second World War may be over sixty years old , but it still is quite alive as one of the most photographed and recorded conflicts of all time . The pictures caught by newsreels of the Blitz in London are among the most powerful images of that conflict - and may have done more to solidify American public opinion against the Axis than anything else before Pearl Harbor . But to the British it was not something to horrify an audience that would then turn around and go home to safe beds blessing the two large oceans that seemed to protect them . English , Welsh , Scots , and Irish were within bombing distance of German planes , and subject to months , even years , of attack . So this was a life-and-death matter . GO TO BLAZES is a brief comic short starring Will Hays , a name not too well known ( unfortunately ) in the U . S . But from 1933 or so up to the war he made a series of comedies with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott that critics have compared to the Marx Brothers - films like ASK A POLICEMAN or OH MR . PORTER ! . Hays is similar to Groucho in that he is always in a minor leadership post ( schoolmaster or cop ) which he bungles or uses for his own advantage , hampered by his even dumber two associates ( Moffatt is the fat young man , and Marriott is the elderly nincompoop ) . Somehow they ( like Groucho , Harpo , Chico , and Zeppo ) bungle their way to triumph in the end . In GO TO BLAZES , Hays is married to Muriel George , and they live with their grown up daughter Thora Hird . Hays is not too happy that George is not there to give him a hot dinner , but he's told it is in the stove . While his daughter is studying math , he tells her he has been asked to give a lecture on putting out fires from Nazi incendiary bombs . He is certain he's up to it , as he has read the pamphlet on the subject . We see him practicing before a mirror , and as he gives his speech we see the reality behind his expertise . He is dumb enough to try to carry his fire fighting equipment while still holding onto a pan of bacon he was cooking for his dinner . He keeps lucking out actually - he's so incompetent he can't stop one bomb going from the roof to the basement , accidentally landing into a bucket of water ( he claims he strategically placed it there . Ms George returns and she too is surprised that he is going to give this talk . Then they realize an incendiary has hit the house again , but while Hay acts with typical bumbling Ms George and Ms Hird act promptly and manage to control the fire quickly . At the end Ms George insists Hay take lessons on incendiary controls that the government is giving . He hesitates , until he learns where the classes are near . Less than ten minutes long it is an amusing comedy . Until now it is the only complete film of Hays I have been fortunate to see ( on You Tube , as I said above ) . I strongly recommend it as a way to see what this fine comedian was like . Also as a reminder of what the British public had to put up with from 1940 - 1945 in wartime .
492812	3280905	95613	10.0	" I Am An Actor ! "	This film proves with JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT that Alan King was capable of a good film career . The story here does not deal with secretive billionaires and their angry mistresses , but with a man who left his family in New York City decades before to pursue a career in Hollywood . But Abe has never been more than a background extra . When his son Abie ( Billy Chrystal ) is recovering from a heart attack , he goes to Hollywood to see his father for the first time in years . Abie discovers that his father has never even had a real speaking part ( the closest is when he was the sixth or seventh man in SPARTACUS to yell " I am Spartacus ! " ) . Naturally , given the shattering effect that Abe's abandonment of the family had , it does not seem to Abie that his father had much to show for it . Abe , who has become part of the Hollywood community ( he is usually seen with his fellow extras , but we see he does know Sean Connery by first names ) . He is reasonably happy - but Abie keeps dismissing him as a hack , not an artist . The arrival of Abie's girlfriend Lisa ( JoBeth Williams ) does not help matters at first , but she manages to bridge the anger and contempt that the son feels for his father , and slowly they do find some degrees of similarities . Abie loves playing the trumpet , for example , and does it well . But Abie discovers that there is something physically wrong about his father - a sudden memory problem causing the father to recite a scene he liked from INHERIT THE WIND . The prognosis is grim . So Abie decides to help his father accomplish his greatest wish : get a full scene in a movie with actual dialog . Most of the comments here have been fairly negative , insisting that it is a very lachrymose and overly sentimental tale . There is no denying that it is ( ultimately ) a tragic story - but the performances ( particularly King as a proud and touchy man , who will not admit that his life has been less than a success ) are good for the three leads . King's performance mingled pathos and comedy quite well . Witness the scene where he was trying to choose among his friends for the extras in a science fiction film , where he is dressed in a lobster costume . King shows his sauciness at a self-important assistant director , but he also shows the start of his mental / physical collapse in the same sequence ( quite a change of pace ) . Similarly his interview with the casting director for the speaking part that Abie sneaks into is done with great charm and dignity . It was a first rate performance - and proved that King was an actor .
492273	3280905	54698	10.0	Two drifters off to see the world	It's a little odd watching BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and realizing that of it's main stars only Patricia Neal , Mickey Rooney , and Jose Luis de Villalonga ( who played the wealthy Brazilian in the movie ) are still alive , as is the director Blake Edwards . Audrey Hepburn , George Peppard , Buddy Ebsen , Martin Balsam , John McGiver , Alan Reed Jr . , Stanley Adams , and Dorothy Whitney are all gone , as is Truman Capote and George Axelrod and the cats who played " Cat " . The city of New York is still a fascinating one , but much of it has changed . For instance , the card catalogs of the 42nd Street Public Library that Holly Golightly and Paul Varjak visit are not in those card drawers as they showed in the film scene . They were photocopied into multi-volume sets of card catalog volumes in the early 1970s , and since then the remainder have been put on computers . Even in the late 1960s and early 1970s the reading room did not have any sculptures in them - just desks and library shelves and the central area to pick up the books you ordered . The period of the film is quite set in New York City in 1959 - 61 . Take a look at the " Halloween masks " on sale in the Woolworth's that Holly and Paul steal . Among the masks they try on is one of Huckleberry Hound , the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character who was popular in 1960 . It is mentioned on this thread that the mask reminds us of the lyrics in " MOON RIVER " regarding " my huckleberry friend " . But that reference was to " Huckleberry Finn " , and his being found on the Mississippi River ( possibly the original for the " Moon River " of the song ) . It had nothing to do with the cartoon character . ( Come to think of it , Woolworth's itself is a thing of the past - it having gone out of business five years ago . ) But the story is still quite compelling , and Holly remains Audrey Hepburn's best remembered performance ( even more than her Royal Princess in ROMAN HOLIDAY ) . Only her performance as Eliza Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY is as recalled by name , and Holly is more glamorous from the start . Holly is not really " Holly " but Lula Mae Barnes Golightly - one time second wife of Doc Golightly ( Ebsen ) , who tired of country living and got an annulment , and has only tried to get some financial footing to help herself and her brother Fred ( who is currently in the army ) . She has always found life hard ( Doc tells Paul that Lula and Fred were caught by him stealing turkey eggs when kids ) . So Holly discovers that only if she can be a sophisticate can she break her poverty routes . She is " discovered " by Hollywood movie boss O . J . Berman ( Balsam ) who classifies her as " a real phony " , meaning that she really buys the glitz and color he has taught her . But Holly is a call girl , and she has not found the man who can rescue her ( and brother Fred ) from poverty . She does find a fellow drifter - Paul Varjak , a writer and kept man for wealthy ( Mrs . Failenson ) . He is living in the apartment above Holly's , and the two do become close ( in the original story they only become confidants - Paul in the novel is gay ) . Slowly , in the film Paul finds that Holly is such a fragile type that he falls in love with her - unlike himself she needs protection . But she is determined to hook her millionaire - so she goes after " Rusty Trawler " the ninth richest man in the world , and " Jose Da Silva Pereira " - the wealthy Brazilian ) . In the meantime , to pay the rent between her " dates " Holly agrees to deliver " weather reports " from Sing Sing prison , where she visits mobster Sally Tomato ( Alan Reed in a really nice little cameo ) . She is unaware of the meaning of those messages . Holly is something of a classy feather-head , not being able to understand the reports of " snow " in New Orleans from Uncle Sally , nor being able to understand how she gets under the skin of her neighbor , the photographer Mr . Yunioshi ( Mickey Rooney ) . She drives the latter crazy by her constantly waking him up to let her into the apartment when she forgets her passkey , and also by her loud parties . Yet even Yunioshi is secretly captivated by this annoying neighbor : notice how she gets him to calm down by promising to allow him he'll photograph her in the buff . All the performances are fine ( of note see Ebsen in his saddest part , as the broken-hearted Doc , but notice too John McGiver's fine salesman at Tiffany's ) . Rooney's Yunioshi is now considered racist , but it was not seen as such in 1961 - in fact it was normal ( compare to Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON ) . On the whole the film still is well worth watching .
491841	3280905	93660	10.0	The Greatest Star at a Sanity Hearing	NUTS was a play that was turned into this film that has a first rate cast headed by Barbara Streisand , including Richard Dreyfus , Maureen Stapleton , Karl Malden , Eli Wallach , Robert Webber , James Whitmore , and Leslie Nielson and a top director ( Martin Ritt ) . But it has not gotten the notice it's deserved among Streisand's top performances . I will get to that in a moment . Streisand is a hooker who has been arrested for the murder of a " John " she picked up . Nielson is the " John " , and his performance here is a type of throwback to the usually villainous parts he played in the early half of his career , before he demonstrated his mastery of deadpan comedy . He tries to get rough with Streisand , and in the process of defending herself she causes him to get stabbed . Taken to court for arraignment she finds her mother and step-father ( Stapleton and Malden ) have arranged for her attorney ( William Prince ) to plead guilty on account of insanity . She gets quite upset about this , and manages to punch Prince in the mouth , breaking some teeth , and making him decide to drop this client . Dreyfus , a struggling defense attorney , is picked by the arraignment judge to handle the defense . Slowly Dreyfus and Streisand find a way of working together - and find it is an uphill battle . Streisand insists that she is sane , and that it was an accident not murder . Dreyfus believes her , but has to fight a top flight assistant district attorney ( Webber ) who has an accredited psychiatric expert ( Wallach ) ready to testify to Streisand's insanity . Fortunately the Judge ( Whitmore ) is pretty fair minded . I notice that parts of the resolution of the story appear on the other comments on this board , so I will refrain . Suffice to say that Streisand not only discredits Wallach quite well , but she also manages to trace her choice of profession to a damaged childhood . NUTS , as I said before , did not get the exposure of THE WAY WE WERE or WHAT'S UP DOC ? or THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES or YENTL as a key performance in the Streisand legend , and yet it bears comparison to them or her two appearances as Fanny Brice . Why was it ignored ? I suspect it was that it came at the point where Streisand began making movies every couple of years instead of year after year , and that it was also made just before the change in Streisand film career when she turned director as well as actor . YENTL , THE PRINCE OF TIDES , and THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES were far more personal films than NUTS was . Then again , it was not the first time Streisand handled the role of a hooker . She played a similar role in THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT opposite George Segal ( although that was a comedy , not a drama ) . So it fell into a hole in the Streisand career - and was unfairly forgotten . It should not be , for it was well made , well acted , and thoughtful about the causes of the choices in lifestyles we make . I give it " 10 " out of " 10 " .
493079	3280905	266425	10.0	Why it is so pleasant to hear about his assassination in Czechoslovakia	There is a moment of ironical comedy ( with a bitter aftertaste ) that I always liked in Stanley Kramer's JUDGMENT AT NUREMBURG where the whole matter of the organized death known as the " Holacaust " is brought up against the defendants for the first time . After all , the four jurists helped speed along the death of those millions of Jews , of Gypsies , of the feeble minded ( like Monty Clift ) , of the political incorrect , that one has to show the results . There is a luncheon break and the four jurists are eating . Werner Klemperer is fuming , " How dare they ! " about blaming these guardians of the law for being butchers . One of them ( I think it's Torben Meyer ) does not believe the statistics quoted by Richard Widmark in court . How could they kill so many in such a short time . It turns out that the jurists sit at one table and in back is a second table with Concentration Camp personnel eating their lunch . Meyer turns and asks one ( Otto Waldis ) , " It is impossible , isn't it ? " Waldis is munching nonchalantly on his lunch and says , " Well . . . actually it can be done quite simply . " Waldis than proceeds to give a perfectly logical argument of a technician based on a modern international railroad and engineering system that shows it is simple ! Meyer looks very shocked at finding it is not that difficult to create a death system like the Nazi one . His reaction is the funny part . The bitter part is thinking of the results , and the matter-of-fact reaction of Waldis . CONSPIRACY is the story of the actual creation of that system , and it's chief architect Reinhard Heydrich . We have met this creature before - when I discussed one of the two film based on his demise in 1942 ( tragically after he created " the final solution " , not before ) . In Douglas Sirk's HITLER'S MADMAN ( and also Fritz Lang's HANGMEN ALSO DIE ) Hollywood showed how Heydrich was assassinated by Czech patriots , and how it led to hundreds of other deaths and the destruction of Lidice and other Czech towns . While neither of the two assassination films are flawless or correct in detail , they do capture the right approach to the subject matter . Put another way , of all the political assassination in World History , Heydrich's is the only one I think of immediately as more of an execution not an assassination . And as he suffered for several days after the attack , that is only fitting . Kenneth Branagh played Heydrich , who headed this conference at Wandesee Palace in 1941 . Germany was ( despite the failure of the Battle of Britain ) at the height of it's control of Europe , and it was determined to implement Hitler's intention of getting rid of the Jews . Hitler was clever enough never to put anything into formal writing ( such as orders ) on the subject ( a point that " Holacaust Deniers " seize upon to this day as " proof " that there was no " Holacaust " ) . Regretfully no records of the meeting were kept ( they were destroyed ) . But enough details came out to guess what happened . With his assistant , Adolf Eichmann ( Stanley Tucci here ) at his side , Heydrich got all the various heads of departments who were to organize the special trains , assist in the round-ups of the Jews , build the barely livable quarters for them at the camps , organize the camps , and set up the timetables , supply systems ( if for the victims you could call them that ) , and the work programs ( or slave programs , if you will ) that were to be used . Also the issue of whether to use poison gas on the Jews - was it cheaper or more expensive than bullets , and was it safer ( for the users ! ) . The wonderful thing about this film is the party and social backbiting involved . One of the officials is actually closer to Martin Bormann ( soon to be Hitler's new deputy ) than to Heydrich , and makes veiled allusions to Heydrich's possible Jewish ancestry . Eichmann looks at him , smiles , and says , " Why don't you say that to Herr Heydrich's face ? " The official shuts up . Eichmann himself has mixed feelings about his boss . At the end of the film we hear a piece of romantic German music that Heydrich put on the record player . Heydrich played the violin ( so did his father ) and saw himself as a man of culture . Eichmann looks at the record ( it's by Franz Schubert ) and disparages the piece . There are petty inter-departmental confrontations too . What soon becomes apparent is that these people are looking at the murder of millions of human beings as a math problem and how to solve it . And , with only one exception - who is rapidly silenced - none are looking or choose to look at the moral nightmare they are adopting . The conference ends with total agreement about implementing the plan . The plan did work - only cost six million Jews , and when extended seven million non-Jews more ! Heydrich ( as Branagh ) leaves the conference saying that when the war is finished he will return to do only wonderful things . Gee , he never had the chance to do so .
493136	3280905	56756	10.0	Bring Back the " Midget - Widgett " Motor Car Company	It lasted only one season , but FRACTURED FLICKERS was one of the funniest series ever put on television . The accounts given here on the thread are mostly lauding it , but I will add a few I recall . 1 ) A television history program that is pompously mis - announced as " FROM HYPOCRITES TO EINSTEIN . " Then a small , slightly timid voice - like the owner does not want to embarrass the announcer - stating , " That's " Hippocrates " . " The announcer , unfortunately sounding embarrassed , quickly says , " As I said , " FROM HIPPOCRATES TO EINSTEIN " . What followed was supposedly the story of various great events of the history of western man to be shown on this series , ending with the voice announcing , " and finally , and not least , that greatest moment in modern exploration : STANLEY AND LIVINGSTON .

He is the manufacturer of that remarkable automobile , " the Midget - Widgett " motor car ( which looks all of four feet in length ) . 3 ) The adventures ( narrated by the anti-hero ) of a high ranking Nazi officer ( Eric Von Stroheim ) hiding after the war - successfully for a time - as a ventriloquist , until betrayed by his dummy . 4 ) The story of the 20th Century's greatest predictor of the future - whose record is tarnished to all ( but the announcer , apparently ) by the fact that he never gets anything correct . I recall that at one point he is sent films of the German army in the field in 1914-15 and writes a letter to Kaiser Wilhelm II , stating that after viewing the film he is certain that victory is assuredly for Germany . He then sends the letter and the film home to Germany . . . on the Lusitania . 5 ) The story of the hitherto unknown fifth and youngest Kennedy brother , who is upset that his four older siblings ( including the dead Joe Jr . , apparently ) have outstripped him in prestige and public attention . So he takes his society friends with him from Hyannisport to the south seas , and hunts for a famous pirate treasure . And they find it too - unfortunately they are robbed of it at gunpoint by the villain : the sixth and youngest Rockefeller brother , upset that his five older siblings have outstripped him in prestige and public attention . It was consistently amusing , and had the added plus of Hans Conreid as it's host . I am glad that it is now out on DVD ( if the other comments on this thread are correct ) . Well worth watching indeed .
491912	3280905	50212	10.0	" Madness , Madness "	Let's face it - war is organized madness , and although the stakes in World War II were tremendous for whichever side lost , the individual effects of the war on the men and nations involved caused madness on several levels . Pierre Boule's short novel brilliantly discusses the madness in the crazy situation that sweeps up Colonels Nicholson and Saito . Under normal circumstances , the two men might never had been friends but they might have had a degree of respect for each other . Both come from nations that have long histories and traditions , and whose officer corps prided themselves on leadership and withstanding privations . The Japanese formalized these traditions in the code of Bushido ( which was twisted , unfortunately , in World War II ) . It included sharing privation with one's men and was similar to the concept of noblesse oblige that the aristocratic officers of Britain's army tried to maintain . Nicholson's stoicism when put into the isolation box was as much in his tradition as Saito's tradition would have included willingly reducing his own share of his rations for the benefit of his men in a siege . The situation that develops is a racial rivalry . The Japanese , in 1943 , have won so many of the campaigns , and witnessed the surrender of Allied ( i . e . Western - American , British , French , Dutch troops ) that they really have a contempt for them . As we now know was true , the Japanese soldiers frequently fought to the last man ( think of Saipan and Okinawa in the last stages of the war , where flame throwers were frequently used to force Japanese soldiers and civilians out into the open ) . Westerners could do this too , but traditionally the western states saw no shame in surrendering after putting up a hard fight . Not so the Japanese military . Saito is identifying with this tradition . In the novel , he is also disappointed that he is in charge of a prisoner of war camp - he'd prefer to be back in the fighting . But they need the prisoners to build the railroads throughout the new Japanese empire ( as mentioned on another comment , the " Greater East Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere " ) that can have men and material race from one end of the empire to the other . In reality this frequently ended up more like slave labor than what Boule arranges ( or what Saito probably had in mind ) . Nicholson insists on treatment under the Geneva convention for P . O . W . s , but Saito thinks it's typically Western and wimpish . As punishment for his presumption he puts Nicholson in a hellish underground cell in solitary . But Nicholson's men refuse to cooperate until he's released , and when he is he sneers at the Japanese engineers and their mistakes , and insists on the English army engineers taking control of the building - and this works well for the Japanese Army but not for Saito , who seriously feels like he has lost face and should commit suicide . Director David Lean wisely shot the film on location , capturing the heat and disorientation of a humid jungle war front . His wide screen film manages to make the locale of the prison camp and the Kwai River ( and the bridge ) look like it is the entire world , and that escape is impossible from it ( indeed the one man who escapes - Holden - has to return eventually ) . The novel does not include the character played by William Holden , one of his typically laconic Americans who retain a clear sightedness when compared to the British . Holden's " Shears " sees the prison camp as a massive graveyard ( he's on the burial detail ) and hates it to the point of escaping . He reaches safety in a recovery hospital in Ceylon , but he's forced by Jack Hawkins to return to the campsite to destroy the bridge . Hawkins ' too seems a realist - he is trying to destroy an enemy target that is nearly completed , and will make the enemy's war effort far easier . But his resolve to do this involves blackmailing Holden into assisting him , and forcing himself to continue on his mission after being seriously injured . At the end the mission kills hundreds of men . Hawkins has succeeded , but the local natives who assisted him look at him like he is a mass murderer . Guinness ' Nicholson is one of the most myopic soldiers in film ( or fiction for that matter ) totally forgetting the purpose of himself and his soldiers even in a P . O . W . situation but thinking solely in terms of oneupmanship and morale . It was a splendid performance . One might make a case that he behaved like a man who was hallucinating after an illness , and indeed he does ( accidentally ) get back to reality at the eleventh hour - too late to save himself , but in time to save his military honor . Sessue Hayakawa had a film career in Hollywood that went back to the silent period ( even appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in a Cecil B . DeMille movie ) , but the coming of sound and the deterioration of Japanese-American relations caused him to leave American movies . Like Swanson's sound comeback in Wilder's SUNSET BLVD . , Hayakawa's appearance as Saito , a harsh foe but ultimately sympathetic given his code of behavior and how he is humiliated , brought him belated recognition and an Oscar nomination . Finally there is James Douglas , a highly useful , plain looking British actor who frequently brought dollops of common sense to his films . His P . O . W . Major Clipton tries to rouse Nicholson's sense of reality , but fails ( in fact he soon sees that Nicholson's unreality is far more catching with the rest of the British P . O . W . s than he imagined ) . He sees natural foes , British and Japanese , joining together building a bridge of friendship in a time of war . And the final result is just destruction , confusion and death from that war . Is it any wonder that at the end , he mutters the two words in the " Summary Line " as the story's conclusion .
492438	3280905	80889	10.0	One of the Sharpest Late Cold War Comedies	After their success in HOUSECALLS ( 1978 ) Glenda Jackson and Walter Matthau got re teamed again in this marvelous spoof of the world of spies . Matthau has been one of the best trained CIA operatives in the field , but he is aware that the atmosphere where he blossomed is being tainted by a new chief - Ned Beatty . Beatty is ultra conservative politically ( Matthau's more easy-going ; witness his rivalry friendship with his opposite number Herbert Lom , the Russian KGB expert ) . Beatty is trying to force Matthau into line or to resign . So he transfer him to a meaningless desk job . Matthau decides that he has to get out of this dead end - and get out with a great deal of money . First , taking advantage of his still existent clearance , Matthau removes his personnel file from CIA headquarters . Then he goes underground , keeping in touch with only one person - Jackson , his old fellow agent and sometime girlfriend . While Beatty and Sam Waterston ( Matthau's friend , and the reluctant assistant to the hated Beatty ) try to find Matthau , the latter starts typing up his memoirs which will show the incompetence of certain figures ( i . e . Beatty ) in all the world's major police and intelligence services . He sends copies of the chapters to the publisher he has chosen , but also to Beatty , Lom , and several others . The revelations ( all protected by freedom of the press - the book is being published in England , and the English are not apparently one of the secret police groups targeted ) , make Beatty furious - and more determined than ever to find and silence Matthau . Unfortunately Matthau is so far superior to Beatty in brains and cunning that he runs circles around him . The best moment is when he manages to have the FBI destroy Beatty's summer house . Similarly Jackson does a number on one of Beatty's favorite acolytes , who is stupid enough to be trapped in her home when she has left - and left behind a large , mean Doberman Pincher . The film reaches a climax in England . Will Beatty and the reluctant Waterston catch Matthau , or will he continue making a monkey out of Beatty - or will he find the ultimate escape route ? It was a wonderful comedy . Unfortunately it would be the last that Jackson and Matthau made together .
491927	3280905	37415	10.0	Can an unseen presence physically threaten a human being ?	Without question THE UNINVITED is one of the finest ghost story movies that Hollywood has created . It does have flaws ( all motion pictures have flaws if you look for them ) , but the main portions of the film work . Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey are a pair of siblings from London , who are looking for a house in Cornwall . He wants to work on his music . They find a house that is on a cliff which is quite roomy and with a breathtaking vista - it is a dream place . But even as they examine it , they find that their pet cat is upset for no apparent reason . And Milland and Hussey find one room that was locked , open it , and while Hussey tries to find some nice things about it ( fitfully at best ) Milland finally just says it's dreadfully oppressive in there , and they slam the door . But the rest of the house is still tip-top and they decide to buy it . It's owner is the Commodore ( Donald Crisp ) . He's a stiff and crusty sort - not looking kindly on strangers . He does have one human being he cares for - his granddaughter Stella ( Gale Russell ) . Stella's mother died shortly after childbirth . Her father ( a painter ) has since died abroad . Crisp willingly sells the house to Milland and Hussey , but he is not totally happy . It seems Milland and Stella have struck up a friendship , which even under ordinary conditions Crisp would oppose ( after all , who are these Londoners ? ) , but what's worse is that they are inviting Russell up to their home . Crisp does not like this . Whenever Russell goes to the house , sooner or later she seems to drift to the edge of the cliff . Soon Milland and Hussey also note the odd behavior of Russell at the house , and they note too some other odd phenomenon - the sound of wailing and the smell of mimosa scent . Crisp getting increasingly upset at the situation tries to buy back the house at a profit for the siblings , but they refuse . They begin to probe the history of the house , and the tragedy involved with it , the previous owners , and Stella . In the meantime , Crisp sends Stella to a private sanitarium run by his daughter's closest friend ( Cornelia Otis Skinner ) , and hopes she will be safe from harm - particularly harm from uninvited evil spirits . I won't go into further detail than that . The film was well acted by the cast , including ( by the way ) Miss Skinner - who made very few film appearances in her career . There are elements in her performance and character that are more suggestive of lesbianism than was usual in 1944 . Similarly Russell's performance here ranks with her performance as John Wayne's Quaker girlfriend in ANGEL AND THE BADMAN as the two best in her sad career . Also of note , Alan Napier as the local doctor who gets involved ( and turns into a potential love interest for another character as well ) . And the song that Milland's character " composes " became a standard : " Stella By Starlight " . In short one excellent picture .
491968	3280905	32125	10.0	One Deeply Impressed Yank Gazing At Some Fragments	I have only seen about twenty to twenty five minutes of WHERE'S THAT FIRE ? on You Tube , but I will take a risk and say that if the rest of the film is like these chunks of it it must be extremely funny . Will Hay , Moore Marriot , and Graham Moffatt made six films together in the 1930s and 1940s and they are compared by most critics to be easily the equals of the Marx Brothers in the amounts their work generates laughter . Hay always played seedy figures of some authority , who is assisted ( or hampered ) by his two associates , Marriot ( an elderly ruin of a man , who somehow is always sharper than Hay , but still stupid ) and Moffatt ( a young fat fellow who is not impressed by Hay's authority and who has an intelligent form of insolence ) . Apparently there were copy-write problems in the release of WHERE'S THAT FIRE ? It was thought to be lost until the 1970s when it was shown on television . The version that seems to be currently on DVD is missing some of the initial scenes that starts the story . An oil refinery is on fire , and the fire departments for miles around are being called in to put it out . We see all these modern motorized ( for 1940 ) firehouses going out on the call . Finally we see the firehouse of our three heroes . The bell of the alarm has been muffled , and Marriott and Moffatt are playing checkers ( and Moffatt is making the mistake of taking Marriott's advice on his moves ) . Hay is Captain Viking , the fire chief of the town of Bishop's Wallop . Viking is an working on a foam to combat fire in place of water from hoses . He comes upstairs after another explosion of his concoctions , and then hears the phone ring . He answers and learns that everyone is wondering why they have not answered the alarm . Hay asks how long the alarm has been muffled . Moffatt tells him it has been that way since he had an attack of insomnia a week before and demanded it . The three ready their fire equipment ( a steam pumper pulled by a horse , and wear fire department uniforms that look like they date from 1880 ) . They press on to fight the fire - only to find in the end they not only drove fifteen away from the flames that were visible for twenty miles , but that a second fire destroyed the town hall at Bishop's Wallop . They are given one last chance by the town council , and proceed to try to modernize the firehouse . What follows is a twenty five minute laugh fest ( in two parts on You Tube ) where Hay , Marriott , and Moffatt struggle with a new fire-pole ( to slide down upon ) . Hay , typically , has put it wrong side up , and they have to take it out of the firehouse to somehow turn it around ( or such is their " logic " ) . As a result they cause a traffic jam outside , destroy the windows of several cars , scratch paint off other cars , destroy the bric-a-brac in a store , and cause a near riot . Also , annoying Hay because of superior brains , young Charles Hawtrey of " Carry On " fame , shows up trying to get them to use Euclidean Mathematics to solve the problem . At one point the pole is tilted sixty degrees across the street , pinning old Marriott in a chair by his belly ( a kindly lady asks if she can give him tea - he agrees when she doesn't have any brandy ) . Eventually first Moffatt and then Hay got into an apartment that may give them a way to pull the pole up out of the street . The apartment is Moffatt's father's ( he's in bed with a broken foot ) . When not eating grapes that are the father's lunch , Moffatt and Hay try to get the pole up alone and can't . Hay calls for assistance . So far it resembles some of the antics of Laurel and Hardy ( I'm thinking of TOWED IN THE HOLE ) or the Three Stooges ( remember Curly trying to use his extra pipe to stop a leak in the bathroom ? ) . Now it turns into an English version of the stateroom scene in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA , as twenty men come into the room to pull the pole up out of the street . They succeed - in fact they also pull up Marriott - but they break a glass sun light ( Hay tells Moffatt's father to watch the glass now in his bed ) . They have been stepping fairly frequently on the foot . Now comes the father's doctor who tries to reassure his frantic patient , while taking time for a puff on his pipe . Hays ' insane idea was to pull the pole to the roof , turn it around ( remember that was the original purpose of all this ! ) , and then go and slowly drop it into place in the firehouse . Great idea except there is nobody on the roof to hold it in place when it is pushed there . It topples over and crashes through the roof of Moffatt's father's apartment . If you can't see the film soon I urge you to watch the hijinks of the three You Tube sections I am reviewing . Apparently the plot twist is like that of OH MR . PORTER and ASK A POLICEMAN wherein the three idiots manage to somehow outsmart ( for want of a better term ) gangs of criminals or smugglers . Here the gang steals the antique fire engine in a plot to steal the Crown Jewels . The remainder of the movie ( including somehow making the fire horse ride vertically up the side of the Tower of London ) must be a pip . All I can say is you will not stop laughing .
493041	3280905	39661	10.0	Ty Power's Proof Of His Acting Ability	Tyrone Power came from a family of stage performers - even stage stars . His great grandfather was one of the best loved " Irish " comic actors of the Jacksonian Era in the 1820s - 1841 ( when his ship was lost at sea ) . His father was a prominent stage star , who came to Hollywood in the silent period , and appeared in John Wayne's first sound feature film . When Power himself began making films in the 1930s he was notable ( at 20th Century Fox ) for his remarkably good physical features . Power had a problem with Darryl Zanuck . Zanuck had him in 18th Century stories like " Lloyds Of London " and " Son Of Fury " and ( when lent to M . G . M . ) in " Marie Antoinette " . If they were closer in time to the 20th Century , they were in exotic locales - like " Blood And Sand " . As for westerns , Power was " Jesse James " and an early 19th Century Spanish - American fop in " The Mask Of Zorro " . Zanuck gave the best material to Power , who underestimated how really good his performances were in the costume / historical films . Occasionally Zanuck would allow Power to try a modern story he picked out . This was particularly the case after Power returned from his stint in the South Pacific in World War II . In 1946 Zanuck allowed Power to play Larry , the truth seeker and war survivor in " The Razor's Edge " . Based on a hit novel of Somerset Maugham , it was a hit film - but the hit was based more on the comic performance of Clifton Webb as snobbish Eliot Templeton , and the tragic brief performance ( and Oscar winner ) of Anne Baxter . Power was good , but the part was not well developed to explain what Larry discovered as the key to spirituality in India . Shortly after Power finished " The Razor's Edge " , he starred in " Nightmare Alley " . Based on a noir novel of the day , Power felt it would finally show his acting ability ( he actually need only have considered his performance in " The Black Swan " to have seen it was there all the time ) . Zanuck knew that Power generally listened to him , and that his roles could show a dark side ( as in Jesse James , and in his bullfighter in " Blood And Sand " ) . So he decided to let him go ahead with " Nightmare Alley " . Both turned out to be shown to be right . The film flopped at the box office , as people used to Power the hero saw Power the creep . But what a creep ! Stanton Carlyle is the greatest acting performance in Power's career , and ( more than " The Razor's Edge " ) it opened the second half of his film career , where the choices of subject were less frequently historic than in the earlier part . Zanuck made sure that Power got meaty acting parts , and Power was able to get into modern times . Carlyle has no redeeming features in him - a total opportunist he uses people right and left , making love to Zeena to learn her mentalist act - and killing her husband accidentally in the process - and also romancing Molly with no desire to do right by her . He rises from carnival worker to nightclub mentalist . Then he makes the mistake of joining forces with a psychiatrist , in an effort to go further - become a guru to the wealthy , using information from the psychiatrist to convince the rich that he has contact with the dead and the afterlife . Oddly enough if the discovery of Larry of spirituality in " The Razor's Edge " was never well explained , Stan Carlyle's clever fraud is very well explained . The others in the film are good , in particular Joan Blondell as Zeena , who gets a kick in the teeth from Stan on the way up , but shows him that he still is fated to fall . Colleen Grey's Molly is not as well developed ( why does she stick to the two-timing louse ? ) . Helen Walker's psychiatrist is very nicely sinister - springing a last minute trap on Stan that is unexpected . But note Mike Mazurki as the circus strong man Bruno . Mazurki usually played villains ( or comic toughs ) in films , but here he turns out to be smart and morally superior to Stan . It was a nice change of pace for this actor . The conclusion of the film was softened from the original novel , but even so it still gave Power an opportunity to show the total limits of his acting ability . However , he did not play another louse until the end of his career . Eleven years later his role as Leonard Vole in " Witness For The Prosecution " gave him his second real villain part .
491964	3280905	14702	10.0	Better than the 1954 Version	This was a special treat tonight on the Turner Classic Films Channel as they were honoring John Barrymore . Barrymore appeared in this 1924 silent film , which has only just gotten a complete score for the first time since it was released ( the score was quite good - ironically a British version of the Fitch play had a complete score that only one piece , a very sturdy little minuet , survives - but it would have been good too , as it was by Sir Edward Elgar ) . The play by Fitch is rarely shown today ( as I have mentioned elsewhere on this board , Fitch is a little old fashioned by some standards but his plays do pick up life when performed ) . This play was commissioned by the reigning stage star of the 1890s in America , Richard Mansfield . Best remembered for his transformation part of DR . JECKYL AND MR . HYDE in 1887 , Mansfield would eventually help speed the modernization of drama by championing the early plays of George Bernard Shaw ( who rewrote THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE for him ) . Mansfield died in 1909 , and the film producers needed the permission of his wife to produce this filmed version . The effect of Mansfield on this production must be immense . Stills of his costumes for Brummel still exist , and match the costumes worn by Barrymore ( who may have seen the older actor in the role in the 1890s ) . The plot follows how Brummel , a young army Captain , loved Margery ( Mary Astor ) , who was forced to marry Col . Lord Alvanley ( William Humphrey ) . Made cynical by the way he was forced to drop his competition for the woman who loved him , Brummel decides to pay back society by purposely poking fun at it's leaders as a social butterfly . By chance and nerve he becomes a favorite of George , Prince of Wales , getting him out of a ticklish situation with the wife of a tavern owner . He leaves the army and becomes the Prince's closest friend and confidante . This leads to Brummel actually being useful - with the fashion conscious ( if grossly overweight ) Prince , they modify the costumes and dress of the society , encouraging top hats , cravats , frock coats , and pants and doing away with wigs . But Brummel becomes more and more cynical in his treatment of the Prince , and eventually they reach a parting of the ways when Brummel seems to be romancing George's sister-in-law Frederica , Duchess of York ( Irene Rich ) , and then when Margery returns and the Prince falls for her . Further divisions are heightened by enemies that Brummel made including discarded lover Lady Hester Stanhope ( Carmel Myers ) . In the end , deserted by George and other friends , Brummel flees his creditors and ends in Calais , where he goes broke slowly , and eventually loses his mind . The 1954 Granger film followed a similar trajectory , with one or two major errors that weaken it in comparison . Fitch concentrated his play as a character study of a fascinating flawed man , in a losing game with the social order of his day . The 1954 film suggested that Brummel was politically a liberal , who could have influenced George to be a Whig in his politics ( which was not possible actually - George toyed with Whigs like Charles Fox to annoy his father George III , but was a total reactionary who made George III look wimpy in comparison ) . In this film the Duchess of York suggests that Brummel should not be a court jester as he is , but should be a leader . Barrymore shakes his head - he has no such desires . That is more in line with the real Brummel . The other major error ( in line with a politicized Brummel ) was that the 1954 film showed the odd situation in England in the period from 1807 to 1820 when George III went mad for the last ( and permanent ) time , and the Prince of Wales was made Prince Regent ( in 1811 ) - which was de facto King of England while George III was alive and crazy . Robert Morley played George III in the 1954 film , at one point nearly killing the Prince of Wales ( Peter Ustinov ) . This is not in the 1924 film . Instead the story concentrates on the rise and fall of Brummel . Barrymore does well in silent acting . Perhaps the director , Henry Beaumont , made too many shots of Barrymore's great profile , but that was to be expected . He manages to show the actor in him , especially in scenes with his three leading ladies ( especially the 18 year old Astor and Ms Rich ) . His aging and insanity sequences are also good - look at the scene where he has just fired his last loyal servant ( who had the temerity to beg forgiveness for him from the new King George IV ) and now has to serve himself dinner . He's never done it , and the look of dismay on his face is priceless . His aged madman , at the conclusion of the film , is also remarkable - getting so much out of the use of his eyes . Definitely a superior version of the film to the Granger version , even if the latter was in color and with sound .
493377	3280905	27800	10.0	A Hodgepodge Science Fiction - Horror Film That Works Well	Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi made many films together , but on the whole ( interestingly enough ) Karloff usually is the better man of the two . The real exception is " The Black Cat " ( 1934 ) where Karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult , and Lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life . But more usual is " Black Friday " , where ( whatever his motive ) Karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while Lugosi is a murderous thug . In " The Raven " Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon , who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough . Rarely are they both negative characters totally . In " The Body Snatcher " , Karloff does kill Lugosi , but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him . The one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film , which I feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies I have mentioned . In it Karloff's Dr . Janos Rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the " official scientific community " for his theory that a rare form of Radium is in Nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago . He has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens ( Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi ) , and has another scientist , a Frenchman named Dr . Felix Benet ( Lugosi ) , Rukh's young wife Diane ( Frances Drake ) and a friend and prot√©g√©e of the Stevenses named Ronald Drake ( Frank Lawton ) . Before they leave , Rukh is warned by his mother ( Violet Kemble Cooper ) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy . He tries to dismiss this , but he is worried by what she says , his scientific standing , and whether or not he is going to get his due credit . What he gets is a disaster . He finds the substance , but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity . He finds that he is slowly burning up , and if he tries to touch people or animals they die . He's actually built up a friendship or understanding with Benet , who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for Rukh to use to counter the danger . But there are two things that are unbeatable here . The antidote can only last for a certain amount of time , and has to be replenished . And the radioactivity has affected Rukh's brain . He is increasingly jealous of Diane's friendship with Ronald ( encouraged , unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella ) , and he is equally upset that ( due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that ) Benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that " Radium X " is giving to man . Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives , ending with his own . The film certainly picked up on science to an extent . Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium . Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 , but some idea of it was coming out . The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a " curse " on the expedition . Of course , with the idea of a " cursed " expedition ( on the continent of Africa ) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago , financed by a titled Englishman , we have entered archeology not physics or geology ( paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon ) . On the other hand , Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths , and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England . During the Whitechapel Murders , Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper . It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes . But the idea did not die . Jules Verne used it in his novel " The Brothers Kip " in 1899 , and here Dr . Benet uses it . As this is a science fiction story , he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate , but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters . The film is good on many grounds , the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other . There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films . The other performances are good as well , in particular Ms Kemble Cooper . She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone's frightening sister ( Jane Murdstone ) in " David Copperfield " . Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end , and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target .
492736	3280905	54866	10.0	Dreams that turn to volcanic ash	In the early 1930s Marcel Pagnol wrote a series of plays concerning the intertwined lives of a set of characters in the city of Marseilles . The plays were each centered on a chief character : FANNY , MARIUS , and CESAR . Fanny is the daughter of a fishmonger Honorine , and has grown up with Marius , the son of Cesar a caf√© owner . Cesar is a neighbor and friend of Panisse , a wealthy businessman . Marius has grown handsome and Fanny is pretty , and they are in love . But Marius has a wanderlust , encouraged by a local figure " the Admiral " . So when he reaches the age of 19 he is confronted by a dilemma . He is about to present his sailors papers to a sea captain , but he is also jealous of anyone who is trying to attract Fanny , especially the elderly Panisse . But the lure of the sea is too much , and after a final evening with Fanny in which they admit their love for each other ( and have a sexual encounter ) , Marius flees with the boat . A couple of months later Fanny finds she is pregnant . Taking advantage of Panisse's offer of marriage ( although he is aware of her situation ) , Fanny marries the elderly suitor . This enables her child ( a son ) to be born legitimately ( and to allow the Panisse family not to die out ) . But Marius ( when he returns - disillusioned by the non-romantic trip abroad ( his comment about south-sea islands is the basis of the " summary line " above ) finds he has lost Fanny and his son , and cannot even return to living at his old home . The resolution is the subject of the third play . Aside from the success of the trilogy of French films , the story was made into a successful Broadway musical called FANNY with Florence Henderson in the title part and with Ezio Pinza as Cesar . This 1961 film version does not use any of the songs from the score , but it does use the themes of the score for the background music . This version by Joshua Logan has Leslie Caron in the title role , Horst Buchholz as Marius , Charles Boyer as Cesar , Maurice Chevalier as Panisse , and Georgette Anyss as Honorine . All of the performances are good , with moments that make the characters quite human ( Boyer yelling at Marius or some other employee in his caf√© about their not making a particular drink correctly , or Anyss returning to the waterfront , years after she has moved to Panisse's country house , and realizing how much she has missed the smell of the fish she used to sell ) . The story is actually quite human and humane too , not only in the situation facing the unwed Fanny and Panisse's willingness to help her preserve her reputation and his family line , but also in the resolution ( again handled by Panisse , as he is dying ) to restore normality to the young people . It is not a perfect film , but it certainly is well photographed in Marseilles ( including some shots of the notorious Ch√¢teau D'if of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ) , and gives us a view of France in the early 1930s , before the onrush of European events led to the disastrous defeat of 1940 . Note also , besides the leads , the support by Lionel Jeffreys ( as an English friend of Panisse and Cesar ) and Salvatore Baccaloni as intimates of the families , who join Boyer and Chevalier in playing pranks on passersby ( with a hat - you'll have to see it to understand ) . I'm even glad to see Victor Francen in one of his last movie roles , as Panisse's older brother - thanking Fanny for saving the family name . Boyer and Chevalier had never worked on a film together before ( unlike Chevalier and Caron in GIGI ) , and now got to know each other . It did help as they seem to blend together quite nicely in several comic confrontation scenes . Boyer would come to chat with Chevalier when neither was needed on the set , and they were in their trailers . Here Boyer did find one unsettling habit of Chevalier . Chevalier had been rather poor as a young man , and his habits of thrift remained with him as an elderly one . Boyer was quietly appalled to find that if they were having a glass of Chevalier's wine the entertainer would cut a groove into the bottle at a certain point with a ring . No wine would be poured below that groove mark .
492346	3280905	29992	10.0	" Mankind was my business ! "	Although I favor the versions of this story with Alistair Sim or with George C . Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge ( and I have not had the luck to see the surviving version with Sir Seymour Hicks ) , I like this one too . It gave an opportunity ( a rare one ) to one of Hollywood's best character actors to have the central role in a film for a change . The only other film with Reginald Owen as the star is ( interestingly enough ) when he played Sherlock Holmes in " A Study In Scarlet " earlier in the 1930s . Owen was good in an inferior film ( certainly a bad retelling of that novel ) . Owen was usually good though , be he playing comic parts ( see him in " Petticoat Fever " ) , or in dramatic parts ( his vicious and opportunistic Alaskan prospector / thief in the 1935 " Call Of The Wild " ) . He had a long career too , even playing a " Commidore Schmidlapp " in the film version of " Batman " with Adam West and Burt Ward in the late 1960s . If Sim made Scrooge a neurotic , and Scott an opportunistic stock jobber , and Albert Finney a nasty , people-hating usurer , Scrooge is a tight fisted businessman who never looses anything . He knows how much is spent in his premises ( note how Owen , as he enters the offices , senses too much heat and glares at the fireplace , while poor Bob Cratchit ( Gene Lockhart ) scurries over to take out those two valuable pieces of coal he momentarily added ) . He is also constantly saving everything : His nephew Fred ( Barry Mackay ) brought a bottle of port wine to the office that he gave to Bob , who took a drink . After Crachit leaves , Owen is about to throw out the bottle , realizes that it has been barely touched , and takes it home with him . Later he will take some cough medicine at home , and after doing so he will lick his fingers as not to lose any drops of the medicine . He also disgusts a waiter ( Henry Cording ) who has just served him a cheap meal when he insists on biting a coin to see if it is good . The versions of " A Christmas Carol " always pick and choose items to develop from the story or to drop . They all stick to the main trajectory ( introduce Scrooge and the Cratchits and Fred and his fianc√© , Scrooge goes home and is visited by Marley and the ghosts , Scrooge sees his past - usually the public school and his sister's visit , and the Fezziwigs dance party - then sees his present - the Cratchits and Fred with their family and friends - and then sees the possible future - the death of Tiny Tim ( Terry Kilbride in this film ) and Scrooge's unlamented death ; the trajectory is completed by some version of Scrooge's reformation bearing Christmas joy to all who he formerly denied it too . It's pick and choose . The section with the Ghost of Christmas Past ( Anne Rutherford ) ends before we see Scrooge's descent into pure greed and selfishness ( and there is no reference to his love affair with Fezziwig's daughter ) . The section with the Ghost of Christmas Present ( Lionel Braham ) shows the ghost settling some trivial street quarrels with his horn of Christmas " cheer " , and he does get in the jab about " Tiny Tim " should die to decrease the surplus population ( a reference to Scrooge's earlier thoughtless comment ) . But he does not show the two waifs that under his robe representing " want " and " fear " . The ghost of Christmas to Come remains silent . . . as the tomb ( as Dickens wanted him to be . [ Only once , when Disney did a version with " Scrooge McDuck " ( Alan Young ) in a cartoon did the third ghost speak . It turned out to be the old Disney villain , Pegleg Pete , and he gleefully pushes McDuck into the grave after telling him off . ] The additions here include a running series of scenes concerning ice sliding that involves the street urchins , Fred and his fianc√© , and even the local Minister ( Halliwell Hobbs ) . Also Crachitt loses his job here when he accidentally selects Scrooge for the target of his snowball . ( Scrooge charges him the whole of his last week's pay , and an additional shilling for the cost of a new hat ) . The film tries to keep the design in line with the illustrations by Cruikshank ( Fezziwig even has an 18th Century wig on ) . Owen does reawaken as he recalls the joys he's pushed aside and sacrificed . His make-up here resembles a little his villain from the 1936 " Trouble For Two " , who was also nearly completely bald . Lockhart adds troubled tension to his role , knowing he will only have one week of work left ( unpaid ! ) after this . It's nice to see that here one of Cratchit's children is played by Lockhart's real life daughter June . All in all a delightful version , if somehow not as meaty as the others that I like .
491825	3280905	39477	10.0	Fear Is Your Foreman !	Clark Gable made several comedies in his career , some of them quite funny ( such as TEACHER'S PET ) . THE HUCKSTERS was one of the funny ones that still retains it's edge . It is considered dated by some because advertising is taken for granted in the modern day world , but if you consider that mass advertising actually goes back to the newspaper and magazine explosion of the late 19th Century THE HUCKSTERS was only bringing the story up to date in post World War II America . What sets this film above other attacks is the acting of Gable , Adolphe Menjou , Ava Gardner , Keenan Wynn , Edward Arnold , and ( best of the group ) Sidney Greenstreet as the evil Evan LLewellyn Evans , the soap king . The film does look closely at the running of the advertising world inside an ad firm - quite a different look from the normal in any Hollywood film up to that time . Basically the film shows how everyone jumps to the tune of the rich client ( here the manipulative and sadistic Greenstreet ) . Gable has some values , and he slowly is corrupted sufficiently by dealing with Evans and Menjou to drop them . The key scene is when he blackmails Edward Arnold to do something unethical . Subsequently we realize that this never sits well with Gable , as Arnold's character in this film ( for a change ) is a rather decent guy . It does lead to his final act of independence - one of the best moments in Gable's and Greenstreet's film careers . Keenan Wynn has always been underrated . He was a very good dramatic actor ( witness his performance in THE GREAT MAN ) and very amusing as a comedian ( as in MY DEAR SECRETARY and DR . STRANGELOVE - two different approaches to comedy by the way ) . His father was Ed Wynn , one of the great Broadway clowns of all time . It is easy to see how he got his sense of timing . But what makes his role here as Buddy Hare , the second rate comic that Mr . Evans thinks is the funniest man in the world , is he is dealing with a man who has weak material to begin with , and delivers it with gusto that we can't stand hearing . Witness the joke about a man painting the front door of Buddy's home with black paint , and Gable's Vic Norman drops the obvious punchline on him . Eddie smiles weakly acknowledging that it is bad material . This is done so well , we end up liking Eddie ( even if we wish he'd take his material and go away ) .
493260	3280905	32152	10.0	That threatened ride on a buzz saw	It is true that Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy were far more effective in their national audience on radio than in the movies . This was due to the close-up affect of cinematography on Bergen's face - he could not hide the fact that his lips moved a little . When on a stage in a nightclub or in vaudeville he'd be too far away to be seen moving his lips . Not so on film . But Bergan and McCarthy put ventriloquism on the map . Their act and radio show took the art of throwing one's voice and brought a biting humor to it , giving the dummy a real personality : a wise guy little man , with an eye for the ladies and an eye for making trouble for people he did not like ( among whom was Fields ) . The feud of McCarthy and Fields mirrored the contemporary feud of Fred Allan and Jack Benny , except that Allan and Benny were both real . But on radio Charlie was as real as " Uncle Claude " was , so the fact that it was a block of wood that was manipulated fighting a real life man did not matter . The public just loved Charlie reminding Fields of his alcoholism , in particular his large red nose . And the public loved the threats of Fields to give Charlie a ride on a buzz saw . Because of the strong personality of McCarthy , a movie audience even today looks at this film and tends to ignore Bergen's slight lip movements . Charlie is the real personality of interest , not Edgar - here playing a hard working young man who would like to marry Vicki Whipsnade ( Constance Moore ) but is resigned that she wants to marry a wealthy young wastrel instead . Bergen could act ( look at his performance in I REMEMBER MAMA , as Ellen Corby's boyfriend / husband , and his comic scene there with Oskar Homolka regarding the dowry ) . But he did not have to act as Bergen here - all he had to do was let Charlie do his job ( and , for that matter , let Mortimer Snerd do his work too in two scenes ) . The tricks used by the director to have scenes where Charlie appears without Bergan are just even more effective , as they enhance the idea of an independent comic personality coming out of the dummy . For Fields there are many choice moments too . His walk , supposedly naked after a shower , across the circus grounds - hidden behind people carrying items , or elephants and other animals , until a lady screams and faints ( and Fields is finally physically revealed to the audience ) is a gem . So is his wrecking the Bel-Goodies engagement party , first by his mad ping pong match , and then by his insistence of telling the story of how his life was saved once by an intelligent rattlesnake ( not realizing that Mrs . Bel-Goody hates even the mention of snakes ) . His interactions with the circus staff , with the idiotic Grady Sutton , with labor union organizer Edward Brophy , and with the various people buying tickets for the circus , or for that matter mispronouncing his name as " Larceny Whipsnake " are priceless . So is his own attempt at ventriloquism : he does it so you can't see his lips move , but you just can't believe he is throwing his voice . Well he is throwing dust or something else at that moment . But it is his running confrontations with McCarthy , some of which he actually loses ( he has one where he has to bribe Charlie at one point to keep quiet ) that maintains the audience's attention . The film is one of Fields ' best ones , and deservedly retains it's popularity to this day .
493425	3280905	162222	10.0	A Modern " Robinson Crusoe " & " Enoch Arden " Story - Before " Lost "	Tom Hanks movie career has been one of the best things to emerge out of television acting in the last half century . He rarely if ever disappoints . CAST AWAY is one of his best performances - a tour-de-force one man show for most of the movies time on screen . Hanks is Chuck Nolan , an executive official at FED EX , who seems to have everything going for him . He has a grueling but interesting and successful career in business , with many friends , and he is having a really hot and heavy romance with Kelly Frears ( Helen Hunt ) , which is likely to end up in marriage . But he is sent on a business trip , like so many others , and the plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean . Although there were five men on the Fed Ex plane , only Hanks is lucky enough to get into a life raft with any supplies or provisions . Eventually he reaches a deserted island . If you read the novel by Daniel DeFoe , Crusoe slowly builds upon his own knowledge of how to survive to make his island a fairly comfortable place to live on - despite the threats of cannibals . But DeFoe gave Crusoe one thing that Nolan does not get . DeFoe gives his survivor a companion : Friday . There is no loneliness on Crusoe's island . Nolan does not have such luck . He has to create even his companion : a volleyball with a painted face on it named " Wilson " , whom he talks to when he is trying to do anything ( and Nolan has to do everything , including rediscover fire ) . It's a crushing situation , and leads to depression and some dark thoughts . But Nolan is one determined man - somehow he will get off that island , if for no other reason than that he wants to return to civilization , and best of all to Frears . It is the photograph of Frears that keeps Nolan's sanity together in that long , lonely vigil on the island . So he finds a cave to live in in the island's rocks , to keep relatively warm and dry in the rain . He does rediscover fire . He does keep a fairly good track of time . He even performs ( in one of the most grueling moments of the film ) oral surgery on a painful tooth that you have to see to believe . SPOILER AHEAD : He does get off the island in the end - but finds his problems just as difficult to solve off the island as it was on the island .
492607	3280905	60445	10.0	When the best laid plans don't get off the ground . . .	Any film with Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine has real potential for being delightful . Add to it Herbert Lom as a powerful , but not really bad fellow for a change , and it is headed for being terrific . What carries it to the top is it's sense of spoofing . For GAMBIT came at the end of the first sequence of crime movies where a scheme for the big robbery or whatever was the crime involved was carefully , step by step , explained to the audience as it was done . The best known of these films were THE ASPHALT JUNGLE , RIFFIFI , TOPKAPI , THE KILLING , OCEAN'S ELEVEN ( the original one with Frank Sinatra ) . Normally the schemes are flawlessly carried out , but some small error blows the game away ( such as THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN or THE LAVENDER HILL MOB ) , or there are internecine jealousies that destroy the plan ( RIFFIFI , THE ASPHALT JUNGLE ) , or outsiders destroy the plan ( THE KILLING , OCEAN'S ELEVEN ) . But GAMBIT changes this deliciously . The movie is actually two films , one about thirty minutes long ( interesting but mechanical ) and the other about eighty minutes long which makes a total hash of the initial film . We see Caine and his partner , John Abbott , looking at Maclaine in the dance hall / bar she works at . She is important for some reason tied to her face . Soon after hiring her , they show her a file on the life of Shabandar ( Lom ) the world's richest man living in a country like Indonesia or Malaysia . He is a lonely man , ever since his one beloved wife died some twenty five years before - and she resembled Maclaine . They head for the city that Shabandar lives in , planning to check into the hotel that is his home and headquarters , as aristocrats . They know his secret police will bring Maclaine's appearance to Lom's attention . He is fascinated by her , and takes her out to dinner , while Caine explains he has to await for some phone calls . You see him doing some robbery in Lom's apartment ( which is electronically protected - but he is able to handle that ) , to get at a rare ancient bust of a princess ( which looks like the late Mrs . Shabandar and Maclaine ) . At a given timed moment , she excuses herself to go to the powder room , leaving her bag behind to allay suspicion , but gets a cab , which picks up Caine at the hotel , and takes them to the airport where they leave for London . And that half hour gives the whole scheme . As Caine explains it to Abbott it is perfect . Not a seam in it . Soon the seams begin to be shown here . First off , Caine imagines Maclaine is putty in his hand , doing what he wants without any questions . From the start she is nothing but asking questions . This drives him crazy , like when she questions whether Lom can be the richest man in the world or not ( Caine shouts back , in desperation , " OKAY , HE'S NOT THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD . . . HE'S THE FIFTH OR THE FOURTEENTH ! WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER ! ! " ) It still would not be totally off-centered if Caine , in his research , had been more careful . Lom ( as typical for Herbert Lom ) is an exceptionally smart guy - and very modern . He later explains to a bemused Caine that years before he allowed his inner sanctum to be invaded by a reporter and photographer , and had dressed up like a religious Mohammadan , but that was just window dressing . Since Caine has based his scheme on the information from that same article , one can imagine his feelings . Even Abbott , who plays a small part in the robbery plans , has problems . He is supposed to call Caine " to tell him that he has to call back that night " , to give added details for the sake of a naturally suspicious Lom . But instead of using a specific pay phone as planned , Abbott can't even get into the phone booth because of a belligerent local man who is angrily making a telephone call . As you can see from these examples , the second movie ( the eighty minutes following the opening ) is like a guide book to why planning can only be a failure . It is a welcome antidote to the idiotic flawless plans that are at the center of the other films . And the three leads ( four with Abbott ) are enjoying the joke . The film is not will the plan be a success , but will it succeed despite the flaws that nobody even thought could arise . Only in the Sinatra OCEAN'S ELEVEN was there a similar sense of fun - as the Rat Pack realizes the inanity of the film plot ( there robbing the Vegas casinos on one night ) with the lights of Dino , Sammy , Frank , Joey , and the others working with precision when they'd prefer being drunk . Here Caine and Maclaine try to keep to an impossible time table and scheme after realizing they are not dealing with a tradition bound millionaire but one who fully likes using anti-burglary devices based on modern electronics . Yet they do manage to get done in time , for the double ( possibly triple ) surprise at the conclusions of the movie . An absolute joy ( particularly seeing Lom being really pleasant for most of the film - except for one moment , but it passes quite quickly ) . It certainly deserves the kudos it has received as a first rate adventure comedy
492558	3280905	24184	10.0	To make the world grovel at his feet .	Spoiler ahead - a well known one though . It was his first major film role , and he only appeared at the tale end of the movie for a minute - as a corpse ! But Claude Rains was made as of that moment , though it would be awhile before he actually ceased being a villain in all of his films . James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN is possibly the best of the early Universal horror series of the 1930s . FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula ( both English and Spanish versions ) are great films too , but the threat of Jack Griffin's discovery of invisibility makes the other two seem quaint as threats . One can run from Frankenstein , and one can stay indoors at night with a handy cross or garlic available . But how does one fully protect oneself against someone who is physically strong , mentally smart , and totally determined to kill you if you cannot see him ? It's not easy , especially if the goal of this monster is to rule over others . As he puts it , he wishes to have the world grovel at his feet . In the novel , Griffin's personality is shown to be so selfish from the start that one can tell that no matter what discovery he would have made he would have misused it for power . He has no redeeming features at all . However , his omnipotence is sort of curbed in one way that is not the case in the film . A character is invented by Wells ( who is not in the movie ) that Griffin frightens into serving as a slave or servant . The character manages to run off with Griffin's chemistry lab and chemicals , as well as Griffin's notebooks . As a result he is trapped in his invisibility , and can't get out of this situation until the novel ends . The film does have some classic moments of humor ( Whale liked to add black humor to his films ) . When a woman runs screaming down the lane at night followed by an empty pair of pants skipping along reciting " here we go gathering nuts in May " is one . So ( more darkly ) is during a massive search for Griffin , after he causes a train disaster . One of the volunteers , slightly apart from the others , is grabbed and thrown down and choked . Rains / Griffin , in speaking , says , " Here I am . . . AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU FOUND ME ? ! ! " It is a chilling moment . A wonderful blend of thrills and comedy , surrounding a science fiction tale of constant interest , this film never disappoints . I give it a 10 for entertainment value . For helping awaken viewers to reading the works of Herbert George Wells , I'd give it a 12 .
492059	3280905	29947	10.0	" You throw an olive upward and I end up sitting on my hat ! Why does that sound normal to me ? "	Because of its box office failure after one or two other films a bunch of " expert " movie house owners called Katherine Hepburn " Box Office Poison " on a notorious list in the late 1930s . Fred Astaire and Marlene Dietrich were also on that list . One would love to know what other " great " prognostications and viewpoints this bunch of yokels made over the years . Did they predict Dewey would beat Truman too ? Or that Sputnick proved the Russians would land on the moon first ? I only hope that they ended up being laughed into oblivion by their families and friends . For " Bringing Up Baby " was one of the funniest movies of the 1930s . It is not flawless - the Katherine Hepburn character is the supreme example of the spoiled madcap heiress of the genre of madcap comedies of the 1930s . And she certainly gives the viewers much to laugh at , such as her impossible readiness to steal objects from golf balls to automobiles , or to try to wake sleeping people up by throwing pebbles at a window , or trying to calm a leopard down from the roof by singing with Cary Grant , " I Can Give You Anything But Love " . In no other comedy she made is Hepburn so ditsy . But the behavior of Hepburn is the sole problem of the film . She does such a number of things to keep Grant under her control while she derails his marriage plans that she almost makes the viewers dislike her . But Grant is such a dud personality from the start of the film that one can understand why she has such an easy time pulling him around . Howard Hawks made several comedies with Grant , most notably " His Gal Friday " . But in two of them Grant plays men who each end up being a yo-yo for the women who love them . The other one is " I Was A Male War Bride " , where Hawks paired Grant with Anne Sheridan , and puts him through a series of humiliations that go all the way to the conclusion . Both are equally funny films , but both are set in their times , one a peacetime film the other a post-war comedy . But the conclusion of " Bringing Up Baby " is more memorable - when the life's work of Grant , the anthropologist , is shattered . The fall of the brontosaurus ( again caused by Hepburn ) is so famous that it was reused in " On The Town " ( early in that film ) when Jules Munshin knocks down a similar brontosaurus . Here we watch David Huxley ( Grant ) plans to get a million dollars for his museum and his plans to marry his assistant Alice Swallow ( Virginia Walker ) go down the tubes from his constant collisions with the easy going but determined Susan Vance ( Hepburn ) first on a golf course , then at a restaurant ( she causes him to fall by trying to catch an olive which he trips on - see the " summary line " ) , to her apartment ( where he meets her new pet leopard , " Baby " ) , to her shanghaiing him to Connecticut . In the end he has to wear a woman's robe ( shocking Hepburn's dowager aunt May Robson ) , pretend he is an insane big game hunter named Bone ( and get bored by tales of big game hunting from Charlie Ruggles ) , dig up a lot of the estate looking for a dinosaur tail bone , wrestle one leopard and release a second one , and deal with a somewhat confused town constable ( Walter Catlett in a lovely absent minded performance ) and an " understanding " psychiatrist ( Fritz Feld ) . The film works despite being really a series of loosely tied together events . They flow from one to another , but due to the standard of lunacy involved the chunks of the film remain in our memories rather than the connecting links . But those are truly golden chunks , and make the viewers simply want to see more . This film is a real keeper for any fan to want to watch .
492063	3280905	85252	10.0	The Feud Nobody Really Won	It will be the irony of Robert Blake's decent acting career that despite his stint as Baretta in the Detective Series , his personal life will make people think only of his negative - villainous characters , as in his best performance IN COLD BLOOD and as Jimmy Hoffa in BLOOD FEUD . Fortunately , Blake was such a good performer that his performances in both roles are worthy of being remembered . It's just a pity about his hero parts . James R . Hoffa will remain ( to most Americans ) one of the most despicable figures in the history of our labor unions . There have been other crooked union leaders before and since , but Hoffa is the extreme example , because his Teamster's Union was one of the best run and richest unions , and giving tens of millions of dollars from the pension funds to the Mob for their activities . On the other hand , if you speak to Teamsters , even if they admit Hoffa's failings , they will point out that he was a remarkable figure in improving wages and benefits , and in actually nearly achieving the dream of all union leaders : Hoffa nearly created a NATIONAL contract for teamsters in this country . If he had been honest and achieved these things , say like Gompers or Powderly or Green or Lewis or Reuther , he would have been considered a great man . Instead he is forever a fascinating but twisted figure . This film discussed the confrontation beginning in the 1950s between Hoffa and Robert Kennedy , first as an attorney working for the Congressional Committees investigating the union , and later as his brother's Attorney General . There had actually been some impressive work earlier - the corrupt Union Head Dave Beck had been convicted by the Government and sent to prison . Ironically the election of Hoffa was greeted as a new broom sweeping clean . Actually it was more like changing leaders from a common thief to an uncommonly brilliant one . In the film Blake plays Hoffa as an intensely intelligent individual , but one who could get emotionally involved to his detriment . Had Hoffa been cooler he possibly might have beaten Kennedy's assault . But Kennedy ( here played very competently as a competitive person by Cotter Smith ) found that he did not like being defeated at every turn by the Union leader's maneuvers . Possibly had he been cooler he might have noticed that despite the level of corruption there was evidence that Hoffa was actually achieving much for his rank and file . In short two amazing men with huge egos turned a government probe into a gladiatorial contest . The key to Hoffa's fall was one of his lower level Union leaders , the head of the New Orleans Local Eddie Partin ( Brian Dennehy in a fine performance as a man torn by loyalties who turns on his closest friend Hoffa for his own safety ) . Partin produced the evidence of malfeasance that Kennedy used to prod Hoffa out of his position of power . The end result of all this was mixed - and did not do good for the powers that be . Hoffa became a liability for the mob , because they knew RFK would start on them in the second administration of his brother . And the film does strongly suggest that this may be the reason for JFK's assassination , as the Mob realized Bobbie would not be able to retain his Attorney General position long under his personal political enemy Lyndon Johnson ( Forrest Tucker , shown to good affect but not as much as one would like as a man who dislikes being high-hatted by the snobby Kennedy boys ) . Still Johnson kept Bobbie in his position until Hoffa was found guilty of stealing from the union . But his fall from power doesn't end there . In the film , Blake's Hoffa still has contacts with the Mob even as he is headed for prison . And he hears things . The film ends in June 1968 , with Bobbie in the hotel in Los Angeles looking forward to the Democratic National Convention . Suddenly there is a phone call , and it is from Hoffa . The latter is about to start his prison term , and feels obligated to warn Kennedy about possible threats . Kennedy won't listen , but Hoffa ( if this is true ) suggests that maybe at this point they should work together for their own safety . Kennedy , somewhat bemused by the phone call , vaguely says he'll have to think about it . After the phone call ends an aide asks if he really feels there is a physical threat from the Mob . RFK shakes his head , and quotes the poem by Robert Frost , that he has " miles to go before I sleep . " Then he heads downstairs for the speech of victory he gave regarding the California primary . The film worked very well , with a cast of highly competent character actors . Whether Hoffa really tried to reach an accord with RFK I cannot say , but their duel certainly did neither very much good . And the Teamster's Union has taken decades to recover .
492016	3280905	100405	10.0	Princess Vivian and Prince Edward Save Each Other	The economic monsters of the 1980s and 1990s included vast corporate take-overs for the purpose of the selling off of corporate assets . Frequently the assets separately were more valuable than the corporate whole . That this lead to economic dislocation for the employees of the corporations rarely was considered by the men who planned and carried out the raids and takeovers . Three films really got involved in this matter . They were WALL STREET , wherein " Gordon Gecko " ( Michael Douglas ) told an audience of stockholders that " greed is good " and that it might even save the United States ! A more balanced version was presented by Danny DeVito as " Larry the Liquidator " in OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY . Then came this nice little fairy tale , mixing the world of Cinderella with the world of Dow Jones and some Freud . PRETTY WOMEN is probably the most popular of the three films , because Julia Robert's " Vivian Ward " humanizes the corporate raider " Edward Lewis " ( Richard Gere ) and thus they manage to save each other . Economic realities remain in PRETTY WOMEN . Vivian , and her pal Kit De Luca ( Laura San Giacomo ) are hookers . They both are smarter than most but they are at the mercy of mean streets , mean Johns , and possibly mean pimps . Ironically they both work in Hollywood , only blocks away from the super rich . One night Vivian is picked up by a man in a fancy sports car . It is Edward , who is planning a hostile take-over of a ship building empire owned by James Morse ( Ralph Bellamy ) , with the assistance of his long-time legal aide Philip Stuckey ( Jason Alexander ) . Edward has just left one of Stuckey's parties ( Stuckey tries to be as ingratiating to the aloof Edward as he can - and mistakenly thinks he has succeeded in being so ) . Needing real release , Edward takes Vivian to his hotel suite . What begins as a paid trick ends differently . FVivian is able to lighten Edward's spirits slowly so that he enjoys her for her company as well as the sex . Then the corporate raid gets so complex that Edward has to take an entire week to conclude it . Edward offers Vivian a chance to make a small fortune if she will stay with him for the week . After some bargaining ( which she is good at ) she agrees . She learns that having money does not mean being acceptable . She is asked to get some fancy dinner clothing for a meeting with Morse and his grandson David ( Alex Hyde-White ) . She tries to get the clothing at a snobbish store on Rodeo Drive , and is humiliated by the hostile staff . Subsequently she also has a brief problem with the manager of the hotel Barney Thompson ( Hector Elizondo ) , but it clears up when members of the staff vouch for her being with Edward . Subsequently Barney turns out to be sympathetic to Vivian's needs for assistance for getting a decent dress and for learning proper eating etiquette . When Edward learns about the nastiness of the staff at the snobbish store he assists Vivian in getting more fancy clothing , and Vivian has a choice moment of revenge on the snobs . Edward is soon planning how to force Morse to the wall , but Stuckey is curious about a type of distance in this business deal that is developing between Edward and the project , and ( worse to Stuckey ) between Edward and him . Edward is soon spending increasing times away to be with Vivian . While much of their time is between the sheets , they also are enjoying each other's company and she is teaching him to ease up and release his human side . He explains to her that his business habits were based on a hatred of his father , a man who deserted his mother and Edward for another woman . After Edward's mother died , Edward went to work to make himself into the corporate raider he became , and his first great victory was the destruction of his father's company . He has been repeating this success ever since - but ( despite one small victory due to therapy ) he is not a happy person . Vivian explains that she grew up in an unhappy poor family , and she left to try to improve herself , but she never graduated high school ( despite being quite sharp ) . She also has always dreamed of one day finding a man who could rescue her - her image of him based on how her mother would lock her in a closet as punishment and her knight / prince would come to release her . The fairy tale element in the film frequently hides the Freudian image of both leads - neither having had happy childhoods . We never learn of Vivian's relations with her Dad , but she and her mother were quite at odds . We know that Edward blamed his father for the death ( soon after his father's desertion ) of Edward's mother . Both are strong , capable figures , but both are desperately unhappy ones . As the film heads to it's conclusions ( there are several ) we realize they should be together - neither will ever fully function well without the other ( although they would both survive ) . But they have to overcome their equal repugnance at each other's lifestyle : Vivian has to get Edward away from constantly destroying his father again and again by corporate raiding ( especially after she meets the Morses ) , and Edward keeps wanting to get Vivian off those mean streets - but keeps fumbling trying to overcome his dislike of her being a prostitute . The film succeeds as the two characters break with their pasts . In the end corporate raiding and prostitution are discarded ( not only by the main characters , but Vivian even pushes Kit towards cleaning up her act ) , and the last image of Edward and Vivian holding each other for support on an old building's fire escape . We know they'll make it .
491610	3280905	35446	10.0	Swan Song in Warsaw	In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR , in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini . Despite the new European war , we were yet still at peace with both Axis states . Hollywood , with rare exceptions ( BLOCKADE , CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY , ESCAPE ) had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists . Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd . It had a big box office success , and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at . Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat . Actually other voices were beginning to stir in Hollywood . One was the great comedy director Ernst Lubitsch , who poked an occasional jab at the Nazis . Lubitsch had to wait until 1941 for a full assault on the Nazis - TO BE OR NOT TO BE , a film that looked at the German invasion of Poland , and it's occupation of Warsaw . It had an interesting cast . The lead went to Carole Lombard , who had many comedy performances under her belt . She played Maria Tura , the leading lady ( and wife ) of " that great actor " ( as he always prefaces his remarks ) Joseph Tura . Joseph is Jack Benny . Of all the leading men in her career , Lombard never played opposite one who was really more of a star in a different medium . Typical co-stars for Lombard were John Barrymore , Fred MacMurray , Cary Grant , Ralph Bellamy , William Powell , Robert Montgomery , Clark Gable , and Fredric March . Here it was Benny , who while he had a string of movie credits was basically a radio comedy star ( and later would be a television star ) . His best films ( GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE , ARTISTS AND MODELS , CHARLIE'S AUNT ) were not record breakers at the box office . In fact , while his performances were good in these , he did not necessarily shine in them ( Laird Cregar , in one simple moment in CHARLIE'S AUNT , got the biggest laugh of the film ) . Nobody realized that his performance as Joseph Tura would be his best one , and that within two years he'd make his final starring fiasco in THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT . Benny and Lombard proved to work well together as the egotistical , but oddly loving couple of theater hams . In fact the actors making up the Tura company are all good , including Lionel Atwill ( who briefly is seen playing Claudius to Benny's Hamlet ) , Felix Bressart as Greenberg ( who dreams of doing the Shylock speech from THE MERCHANT OF VENICE ) , Tom Dugan as Bronski ( who hopes to play Hitler on the stage ) , Charles Halton as Dubosch ( the stage manager , and the head of the Warsaw underground ) , and Maude Eburne as Lombard's cynical maid Anna . The screenplay did give plenty of time showing the difficulties and tensions of a stage company working together , and of handling temperamental stars and their egos . While putting on a play lampooning the Nazis ( whom Benny and the others dislike ) , the government of Poland ( Frank Reicher ) says that due to the growing problems with Germany the play can't be produced . So the troop put on Tura's production of HAMLET . Benny as the Prince of Denmark ( giving the great soliloquy ) goes through the proper steps , although knowing the comedian from Radio one expects him to start it with " WELL ! " . But he finds that a man in uniform ( young Robert Stack ) leaves his seat in the middle of the third aisles just as he begins , " To be or not to be . . . . " He does not know ( until later in the film ) that Stack had arranged to do this to keep a rendezvous with Lombard in her dressing room . Subsequently he treats her to a plane flight ( he is a Polish Air Force pilot ) . When war comes he and his fellows fight , but the survivors make it to England . The grimmest section of the film is the occupation scenes . Like the comedy in THE GREAT DICTATOR , because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal . But in they still get the fears and difficulties of the occupation across . Signs of stores and streets we saw hanging normally earlier are in ruins ( including a delicatessen ) . The theater is boarded up . Had Lubitsch wished to do a tragic film he could easily have done so . But he allows the situation to blossom into a black comedy . Stanley Ridges plays Professor Siletsky , a secret German Agent who has fooled the Allies into going back to Warsaw . He has the names of families of the pilots . Stack is sent back to Warsaw to stop him , and contacts Lombard who helps . Soon the entire theater group gets involved . But will their theatrical egos blow their anti-Nazi plans ? That is the running theme of the concluding portion of the film . Also along for the ride is Sig Ruman as Col . Ehrhardt , the Gestapo Chief who relishes the name " Concentration Camp Ehrhardt " , but who keeps running afoul of Professor Siletsky ( it is the Professor , isn't it ? ) , when he makes seemingly harmless comments about Hitler . His reaction is usually to yell for his adjutant , Schultz ( Henry Victor ) , whose whole purpose is apparently to be there to be yelled at . The film was a great success , but the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash a month after it was shot cast a shadow over it . Yet it was a fitting swan song for that divine comedienne's career .
491765	3280905	40102	10.0	The Start of the Horrible Hubbards	Lillian Hellman , wrote her dramatic masterpiece , THE LITTLE FOXES , in 1940 . It is about Regina Hubbard , her brothers Ben and Oscar , her husband Horace Giddens and daughter Alexandra , and Oscar's wife Birdy and son Leo , and how the entire Hubbard clan ( except for the husband and daughter and Oscar's sad misused wife ) are corrupt . The first play shows how Regina manages to allow her husband to die so that she can end up richer and more powerful ( out of a questionable business deal ) than her two brothers who are her partners in it . On stage it was a great dramatic triumph for Tallulah Bankhead . In 1941 it was an equally affective film directed by William Wyler , and starring Bette Davis , Herbert Marshall , Theresa Wright , Charles Dingle , Carl Benton Reid , Dan Duryea , Richard Carlson , and Patricia Collinge . A few years later , Ms Hellman decided to return to the story of the Hubbards , but this time with a " prequel " : How did this wealthy southern family turn out to be so rotten ? ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST goes back to 1880 ( THE LITTLE FOXES actually is set about 1905 ) . Marcus Hubbard ( Frederic March ) was what used to be called " poor white trash " ( another example of this type is the slave overseer turned carpetbagger Victor Jory in GONE WITH THE WIND ) . He is not a polished Southern Gentleman , but an opportunistic snake who lives and breaths to snatch his fortune in the potentially rich South . But along comes that unpleasantness of 1861 - 1865 , and Marcus does not consider it his war - why should it be , he's been too poor to fight for the right to own slaves ? Instead , he makes a small fortune buying and selling commodities that are in short supply or are considered contraband . In particular salt . Using the money , and the corresponding collapse of various gentleman's estates due to the reverses of the war , Marcus becomes a post-Civil War landowner . All of this has made him also the most hated man in the state . His oldest son Ben ( Dingle in the other movie - here Edmond O'Brien ) is his clerk ( not chief clerk , but clerk ) in his store in town . Ben is treated as a clerk ( and a poorly paid one at that ) . Ben is close to his mother Lavinia ( Florence Eldridge ) , who was married to Marcus for financial reasons by her father , and whom Marcus considers ( with some reason ) simple minded ( actually she is the most honest member of the bunch ) . Marcus ' second son Oscar ( Reid in the other movie - here Dan Duryea ) is a sullen sort , except he has joined the K . K . K . ( but is dumb enough to be the only one who's identifiable ) , and he is romancing a local " actress " at the town's dance hall ( Laurette Sincee - played by Donna Drake ) . Marcus favors his daughter , Regina ( Ann Blythe ) , who realizes he likes her and thinks she can manipulate him . To an extent she can - but there is a point he refuses to be manipulated . You see , she wants to marry John Bagtry ( John Dall ) , a member of a former Governor's family who are on hard times . Actually , Marcus would have none of this . Marcus is not adverse to further wealth and acquisition , but as he is now a large property owner ( and the richest man in town ) he's more pretentious . He is self taught , and he prides himself on teaching himself how to read Greek and Latin ( which does not impress Ben , Oscar , or Regina ) . He also tries to compose for the cello , and once every couple of months has two musicians ( Don Beddoes and Whit Bissell ) come down to play his latest compositions . The issues of the drama are 1 ) Ben seeking to find a way to break out of his unendurable bondage as his father's cheap clerk ; 2 ) Oscar's hope to run off with the attractive but socially disgraceful Laurette ; and 3 ) Regina trying to convince Marcus to give her his okay to marry the socially proper but dirt poor Bagtry . The three siblings are constantly sniping at each other , making cooperation impossible ( particularly Regina and Oscar with their separate prospective mates ) . The only thing that might unite them is Daddy's tyrannical approach to handling all three of them , two of whom he holds in total contempt . Lest it seems pure soap opera ( of the " Dallas " or " Falconcrest " variety ) , ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST actually gave Hellman a chance to do some comedy scenes . Marcus has a large dinner party in Act II , and has to suffer the mortification of Oscar's drunken girlfriend , and the chattering of the prospective fianc√© ( John Bagtry's sister Birdie ) that he wants Oscar to marry . He also learns what John Bagtry's big desire is : he is going to enlist in the Brazilian Army because in 1880 only the Empire of Brazil still has slavery ! Marcus comment about that is quite droll . There is also the fiasco of Hubbard's Opus # 2 for strings . In the end we see how Ben finds Marcus's one Achilles heel - an unforgivable act to his fellow townspeople which can cost him his life . And we see how Ben takes his place , for the moment at any events , as head of the Hubbard Family enterprises . ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST is a good film that deserves to be better known . Well played , and carefully laid out ( with Dan Duryea here playing the father of the character he played in THE LITTLE FOXES ) we watch how power rots a family's morality , but does not necessarily weakens it . For the Hubbards remain rich and powerful , and aim to become more so as this story ends . Whatever lost dreams are seen by the audience , the damage is done and the gangrene remains to grow more threatening .
491899	3280905	113862	10.0	A Most Moving Teacher's Film	There are plenty of films about the effect of teacher's over the years on their students . The best known is GOODBYE MR . CHIPS with Robert Donat , but there are others ( GOOD MORNING , MISS DOVE , for example ) . The tragic personal life of the teacher as opposed to his or her dedication to the students is the subject of the drama . Yet the formula works when does well , and MR . HOLLAND'S OPUS was an example of such a successful version . Richard Dreyfus is Glenn Holland , who has been hired in 1965 to teach music appreciation at JOHN F . KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL ( the principal is Olympia Dukakis , and the vice principal is William H . Macy ) . Holland's wife ( Iris - Glenne Headley ) and there child Cole are in a house in the town , and we watch his domestic tragedy - not so much with his wife , but that their son is deaf . Holland concentrates over time on his students , and his constant warfare with the vice principal on matters like rock and roll or the values of music appreciation in learning . Among the students he helps are young athletes trying to accomplish academic achievement , young women trying to break into the field of entertainment or trying to bolster their self-confidence . But he is constantly brought up short by the problems of his relations with his family - especially as his son Cole grows up ( Joseph Anderson - age 15 Cole here ) . Cole is deaf but he is intelligent , and he blows up when Glenn fails to realize that Cole is intelligent about music - a subject he thinks Cole can never share with him . The running thread through all this is that Glenn began the teaching gig as a money maker while he creates his musical masterpiece - a symphony . But both the home life and the school work take up all his time . Yet , as the film ends he realizes that he did leave an imprint on his students , and he did prove a warm and loving husband and father despite real strains due to Cole's condition . The film ends with a proper validation of his full success . Dreyfus was wonderful as Glenn ( ably supported by Headley , Macy , Dukakis , and Jay Thomas as his friend the sports coach ) , and got nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar . While he did not win , his career rejuvenated . And he would eventually try ( with Thomas ) to do a television show in the next decade that dealt with the problems of a teacher in a high school .
492881	3280905	29604	10.0	Before The Women There was Stagedoor	I have always found this wonderful film neglected and I can't understand why . It's director , Gregory La Cava , was highly respected for movies like RUGGLES OF RED GAP and STAGE DOOR in the 1930s , but never got the sort of notice he deserved . Students of film talk of the De Milles and the Wilders and the Lubitschs and the Fords . They may take serious note of Michael Curtiz or Leo McCarey . But La Cava is sort of relegated with Henry Hathaway or George Marshall as well crafting with his material , but nothing outstanding as a type of symbol of their singularity or originality . In fact , many people probably think of La Cava more as one of the intimate friends of W . C . Fields ( like Eddie Sutherland , another director ) than for his films . But in 1937 , two years before George Cukor did an all female cast movie THE WOMEN , La Cava did this film version of the George F . Kaufman and Edna Ferber drama STAGE DOOR . This film does have men in the cast : Samuel Hinds as the wealthy father of Hepburn ; Adolphe Menjou as the stage producer with the moral code of an opportunist ; Jack Carson as a suitor for Lucille Ball and Grady Sutton as a suitor for the servant in the boardinghouse ; Franklin Pangborne as Menjou's too perfect butler , Frank Reicher as the stage director - who finally sees his troublesome star perform the role properly in her own way . But most of the really meaty parts go ( as they should ) to the women in this cast . The women are all the inhabitants of a boardinghouse in Manhattan for aspiring actresses . As the film progresses we concentrate on Ginger Rogers , Katherine Hepburn , Andrea Leeds , Gail Patrick , and Constance Collier . Three others in the supporting cast are notable ( as their subsequent careers showed ) : Lucille Ball , Eve Arden , and Ann Miller . Rogers is interested in advancing her career ( as is Patrick , as is Leeds , and - as we learn - is Hepburn ) . But Rogers is street smart , and initially she sees that her chief rival is her roommate Patrick , who has been romancing Menjou . When Rogers manages to replace Patrick ( momentarily ) she does nicely materially ( as Patrick did ) , but she does not see her career notably advance . She ends the relationship with Menjou by suggesting marriage . Hepburn is determined to show what she can do as an actress ( she's been to college ) . All she succeeds is to get a lead role ( through nothing that she has done - but through outside influences she knows nothing about ) , and her gain is at the expense of the delicate , talented , and ill Leeds . Hepburn does pick up various pointers about acting from coach and supporting actress Constance Collier , but most of the women in the boarding house think the pair of them are snooty phonies . Eventually Hepburn does give the performance of her life - but it takes a tragedy to get her to do it . Up to then her lack of training keeps preventing her from reciting the lines correctly ( to the dismay of the dramatist as well as Frank Reicher the director ) . When she is aware of the tragedy ( an unforgettable moment in the film when it occurs ) , she is transformed into a figure capable of delivering the performance correctly . Hepburn used dialog from a failed Broadway play she did called THE LAKE , and the opening scene is shown in the film . It sounds pretentious , but her " The callalillies are in bloom again . . . . " became part of her legend ( whenever attempts were made to imitate her in cartoons for example ) . All the characters and actresses show their strength in the conclusion , with Collier demonstrating a surprising strength of character to steel up Hepburn's weakened backbone . Rogers vents her spleen to Hepburn , doubly hurtful because she and Hepburn had slowly been working out the problems between them . And so it goes with the rest of the cast . I don't know of too many other ensembles films where everyone had a moment to shine as here ( THE OX-BOW INCIDENT comes close ) . It was a first rate film , and deserves more attention than it has been given over the years by the critics and public .
492683	3280905	90274	10.0	" Ask What You Can Do For Your Country ! "	VOLUNTEERS was the second and last time Tom Hanks was teamed with one of the few television based comedians who could match him as a film actor : John Candy . They had been brothers in SPLASH , and VOLUNTEERS makes them fellow members of the Peace Corps . They proved to have good chemistry again here - but no follow-up film showed up for them after this . Pity , but maybe just as well as they each would make their own line of comic masterpieces . VOLUNTEERS is also one of the first times that Hanks plays a somewhat unlikeable ( if charming ) type . Lawrence Osborne IV is a patrician who has just gone through four years at Yale University . We never know what his major was , but he certainly has enjoyed extra-curriculum activities ( such as dating the valedictorian of Smith College ) , and winning multi-thousand dollar poker matches with vicious opponents . But Lawrence owes a gambling hall owner ( Alan Arbus ) $14 , 000 . 00 , and decides to bet it all double or nothing on the outcome of a basketball championship the next day ( his graduation date from Yale ) . He is listening to the game on a radio ( while missing the speech by guest speaker President John F . Kennedy ) at the ceremony - and hears his bet going down the tubes . That night he asks his father ( George Plimpton ) for the $28 , 000 . But the senior Osborne actually is very realistic - he feels that being beaten and injured for such a stupid bet is just what Lawrence needs , and he refuses to pay the bet . Chased by Arbus's bouncer / collector ( Ji-Tu Cumbuku , as a no-nonsense collector who will go as far as possible to get Lawrence , whom he hates ) , Lawrence hies to New York's Idlewild Airport , and manages to get onto a plane as a member of the Peace Corps group going to Thailand . Lawrence meets Beth Wexler ( Rita Wilson - now Mrs . Hanks in real life ) , a New York medical student , and Tom Tuttle from Tacoma , Washington ( Candy ) who is an intensive student of management psychiatry . Candy is also an engineer . When they are taken to a village for their service by helicopter operator John Reynolds ( Tim Thompson ) they find they are assigned to build a bridge connecting this village with the other shore . Soon it turns out that others are interested in that bridge : the local war lord and opium dealer ( Chumg Mee - Ernest Harada ) and the local Communists insurgents . While Lawrence tries to get back home ( and finds his wise father has made it impossible for him to do so ) , he finds that he has annoyed Beth ( who is more impressed by Reynolds ) , and he is dealing with the over-active and inept Tuttle . But soon Tuttle vanishes into the jungle ( and into the hands of the Communists ) while Lawrence finds he needs to rely on a smart local villager ( Gedde Wantanabe ) which is good because both men are threatened by the war lord to get that bridge built or else . What follows is a delight , as Lawrence does build the bridge , and then realizes ( much as Col . Nicholson does at the end of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI ) that it was a dreadful mistake , and the poor villagers are in danger from two evil groups as a result . Hanks never loses his charm and insouciance , even as he grows into a responsible local leader . Candy is a wonder as an would-be world saver , an over-achiever who insults people as he tries to show he has a heart . Wilson is good explaining how she wants to help the villagers , speaking in Thai - but telling how she wants to kill them ! Wantanabe is constantly finding his warnings and realistic view of the situation is ignored and he gets injured as a result ( or even sexually threatened by a trio of sumo-wrestler guards of the War Lord ) . And Thompson has only one really close friend - his knife . He makes George Macready's relationship with his sword stick in GILDA look matter-of-fact in comparison . Finally there is a definite love affair with David Lean in this film . Besides the similarities with THE RIVER KWAI ( including Candy whistling " Col . Bogie's March " and saying , " What have I done ! " ) there is the concluding shot of Hanks ( having brought prosperity to the village ) being cheered by the people with cries of " Lawrence , Lawrence ! " . Wonderful comedy here .
492999	3280905	51658	10.0	Gaston's search for domestic contentment	Although several of Vincent Minelli's films can be given consideration for being his best , particularly " An American In Paris " , " Meet Me In St . Louis " , " Some Came Running " , and " The Bandwagon " , a solid case can be made that " Gigi " is the best one . Based ( or developed ) from a novella by Colette , " Gigi " boasted a score by Learner and Loewe that sparkled with hits like " The Night They Invented Champaign " , " Say A Prayer For Me Tonight " , " I Remember It Well " , and " I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore . " The cast was impeccable , with Leslie Caron as the gamin girl who " blossomed like a flower " , Hermoine Gingold as her sensible ( but practical grandmother ) , Isobel Jean as her too practical aunt , Eva Gabor as the mistress / lover whose " little heart " was " crooked to the core " , the great Maurice Chevallier ( in what is his signature role ) as the lovable aging rou√© Honore , and Louis Jourdan as the bored Gaston Lachaille . All the elements , including an impeccable sense for the time , decor , and color of 1900 Paris , came together under Minelli's direction , so that the film nearly half-a-century later remains excellent . I imagine that everything about this film has been mentioned in these reviews , so I will just comment on one odd point . Gaston , the son of a very rich sugar refiner millionaire , is a public figure of great importance in the 1900 Paris social scene . He is acute in terms of business ( witness how he buys a French railway at one point , correctly guessing it's stock would go up a certain level of points ) , yet he is unable to win a simple card game . He has entry to every posh event in that poshest and showiest of world capitals , but he is bored by it all . He has apparently had it ladled down his throat so much it does not excite him anymore . All this sets up the ironic twist of the story : this man who is a known regular at Maxim's , who can rent the Eiffel Tower for a special party at any time , finds his best contentment with the simple apartment of Madame Alverez and her granddaughter Gigi . Instead of guzzling sparkling wines and vintages of Ch√¢teau Rothschild , he likes Madame Alverez's chamomile tea . He finds joy in domesticity , and one senses that ( at the end ) he finds a perfect mate in this in Gigi ( except for their occasional visits to the casinos at Deauville , as Gigi likes gambling ) . On the other hand , his uncle Honore ( a character who was only mentioned in passing in the original novella ) is totally different . Honore tells Madame Alverez that he actually was so seriously in love with her when they lived together years earlier that he considered marriage , but panicked and decided to have a fling with an opera singer . While this story does not placate Madame Alverez ( who feels it is one of the oddest reasons ever given for infidelity ) , it suggests that domesticity did attract the Lachaille family members ( we are informed by Honore that Gaston's father and mother are boring ) , but that Honore rejected it out of fear - probably for his freedom . Honore's song , " I'm glad I'm not young anymore " shows that he is not in need of constant companionship , and looks forward to a lack of responsibility towards the opposite sex as he gets older . It's the total reverse of Gaston's rushing for it . It does suggest that it takes all types to make up society .
492775	3280905	46816	10.0	Ironically , our Navy's best remembered " mutiny "	Historically there were two great United States Naval mutinies . In 1842 a naval sloop , the U . S . S . Somers , had a court martial for three crew members ( one , Midshipman Philip Spencer , was the son of Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer ) , which ended with their being found guilty and hanged . To this day there is debate if Spencer ( a troubled youth ) was even serious about seizing the " Somers " . The other occurred in 1944 at Port Chicago , California , when , a few weeks after a terrible accident that killed many men loading ammunition on a boat , their replacements refused to work under existing unsafe conditions . This led to a U . S . Supreme Court decision - against the workers , who claimed they were not under military law . But the best known mutiny in the American navy is that on the U . S . S . Caine , during the hurricane that preceded the battle of Okinawa . That this is a fictional mutiny does not seem to attract any attention . THE CAINE MUTINY was a successful novel , Broadway play ( " THE CAINE MUTINY COURT MARTIAL " ) and a great movie . It remains the American equivalent of the mutiny on the H . M . S . Bounty . The performances of the leads , Bogart , Johnson , MacMurray ( his second of three great heels ) , Ferrer , Tully , and E . G . Marshall are all first rate , as are the supporting cast ( which includes Lee Marvin , Claude Atkins , and Jerry Paris - all of whom had quite substantial careers after this film ) . Only Robert Francis did not have a substantial career after his fine Ensign Keith - he died in a plane crash in 1955 . There are mental images from the film ( mostly connected to Bogart's Queeg ) that people remember - even spoof . Every time you see some character showing nervous ticks , if he or she pulls out a pair of small metal balls and roll them in their hand , it is a salute to Bogie's originally doing it in THE CAINE MUTINY . And his magnificent moment of success : " the strawberries " , and how he proved the theft with geometric precision , remains a signal that the person speaking has too many fixations . Interestingly , the film makes Queeg better ( if still sick ) than the play does . When cross examined by Greenwald at the court martial of Maryk and Keith , Queeg is asked about whether or not he overused his right to free transport of liquor and other items from Hawaii to the mainland from the navy . Queeg at first denies it , but when Greenwald says he can bring in ( as witnesses ) people connected with the sale of the items and the transport of them , Queeg suddenly remembers that he might have . This is not in the film , but it shows that Queeg was not all that clean an officer . That aside , the impact of the film is still terrific half a century after it was shot . It illustrates that personality flaws frequently causes the problems that affect all of us , and that we need more understanding of each other's problems to avoid the bigger ones . From a case of over-extended battle fatigue , the crew of a warship are driven to accept an act of mutiny against it's captain in an emergency situation . And it almost gets two officers disgraced or hanged .
493240	3280905	44876	10.0	The Threat of Sidney Stratton ?	THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT , like I'M ALL RIGHT JACK , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an . . . err . . . accident in a college laboratory ) . He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . When the film begins he is in Michael Gough's company , and Gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law ( Cecil Parker ) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs . While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter ( Joan Greenwood ) , Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems . He reads the huge expenditures ( due to Guinness's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee . Guinness goes on to work at Parker's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too . Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on , and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . The result : Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . Any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever . Guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich . But when he explains to them what he's done , they turn against him . If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! Soon Parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by Gough , Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and Howard Marion-Crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . They seek to suppress the invention . With only Greenwood in his corner ( although Parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public . In the end , Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all . It's a brilliant comedy . But is the argument for suppression valid ? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? What happened to fashion changes and new styles ? And the cloth is only made in the color white ( making Guinness look like a white knight ) . We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . Wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? Alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . As such it is brilliant . But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness ' invention
