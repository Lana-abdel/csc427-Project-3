493207	3280905	46248	1.0	When the Medveds Are Right . . . .	I hesitate to give this a " 1 " for awful , but it is - by all memories of all the bad films I ever saw - the worst I ever saw . The Medved Brothers , back in the 1980s , listed " Robot Monster " among the 50 worst films of all time . It deserves that accolade . With dialog ( serious dialog ) like " I am not a human . . . I am a Ro - Man . " said by an actor in a gorilla suit ( George Barrows , the actor in the gorilla suit , actually played a gorilla in another film in a few years - it must have been one of his so-called talents ) , this is the nadir ( I almost said Nader , for the star of the film ) of bad movie making . It is poverty-row movie making . I notice the name of Ed Wood mentioned in some of the reviews here . Wood never did a good film , but there was ( I believe ) a man in Wood who really felt he had some type of cinematic vision . It was not a trained one - it was quite inept . But if you look at what Wood is attempting to do in some of his films in the 1950s ( tackle cross-dressing in " Glen Or Glenda " , for example ) one can vaguely sympathize with his having some concepts but no talent to really put them across . I think that is why Wood has somehow become a negative Hollywood legend . That can't be said for Phil Tucker . He never seems to have gotten the bug of making just monster movies . When Wood planned " Plan Nine From Outer Space " , he did intend to comment about the danger of our arms race ( it comes out ludicrously in the film , but it is there ) . Tucker could not do that . He just could push together the typical hack like conventions to muddle through . So he has the heroine " vamp " the " Robot Monster " no matter how idiotic it looks . I have never seen Tucker's " Cape Canaveral Monster " , which was his last film , but I suspect it is just a slightly smoother version of the bilge he put together here . I do have one suspicion that makes me think this film was just a poverty row quickie without rhyme or reason ( not like Wood's type of schlock which he actually agonized over at home and when filming ) . I noticed while looking through the credits the backgrounds and fates of the different players . The only one who went anywhere in the 1950s was George Nader , who actually may have done a good performance in one film ( " Away All Boats " ) , but whose career petered out due to his getting involved in a homosexual scandal . He ended doing television in Germany . This film actually was his first real " lead " role . Barrows never had as " important " a role in a film as " Robot Monster " . Selena Royle had done some important films in the 1940s but she was blacklisted ( possibly unfairly ) . She did make a successful second career in Mexico ( which I am glad about ) . John Brown was also a victim of the blacklist . Few know of it today ( despite the decades of reruns of the old Burns and Allen television show ) but he was on the show for a few months in 1950 , replacing Hal March as the neighbor Harry Morgan . Brown , who had a distinguished career in radio comedy shows like " The Life Of Riley " , was replaced by producer George Burns when his sponsor pointed out that Brown was suspected of communist sympathies . He would be replaced by Fred Clark . It is the shows with Clark and later Larry Keating that we have seen to this day . Brown kept working when he could . He died in 1957 . Claudia Barrett's career died out in the 1960s . As for the two child performers , Gregory Moffett acted until about 1956 , and Pamela Paulson never made another film in her life . John Mylong usually played bit-parts in films , frequently ( during World War II ) as Nazis ( he's in " The Hitler Gang " ) . He does play Eddie Duchin's ( Tyrone Power's ) father in " The Eddie Duchin Story " . In short this cast is strictly from hunger in terms of name recognition . All , that is , except the future acting " success " Nader , and the past success Royle , and this is a rung up for the former and a last chance for the latter . When Tucker cast this picture he grabbed people who were desperate to be in anything that offered them a chance to have a speaking part of any type , no matter how silly . Now compare this with Woods - he uses Bela Lugosi again and again , because he recognizes that Lugosi has name recognition with the public , and some degree of talent left as well ( though drug addiction made the latter even weaker than it was ) . He also uses some character actors like Lyle Talbot who have been around for awhile ( the Medveds don't think highly of Talbot , as he seems somewhat humorless - actually at about the same time he worked for Wood , Talbot appeared as himself in a comic series of rivalry confrontations with Bob Cummings on the latter's successful television series " Love That Bob ! " ) . Wood also used local television stars like Vampira and Cresswell the mentalist , and Tor Johnson the Swedish wrestler in his films . In short Wood looks like he made an effort to choose his cast with something approaching thought ( for effect , for what he thought was talent ) . The results might have been laughable , but it showed a type of care . Tucker didn't show that . So for all the cheesiness of Wood's works , we can admire the attempt . We can't with Tucker . The most memorable moment of this movie ? The booming voice deciding to unleash prehistoric monsters on the planet ( we see some kind of lizard roaming a small set - it's supposed to be a tyrannosaur ? ) . I think it was memorable because it came about two minutes before the film ended . It still came two minutes too late .
492726	3280905	48413	3.0	A Ridiculous View of a Historical Titan	Except that this film is short , I was tempted to call it " NAPOLEON BLOWN-APART " , but that suggests the film is actually long and has some degree of detail . THis monstrosity is under ninety minutes . There are short films about Napoleon , but they concentrate on one aspect of the man . CONQUEST deals with Napoleon and his Polish mistress . DESIREE with his relationship with Desiree Clary Bernadotte , the future Queen of Sweden . This was Sacha Guitry's attempt to do a complete account of Napoleon's thirty year career as a world figure , in a totally inadequate amount of time . The French version of the film actually has some continuity lacking in the English version . But most people in the U . S . have seen ( if they have seen it at all ) the English version . It is best known because of the cameo appearances , in particular of Orson Welles as General Hudson Lowe ( who ? - he's the British official who was appointed to be the jailer of Napoleon on St . Helena , but who managed to botch his assignment ) and Eric Von Stroheim ( very briefly ) as Beethoven . Guitry , a talented boulevardier type , essayed the role of Talleyrand . None are shown to great advantage . It is set ( apparently ) in 1821 , with Guitry in his Paris salon , talking to his intellectual friends , upon hearing the death of his former master . To be truthful , knowing Talleyrand , he would have said a word or two about Napoleon but then turned to more interesting current matters . The film does not go into the collapse of the relationship between the great Emperor and his gifted Foreign Secretary . Talleyrand was noted for his selfish ability to destroy a government that was no longer benefiting him , and then reappear in a more powerful position in the next regime . He helped destroy about seven of them , including Napoleon's . Historians have despised his selfishness , but they have usually praised him for knowing when to ditch the Emperor ( Talleyrand was wary of the constant warfare , which the Emperor did not seem to know when to stop - he seemed to be using war to cover previous failures of policy , and to build up his remarkable reputation ) . The final blow was when Napoleon discovered that Talleyrand had been contacting Metternich and other foreign adversaries about undercutting Napoleon's diplomatic forays . In front of the whole court Napoleon cursed out Talleyrand , calling him a silk stocking full of " merde " . He then left the court with his chief courtiers . Talleyrand watched thoughtfully , and said , " How sad that such a great man is so vulgar ! " He redoubled his activities , assisted by his rival and foe ( usually , but not here ) Joseph Fouche , the head of the secret police . In 1814-15 they beat Napoleon at last . None of this is in the movie ( at least the English version ) that we see . Talleyrand is very philosophical , telling the story of the rise , fall , and rise of Napoleon and his legend . But in cramming the events from 1785 to 1821 we get a too rapid outline . The film though does even more than this . Talleyrand tells of how Napoleon's remains are returned to France for burial in Les Invalides ( his magnificent tomb in Paris ) . But this happened in 1840 , ordered by King Louis Philippe for popularity reasons . Only problem is that Talleyrand was dead by 1838 . Since Welles is in the film for about two minutes , I might as well discuss this . In 1955 he was filming CONFIDENTAL REPORT ( a . k . a . MR . ARKADIN ) , and ( like OTHELLO ) he was partly paying for it himself . So Welles was willing to appear in many films ( especially in France ) in bit cameo roles . His part is that of Lowe , who was a mediocre military figure who got the job as a last choice ( the first choice , the Duke of Wellington , felt he and Bonaparte could never share an island together ) . Lowe was introduced to Bonaparte in the latter's residence of Longwood , and Bonaparte was polite like a host . But Lowe just glowered at him ( as Welles does here ) . Bonaparte , quickly judging the idiot that he was stuck with , put his own hat on to show his contempt . It never improved , but we only see this scene . After Bonaparte died , his aides wanted a suitable tomb for him , but every time they presented a statement for the tombstone ( General of the Armies , Emperor of France ) , Lowe turned down the recommendation . In disgust , they suggested a blank tombstone . Stupidly , Lowe agreed ( as a surprised Welles does ) . Lowe never realized how truly eloquent the empty tombstone was - loyal Bonapartists from around the globe would know at that tombstone that no words could describe the giant who was under it adequately . Napoleon really did not need Les Invalides , but the French wanted to do it properly . The film is a total waste as a decent historical chronicle . Catch the 1927 Abel Gance classic , or CONQUEST or even DESIREE ( even though it is a wretched film in it's own right - at least it gives the viewer some idea of how Sweden's modern royal family came into power ) . Catch the Armand Assante two part television movie about Napoleon and Josephine . But , unless you want to see all of Orson Welles or Eric Von Stroheim's performances , ignore this one . For Orson and Eric I give this a three .
491643	3280905	149793	4.0	What an annoying , but sweet ( ? ) little girl	The use of " You Tube " is quite curious because of the memories it reawakens . One such is the long forgotten ( possibly justifiably so ) cartoons about the comic strip child " Little Lulu " . Lulu and her pals like Tubby and Wellington Van Snob were all quite popular in the period from 1935 to 1965 or so . As a kid I recall reading comic books concerning Lulu's antics . She was a determined little girl , and frequently found herself involved in some mischief that she had not quite planned because she wanted to do something ( frequently her plans were countered by the rival plans of her friend and nemesis Tubby ) . Tastes in comics change , particularly kids comics . If we remember fondly the " Krazy Kat " or " Peanuts " or even " Toonerville Trolly " it was something special about those that rings a bell . Lulu was a bit better than " Nancy " with her friend / boy-friend Sluggo . The similarities between the two comics ( both had grown-ups : Lulu had her Dad and Mom , and Nancy her aunt Fritzy ) were too similar to be ignored . Similarly there was Little Audrey as well - more in a later review . I remember now seeing this and other Little Lulu cartoons as a kid - but they rarely pop up these days on television . The reason is not due to the chance of racist material ( although the cartoons were lily white ) but due to them not being very amusing and their heroine not being really appealing . The comic strip was okay ( the comic artists involved had some time to think about the story line - the cartoon looks like an afterthought . It is surprising , because it is part of the Paramount cartoon group that created Betty Boop and Popeye , but by 1946 the Fleischers were no longer in control of their products . If you think of the second period Popeye cartoons , they too are not as ' flavorful " as the ones from the 1930s . They may have better ( or simpler ) line drawing , but they lack the snap of the gags of the earlier ones ( i . e . : Bluto changing a sign on a road from " Detour " to " Route " D " " ) . In the comic Lulu has real spirit - she confronts Tubby if he is trying to prevent her plans , and she fights back with all her might . Here , at least in this cartoon , she is at best a sweet little girl that is trying to exchange a doll for another toy . But she has has no sense that she is not to treat the department store as a private playground while hunting for a replacement item . She gradually drives the floor walker ( initially quite friendly ) progressively insane . Now , I suppose the sight gags of this cartoon ( the floorwalker trying to interest Lulu in a baby carriage with baby bib and rattle , crying when the rattle breaks , and crying inside the carriage is an example ) seemed amusing enough , but the fact is this cartoon is very annoying . Lulu is supposed to be about eleven or twelve years old . Yet she cares nothing for any adult , or anyone else in the department store or even in the streets ( her scooter has a police siren on it to clear a path for her in the traffic ) . She converts part of the floor of the store into an ice rink to supposedly test a pair of skates . She skis down a staircase and soars over several beds . She tests a vacuum cleaner to see if it can empty a fish tank that looks like a water fall ( why is she interested in doing that - did she want to acquire the vacuum cleaner ? Why , she's only twelve ? ! ) . One gets the impression she is a thoroughly selfish kid who deserves to be spanked or punished in some way . Instead , after wrecking the department store , she reclaims the original doll she was returning . As I said , in 1946 it may have been amusing to people . I find that if she had broken her leg skiing or skating as she did , it would have been more emotionally satisfying to a modern audience , horrific as that may sound . But is it any more horrific as turning a department store into a wreck ?
492076	3280905	53214	4.0	Seen once , and memorable for one scene only	Clifton Webb was always a difficult person to cast - in the 1940s and 1950s they just did not make movies where he would have fit perfectly : films where his character was openly gay . There are elements in his films ( especially in LAURA and THE DARK CORNER and THE RAZOR'S EDGE ) that suggest a high strung , waspy , near - homosexual type . So does his Mr . Belvedere . But throughout the 1950s his films concentrated on him as a father ( frequently with large families ) and a husband - even ( in DREAMBOAT ) a sexy movie idol of the silent period ! This film is of those " family oriented " comedies that Webb made in the 1950s . As pointed out , it was based on a Broadway comedy , and it probably was purchased with Webb in mind . With his ability to personify intellectual types , he fits the free-thinking Horace Pennypacker . The Pennypacker family was actually quite distinguished in 19th Century Pennsylvania . One of them , General Galusha Pennypacker was a American Civil War hero , and Samuel Pennypacker was Governor of Pennsylvania from 1903 to 1907 . As to an actual historical figure named Horace Pennypacker I cannot say ( although one of the reviews on this thread suggest there may have been some reality about the situation regarding the bigamy . However , the play turned film was dull . Webb tried to be funny ( even skating at one point ) , but the dialog really was not very good . The best moment in the film is between Richard Deacon ( a member of an organization like The Society to Suppress Vice or something like that ) and Charles Coburn . Deacon has found that Pennypacker has been passing around ( presumably freely ) a booklet of a mildly risqué nature concerning biology . It has flip pictures ( you flip the pictures and they look like they move ) . Unfortunately Deacon has never had Horace Pennypacker pointed out to him . So when he sees Charles Coburn leaving his grandson's ( Webb's ) home , he concludes that Coburn is Horace Pennypacker . He confronts Coburn , and asks , " Are you Mr . Pennypacker ? " " Yes " , says the mildly annoyed Coburn . " Of Pennypacker & Co . ? " , asks Deacon . " Yes , yes . . . what do you want with me ? ! " , shouts Coburn . " THIS ! " , says a triumphant Deacon - he flips the pages of the book in front of Coburn's face . " BaH ! ! " , shouts Coburn , who knocks the book out of Deacon's hands . " You assaulted me . . . yes you did ! ! " , says Deacon and he signals a waiting policeman who drags a protesting Coburn away ( he later apparently straightens out the mistake , for he shows up to confront Webb before the end of the film ) . It was a mildly amusing moment in the film - and the best one , unfortunately . One has to admit that THE REMARKABLE MR . PENNYPACKER was one of the weaker features that Clifton Webb made in Hollywood .
493443	3280905	660820	5.0	Twentieth Century Disasters meet a " Flying Dutchman "	A bit of background is needed here . In the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic , some of those who were in the water , but were pulled up into the lifeboats , still died as a result of exposure . The most notable victim among these was John Philips , one of the two brave wireless men - the other was Harold Bride - who kept sending distress messages for the two and a half hours the Titanic was sinking : Philips died just before the Carpathia arrived . The Carpathia and other rescue ships had to spend some time picking up hundreds of corpses . Not all of the 1500 odd victims were found - many floated away hundreds of miles until their bodies sank . But a little over two hundred were actually retrieved and buried on land ( mostly in Halifax , Canada ) . In the shifting of the bodies from the actually living survivors , four dead bodies were left in a rubber collapsible boat . A few weeks after they were left , the boat was found again by one of the other " rescue vessels " , and rather than return these decaying corpses , they were wrapped up and tied to the collapsible , and the collapsible allowed to be deflated and sunk into the Atlantic . It is believed that this particular story is the basis for the " NIGHT GALLERY " episode known as LONE SURVIVOR , although an older sea legend is connected , as well as the tale of the man who fled the Titanic and was supposedly wearing a dress or a woman's shawl ( most likely candidate for that was a steerage passenger named Patrick Buckley , who was wearing a shawl ) . The episode on " NIGHT GALLERY " dealt with a lifeboat of the Titanic found floating in the North Atlantic ( more precisely , floating off the coast of southern Ireland near the Old Head of Kinsale ) on May 7 , 1915 . There is a dazed man in it , and he is alive . How has he been able to survive for three years ? The episode was not the best written - except for occasional segments of the new series , Sterling's crisp writing from THE TWILIGHT ZONE was not as obvious in his second , lesser series . The Captain of the ship ( Torin Thatcher ) and the ship's doctor ( Hedley Mattingly ) try to deal with this strange survivor ( John Colicos ) only to find that he is as dazed about why he has been at sea for three years as they are . He can recall the night to remember , but he needs awhile to remember the details . Eventually he realizes that he is the Flying Dutchman - he is a specter who is doomed ( as punishment for fleeing the Titanic in the place of a woman ) to be at sea , saved from one doomed ship to go to another doomed ship forever . He tells Mattingly to warn Thatcher that the Lusitania will be torpedoed that day off Ireland . Mattingly does tell a dismissive Thatcher , but then Thatcher notices that Mattingly and the other crew and passengers seemed to have disappeared . A moment later we see the wake of torpedo and hear the explosion . The last moments of the episode ( of course ) shows that some forty one year , in July 1956 , off Nantucket , Massachusetts , a lifeboat from the Lusitania is spotted with one survivor in it - and picked up by the crew of the Andrea Doria . If one figured out the timing of the years between Titanic and the second disaster , it was pretty easy to figure out what unnamed ship picked up the lone survivor in the Titanic lifeboat . Oddly enough they jumped to the next famous luxury liner disaster - they could have chosen ( instead ) to pick , say , the " Vestris " or the " Morro Castle " or the " Dara " from that forty year period . If the acting was sufficiently good to keep one watching , the story was not compelling enough to merit the retelling . One interesting feature regarding one of the performers . Hedley Mattingley was in many television shows , most notably in DAKTARI with Marshall Thompson in the middle 1960s . His appearance here is a decent performance ( complete with beard ) but nothing special there . What is special is a little ironic . If you check his thread on this board , Mattingley was born on May 7 , 1915 ! He came in just as the Lusitania left the scene .
492585	3280905	19702	5.0	" The British Museum Had Lost It's Charm . . . . "	Like so many of his films , because Alfred Hitchcock became such a great director his name became a hallmark for suspense . To attach his name with any project gives that project a " leg up " . This happens with many major directors : Capra , Welles , Huston . . . the list is simply endless . Their fans think they can do no wrong , even if the film isn't that good . BLACKMAIL was Hitchcock's last silent movie , and first sound film . It was also one of the first two sound films in British motion pictures . So it is historically significant - a milestone film everyone is aware of , but one few necessarily watch . He does ( in my view ) one really good sequence in it : the robbery and chase in the British Museum . Fortunately this is in the conclusion of the film , and it does help the movie that it is at the end ( it raises the excitement of what really is a dull movie ) . But that said , the defects of the film's plot , and the transition to sound planning , stand out . Noteworthy too , by the way , is that it is the second most famous titled work that Cyril Richard showed up in that has survived . Here we see the young Cyril as an artist , a lady's man ( which is surprising ) , a would-be rapist , and a corpse to push the plot along . Not quite the same thing as his dashing and vigorous " Captain Hook " in the television version of PETER PAN , but sometimes artists can't pick and choose what they will be memorable for . If you are interested , while looking over his movie / television credits , I noted the next interesting movie he did pop up in was THE WINSLOW BOY ( 1949 ) in an extra role . His best grown-up role on stage , as " Sir Sir " in THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT THE SMELL OF THE CROWD , unfortunately was never filmed or taped ( but there is a record of his and Anthony Newley's singing ) . As is pointed out Donald Calthrop gave the best performance , as the blackmailer , of the three leads . The hero and heroine are somewhat colorless in comparison to Calthrop and Richard . The plot too is somewhat stupid ( as also was pointed out ) because Anya Ondra could have defied the blackmailer by showing she was attacked and defended herself ( as again was pointed out ) . The behavior of her boyfriend ( John Longden ) , however , is less defensible . Policeman are not supposed to tamper with evidence . However , her relationship with Longden points the way to Sylvia Sidney's with John Loder in SABOTAGE , and Theresa Wright's with MacDonald Carey's in SHADOW OF A DOUBT , and Cary Grant's with Eva Marie Saint's in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ( among other Hitchcock films - and better ones ) . Hitchcock apparently re-shot the whole film with sound ( and secretly ) because of an order from the studio to only do the last reel in sound . He felt it was silly and so secretly re-shot it all in sound . BAD IDEA ALF . The problem with a last minute change like that ( as Hitchcock would have soon realized , but never admitted ) is that you need a full script with complete dialog to carry off something like a total film in sound . If one watches BLACKMAIL , for two thirds of it the " sound " is quite limited to very occasional talking . There are huge periods when people aimlessly move about without saying anything . It's very annoying after awhile : Are we to see this as a silent movie ( where this would work ) ? Well , turn off the sound ! But what are they saying ? Well then , put on the sound but give them something worthwhile to hear and without long , pointless gaps ! Hitch tried to bridge the two , and flopped . His fans admire his being the first , and this being his first " talkie " . Well and good , but it does not begin to compare with the films he began to make from 1934 - 1939 in England , and the films he made in Hollywood .
491712	3280905	32850	5.0	You had trouble , my friends . . . right here in Manitoba .	Cecil B . DeMille's fame as a leading movie director is still secure because of his innovative nature . He certainly developed spectacle movies , and even today he is remembered as the pioneer . But that does not blind us to his flaws . His characters are not three dimensional usually but black or white in personality . His dialog is for the birds . He does fall into stereotypes too often . It is understandable that the Medveds included " Northwest Mounted Police " among the 50 worst movies ever made . Yet one can't easily dismiss it . It was DeMille's first color movie . It was the second of four films with Gary Cooper , one of four made Goddard and one of three made with Robert Preston . Preston made good action films in this period but was always in support . In the early 1950s he returned to the stage and the fame that eluded him in Hollywood . Came " The Music Man " , " The Lion In Winter " , and " Mack and Mabel " and the recognition of Preston the adept entertainer . Came the call back to Hollywood for his filmed performances as Harold Hill and Toddy ( in " Victor / Victoria " ) . Preston was that rarity : an actor who proved his star qualities in middle-age . DeMille would never have been his kind of director : he had no light touch for comedy , and he did not do musicals . Still , for some good straight performances as doomed weaklings , Preston did well in this film , " Union Pacific " , and " Reap the Wild Wind " . The film's historic content is interesting . DeMille's earlier historic films ( " Cleopatra " , " Sign of the Cross " , " The Crusades " ) dealt with old world history . But after the last DeMille concentrated on American history with " The Plainsman " , " The Buccaneer " , " Union Pacific " , " Reap The Wild Wind " , and " The Unconquered " . Even the modern " The Story of Dr . Wassell " was based on a true tale connected with the current war in the Pacific . Because of his American History period " Northwest Mounted Police " is an odd film . Cooper's character is the only link in it to American history in the 1880s , as a Texas Ranger after George Bancroft ( Le Corbeau ) for murder . The film is set firmly in Canada which was the scene of two revolts of the Metis people under Louis Riel in 1870 and 1885 . As such this becomes somewhat unique among the historic films of Hollywood . Canada does poorly regarding it's history in Hollywood . This movie actually covers one of the most troubling moments of modern Canadian history : the fate of Louis Riel . We don't know about it down here . Riel was a lawyer and teacher with some mental problems . Riel helped found the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan , thus making him one of Canadian history's founding fathers . But he was also aware that French Canadians and his Metis people got a suspiciously short deal from the British Canadians in Canada . Canada was firmly controlled by the Tory party led by Sir John MacDonald . MacDonald was corrupt but made one of the great comebacks in political history in 1879 . Riel had led a revolt in 1870 which was crushed . He fled to the U . S . , and spent some time in asylums here . He was released , taught school in Montana , and then returned to Canada ( illegally ) in 1884 . He organized a second Metis revolt , which nearly succeeded in winning an independent state . A British army crushed it in 1885 , captured Riel , and he was tried for treason . Lives had been lost , and property destroyed . MacDonald's son had been sent to Manitoba to run the province , and he had been humiliated by the revolt . Riel , however , had some legitimate gripes about the treatment of French Canadians , and the Metis . The treason trial came , and he was found guilty . MacDonald apparently never had a moment's hesitation about what to do . He refused to stop Riel's execution . The Tory Party in Canada has never recovered from this mistake . The backbone of Liberal Party strength ( to the current day ) is French Canadien Quebec - they have never forgiven the Tories for not acting humanely to Louis ( and putting him in a Canadian asylum for life ) . DeMille is not totally anti-Riel . Riel is not unlike the American John Brown ( inthe contemporary film " Santa Fe Trail " ) , who is murderous and possibly insane but fighting for certain principles that actually get the audience's sympathy . In this film , Riel is committed to a Metis revolt and state and he will stop at nothing to prevent it's success . But he also is shown as a kindly man to young children ( he was a school teacher , remember ) . He is trying to save a way of life that a juggernaut threatens . And he is resigned to his fate at the end , realizing that in dying he may still win ( which happened ) . We need a subsidiary villain like Van Heflin in " Sante Fe Trail " who is villainous for money . Here it is Bancroft , a murderer and criminal who is Riel's assistant . His villainy is passed down through his genes to his daughter ( Goddard ) who tempts and betrays Preston . One wonders , had Riel formed a successful government and state , how long before Le Corbeau would have arranged an " accident " or " assassination " ( by a " Tory " agent , of course ) of Riel , in order to cement his control over the Metis nation . So when he gets his just deserts at the end , unlike poor Louis , we are cheered by it . One has to congratulate DeMille in trying to be fair to Louis , when he could have just made his a super villain .
493034	3280905	22254	5.0	One or two good moments , but mostly forgettable	PARLOR , BEDROOM , AND BATH is not a total waste . It is always curious to see a transitional film , and this is in several ways . It is an early Buster Keaton talkie , and demonstrates how quickly the MGM brass could desert a brilliant film maker due to total lack of interest and sympathy in his abilities . Having demonstrated in THE CAMERAMAN that he was capable of working under others and turning in superior work , Keaton still did not impress his bosses . So this programmer ( there is no better way of describing it ) was given to him - and only picks up when he is able to do some athletic / inventive sight gags . The transition is also interesting for another reason - Reginald Denny . Recalled now as a usually impeccably well mannered , and elegant , British character actor ( typical role : the architect in MR . BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE ) , in the late silent film period Denny was a leading man in social comedies . This explains why , when PRIVATE LIVES was made in 1931 , he played Norma Shearer's deserted husband . As I mentioned in my review of that film , he's capable in the role , but nothing special . What is killing about his performance is that the originator of that role was a close friend of Noel Coward's : Laurence Olivier . Denny is given a role , fully as important to the plot , as Keaton . Maybe more so , as Keaton is pulled into the story by Denny's activities . Taking a backhanded flip from THE TAMING OF THE SHREW , Denny wants to marry the younger of two sisters , who won't marry unless her older sister ( the " Katerina Minola " of the plot ) marries first . While not as violent as Shakespeare's Kate , Angelica Embry ( Dorothy Christie ) is sharp tongued about men and turns them all off . She has never found one that is satisfying . Denny runs accidentally into Keaton , and decides ( for no really strong reason - a weakness in this farce ) to present him as a great lover to Angelica . The plot really is how Angelica grows interested in Keaton , and he has to be trained to be a great lover . But other women hear of his reputation , and he is pursued by them . Frankly his bridegroom pursued by hundreds of angry would-be brides in SEVEN CHANCES was funnier . Yet there are two sequences that stand out , that suggest what he might have done . One , I've noticed , is not liked in some of these reviews , but it has some sparks in it . He is told how to address Angelica , and keeps practicing " Oh , my darling . . . I love you madly . . . I want you badly . " or words to that effect . Keaton is progressively more and more bored by these idiotic words , and when practicing with Angelica's sister Virginia ( Sally Eilers ) grabs the girl about the arms , and shakes her back and forth towards and away from him . It seems at first wooden and tedious , until one realizes that Keaton is being a little subversive here . Even though the film code was not fully in place in 1931 , only an idiot would have failed to notice that when Keaton is doing this shaking , the rhythm of him and Eilers happens to resemble a couple having sex . It sort of undercuts the value of the words that Keaton is trying to use to sound soulfully romantic ! He does this several times , each time getting grimmer and grimmer and seemingly more willing to cut to the sexual climax chase . The other moment is with Charlotte Greenwood . In the film she has fainted in his hotel room , and he knows that the hotel detective ( Ed Brophy ) is trying to catch him with a woman in his room . Knowing that Brophy is headed for his room , Keaton tries to move the unconscious Greenwood into an open closet . But she's large than he is , and he can't budge her . So , he decides to do a little mechanical activity . He removes the door of the closet from it's hinges , and lays it down so he can roll Greenwood on top . Then , slowly , he pushes the door back so it looks like it is closed . Brophy and some others break in . " Where's that woman who came in here ? " , Ed demands to know . Keaton , casually leaning on the door of the closet shrugs his shoulders . He almost gets away with it until a fed up Brophy , who can't find any trace of Greenwood , grabs Keaton to get the truth out of him . Then the closet door crashes down revealing a still unconscious Charlotte , much to Brophy's surprise . Keaton liked this logical trick with doors and their hinges . He would use it years later , in a variant manner , in a comedy with Red Skelton and Esther Williams , only to have Skelton use it to confuse a nasty watch dog . But those two moments were rarities in this film . I'll give it a " 5 " for the sake of the " Great Stone Face " , but it really is a " 3 " or a " 4 " .
492652	3280905	51638	5.0	Verne's Columbiad - reduced in effect .	After TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS it is most likely that the most popular of Jules Verne's titles ( the ones that most people are familiar with ) is his 1865 novel FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON , together with it's first sequel , the 1870 novel AROUND THE MOON . What fascinates everyone is that for all the errors we now know of Verne's huge cannon idea ( it would crush and vaporize the space travelers before they left the cannon's mouth ) he was on target on so many points . He felt the Americans would do it first ( we did - though barely ) ; It would be sent from Florida ( near where Cape Kennedy is located , by the way ) ; Texas would be important in the project ( in the novel Texas wants the honor of being the site of the cannon , but in reality Nasa's central space tracking center is in Houston ) ; The capsule would be bullet shaped ( not quite correct , but look at the rockets we used ) ; The capsule would return to the earth and land in the Atlantic , to be recovered by an American battleship . Nice guesswork ( or homework ) Jules ! To be fair to Verne , even his cannon idea was not a bad one - it was more plausible than Cyrano de Bergerac's bottles of morning dew ( which his poetic fancy said would lift the traveler ) or Poe's free flying balloon in HANS PFALL . But what is not noticed by most readers ( due to translations ) is Verne's social and political satire . He liked Americans , but he recognized our bellicosity , self-image building ( we always did it better than anyone else ) and our economic and political expansionism . Verne , like many Frenchmen , supported Lincoln and the North in the Civil War , especially after the Emancipation Proclamation . In 1887 he wrote a two volume novel NORTH AND SOUTH , in which the Confederates are the villains . But he saw American enterprise as haphazard and not well planned . He was very critical of it in THE FLOATING ISLAND , where greed by American millionaires destroys a remarkable artificial island . Even in his first published novel , FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON , at a philosophical moment one of the characters says that if the world ever is destroyed an American will have a hand in it . So in the novel , the Baltimore Gun Club members are all leading engineers who helped the Northern cause by building better guns and cannon . Most of them are missing limbs as a result . The President of the club , J . P . Barbicane ( in some versions his name is " Impey " Barbicane ) has his limbs . His closest associate , the club's secretary , J . T . Maston , has most of his body , but has one hook for a hand . They are the only members with " in tact " bodies . The club is seeking something to do with it's time , after the Confederacy collapses . Barbicane suggests building the " Columbiad " ( which , by the way , is the cannon , not the projectile ) to travel or communicate with the moon . The plan is barely presented when Maston suggests using the cannon instead to annex Mexico ! See - Verne has our bellicosity down quite pat . Barbicane has a wartime rival , one Captain Nicholl . Nicholl specialized in better and better armor . Barbicane specialized in better and better shells to pierce the armor . Nicholl will soon become the leading critic of the scheme . Verne ( in real life ) was a friend of the prominent aeronaut and photographer , Nadar . Nadar became the model for the French adventurer Michel Ardan ( note the anagram last name for " Nadar " ) who proposes traveling in the projectile to the moon . Barbicane and Nicholl end up joining him ( while Maston will be in charge of carefully following their travel by powerful telescope ) . The flight actually had great accuracy in detailing the length of the trip ( four days ) and in showing the amazing effect of weightlessness ( Verne noted that by leaving the gravity field of earth this would result ) . The capsule never lands on the moon ( it couldn't , because if it had it would not have been capable of getting back . Verne explains that there is a miscalculation in the calculations of the trajectory . This enables the moon to help send the capsule back to earth . Nadar / Ardan is not in the movie . Nicholl does not become so completely involved and willing to work with Barbicane as the novel shows . George Sanders ' Stuyvesant Nicholl ( " Stuyvesant " ? ) remains hostile to Joseph Cotton's Victor Barbicane ( what happened to " Impey " ) up to a few minutes before the conclusion . There is no power X in the novel - no new energy source . The movie was made in the 1950s , so the public had to think that Verne was thinking in terms of atomic power . Actually he never did . There is no romance between the children of Sanders and Cotton . These changes in the film help weaken the film in comparison to the novel ( which still reads well - try to get the translation by Walter Miller that is the best in English ) . This was not the only film version of the novel . The classic early film by George Melies , A TRIP TO THE MOON , has a period charm that makes one forget it's cardboard backgrounds ( and it's projectile in the eye of the man in the moon is a classic moment of cinema ) . And then there was the film ROCKET TO THE MOON which turned the story into an all-star comedy with Burl Ives , Terry-Thomas , Lionel Jeffries , and Dennis Price . Verne was not finished with his travelers either , after AROUND THE MOON . In 1889 he wrote THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE , where the Gun Club decides to use the Columbiad to alter the tilt of the globe . Ardan does not reappear , but Barbicane , Nicholl , and Marston do . It is not as good a novel as the first two .
492416	3280905	209031	5.0	One of the " Holy Grails " of Missing Movies	I suspect that if HUMOR RISK was ever located , and transferred to video or DVD , it would eventually disappoint people . The problem is that only one of the four ( in 1926 five ) Marx Brothers was silent - Harpo . Groucho and Chico required sound for their types of humor , with malapropisms , puns , double entendres , and mistaken words thrown in so much . Zeppo too would have needed some type of script ( due to the parts he was playing in the five films he did with them ) . However , Zeppo ( like Harpo ) did apparently make one silent film ( though not a major one - Frank Tuttle directed it , and Ziegfeld star Ann Pennington appeared in it ) . It would be a curiosity to us if we watched it , and we would wait for it to take off . But the glorious mangling of the English tongue by Chico , and the souring confusion of metaphors and similes by Groucho would have been sorely missed . It's curious that Jobyna Rawlston , the co-star of Harold Lloyd , was in this film . Is it just possible that Lloyd or his producer Hal Roach had some hand in the production . Maybe ( if a copy survives ) it's in Lloyd's or Roach's vaults . Just a guess though . It is always welcome to see a missing film turn up , or an unexpected film turn up . For a number of years a film short with the brothers ( including Zeppo ) has popped up and been shown . It is of the four of them trying to get hired for a show and going to the agent's office . The skit ( which is in spoken and sung rhyme ) is actually the same one that would be used in a new setting in MONKEY BUSINESS where the brothers try to leave the ocean liner claiming to be Maurice Chevalier . Here they all come in wearing straw hats , trying to impress the agent . Harpo also does an interesting gag never done by him in his films . He blows up a rubber glove so that it looks like a cow's udder , " milks it into a bottle ( as his hand slowly lets the air out of the glove , then he " drinks " the milk ! Apparently the whole routine is from the brother's first Broadway hit : I'LL SAY SHE IS ! That show appeared in 1927 , before THE COCONUTS . It's nice that they saved a scene from the show .
493441	3280905	660877	6.0	An interesting little episode - with a diabolic comic conclusion	This was not a long episode of " Night Gallery , like " They're Closing Down Tim Reilly'S Bar " . It was about five minutes long , but it was quite amusing in it's conclusion . I will add this - the cast given here is erroneous . No witches appeared in the episode and Agnes Moorehead was not in it at all . Victor Buono was a very witty actor - some of his best villains have witty lines ( look at his crooked banker in " Four For Texas " , explaining politely but with some quietly mounting anger to two nice but poor ladies why he can't lend them money because they are so incompetent as business - ladies that he'd eventually have to foreclose on them , making him look like a louse ! ) . This particular episode of " Night Gallery " was actually an extended joke , well performed with finicky delicacy and dignity by Buono , until the conclusion when we realize we never understood what he was really looking for . Buono's customer has set up an appointment at a secretarial agency for possible business . He comes in with an attaché case , and is all politeness and intelligence as he asks the woman in charge of the agency who can she recommend for him . She parades her best secretary . A statuesque blond , highly gifted at stenography , typing , and well organized office directing is shown . Buono takes out a monocle and examines the young woman . He looks a bit disappointed and thanks her , and then asks if there is anyone else . The manager goes on to an attractive brunette who understands several languages , and is a whiz at Pitman shorthand , etc . Again Buono looks at the woman , with a degree of chagrin ( like saying , " Is this the best you have ? " ) . Again he thanks her , and asks the manager who else there is . Gradually Buono's impatience mounts , and the manager's confusion mounts . Each one of these women are first rate workers - what on earth is Buono after here ? After the fifth or sixth attempt , Buono just erupts . " I came here because I was told you have the best selection in the city . " , he yells , " But you parade these second-rate people so proudly ! " The manager starts sputtering out an outraged defense , when suddenly a rather poorly dressed drudge named " Ms Blodgett " ( Cherie Franklin ) comes out to empty the garbage can ( she is so clumsy she spills it on the floor , and barely picks it all up - being overweight she seems to be dropping more that picking up ) . The manager is still talking , not noticing Buono closely watching and examining Ms Blodgett as she bends over , and as she starts doing some clumsy filing as well . She leaves after a moment . " You were hiding the great jewel of your collection . " , a triumphant Buono says . The Manager is stunned and says , " You . . . you liked Ms Blodgett ? " " Why of course . . . she's exactly what I've been looking for ! " says Buono . " But she's the worst secretary we have . " , the Manager sputters . " She can barely file . Her typing is slow and full of errors ! " Buono shakes his head and says , " I won't hear anything against her . She is exactly what I want ! " The Manager pulls herself together . After all , it cures two problems : it gets rid of an incompetent employee , and it gives a difficult customer what he wants . The manager sits down at her desk and says , " Very well , where should we send her ? " In the meantime we are aware that Buono has opened his attaché case and taken some things out . " Never mind . " , he says ( a close-up showing he has a bib on and is holding cutlery ) , " I'll eat her here ! "
492271	3280905	64688	6.0	That First Monte Carlo Rally - 1924	It tries hard , and it has some energy from a few of the stars in it , but MONTY CARLO OR BUST lacks the verve of it's predecessors , THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES and THE GREAT RACE , and some of the goofiness of it's less remembered successor , ROCKET TO THE MOON . It may be the script , which lags at times , or it may be the fact that the super-nationalism of Pre-World War I Europe is not translatable in the 1920s ( oddly enough ) . The cast includes people from the two preceding films including Tony Curtis ( THE GREAT RACE ) , Terry-Thomas , Eric Sykes , and Gert Frobe ( THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN ) , and some welcomed new faces ( Susan Hampshire , Peter Cook and Dudley Moore ) . But there is less time for the character development found in the earlier films . For example , the three French female drivers and the two Italian male drivers never really have individual personalities , although one of the Italians has " topic A " constantly on his mind when he thinks of the amorous awards awaiting him if he wins . The idea is that 1924 marks the first Grand Prix to Monte Carlo across Europe . The various characters are interested in winning the race - well most of them are . Poor Gert Frobe ( in a far more sympathetic role than his pompous German Colonel in THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN ) is Willy , a well-known superior " getaway - car " driver in Germany who has been sprung from prison by the Count ( Jack Hawkins , in one of his last - really silent film parts ) . He resembles a wealthy playboy who has been entered in the rally , but has been " removed " so that Willy can replace him . A fortune in stolen jewels is in Willy's car , and it is going to be transported secretly across Europe so it can be brought to the men who can sell it . Willy doesn't mind , at first , but he resents the constant threat over his head by the Count's men ( who are everywhere ) , and he knows he could win the rally - he's a better driver than anyone else . But the Count doesn't care . SMALL SPOILER : At the conclusion , Willy is freed from the threat from the Count , and cuts loose . Although he does not get official recognition because of his fraudulently replacing the actual driver who entered , Willy actually does win the race for a few minutes . There is also the British Army Colonel , Major Digby-Dawlish ( Peter Cook ) and his batman / assistant Lt . Kit Barrington ( Dudley Moore ) . There addition to the cast actually is a recognition of two previously successful comedies this team appeared in : the original BEDAZZLED and THE WRONG BOX . Digby-Dawlish is an inventor of motorcar devices he has tested in India , and he hopes to win the rally so he can market these to the world . The devices ( like attaching skis to the car in the snowy regions ) seem to be sensible , but always come acropper - but Dawlish and Barrington never say die , and always seem to have another device to undue the chaos and damage of the first device ! Then there is the antics of Terry-Thomas and Tony Curtis . Terry-Thomas is Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage , the son of the Sir Percy Ware-Armitage who tried to cheat his way to the trophy of the 1910 London to Paris flight in THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN . Daddy has been killed at the start of the new film in the crash of another airplane , and Cuthbert is as happy as possible - he is now owner of the family industrial empire . But then he learns that daddy sold half the business to Chester Schofield ( Curtis ) , an American with ideas of his own . Ware-Armitage is not going to let a Yank control half that empire . He bets Schofield that he will beat Schofield to Monte Carlo - the winner gets to keep the entire industrial empire . Schofield agrees , not realizing that Cuthbert is as crooked and ruthless as his father was . Using ( or misusing and blackmailing ) his family retainer Perkins ( Sykes ) to do his dirty work , he also blackmails a young cousin ( Hampshire ) to vamp Schofield and make him lose interest in the race . The reduction of plot themes should have strengthened the script - but there are gaps . Chester is drugged at one point , but Hampshire gives him some medication she has and he snaps out of his sleepy behavior automatically . Perkins puts up with a lot of crap from his boss - far more than most people reasonably accept . In the end he gets a fine revenge , but it should have been earlier in the film . The film is amusing enough - but try to catch the other films in the series which were better .
491835	3280905	31996	6.0	The last moment was ridiculous	I am giving this film a " 6 " because of my fondness for Stephen Foster's melodies ( and my pity for his fate ) , and because - whatever one thinks of his racist " blackface " act , Al Jolson was a wonderful singer . If it had been shot as a concert film of Foster's best tunes , it would have been worth an " 9 " or even a " 10 " . Instead it is tied to one of those idiotic Hollywood composer biographies . It is a sub-set to Hollywood biographies , all of which have fact problems . Here it is trying to concentrate on Foster's alcoholism ( a fact ) , but not on the business problems he confronted in his career . Foster was the first American composer of lasting merit ( although his contemporary Louis Moreau Gottschalk came close ) . His compositions were totally composed by him ( including lyrics ) . But he never had any business abilities , so that while tunes like " Old Folks At Home " , " Beautiful Dreamer " , " The Camptown Races " , " I Dream of Jeannie " and " Oh Susannah " were massive popular hits , Foster got remarkably little of the profits . Added to his problems were the lack of efficient copy-write protection in the U . S . ( or on the globe , for that matter ) to prevent pirating of his work . He was also the first composer who tried to live on the successful profits of his compositions . Had he been frugal , and not a drinker , it just might have worked ( for a few years he did prosper ) , but he fumbled it . His last years were spent still composing , but living as a Bowery derelict . His end is not quite the melodrama of the film - he fell in his room cutting himself ( not cutting his throat ) . Due to his alcoholic condition weakening his body , he died a few days later in Bellevue Hospital . Don Ameche is a terrific actor , and does what he can here - but it reminds us of an extended development of his Edward Salomon ( Lillian Russell's doomed composer husband ) in the Russsell biography . He is talented - greatly so - but drink and ill health doom her here . No new extension of his acting range as Foster . By 1939 I wonder if there was increasing criticism by African - American groups regarding stereotyping in Hollywood . Probably not too much yet , or at least enough for the industry to take notice . Films about D . D . Emmett ( DIXIE ) , and other films with minstrel segments in them would still appear within the next decade . It really is not until the end of the 1940s and into the 1950s that an effect of World War II is felt - a dislike for the disparate treatment of African Americans - and begins to have an impact . So the minstrel portions , historically correct ( unfortunately ) , were totally acceptable in this film in 1939 . Oddly enough , given the accidental tragedy that ends this film , the fate of E . E . Christy is overlooked . Christy apparently had a nervous breakdown in the 1860s , and threw himself out of a window . One would not know that watching Jolson's performance , based on this script . The concluding moment of this film always stuck in my craw . Tragically announcing the death of Foster at what was supposed to be the benefit to resurrect his career , Christy / Jolson announces the first performance of Foster's latest and greatest tune . He starts singing " Old Folks At Home " ( renamed " Swanee River " - as in the film title ) , Jolson starts singing it ( remember for the first time ) . When the music reaches the chorus , " All the world is sad and weary . . . " the whole audience arose and sang it's chorus lines . Remarkable example of massive psychic transference , or poor screenplay writing : I leave it to the viewer to guess which .
493347	3280905	46759	6.0	The Man Who Popularized Trousers , and his one-time " Fat Friend "	Stewart Granger , in his prime , was damned by being too handsome and too British . It is fascinating to see the way he was used in films in England in the late 1940s and films in Hollywood in the 1950s . His countrymen recognized he was good looking , and muscular , but while he could play an adventurous rug dealer in CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA , it was a supporting part ( the male lead was the less handsome looking , but greater actor , Claude Rains ) . In CAPTAIN BOYCOTT , he played an Irish farmer and horse racer ( there the title character was a supporting character - played by Cecil Parker ) . In BLANCHE FURY he was a scheming murderer after an estate , based on the 19th Century killer James B . Rush . In THE MAN IN GREY he was one of a pair of doomed lovers ( and the main role was a Regency buck villain played by James Mason , who in venting his anger on Margaret Leighton for her evil gained the audience's support ) . In short , Granger's English roles were a wide variety of types ( they also included the violinist Paganini , and the unfortunate courtier Count Koenigsmarck ) . He had a wide variety of parts , and sometimes was not at the center of his films . Hollywood was determined that he was at the center of the films . At his best ( KING SOLOMON'S MINES , YOUNG BESS , SCARAMOUCHE ) he was given good material , and good direction , and some humor ( in SCARAMOUCHE anyway ) . But he was soon straight jacketed into costume films no matter how weak they were . Granger did occasionally break away from sword and leotard flicks , like ALL THE BROTHERS WERE VALLIANT and THE LAST HUNT and ( a little later ) NORTH TO ALASKA - a welcome comic part . But most of his Hollywood films were like BEAU BRUMMEL and FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG : Weak stories with Granger pushed into British historical costumes . BEAU BRUMMEL had been a play written at the turn of the century by America's leading dramatist of the day , Clyde Fitch . Forgotten ( somewhat unjustly today ) , Fitch was usually a social comedy writer . His best known comic play ( not revived for many decades ) was a vehicle for a young actress named Ethel Barrymore called CAPTAIN JINKS OF THE HORSE MARINES . After watching Barrymore pursue the actor portraying Captain Adolphus Jinks ( yes , that's his name ) for two and a half hours , the play was so successful that Ethel added a line at the end to still the demands for encores : " That's all there is , there isn't anymore . " Ironically , due to savage critics like Brooks Atkinson , Fitch's plays are rarely staged , so that final line is better remembered than it's play . A number of years back ( about 1986 or so ) a group of female actors put together a review , called " The Club " ( I believe that was the name ) . They were dressed in turn of the century clothing as male members of a club . Part of the review was a one act play of Fitch's . The critics felt it was quite well acted and even entertaining . Fitch was known for historical dramas as well . He wrote one on NATHAN HALE . He also wrote this play , BEAU BRUMMEL , for Richard Mansfield . It is actually a study in a dandy's fall from " greatness " or social fame into tragedy . The real Brummell was to lose his social position , his fortune , his friendship with George , Prince of Wales ( " Prinny " or " Florizel " - later George IV ) , and finally his sanity . The original play was grim . For an actor like Mansfield , who reveled in roles that emphasized opposites ( the original " Dr . Jeckyll and Mr . Hyde " ) he must have enjoyed going from plushy costumes to rags . The 1924 film version with John Barrymore as Brummel is closer to the original . Brummel was a leader of social fashion . One of the Regency figures ( including his " fat friend " the Prince ) who created the style known as " Regency " that is for the period of 1795 to 1837 . He influenced the Prince about wardrobe and social behavior - so much that George was called " The First Gentleman of Europe " . But he had no political influence . He probably had no political ideas of importance at all . The film tries to make him more important historically than he was . He was a fop who briefly influenced culture - but he did not confront William Pitt the Younger as this film suggests . In fact Prince George was not the best person to try to influence politically at all . Although in his youth he was frequently seen with Whig figures like Charles Fox ( Peter Bull in the film ) or Richard Sheridan , this was to spite his Tory father George III ( Robert Morley in this film ) . If you saw that better historical film , THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE III , the poisonous relationship of the King and his heir was shown quite well . As Prince George grew older , his basic conservatism grew . By the time he was acting Prince Regent and then King ( 1811 - 1820 ; 1820 - 1830 ) he was firmly in the Tory ranks . But Pitt the Younger was dead by then . As mentioned in another comment on this thread , Morley as the mad King , and Ustinov as the Prince ( later King ) were the best performers in this film . Poor Granger tries , but he has a terrible script to work with . They should have kept to the original - it might have been worth while as a film . For the sake of Ustinov and Morley I am giving this film a .
492553	3280905	181582	6.0	What this tells an American of our image in Asia	I'm a little surprised I gave this a " 6 " , but it a smidge better than average . I'm not a fan of the Hong Kong - Korean - Japanese - Singapore " kung fu " or martial arts films . Most are basically garbage , but then most of the westerns that were made in Hollywood are not of the HIGH NOON or STAGECOACH or SHANE standard . But it is instructive to watch one from start to finish , and to try to comprehend what is going on . Basically this is a tragedy of how the happiness of four friends is destroyed by power and greed . And the greed is centered in the good old U . S . A . ( more about that later ) . Tango and Koo are pals and Tango is in love with Blue Szeto ( who is also a friend of Koo ) . Koo is also getting married to another friend , Grace - the wedding to be held in Miami , Florida on a yacht . Most of the story is set in Hong Kong , but it has global implications . Grace works out of a Hong Kong think tank for the C . I . A . , so they are interested in who she knows . We see them spying on her and on Blue Szeto . That ought to tip us off about the view of the film maker ( and possibly his audience ) to the U . S . A . Since this film was made in 1998 - prior to the disaster of the three middle east wars - it actually is the view of the U . S . A . from Asia in the course of the more benign Clinton Administration ! The C . I . A . comes across in this film as conniving , vicious , short sided , and corrupt . When the villain behind the actual crimes and scheme here becomes known , the C . I . A . is told to lay off because , " It may be good for Wall Street ! " That is a quote from the film ! A project that was being handled by the C . I . A . Hong Kong office is facing possible destruction by government defunding . It is a method of making supermen agents out of operatives . Our four young friends and lovers know of the system , and Grace actually is seen defending it from cut-backs . The wedding in Miami turns tragic , when Grace and Szeto are isolated on a boat launch which is captured by a woman who works for a terrorist for hire named Alien . Szeto is kidnapped ( we later learn there were other kidnappings of C . I . A . people ) by helicopter , and Alien shoots Grace to death . Based on what they know , Tango and Koo offer themselves to the C . I . A . scientist on the project as guinea pigs in an effort to find Alien . They have already contacted the person at Langley to get his help , but he is one of these unsympathetic bastards in upper bureaucratic positions that always insist on moving as little or as stupidly as possible ( think of Ned Beatty in the comedy HOPSCOTCH ) . This one even looks sinister with a pointed beard . The two heroes do go through a crash course in becoming supermen . Then they invade the enemy headquarters , where Alien is working with a scientist ) . This is also one of those films where the amoral assassin and his partners remain ( until near the end ) one step ahead of everyone else . It turns out that the man behind the scheme is a big time media mogul ( a Murdoch-clone , or Turner-clone ) with a Jewish name ( Rosenbloom ) , who is scheming to use subliminal messages sent over his satellite system throughout Asia to cause massive rioting and unrest for his own fun and profit ( he even is quoted as saying , " Should be fun ! " ) . Remember , this is supposed to be good for Wall Street . I am trying to figure out how - it's never explained but taken for granted . To add to the problem of the story , the C . I . A . idiot who is a secondary villain arrests Szeto , Koo , and Tango because they have " gummed up the works " ( although they actually broke open the case and rescued all the kidnapped C . I . A . personnel ) . In a crazy moment Koo manages to break free , grabs a gun , and in defending himself shoots several C . I . A . agents ( to the applause of the audience I imagine ) . His adrenaline is up , as is that weird untried training system . Tango has been handcuffed to a bench , but Szeto tries to stop Koo , and he accidentally kills her . Koo escapes . Tango is " treated " at Langley to forget much , but to be used to kill Koo for murdering Szeto . The last half hour of the film is Koo trying to reach out to Tango ( at least temporarily ) to stop the scheme and to get Alien . The acting is tolerable , and towards the end even a trifle sad in seeing what the C . I . A . did to Tango and Koo . The story , aside from going into bizarre heights to attack our secret police agency ( there are subtler ways to do so ) actually is coherent . Interestingly Mr . Rosenbloom is never seen paying for his share of the crimes as his cohorts do - maybe Wall Street ( far healthier in 1998 than now ) protected one of its own ! !
492044	3280905	121610	6.0	Paging Thornton Wilder	My memories of this production are over twenty years old now - it was pushed by PBS because it seemed a good production and the play by Johann Nestoy ( 19th Century Austria's greatest dramatist ) was the ancestor of Thornton Wilder's THE MERCHANT OF YONKERS turned into THE MATCHMAKER turned into HELLO , DOLLY ! It was a good production , particularly Felicity Kendall's " pants " role of the larking junior clerk Christopher ( her scene ordering food at the restaurant as though she were to the manor born was wonderful ) , but one performance was totally annoying . Dimsdale Laden's Zangler ( the model for Wilder's Vandergelder ) was annoying . Either the performer ( or in this case , the director ) made the character so fatuous that one could not believe he had a head for business . Both Paul Ford and Walter Matthau in their respective performances as Vandergelder showed business competence as well as self-importance . They were believable , while Laden was improbable . From the start of his first line he seemed to contradict every sentence he said by repeating it from the center or going around to a different point of view immediately . And doing it with the most vacant faced grinning smile I have ever seen in a performance . Only once did that smile end , and the face seem ( momentarily ) funny and human - when he is presented with the bill for all the characters at the restaurant , he suddenly got bugged-eyed and upset ( and , best of all , at a loss for words ) . Too bad that approach could not be used more frequently in his case . He drags this play production down from a possible 8 or 9 to a 6 .
493324	3280905	592465	7.0	The President Who Tried To Keep Fighting	One day this story should be told properly - it is a tale which would leave mixed emotions because of what the men involved believed it , and yet it showed great determination on the part of the central figure . On May 10 , 1865 , at Dansville , Georgia , a Union cavalry troop captured a number of suspected Rebels . Although the Civil War's fighting was over , and Lee and Joe Johnston had surrendered , the North was in a particularly vicious mood - Lincoln had been assassinated by Booth , and there was evidence of a conspiracy that might go up to the highest echelons of the South . So Northern soldiers were looking for certain missing people : the leaders of the Confederate Government . That day at Dansville they hit the jackpot - they met a bunch of Confederates carrying gold and money in the value of about $150 , 000 . 00 in 1865 ( it would be in the millions today ) . But the leader of the bunch of refugees was Mr . Jefferson Davis , formerly U . S . Senator from Mississippi , Secretary of War under his friend President Franklin Pierce , and first and only elected President of the Confederate States of America . It was , in 1865 , identical in national impact to the capture three years ago of Saddam Hussein of Iraq near Takrit by American soldiers . This episode of THE GREAT ADVENTURE dealt with the decision by Davis ( Michael Rennie ) not to surrender , despite Robert E . Lee's avowed intention of surrendering . On April 2 , 1865 , Davis got word that Lee's forces had been surprised by Phil Sheridan's forces at the battle at Five Forks , and the defenses at Petersburg were fatally punctured . This meant that Richmond could not longer be defended , and that the Confederate capital would soon be in Union hands . Davis called a quick cabinet meeting , and took stock of what options are left . He decided to keep fighting . Lee could keep Grant occupied for a week - Davis would go to Joe Johnston's army in North Carolina to continue the fight . Taking the Confederate treasury , Davis gave orders to destroy all military stores in Richmond ( unfortunately this started an uncontrollable fire that destroyed much of the city before the Northern troops put it out ) . He , his wife , and several cabinet people and soldiers head south through Virginia into North Carolina . Unfortunately , although one step ahead of the Yankees , Davis found Generals Joe Johnston and Pierre Beauregard far more realistic on assessing the chances of the war continuing as Davis hoped . Johnston finally dashed the chances there in Carolina by saying he was asking Sherman for terms of surrender . Davis kept going through South Carolina and into Georgia . He hoped to reach the coast , board some boat to the coast of Texas , and link up with Generals Edmund Kirby-Smith and Richard Taylor ( his ex-brother-in-law ) commanding the last large army of the Confederacy . But that Yankee patrol caught him . Rennie gave a moving performance - a highly respectable actor he could not fail in such a part . His Davis ( like his real-life model ) was a determined man , who could not stand facing unpleasant truths , but would do all in his power to keep his hope for Confederate nationhood alive . But it was not to be allowed by fate and Northern military might . Most readers ( including myself ) probably feel it was just as well he failed - after all , his government was supporting slavery . But keep in mind , Lee had finally prodded ( far too late ) the Confederate government to give conditional freedom to slaves who volunteered to serve as soldiers for the South in March 1865 . But it did take so long because Davis and his government really hated the idea . Still he had guts in pushing despite the hopelessness of his task to the end . And he did not get proper recognition for years of his in-your-face fight . Rumor spread by Northern foes said he was found dressed as a woman when captured - this was unfair . He was taken back to Virginia , and imprisoned in Fortress Monroe for a treason trial . Poor health conditions raised the conscience of the nation about his treatment . Finally Horace Greeley stood bail for him , and Davis waited for the treason trial . It never came . He spent the last two decades of his life pursuing business opportunities in the South , and writing his memoirs defending his actions as the Confederate leader . His death in 1889 was marked by mourning by white southerners , and he did ( until recent post - 1960 decades ) get treated as a hero by them with his birthday celebrated as a " national holiday " . Could he have succeeded ? No . As Rennie finds out at the conclusion of the episode , Kirby - Smith and Taylor surrendered a week before he was captured .
493393	3280905	56575	7.0	The Only Doris Day - Cary Grant Film . . . and the Only One to Answer a Sports Trivia Question	Question : Name the film where Art Passarella , famous baseball umpire , tosses out five celebrities from a game . Answer : THAT TOUCH OF MINK . Passarella tosses out Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris , Yogi Berra , Cary Grant , and Doris Day from a game , because of some rule infraction caused by Day ( who is in the dugout with the others during a game ) , and then for escalating reasons in which the three Yankees deny any infraction . The reason Doris and Cary are in the dugout is that they are attending a Yankee Game ( Cary has some stock in the Yankees - this film was in the period before George Steinbrenner took control of the baseball team . Grant is a multi-millionaire whose limousine has damaged Days ' clothing by spraying her when the car went through a puddle . He ( at first ) just wants to repair the damage but he slowly falls for her . But Day is acting like . . . well like Day usually does ; She is a NYC career woman , and does not want to be the victim of hanky-panky from any man . She is egged on in this by her closest friend , Audrey Meadows . Grant slowly uses his considerable economic muscles to get Day to agree to a trip to the Caribbean , but he finds having her there is not the same thing as getting to know her physically there . This film is loaded with nice bits by the supporting players . One of the other reviews points out John Astin as an obnoxious suitor for Day , whom ( at the end ) she does willingly go out to a motel in New Jersey with , only to have him fail to score when Grant shows up . But also see this for Gig Young , as Grant's secretary , who finds that Grant's effortless economic and social success are undermining Young's delicate mental balance . See it too for Alan Hewitt , as Young's therapist , who finds that it really pays to have Young as a client ( because of all the great stock market tips the naive secretary blabs to the Doctor ) . Their last moment on screen together is quite funny , when Young is gushing over the baby he is watching ( actually Grant and Day's child ) and Hewitt is momentarily left thinking that somehow Young and Grant had a baby together . Finally , the late John Fiedler has a good moment as a newlywed husband who concludes that a man's best friend is his mother . An easy to take Day sex romp , I recommend it for the amusement it generates . The baseball trivia connection is also a reason ( though a minor one ) to watch the film at least once .
491603	3280905	24044	7.0	Mr . Hearst and his Political Confusions .	In some way historians can argue that certain figures in our history should have had a chance to become President . Senator Robert Taft deserved an opportunity to show his abilities in that job , as did Senators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster and Robert La Follette . Mistakes , political miscalculations , and sheer chance prevented their elections ( and in Taft's case even his nomination ) . But while there is a general feeling of pity for those four gentlemen in failing to reach the White House , most historians agree that William Randolph Hearst did not fully deserve to even approach it . Hearst was extremely good at building up a newspaper empire , and of creating an exciting and stimulating model for the modern newspaper . But his overwhelming desire to reach the White House became such a joke that he became known as " William - Also Ran - dolph Hearst " . Problem with Hearst was that he enjoyed playing with public opinion and guiding it , but he also enjoyed . . . well enjoyed living the life of a remarkably wealthy man . His father George Hearst was a prospector who found one of the great gold mines in the west and rose to the post of U . S . Senator from California ( ironically , a higher national office than his son ever reached ) . The image of Hearst from CITIZEN KANE of the boy whose father was a drinker , and whose mother signs over to the boy ownership of the mine is not true . In the course of doing business , Hearst Sr . got ownership of the San Francisco Enquirer , and Willy ( who'd been tossed out of several colleges ) asked to run it . George allowed Willy to do that , and Willy found his true métier . His bug to become President never left him . He did win a Congressional seat from New York City in 1901 , and held it for two terms . But by then his yellow journalism made so many enemies that he was ignored in Congress ( when he decided to show up - he really could not apply himself to the job of Congressman ) . Yet in 1904 he managed to gather over 200 delegates for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency . Unfortunately he could not get the two thirds majority needed , and the delegates nominated Chief Justice Alton Brooks Parker of New York State's Court of Appeals ( who was thrashed by Teddy Roosevelt in the election ) . Possibly , had Hearst got nominated , it would have enabled him to rid himself of Presidentialitis . That was not to be the case . He would run for Mayor of New York , Governor of New York , and seek a nomination ( in the 1920s ) for Senator from New York . He never won any of these elections , and he did not get nominated for Senator . His influence in the 1932 Democratic Convention was thrown to FDR , but he subsequently broke with the newly elected 32nd President . Hearst , in his career , had pushed for better conditions for the poor , and better treatment of Labor . He had been hard on the trusts . He opposed our entry into World War I and Wilson's League of Nations . All of this is familiar from Welles ' CITIZEN KANE . But his views turned rightward after 1915 . Being German , his anti-war views ( however wise they may have been ) were colored by a pro-German viewpoint . His pro-labor point of view turned sour as he faced more and more serious financial problems ( especially in the Depression ) . He did , however , think that the government of the day was inept in handling the Depression , and thought stronger measures were needed . So he financed and produced GABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE . His solution was that the President must seize power , despite that antiquated series of checks and balances called the Constitution , and force relief in the form of jobs on the public . This mirrors part of FDR's New Deal ( like the CCC , which built public roads ) , but FDR did try to get this legislation through Congress in the first 100 days . Hearst also was against expensive military build-ups . He has Walter Huston force " THE WASHINGTON COVENANT " on Europe and the World , which will reduce the armed navies . Actually ( and somewhat intelligently ) he shows that the large battleships are dinosaurs - Gregory La Cava uses film of Billy Mitchell's sinking of old battleships by aircraft from 1921 in the movie to demonstrate this . But it is doubtful that in real life such a treaty could be forced on anyone . They would resent the strong arm lecturing involved . The film is fascinating despite the ridiculous populist - cum - fascist viewpoint . It helps that Walter Huston is playing the President , as he certainly gives whatever juice he has into such a thankless role ( from hack politician to injured car passenger to international savior ? ) . The rest of the cast seems adequate , though C . Henry Gordon does what he can to make his gangster boss seem villainous enough ( including a drive by shooting near the White House ) . I give the film a seven out of 10 , as an interesting curiosity , and a quick look into the mind of one of our most fascinating millionaires .
492314	3280905	43827	7.0	Hope's First Glimmer of Trouble .	As an entertaining comedy for Bob Hope , MY FAVORITE SPY is one of the best films in his career . It is typical for his normal plot line - a glib , slightly sleazy coward is forced into some job in which he conflicts with dangerous types . He manages to bungle his way to victory . It was the plot line for MY FAVORITE BLONDE , MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE , THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE , MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE . THE LEMON DROP KID , PALEFACE , SON OF PALEFACE , SORROWFUL JONES , even FANCY PANTS . In each film he'd be assisted by the heroine ( Jane Russell , Dorothy Lamour , Lucille Ball , or whoever ) , and would confront serious villains like Bruce Cabot , Lloyd Nolan , Charles Dingle , Walter Slezak , Joseph Schildcraut , Otto Preminger , and Peter Lorre . In each of these films the villain is interested in money , stolen secrets , the chance at marrying the heroine , or power . The comedy would center on Hope's behavior and antics , sometimes pulling in the heroine and the villains as accidental recipients of Hope's blunders ( like his attempt to give Lucille Ball a special hairdo in FANCY PANTS ) . If he confronts the villain the villain might be temporarily discomforted ( like Schildkraut is momentarily in the duel sequence in BEAUCAIRE ) . But the villain is normally captured by outside forces running to Hope's rescue - he is incapable of beating the villains by himself ( in FANCY PANTS he just barely beats Bruce Cabot with an assist by Teddy Roosevelt - John Alexander ) . It is all familiar , but Hope is still in top form . It was in MY FAVORITE SPY ( 1951 ) that Hope finally got a glimmer of trouble in his paradise . The trouble was from his co-star : Hedy Lamarr . Hedy Lamarr's movie career , unfortunately , is considered something of a joke today . From the start of it , her classic pornographic masterpiece ECSTASY , her critics considered her solely as a beautiful woman with little talent - a wooden actress . This is very unfair , because when given good direction and a top script ( H . M . PULHAM , ESQ . , THE STRANGE WOMAN , SAMSON AND DELILAH ) she proved a first rate actress . Maybe she was not " Oscar " caliber , but she was close to it on these occasions . Moreover , Lamarr had brains . She actually is one of the few actresses who holds a patent . She was determined to show her best acting if she could . When Hope made a comedy he chose actresses who were perfectly willing to be second bananas to him . Even long time " Road Film " partner Dorothy Lamour reacted to his comedy in their movies ( in her case she usually could also depend on co-star Bing Crosby in those films ; but she made MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE with Hope alone ) . It was rare for any of these actresses to act zany in his films . Hope liked it that way . He appreciated being at the center of attention in his films . But with MY FAVORITE SPY he discovered that the formula would not totally work . Lamarr rarely had a chance to play pure comedy ( HEAVENLY BODY with William Powell was more typical of the quiet comedies that she got cast in ) . She was determined to really be Hope's equal in this film - and Hope had problems with that . In the plot of MY FAVORITE SPY , Lamarr was an adventuress named Lily Dalbray who had formerly been romanced by spy and thug Eric Augustine ( Hope - playing a rather unscrupulous villain for a change ) . Augustine is injured while going to retrieve valuable microfilm , and the government find that he resembles a burlesque comic named Peanuts White ( Hope again ) . They force White to go in place of Augustine . Lily has been hired by Eric's old rival and enemy Karl Brubaker ( Francis Sullivan ) to romance and stop or thwart Augustine . The film follows the mix-up , with Hope assisted by a government agent Tasso ( Arnold Moss ) . As I mentioned before the film is very entertaining , but Hope had problems he never experienced before . Lamarr insisted on equal comic time to Hope , especially in the conclusion - a slapstick chase involving a fire and a fire engine . Her performance in the film actually shows that she was enjoying slapstick . But most of her performance actually ended on the cutting room floor . Hope had control of the production , and saw to it . Lamarr protested but Hope had legal right to it . Lamarr never forgave Hope , and never appeared opposite him again in film ( unlike other leading ladies ) or on his television specials . The film showed Francis Sullivan to good form as the forbidding Brubaker - who actually so hates Augustine that he tries to shoot him at the conclusion of the film . Although made by Paramount , one wonders if Sullivan was the original choice for the role . One can imagine Sidney Greenstreet playing Brubaker as well . Possibly Greenstreet was thought of for the film , but either was in poor health or had other commitments . Arnold Moss also does well as Tasso , having to deal with that hopeless simpleton Peanuts White . As I said Hope's film is entertaining , but he was put on notice that his formula could not last if he had problems with his cast . The next time it happened he was unable to control the filmed appearance of his co-star . It was Katherine Hepburn in THE IRON PETTICOAT .
492217	3280905	23960	7.0	A Social Drama Curiosity of the 1930s	This was the second of the series of re-released , long missing films shown on Wednesday , April 2 , 2007 on Turner Classic films . RAFTER ROMANCE had a good deal of pleasant humor still going for it , and A MAN'S JOURNEY has some wonderful performances and a good story . But DOUBLE HARNESS , although it has two good performances ( especially Ann Harding's ) from it's leads has a script that most people would not accept . Family and filial devotion are still big matters to people today , but this film stretches these points way out of proportion . Harding is the older of the two daughters of Henry Stephenson . The younger one is Lucille Brown . As the film begins we see Harding with Stephenson and Brown buying Brown's wedding trousseau . Stephenson is a decent sort ( when was he not in most of his films ? ) but he has never been really astute about money matters , and so he is only able to afford $5 , 000 . 00 ( 1933 dollars , of course ) for the weddings of both daughters together . But dear little Brown is spending more than her $2 , 500 . 00 share . Harding realizes this , and is a good sport - she let's this shopping spree eat up more than of the total . After all , little sister is getting married . Harding is asked by Stephenson and by Brown about her own marriage plans . She has been dating William Powell , a well-known playboy type , but one who actually has a business - a potentially important shipping line that Powell has allowed to be run by others , and is now somewhat shabby . It turns out that Harding actually has her own agenda . She sees that marriage by itself ( supposedly based on love ) is insufficient , unless the wife can be of use to bring out the best in the husband not only at home but in his career ( this film is very much a 1930s film - the idea of the woman building her career is not part of the picture ) . Powell is enjoying dating Harding , and it goes beyond a casual , more typical affair of a few days or weeks . But she sets him up ( with the aid of her sister and Stephenson ) . Powell has brought her to his apartment on several occasions ( and we imagine it is for more than the cocktails served to them by his butler , Reginald Owen ) , but one night Stephenson shows up as the angry , red-faced father ( signalled to come by Brown after Harding calls Brown up ) . Stephenson acts as though he is furious , and wants to know the intentions of both Powell and Harding : how do they feel about each other , and will they marry or not ? Harding admits she loves Powell , and would marry him , but it is up to him to decide . Flummoxed by the suddenness of the situation , Powell says he wants to marry too . So now the marriage can go through . Now the title of the film is understandable , as the marriage is the " double harness " of the couple . But the problems are these . No matter how fond he is of Harding , and willing to go through the forms , Powell intends it to be a short duration marriage . Harding is discovering that she is slowly falling in love with Powell , and is also aware that he expects her to divorce him within a six months of their return from their honeymoon ( on one of his cruise lines ships ) . She gets to work to remake him racing against time - if she can domesticate him ( and make him see he likes it ) she can save the marriage . She also starts pushing him to get re-involved with the shipping line , and he starts taking charge of it ( and it starts improving ) . Only two things may derail Harding's plans . One is the reappearance of one of the wealthy women ( Lillian Bond ) who thrived with Powell ( or seemed to do so ) when he was a playboy . She starts being seen around town with Powell , although he is simply being polite in taking her to lunch at such . The other thing is Lucille Brown . Her marriage to George Meeker is in jeopardy ( again we see no scenes about this ) because she can't curb her spendthrift ways . Apparently they had a heavy duty argument at one point , when he agreed to pay off a big clothing bill , a few months after the marriage - he telling her that she better change as he was not rich enough to stand this kind of extravagance . Brown manages to sponge off Harding ( using up all of Harding's private money ) but still coming back for more . It seems there is a $1 , 000 . 00 debt that is owed , and Brown can't face Meeker about it . Harding pawns a ring for $500 . 00 ( Brown is upset that the pawnbroker did not pay her the full value of the ring - as though a pawnbroker would ! ) . But Brown is spoiled and rotten enough to consider either borrowing the money from Powell ( without telling Harding ) or going to a male admirer ( Hugh Huntley ) and " making an arrangement " with him for the money . Harding's and Stephenson's affection for Brown as a member of their family is understandable , but both know she's a selfish , spoiled brat . She does considerable damage in the film - and it is a weakness ( I'd call it a serious weakness ) that she never really suffers the consequences about it while others do suffer . Somehow that would not pass these days . Otherwise the performances of the two leads ( especially the under-appreciated Harding ) makes the film quite watchable . Also good is Owen , as the perfect butler / valet , who has a funny sequence at one of the most disastrous dinner parties in movie history .
492039	3280905	95373	7.0	An interesting misfire on the Lawrence - Lee play	This 1988 version of INHERIT THE WIND tried a slightly different approach to the story than the film or the 1965 versions . Apparently there was a deeper delving into the historical material ( and - unlike the period of the film and the first dramatic version on television - the resurgence of anti - evolutionary voters in the country ) to make the story fairer . Jason Robards played Drummond / Darrow very well - in the tradition of Muni , Tracy , and Melvyn Douglas . But it was the performance of Kirk Douglas as Brady / Bryan that was unique . As I have mentioned elsewhere in these reviews , Bryan did have valid reasons to dislike Darwinism aside from religious feelings . The issue of Social Darwinism , created by an English elitist snob named Herbert Spencer , had been grabbed by various people in power positions in big business and politics that suggested that the best people were the top of the evolutionary tree - and that big business had the right to destroy small competitors due to " survival of the fittest " . Bryan hated this idea , as opposite to Jeffersonian Democracy . He actually intended , after his own humiliation on the witness stand by Darrow to put Darrow on the stand to explain his acceptance of Social Darwinism . Judge Raulston , the trial judge , refused to allow this . If that had been brought out in this production , it would have set it apart and given a more balanced view of the two parties who clashed in Dayton . Instead , Douglas played Brady like a revivalist ( similar to Begley , without Begley's physical resemblance to Bryan ) . But he also kept trying to keep up the friendly feelings that Darrow and Bryan had when both were fighting on the same side on political issues from 1893 to 1908 . While all the productions include those moments of nostalgia between them , this attempted to suggest that Douglas / Brady hoped to " save " the soul of Robards / Drummond . It was a curious idea , but it just did not seem realistic ( given their diametrically opposite views on evolution and the Tennessee law ) . I give this a 7 for the production but the approach was a misfire .
491877	3280905	52278	7.0	Clark Gable's Twilight Quartet of Films	Between 1958 and 1961 Clark Gable appeared in four final movies that were somewhat unusual . Three of them were sex comedies , and the co-stars in them were far younger than he was . The fourth was a straight drama , which also had a female co-star who was far younger than him . These were BUT NOT FOR ME , TEACHER'S PET , IT STARTED IN NAPLES , and THE MISFITS . His co-stars were Carol Baker ( and Lili Palmer ) , Doris Day , Sophia Loren , and Marilyn Monroe . The age difference was quite unusual ( up to this time Gable's leading ladies were about ten to fifteen years within his age - in fact , Lili Palmer's appearance in BUT NOT FOR ME was to give his character a perfect mate to end up with . Most film lovers tend to only recall the last of this quartet because of it being Gable and Monroe's last movie ( although Monroe did begin SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE soon after , but didn't complete it ) . THE MISFITS also has the added downer of being the only film either of them did with Montgomery Clift . But most of all , Gable's death so soon after the shooting of THE MISFITS ended is linked to his difficult scene where he helped to control a wild horse ( the effect on the actor , immediately after the scene was shot , is evidence of his over-exertions ) . With so much of a downer atmosphere generated by this film his three previous comedies sort of pale in comparison . This is unfair because they were good comedies . I have discussed BUT NOT FOR ME elsewhere . TEACHER'S PET is possibly the most satiric of the three films ( although certain points about the entertainment industry and play production get spoofed in BUT NOT FOR ME , and Italian-American culture shock gets a zing in IT STARTED IN NAPLES ) . TEACHER'S PET is set in New York City , where Gable ( James Gannon ) is the city editor of a major newspaper . Some of the comments on this thread suggest Gannon is a hack . He's not , but just a very smart newsman who has spent a lifetime learning how a newspaper functions . At the start of the film , he is involved with Vivian Nathan ( Mrs . Kovacs , the newspaper building's cleaning lady ) and Nick Adams ( her son , Barney ) , in trying to settle the issue of whether or not Barney should be given a chance to be a reporter on the paper . Mrs . Nathan does not want him to leave school , but Barney is anxious to begin . It is from this that Gannon discovers that modern news reporters don't learn the business from the bottom up , but go to journalism classes . He is recommended to go to see the classes of Doris Day ( Erica Stone ) , because she has been making some critical comments about how Gannon runs his paper . Pretending to be a person who just wants to better himself , Gannon signs in on Stone's classes , and rapidly rises to the top of her students . She thinks she has found a truly brilliant amateur . He is enjoying her being totally fooled , as he originally intends to reveal his real identity to her class at the right time . But he gradually falls in love with Stone ( and she finds herself , typically , fighting this ) . His only rival is a psychiatrist friend of Stone , Gig Young ( Dr . Hugo Pine ) , whom he finds almost indestructible to larger and larger amounts of alcohol when the three are out at a night spot . The situation can't last too long , for Erica discovers his identity . At the same time , Gannon discovers Erica's secret : Her love of journalism is due to her family , as her father was a famous newspaper editor named Joel Barlow Stone . Gannon finds Erica considers him stupid , and it is only when he talks to Pine about it that he realizes that his accumulated knowledge of the newspaper world is as impressive as the knowledge that Erica brings to her students from her books . But he still is in the doghouse with Erica - possibly more so when he studies old copies of her father's Midwestern newspaper , and questions how good a newspaper editor he really was ! How they resolve the film I leave to the viewers ( whom I urge watch it ) . I just to want to discuss one point : who is the original for Joel Barlow Stone ? Firstly , the name " Joel Barlow " is one of those forgotten figures of early American Literatrue . Joel Barlow was one of the " Hartford Wits " of the period from 1780 - 1800 . They wrote satiric verses and pieces , most of which nobody ever reads anymore . This happens to be part of the irony about her father that Erica is taught ( surprisingly ) by Gannon . This editor father is obviously based on William Allan White , the famous Midwestern editor of the EMPORIA GAZETTE ( from Kansas ) , who flourished as a major figure in literary and political America from 1890 to 1947 ( when he died ) . White ( like Joel Barlow Stone ) is best remembered for his editorials , several of which won national awards . He was also an author of several memoirs and historical works ( such as his popular biography of President Calvin Coolidge , A PURITAN IN BABYLON ) . But the resemblance is only skin deep . White was an astute newspaperman , and his newspaper was deeply involved with current events and political trends in the U . S . Gannon discovers that as an editor White's fictional opposite number Joel Barlow Stone left a lot to be desired .
492968	3280905	48034	7.0	Van Johnson's love rival	This is not a great film , but it is better than many critics said it was when the 1999 remake came out . THE END OF THE AFFAIR was one of the key novels of Graham Greene in the 1950s that delved into his intense Catholicism . With a background of World War II , neighbors Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles ( Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr ) have a deep , passionate romance . But they are separated for a year or so , and when they try to resume the relationship ( or when Johnson tries to resume the relationship - Kerr seems relatively hesitant ) . It turns out that , due to personal experiences , Kerr has had a religious revelation . She is listening to a Catholic priest . She is also trying to help a man with a deformity ( a birthmark ) on his face who hates God . She is also concerned about the spiritual health of Johnson and of her actual husband Henry ( Peter Cushing , in a very moving - and non-horrific role ) . The film shows how Kerr affects all the lives around her , even beyond her death after a short illness ( as the novel does ) . Yes , it is too talky - novels about ideas ( and here it is the age old question of what is real love , the spiritual or the profane ) usually are . Greene , good Catholic exponent that he was , would have said that Kerr's devotion to her God was an outpouring of divine true love to her fellow creatures . Her death is not a tragedy . But Greene the novelist and part-time realist cannot leave it there . Johnson's character is bitter at the end of this remarkable novel , and at the end of the film . And his bitterness is directed at the source of that love that triumphed over his profane one .
492961	3280905	28511	7.0	The Best of Maxwell Anderson	I like this film . It is an interesting retelling of a point of view regarding one of America's most controversial trials - the 1921 - 1927 legal ordeal of Nicolo Sacco and Bartholomeo Vanzetti for the murder of two men in a payroll robbery in Massachusetts . Both were Italian anarchist immigrants in the U . S . Both were convicted by juries which were local Yankee in make-up , not having any non-Yankees on them . Certainly no Italian Americans . The judge , Webster Thayer , was an openly bigoted man . But thousands of people around the country and the world attacked the verdict , and demanded a retrial . Among those who attacked the trial was George Bernard Shaw , Edna St . Vincent Millay , Sinclair Lewis , Fiorello La Guardia , and ( in a move that opened his later great judicial career ) Felix Frankfurter . After going through appeals , and the revelations of a fellow prisoner that the payroll robbery was committed by a local criminal gang , the matter was left to a small commission headed by President Lowell of Harvard College . It turned out to be a whitewash . In the end , the two men were electrocuted . Thayer's and Lowell's reputations never recovered from this . Scholars on the case are still divided on the guilt or innocence of the two defendants - some have suggested they were both railroaded , or that Sacco was more likely to be guilty , but Vanzetti was probably innocent . Today , nearly eighty years after their deaths they still remain a flash point regarding American bigotry . In 1977 , on the 50th Anniversary of their deaths , Governor Michael Dukakis formally pardoned both men . Maxwell Anderson wrote about the subject twice : the play WINTERSET and the play HIGH TOR . Anderson's reputation as a dramatist has been inflated over the years by critics like Brooks Atkinson . He could occasionally write a well done play , but he was not on the level of his contemporary Eugene O'Neill . O'Neill's tragedies ( especially his final ones ) was based on personal demons from his family and his life . O'Neill was also willing to experiment on stage with masks ( THE GREAT GOD BROWN ) or with internal counter-dialogs ( STRANGE INTERLUDE ) or even with trilogies based on Greek originals ( MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA ) . Anderson only experimented one way - he tried blank verse plays ( ELIZABETH THE QUEEN , MARY OF Scotland ) , and did not do it too well . But here he obviously was passionately determined to defend the memory of the two Italian - American anarchists . His plot is based on developing the thread of the confession ( mentioned above ) that the murders were planned by a local criminal gang . The gang's leader is Eduardo Cianelli , a brutal criminal who framed the two men by stealing their car as the getaway car . But the strength of the confession is furthered by claiming the judge was bribed ( Thayer was biased but not bribed ) . Edward Ellis ( best recalled as the missing inventor in THE THIN MAN ) is the corrupt jurist , who is now a wandering derelict . Vanzetti's famous final letter from the death cell ( an elegant final comment that is the basis of contention between Henry Fonda and Eugene Palette in THE MALE ANIMAL ) is the basis for the elegant denunciation of the judge in the court by John Carridine ( note that his character's first name is also Bartholomeo ) . Ironically , today , it is believed that elegant final message of Vanzetti may have been written in part by a reporter who supported the defendants . The son and daughter of the dead men ( Burgess Meredith and Margo ) are seeking to prove their innocence . But they run against the determination of Cianelli , and his goons . The film is fascinating enough , and concludes satisfactorily ( much more than the actual case did ) . The plot's conclusion also leads to a more prosaic point - if you plan to use a signal to destroy someone , don't forget that signal and use it yourself . See the film to understand that last point .
493166	3280905	50363	7.0	An nice family travelogue picture	This film has a soft spot in me - the film was one of the first movies I ever attended in a movie house . Probably my parents took me to see it because Jon Provost was in it , and I was a fan of the series LASSIE . However it was on a double bill , and I believe it was with PETER PAN ( the first Disney cartoon I saw in a movie house ) . I know I enjoyed it . A boy of three or four can barely remember details , but this film was very colorfully shot . It was one of a series of films of all types ( SAYONARA , THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI , A MAJORITY OF ONE ) where Hollywood was trying to make amends to the Japanese for the caricatures of their military and leaders that were shown in the 1940s . The plot was that Provost gets separated from his parents in an accident off Japan , and ends up with a Japanese family . Soon he is paling around with that family's son , and they are unaware of the efforts by the U . S . and Provost's family to find him . Instead , when the police seem to be trying to catch him , Provost and his friend jump to the conclusion that they've done something criminal , and they run away . The film follows their constantly just escaping the police , until the conclusion ( reminiscent of the conclusion in THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING ) where everyone has to rescue the boys from a roof . It was a very exciting conclusion ( and the music in those last moments helped really build up the suspense ) . It was a good film , and a welcome introduction for the younger version of me to the pleasures of watching movies .
492272	3280905	604413	7.0	A Story Based On Truth	This episode of HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET was odd because it had been based on a true story that went the rounds between 1994 and 1998 . Steve Allan and Jayne Meadows are a married couple who always seem to be arguing and then go through a ritual when the argument gets very hot : Allan goes to a closet and pulls out his shotgun , and aims it at Meadows , firing it ( there is no charge in it ) . Meadows falls , pretending she is killed , and Allan rushes over to her to apologize to her before she " dies " . So all is forgiven about their crazy weekly quarrel . But one day when they go through the entire formula , Meadows stumbles just as Allan fires the supposedly empty gun . Only this time the gun fires a charge , but since Meadows has hit the ground before it was fired , Allan's shot goes through the window . But just at that moment a man is falling from the roof , and he gets the shot through him - killing him ! . The police come and arrest a shaken Allan . He can't understand how the gun was loaded - he never loads it ! The police are appalled by the weird circumstances here . Is it an attempted murder of Meadows ? Is it a murder with depraved indifference or a manslaughter of the man who was shot and killed ? And who is he - there was no identification on the body . The A . D . A . is talking shop with her friends and those police not in on the case . And it gradually unravels . First , the man who was shot was definitely an attempted suicide - he was seen carefully going to the roof , and purposely jumping off . So does that lessen the fault of Allan . Possibly , but Allan still was going through the intentional motions of threatening to fire and kill a target ( Meadows ) even though he hit a second target . Yes , they are aware that Allan was claiming that he did not load the gun , but he could be lying . Then it turns out that earlier in the day Allan and Meadow's son was visiting them , and that he was arguing about them lending him some money he needed for his business . They refused because he had lost all the money they lent him earlier . He was aware of their weekly argument game , and he was alone in the room with the weapon for a few minutes . He knew how to load the gun . Possibly he loaded it . His fingerprint is on the gun . They should speak to him . That's just it - he's vanished . Has he fled ? Gradually , however , it all falls into place . After checking the possible places that the son could have fled to , someone notices the fingerprint does look familiar . It looks like the fingerprint of the suicide . They check , and now they know the son jumped off the roof . So now , instead of an attempted murder of Meadows , Allan can be tried for the murder of the son . . . or can he ? The son loaded the rifle . The son's finances were messed up . He threatened to have his parents committed if they did not help him , or , to commit suicide . The A . D . A . explains that the son loaded the rifle , intending his father would kill the mother , and go to prison , Then he went to the roof to jump off and kill himself . He just did not realize the rifle he loaded would be fired and kill him instead . So Allan is not arrested - it is , after all , suicide . The story actually happened , not in Baltimore ( where HOMICIDE took place in ) but in another part of the country in March 1994 . The plotter was one Ronald Opus , and the story was told by Dr . Don Harper Mills at the 1994 annual awards dinner for Forensic Science , AAFS
491709	3280905	41610	7.0	The Root of All Evil	The " Lost Dutchman " Gold Mine has entered American folklore as one of those unattainable , and menacing , treasures . Supposedly Jacob Walz found it in the Superstition Mountains of Arizona , and died without ever revealing fully it's location . At least a dozen people have died violently searching for it . Therefore this film easily adds to the story of greed and blood that covers the wealth of that forgotten mine . I liked the negative performances of the leads ( Ford , Lupino , and Young ) , none of whom are likable or redeemable . It was very unusual to see them in such characterizations ( although Lupino had played some villainous types , like " Betsy Broke " in " The Light That Failed " ) . Young was still a few years from his first decent role , the weak drunkard in " Come Fill The Cup " . Ford usually played good guys , although he did play the politically ambitious Civil War madman in " The Man From Colorado " in this period . But here they all cut their teeth quite well in the film as low lives . The interesting thing is that they are not the only villains - greed also percolates in the modern part of the movie , where the hero ( William Prince ) discovers the most unlikely , deadly villain facing him at the end . Altogether a worthwhile film .
493435	3280905	871426	7.0	Superior nice girl - buddy film	The summer of 2008 is going to be recalled for the nomination of the first African American candidate for the Presidency with a serious chance of winning that office on a major party ticket ( and , as we know , he did win ) . It is also going to be recalled for one of the most questionable choices in American political history : the decision by Republican front-runner John McCain to choose Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential running mate . I am a Democrat , but I tend to be moderate to Conservative in my views . Governor Palin ( I thought ) turned out to be a brave , determined lady in her campaigning . But ( and this is not her fault ) she was not ready for the limelight of a national campaign . She may ( in time ) develop into a better candidate for such office by 2012 or 2016 , but she needs polishing and preparation . Instead , she came across as brave and determined , but also woefully unprepared for more than occasionally sharp sound-bites against the Democrats . Still let us give her credit . She was the second woman to be nominated for the Vice Presidency on a major Party ticket ( the first being , of course , Geraldine Ferraro ) , but I suspect in historical memory Palin is going to be better recalled than her predecessor . Not to knock Ferraro ( who had her own chain of misfortune in the years after 1984 ) , but Palin became a public subject of discussion and fun for her interest in hunting , her residence in the largest state , her being a " soccer mom " , her daughter's pregnancy , and her occasional errors regarding responses to the press . One thing that made Palin so interesting was due to a gifted actress and comedy writer Tina Fay . Appearing on Saturday Night Live , Fay ( who resembles Palin ) pretended to be the Governor week after week , making funny comic blunders that mirrored public conceptions and misconceptions of Palin ( such as " And I see Russia from my house ! " ) . Fay , up to last summer , was a rising figure but not on the real celebrity radar yet . Palin ( prior to McCain's blunder in choosing her to attract dissatisfied female voters angry at Hillary losing the Democratic nomination ) was a successful local governor of a huge state with a small population . There unintentional mutual attraction pushed them into headier careers . Palin will be a contender again . . . trust me . Fay will have more roles and writing chances than she had before . . . trust me . Mutuality of goals and careers - it is a good point to really begin a discussion of BABY MAMA , a sweet film that Fay made last year with Amy Poehler . Fay is a successful career woman in a corporation that is headed by " Green Earth " guru Steve Martin . Martin is a clever businessman , but he is loopy about keeping in touch with his karma , and the earth's spirits , and nature . Fay , one of his chief Vice Presidents , is behind his plans for building the largest store of earth based products in the world in Philadelphia . She is highly competent , and this includes being able to handle her boss's strange notions . When he finds a tiny sea shell he shows it to Fay and his architect and says he wants the department store to be based on that shell . He's talking about the shell's spiritual perfection and design , which Fay understands . But the architect asks if he wants the store designed to look like the shell . The soft spoken Martin glares at the architect , and still speaking quietly tells him that at this moment he'd like to kill him . Fay's life is not complete . She wants children , but physically cannot have them due to the shape of her uterus . She cannot adopt either as a single , active woman . But she finds a institute run by Sigourney Weaver that promises the use of a surrogate mother to give birth to the babe . It costs $100 , 000 . 00 , but it may work . Fay meets Poehler who is sent to her by Weaver . Poehler is " white urban trash " with a boyfriend ( Dax Sheppard ) who has " great ideas " that never work ( in fact he never works either ) . But Fay is taken by Poehler , and chooses her for the surrogate . The film follows the road the two women take together in trying to keep an eye on their joint mission of having the baby , but also trying to understand ( and even like ) each other . Poelher is into junk food , heavy metal , and fun . Fay is into healthy food , quieter music , and care for that embryo inside Poehler . They grate on each other's nerves , and explosions constantly happen ( usually observed by Fay's building's doorman , Romany Malko ) . But Fay slowly gets to see there is a very intelligent woman inside Poelher , and Poehler starts noticing that Fay has achieved what she dreams of for herself . Inevitably the two woman begin liking each other . Poehler's romance hits some rocks ( Sheppard fools around ) , while Fay finally meets a reasonably decent guy ( Greg Kinnear ) . There is also pressures on Fay from her mother ( that great mother from Hell , Holland Taylor ) and in her own sister's ( Maura Tierney's ) success in rearing four or five kids of her own . How the two women finally arrive at a satisfactory conclusion I won't describe , but suffice to say the movie does end with nobody ( except maybe Sheppard ) really unsettled by events . On the whole it is a good female buddy film comedy .
493026	3280905	62490	7.0	Funny and a lesson about the value of paper money	This film and " The Busy Body " are the two forgotten comic gems of the 1960s in that genre of films where all the prominent comedians appeared together . We recall " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " , " The Russians Are Coming , The Russians Are Coming ? " , " Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines " , " Monte Carlo , or Bust ? " , and " The Wrong Box " . But these two films not recalled , probably because the settings are not as colorful as the other films . Several of them are period pictures , one is set on Nantucket Island , and one is a type of cross-country chase based on greed . Greed plays a part in " Who's Minding the Mint ? " and " The Busy Body " , but the settings ( while unusual in both films - here with a government building at night , and a sewer transversed by row boats , the other one dealing with a barbecue on a skyscraper's terrace and a corpse set up on a bench with a woman trying to vamp it ) are not quite as colorful . I like both movies , and this one is funny for reasons starting with it's cast and going through the routines and shticks they throw up . Victor Buono normally played villains or neurotics in films ( even in comedies like " Four For Texas " , but also " Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? , where he wasn't the actual villain ) . Here he is a sea captain , who has dreamed of building a great sailing boat . Unfortunately he captains the little boats on a kiddie ride in the park . Milton Berle is a successful pawn shop owner , who lets his greed get the better of him - and neatly expands the complications of plotting in the film . Bob Denver , nominally an ice cream truck driver , turns into a sex idol . Jack Gilford is a great safe cracker , but he has gone deaf in prison ( don't ask ) , and now needs a good hearing aide to hear the tumblers fall into place . So it goes on and on . Even Joey Bishop finally had a decent comic turn here as a man with a serious gambling problem . The Rat Pack films never served him as well . Jim Hutton and Dorothy Provine make a nice , appealing couple , with Walter Brennan as a type of fairy " godfather " to them . But there is a cute lesson about the true value of paper money . Supposedly the level of paper currency is watched to prevent inflation like that type which Weimer Germany had in 1922-23 . But the plot involves reprinting much paper money to cover an error , and then some . As this would be included in the official records of the printing plant , it would be subsumed into the normal level of money printed each year . Nobody would ever notice the additional greenbacks that have been printed illegally . So if the record conforms perfectly , there is no actual counterfeiting . So much for the value of paper money . . . at least in this movie's point of view .
492892	3280905	37610	7.0	Spain's Agony , and Britain's Indifference to Danger	It could have been a better film . It does drag at points , and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix's death , but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil . His stories are all morality tales , due to his own considerations of Catholicism , guilt and innocence ( very relative terms in his world view ) , and the human condition . Boyer is Luis Denard , a well-known concert pianist , who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War . He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed . Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain . In particular Katina Paxinou ( Mrs . Melendez ) a grim boarding house keeper , and Peter Lorre ( Mr . Contreras ) a teacher of an " esperanto " type international language . Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl ( Else ) who works for Mrs . Melendez . The local diplomat , Licata ( Victor Francken ) is already a willing associate of the Falangists . The Brits ( Holmes Herbert , Miles Mander , and best - if not worst - of the lot , George Coulouris ) don't give much hope to Boyer's cause ( which he soon grasps may be Britain's before long ) . Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald's and Stanley Baldwin's governments during the Civil War . Coulouris here is a typical Col . Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction , he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general . The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall ( Rose Cullen ) , here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really . She's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord . It was Bacall's second film , and ( sad to say ) almost sank her long career . She does act well , but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks . Boyer is a fine actor , but he's not Bogie , and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks . Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again , and her star resumed it's ascendancy . It's a bleak film ( as was the novel ) . Boyer's mission never succeeds , as he has too many hidden foes all over the place . But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives . With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou ( and the man who destroys her ) . It is well worth watching to catch the Warner's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction .
492567	3280905	71870	7.0	One version on video that I saw live on stage .	MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is considered by Shakespearean Scholars to be one of three plays call the " Joyous Comedies " . The other two are AS YOU LIKE IT and TWELFTH NIGHT , and the subject of them is either joy of living or love . They are considered a high point in Shakespeare's development as an artist on par with his dramatic height in his tragedies of the same period ( HAMLET , MACBETH , OTHELLO , KING LEAR ) . And yet , while college courses spend time teaching TWELFTH NIGHT and MUCH ADO and AS YOU LIKE IT to the public , most people who like theater think that Shakespeare's best comedy was the earlier A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM . TWELFTH NIGHT is revived more frequently than the other two joyous comedies , but A COMEDY OF ERRORS or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW ( politically incorrect as the latter is now ) are more popular . The problem with MUCH ADO is that it's great wit is hidden by the style of Shakespeare's writing . He was always mixing styles of humor , from low types like Bottom to the height of witty conceits . The early Shakespeare , like his contemporaries , was impressed by John Lily's EUPHUES , an early comedy of puns and word plays . Shakespeare , of course , could knock this off quickly - but the problem of dealing with this is that ( except for those lines based on sexual punning ) most of his references are so obscure that one needs some type of guide to explain them . This is particularly the case when dealing with Beatrice and Benedict and their wit duels . Most audiences these days can't follow them too well . So the presentation of the amusement has to beef up that portion . This particular production was produced by Joseph Papp in 1973 , and I was lucky enough to see it when my college offered it as a free trip to the city . As I had a Shakespeare course at the time , it fit in well . The cast was made up of New York theater and television figures . Today , the actor playing Benedict ( Sam Waterston ) is the best known ( as is F . Murray Abraham , here in a minor part ) , because Waterston is A . D . A . McCoy on LAW AND ORDER , and Abraham is an Oscar winner and a star of Broadway productions ( ironically in another Shakespeare " comedy " right now : THE MERCHANT OF VENICE ) . But in 1973 the soap opera performers Douglass Watson and Kathleen Widdowes ( as Don Pedro and Beatrice ) were better known to local audiences , and Bernard Hughes ( as Constable Dogberry ) was developing a prominence in television and the movies ( his best known film role was as the deadly avenging patient in Patty Chayevski's THE HOSPITAL ( 1971 ) ) . The production made sure that the story ( originally in an Italian principality in the Rennaisance ) was reset in the U . S . during the aftermath of the Spanish American War . The production had it's rewards . Little bits of business stick to the mind - like Widdowes and her girlfriends stealing puffs from a regular tobacco cigarette in 1900 ( something unheard of among good young ladies - but Beatrice , after all , is somewhat daring . Waterston , going canoing and paddling backward ( the canoe was on a turntable on stage ) , getting out , and then hiding behind the upright canoe , as though it is leaning against a tree ( and it is not fooling the other actors on stage ) . But best in the production was Hughes as the impossibly dense policeman , who has a " Keystone Kop " force to assist him in seeking out the criminals . Up to his last line , when he announces he has captured the ringleader and has put his hands in a pair of MONACLES ( not manacles ) Hughes acted like he was Ford Sterling returned to life . Note should also be taken of the late Jerry Mayer as the bad natured Don Juan , who when thwarted in one evil plot at the start gave one of the funniest hissy fits on record . Most of these items were in the film version as they were on the stage . The production was a good one , though nothing remarkable . I would recommend seeing the video of the production , to enable one to see a good cast at work in an interesting concept for the production . But if one wants to understand the verbal jousting of the two lovers , read the play and follow the glossary of terms that are included .
491772	3280905	508127	7.0	Hitch's salute to Crowsborough	In his career as a film director Alfred Hitchcock frequently turned to real life crime for his stories . The Crippen Case is suggested in REAR WINDOW , in the murder of Mrs . Thorwall by her husband , who claims his wife has gone on a trip . In the first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH he brings up the 1910 Siege of Sidney Street . In doing Joseph Conrad's THE SECRET AGENT as SABOTAGE Hitch is looking at the attempt ( in 1894 ) of an anarchist to blow up the Greenwich Observatory . The same thing in this 1959 episode of Hitch's television series . It is a look at a crime ( or presumed crime ) of 1926 , which is still a matter of debate to this day . Lawrence Harvey was at the point in his career where his reputation was on the rise . In 1959 he made his best remembered film , ROOM AT THE TOP . He had made a version of ROMEO AND JULIET a few years earlier . The following year he would be sharing big billing with John Wayne and Richard Widmarck in THE ALAMO . But this was the only production directed by Alfred Hitchcock he ever appeared in . SPOILER WARNING : Harvey is a farmer named Arthur , who is romancing Hazel Court . But Court's interests in him are slowly turning him off . She suspects he has met another woman , and goes to confront him . There is an argument , in the course of which Court is killed . Harvey has done this in a relatively isolated space , and considers his options . At the end of the episode , he is being visited by the police ( Robert Douglas and Patrick Macnee ) and they can find nothing to really bring up suspicions against him . They leave , and we see Harvey feeding his chickens . We now realize what has happened to the remains of Court . It is a clever , ghoulish ending - typical of Hitchcock's warped sense of humor ( and a type of variant to his most famous television directing stint : LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER ) . It was all suggested by the Norman Thorne - Elsie Cameron tragedy at Crowsborough , in Sussex England , in 1926 . Thorne , a chicken farmer , had a relationship with Cameron , but it was souring . She said she was going to see him to settle this , claiming that she was pregnant . She left for their meeting at his home , but nothing further was heard of her . Thorne actually sent her telegrams demanding to know why she had not come . The police visited Thorne , but he was plausible about not having any idea of what happened to Elsie . Then a local photographer took his picture on the farm , and he posed over a spot near the chicken coop . Thorne might have gotten away with it , but for the return to Crowsborough of a neighbor . She had not been reading the newspapers much , but now she caught with the story . She went to the police and said she saw Elsie headed for Thorne's farm on the day she was last seen alive . Thorne was revisited by the police , who made a more thorough search . Someone recalled the posing for the picture , and found the spot . In digging they found the cut up remains of Elsie's body . Thorne explained there had been an argument , and he left the shack he lived in while Elsie threatened suicide . When he returned he found her hanging . Thorne panicked and cut up the body to hide it . He stuck to this suicide story through the entire trial . The prosecution put the matter into the capable hands of Bernard Spilsbury . The forensic expert studied the remains and came to the conclusion that the body showed signs of shock , normally found in people who are hanged by other people - and not prepared for such a conclusion . But the defense put together ten experts , one of whom ( Dr . Robert Bronte of Ireland ) produced slides . These suggested certain markings on the neck that were more in line to a suicide theory . Spilsbury ( who had a low view on Bronte's abilities ) said that the slides were improperly made , and they showed a staining agent at work , not so-called markings . Thorne's previous lies and his posing over the remains and Spilsbury's reputation convicted the chicken farmer . He was hanged later in 1926 . But the matter of his real guilt or innocence remains . Hitchcock allows Arthur to momentarily hide the traces of his victim's death - far more effectively than Thorne ever did . The episode is a nice example of Hitchcock's efficiency in handling dramatic material well , even in a short running time .
492168	3280905	74588	7.0	Robert Culp and the Perils of Prosperity	It's not a great comedy , but THE GREAT SCOUT AND CATHOUSE THURSDAY is a spoof western that plays around with such themes as settling long standing scores and recapturing a lost love from youth . In the proper hands mighty great tragedies of loss of innocence or happiness have been built on such themes like THE SEARCHERS . Here it is sent up - with a heavenly nuttiness . Lee Marvin , Strother Martin , and Oliver Reed ( as a truly vengeful Native American - more below ) all worked a gold site with Robert Culp when they were all younger and ( these three ) more innocent . Culp ran off with the money , and used it to become a powerful gold mine owner . Marvin accidentally tracks him down , and gathers the other two to confront him and demand their share . And he laughs in their face , and uses his goon squad to chase them away . But they come up with a plan to kidnap Culp's wife ( Elizabeth Ashley ) to force him to give them their money . Marvin , now an old saddle bum , recalls how Ashley and he were once quite hot for each other . He figures that there should be little real problem . A touch of O'Henry comes here - " The Ransom of Red Chief " . It seems that marriage and prosperity brought out the worst in both Culp and Ashley . Both are used to their comforts , and neither are particularly nice people , nor do they care for each other ( Culp has been promoting a prize fighter for the heavyweight championship - the gentleman has been sleeping with Ashley ! ) . So after having the " pleasure " of kidnapping Ashley , Marvin discovers Culp couldn't care less . The film has some wonderful touches in it . Reed's " Joe Knox " is the most interesting vengeful Indian in American movies . Forget slow torments over roasting fires , or flaying alive , or " running the gauntlet " or scalping . Seems Joe has venereal disease , and plans to spread it all over the west . Martin , when he learns this , is frightened ( " Damn it Joe , we drank out of the same cup ! " , he squeals ) . Reed foresees that his one-man assault on the U . S will reach the White House ( he sees Teddy Roosevelt screaming about it ) . Lee Marvin does convince him to see a doctor , but Reed is aware ( apparently ) of the current treatment with mercury and a needle . Marvin tries to reassure him ( " It's all done with a little pill now ! " ) . Reed believes him , until he sees the doctor , and runs out . Culp and his relationship with Marvin is also interesting . When they were younger and working together , Culp was a member of the Democratic Party like Marvin ( and Martin , presumably ) . But now he's a man of property and position . He is not only a good taxpayer and a Republican ( as Brian Keith would have said in THE HALLALUJAH TRAIL ) but he is pushing the election of Republican Candidate William Howard Taft over William Jennings Bryan . Marvin can't believe this apostasy , and Culp is obviously annoyed by Marvin's confronting him on such an important matter . When they finally confront each other in a fight , Culp says he is not only going to beat up Marvin for trying to get his money back , but he's going to force him to vote for the better man for President . Whenever he punches Marvin , Culp says , " You will vote for Taft ! " . Seldom has political principle gone to such a length . It was a good comedy , and is worth watching . It also ( in it's conclusion ) gave Marvin an opportunity to sing in a movie again , as he had done in PAINT YOUR WAGON . But this time the song is livelier , and there are others singing it with him .
491769	3280905	52744	7.0	Shaw , the Medical Profession , and the Limits of Self-Satisfied Criticism	When one talks of Bernard Shaw's best plays , one thinks of those plays he wrote from MRS . WARREN'S PROFESSION ( 1895 ) to ST . JOAN ( 1923 ) , with a nod at THE APPLE CART ( 1930 ) and TOO TRUE TO BE GOOD ( 1932 ) . After 1923 there is a slackening in his creativity - the plays become impossible for one reason or another - in one case a horrifying political time capsule ( GENEVA , his valentine to Hitler , Mussolini , and Stalin ) . But some of the great plays of the early days creak a bit today . MAN AND SUPERMAN , his first five hour play ( with DON JUAN IN HELL as a play within the play ) is not revived too often . The Fabian sayings at the end were dismissed by George Orwell as " crackerjack sayings " in the 1940s . THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA is a similar defective masterpiece today . There is no doubt that the medical profession deserves critical review every decade or so , as Sinclair Lewis and A . J . Cronin demonstrated in the 1920s and 1930s . The fact that doctors can show more interest in making pots of money than in curing the ills of man is constantly in front of us . But Shaw's attack in THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA was something else : the plot involves the age old question of who should live and who should die . Dubedat ( Dirk Bogarde ) is a great painter , with a devoted wife - but he is a scoundrel . He is dying of tuberculosis , and Mrs . Dubedat ( Leslie Caron ) goes to see Sir Colonso Ridgeon ( John Robinson ) to see if he can use his tuberculosis " cure " on her husband . It has gotten good results , and Ridgeon seems willing to use it , but he slowly gets to dislike Dubedat , and begins wondering if his life is worth saving ( there are alternative patients to try to help ) . SPOILER COMING UP : Certainly Dubedat ( a bigamist and male chauvinist type ) is questionable , if very talented . But as Shaw pursues the matter something else enters the issue that is more personal : Ridgeon finds he is falling in love with Mrs . Dubedat . It is this personal element ( kept hidden until the end ) that raises the play . But now comes the part that ages it . If you read the long ( typically overly long ) introduction that accompanies THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA , Shaw was making a commentary on the recent failure of the British surgeon , Sir Almroth Wright , to find a method of eradicating tuberculosis in the London Metropolitan area ( THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA was published in 1907 ) . Wright was on the cutting edge of scientific study on tuberculosis , like his German contemporary Robert Koch , developer of tuberculin . Wright tried to convince the public authorities to allow him to inoculate hundreds of people with tuberculin injections and the like . He was certain this would get rid of this great " white death " plague . It didn't work - it produced some interesting statistical data ( earning Wright the satiric nickname , " Sir Almost Right " ! ) . But the disease remained as prevalent as ever . Actually it just helped to show the failure of tuberculin as a cure . Shaw the cynical satirist took up this to attack the intellectual pretensions of the medical profession on " curing " disease . If he meant that Wright had jumped to conclusions , Shaw was partly right , but the alternative of just standing around doing nothing when he had the chance seems ridiculous . Shaw goes beyond the tuberculosis issue - he attacks the profession for having " cut-happy " surgeons like Robert Morley or worse , high class quacks like Alistair Sim ( he insists blood poisoning is the cause of most of man's ills , due to everyone having a particular sack in their intestines - one that he is lucky enough not to have , so he's safe ! ) . Only the elderly , wise Felix Aylmer is an acceptable doctor to Shaw - he questions everything with a lifetime of healthy skepticism . It is entertaining , until you realize that Shaw would simply have doctors visit you , examine you , tell you what is wrong , and then leave without doing anything for you ( except if you are dying they'd make you comfortable ) . This is hardly what is expected of doctors in any society - people want to be better . Shaw would say that the life force would cure itself ( he would keep returning to the life force - making it omnipotent in BACK TO METHUSALEH in the 1920s ) . That a life force may need support he'd dismiss . One has to remember , Shaw may have read up on Wright's statistical findings , but he probably barely understood them - he was not a scientist , but a social critic and dramatist . A lifetime vegetarian , it is symbolic of the idiocy of his views on medicine that he spent part of his last years defending having to use a beef-liver extract for his health ( my God ! how could he dare use a doctor's prescription for medicine when he had that life force ! ) from criticism from other vegetarians about his hypocrisy . Apparently he never chose to notice his hypocrisy either .
493312	3280905	507780	7.0	An Explosion ( West of Java ) To Remember ?	I really liked this series , but I had a little trouble with this episode - well acted and with some point that it merits a " 7 " , but which I have never seen any verification about . Supposedly , on the morning of August 25 , 1883 , a newspaper reporter in Boston named Henry Soames , when preparing to go to work , suddenly had a violent fit that threw him down , several times . When he came to , he realized that halfway around the world there was a dreadful catastrophe : the eruption of a volcano that would blow an island in half - an island named " Krackatoa " . But it was in the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) and far away - too far from any telegraph lines . Soames rushes to his paper and prints the story , scooping the entire globe . But the nearest news centers in the far east had not heard anything . Although the newspaper editor ( more about him later ) is at first ecstatic about the scoop , when no confirmation comes out he turns ugly and fires Soames . Soames cannot explain why he had his sudden vision or whatever , but goes home jobless . Then , within 24 hours , Soames is dragged back to the newsroom . The confirmation has come out : Krackatoa erupted on the 26th of August , and killed ( with tsunamis similar to the ones that hit the Indian Ocean last year ) 33 , 000 people . The editor is once again all smiles , as he can be congratulated for scooping the entire western world by 24 hours . But how ? Obviously Soames must have some crazy mental power . So the editor tells Soames he will have a special column , with his own by-line ( a real rarity for newsmen in the 1880s ) , and will predict the future for the readers of the newspaper ! Soames , of course , has had it . He has seen this editor blow hot and cold twice in 24 hours , but this really takes the cake . He tells off the editor before walking out that he is fully aware that people want to know the future to plan for an improved future for themselves . That great tycoons , for instance , would love to know when to buy and sell so they don't lose anything . All his power ( if it is a power ) has shown is that the common human race is a bunch of scared rabbits . As far as Soames is concerned he won't be a tin-pot fortune teller reassuring everyone . There is a coda ( which I have never seen mentioned anywhere else ) that years later one of Soames former fellow workers sees him as a copy editor in a small newspaper on September 7 , 1901 . While observing him , he sees Soames stop in a trance , and write something down , and then leave the office . Then a wire comes over the telegraph . Soames has written " President shot in Buffalo " . The telegram announces that McKinley has been shot in Buffalo . I liked the story because the actor who played Soames ( John Meillon ) gave a good effective reading of the best scene in the drama - where Soames tells off the newspaper editor . Parts of the episode were a trifle slow , but that scene made the show worthwhile . We all wish , at time , we knew the future , but knowing the future only shows us what pitiful creatures we are , dependent on various circumstances for our comfort and survival . And Soames ( who doesn't even understand why he had the vision about an island volcano he never heard of ) has only found it makes him a freak , and it buffets him about concerning his job . The on-again / off-again " friendly editor " was played by British actor John Phillips . You have probably saw Phillips in many parts over the years in movies and television ( usually British television , not American ) . Yet he had a good handling of an " American accent " , and in Peter Ustinov's ROMANOFF AND JULIET ( made about the time of this episode ) , Phillips played the American Ambassador to Concordia . With his sharp , pointed nose , Phillips could look smart and formidable and threatening , so he played many villains in his career . On the original FORSYTHE SAGA he was Sir Alexander MacGown , a Tory M . P . who takes the social conflict between his girlfriend Marjorie Farrar and Fleur Forsythe Mont into the House of Commons , attacking Fleur's husband Michael . Phillips was usually a very good character actor , and he makes the most out of the scenes his newspaper editor has in this episode of ONE STEP BEYOND , who is too blind to see how his own behavior helps put a major crimp into the newspaper's scheme to use Soames " correctly " .
492568	3280905	552307	7.0	An unexpected pleasure - my first " Dad's Army " episode on " You Tube "	I had heard of this series , but I had never seen any episodes . Apparently , although in a different spirit of production , DAD'S ARMY had a popularity in England similar to it's near contemporary M . A . S . H . in the U . S . But the situations in both series are not quite the same . Arthur Lowe's Mainwaring ( for Americans : it is pronounced " Mannering " ) is the head of the local civil defense group of elderly or middle aged or physically incapable misfits who are protecting the home front in the period of World War II . It is not a real picnic , as they are experiencing the Nazi Blitz ( and later the buzz bombs ) but the problems of these local heroes are shown with some care and gentleness . Lowe ( who I best knew from his elderly , left-of-center butler in THE RULING CLASS ) is a bank manager , and is somewhat pompous - but he is actually quite intelligent , frequently seeing the idiocy of assignments he and his forces have to perform . He is abetted by Wilson ( John Le Messurier ) who has a calming effect on everyone , but can be reduced to terror if his wife is mentioned . You Tube had this on in three sections . Mainwaring's men are ordered to assist in a morale boosting film that is being shot : they are to appear as Nazi soldiers . Although this is not what the men would have liked ( they would have liked to be British soldiers ) they get to the idea of being in a film with Cecile Courtleigh . But Mainwaring's feelings take a downturn when he finds he can't be fitted with a pair of boots ( his feet are too small - and they have to be Nazi style uniform boots ) . He still remains to watch the men in their work with the film people . A week later they are to be shooting on an open field set . The men are driven in a truck that is closed ( and the weather is very hot - this is in the days when air conditioning was non-existent ) . Mainwaring is the only one who is dressed as a British soldier , so he is driving . The men learn the shooting has been postponed for a week , and they return to their camp . But Mainwaring has to call his superior to explain what happened . He parks the car in front of a local pub , and while on the pay phone the men go into the pub for something to drink . Naturally soon rumors circulate that England has been invaded , and that the Nazis are led by a Quistling British army Captain . The truck reaches the headquarters of Mainwaring's Unit - a church . Word has just reached the locals about the Nazis led by the Quistling . They see Mainwaring addressing the Nazi troops , and run to the Church's bells to start giving a signal to call the locals together for defense . This is the " Ring Dem Bells " of the title . The storyline is obvious - once the men are in those uniforms and we hear they are not to reveal their moonlighting as actors playing Nazis to anyone , we know the misunderstanding will occur . No great surprise there . But what is fun is the interactions of the characters . John Laurie's Scotsman ( Frazer ) complains about how hot the uniform are to wear ( and stiff too ) . When he asks someone about whether he agrees about his complaints about the German helmet , he's told it does make his fierce eyed face look like an eagle ( hardly a negative comment ) . Another member tells how in an earlier war ( one does not know if the earlier war is World War I or the Boer War ) Lord Kitchener hated German helmets , thinking they looked like pots to boil food in . And then there are the two members of the unit who are to play Nazi officers ( Le Messurier and Ian Lavender as his nephew Pike ) . Le Messurier does note the Nazi uniforms do look smart , but Lavender lets his role go to his head - he starts staring out of his monocle , and he insists on not standing with the enlisted men when Mainwaring calls the men to order ( Mainwaring quickly puts that back to normal ) . Later , when the truck is driving along a deserted road , Pike is standing through a vent in the top , " heiling " imaginary crowds ! It was a good episode to catch to get into knowing this series . Hopefully more will be available soon .
493114	3280905	748589	7.0	When Agnes finally won one	Agnes Moorehead was a pretty terrific actress , and could actually play all types of roles : Charles Foster Kane's self-sacrificing mother , the love-sick and jealous old maid in THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSOMS , the put upon Countess Fosco who finally turns on Sidney Greenstreet in THE WOMAN IN WIFE , the hypocritical socialite who is not very patriotic in SINCE YOU WENT AWAY , JANE EYRE's evil but finally broken aunt . . . Moorehead was talented enough to breath life into all her roles . She was as convincing as the nurse and friend of Jane Wyman in MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , as she was convincing in the sophisticated and malevolent witch and mother-in-law Endora in television's BEWITCHED . Yet for all of her performance excellence Moorehead failed to achieve major recognition from any of the performing awards . She was up for Oscars on four occasions ( as late as HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE ) and failed to get one . This lack of recognition ended in 1967 , when she got an Emmy Award . She was nominated in two categories that year . One was for best actress in a supporting role in a comedy ( as Endora ) . It was one of four nominations for that role she would get - and she never won any for her best remembered television part . But she was also nominated for the role of Emma Valentine , Grant Administration hostess , matchmaker , and murder conspiracy organizer - in this episode of THE WILD WILD WEST . And finally she got the award she deserved . It's doubtful that people ( outside of fans of Robert Conrad's series ) recall the performance . Jim West and Artemus Gordon ( Ross Martin ) are sent on a mission involving the deaths of several of the nation's wealthiest men . All have had sudden violent deaths , and their wealth seems to be the only key to their demises . But West and Gordon discover that all have recently married younger women , and the person who arranged the marriages is Moorehead . Having failed to save J . Edward McKinley ( speared to death by his piano when playing it ) , the agents try to rescue shipping tycoon Henry Beckman . And they start looking closer and closer at Moorehead's Emma Valentine . Moorehead ( like most of the villains on the show ) is an egotist with a twisted set of goals ( she's determined to raise the position of American women - in suffragette America - by making herself the richest and most powerful woman in the nation ) . Like other villains ( Michael Dunn's Dr . Miguelito Lovelace comes to mind , as does Victor Buono's Count Mazzini ) , she has one trap after another to preoccupy Conrad and Martin , and they just manage to beat her each time . But she also has a charm and grace ( although she pushes too hard at times ) . She can be deadly when she wishes . I suspect that her winning this Emmy was a type of " booby prize " award for failing to give her the Emmy for Endora so frequently . Moorehead is very good as the villainous Emma , but the episode is hardly that brilliant to merit such recognition for her performance . In fact , it's another performance in the episode that in retrospect is far more memorable ( if not major ) . Emma ( like all good WILD WILD WEST villains ) has minions and roughs working for her . One is a middle aged , thin man , who is constantly laughing his head off ( except when he is knocked down by Conrad ) . This minion ( who is really insanely laughing - not " giggling " as this thread's description of the character suggests ) was played by Mickey Daniels . Daniels was the former child star member of the Hal Roach OUR GANG in the 1920s and early 1930s , and was also in the series ( with Grady Sutton ) of " Boy Friend " comedies as well . After a final minor film part in the late 1940s , Daniels ( who had a drinking problem ) did not have any other acting job until he did this episode of THE WILD WILD WEST . And it would prove to be his last performance . Working normally as a cab driver , he was found dead ( of cirrhosis of the liver ) in his motel rooms in 1971 . So forgotten had he become , it was 20 years or so before scholars found out when he had died .
493050	3280905	38104	7.0	The First Celebrity Super Couple ?	There is a trick about movies concerning great or even good composers . Few of them have lives that ( outside of musicologists or curious people ) are worth talking about . Also , as their music is the reason for their greatness , the music is going to dominate the film - any activity on screen is going to be less interesting ( unless the composer's life is interesting ) than what they created for their audiences and posterity . Which composers have popped up on screen ? Beethoven in several films ( best , possibly , by Gary Oldman in 1994's IMMORTAL BELOVED ) . Chopin in the film about to be discussed here . His pal , Franz Liszt ( Dirk Bogarde ) in SONG WITHOUT END . Johann Brahms and Robert Schuman ( Robert Walker Sr . and Paul Henried ) in SONG OF LOVE . Wagner in the television series of that name ( by Richard Burton ) , and Verdi in the television series of that name ( by Ronald Pickup ) . Douglas Montgomery ( MELODY LANE ) and Don Ameche ( SWANEE RIVER ) both essayed Stephen Foster . Clifton Webb was John Philip Sousa in STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER . Walter Connelly was the title composer in THE GREAT VICTOR HERBERT . Jimmy Cagney ( and Joel Grey ) were George M . Cohan ( in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY and GEORGE M . ) . Robert Alda was George Gershwin in RHAPSODY IN BLUE . Tom Drake and Mickey Rooney were Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart in WORDS AND MUSIC . Robert Morley and Maurice Evans were the title characters in THE STORY OF GILBERT AND SULLIVAN . Richard Chamberlain was Pyotr Ilytsch Tschaikowski in THE MUSIC LOVERS . Fernand Gravet was Johann Strauss Jr . in THE GREAT WALTZ . But few of them were really exciting people . Webb's performance as Sousa was good , but the biographical material of the story was passably interesting ( but no more - the music carried the film ) . Chamberlain's film was more interesting because of Tschaikowski's homosexuality . Cagney's breeziness and the theater background of the story of Cohan made that film a permanently popular one . Foster's tragic failure to succeed as our first professional composer ( and his alcoholism ) did give some grip to his biography , but sappy construction and writing hurt the Ameche film ( especially that profoundly stupid conclusion ) . Chopin was " blessed " in several ways biographically . He was a patriot , and part of the film is devoted to his support for the Poles fighting for their freedom from Russia . He did have a long time affair with George Sands , France's leading female novelist in the 19th Century . And he struggled with increasing ill health due to his tuberculosis . He only lived forty years , and oddly enough his birth and death dates almost correspond to his American contemporary Edgar Allan Poe , who was also plagued by ill health through much of his life . Cornell Wilde had been playing supporting parts up to this film , such as the cowardly inside-man in the heist in HIGH SIERRA . It was here that he finally came into his own as an actor , even getting nominated for an Academy Award for his performance . Merle Oberon had an unusual role . Normally she was a supportive lover ( her Cathy is ultimately deeply in love with Heathcliff , but proud and snobbish when she meets Edgar Linton in WUTHERING HEIGHTS - that was an exception for her ) . Here she is committed to her own literary success , and she does little to understand the musical success at the core of the man who adores her . There is a hint of nymphomania in her - a seeming hard incapacity to love that drives men wild ( not only Chopin , but his predecessor in her bed Alfred de Musset the poet ( George Macready ) ) . In the end she is the villain in the film , breaking the spirit of her Polish lover , and dooming him to early death . How true is this ? Not totally . While two creative spirits like Chopin and Sand could clash they both were deeply attached to each other . In a television series on the career of Sand , starring Rosemary Harris , it turned out that a message from Chopin on his death bed was withheld from Sand by her jealous daughter - a fact she did not learn until many decades later . Paul Muni gave a weak , over the top performance as Chopin's mentor Joseph Elsner in the film . He had done older men for years , and Elsner was a slightly comical one ( look at his scene with Howard Freeman as a music publisher ) . But it is overdone , and one of the weaknesses of the movie . Still it is not too serious a weakness . On the whole it is a good film , for the two leads and some of the supporting cast . But it is not true history .
493403	3280905	27311	7.0	" All The World's A Stage . . . . "	AS YOU LIKE IT is an odd duck among the major plays of Shakespeare that have been filmed . It is one of the three top romantic comedies ( with MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and TWELFTH NIGHT ) that Shakespeare wrote , but none of them have been favorites for film ( not like A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ) . MUCH ADO recently was redone by Kenneth Branagh , but not as well received as his HAMLET and HENRY V . AS YOU LIKE IT was done a few times on television , but not as a film - except for this 1936 version . AS YOU LIKE IT is set in the forest of Arden . Most of the characters are in hiding there or have been exiled there . The local Duke has been overthrown by his brother ( Duke Frederick / Felix Aylmer ) and exiled there . His courtiers followed . Lawrence Olivier is the son of a favorite of the old Duke , so he is not in favor with Aylmer . He is also finding life difficult with his older brother Oliver ( John Laurie ) , who is consumed with jealousy . So Orlando ( Olivier ) flees to save his own life , and is soon at the court in the forest of Arden . The true Duke's daughter , Rosalind ( Elisabeth Bergner ) , has also fled with her cousin Celia ( Sophia Stewart ) , because Aylmer is unhappy at his niece's continuous appearance at the regular court . Rosalind ( in the plot ) pretends to be a young boy , who tries to teach Orlando what real love is . He is full of the courtly love that percolated in European intellectual circles at the time , and Rosalind slowly makes Orlando realize how it is artificial ( listen to her dismiss the idea of dying over a broken heart ) . Slowly she makes Orlando a fit lover - a real lover - for herself in her genuine person . The forest becomes a place where truth keeps emerging out of the trees and bushes . One of the old Duke's closest friends , Jacques , gives the most famous speech of the play , " the seven ages of man " . In it he describes the seven different roles played by men in life , from infancy to old age . Jacques is a melancholic figure , and he is balanced in the plot by Rosalind and Celia's servant , the fool Touchstone , who also demonstrates what makes a real lover in his easy dismissal of his rival William ( Peter Bull , as a rather dumb rustic ) over a shepherdess . Eventually even Oliver / Laurie ends up in the forest ( Laurie is sent there because he is blamed for Duke Frederick's daughter's fleeing with Rosalind ) . A bare recital of the play's plot is not as good as watching it . In truth , even with Bergner's accent , she gives one of the most charming performances in Shakespearean film . The personality that made her the leading actress in Austria and Germany carries well in her English films . Olivier , for an early film , does a good job - his youth aiding the character's education in the plot , and his good looks being shown to advantage . Aylmer , Laurie , Bull , Mackenzie Ward ( Touchstone ) , and Leon Quartermain ( Jacques ) do the most with their parts . One wishes more of the play had been included , but the reduced size is not a big problem for the viewer . As an introduction to reading the play , and seeing a complete production , the 1936 film is pretty good .
492510	3280905	20666	7.0	" Barnacle Bill the Sailor "	An early Betty Boop cartoon , with Betty as the girlfriend of Bimbo ( as Barnacle Bill ) determined to flee his ship to have a tryst with her . Betty was drawn as a dog at this time - cut , sexy body and flapper hairdo - but dog ears . Since Bimbo was a dog too it did not matter , but this does lead to an interesting ( if eventually dull ) joke . The cartoon begins with the crew of the sailing ship that Bill is on taking it into port - and singing a chantey up to the dock . They are looking forward to getting off . By the way , the Fleischers do like to stick it to one of their artistic and commercial rivals : Walt Disney . One of the crewmen is a mouse who looks remarkably like Mickey did in the early " Steamboat Willy " cartoons . The ship captain tells the crew they can't leave the ship , but Bimbo / Barnacle Bill proceeds to do so , and knocks out the Captain when the latter tries to stop him . We see him trace the address of Betty ( not under her famous cartoon name - and at an address close to the docks , suggesting what her profession may be ) . He arrives and rings at her door , and they start doing " Who's that knocking at my door ? " and " Barnacle Bill the Sailor " in a long duet . He finally comes upstairs , and while they are alone on her coach she lowers the blinds . Here is that interesting , but eventually dull joke . Remember that both Betty and Bimbo are dogs . All the others in the building , and in the neighborhood are women who are cats , and who notice that Betty has lowered the curtain - and they proceed to " cattily " comment about Betty's behavior with each other . It took me a moment to notice it , but after awhile I felt the joke was milked for more than it was worth . At the end , love ' em and leave ' em Bill leaves a tearful Betty when he admits he'll never marry ( as she wants ) . And he heads downstairs , right into a confrontation with his captain ( who lives in the same building as Betty does ) . A chase and an odd resolution which is reminiscent of the movie SPLASH ends the cartoon . It is not a great Betty Boop cartoon , although the sexual relationship between Betty and Bimbo is interesting , and the use of lightning bolts in a fight at the end is creative . As said elsewhere on this thread , it is worth seeing once .
491668	3280905	52700	8.0	Orson Welles and Leopold and Loeb	In 1924 Nathan Leopold and his friend / lover Richard Loeb were two wealthy young Chicagoans , from Jewish American families , who were extremely well educated . Both were believers in the theories ( somewhat twisted ) of Friedrich Nietzche regarding the idea of the superman . They believed that supermen could regard certain laws as being only meant for " little people " , not supermen . One thing they felt they could ignore was the criminal code . . . and this included murder . They decided to commit a perfect crime for the thrill of it . They would kidnap and kill a child , demand a large ransom , and leave a trail of clues that would befuddle the police . To do this they did do some things that showed careful planning ( like stealing a typewriter so they could send untraceable letters ) . Finally they kidnapped a cousin of Leopold , Bobby Franks ( age 14 ) , killed him in their car , mutilated the body with acid and knives , and hid him in a deserted park culvert . Unfortunately for these two geniuses , Leopold dropped a pair of eyeglasses at the site where Bobby was deposited . It was the eyeglasses that led the police to Leopold and then Loeb , and the two supermen were fairly fast in caving in and confessing . The criminal historian , Jonathan Goodman , once wrote that if he ever planned to commit a murder and would ask infamous criminals for advice , he would certainly choose Burke and Hare ( the Edinburgh body snatchers , who were not caught until they killed 16 people ) over Leopold and Loeb . They did not hang . Their families hired America's greatest attorney , Clarence Darrow , to defend them . He pleaded guilty for them , but requested a bench trial ( just a judge ) for the sentencing . His theory was that a jury would never be able not to divorce the cruelty of their actions from consideration of their punishment . For Darrow , a lifelong opponent of the death penalty , was unwilling to risk losing two guilty clients to public hatred . He gave a classic discussion of the death penalty , and how it would not do what the public wished - stop further crime as a warning , and bring back ( or closure to the family of ) Bobby Frank . And the Judge did decide to not order the execution of Leopold and Loeb . They were sentenced to life plus ninety nine years ( the sentence was later used as the title of Leopold's autobiography ) . But Richard Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936 ( he made a homosexual advance on a fellow prisoner who slashed him to death - and was not punished for it ) . Leopold was released in 1958 . He married , moved to Puerto Rico where he worked as a nurse , and died in 1971 . COMPULSION is based on a novel by Meyer Levin ( a best seller in the late 1950s ) , that was based on the case , changing the names of Leopold and Loeb to Artie Strauss and Judd Steiner . The film only goes through the crime and the trial , culminating in the performance of Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilkes ( a . k . a . Clarence Darrow ) . Dean Stockwell plays a sympathetic , confused Leopold ( an issue among criminal historians - how really weak was Leopold - was he Loeb's sex slave ? ) and Bradford Dillman as a more aggressive Loeb . Martin Milner plays their college friend ( and Leopold's rival for a girl in the class ) , who also finds the eyeglasses . E . G . Marshall is District Attorney Horn ( and gives a very effective performance as an intelligent adversary of the two criminals as well as Welles ) . Diane Varsi plays the girl both Stockwell and Milner love . For some reason her performance is considered weak - actually while not fascinating it was more than competent . The film does show the crime in it's aftermath ( unlike the other film version of the Leopold-Loeb Case - ROPE - this movie does not the actual murder ) . It shows the increasing nervousness of Leopold , while Loeb keeps his cool ( even " helping " the police investigation by suggesting some possible suspects of pedophile leanings ) . It is ( unlike ROPE ) shot as a period film , in the 1920s , but the film is in black and white - so the period costumes and accessories are not detracting from the action . It is a well done film , but Welles appearance is only in the last half hour , culminating in the speech before the judge and his effective parting shot at Stockwell , who feels there is no God ( " Perhaps it was God who made you drop your eyeglasses . " ) . Welles performance of the speech was so effective that it was recorded on a record and was a best seller that year . And it is beautifully done . But the film misses one point . Darrow did not win the sentence he sought by convincing the Judge of the impracticality of the death sentence . The Judge actually dismissed this argument of Darrow's . But Leopold and Loeb were under 21 . He felt they were too young to be hanged . It has been suggested that COMPULSION and ROPE could be shown together , but it would equally be possible to view COMPULSION with INHERIT THE WIND , to compare the performances of Welles with Spencer Tracy as Darrow / Henry Drummond in the latter film . There is also a peculiar type of movie loop in COMPULSION and INHERIT THE WIND . COMPULSION has a scene where Welles , is in his hotel room , when he sees some Ku Klux Klanners light a cross outside his window . In INHERIT THE WIND Tracy answers his hotel door room to see Gene Kelly ( as H . L . Mencken / E . K . Hornbeck ) wearing a hood and saying " Boo " as a joke . This is a reference to Darrow's agnostic / atheistic reputation , which was disliked by many people in his day . And early in INHERIT THE WIND when Kelly announces that Dick York ( as Bertram Cates - John Scopes ) will be defended by Tracy , one of the townspeople says , " He just got those two child-murderers off the other day . " ) . It is rare for two films to have such mutual references in them , when they are not sequel films .
492517	3280905	39306	8.0	A Sympathetic Viper and his Viperish Wife	A day or so ago I commented on the film ( made only a few years after wards ) that somehow resembles this one : FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG . The basic story is of two ill-matched people who are in a marriage from hell . FOOTSTEPS was about a Victorian gentleman who murders his first wife , only to be blackmailed into marrying his socially ambitious maid , and how he starts conspiring to get rid of her as well . The problem with FOOTSTEPS was a lack of decently spirited direction . It lacked spark and pace , and gets boring . The cast tries , but it does not help enough . Not so with DEAR MURDERER . Unlike FOOTSTEPS ( which was a Hollywood product - so it had to be burdened by larger budgets , and needed vervier directing ) , DEAR MURDERER is typical of the success story of British cinema - how with a concentration on minimal effect their films are sharper than bloated productions like FOOTSTEPS . The plot is also more devious . In FOOTSTEPS Jean Simmons ' ambitions help destroy her and Steward Granger . But one can easily understand where she is coming from , as we tend to sympathize with people trying to pull themselves out of lower classes into upper classes . But this is dented because she is a blackmailer ( though Granger's misdeed deserves such a punishment ) . Here , Eric Portman is married to a perpetual flirt ( Greta Gynt ) who despises him . She has been carrying on with Dennis Price , and Portman decides to kill Price . Yet , even in the process of doing just that , Portman gets to know his victim , and realizes that if he had not been sleeping with his wife Price could have been a good friend of his . So his guilt is increased when he discovers that Gynt and Price had broken up their relationship shortly before the murder . See : the story is still melodramatic , but the characterization is more interesting . So is the difference regarding Gynt's personae , as opposed to her opposite number in FOOTSTEPS . Simmons is socially ambitions , but the audience can accept that . Gynt is sluttish and also unlikeable . She is tired about the marriage to Portman ( who does , misguidedly , love Gynt ) , and eventually wonders how she can end it - quickly . The film speeds to it's conclusion . If one dislikes Portman's Nazi in 49TH PARALLEL ( his best remembered performance ) , his performance here certainly makes up for his totally unsympathetic villainy there . I have no problem recommending this film to the readers of these reviews . And of recommending it over FOOTSTEP IN THE FOG to them as well .
493075	3280905	63415	8.0	Blake and Peter do one together without Insp . Jacques	It is a little uneven , but if you stick to it you end up liking this warm and fuzzy little film , the only Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers comedy without Chief Inspector Jacques Clousseau . Sellers had played an Indian before . In THE MILLIONAIRESS ( 1960 ) he was an Indian doctor working for the poor in London who attracts the world's richest woman ( Sophia Loren ) . That film has it's moments ( when the original George Bernard Shaw play creeps out ) but this improvised film of 1968 is far better . Sellers is an Indian film actor who somehow was signed up to do a lead part in a Hollywood production called SON OF GUNGA DIN . Sellers ' actor is playing this supposed fictional character ( really fictional , as Kipling never wrote about his brave water carrier having a family ) . In the opening fifteen minutes Sellers demonstrates the wisdom of being hired by refusing to die properly ( or is he trying to stretch out his deathbed sequence for the screen ? ) . He is shot ( while badly wounded ) blowing a bugle call to the British troops about to be entrapped by the Indian " rebels " . Instead of falling down dead he keeps beeping his bugle again and again and again until the director tells him to stop it . Later he ruins a shot where he kills an enemy picket by forgetting that the movie is set in 1878 , and Sellers is still wearing his waterproof wristwatch ! Finally ( I think Stan Laurel would have appreciated this ) he ruins the one-chance-only destruction of the fort by explosives simply by tying his shoe on the plunger . Fired after the last ( he asks the director if he can still do television ) , Sellers should be seen no more . But the director and the film producer ( Gavin McLeod - later of MCHALE'S NAVY , THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW , and THE LOVE BOAT ) call the studio President , Mr . Clutterbuck ( J . Edward McKinley ) and tell him about what has just happened to send the film's budget into the stratosphere . McKinley says he'll see the actor never works in the film industry again , and writes the name ( Hrundi V . Bakshi ) on a paper on his desk . Unfortunately , he did not realize it is a list of his guests for a fancy dinner party the next day . So Clutterbuck's secretary sends Bakshi / Sellers ) an invitation ) . What follows is a disaster upon disaster improv . Unlike THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK , Edwards and Sellers approached THE PARTY as an experiment where they were creating escalating disasters at the dinner party that engulf all the guests . The escalating disasters is par and parcel for the work of Edwards ' favorite comedians , Laurel & Hardy , for whom his slapstick comedy THE GREAT RACE ( 1965 ) was dedicated to . Sellers arrives at the party and quickly demonstrates the wisdom of inviting him . His shoe is muddy so he tries to " nonchallantly " clean it off in a pool ( the clean water rapidly turns black ) but the shoe floats away . Later , due to Sellers ' ineptitude the shoe ends up on a tray of canapés being served . Still later , when he hurts his hand Sellers sticks it into a mound of ice on a table , only to find the caterer put beluga caviar within the " mountain " of ice . His real problem is he is a square peg in a round hole . He can't mingle and join the people at the party , many of whom have hostility towards him ( Marge Champion , not dancing in this film , is the stiff wife of a Congressman who just never cottons to Sellers ) . He tries to laugh at jokes , not hearing them completely but laughing anyway , or laughing at anecdotes that aren't funny . In his curiosity he experiments with the pushbuttons of the living room , causing all kinds of odd , disruptive errors to occur . He even ends up feeding " Birdy num nums " to the host's pet parrot . Only one person is actually friendly to him at the start - a western film star , whom Sellers enjoys watching . They get on pretty well , except for one mishap with a toy dart gun ( though Sellers isn't blamed for it ) . Then McLeod shows up with his latest protégé , Michelle Monet ( Claudine Longet ) and a second person turns out to be out-of-place at the party , only a French lady , not an Indian man . In the meantime the problems multiply during dinner , when besides Sellers the host and guests have to deal with a drunken waiter ( Steve Franken - best recalled as Dobie Gillis ' rich rival Chatsworth Osborne Jr . ) . The dinner reduced to a shambles between Sellers and Franken ( including causing a squab to get twisted into a guests wig - don't ask ) , the guests do the best they can . I can't get into all the sequences - that spoils the fun here . One of the best deals with Sellers desperately trying to find a place to pee , and finding the bathrooms in use ( once by Mrs . Champion ) , and finally using one in the master bedroom , that he causes a flood in , and even causes the band drummer to lose his drum ( don't ask ) . However , one sequence actually shows that for all the confusion and destruction he causes , Sellers is actually pretty level headed . He confronts McLeod on the latter's miserable treatment of Longet , and shows up the former as a total creep . One recalls that with the other Edwards-Sellers stumble-bum , Clousseau , he is a walking disaster maker - but he is a first rate detective for all that . As I said , it is a little slow at points , and disjointed at times , but stick to THE PARTY . It is a worthy film for it's star and for it's cast .
493254	3280905	795421	8.0	Entertaining enough and fun , but ultimately forgettable .	Meryl Streep has actually sung in several films . She sang a great spoof of opening musical numbers in DEATH BECOMES HER , and also sang a country western tune in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE at the end of that film . She has a good voice and can carry a tune . But this film is the first one where she is center stage in a musical , and carrying several show tunes . Again she does well enough singing them . MAMMA MIA has been on Broadway for several years , and it is an infectious musical , even if only the tune " Dancing Queen " has managed to get any permanent notice . The story line is slightly like that of the film BUONO SERA MRS . CAMPBELL . Donna Sheridan ( Streep ) runs a hotel on a small Greek island . Her daughter Sophie ( Amanda Seyfried ) is about to marry Sky ( Domenick Cooper ) , and there is a large scale wedding being planned ( although Sophie and Sky wanted to elope ) . Sophie has discovered her mother's diary and finds that in the year that she was born her mother had very close affairs with three men : Sam Carmichael ( Pierce Brosnan ) , Harry Bright ( Colin Firth ) , and Bill Anderson ( Stellan Skarsgard ) , one of whom was her biological father . Confiding in her two closest friends Sophie has secretly contacted all three men and invited them back to the hotel . At the same time Donna has invited her two oldest friends the much married Tanya ( Christine Baransky ) and the well known cooking expert Rosie ( Julie Walters ) to help her get through the wedding weekend . The story follows how Donna discovers the three loves of her past ( especially Sam ) are back , and she is upset that Sophie will want to know which one is her father ( a question that Donna is unable to answer ) . The three men are interested in why they were called back , Sam being a divorced man with children , Harry a successful businessman in London , and Bill an independent type who lives most of his life on board a ship . Each slowly realizes what Sopnie is doing , but each concludes that he must be the father - something Sophie ( for some reason , presumably over-enthusiasm ) never carefully thought out . Donna enlists her two friends to assist her in keeping the three ex-boyfriends away from her , which they try to do . As it turns out she is most glad to see Sam again , but is uncertain that the relationship is still revive-able . The film is one that keeps the viewers involved , and is fun . It's unusual to see an actor like Brosnan singing and dancing ( passably ) , and apparently enjoying the experience . Baransky has a nice number thrown in when she reveals her sexual control over a bartender and would-be lover ( a number her alter-ego , " Mary Ann " would have enjoyed on " Cybel " ) . And it does end with a satisfactory conclusion . But it's pleasant but not a great film . It is worthwhile for entertainment value only - not thought provoking . But then , it was meant for entertainment value when it was put on Broadway , and when it was produced as a film .
492108	3280905	46072	8.0	A Peculiarly Hard Bank Note to Spend	This is an amusing trifle , set at the turn of the century in England , but based on a story by Mark Twain of all people . Twain at his best could take a trifling idea and run off with it . He demolishes detectives in " The Stolen White Elephant " , which describes the ineptitude of detectives in finding a huge creature that has run off . Similarly here he demonstrates the limitations of money and how easy one can live on credit by simply having a note that nobody can cash . Two brothers who are very wealthy give the Bank of England one million pounds so that they can settle a bet . There is a single bank note for one million pounds in existence . What would happen if someone in need were given the note as an act of charity ? An American sailor is shipwrecked , and brought to England when rescued without any money on him . He is given the note . Like the two wealthy brothers in " Trading Places " they have a bet : will the sailor survive or starve to death because nobody can cash the note ? Less we think that such notes don't exist , the Federal Reserve System used to use a limited set of $100 , 000 bills with the face of Woodrow Wilson ( the President who signed the Federal Reserve Act into law ) for transfers between the branches of the Federal Reserve Banks . I do not know if they are still in use . There were also notes for $10 , 000 ( with the face of Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury , Salmon P . Chase - who okay-ed the first national " greenback " currency ) , and for $5 , 000 ( with the face of President James Madison , who refused to save the first Bank of the United States , but did push the recharter of the second Bank of the United States - a semi-private early version of the Federal Reserve System ) . The film follows Gregory Peck's discovery that he is a guinea pig for this bet , but making the most of it . The two brothers ( Ronald Squiers and Wilfred Hyde-White ) stay mostly in the background . Both give good performances , and while I agree with another writer on this website that Hyde-White is better remembered today , Squiers was a widely respected film and stage actor of the time ( " The Rocking Horse Winner " , for example ) . Jane Griffiths plays the aristocrat who falls in love with Peck . A . E . Matthews has a nice role as a Yankee hating aristocrat , who suddenly realizes that there is one thing worse that that - a greedy Briton . And Hugh Griffith does the most with the part of a suspicious newspaperman . Twain was fascinated by a legal case of the 1870s , the Ticheborne Claimant , wherein an impostor claimed title to a baronetcy and it's multi-million pound estate . Twain even wrote a novel , " The American Claimant " , based on the incident . One of the noteworthy incidents of the actual case was that " Ticheborne Bonds " were sold promising profit to investors who would give money needed for the Claimant's legal fees ( if he won , they'd be paid out of the estate ) . Similarly here , in the film , bonds supporting Peck's honesty are printed . At one point there is a run by the bond holders when they believe that they've been lied to . It is a very amusing trifle , and well worth catching whenever it appears on television .
492878	3280905	89767	8.0	Clint Mixes Western and Allegory	In talking about COMES A HORSEMAN I discussed a curious switch in the stereotypes of the characters there - that Jason Robards was not the all powerful land baron that appears in say SHANE . Oddly enough the same thing happens with Richard Dysart in this film , but while COMES A HORSEMAN is set in the late 1940s , PALE RIDER is set in the late 19th Century . Dysart is seen at the start of the film returning from a business trip to the state capital . He is leaving the train , and his face is tired and somewhat discouraged looking . The big honcho of the local area he is approached by the sheriff and his deputies about the news he has to bring . And here it veers closer to Robards ' in COMES A HORSEMAN , and further away from . . . say Forrest Tucker visiting the territorial governor in CHISUM . Dysart says that due to changes ( more middle class voters in the state than formerly ) his clout is not as big as it was a decade or so before - especially because of the local farmers and the rival mining interests . And he does not know if he can reverse the trend . Like Robards the big 20th Century rancher in COMES A HORSEMAN , Dysart is finding that he is on a potential slippery slope to bankruptcy . It is an interesting aspect of the westerns we were raised on . So many fortunes were torn out of the American west - frequently by less than honest means , that it is not usually recognized that many of these fortunes did not last . For every Leland Stamford or James J . Hill or Harriman ( the railroad tycoon we never see in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID ) , there were others like Haw Tabor ( the basis for Edward G . Robinson's millionaire in SILVER DOLLAR ) who lost it all in the end . It is not the only odd thing about PALE RIDER . Clint Eastwood took elements from the film SHANE , and combined them with a type of dark-viewed religious allegory . His character , " Preacher " has some ancient history with the sheriff and his deputies and Dysart - they talk of some threat in the past that they took care of , and there is evidence that Preacher was once seriously wounded ( maybe left for dead ) . Yet the silent , relentless Preacher almost seems more than an avenger - like an angel of vengeance from the Lord , perhaps . The weakness ( I feel ) in the movie is Michael Moriarty . He tries hard , but does not seem as forceful a father and husband as Van Heflin was in Shane . But perhaps that is just as well . One final interesting point in the film : Richard Kiel . Best known as the oddly likable villain " Jaws " ( in the later Bond films with Roger Moore ) , Kiel plays " Club " who is one of the workers / goons used by Dysart to do his dirty work . But he is also supposed to keep order in Dysart's business . When Chris Penn ( Dysart's son " Josh " ) and some of the others start molesting a woman , Kiel actually runs over to try to prevent it . He is preempted by the arrival of Eastwood , who thrashes Penn and his buddy . Interestingly enough , Kiel enjoys seeing the would-be rapists punished .
491663	3280905	266391	8.0	Historic truth ? , . . or Orson Welles ' posthumous revenge ?	When Pauline Kael did her celebrated combination of original research and character assassination , entitled " Raising Kane " , she mentioned that in the course of the final version of CITIZEN KANE that we have Orson Welles pruned out some events put into the script by Herman Mankiewicz . Mankiewicz , for example , wanted to make the eventual collapse of the first Kane marriage to Emily Norton Monroe to be caused by Kane's accidental encouragement of the assassination of Emily's uncle , the President of the United States . This was based on an incident that Hearst's enemies seized on involving Ambrose Bierce ( a Hearst columnist in 1900-1901 ) writing a quatrain about the killing ( in 1900 ) of Governor-elect William Goebel of Kentucky , that suggested that the missing assassination bullet was headed for Washington " to stretch McKinley on his bier . " When Leon Czolgosz shot and killed the President in September 1901 Hearst's foes recalled the lines and said Hearst encouraged political murder . The original script for Kane had Emily accusing Charles for her uncle's death , and never forgiving him . That was cut , with Emily's growing dislike for Charles based , instead on his ego , his concentration on his newspaper empire and political ambitions , and his neglect of her ( and probably their son ) . The business with Susan Alexander is the final straw . It was not the only cut of a sensational nature . In the final film Susan tells the reporter that he should speak to Raymond the butler because " ( h ) e knows where all the bodies are . " In the original script Raymond was ( with Susan ) a witness to Kane actually killing a man , but covering it up . This is why Raymond remains so important to Kane in his later years . It also helps explain Susan's growing dislike for her husband . It too was cut . Welles was wise here - everyone in Hollywood would have known what that was about , and any denials about Kane not being based on Hearst would have been dismissed because the dead man would have been too much of a coincidence to ignore . In 1941 it was generally suspected throughout Hollywood ( and in much of the U . S . ) that William Randolph Hearst was in some way responsible for the death ( in 1924 ) of movie director / producer / pioneer Thomas Ince . Ince had been one of a set of guests invited on Hearst's luxury yacht , the " Onieda " for a cruise . Others on the cruise included novelist Elinior Glyn , Hearst's mistress Marion Davies , the great Charlie Chaplin , Tom Ince , and a newcomer to the Hearst empire , gossip writer Louella Parsons . At some point on the trip ( which was supposed to be a two week cruise ) Ince was rushed ashore in serious condition and taken to a hospital . He died two days later . The cause was varied according to the bulletins , usually being either a heart attack or a stomach ailment . However , rumors soon emerged that an incident happened on board the Oneida that led to the shooting of Ince , probably at the hands of Hearst . The story has never completely died , and even today there is a small body of evidence that Ince did not die a natural death . The basic scenario was that Ince was on deck when Hearst was chasing Chaplin ( who had been fooling around with Davies ) and in shooting at Chaplin Hearst accidentally wounded Ince . Hearst was powerful enough to clamp down on the tragedy , but at the same time there was a cost : Louella Parsons was just a new employee at the time . Now , she blackmailed her boss into making her a national columnist and a real power in Hollywood . Peter Bogdanovitch ( who directed THE CAT'S MEOW ) was a close friend of Orson Welles . One can't quite get it out of one's head that this film , a twisted " prequill " to KANE , was meant as Bogdanovitch's homage to the classic film and his attempt to smear Hearst , who after 1941 did everything he could to hurt Welles . The period detail is very good , and Edward Herrmann makes a dandy Hearst ( sort of a return to the mad playboy husband of Goldie Hawn in OVERBOARD , which also takes place on a yacht ) . Certainly he is supremely confident as the millionaire , but he is also smart . A running story line is that Tom Ince ( Cary Elwys ) is trying to get Hearst's backing for a rejuvenation of Ince's film career ( supposedly on the verge of collapse in 1924 ) but that Hearst is not stupid enough to waste his money that way . However , Herrmann does also demonstrate that he is more than a little possessive about Ms Davies ( Kirsten Dunst ) , and that he is worried about that little cockney Chaplin ( Eddie Izzard ) going after his woman . Certainly Chaplin's reputation with the ladies was enough to give any man pause . Jennifer Tilly ( Louella Parsons ) certainly is keeping her eyes open ( she is , after all , a gossip writer ) , and it pays dividends at the end . As for Joanne Lumley as Elinor Glyn , she gives the film a kind of narrative and framework ( Glyn , by the way , if you can't recall her was the woman who termed the euphemism for sex appeal as " it " , and was to make a screenplay called " It " that starred Clara Bow , who became the " It girl " - otherwise she has become pretty forgotten ) . The film is worth watching - not perhaps another PAPER MOON or LAST PICTURE SHOW , but better than AT LONG LAST LOVE . Do I think Hearst killed Ince ? If he did it was a sheer accident , because who would kill a well known figure under such circumstances as part of a comprehensive murder plan !
492538	3280905	85107	8.0	The Great Composer as Anti - Hero	I will admit that this miniseries was almost too much - but the subject was such an incredible one that the viewer who gave it a chance really got to appreciate the production . My only regret is that I saw the abbreviated version - not the nine hour version . Also , to keep in mind , this was the last role in the career of Richard Burton , and as such it was certainly large enough to be a fitting monument to his own career . Richard Wagner was that rarity : a great composer who became a serious multi-cultural figure in his own lifetime . That was because , unlike any of his rivals in the field of opera composition ( including his only real rival , Giuseppi Verdi ) Wagner did more than write music . He wrote the librettos of his operas . You can say they were the closest to fully " organic " works of music by any opera composer of the 19th Century . Besides that , Wagner was ( at least up to 1848 ) a political revolutionary , getting involved in revolutionary activities in Munich ( then the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria ) and Vienna ( then the capital of the Austrian Empire . He would write political pamphlets on German nationalism throughout his lifetime . He would also write ( and far less happily ) pamphlets attacking the Jews - which in time would be picked up by fellow German anti-Semites , such as Adolf Hitler . If you recall in the film HELLO DOLLY , when Vandergelder ( Walter Matthau ) is marching in the huge 14th Street Parade , there is a float in honor to Wagner from a German society . This was not usual with other prominent composers in the 19th or 20th Centuries ( even Beethoven or Brahams or Tschaikowski ) . [ Back in 1972 , I was in the rare book and map room at the old B . Altman Store on Fifth Avenue and E . 34th Street . I was shown a manuscript for Lohengrin that was being sold . It was the first published manuscript in Italian of that opera . Wagner's writing was on some of the pages - he was re-translating the Italian translation of his lyrics back into German ! ] This fellow , flaws and all , was a really fascinating one . He was more than just the average racist and bigot . He was a scoundrel , frequently spending huge sums of money that did not belong to him - and leaving some misguided arts patron footing a huge debt at the end ( this happens in the series when Wagner has to flee Vienna in the 1860s after his debtors threaten court action ) . He was over sexed , betraying his first wife many times ( even before he betrayed his best friend Von Bulow , the conductor , by wooing away the latter's wife Cosima ) . In the end even Cosima , who shared her husband's vitriolic hates and super-nationalism was betrayed by him . . . although she had the privilege of watching him die of a stroke . Burton played the role well , showing the mental strength and the character weaknesses of a man who , for better or worse , helped shape the culture ( or kultur ) of Europe for seventy years . It was not only dramatic moments , such as his confrontation with officialdom ( John Guilgud as one of several Munich government ministers who try to corral or deal with him ) but comic ones , such as his dealing with his firmest ally , the . . . err . . . eccentric King Ludwig II of Bavaria ( Lazlo Galfi ) . The scene when Ludwig arrives incognito to learn at the feet of his maestro in Switzerland is pure high comedy , with a perplexed Burton and a nervous Vanessa Redgrave ( Cosima ) wondering how to handle having this royal nut without hurting his feelings ( and even probing whether his desire to abdicate is worth pursuing - it turns out it isn't ! ) . In the end Ludwig did create the permanent Bayreuth festival center for Wagner's operas to be performed . Like his three mad castles in Bavaria , the Bayreuth center remains active . The series also strengthens our grasp on another cultural icon of the age who was briefly in tandem with Wagner : Friedrich Nietzche ( Ronald Pickup - who curiously portrayed Verdi in a mini-series a few years earlier ) . Nietzche gradually became disillusioned by the great Richard . The theory of the superman was a universal idea , not specifically for Germans ( as Wagner suggested ) . More interesting was the effect of Wagner's racism . Nietzche was anti-Semitic too , but after hearing the table talk at Richard and Cosima's parlor ( which suggested hideous mass murder ideas ) , Friedrich started realizing there was a limit to racism before it was too late - he repudiated Wagner before the latter's death in 1883 . But by then most of Wagner's friends had repudiated the man . As said before the super racists like Hitler picked up on Wagner's crack-brained racial ideas . Hitler would place his full seal of approval on Wagner in the 1930s and 1940s by attending performances at Bayreuth , acting like a member of the composer's family ( they referred to him as " Uncle Wolf " - a suitable nickname , unless you like wolves ) . However , one questions Hitler's actual admiration for Wagner's music , with it's use of leitmotifs and themes , and odd sexual habits ( incest among them ) . It is known that after the second act of the operas Hitler would leave . . . he is not known for sitting through an entire performance . Given that some of the operas run over five hours , this is understandable . For all the flaws of the great composer , the music remains to entice us into listening . Burton caught the genius and the flaws quite well . Redgrave , Pickup , Guilgud , Richardson , Olivier ( again using his " Bassermann " accent - see I WAS A CRIMINAL ) do well in the series . I recommend it - it does show much that is glossed over in music appreciations courses .
491636	3280905	89358	8.0	A Nice Farewell Pairing for Gleason and Carney .	For some reason , despite repeated reunions in their " Honeymooner " roles as Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton , Jackie Gleason and Art Carney never appeared together in a straight ( or close to straight ) film until a year or so before Gleason died . Then they appeared in this made-for-television film about Prohibition American , and two of it's forgotten heroes : Izzie Einstein and Moe Smith . As has been mentioned before this is not historically accurate by any standard . But it is nice as a record that the two stars ' chemistry could sustain a non - " Honeymooner " plot . Historically Izzie and Moe were Prohibition agents . That would actually set the public opinion of them at a low , as most people ( except died-in-the-wool prohibitionists ) disliked the rise in crime across the country due to the idiotic Volstead Amendment . Most of the Prohibition agents were a humorless , businesslike group . The only one who permanently raised himself above the bunch was Eliot Ness , by his memoirs THE UNTOUCHABLES , which became a hit television show . But Izzie and Moe almost did the same . From 1920 - 1926 their antics at swooping down on illegal gin mills and distilleries convulsed the nation . Izzie and Moe used a wide variety of disguises . They could come into a speakeasy as Harvard professors , or as doctors , or as actors , or as drunks . . . whatever , if they knew it would not raise suspicion they would try it . And when they did , the newspapers printed the stories . . . which delighted the public who otherwise might have supported the speakeasies and not the government . Finally , in 1926 , the Department of Justice fired them as agents : they claimed that their notoriety had rendered them useless as effective agents . In reality it was pure jealousy . They were the only two agents ( before the belated arrival of Ness ) who gained public liking . The actual story would be worth a serious retelling in movie form . That is not the case here , which does touch on their use of colorful disguises ( although I don't think either of them ever dressed up as a woman ) . It does show the failure of Prohibition due in part to corruption within the Department of Justice and it's agents . However , the story of Moe's ( Carney's ) so-called romance with a speakeasy hostess named Dallas ( based on Texas Guinan ) is totally false . Also the fight against one super mobster ( based on Dutch Schultz in the film ) is not true either - he was one of many targets for them . But with such defects the film is good to watch the two old pros having a ball in the gin-mills of the 1920s . Hopefully it will be released again sometime .
493413	3280905	134744	8.0	Edward as the Evil One	A nice little short subject , sometimes rerun on TURNER CLASSICS , it gives Edward Arnold his one chance at playing Satan . Coming only a year after Arnold faced Satan ( Walter Huston ) in ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY , here Arnold had his chance to be compared to Huston , Laird Cregar ( HEAVEN CAN WAIT ) , Claude Rains ( ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER ) , and others . It's also his only chance to be seen wearing a full beard on camera ( pointed at the tip , and with eyebrows reminiscent of Eric Campbell's opposite Chaplin , but subtler ) . We see Arnold in an office behind a large desk , not quite as fashionable as Cregar's but ( under the circumstances ) respectable . He rises from his desk and introduces himself as the Devil , and explains how he can help people with all sorts of goodies like armaments , propaganda machines , goose stepping soldiers . Soon there is a phone call and he answers , and it is his good chum Adolf , asking for more assistance to defeat the Allies . And Arnold soon is explaining that he can help by encouraging economic suicide - inflation . The idea ( seen dramatized in the short ) is how by hoarding or buying to much and encouraging manufacturers to continue doing " business as usual " , the public undercuts the war effort . It is an interesting theory , and has some validity . Presented here , with Esther Williams in her first role as a housewife caught in the realities of wartime economics , it is thoroughly understandable . Today , of course , it is Arnold's wonderful chuckly Devil that makes us like the short . As has been said on several of the other reviews , it is an interesting time piece of our own propaganda machine at wartime at work . Curiously , although Hollywood did not know it , the issue of " guns or butter " ( as it was referred to by Herman Goering ) was playing an odd role in of all places Germany . While the U . S . and England were sacrificing much to help their armed forces ( and Japan even more ) , Germany acted as if nothing was happening until late in 1944 ! Albert Speer mentioned in his memoirs that the German economy was still producing luxury items until late that year - apparently it was in an effort to keep the German population under the assumption everything was going well ( despite the heavy bombardments ? - Hitler and his advisers had blinders on much of what they were observing ) . It was only when France ( not Italy but France ) was lost , and Hitler nearly killed in an assassination plot , that the Nazis started a belt-tightening policy that really was tight .
492398	3280905	47209	8.0	Palance plays his " Jack " card	In 1944 Laird Cregar had appeared in the film version of THE LODGER which has generally been considered the best version of that film of the three versions ( although Hitchcock's silent version has it's admirers ) . Cregar's performance led to a follow-up film HANGOVER SQUARE , which proved to be his final performance due to a crash diet he put himself on that killed him . Nine years later 20th Century Fox decided to remake THE LODGER , and the current version starred Jack Palance . It was retitled MAN IN THE ATTIC - perhaps because the 1944 film had gained classic status . The story remains the same . It is based on a legend of the Ripper that keeps cropping up , most recently in the discussions of the connection of the painter Walter Sickert with the Whitechapel Murders . Sickert loved to discuss crimes , and he told the story about having rented rooms at a lodging house , and being told the former tenant of the rooms was suspected by the landlady of being Jack the Ripper . The prior tenant had only gone out at night , and came back disheveled , and would pounce on all the newspapers on those days that followed the next Ripper murder . However , this tenant had left the room when his health failed , and the landlady learned that he had died two months later . Sickert did tell this story to several people : Osbert Sitwell ( who wrote of it in his book NOBLE ESSENCES ) , Max Beerbohm , and Sir William Rothenstein being three of them . But no name was ever passed down on this suspect ( Rothenstein apparently wrote it down , but the writing was destroyed ) . The story became known to novelist Marie Belloc Lowndes ( possibly she heard it from Sickert or some common acquaintance ) , and she wrote a short story " The Lodger " which was subsequently expanded into a small novel or novella of the same name . Mr . Slade ( Palance ) is a pathologist at a London Hospital , who rents rooms in the lodging house of the Harleys ( Rhys Williams and Frances Bavier - " Aunt Bea " on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW " ) . Slade is very silent and mysterious , and slowly Mrs . Harley begins to suspect if Slade is the Ripper . However Mr . Harley keeps contesting her proof ( by the fact that he would act the same way as Slade would ) . The situation worsens when the Harley's niece Lily Bonner ( Constance Smith ) returns from a successful tour of Paris , to perform at the Picadilly Music Hall . Bavier is increasingly worried about her niece , who is the only person who can somehow make Slade relax and be friendly . In the novel / novella the actual guilt of Slade as the Ripper is left unsolved by his suicide before the police can act ( his death by drowning is also based on a rumor that the Ripper drowned himself - a matter as contentious as any other in the mystery ) . In this version Palance makes one suspicious for most of the film , but we feel he is capable of better actions ( and he is disgusted by some of his rival's , Detective Inspector Warwick - Byron Palmer - patterns of behavior , such as predicting he understands the Ripper or taking Lily for a tour , with Slade , through the Black Museum of Scotland Yard ) . The conclusion of the film actually is far more exciting than in the 1944 version ( complete with a horse and carriage chase ) . But the ambiguity of Slade's guilt remains here , unlike the 1944 version . When he does threaten - SPOILER HERE - Lily he can't bring himself to kill her , as he loves her . Palance brings this off well , unlike Cregar whose interest in Merle Oberon in 1944 was not as potentially romantic , but simply part of a religious mania . I still like Cregar's version of the central role better , but Palance's performance is well worth watching - as are Bavier , Williams , Palmer and Smith in support . I also note that this version is good in capturing some of the actual story . Sir Charles Warren , the Commissioner of Scotland Yard is mentioned , as is his resignation under fire in November 1888 . Another character is named as Chief Inspector Melville , an actual Chief Inspector of the Yard . Maybe not quite as atmospheric as the 1944 version , but not one to be casually dismissed out of hand either .
492776	3280905	50985	8.0	David v . Goliath in Sloughsborough	For people who think only of Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as the " parents " of Elsa the Lioness in BORN FREE , watching them in this film shows they were more versatile than the better known movie suggested . Both were trained actors , and could handle comedy ( they could also handle the classics : try to find a kine-scope of their television version of James Barrie's THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON ) . Here they have inherited a flea bag of an old movie house , which they would gladly sell if they could get a decent amount for it . But the town of Sloughsborough has a nicer , more modern movie house owned by Francis De Wolfe , and while he would buy out the flea bag it seems to him to be a buyer's market : so his offer for the flea bag is ( at best ) modest . There is a staff to the flea bag : Margaret Rutherford , Bernard Miles , and Peter Sellers . They are all made up to look like they are about sixty to seventy . Sellers at this time was showing that ( as Alec Guiness had done a little earlier ) he was a master not so much of disguise but of finding the different personalities that went along with those disguises . Every film he showed up in from 1955 to 1964 in England showed a different person involved . Altogether they gave him a film following that has not dissipated a quarter century after his death . Sellers nervous little Mr . Quill , with his " Crippen " style mustache and glasses , has one major weakness - one that De Wolfe uses to almost destroy the flea bag movie house . But even better is Miles ' quietly cagey " Old Tom " ( no last name given ) . He seems to be an elderly relic , but he does show surprising enterprise at the end - with somewhat shocking results . His physical appearance , with shaggy mustache and bald head , bears comparison and amazement to his physical appearance in say THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH ( 1956 ) or NICHOLAS NICKLEBY . It's hard to believe it's the same actor . Of the three Rutherford looks the least changed by the make-up . Her performance is also the least colorful , but she adds a quiet grace to the running of the flea bag movie house - a reminder of earlier days . The best moments of the film are when Travers and Co . slowly find ways of making the flea bag pay : they discover the power of heat and the movies they show , emphasizing deserts . Then - intermission - and the sale of drinks and snacks . It does allow them to make a slight profit - but in their conflict with " Goliath " De Wolfe , any profit is a major victory .
492144	3280905	45408	8.0	Leon Ames ' turn at bat	William Powell was such a great actor that to attempt to do one of his roles as well was highly difficult . His Nick Charles is light years more interesting ( in a handful of movies ) than the entire television series with Peter Lawford playing the same role . Occasionally an actor could duplicate his part as well as he - his doomed murderer lover in ONE WAY PASSAGE was done as well by George Brent in ' TIL WE MEET AGAIN . But Brent was an exception to this . Another example is the " snitch " character in BEAU GESTE . Powell's character in the 1926 silent film was really a total knave ( he was a sneak thief , a coward , and a snitch ) but J . Carroll Naish's reprise of the same character ( but with a different name ) in the 1939 sound version was equally memorable ( mostly due to Naish's hyena-like laughter ) . In 1947 Powell had one of his finest performances as Clarence Day Sr . in Michael Curtiz's LIFE WITH FATHER . Pompous and domineering and no nonsense , he is the perfect representation of the high Victorian " Pater Familias " of 1885 . His word is the law of the house ( theoretically ) , and ( as he says with unconscious self-mockery ) his is " the character " of his home . But he never realizes that , without trying to , his wife Vinnie ( Irene Dunne ) constantly undercuts his authority and control on household spending by confusing his questions on accounts by her logical illogic ( remember the exchange of the pug-dog for the " free suit " at the department store ? ) . Powell had only another decade of films left to him , and he never showed interest in television . He had nothing to prove with the public , and would leave the acting scene on a high note as " Doc " in MR . ROBERTS . But he may have been curious about the slight success ( from 1953 to 1955 ) of a television version of LIFE WITH FATHER starring ( for it's first two seasons ) a fine character actor Leon Ames . Ames had been in movies since the 1930s ( his first notable role as " C . Auguste Dupin " in MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE with Bela Lugosi - but under his real name of " Leon Waycoff " ) . Since then , while never achieving leading man status like Powell , he was in some juicy supporting roles , such as the clever District Attorney in the 1946 THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE , and as the head of the family ( who learns a lesson in what is important from watching his crying youngest daughter ) in MEET ME IN ST . LOUIS . Capable of good characters ( the angel in YOLANDA AND THE THIEF ) and villains ( twice against Powell in " THE THIN MAN " Series ) Ames was a good choice to play Mr . Day . I was too young to see episodes of television's LIFE WITH FATHER in the period it was on the air - but in the 1960s episodes reappeared on some of the " lesser channels " in the New York Metropolitan area such as channel 9 and channel 11 . It was a fairly interesting series , with attempts to show the Day family in their time period . Given the half hour episodes , more time could be spent on different areas of the culture , social mores , and even politics of the time . For example , Ames played Mr . Day like Powell did , being very outspoken and opinionated . In one episode he dislikes door to door salesman , and gets so upset at the junk his family buys ( in this case a defective egg " sheller " which destroys an egg when it's suppose to remove the shell ) that he writes a letter to the New York Times protesting door to door salesmen . The joke of the episode's plot is that Day finds his letter categorized as an attack on " free enterprise " . Since he is a stock broker his fellows on Wall Street are amazed at his views on the American economy ( then in the heyday of " laissez faire " ) . Ames , abetted by Lurleen Tuttle as Vinnie , did nicely as Mr . Day , but the writing of the episodes faltered . They tended to build up to his discomforting at the end of each one . Yet my memories of the best moments of the show are surprisingly warm . I don't recall the third season ( when Ames left the show and the role ) , and I wonder if any of those were ever re-aired . But when he was on he kept the show lively , and certainly did not fail to maintain the high standards that Powell set in the film version of six years earlier .
492463	3280905	92035	8.0	The First American Film to discuss the American Revolution in the South	As a follow-up to his wonderful FOUR SEASONS , Alan Alda wrote , directed , and starred in SWEET LIBERTY - a film that explores the way movies unmake books and historical accuracy , and film productions on location upset local populations . It's a good follow-up film , but not as good as FOUR SEASONS because that film had some serious underpinnings about friendship and aging at it's center . In SWEET LIBERTY Alda plays Michael Burgess , who lives is a southern college town with his mother Cecilia ( Lillian Gish ) . He is a professor of history , who has just written a carefully researched best seller about the events in the region from 1779 to 1781 when the British under Cornwallis invaded Georgia and the Carolinas in the American Revolution . I have mentioned this somewhat forgotten aspect of the Revolution in other reviews on this board , and how Cornwallis ' actually had a clever scheme that could have worked ( there were far more loyal Tories among the population there than further North ) , but how through the jealousy and foot dragging of Sir Henry Clinton ( Cornwallis ' superior ) the scheme slowly unraveled . Forced by the Americans under Nathaniel Greene into a series of " phyrric " victories , wherein he lost more men than the battles were worth , Cornwallis decided to fight his way to Virginia and to have Clinton pick up his men there . This led to his defeat at Yorktown . Burgess's book deals with the diary of a local woman who witnesses these events . It also deals with her having a love affair with Cornwallis ' " Green Dragoon " , the notoriously deadly Sir Banastre Tarleton . Tarleton has appeared under a different name in Mel Gibson's controversial THE PATRIOT , as the cavalry leader who did not mince words with the rebels . He exterminated them . The most notorious incident was when he ordered the massacre of rebels who had been captured at the Wraxhall River . But this was 1780 so war crimes trials were never heard of , and General Tarleton lived to die in his bed in 1833 . By the way - Tarleton never ordered burning alive civilians in a church to set an example ( that was a Gibson invention ) . Particularly an Anglican Church . King George III , as head of the Anglican Church ( and a serious believer in the religious rights of his flock ) would probably have ordered Tarleton's arrest and execution for such an act . Burgess sells the rights to his book to a film company , and soon realizes the hurricane he has released on his sleepy community . Burgess finds that he is working on the screenplay with Mr . Stanley Gould ( Bob Hoskins ) , who loves the book - but is constantly changing it to fit film consumers attention spans . The director of the film is little better than a presumptive kid named Bo Hodges ( Saul Rubinek ) , who has a ludicrous theory of what people want to see ( it includes mayhem , buildings being blown up , and people who are naked ) . Burgess has a close understanding with a fellow teacher named Gretchen Calsen ( Lisa Hilboldt ) , which may lead to marriage . But both find themselves enthralled by the film leads , Elliot James ( Michael Caine ) and Faith Healy ( Michelle Phifer ) . Both are temperamental egotists , but they can lay on the charm to improve their roles or enjoy themselves . Soon Burgess finds himself approving changes in the script that benefit Healy ( which leads to counter improvements for the insistent James ) . On top of all this Burgess has problems with his mother , a kindly woman who is partly insane . This also leads to him trying to resolve an issue regarding her past and a love affair she claims she had . The changes range from the ludicrous to the insulting . Remember that Tarleton was known as the " Green Dragoon " . A wealthy man , he dressed his crack cavalry regiment in green outfits , not in red . Hodges has James wear the traditional red uniform - American audiences expect " red coats " . The culmination of the film is the so-called turning point in the war in the south , the American victory over Tarleton at the battle of the Cowpens ( a bit of farmland - the victor was General Daniel Morgan , and it has been called the best tactical victory of the war ) . But Hodges wants to make it comic , with the Americans running around stupidly as the British bombard them . This , and a nasty confrontation between the film extras and the locals sets Alda up for leading his own revolution , and showing the film people just where to get off . SWEET LIBERTY works as a comedy , and is worth viewing . Besides Alda's growing frustration at the extremes of movie making , Hoskins friendly but ruthless script reworking , and Gish's comic insanity , and the obnoxious Rubinek , Caine does wonders showing ego and charm in it's turn ( see his rendition of " Knees Up Father Brown " when going out ) , and Michelle Phyfer's twisting Alda around her finger . It is certainly a fine film comedy .
491809	3280905	35555	8.0	A & C return to that other popular entertainment medium of the 1940s	We think of Abbott and Costello as burlesque comics , but the medium that gave them the national exposure allowing them to go into film was radio . It was on radio that the sharpness of such routines as " Who's On First " was demonstrated to millions , laying the groundwork for the film audience that Universal benefited by . And it was WHO DONE IT ? that was their film about radio . They are soda jerks in a restaurant in the building that a radio station is headquartered in . They both want to break into radio . But when they are finally on the premises of the station , they are among the witnesses ( and suspects ) at the murder of the station's owner ( Thomas Gomez ) . Due to Costello's continuous ability to make errors , they are suspected of the murder by the two detectives ( William Gargan and William Bendix ) who are assigned to the case . They are determined to try to solve the case and clear themselves . Gargan and Bendix were ideal foils for A & C , especially Bendix who meets Costello's dumb with dumber . The nadir for both cops is when they are guarding the front of the office building from Abbott and Costello entering it while the investigation is continuing . Bud and Lou , determined to enter the building , walk in backwards , so the cops think they are seeing them walk out ( at least momentarily ) . Rumor has it that Costello determined never to make another film with Bendix - he was jealous of the latter's getting more laughs than him . It may be true , but then Lou was doing pretty well on his own here . As it is a war picture , the mystery also deals with a spy ring . The actual perpetrator is a surprise of sorts at the end . A good comedy , I give it .
493407	3280905	26097	8.0	San Francisco's Experiment With Vigilantes ( 1851 - 1856 )	In 1848 the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican - American War , with the secession of territory from Mexico to the U . S . of most of the current southwestern U . S . ( California , Arizona , New Mexico , any claims to Texas - as well as parts of Colorado , Utah , and Nevada ) . This was a war of conquest by the U . S . , but to assuage American consciences fifteen million dollars was paid to Mexico for this territory . Only a subsequent bit of southern Arizona and New Mexico ( known as the " Gadsden Purchase " ) was made as an addition in 1853 by the Pierce Administration , giving us the current southwestern border . While the territory of Northern California ( as opposed to the territory of Baja or Southern California - still part of Mexico ) had always been a bit too far from Mexico City for proper control over local government , the change to Washington , D . C . - more than twice the distance and across a continent - further seemed to weaken national control of the territory . Moreover the population , being mostly Latino , was hostile to the non-Latino U . S . Government . It is in the next few years that California's so-called answer to Robin Hood , Joachin Murrieta , is continuing the Mexican War by his guerrilla / bandit attacks . Under normal circumstances , it would have taken a generation for the U . S . to be really bothered by this . But in 1849 gold was discovered in California , and the world rushed in . Suddenly the territory had nearly one million population within a year , and demanded statehood . This would lead to the controversy about admitting California to the Union as an free state , and unbalancing the balance of the U . S . Senate . This in turn led to the Compromise of 1850 which enabled California to enter the Union as a free state , but guaranteed a fugitive slave act as a sop to the South . It put off the Civil War ( or ignited the path to the Civil War ) ten years later . But for a big state , with wealth and population and size , California had a bad reputation . The towns of San Francisco and Los Angeles boomed in population - in particular San Francisco with it's immense harbor . But their governments were pitifully unable to maintain public order . Fires ( arson caused ) were frequent . So were killings , usually tied to robberies of the prospectors with more gold than sense . Judges and police were frequently paid off by gamblers and crime gang leaders . Finally , in 1851 , the better elements of San Francisco put their foot down and formed a vigilante committee . They arrested several dubious characters , held stream-lined trials ( where many legal niceties were ditched ) and if the parties were found guilty ( which usually happened ) they were hanged in public . It sort of calmed things down , but then the continued prosperity of the state caused the same problems to reappear . In 1856 two incidents reignited the Vigilante Committee . First a local outspoken newspaper editor , James King of William , was shot and killed by a corrupt local political alderman named James Carey . Then a gambler named Charles Cora shot and killed a police official . Both men were arrested , given the drum-head trial , convicted , and hanged . The Vigilantes retained control of San Francisco for the rest of the next year before disbanding . They never had to make a third appearance . Were they real heroes or a lynch mob ? It still is debated . James King of William was right about the corruption and crime , but he was a " Nativist " , and his attacks were also against Catholics , such as Carey ( an Irish American ) and Cora ( an Italian American ) . Many of his fellows were also Protestants , and some may have had pecuniary interests in attacking the businesses controlled by the Catholics . So the real situation is not black and white , like this film suggests . Edward G . Robinson's Luis Chamalis was based on Charles Cora , although the triangle with Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrae is from whole cloth . Col . Marcus Cobb ( Frank Craven ) is based on James King of William ( although King of William was never reduced to such stunning superficiality as Cobb is for nearly a year ) . Robinson's grip on the whole of San Francisco is fictitious ( Cora never had that much power ) . The leadership of the Vigilantes ( Harry Carey ) reflect the moral center of the Vigilantes movement that was unquestioned in American History books of the 1935 . It is a good film , with fine performances by Robinson , Hopkins , Craven , Brian Donleavy ( who's physical appearance makes him look like the corrupt contemporary Mayor of New York City , Fernando Wood ) , and Brennan . McCrae is sturdy and acts well , but his role seems terribly naive . It is fun trying to locate David Niven as a drunken cockney sailor tossed out of Robinson's saloon ( he recalled it fondly in THE MOON'S A BALLOON ) . Robinson's recollections of the film were downers in ALL MY YESTERDAYS : he had political disputes about the on-coming World War II with isolationists Hopkins , Carey , Craven , Brennan , McCrae , and director Hawks . Hopkins kept trying to upstage him and the others , until he let her have it before the cast and crew ( who applauded him for it ) . He also felt the end was a let down . Quietly told by Carey and his associates it is time to accompany them to his neck stretching party , he quietly joins them , as though they have come to take him to deliver a political speech ! Still the film merits an " 8 " out of " 10 " .
493395	3280905	45317	8.0	If Married Couples Had a Second Chance . . . .	In the early 1950s there were several episodic movies that came out of 20th Century Fox , two of which had early performances of Marilyn Monroe . The two were O'HENRY'S FULL HOUSE and this film , WE'RE NOT MARRIED ! The O'Henry anthology had stories that were funny ( " The Ransom of Red Chief " ) and stories that were moving ( " The Gift of the Magi " ) , and stories that were tragic ( " The Last Leaf " ) . But WE'RE NOT MARRIED ! was pure comedy , and as such worked quite well . It is based on an old plot ploy that turns up in other films , like Hitchcock's MR . AND MRS . SMITH . What happens to a married couple , after a couple of years of marriage , when they discover that there is a flaw in their marriage that invalidates it ? Like MR . AND MRS . SMITH , the flaw here is the legality of the license . . . of the justice of the peace . And in WE'RE NOT MARRIED , the nice but bumbling justice of the peace is Victor Moore . Moore had gotten word that he was appointed to the job , and began marrying as soon as he got the letter . He did not notice that he was not to marry anyone until a particular date . As a result there are at least six couples that he married who are technically living in sin . How do they handle the problem ? In MR . AND MRS . SMITH , Robert Montgomery's attempt to dismiss it as a minor problem almost destroyed his marriage ( as Carole Lombard wonders what kind of man he really is ) . Here the stories are able to look at the situation carefully . The results are far more cynical in three cases . Louis Calhern , a millionaire , marries Zsa Zsa Gabor ( a gold digger ) who arranges to frame him so she can divorce him and get a bundle . Calhern , confused and not knowing what to do , gets the letter from Moore and suddenly realizes Gabor has no legal standing to do anything ( this was long before the concept of " palimony " ) . Suddenly , to the consternation of her attorney ( Paul Stewart ) and Gabor , not only is Calhern cooperative , but he's positively full of information about hidden assets . At the very conclusion he drops the shoe on Zsa Zsa by giving her the letter as a personal message of a deep feeling for her . As he leaves the room we hear her faint . Walter Brennan ( in a section of the film that was cut originally but has been restored ) is a backwoods Lothario who loves to charm Hope Emerson . Emerson is married with several kids ( which Brennan knows about ) but he keeps saying how he'd love to marry her if only she were free ( Brennan does this because he really loves Emerson's cooking - charmed by him she is feeding his lying face ) . Then she gets the letter from Moore , and asks Brennan to read it ( Hope can't read ) . Brennan realizes what it's about , and hastily lies about the contents , and says it is junk mail . Then he destroys it . Little does he realize , after that sequence ends , that Moore and his wife ( Jane Darwell ) are discussing the rural address and problems of delivery there , and decide to send a second copy just to be certain . Paul Douglas is married to Eve Arden , but their marriage is in one of those rut periods . When he gets the letter , he starts imagining his new freedom , dating another good looking woman each night . Only at the end of this dream does he suddenly envision the cost of such a lifestyle ( an expensive cost for 1952 ) . At the end he decides to forget about the gorgeous women and look at how nice , peaceful , and stable that rut he's in really is . There are also stories involving Mitzi Gaynor and Eddie Bracken , Marilyn Monroe and David Wayne , and ( possibly best ) Fred Allan and Ginger Rogers as a bickering couple who are like Dorothy Kilgallen and her husband Dick Kalmar on radio's " Breakfast With Dorothy and Dick " . While not the greatest of film comedies , it's pretty consistently amusing in getting as much mileage out of the central plot ploy . Certainly worth watching and enjoying when it turns up on television .
492104	3280905	52948	8.0	A Hollow Earth : Such a Curiosity	In the 1820s Captain John Symmes was writing pamphlets , and lobbying in Washington for a scheme for a major exploration expedition he wished to lead . A citizen of Ohio , Captain Symmes wanted the federal government to organize an expedition to go into the Pacific , then head for the south pole . And once there , Captain Symmes believed they would find a huge hole - and once you entered it you would find that the interior of the entire earth was hollow from pole to pole . The inside would be quite temperate , even tropical . Possibly it could be settled by Americans . In the late days of the second administration of President Andrew Jackson , Symmes got his wish . The U . S . Exploration Expedition was commissioned to do an in depth survey of the whole Pacific ( and go as far south as possible ) . But Symmes was not chosen to lead it - it was lead by Captain Charles Wilkes , a temperamental career naval officer . In the end Wilkes was at sea for four years ( 1838 - 1842 : it began officially in the Van Buren administration , and ended in the Tyler administration ) . It's outstanding accomplishment was Wilkes discovery of the continent of Antarctica . Wilkes had some problems ( he was given a court martial for some error in judgment ) , but he survived , to commit a diplomatic disaster in 1861 called " the Trent Affair " , and ending up a rear admiral before being retired by Lincoln during the Civil War . Symmes did not see any of this . His daughter Anne married a young army hero and political would-be named William Henry Harrison . In 1840 Symmes ' son-in-law was elected President of the United States . He only served a month ( March 4 - April 4 , 1841 ) before becoming the first President to die in office . Nobody has ever found proof that Symmes theoretical hollow earth theory was remotely possible . We certainly have never found any connecting temperate world between the two poles . But the theory was discussed seriously in American and Europe . And one of those who latched unto it was Jules Verne , who uses it in his novel JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH . The novel and the film are not the same . First of all the name of the professor is not Lindenbrook ( a Scottsman ) but Liedenbrock ( a German ) . Some editions give his name as Professor Von Hardwigg . Secondly , except for Arne Saknassum , no member of his family is in the novel . There is no pet duck named Gertrude . There is no romantic pair of ladies to pair off with James Mason and Pat Boone . All those were added to the script by other writers than Verne . Still despite it's false premise with " the Hollow Earth " , and all of these changes , it is a fun film . Mason and Arlene Dahl make an interesting paring , Diane Baker and Pat Boone a reasonably good junior couple . Thayer David , a familiar and welcome performer in his day , finally had a decent lead role in this film . So I do recommend watching the movie , for all it's " flaws " .
492769	3280905	27345	8.0	A Fictionalization of a Tragedy	This 1936 film was the only movie about the Anglo-Irish War of Liberation ( 1916 - 1922 ) that centered on a character based on Michael Collins prior to the 1996 movie called MICHAEL COLLINS . Why it took so long to outwardly make a major film about the Irish hero is a matter of mystery to me . The best reason is that Hollywood did not wish to jeopardize English and British Empire sales of their films by painting a positive image of the man who gave them such a stunning black eye and won independence ( or technically semi-independence ) for Eire in 1922 . Hollywood would be willing to show a great Irish leader destroyed by a sex scandal ( the abysmal 1939 film PARNELL ) , but that leader failed . This 1935 film , BELOVED ENEMY , follows the general outlines of the events of 1921-22 . Collins , directing intelligence against the British forces , destroyed the Black and Tans and managed to make mincemeat of British operations throughout the provinces of Ireland ( except for Belfast and it's norther neighbors ) . Prime Minister Lloyd George and his advisers ( including Winston Churchill ) decided to have a peace treaty - but the negotiations were extremely difficult for all concerned . Lloyd George wanted to get the British forces disengaged , because the nation's prestige was badly shaken by it's increased defeat . The Irish negotiators ( led by Arthur Griffiths and Michael Collins ) were to try to get full independence if they could . However , Collins was put in charge of the negotiation team only because his one rival , Eamon de Valera , refused to go . This has remained a matter of controversy to this day , as to whether de Valera did this out of distrust of the British or as a cynical way of shafting Collins who would be blamed for the resulting treaty . Gumming up the work further were the Northern Irish Protestants ( Ulstermen ) led by Edward Carson and James Craig . They too were split ( Carson wanted all of Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom , as Great Britain was officially known in 1922 ; Craig just wanted to protect the six northern Protestant provinces from being part of the Catholic Ireland envisioned by Collins and de Valera ) . The resulting treaty basically satisfied nobody - and still doesn't . Eire was created as a semi-Independent part of the United Kingdon ( in a sense it achieved Parnell's long dead " Home Rule " parliament system ) . Northern Ireland got it's independence as a semi-independent section with it's capital at Stormont near Belfast ( Craig would become it's first Prime Minister ; Carson was disgusted by the decision and never accepted it ) . Griffiths died of natural causes a few weeks after the treaty was signed . Collins had to face the anger of de Valera , who rejected the result . Within two months Collins was assassinated by anti-treaty Irish , and a Civil War began that lasted a year ( and was bloodier than the fight against the British ) . Eventually de Valera would be elected President of Eire . In 1949 he formally removed Eire from the United Kingdom . The southern Irish state has remained independent ever since . The story was changed in BELOVED ENEMY . Based on a story that during the long negotiations Collins met and romanced an English aristocratic lady , the Collins character Dennis Reardon ( Brian Ahearn ) meets and falls in love with aristocratic Helen Drummond ( Merle Oberon ) , whose father is involved on the English negotiation team . When the treaty is presented to the world , and does not give the full independence that the Southern Irish expected , Reardon is denounced as a traitor . His closest friend O'Roarke ( Jerome Cowan ) decides to punish him for his treason by shooting him when he is riding in an open car ( as Collins was killed ) . The only difference is that here Reardon ( although wounded ) lives to return to his aristocratic lover . The film was well produced and acted , so despite trivializing a true tragedy by giving it a happy ending I will give it an .
492257	3280905	96668	8.0	In Memoriam : H . K . - 1927 to 2008	How does one appreciate one of televisions best comedians who never succeeded in the lead role of a comedy series ? Harvey Korman was always a positive element in any comic ( and some dramatic ) shows and films he appeared in . From his days as " Gazoo " in " The Flintstones " to his first appearance in weekly variety on Danny Kaye's variety show to his glory days as part of the weekly ensemble on Carol Burnett's variety show ( who can forget him as Eunice's husband , or as " Rhett Butler " or in the Charles Dingle part in the spoof of " The Little Foxes " - using the word " chitlins " as a minced oath ) , to his long association with Mel Brooks . . . Korman carved a nice niche for himself , frequently as partner to Tim Conway . And he did prove he could play drama as well . Just recall his performance opposite Buddy Hackett in the television film about Abbott and Costello , " Bud And Lou " . The devils and turmoils that destroyed those comic giants came through with the two unexpected performances . With such a record I felt it necessary to try to recall some unexpected work done by Korman that was just as good as the rest , but overlooked . One work was Korman as " Baron Hinterstoise " on " The Wild West " , a Bismarckian German schemer planning to destroy America's reputation so as to open up the western hemisphere to European colonization . There was also his performance as " Von Zeppel " the fanatical aviation pioneer on " F-Troop " , who gets Corporal Agarn to wear a Prussian military outfit complete with pointed helmet . But I noted the current obituaries brought in the long work with Mel Brooks , in the films " Blazing Saddles " , " High Anxiety " , " History Of The World Part I " , and " Dracula : Dead And Loving It " . Interestingly enough the obituaries failed to note how Korman and fellow Brooks ' alumni Cloris Leachman were stars of this short lived comedy series , " The Nutt House " . Except for " Get Smart " Mel Brooks has not had great success on television ( or any further great success - " Get Smart " being in a class by itself ) . His 1970s series , " When Things Were Rotten " was his first attack on the Robin Hood myth ( later revisited in one of his movie spoofs ) , and despite some decent scripts did not succeed . Yet it lasted longer ( by about four months ) than " The Nutt House " . " The Nutt House " lasted a big month , and ( apparently ) was so poorly received by the public that the last two episodes never were aired . Yet it was better than the public and the critics gave it credit for . " The Nutt House " was a type of spoof on novels or stories or movies like " Hotel " or " Grand Hotel " or " Weekend At The Waldorf " or " Plaza Suite " . Set in a famous hostelry owned by Leachman , with Korman as her hotel manager , each week's episode dealt with some problem facing the hotel that threatened it's existence or had to be overcome . Korman , trying to follow the instructions of his employer ( who was also his would-be girlfriend - something Korman is constantly trying to avoid ) . It actually worked quite nicely , although sometimes it actually left comedy and again showed Korman's handling of drama . In one of the episodes a master jewel thief is at work in the hotel , and the staff from Korman down is aware of this . But Korman is also aware of pressures on himself because he is the manager that are beginning to make him doubt his abilities or his courage . But the conclusion of the episode was not funny but actually heroic . With the jewel thief holding several of the cast at bay with a pistol , Korman stumbles into the scene by chance to talk to a young woman who has been attracting him ( actually a frightened partner of the jewel thief ) . The situation suddenly brings out Korman's total frustration and anger at the jewel thief , whom he rightly calls a phony and coward who pretends to be clever and brilliant but actually is so frightened he needs a gun to force a poor woman to protect him . This flusters the jewel thief enough to make him lose his edge and get captured though he manages to fire his gun before being rushed . Korman starts leaving when he realizes what his indignation almost cause happen . He faints as a result , thus reminding us that it is a comedy show . The episodes had neat tricks in them . In one episode Leachman thinks she has manipulated events so that Korman will end up marrying her . But he gets knocked out before he can answer " I do ! " at the ceremony . Leachman looks at various cast members about whether Korman's body language said the critical words or not . They all just shake their heads " No " . At the end she looks at the camera beseechingly at the audience for their support . The camera shakes it's " head " " No ! " too . Korman and Leachman gave the show all they could as did Brooks , and it should have succeeded . Instead , it is in that select group of shows like " He And She " that were not successful , but ended being fondly remembered by those who caught them - and who now wish they were available on DVD or Video . And it represented another proof of Harvey Korman's best work . . . for which he'll be remembered by his myriads of fans .
493404	3280905	106673	9.0	The Plot To Control The White House	In 1939 Akim Tamiroff , Lloyd Nolan , Patricia Morrison , Mary Boland , Robert Warwick , and George Zucco , appeared in a film called THE MAGNIFICENT FRAUD . It was about a political murder in a Latin American country , and how an actor is forced to replace the murdered President to save the country in the middle of crucial negotiations . Tamiroff carried off the improbable plot very well , bringing a growing courage and determination to his actor who finds that he has a political conscience after all . Although the movie MOON OVER PARADOR had a similar plot to THE MAGNIFICENT FRAUD , it is DAVE that actually shows a greater link . This 1993 film deals with Dave Kovak ( Kevin Kline ) , a part-time actor and full time head of an employment agency ( where he is assisted by his friend and landlord Murray Blum ( Charles Grodin ) . Kline also plays President William Harrison Mitchell , and it is his resemblance that brings him to the attention of the head of the White House staff Bob Alexander ( Frank Langella - a very good performance ) and the Communication Director Alan Reed ( Kevin Dunn ) . They need Dave to replace the President for a few minutes after a speech . He just has to leave a hotel in place of Mitchell , and go to a limousine , and he'll be deposited back at his own address . The President can then go to another secret appointment ( for a tryst ) . Dave does what he is supposed to , but the President does not . Mitchell has a stroke . So Langella and Reed face contacting Vice President Nance ( Ben Kingsley ) to take over the administration . But Langella hates Nance ( he and Reed refer to the honest official as a " boy scout " ) . Langella realizes that as long as Dave continues playing the President the administration can continue until health issues allow him to quit . The real administration's brains will be Langella ( and Reed's to a smaller extent ) . Nance , in the meantime , can be framed in the failure of a Savings and Loan Company - one actually looted by Langella and the now incapacitated President . There are two flies in the ointment . One is Nance , who is sent on a long good-will trip to Africa ( while the framing takes place ) . The other is First Lady Ellen Mitchell ( Sigourney Weaver ) , who has been estranged by her husband for years . She might notice the difference . Actually there is a third . While the real President Mitchell was not overly concerned about the problems of his poorer countrymen , Dave is interested in this . He actually tries to make a difference , only to be quickly put into his place as a useful fraud by the arrogant Langella . Or has he been ? Soon Langella finds that his useful fraud puppet has a mind of his own , and a way to circumvent and humiliate Langella . Like all " perfect double " substitution movies this depends heavily on suspension of disbelief , but the cast plays very well . Witness the scenes between the stolid Secret Service man Duane Stevenson ( Vhing Rhames ) and Kline as Dave , who is trying to open up this guard by being friendly , only to find himself facing an official coldness on the issue of whether or not Rhames would take a bullet for him . Or the scene where Grodin comes to visit Dave at the White House , and helps him with a problem regarding balancing the national budget . Weaver , first hostile , than suspicious , and finally supportive , gives one of her two best comic performances ( witness her singing " Tomorrow " ) . The film is quite a nice comedy , and the appearance of a future Californian governor in one sequence adds a strange feeling to the film .
492216	3280905	24411	9.0	Barrymore's Wonderful Life - But as " George Bailey " not " Potter "	This was the third of the rediscovered films that Meriam Cooper had taken out of circulation in a business deal with RKO back in the 1940s , that Turner Classic Movies showed on Wednesday , April 4 , 2006 . Of the three it is the best , mostly due to a strong story about a country doctor over the years who discovers in the end that he was not the failure he felt he was , but that he gained the love and respect of the people of his town and of highly regarded medical specialists in New York City . Lionel Barrymore was the first of the famous trio of siblings to gain an Academy Award ( for A FREE SOUL in 1930 - 31 ) wherein he gave a terrific performance as a hard drinking criminal attorney who pulls himself together to save his daughter ( Norma Shearer ) from the gallows . His character in that screenplay had been based on the celebrated California attorney Earl Rogers , father of screenwriter Adele Rogers St . John . It remains one of the best of the early male Oscars . And he would fill the screen with other performances , frequently of crusty old gents with plenty of wisdom , in films like CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS and ON BORROWED TIME and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU . All too frequently his detractors note a hammy tendency that got into his acting , it's true , but even when he is hammy Lionel can produce interest in whatever he's doing on stage or screen . Here he is Eli Watt , a doctor who is returning to his native town with his six year old son Jimmy in tow . He tells the local banker ( Oscar Apfel ) that he could not make a real go of it in the big city , so he felt he should set up practice back in his home town . After getting a smaller mortgage than he would like ( ironically he asks if the ink in his pen that he needs to sign the mortgage is free ! ) he sets up shop . Soon he is having his first customer . David Landau ( the President of Darwin College in HORSE FEATHERS ) is a farmer whose wife is pregnant . They don't have money , but can pay Watt in two bushels of potatoes . Watt ( taking his son along ) goes to Landau's farm . Unfortunately , while he saves the baby daughter that the wife gave birth to , complications killed the wife . A bitter Landau refuses to listen to Barrymore's attempts to get him to accept the little girl , and throws Barrymore , the baby and Barrymore's medical bag out . The little girl is named Lettie by Barrymore . With the assistance of a housekeeper / old friend named Sarah ( May Robson , in a typically great performance ) , Barrymore raises Lettie with his own son . However , four years later a reformed and penitent Landau returns , and convinces Barrymore to let him raise daughter again . As it turns out Landau really does reform , and Lettie grows up ( as Dorothy Jordan ) to be a decent person . The film actually follows the odd situation Barrymore faces in the small town . He is the man the locals all go to for medical advice , and he is willing to take produce for it ( much to the amazement of Apfel , who has to keep giving extensions on that mortgage to Barrymore as a result ) . We also see Jimmie grow into Joel Mcrae , and assist his father , until he is ready to study medicine too for a career as a doctor . Barrymore's moments of glory are mostly quiet ones . In the 1930s it was more common for doctors to do " house calls " than today - unfortunately - and Barrymore is seen going in all kinds of weather , even being upset in a sled ( by the snow ) on a call . Then he successfully fights a small pox epidemic among the poorer farmers when the local county medical group are busy with a typhoid epidemic . His success there is the first time his activities gain state wide attention . Lettie assists in the small pox epidemic , and later she and her boyfriend Bill ( James Rush ) are in a car accident , that Barrymore again shows himself at his best in . He saves Bill's broken arm by fast emergency service , before Bill is taken to New York for final surgery . Mcrae is one of the surgeons with Barrymore in this event , and a leading New York specialist ( Hale Hamilton ) suggests that Barrymore could still make a first rate career in the city's leading research complex . And here is the interesting point of the film - wherein I will cease further comments on the plot in specifics , except to say Barrymore does have his day of glory . It seems that the plot of this film looks ( remarkably so ) like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . I realize that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was supposed to be based on a story by Philip Van Doren Stern called " THE GREATEST GIFT " . But the whole spirit of that film is that George Bailey wants to leave Bedford Falls and win his fortune outside in the great world . Every time he is about to do so he is prevented by the death of his father ( oddly enough Samuel Hinds , who appears in a small role in this film ) , or by the actions of Potter , or the timidity and selfishness of the townspeople . The same thing happens here to Dr . Watt . He is in the position to leave , and comes close once to do so , but the illness of a friend prevents him . He never has his chance to show what he can do . Of course , Watt ( like George Bailey ) does discover he was a great success because he helped his neighbors despite everything ( as George did in the later film ) . But isn't it really ironic that the hero in this film is played by Lionel Barrymore , who was the devil incarnate villain Potter in the later film ?
493033	3280905	82970	9.0	A Fascinating Portrait of Turn - Of - The - Century - America	When RAGTIME was published in 1980 it was a big best seller , establishing E . L . Doctorow as a leading popular novelist , and also showing the way to Mr . Doctorow to future literary work set in other periods of American history . It was optioned for the movies , and became a hit of the 1981 film season . Guaranteeing it's success was the announcement that after nearly two decades ( except for some minor television appearance dealing with conservation ) James Cagney was going to reappear in the film , in an important supporting part : the somewhat corrupt New York City Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo . Actually RAGTIME had several " old time " faces in it . Cagney's pal , and frequent co-star , Pat O'Brien played Harry Thaw's lawyer Delphin Delmas . And in a smaller part , Donald O'Connor appeared as a singer and dance teacher who was part of the cast of " Mademoiselle Champaign " , the musical that was being shown at the Madison Square Garden on June 18 , 1906 ( the night architect Stanford White was shot and killed by millionaire Harry K . Thaw ) . Interestingly enough , when I first saw RAGTIME , it was at a theater that stood on Northern Blvd . , in Queens . There were two theaters , one showing RAGTIME and one showing GHOST STORY , a film that starred Fred Astaire ( his last film ) , John Houseman , Melvin Douglas , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . The affect of seeing all these old time actors on the marquee of the theater was to make me look at the cars on the road to make sure they did not all have rumble seats and running boards . The story was cut in the final movie that was shown . Emma Goldman and Harry Houdini , among other real characters , were in the shot film , but their sections were cut ( in some DVDs theses sections are sometimes shown as extras ) . Houdini's role was rather important , for in the plot he was supposed to demonstrate an escape trick to the Younger Brother ( Brad Dourif ) that he was going to use later on to aid Coalhouse Walker's gang ( Howard Rollins ) . Emma was supposed to represent the rise of labor as a force against the powers of the rich . She also was to undercut the blare of the Hearst Press regarding the White Murder Case , which was called the " Crime of the Century " . " How can it be the crime of the century , " Emma asks with amazement , when the century is only six years old ? " J . P . Morgan and Henry Ford also appear , forming a club for themselves only as America's two richest men , and going to Egypt on an archaeological trek . Morgan's mansion and library ( still there on East 32nd Street and Madison Avenue ) and Ford's Model T play important roles in the story too . Doctorow's novel was to show the growing pains of what is modern America , with the rise of American power under Teddy Roosevelt , the rise of immigrants and their contributions ( Goldman , Tateh the future movie pioneer : Mandy Pantikin ) , the rise of African-American self-respect and struggle for equality ( Coalhouse / Rollins ; his wife Sarah / Debbie Allens ) , the power of the rich ( Harry Thaw's crazy acquittal - the " Million dollar defense " : Robert Joy ; and the deus ex-machina appearance of Waldo / Cagney to settle the final confrontation ) . The complications of the story are the collision of groups seeking equality and power , from the past ( the rich , the family that hires Coalhouse's wife Sarah ) , the African-Americans , the immigrants ( Houdini , Tateh ) . Inside the groups are conflicts . They younger brother becomes a committed revolutionary , while his older brother ( James Olsen ) is a remnant of conservative seeming sanity . Coalhouse finds his violent activism ( which is due to personal tragedy caused by bigots ) is opposed by America's leading African-American educator ( Dr . Booker T . Washington : Moses Gunn ) . Washington believes in self-respect earned by a bootstrap approach that will gain the admiration and support of the better elements of the White majority . Ironically , after he has helped unman Coalhouse towards the end of the story , Waldo and the other whites push him aside as though they consider him little better than , say , a Pullman Car porter ! The film was well directed by Milos Forman . The acting was quite good , including Cagney who was rather infirm at the time , but who is shown to advantage , and has his last good part . It was nice to see him going out on a high note here . Rollins was very promising , and it is a pity that he died so young from A . I . D . S . with so little shown for his talent . I can go down the list , including a brief performance by Norman Mailer as the ill-fated White . But take special note of Kenneth McMillan ( as Willie Conlin ) who is the bigoted fireman who mistreats Coalhouse and causes the tragedies . He is pretty good as a malevolent slob ( or piece of slime ) who ends up a pawn in a final game of sudden death that ends the movie .
492092	3280905	14341	9.0	Buster tales on the " chivalric " south	Not quite up there with THE GENERAL , THE NAVIGATOR , SHERLOCK JR . and STEAMBOAT BILL , JR . , OUR HOSPITALITY gives us encouraging signs of Keaton as film creator and thinker . He had done historical films before it - the film just before this was the amusing THE THREE AGES , which was somewhat influenced by the structure of INTOLERANCE ( not quite : the stories are parallel here like in INTOLERANCE , but Griffith blended the conclusions to show the results of intolerance are always evil , whereas Keaton has each story end separately ) . Griffith is an influence here to , in the matter of trying to impose historical correctness of detail . The result is Keaton spoofing it : showing Broadway and 42nd Street in 1830 based on an actual lithograph of the time , which shows that modern thoroughfare as barely out of the cow pasture age - even the cop stops a " traffic jam " by halting foppish Willie McKay on his early bone-shaker bicycle while a wagon has the right of way ! ( Keaton continues this later on in a throw away line , to spoof the cautions of an earlier age . Before he boards the train to take him south , he is warned by his mother , " Be careful of those Indians in Delaware ! " ) All great comedy skirts the edge of tragedy . STEAMBOAT BILL , JR . is resolved when a tornado hits the southern town it is set in , wrecks most of it , and sinks Mr . King's modern steamboat . The reason the ship in THE NAVIGATOR is set adrift is due to foreign agents of one of two countries currently at war . Keaton is fully aware of how close tragedy and comedy touch each other . In Our HOSPITALITY he has a ten minute prologue which could have been in a drama : Willie McKay's dad ( when Willie was an infant in the south ) has been insulted by the younger brother of Joseph Canfield ( Joe Roberts ) a neighbor . Apparently the insult was a mutual one . Despite the entreaties of his wife Mr . McKay goes out of his home armed . Canfield , likewise , tries to prevent his brother , but fails . We watch as both men basically spot each other in the dark , approach with care and fire - mortally wounding each other . Canfield dies on the spot , but Mr . McKay stumbles back to his home and dies . Joseph Canfield looks at the dead body of his brother and realizes that this begins the real matter of a blood feud . He regrets it , but hardens himself to prepare for a massacre . Mrs . McKay quickly leaves the house with baby Willie , fleeing town and heading North . It sets the stage ( though a logic question is dropped - given the threat to McKays in the southern town , why is Willie allowed to go back to claim his inheritance ? ) Willie heads south on the newly built railroad , which has wooden tracks that keep needing repairs ( at one point the train accidentally goes off the rails and continues puffing along like a set of coaches pulled by a steam powered automobile ) . The train contains more than Willie - he has met a charming southern girl ( Nathalie Talmadge - in actual life Buster's wife ) , who happens to be the only daughter of Joe Canfield . He arrives with an invitation from her to her home for dinner . He plans to do that , and goes to see his great estate ( which turns out to be a little log cabin ) , and then heads for the dinner invitation . In the meantime word has spread to the Canfields that the last McKay is in town . They are planning on killing Willie when ( to their general consternation and surprise ) he shows up for dinner . What follows is how Keaton twists southern hospitality into a pretzel as Joe Canfield and his two sons keep an eye on Willie in the hope that he leaves the house long enough to be shot . At first Willie is unaware of all this , but gradually he realizes what is going on , and he is as determined to stay inside their home as long as possible . This delights Virginia Canfield ( Talmadge ) until she realizes the danger she has put Willie into . Soon she's trying to figure out how to prolong this visit beyond the conclusion of dinner . Eventually it is impossible to maintain the strained bond of hospitality . Willie flees into the forest , pursued by vengeful Canfields . The tricks here include a memorable demonstration on the dangers of the law gravity involving Willie and one of his pursuers and a ledge overlooking a waterfall . The waterfall also turned out to be nearly fatal - Keaton took a serious fall in the shooting , and did not realize for several years that he had broken his neck ( and survived ) . Another unconscious serious element is Joe Roberts - he had suffered a stroke during the filming , and insisted on continuing his scenes when he " recovered " . There are scenes where he is seen wandering in the forest , but acting really lost - like he can't tell what is going on around him . Roberts ( an old family friend of Buster's ) died later in 1923 , OUR HOSPITALITY being the last film he made with Keaton . Despite the downer of Roberts ' illness and Keaton's close call , the film works well , and remains consistently funny . As a second level Keaton film it is a good introduction to his work . As an intriguing look at Keaton's fascination with trains , it is a fine introduction to his masterpiece THE GENERAL .
493044	3280905	23027	9.0	Whatever it is , he's against it !	HORSE FEATHERS , the fourth of the five Paramount Marx Brother Movies , is one of their best - tackling the world of higher education in America . Groucho is the latest of the Presidents of Huxley College , which is doing very badly ( apparently ) not because of poor scholastic standards but due to not having a successful football team . His son ( Zeppo ! ) steers him toward solving this issue , but with typical Groucho ineptness he thinks the two semi-professional football players he is looking for are Harpo and Chico . He proceeds to regret his own mistake , until the climactic football game . The music numbers of this film are well remembered , particularly Groucho's introduction ( " I'M AGAINST IT ! " ) and " Everyone Says I love you " . The latter was sung to the anti-heroine of the story , Thelma Todd in her second and last film with the brothers . Thelma plays the " college widow " , a popular fictional figure in early 20th Century American humor - a euphemism for an ever-ready widow of a college professor who was there to have sex with students or the staff . George Ade , the humorist who wrote FABLES IN SLANG , wrote a play called " THE COLLEGE WIDOW " in the teens of the 20th Century . Thelma is certainly effective as the vamp trying to help David Landau ( President of Darwin College ) get the football signals of Huxley College . Her scenes with Groucho and Chico are quite funny . Chico is playing the piano and she sings . She says she has a falsetto voice . Chico says that's all right , his aunt has a false set of teeth . And Groucho , when taking Thelma for a boat trip throws her a lifesaver ( literally ) , while returning with a duck who interrupted his singing . The final football game is the second best spoof of college football on film ( the one in Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN is a better one ) . In the end we see the boys demolish football huddles , football signals , even hot dogs ( poor Nat Pendleton ) . A delightful antique , it is well worth watching . This is one film I'm not against .
493344	3280905	158310	10.0	The Follow - Up To Hollywood	When the series Hollywood was made in the late 1970s , it's producers had more than enough material for a series of over 10 episodes ( as it was shown ) . Especially the material dealing with interviews of silent film period survivors . The producers decided to do several follow-up documentaries . Three eventually were made , about Chaplin , Keaton , and Lloyd . This was the first . Taken from the Chaplin family film vaults , it showed ( in three episodes ) scenes that were filmed by Chaplin from movies that were actually finished but re-cut ( like CITY LIGHTS , THE CIRCUS , and THE CURE ) , as well as films that were made for private viewing ( a film with visitor Sir Harry Lauder ) , and film that was created for projects that did not work out . It was a wonderful series , and all too brief - mostly due to the tragic fact that Chaplin did not save all the cut material from all his projects and films . Try to catch this on DVD .
492295	3280905	50658	10.0	A Wonderful Romantic Comedy - despite a casting error of sorts	It is the forgotten gem of Billy Wilder's film career . Coming in that string of successful films of the late 1940s - 1961 , LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is probably less well known to modern audiences than SABRINA or STALAG 17 . Yet SABRINA has a similar casting error . There Audrey Hepburn played the love interest between William Holden and Humphrey Bogart , ending up with older brother Bogart . Yet somehow that is more acceptable than here where she is love interest to Gary Cooper , who was only a few years older than Bogart . I think the reason is that Wilder's casting in SABRINA was more astute in one way - he cast Walter Hampden in what proved to be Hampden's best movie part - the elder Mr . Larrabee - father to Linus ( Humphrey Bogart ) and David ( William Holden ) . Hampden looked old enough to be the father of both " sons " . But in LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON , Maurice Chevalier was ( in appearance ) about the same age as Gary Cooper . Chevalier played the father of Hepburn . It does not make Cooper's matching with Audrey Hepburn sit as well . A younger man was needed ( one can suggest Tyrone Power , whom would subsequently pop up in Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION ) . But Cooper did have one thing that makes his age problem seem less important than it should be . His public persona was that Cooper represented small town ( usually western ) America . He had won two Oscars for playing a Tennessee mountain boy who became a national hero in World War I ( SERGEANT YORK ) and an abandoned lawman in a 19th Century western town ( HIGH NOON ) . He did play occasional sophisticates ( DESIGN FOR LIVING ; BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH HONEYMOON ) but those were atypical films . In real life Cooper was a socialite - he hobnobbed with upper class types . This is similar to that elegant roué Frank Flannagan . One can see Cooper fitting that part of the role quite well . So despite the apparent May - September romance , Cooper and Hepburn act as similar sophisticates and their chemistry is not bad . What would have been the result with another actor like Power or Cary Grant or Robert Taylor is hard to say - Grant had the sophistication , and Taylor and Power had developed high acting ability - but Cooper was the actual article . LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is about a young woman , the daughter of a detective ( Chevalier ) who gets her excitement from reading the files of her father's client's cases . Frequently he is investigating the antics of the career of Frank Flannagan , an American millionaire who is so scandalously famous that the 1950s ' scandal sheet magazine CONFIDENTIAL has an entire issue naming him " Man of the Year " . One client ( John McGiver ) upon hearing his wife is having an affair with Flannagan decides to shoot him . Hepburn manages to get to the hotel where Flannagan is staying first , and warns him . McGiver does charge in , but does not find his wife there . Flannagan is grateful , but finds that while Ariane is willing to see him again she won't tell him who she is . She shows up at the hotel quietly , after attending her music rehearsals at the Paris Conservatory , and manages to keep Flannagan totally in the dark . Then he leaves the city for a year . They meet a year later , and he does remember her - so they resume their relations . But Ariane is totally in love with him , and she wants to test him . She gives him a " history " of her sexual life , fully as garish and full of incidents as his . And it drives Flannagan crazy - crazy enough to contact Claude Chevasse ( Chevalier ) to locate this fascinating girl . The film has many lovely touches in it , from Chevalier's opening about how Parisians are always kissing to McGiver's whining to Cooper's band of musical gypsies who always end by playing " Fascination " before he has his sexual encounters . If SABRINA aimed at bringing Hepburn and Bogart to Paris in the end , LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a perfect follow-up with the characters in Paris itself . It is a perfect love valentine to the spirit of romance , leading to a moving and sweet ending that is narrated in part by Chevalier . Despite that casting problem LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a beautifully made romantic comedy .
491649	3280905	52607	10.0	Thurber's THE CAT BIRD'S SEAT - moved to Scotland	Just like the criticism from feminists that Laurel & Hardy rarely paint a realistic picture of a wife , girlfriend , or woman in their films ( Mae Busch is certainly one tough customer against them ) , the writer - cartoonist James Thurber was also accused of misogyny . His female characters are eccentric , blasé about the worst tragedies that befall male characters ( a woman confronts a hippopotamus in the jungle , and we see the remains of a man's clothing and property on the ground - " Just what did you do with Dr . Millmoss ? " she asks waving her finger in the hippo's face , like she is a kindergarten teacher ) , and frequently fully ready to do battle to the death for domination of their male counterparts . So women do have a point , but Thurber is equally critical about the men who inhabit his planet too . All too frequently they are cowardly - witness his greatest fictional character , " Walter Mitty " , who retreats into fantasy to survive a dreadful life . Thurber did a series of cartoons entitled " The War Between Men and Women " that traces a genuine war between the sexes . It does end with a male victory ( femenists please note ) . But he also wrote this short story , " THE CAT BIRD'S SEAT " which is like an expanded version of an earlier tale called " THE UNICORN IN THE GARDEN " . In both , a Walter Mitty type man is confronted by a dominating wife or woman , and manages to turn the table on her by " proving " to the people who matter that the woman is crazy . " THE UNICORN IN THE GARDEN " was actually a Thurber fable , and it has been made into several films or television episodes ( one was on MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT ) . THE CAT BIRD'S SEAT is a little different . It turned out to be made into a film only once - in 1959 , and in Great Britain - not the United States . It's stars are Peter Sellers , as a meek Scotsman working in a century old textile firm in Edinburgh . It's current owner is Robert Morley , who has more money than sense . Morley has spent most of his time in London , so he has forgotten that the great capital of the North is a slower , more traditional place than the hated southern capital . Morley has met Constance Cummings , an energetic American businesswoman , who has depressed the morale of the American firm she has been working for . In fact , when the film begins , Cummings is told ( rather cruelly by a drunken Donald Pleasance ) that he was told to accompany her to London not for business conferences , but to unceremoniously dump her as she was boarding a train . Her male counterparts ( including Pleasance ) are entirely upset at her showing them up by her superior abilities and energy . Hence the way they drop her . Morley is too fatuous to understand what a danger this woman will be to his staff . He is just impressed at her stroking his ego , and her big ideas about expanding business by modernizing equipment and processes that have stood the test of time . Sellers , the business manager when Morley is usually away , watches with horror as a complicated inter office intercom system is put in for the staff to use to contact each other ( rather than just walking over to each other's desk ) . The wisdom of this development is shown to Morley when one of his employees ( while trying to get a cup of tea ) pushes the wrong button and says something insulting about Morley in his hearing . Other innovations are coming , and Morley is certainly under Cummings ' thumb . Sellers comes up with the idea of killing the American , and goes to her apartment . But at the last moment he just can't bring himself to do it . Instead , Cummings unwittingly gives him a better idea . Who'd believe he would ever visit her at night at her apartment ? Taking advantage of this , he starts telling her his wild " plan " to get rid of Morley and take over the firm with Cummings as his partner lover . He convinces her that he means business , and she tries to warn Morley , who has shown up for dinner . But Sellers , Morley , and Cummings ( in a well choreographed sequence ) keep missing each other in the apartment , so that the next day Sellers can deny he ever was there . Which may lead to Cummings leaving the firm . Or will it ? As a follow - up to THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY and THE MALE ANIMAL , THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES is worthy to be watched with them . Despite the expansion of the story to give it the Scottish atmosphere , and Morley's fatuous boss , everything works . And as with WALTER MITTY , after you've seen this read THE CAT BIRD'S SEAT to see what was the original tale like .
492393	3280905	130121	10.0	An Englishman among the Mafiosi	Hugh Grant is in someways a modern version of a comic actor who I have had problems with in viewing : Charles Butterworth . Butterworth would hem and haw , afraid of making some social faux pas while pursuing whatever business occupied his activities on screen . This diffidence while mildly amusing could get tedious after awhile . Similarly Grant will hesitate , and stammer a bit . But his English manners , and his good looks make his hesitancy far more easy to accept than Butterworth's . Certainly his good looks have made him an easy leading man type ( whereas Butterworth always played in supporting roles ) . MICKEY BLUE EYES gives Grant far more to be nervous and hesitant about . He plays Michael Feldgate , a highly successful auctioneer at a leading house in Manhattan ( his boss is Philip Cromwell ( James Fox ) ) . Michael has been romancing a schoolteacher named Gina Vitale ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) , and has finally decided to propose to her . Besides causing an unintentional series of uproars in a Chinese restaurant , he is surprised to find Gina less than enthusiastic . After he meets her father Frank Vitale ( James Caan ) he follows Gina home and learns the reason for Gina's lack of enthusiasm ( though not lack of love ) . Frank is a member of a Mafia family headed by Vito Graziosi ( Burt Young ) , and Gina was always afraid that if Michael and she married he'd be trapped into the Mafia way of life sooner or later . Uneasily Gina agrees to the wedding , with Michael insisting that with her assistance he can avoid any real problems from Graziosi and his gang . But soon the subtlety of the mobsters proves too much for Michael ( with or without Gina's help ) . Graziosi realizes that auctioning art can be useful as a way of laundering dirty mob money ( he can have debts paid by having various debtors settle what they owe by buying items the mob puts up at auction ) . And Michael soon finds he is auctioning art by Graziosi's violent mental case son Johnny ( John Ventimiglia ) that are setting records - records the F . B . I . are showing great interest in . While worrying about this , Michael is also under pressure of trying to present a good , respectable front for a potentially lucrative client . Somehow the mobsters and the F . B . I . just don't seem to help create this image . Michael finds that everything Gina suggests , or her father Frank tries to help with fails , and soon the Englishman finds he is in the middle of an unwanted killing - one that can set off a mob war . He also finds that he has to parade around town with his erst-while father-in-law as an out-of-town underworld torpedo named " Mickey Blue Eyes " ( actually , " Young Mickey Blue Eyes " from Kansas City , as opposed to " Old Mickey Blue Eyes " his dead dad , and the original " Mickey Blue Eyes " from Chicago ! ) . This includes burying a corpse in an overused waste land , and ordering steak in a restaurant where " Mickey " is barely understood talking a version of underworld English , and upsetting customers by his anti-English remarks and his constantly dropping his gun . The cast is wonderful , led by a continually drained Grant who can't find any way out of the deeper and deeper hole he is in , Caan who has found that he has a comfortable niche in the mob - but has somehow lost his daughter's trust , Tripplehorn who finds that she is bloodily closer to the mob than she ever expected or wanted to be , Young who is properly sinister but ruthlessly smart , and Fox who constantly trying to put the best face on the worst situations ( like talking to his potential client about respectability , opening a door , and finding Grant shaking his behind in front of his fiancé ! ) . Even that late budding comic " goon " actor Joe Viterelli ( who played " Jelly " in the ANALYZE THIS and ANALYZE THAT films ) has a nice moment where he watches a television commercial about a very strong adhesive tape that can even bind people's hands - and makes a note for future reference when he needs to bind some person's hands ! Until the last comic twists of the plot , the film entertains , and is certainly worth a " 10 " out of " 10 " on the scale here .
492003	3280905	37008	10.0	" She Gave Her Very First Kiss To You - It's Laura . . . But She's Only A Dream . . . . "	I guess LAURA will always make the top ten list of film noir because of it's wit and cast - in particular one actor who demonstrated a waspishness that had not been seen before in film except by his fellow homosexual actor Monty Wooley . I am speaking , of course , of Clifton Webb , who had been a great Broadway star of the 1920s and 1930s , and then ( when that career began to peter out ) got the nod to play Waldo Lydecker , and became a fixture of the movies from 20th Century Fox from 1944 to 1960 or so . Webb's carrying off the film's notices ( except for general approval of the work of Otto Preminger as director ) is ironic because the film's name centers on it's heroine : Laura , played by Gene Tierney . She is a career woman - a talented artist and advertising copy creator , who becomes a leading model - a fictional counterpart to say Grace Kelly a few years later . She does this when she gains the hard attention of Lydecker ( who initially rejects her attempts to talk to him ) but he has second thoughts . Later he admits it's due to his sexual fascination with her . The problem for Waldo is , of course , that no matter how much passion he does feel for Laura , he doesn't have the physical wherewithal to get an equal reaction from her . She sees him as a fine mentor and friend , but nothing else . And he feels this rejection keenly - too keenly . Today , a film version would show the sexual confusion of the man , as his personality shows his homosexual leanings ( they crop up occasionally towards Dana Andrews ' McPherson , who seems to have a muscularity that fascinates Waldo ) , and his definite wish to consummate with Laura . Poor fellow - it just was impossible . Yet it might have worked - a so-called " white marriage " like that of Cole and Linda Porter ( close friendship , but going their own ways sexually ) . When looking over Laura's attempts at a heterosexual boy-friend , Jacoby the artist ( whom Waldo maliciously destroys in his newspaper column ) and later Shelby Carpenter ( Vincent Price ) we see she wants a masculine hero . A case can be made , by the way , that Laura's interest in Jacoby was mere amusement ( we see her enjoying Waldo's column attack in the newspaper ) . As for Shelby , whatever was wrong with Waldo he certainly saw through the socialite as the questionable type he really was . In fact , McPherson ends up thoroughly agreeing on this with Waldo and in a physical way . The film ( as it is now ) gave her Dana Andrew's detective . He , it is , who rescues her in the end . But there will be a price . Leslie Halliwell , in discussing the film , pointed out that Waldo ( whatever his feelings about rivals ) respected Laura's true talents , and would have always encouraged her there , and assisted her in developing them . Andrew's McPherson expected his " dame " wife would be at home , cooking , cleaning , and ( presumably ) being ready for sex . Halliwell ended his discussion suggesting that Laura would have ended up missing Waldo's personality and support terribly . Curiously enough , the original film would have been quite different in it's resolution . McPherson goes back to Laura's apartment after he first meets all the suspects , and he sits on a sofa looking at her picture . He is supposed to meet Waldo , coming to assist on the investigation . The next forty minutes or so of the film is the heart of it , leading to the tragic conclusion as it now exists . But in the original script , we see McPherson being awaken by Waldo shaking him on the sofa . McPherson had dreamed the entire story the audience saw . He leaves with Waldo to jointly try to find the killer ( presumably it would have had to be Shelby ) . Whether or not it would have led to a " beautiful friendship " between effete newspaper / radio personality and detective is doubtful , but it probably would have led to some mutual sympathy .
492255	3280905	275375	10.0	Again a gem I caught on You Tube	The Second World War may be over sixty years old , but it still is quite alive as one of the most photographed and recorded conflicts of all time . The pictures caught by newsreels of the Blitz in London are among the most powerful images of that conflict - and may have done more to solidify American public opinion against the Axis than anything else before Pearl Harbor . But to the British it was not something to horrify an audience that would then turn around and go home to safe beds blessing the two large oceans that seemed to protect them . English , Welsh , Scots , and Irish were within bombing distance of German planes , and subject to months , even years , of attack . So this was a life-and-death matter . GO TO BLAZES is a brief comic short starring Will Hays , a name not too well known ( unfortunately ) in the U . S . But from 1933 or so up to the war he made a series of comedies with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott that critics have compared to the Marx Brothers - films like ASK A POLICEMAN or OH MR . PORTER ! . Hays is similar to Groucho in that he is always in a minor leadership post ( schoolmaster or cop ) which he bungles or uses for his own advantage , hampered by his even dumber two associates ( Moffatt is the fat young man , and Marriott is the elderly nincompoop ) . Somehow they ( like Groucho , Harpo , Chico , and Zeppo ) bungle their way to triumph in the end . In GO TO BLAZES , Hays is married to Muriel George , and they live with their grown up daughter Thora Hird . Hays is not too happy that George is not there to give him a hot dinner , but he's told it is in the stove . While his daughter is studying math , he tells her he has been asked to give a lecture on putting out fires from Nazi incendiary bombs . He is certain he's up to it , as he has read the pamphlet on the subject . We see him practicing before a mirror , and as he gives his speech we see the reality behind his expertise . He is dumb enough to try to carry his fire fighting equipment while still holding onto a pan of bacon he was cooking for his dinner . He keeps lucking out actually - he's so incompetent he can't stop one bomb going from the roof to the basement , accidentally landing into a bucket of water ( he claims he strategically placed it there . Ms George returns and she too is surprised that he is going to give this talk . Then they realize an incendiary has hit the house again , but while Hay acts with typical bumbling Ms George and Ms Hird act promptly and manage to control the fire quickly . At the end Ms George insists Hay take lessons on incendiary controls that the government is giving . He hesitates , until he learns where the classes are near . Less than ten minutes long it is an amusing comedy . Until now it is the only complete film of Hays I have been fortunate to see ( on You Tube , as I said above ) . I strongly recommend it as a way to see what this fine comedian was like . Also as a reminder of what the British public had to put up with from 1940 - 1945 in wartime .
492052	3280905	212346	10.0	What is the Value of the Modern Beauty Contest ?	A very funny film , with a first rate cast , MISS CONGENIALITY deals with examining the value of an American institution . When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the " Miss America " pageant ( as well as the other beauty pageant for " Miss Universe " ) . Watching Bert Parks ' singing the " Miss America " song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl . In fact , when Parks was fired from " Miss America " in the 1980s , the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert . But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s . There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years . Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions ( Question : " What do you wish for ? " ; Usual answer : " World peace ! " ) . Others , especially feminists , were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning " meat markets " displaying women for sex purposes only - and not really emphasizing women's brains . The pageants are still around , but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s . Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more ( the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams , who lost the title for an infraction of the rules , and subsequently had a successful - and still flourishing - acting career : something that rarely happens to the regular winners ) . Here , there has been a bombing ( and killing ) at the " Miss United States " beauty pageant . As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this . The team happens to find evidence that suggests a " Unibomber " type did , but they don't know for certain . One of the recent recruits , Sandra Bullock , is to enter the contest as " Miss New Jersey " . This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman ( and former " Miss United States " ) Candace Bergen . Bergen is not happy about the choice : Bullock is all professional FBI agent , with little in the way of a sense of fun , and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of make-up . The FBI team , headed by Benjamin Bratt , assigns a former member of the " Miss United States " pageant ( Michael Caine ) to " prettify " and prepare Bullock for her assignment . It almost leads to mutual murder . Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences . Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this . Bullock finds Caine insulting ( he admits to a stylish elitism ) , and she finds the new regimen impossible . Not only must she learn some talent ( they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses , like Ben Franklin's armonica ) , but she has to walk with poise , be graceful , and keep her weight under control ( some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables ) . She is also trying to see the value of the contest . Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism , and works hard at being a good agent . She sees the contest as a sexist , out-of-date affair . She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants , most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest . She is particularly protective about " Miss Rhode Island " ( Heather Burns ) , who seems to have self-confidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest . Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a non-professional manner : she and Bratt are both attracted to each other , but she can't find any time to make time for him ( nor he for her ) . If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest , or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine . This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair . Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen - a long time supporter of the contest , she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions ( and thus raising the image of women ) . And she resents the all-to-easy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest . The film also has it's version of Parks , in it's traditional host played by William Shatner . Certainly not the same as his " Captain Kirk " or even ( currently ) " Denny Crane " , Shatner's " Stan Fields " has a popular following among the older generation , who like his pleasant inane jokes ( you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke ) , and his singing the theme song . His performance is like additional icing on the cake . And a well made cake it is .
491862	3280905	32339	10.0	The Mysterious Disappearance and Reamergence of Lord Paddington	As mentioned earlier except for BLOCK-HEADS most aficionados might consider A CHUMP AT OXFORD to be the final great Laurel & Hardy feature length comedy . It's main weakness is it's structure - BLOCK-HEADS is a series of disasters rising to a crescendo from Stan to Ollie to everyone around them . A CHUMP is really two or three shorts ( all very funny ) that are united by the thinnest of plot threads . In fact it can be split into three shorts without difficulty . First there is the repeat of the story from FROM SOUP TO NUTS ( then a long forgotten silent short they made in 1928 ) , where they are hired to serve a dinner at Jimmy Finleyson's home one evening and destroy the dinner . The high point is when Stan is told to serve the salad undressed and does so - of course too literally for Finleyson's taste . He chases the two of them out with a rifle ( shades of Billy Gilbert in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES and BLOCK-HEADS ) . Finn fires his rifle , and then an angry policeman shows up warning him to be careful or he will go to jail - " You could have blown somebody's brains out ! " Unfortunately , the policemen turns around and we see that Finn shot a big hole into the cop's pants . Next we see the boys at a new job as street cleaners , and Hardy launches into one of those semi-sensible speeches he gives , " Well we've reached bottom now ! . . . What's wrong with us ? " Ollie figures it's a lack of education ( partly it is - though it's hard to see how Stan could comprehend any book ) . They foil a bank robbery ( the bank is called the FINLEYSON NATIONAL , which sounds reasonable as Finn was a canny Scotsman usually ) . As a reward they get their wish - they get the finest education possible at Oxford . The final segment is when they reach Oxford and fall victims to a series of pranks played by the students ( led by Peter Cushing - far from his future as Dr . Frankenstein - and Charlie Hall ) . The best part of this is the business of the boys getting lost ( even from each other ) in the maze at Oxford , where Ollie is carrying their trunk on his back , and yelling for Stan , who is yelling back , just around the corner ! There is also the student dressed as the bogeyman and sitting between Stan and Ollie on the trunk . There is also the boys settling into their rooms ( actually the rooms of the Dean of Oxford , Wilfred Lucas ) , ending with them shooting soda water into what they think is the face of an old goat in a portrait , and end up hitting the original face ( Lucas , of course ) . A battle of the expelled students ( the Dean catches them trying to leave his rooms ) and the boys ( " dirty rotten snitches " Cushing and Hall call them ) completes this segment - but introduces us to the biggest change in the history of Laurel & Hardy : Stan's revelation of his " real " personality . A tremendously creative and brilliant comic genius , Stan Laurel ( when busy constructing his films ) was all serious business - like Chaplin , Keaton , Lloyd , Fields , the Marxes , and Lou Costello , his peers . In this mode he was not the nincompoop he played opposite Hardy . He was very serious and intelligent sounding . This is his persona , with a degree of haughtiness , when playing his alter ego , Lord Paddington . Paddington was Oxford's greatest scholar and athlete . He proves the latter by throwing Cushing and the others ( unfortunately including Hardy and Lucas ) out his window one after another . He also demonstrates his brilliance quickly ( all these awards and trophies are on display shortly after his restoration - and worse when his new butler , Ollie , is overwhelmed hearing that Einstein is coming to discuss a problem about the relativity theory that Paddington can settle ! ) . Stan never tried this revelation again - and probably wisely . Stan and Ollie ( to work ) needs Ollie to be a bit more with it in terms of what the world expects - Stan follows , and upsets the easily toppled Ollie . It is similar to their silent film short , EARLY TO BED , where Ollie becomes a wealthy man about town , tormenting his butler Stan - we don't like this Ollie that much , and approve when Stan starts smashing Ollie's brick-a-bra-ck . The " Paddington " bit was better than the man-about-town Ollie in the earlier film . Wisely , Paddington leaves before the film ends , and Stan returns . We are glad to have him back .
492590	3280905	87692	10.0	The Better Version of Stevenson's Classic	While nothing can approach reading the actual novel , this television film version of THE MASTER OF BALLENTRAE is far better than the 1953 film version . At the very least it managed to recreate the real personality problems that appear in that egoist James Durrie . Michael York is shown to be an amoral , selfish human being from the start , when he is carrying on an affair with a poor girl of the local village - an affair that leaves the girl with a child that his family has to help support . York never shows any redeeming quality in his James Durrie . In fact one moment I recall ( which is not in the novel , but should have been ) is when he and his friend Col . Burke ( here Timothy Dalton ) are commenting on requests from the Durrie family to try to economize while they are living in Paris . York smiles and laughs that they will stop drinking so much brandy and only drink champaign from now on . Richard Thomas plays Henry far better than Anthony Steel did . Steel was too young in the role - he never grew into the money obsessed ant to York's spendthrift grasshopper that Thomas could grown into . But the writers watered it down a little , allowing Thomas to be a bit warmer than Henry is in the novel ( and allowing a genuine affection to grow between Thomas and his wife ) . It is a bearable change in the story . Similarly commendable is the worldwide scope of this film version : there are scenes in the novel in the Caribbean , Europe , and India , which are picked up on as we watch James traveling around the world with Burke . The only difference here is that Burke dies in India ( but significantly his death barely fazes his so-called friend James ) . The pirate section in the Caribbean is also changed because the pirate is Blackbeard ( called Captain Teach - Brian Blessed in a nice performance ) . I don't think that Blackbeard would have killed off his own crew as Blessed did , but it was an interesting section of the film . The finale of the novel in the upstate section of the colony of New York maintains the fantastic trick that Stevenson used in the novel - a trick which may be too fantastic . However , it's results are also watered down here , as only one fatality results . With all these alterations the story's bitterness is handled quite well . It certainly is a worthy addition to the films that have appeared based on Stevenson's works in the movies and on television .
493411	3280905	39224	10.0	Hume Cronym's Best Remembered Role Before Old Age	Tonight Turner Classic Films were showing five films in honor of actor writer Hume Cronym ( whose birthday is July 18 ) . Cronym has only been dead now for five years , but he was an impressive character actor in comedy and in drama . I was lucky twenty years ago to see the Broadway production of THE PETITION a two person play Cronym played with his wife and partner Jessica Tandy , and I can vouch he was a crisp and fine a performer on stage as he was in his films . Captain Muncey is one of the most detestable villains in motion pictures , turning his prison into a private torture chamber , with the apparent acquiescence of his guards ( note Ray Teal , his personal guard and assistant ) . He has his way in the prison due to the weakness of the burned out warden Roman Bohman and the bullying of a political hack from the Governor's office ( Richard Gaines ) who is impressed by Muncey's claims of the need for discipline . But as the wise but alcoholic doctor ( Art Smith ) points out , while discipline has a place the Warden has never given an order to Muncey telling him to crucify the prisoners . It's a rather pitiful prison system we see here , and sad to say it remains a problem . The warden keeps bemoaning his failure to come to grips with rehabilitation and punishment , but he has no real suggestions in him , and he is really more upset about what he will do when he is forced out for the rest of his life . The doctor tries to give a degree of humanity to the prisoners lives ( interestingly enough , like the alcoholic doctor played by Dudley Digges in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY ) , but he is aware that he has no place to work outside the prison he is in either . Muncey , in fact , taunts him as a surgical butcher , suggesting something he did went terribly wrong . Muncey and his guards seem to fall into dominating and assaulting the prisoners at the drop of a hat . When Whit Bissell is walked into accidentally by Cronym in the lunchroom , Teal starts clubbing him until even Cronym points out it was his own fault not Bissell's . Only at one late point in the film , when Cronym is beating up Sam Levene in his locked office , do we see some of the guards react - but none intervene . The film ( well directed by noir specialist Jules Dassin ) follows the last week of Cronym's system before it collapses . There have been increasing numbers of prisoners dying because Cronym has purposely put them into unsanitary and deadly work , especially in the main drains of the prison . One prisoner , Burt Lancaster , has refused to crack so far ( he has been put in solitary due to a " shiv " being planted on him , with the connivance of Cronym and Teal ) . He returns to his cell and the prisoner who was the collaborator on this is killed later on in a stunningly good scene in the prison workshop . Lancaster is determined to escape and learns from a dying prisoner that there is a route through the drain . It has to be used in a timed escape that requires a riot in the prison yard and the use of an armed truck . To coordinate Lancaster need the help of the prison trustee ( Charles Bickford ) , but the latter is up for parole . Lancaster plans the escape with his cell mates ( Howard Duff - in his first film , John Hoyt , Whit Bissell , Jack Overman , and Jeff Corey ) . In the course of their discussions they each tell stories about their lives , showing that the economic forces of the world frequently force them into crime ( Bissell embezzles to help him and his wife ; Duff takes the blame for a murder his wife - Yvonne De Carlo - committed to help him when he was being arrested for giving food to the Italians in the war ; Hoyt , a colorful confidence man , is robbed with his own gun of the proceeds of a swindle and a visit to the gambling tables by an attractive woman who also steals his car ; Lancaster has been keeping his crippled , cancer ridden wife ( Ann Blythe ) from knowing he is a criminal and prisoner ) . One gets a feeling that these men did not have to become criminals but were forced into it . This is the weakness of the film , forgetting how many criminals in prison deserve to be in prison for their actions . As was pointed out in another review on this thread , there are sexual criminals who we never see , and the ones sentenced to death ( the film is set in 1947 ) are never even mentioned . Nor are problems among male or female prisoners in their own prisons dealing with sexual predators among their fellow prisoners ( and the guards sometimes ) . However , one can safely say that no prisoner deserves a set of guards controlled by an ego-maniacal sadist like Cronym's Muncey . The film was shot shortly after World War II , so it is notable that Muncey likes to play Wagnerian music ( so long established as music for Nazis ) in his office . In fact , when he beats Sam Levene in his office he has the Wagner music playing loudly to drown Levene's screams ( oddly enough the music is not from the " RING " Cycle , but from TANNHAUSER , and it is the " Venusburg " music which was supposed to be sensual ! ) . Still the film shows the cruel , power-mad Captain as an unforgettable villain . He is as aware at the end of Lancaster's plans as he can be - but he is also aware of the warning Art Smith gives him - that power mad people end up being destroyed by their power . In his last few moments ( as one sees in the film ) Captain Muncey does find out how true this comment is .
491834	3280905	151568	10.0	Their Masterpiece Operetta	In 1884 William Schwenk Gilbert came up with the idea for a new operetta which he took to his partners Richard D'Oyly Carte and Sir Arthur Sullivan . It was about a lozenge or a drink which if taken could change the party digesting it into any person he or she wanted . Gilbert had ideas about how to develop this idea into a full story , but as he outlined the idea he was told by his partners it would not do . His only alternative was his first " medieval " Savoy Opera . In 1882 Lord Tennyson had created a verse play called THE PRINCESS . It , like all Tennyson's plays , was politely successful because of their creator's popularity . Like his fellow poet , Robert Browning , Tennyson was a good poet but a third - rate dramatist . THE PRINCESS dealt with a princess running a school only for women . Gilbert , no feminist , saw some possibilities for a spoof . So he created PRINCESS IDA , taking Tennyson's basic work and twisting it into a satire on education , feminism , and medieval romances . There would even be a dig at Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory in the song " The Lady and the Ape " . In retrospect it looks odd that Sullivan and Carte accepted it - it was a two act operetta with a prelude ( today it is known as the only three act Savoy Opera ) . Reading it , even with allowance for predominant views of women in 1884 , it is hard to understand why they felt it was suitable or would be popular . My guess is that the medieval background appealed to Sullivan's desire for a grand opera work . PRINCESS IDA ran about eight months . Given that from 1877 to 1884 the average Savoy work ran a year and then some , this was a flop ( it remains something of a flop even now - revivals of PRINCESS IDA are less likely than any of the completed operettas except for THE SORCEROR , UTOPIA LTD . , and THE GRAND DUKE ) . Sullivan actually was better in doing his share in this work than Gilbert was than in any other of their works but THE GRAND DUKE - Gilbert's heart really wasn't in PRINCESS IDA . As a result of this , and Sullivan's knighthood that year , Gilbert was in a weak position . His first offer was to let Sullivan do an operetta with another writer ( Bret Harte was mentioned , interestingly enough ) . Then he offered the lozenge plot . Sullivan refused it again . He wanted a plot with real people and real situations . Actually that Sullivan said this at all shows how little he ever understood of his partner . Gilbert was not a realist , but went to town spoofing logic . At the behest of his wife , Gilbert went to Knightsbridge , where a model Japanese village was exhibited . He found it fascinating , even buying a Japanese ceremonial sword as a souvenir . It was hanging on a wall in his study , where Gilbert was racking his brains for a new idea , when it fell . Gilbert walked to it , picked it up , and began thinking . And theatrical history was made as a result . TOPSY-TURVEY follows the story of how Gilbert presented Sullivan and Carte with their greatest work , THE MIKADO , or THE TOWN OF TITIPOO ( to give it it's complete title ) . It gives more details of the lifestyles and problems of both men ( Gilbert's poisonous relationship with his mother ; his failure to have children with his wife ; Sullivan's relationship with Mrs . Ronalds - his American born lover ) . It looks more deeply into the lives and problems of Jessie Bond , George Grossmith , Rutland Barrignton , Richard Temple , and the other members of the cast and orchestra . As such it is more detailed than THE GREAT GILBERT AND SULLIVAN was , but it only concentrates on the year 1884 to 85 . While all the performances are on target , and touching in their ways , Jim Broadbent as the stern but reliable dramatist gave his first film performance of international stature . He captures the lack of nonsense in the everyday Gilbert , the thorough craftsman of plays and productions standards ( watch him when he rehearses Grossmith and the others - he fully knows the effects he wants ) . He missed out the Oscar that he was nominated for in 1999 , but would get one a few years after for IRIS . His reputation is firmly established now . Oh , about the lozenge plot . Over the years after 1885 Gilbert brought it up again and again in 1887 , 1888 , 1889 . Each time he was shouted down . When the partners went their separate ways briefly after THE GONDELIERS , in 1890 , Gilbert approached Alfred Cellier with the idea . Cellier said yes . Sullivan finally produced his opera , IVANHOE at this time . It ran for four months , and then fell into oblivion . Gilbert and Cellier's THE MOUNTEBANKS ran for about as long as PRINCESS IDA did , and since it was not a Gilbert and Sullivan work that was terrific . It can be revived on occasion . Gilbert had been right about the lozenge plot after all .
492326	3280905	70364	10.0	A Classic Novella about American Patriotism	In 1863 Abraham Lincoln was plagued by a growing peace movement led by political opponents who said the war was a failure , and we should recognize the Confedrate States under Jefferson Davis . The leading spokesperson for " Copperheads " was one Clement Vallandigham , an Ohio Congressman who was a gifted public orator . Vallandigham was giving anti-Union speeches in Ohio . Lincoln did not know what do to shut up this dangerous radical . And then Major General Ambrose E . Burnside , commander of the Department of the Ohio , stepped in . Burnside had his flaws - his list of disasters on the battlefield included his " masterpiece " at Fredericksburg , Va . But he was a real patriot , and hearing Vallandigham's speeches got the better of him . He arrested the Congressman for treason . Lincoln now had a potential time bomb - if he put Vallandigham on trial and he was convicted , the Copperhead would become a martyr . If he put Vallandigham on trial , and he was acquitted it would be worse . Vallandigham made comments in his speeches about how sick he was about living in the North as it was , and how he hated being a present day citizen of the U . S . A . Suddenly Lincoln got an idea . Smiling , he sent Burnside an order that as Clement Vallandigham had openly said he hated being a citizen of the U . S . A . , his wish should be granted . Smiling in his turn , Amborse Burnside arranged ( as Lincoln ordered ) for Vallandigham to be taken by a heavy guard to the border of Ohio and Ontario , and sent across the border into the British Colony ( Canada was still British North America in 1863 ) . Vallandigham lived in Toronto ( a center of Canadian secret activity during the war ) until late 1864 , when he returned to the North in disguise . Once he revealed himself publicly again , nobody bothered him . Edward Everett Hale was a prominent magazine writer of the period . Today THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY is his acknowledged masterpiece , but he also wrote THE BRICK MOON , an early science fiction novella about an artificial satellite that may have influenced Jules Verne's novel THE BEGUM'S FORTUNE . Hale wrote THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY in response to the Vallandigham business , setting it back two generations to the controversy about Aaron Burr's Western " Empire " schemes . But this book was like Tom Paine's COMMON SENSE - a small book that hit the public at just the right moment in a war ( Elbert Hubbard's A MESSAGE TO GARCIA is another example of this ) and swept the country , ending up a permanent piece of American literature . ( If you check this web site under the proper names , you will find that Edward Everett Hale did his little bit to assist American film comedy : he is the grand father and namesake of that terrific comic character actor Edward Everett Horton . ) Lt . Philip Nolan is an ambitious naval officer in the early American navy of the John Adams and Thomas Jefferson era ( 1798 - 1807 ) . He is sent to a western outpost in Louisiana , and is bored there . When Burr shows up he gets heavily involved in Burr's schemes . When Burr falls , Nolan is arrested and tried for treason . In a moment of anger , Nolan makes the mistake of shouting in court that he wishes he never heard the name of the United States of America again . The court-martial board are shocked by this statement . After getting proper instructions from President Jefferson ( like Burnside would from Lincoln in 1863 ) they agree to Nolan's request . He is put on one American frigate after another for the rest of his life . While on board the ship takes down it's American flags . Nobody is to mention the U . S . A . or news from the states in his presence . For the next half-century Nolan is treated like this . He actually turns out to be far more aware of his idiotic comment than anyone realizes ( at a dance he is pointedly reminded about it by a pretty American socialite he meets ) . He even assists in winning a battle in the War of 1812 against the enemy British ship . But the decision of the court is upheld until he dies . Yet , at the tale's end , it turns out that Nolan did learn what happened , and even knew of most of the new states in the union . The narrator ( as Nolan is dying ) tells him the history of the U . S . since 1807 . Except for one point : he can't bring himself to reveal that in 1863 there is a Civil War going on , and that half the states no longer want to be part of the U . S . A . Still Nolan dies happy , having been reassured of his nations ' expansion and seeming prosperity . This 1973 version was quite good , with Cliff Robinson as Nolan , developing from a " Hotspur " young man into a maturer type who gradually realizes what a stupid wish he voiced . Robinson was a bit too old to be the young Philip Nolan , but he handled the later years all right . Beau Bridges is the narrator , who crosses Nolan's path in his own naval career . Robert Ryan , in one of his last performances , plays the wise older officer who fills in some of Nolan's history to Bridges , and explains why the Navy Department just doesn't stop the long exile : " Have you ever tried to fight the white tape of Washington City ? " , Ryan says with a friendly smile to Bridges . Twenty years later , when running across Nolan again , Bridges remembers Ryan's statement again . Quite different from Ryan's other nautical figure from this period : Claggart in BILLY BUDD . A worthy , and moving version of the great novella - it reached Hale's goal very well .
492421	3280905	76095	10.0	Another successful Simon " Odd Couple " story	Neil Simon is consistent . He loves to use and reuse the " ODD COUPLE " plot with variations in one play or another : in the original ODD COUPLE , it's female version ( shown in the early 1990s ) , the sequel film with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon , the play ( and movie ) THE SUNSHINE BOYS - where the apartment is a lifelong comedy team partnership , and this one . Here it is Marcia Mason and her daughter , Quinn Cummings , who are always being deserted by Mason's husband or her series of boy-friends who usually are actors . Mason has become determined never again to trust or date an actor . But the apartment happens to be in the name of her last boyfriend , and he has made a subletting deal with out-of-town actor Richard Dreyfus . Dreyfus is determined to stay in the apartment while in New York ( he is starring in a production within the city - off Broadway ) . He and Mason gradually agree to cease their hostilities and to share the apartment , but Mason finds Dreyfus weird : he is only eating special food , and he chants and plays the guitar at night . On the other hand Quinn Cummings finds he's not such a bad guy ( he helps her when she has a headache , relaxing her to sleep ) . The play that Dreyfus is appearing in the lead role in is Shakespeare's RICHARD III . It is being produced by Paul Benedict ( a rare big part for that good comic actor ) , but his ideas about the production are upsetting Dreyfus . Dreyfus is approaching the role in the classical , " Olivier " form - the master , evil Machiavellian monarch . Machiavellian to be sure in Benedict's version , but also gay . As Benedict pushes it , it is the story of " the Queen who would be King " . Dreyfus's performance of the play within the film , following Benedict's direction , is an everlasting comic joy . The highs and lows of the two warring suite mates follows a romantic course , as they gradually fall in love with each other . Will this actor prove to be another one of those typically selfish actors that Mason resents , or will he prove to be different to her and Cummings - will he be the real love of her life ? A first rate comedy , and Dreyfus ' Oscar - a well earned one .
492378	3280905	27698	10.0	Damn Good for a Film Biography of a Theatrical Giant	I suspect that had Dashiell Hammett never written a successful comic pot boiler detective story called THE THIN MAN , William Powell's best remembered role would be as Florenz Ziegfeld in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD . Here he captured that brilliant showman's vision and drive with just the right degree of sophistication . I can't think of few others - maybe Robert Montgomery , but I sadly doubt it ( he seems too young ) - who could have done as first rate a job . It is really rare for a theatrical presence to maintain himself or herself decades or centuries after their death . Prior to the invention of motion pictures it was impossible ( except for the late 19th Century crowd , starting with Edwin Booth , Sir Henry Irving , and Ellen Terry - they had some phonograph recordings ) for actors to preserve their personas . Photo stills helped but did not leave much . Occasionally one would " accomplish " something for good or ill that people would recall ( i . e . , John Wilkes Booth ) , but that was a rarity . Movies changed that by allowing the audience to stretch from the contemporaries to the future ones . There are actual movies of Flo Ziegfeld at work on Broadway . Unfortunately he did not look like Bill Powell ( Flo was somewhat fat ) , but those surviving newsreels showed his energy with his casts and productions . Powell got that side of him right . THE GREAT ZIEGFELD traces the showman from his start as the publicity manager of Eugene Sandow ( Nat Pendleton ) from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 to his rise as a major Broadway impresario from 1900 until 1930 . Only the Great Depression destroyed Ziegfeld's career ( he lost most of his fortune in the crash ) . Significantly his fall is showed by the lights of his four currently big shows ( including SHOWBOAT , RIO RITA , and THE THREE MUSKETEERS ) all fading out one after another . It not only destroyed his career , but it helped kill the poor fellow ( he died in 1932 ) . But by that point his historical reputation was established by his series of spectacular Broadway " Follies " shows with the likes of Ed Wynn , Fanny Brice , W . C . Fields , Will Rogers , Bert Williams , Walter Catlett , Leon Erroll as the comic leads , and music by such composers as Jerome Kern , Victor Herbert , Irving Berlin , and even the Gershwins . But better was Ziegfeld's use of women - his " Glorifying the American Girl " reviews did precisely that , affecting taste in theater spectacles and taste in what beauty in women should be . He had his rivals as pointed out in other reviews here . Among them were the Shuberts , possibly the most successful in the long run ( but only because there were several of them , and they did not go bankrupt ) . Earl Carroll did produce his " Vanities " , and George White did do the " Scandals " , but in retrospect ( for all the talent they brought to their shows ) these were pale imitations . In Carroll's case he skirted the level of decency by suggesting his chorus girls were naked in some of the sketches . Ziegfeld was no saint but he knew what was acceptable behavior in theatrical production on stage . This film had a good cast . Besides Powell , the women in his life ( Anna Held , his chorus girl girlfriend , and Billie Burke ) are played well by Louise Rainer , Virginia Bruce , and Powell's movie " wife " Myrna Loy . Rainer ( as the betrayed Anna ) got her first " Oscar " for this role , most likely for the emotional " telephone " scene . Her part is actually a substantial one , but due to the size of this film it has always been seen as a short supporting bit . This is a trifle unfair . Virginia Bruce brings a nice calculating eye to her performance , undermining the Ziegfeld - Held relationship , but slowly losing the showman due to her increasing alcoholism . Loy was really lucky . Once she got the role she contacted the living and active Billie Burke and had discussions about how to accurately portray the second Mrs . Ziegfeld . She wisely does not try to imitate Billie's familiar syrupy upper register voice . Frank Morgan appears as a friendly rival or Ziegfeld's , both in business and in the boudoir . One likes him as one usually likes Morgan's comic characters . My favorite performance is that of Fanny Brice playing herself . The film was made the year after the death of Will Rogers so that he was not around ( he possibly could have been borrowed ) . Fields was out - Ziegfeld had had plenty of trouble with that curmudgeon on Broadway , and MGM probably knew that Fields would have demanded equal billing to Powell . Wynn was mostly still on Broadway . One does wish Catlett and Erroll might have been used . But we have Fanny in her glory , culminating in her singing her most famous number - " My Man " . That alone is worth watching the film for . As for the showcase production number on the spiraling tower , it is quite impressive ( I doubt if Ziegfeld could have put it on the stage of his New Amsterdam Theater ) , but I agree that the dubbing of Dennis Morgan's voice by Allan Jones is totally inexplicable to this day .
493377	3280905	27800	10.0	A Hodgepodge Science Fiction - Horror Film That Works Well	Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi made many films together , but on the whole ( interestingly enough ) Karloff usually is the better man of the two . The real exception is " The Black Cat " ( 1934 ) where Karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult , and Lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life . But more usual is " Black Friday " , where ( whatever his motive ) Karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while Lugosi is a murderous thug . In " The Raven " Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon , who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough . Rarely are they both negative characters totally . In " The Body Snatcher " , Karloff does kill Lugosi , but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him . The one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film , which I feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies I have mentioned . In it Karloff's Dr . Janos Rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the " official scientific community " for his theory that a rare form of Radium is in Nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago . He has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens ( Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi ) , and has another scientist , a Frenchman named Dr . Felix Benet ( Lugosi ) , Rukh's young wife Diane ( Frances Drake ) and a friend and protégée of the Stevenses named Ronald Drake ( Frank Lawton ) . Before they leave , Rukh is warned by his mother ( Violet Kemble Cooper ) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy . He tries to dismiss this , but he is worried by what she says , his scientific standing , and whether or not he is going to get his due credit . What he gets is a disaster . He finds the substance , but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity . He finds that he is slowly burning up , and if he tries to touch people or animals they die . He's actually built up a friendship or understanding with Benet , who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for Rukh to use to counter the danger . But there are two things that are unbeatable here . The antidote can only last for a certain amount of time , and has to be replenished . And the radioactivity has affected Rukh's brain . He is increasingly jealous of Diane's friendship with Ronald ( encouraged , unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella ) , and he is equally upset that ( due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that ) Benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that " Radium X " is giving to man . Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives , ending with his own . The film certainly picked up on science to an extent . Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium . Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 , but some idea of it was coming out . The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a " curse " on the expedition . Of course , with the idea of a " cursed " expedition ( on the continent of Africa ) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago , financed by a titled Englishman , we have entered archeology not physics or geology ( paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon ) . On the other hand , Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths , and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England . During the Whitechapel Murders , Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper . It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes . But the idea did not die . Jules Verne used it in his novel " The Brothers Kip " in 1899 , and here Dr . Benet uses it . As this is a science fiction story , he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate , but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters . The film is good on many grounds , the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other . There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films . The other performances are good as well , in particular Ms Kemble Cooper . She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone's frightening sister ( Jane Murdstone ) in " David Copperfield " . Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end , and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target .
492346	3280905	29992	10.0	" Mankind was my business ! "	Although I favor the versions of this story with Alistair Sim or with George C . Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge ( and I have not had the luck to see the surviving version with Sir Seymour Hicks ) , I like this one too . It gave an opportunity ( a rare one ) to one of Hollywood's best character actors to have the central role in a film for a change . The only other film with Reginald Owen as the star is ( interestingly enough ) when he played Sherlock Holmes in " A Study In Scarlet " earlier in the 1930s . Owen was good in an inferior film ( certainly a bad retelling of that novel ) . Owen was usually good though , be he playing comic parts ( see him in " Petticoat Fever " ) , or in dramatic parts ( his vicious and opportunistic Alaskan prospector / thief in the 1935 " Call Of The Wild " ) . He had a long career too , even playing a " Commidore Schmidlapp " in the film version of " Batman " with Adam West and Burt Ward in the late 1960s . If Sim made Scrooge a neurotic , and Scott an opportunistic stock jobber , and Albert Finney a nasty , people-hating usurer , Scrooge is a tight fisted businessman who never looses anything . He knows how much is spent in his premises ( note how Owen , as he enters the offices , senses too much heat and glares at the fireplace , while poor Bob Cratchit ( Gene Lockhart ) scurries over to take out those two valuable pieces of coal he momentarily added ) . He is also constantly saving everything : His nephew Fred ( Barry Mackay ) brought a bottle of port wine to the office that he gave to Bob , who took a drink . After Crachit leaves , Owen is about to throw out the bottle , realizes that it has been barely touched , and takes it home with him . Later he will take some cough medicine at home , and after doing so he will lick his fingers as not to lose any drops of the medicine . He also disgusts a waiter ( Henry Cording ) who has just served him a cheap meal when he insists on biting a coin to see if it is good . The versions of " A Christmas Carol " always pick and choose items to develop from the story or to drop . They all stick to the main trajectory ( introduce Scrooge and the Cratchits and Fred and his fiancé , Scrooge goes home and is visited by Marley and the ghosts , Scrooge sees his past - usually the public school and his sister's visit , and the Fezziwigs dance party - then sees his present - the Cratchits and Fred with their family and friends - and then sees the possible future - the death of Tiny Tim ( Terry Kilbride in this film ) and Scrooge's unlamented death ; the trajectory is completed by some version of Scrooge's reformation bearing Christmas joy to all who he formerly denied it too . It's pick and choose . The section with the Ghost of Christmas Past ( Anne Rutherford ) ends before we see Scrooge's descent into pure greed and selfishness ( and there is no reference to his love affair with Fezziwig's daughter ) . The section with the Ghost of Christmas Present ( Lionel Braham ) shows the ghost settling some trivial street quarrels with his horn of Christmas " cheer " , and he does get in the jab about " Tiny Tim " should die to decrease the surplus population ( a reference to Scrooge's earlier thoughtless comment ) . But he does not show the two waifs that under his robe representing " want " and " fear " . The ghost of Christmas to Come remains silent . . . as the tomb ( as Dickens wanted him to be . [ Only once , when Disney did a version with " Scrooge McDuck " ( Alan Young ) in a cartoon did the third ghost speak . It turned out to be the old Disney villain , Pegleg Pete , and he gleefully pushes McDuck into the grave after telling him off . ] The additions here include a running series of scenes concerning ice sliding that involves the street urchins , Fred and his fiancé , and even the local Minister ( Halliwell Hobbs ) . Also Crachitt loses his job here when he accidentally selects Scrooge for the target of his snowball . ( Scrooge charges him the whole of his last week's pay , and an additional shilling for the cost of a new hat ) . The film tries to keep the design in line with the illustrations by Cruikshank ( Fezziwig even has an 18th Century wig on ) . Owen does reawaken as he recalls the joys he's pushed aside and sacrificed . His make-up here resembles a little his villain from the 1936 " Trouble For Two " , who was also nearly completely bald . Lockhart adds troubled tension to his role , knowing he will only have one week of work left ( unpaid ! ) after this . It's nice to see that here one of Cratchit's children is played by Lockhart's real life daughter June . All in all a delightful version , if somehow not as meaty as the others that I like .
493154	3280905	35703	10.0	Taking a Chance On Love	Let's call it a deserved " 10 " but with a sense of trouble for one's conscience . In 1943 it was nearly impossible to consider any film with a predominantly African-American cast as serious by most Americans of Caucasian or non-African-American backgrounds . Typical fare from Hollywood was a series of stereotypes , usually for comic purposes . However there had been a few films that ( even with the stereotypes ) suggested more was there . King Vidor's HALLELUJAH in 1929 dealt with African-American revivalism . Two Broadway hits , O'Neill's THE EMPEROR JONES ( with star Paul Robeson recreating the role of Brutus Jones ) and THE GREEN PASTURES had been done with mostly African-American casts ( Dudley Digges did play a critically important role in THE EMPEROR JONES , but he was an exception ) . The 1929 and 1936 versions of SHOW BOAT did deal with the " Jim Crow " south , and the issue of racially mixed marriages . The film of Fanny Hurst's novel IMITATION OF LIFE ( 1933 ) dealt with a young woman trying to pass for white and breaking her mother's heart as a result . GONE WITH THE WIND passed on the myths of how happy the slaves were in the South , but Hattie McDaniel's performance of " Mammy " was vivid and strong , and won the first Oscar for an African-American performer . Finally , in 1942 , John Huston's film , IN THIS OUR LIFE , dared to suggest that a young African-American man could try to study law to enter the legal profession . When Vincent Minelli was assigned to do the MGM musical version of CABIN IN THE SKY , most insiders thought that it would be a flop . Minelli had never directed a film before , and was an unknown quantity in Hollywood's talent market . Actually he was a good choice - he was a veteran of Broadway musical productions , and was just the right person to work on a film based on a Broadway musical . It was his first film , and proved to be a great success . It think it is due in part to his determination to show what he could bring out of the musical , and also the equal determination of the cast , led by Ethel Waters ( who played the lead " Petunia " on Broadway ) , Eddie Anderson ( " Joe " ) , Lena Horne ( as temptress " Georgia Brown " ) , John Bubbles ( " Domino Johnson " ) , Kenneth Spencer ( " The General / Rev . Greene " ) , and Rex Ingram ( " Lucifer Jr . " ) . Other familiar faces crop up like Willie Best , Mantan Morland , Oscar Polk , Butterfly McQueen , Louis Armstrong ( oddly wasted in a mostly comic speaking role ) , and Duke Ellington and his orchestra . It's hard to imagine this but this film effort had the cream of Hollywood's available African-American performers in it . And they wanted to show what they could do . The story is about the devotion of Petunia to her husband Little Joe , who is weak and constantly gambling . But he hopes to win a fortune to give Petunia the things she always wanted . Unfortunately he is also infatuated with Georgia , a sexy singer at the gambling house / night club he heads for . One night ( while supposedly seeking forgiveness for his sins at church ) Joe is lured to the nightclub into a dice game , and is shot by Domino . He is treated at home and the film goes from this point to it's conclusion with a battle between God's messenger , " the General " ( always wearing white uniforms ) , and " Lucifer Jr . " and his minions . Due to a technicality Joe is not to die , but is given six months more to show his wife's devotion is strong enough to put him permanently on the good and narrow path . Lucifer Jr . and his associates ( including Morland , Armstrong , and Best ) are determined to show Joe cannot change . The cast shows what they could do . Waters in particular has two songs that became standards : " Happiness is a Guy named Joe " , by Harold Arlin and Y . I . P . Harburg , and " Taking a Chance On Love " by Vernon Duke from the original score . But Horne is allowed to sing as well ( though one number was cut here but transposed elsewhere ) . Bubbles does his great dance and song act in the latter part of the film , in the number " Shine " . Even Anderson ( best recalled for being Jack Benny's foil as " Rochester " ) demonstrates singing in a duet with Horne , and dance in a number with Waters . I suppose my favorite though is Ingram . He's now the forgotten man in African-American film history , because he never had the degree of public attention that Paul Robeson received . But he appeared in the lead as " De Lawd " in the movie version of THE GREEN PASTURES , as " Lucifer Jr . " here , as the genie in the Alexander Korda epic THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD ( 1941 ) , and graced other films as well ( as the gentle valet to Ronald Colman in THE TALK OF THE TOWN , where he starts crying at his boss's insistence at shaving off his distinguished goatee ) . Ingram , I feel , could play any kind of part . Given the paucity of good lead parts in his day , that he got three of them shows Hollywood and British producers thought well of him . Here he does not sing ( I suspect he did not have the voice ) but he is enjoying his wickedness throughout . He also has one of the best lines in the film - complaining of the lack of good ideas ( in getting Joe's soul ) : he says that it's because the best idea men in Hell are currently in Europe ( this being the fourth year of World War II ) . The film is actually quite entertaining to this day - although the stereotypes of crap shooting African-Americans is unsettling . But think of this point : this is the first film I know of from Hollywood where a black professional is shown who is not a minister ! When Eddie Anderson is treated for his gunshot wound , the physician is black , and is not a stereotype .
493390	3280905	33740	10.0	Smart Cop Gone Berserk	Laird Cregar's performances in motion pictures were small in number ( a bit over twenty films ) , but large in ability to hold audience attention and in sheer artistry . Whether Jack The Ripper , George Bone , Clive Oxford , Willard Gates , Sir Henry Morgan , or whoever , Cregar dominates his films , and usually each performance is unique in itself . He is usually considered a movie villain . It's true that violence plays a heavy part in his films , but his " Lodger " is driven mad by sorrow at the loss of his talented brother due to a prostitute ; his Gates is in over his head , due to the demands of his evil boss ( Tully Marshall ) and the target of his actions ( a deadly Alan Ladd ) ; his Bone is suffering from a mental disease , but trying to compose the concerto that will give him immortality . In short , most of his villains have something in their background that makes them pitiful if frightening . Occasionally he plays a run-of-the-mill lowlife . In BLOOD AND SAND , his bullfighting critic " Curo " ( which means a Bull's rectum ) is a self-important parasite on bullfighters like J . Carroll Naish and Tyrone Power , whom he builds up , lives off of , and then throws aside when they no longer make large salaries . But in his catalog of roles , possibly his most frightening one is his New York City master police inspector Ed Cornell . Not in fancy clothes or make-up , Cornell is mostly fierce attention and an ever-parked fedora hat on his head . He is the perfect realization of ability , brains , and retribution . For Ed Cornell misuses his badge to destroy promoter Frankie Christopher ( Victor Mature ) . In playing the ultimately dangerous cop , Cregar actually played the scariest villain in his career ( even more frightening in his way than " the Lodger " or Bone ) . Vicki Lynn ( Carole Landis ) was a promising model whose career was being pushed by Christopher . Mature plays Christopher realistically - a friendly but pushy type who is a wire puller through his contacts , like actor Robin Ray ( Alan Mowbray ) and Larry Evans ( Allyn Joslyn ) . Christopher hoped to get Lynn into acting and a fancier career . But she is found murdered . Circumstances are not settled in any direction , but when Cornell enters the case , and starts examining Christopher , he starts making veiled insinuations about the latter's actions and motives and activities on the night of the murder - insinuations that suggest a remarkably subtle detective intelligence - but also an inexplicable hostility . It soon becomes evident that Cornell is not simply trying to solve a murder . He is trying to definitely prove Christopher is guilty - or is he trying to frame Christopher ? Ed Cornell is Cregar's model ( unwittingly and unintentionally ) for Orson Welles ' later Hank Quinlan . Both men are incredibly adept at their work , but both become incredibly corrupt at it . Quinlan's corruption carries on too long and too far . Cornell's , as we learn , is concentrated on this case - but it goes far enough to establish his own evil as memorable . Being Cregar he varies his menace towards Mature with some lighter moments . Please note the intellectual story about the rare butterflies that he mentions when talking to his superior about laying a trap . He does show a human side eventually as well . But it is the evil that he does that dominates in this film , making it one of the first great film noir of the 1940s .
493391	3280905	29870	10.0	Cagney's First Screen Award Performance	The rise and fall of Rocky Sullivan , tough guy gangster but square fellow , was the subject of this excellent film by Warner Brothers in 1938 . It has several things going for it that maintains it's high ratings among gangster films and Cagney movies . For one thing , Cagney's brilliant performance as Rocky won him his first major film award - the 1938 New York Film Critics Award for best actor . It is frequently forgotten that Cagney won this award four years before his Oscar winner in " Yankee Doodle Dandy " , but in actuality the performance was the high point of the work he did ( up to that time ) as a gangster ( his performances in " White Heat " and " Love Me Or Leave Me " were way in the future ) . It drives home how much of a struggle it was for Cagney to get out of the gangster mode , and why his George M . Cohan was such a striking change for his fans . Secondly it was the sequel ( the first sequel ) of the Bowery Boy feature films after their introduction in " Dead End " . Oddly enough , in that film , Humphrey Bogart was the out and out gangster " Baby Face " Martin , who was the villain in the film . Baby Face enjoyed his following with the gang of boys in that film . Here , though , Bogart was playing a weaselly lawyer named Jim Frazier , who is cowardly - quite a different type from Baby Face , who is angry at the state of his world and how ugly it has become . But Baby Face , at least , had guts . The Bowery Boys are again a gang of street kids , who Father Jerry Connelly ( Pat O'Brien ) is trying to keep on the straight and narrow . Here , however , they worship Rocky , the local punk who did rise in the underworld and made a name for himself . But Rocky is Jerry's oldest friend , and he is also willing to help the priest with the boys . The story deals with how Bogart and his new boss , Mac Keefer ( the unjustly forgotten George Bancroft ) have gotten control of over 100 , 000 dollars ( 1930 style dollars - about twenty million in buying power today ) , that belongs to Cagney . Cagney wants it back , and when Bogart and Bancroft keep putting him off he uses strong arm methods to force them into line . Eventually things blow up , and Cagney ends up in a gun battle that leaves a dead cop . He is tried and found guilty for this murder , and goes to the death house . This leads to one of the most frightening moments in Cagney's film career - when we see his final moments when being taken to the electric chair to be strapped in . I guarantee once seen you will never forget it . There are one or two interesting points of a historical nature about Cagney's performance as Rocky . First , that massive gun battle that is shown ( where he kills the cop and battles the police department from a building . It actually happened ! In about 1931 there was an incident in Manhattan when a young hood , " Two Gun " Crowley , held off police after a homicide in a battle that lasted nearly an entire afternoon . Crowley ( like Rocky ) was defeated by tear gas . Like Rocky , he too died in the electric chair . It has been pointed out that Cagney based some of Rocky's mannerisms on a drug addict character he knew in his old Hell's Gate / Yorkville area when he was a kid . Cagney mentions this in his memoir CAGNEY . But there is a curious second source . In his youth , Jimmy Cagney came from a family that struggled but managed to have food on the table and clothes on their back . But some of his playmates were not so lucky . One was a fellow nicknamed " Bootah " ( because of the oversize boots he was forced to wear ) whose real name was Peter Heslin . Cagney always was friendly with Peter , but their lives drifted apart . On April 5 , 1926 , Heslin was engaged in an armed robbery when an off-duty police officer , Charles H . Reilly , tried to stop him and was shot and killed . But Heslin ( who was also wounded in the encounter ) was captured shortly afterward . He was tried and convicted , and finally executed on July 21 , 1927 . That same night , a star was born on Broadway where Jimmy Cagney made a name for himself as a singer and dancer in the show " Broadway " . Cagney was aware of the tragedy playing out with his friend at Sing Sing that night . He mentions Bootah's execution in his memoirs . Newspaper accounts of Heslin's electrocution do not mention anything unusual , but one wonders if ( when Cagney was doing the scene ) he thought of his unfortunate friend and added a bit more power to those last moments of the film .

Both remind each other of a happier world : that of Paris where both grew up ( ironically in nearby neighborhoods ) . They really discover each other talking about Metro stations in Paris ' subway . And both realize that with each other they might be free again . But can they get together ? It is a marvelous film . Pepi does have a girl ( Ines ) who is trying to awaken in him her own passions , but finds first she is battling his desire to return to France , and then he is pursuing Gaby . There are also the members of Pepi's gang , who are his eyes into the goings on in the city outside his sanctuary . And there are dangers in the sanctuary : traitors like Regis who can be deadly in their activities . In the end we are never bored by this film . It was ( with MAYERLING ) the film that introduced Charles Boyer to movie audiences as a great film lover ( and here a sad one ) . It was also the film that re-enforced stardom on Hedy Lamar after ECSTASY . Sigried Lurie's Ines is intensely tragic , and Gene Lockhart properly sleazy as Regis ( and his final scene very satisfactory to the audience ) . As the disagreeable Gireaux , Robert Grieg showed a vicious cynicism his butlers in film comedies rarely showed . But best , in some ways , is Joseph Calleia as the Inspector . Normally playing villains and sleaze-balls , Calleia had a chance here to be on the side of the law , and also to show a sympathetic understanding of Boyer's Pepe . He can tell that the man is hurting for his homeland , and while he is willing to use this to get him out of the Casbah he does respect Pepe's feelings . In the end he regrets his pursuit's conclusion . A very satisfactory conclusion to the film though .
492498	3280905	35575	10.0	He Was the " Yankee Doodle Boy "	Unless you happen to catch a rare showing of THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT , you are not going to see any film that will bring you closer to that long gone Broadway phenomenon named George M . Cohan than this . Producer , Director , Dramatist , Actor , Composer , and super-patriot , he rewrote the American musical theater . If his successful productions are out of date today , the music survives to reawaken us every July 4th ( his big holiday ) . His success as a songwriter led the way to Gershwin , Porter , Rodgers ( and Hart and Hammerstein ) , Kern , and Youmans . YANKEE DOODLE DANDY is not a perfect biography of Cohan - he was still alive while it was being made , and would have vetoed the project mentioning his first failed marriage to Ethel Levey or his opposition to Actor's Equity . But as a valentine to his greatness as an entertainment phenomenon it remains great . Whole numbers from his LITTLE JOHNNY JONES ( " Yankee Doodle Dandy " and " Give My Regards To Broadway " ) and FORTY-FIVE MINUTES FROM Broadway ( " So Long Mary " ) are shown as they were produced . James Cagney ( who was a first rate song and dance man on Broadway ) studied THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT to know what were Cohan's singing and dancing style . His research and work paid off in this , his best musical performance and his only Oscar performance . Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp are splendid as his loving , but long suffering parents ( best scene for both is when Huston has to spank the young Cohan for blowing an important booking chance ) . Huston also has a moving moment when he gets as a birthday gift 50 % of George's business enterprises . Richard Whorf ( who was so sinister that same year in KEEPER OF THE FLAME ) was excellent as partner / friend Sam Harris . Jeanne Cagney is good as Cohan's sister Josie , and Joan Leslie wonderful as Mary Cohan ( the only wife of Cohan in the film , but historically his second wife ) . Also of note are George Tobias and Chester Clute as Dietz and Goff ( poor Goff ) and S . Z . Sakall as a backer who loves chorus girls . Walter Catlett as a conniving theater owner has a funny scene . Irene Manning as Fay Templeton is a perfectly snobbish star who actually finds Cohan has merit . Finally , catch Eddie Foy Jr . as his father , Cohan's rival and closest friend . That scene together was so good that it could have been continued as a short subject comedy . One minor point to bring out - it is mentioned that LITTLE JOHNNY JONES is based on a jockey named Tod Sloane . If you recall Johnny Jones was accused of throwing the English Derby , and he is cleared afterward when papers are found showing one Anskey was responsible . In actuality Sloane , the leading American jockey of the day , was disgraced in a similar situation when riding in the English Derby . In Sloane's case there was no sequel with an " Anskey " and it sent his career into a tailspin . Only in the last year was a biography written about Sloane's tragic fall from sports fame .
493340	3280905	22158	10.0	Zeppo's best Marx Brother Film	Zeppo Marx is frequently considered with a trace of a sneer : the fourth brother who was not worthy of membership in one of filmdom's two best comedy teams . He was the fourth brother of Groucho , Chico , & Harpo Marx ( and is only slightly better remembered than fifth brother Gummo , who never appeared in any of their films ) . He looked the best of the brothers ( he was the youngest ) so he could play the romantic lead if nobody else had the role ( like Oscar Shaw did in COCONUTS ) . However although his appearance was better than the other three brothers , he was not a really handsome man like Robert Taylor or Tyrone Power . Also he had a serious problem with his sense of humor - he had one but it was remarkably similar to Groucho's . In fact , during the Broadway run of COCONUTS , Groucho was ordered by a doctor to take a long , overdue rest . He took off for two weeks , and was replaced by understudy Zeppo . At the end of two weeks he talked to the producers , and they willingly allowed him to take an additional week off . In fact , when that was finished they said he could take more time off if needed . They were not in a rush to get him back . Suspicious , Groucho went unannounced to the theater one night , and watched Zeppo being so good the audience was laughing hysterically at his delivery and acting . In a single day Groucho returned to the show . Groucho never made that mistake again . It would have been impossible for Zeppo to have played a smaller version of Groucho on screen . There would have been an imbalance with two Grouchos in the films . So Zeppo was usually put into the films as Groucho's assistant , or secretary , or even his son ( in HORSE FEATHERS ) . His part in COCONUTS , as the film exists today , is not very impressive ( there is one scene where he and Groucho try to greet Chico and Harpo as new customers at the hotel , and keep missing their hands ) . In ANIMAL CRACKERS he is Jamison , the secretary to " Captain Spaulding " , and has an amusing sequence regarding the immortal firm of " Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , & McCormick " . In HORSE FEATHERS he did take part in the mad football game at the end of the film . In DUCK SOUP , as assistant to Rufus T . Firefly , he had more sequences that were funny , such as when he gets slapped for telling a story to Groucho that Groucho had previously told to him . He also takes part in the " Fredonia's Going to War " number , and in the battle section at the end . But only the Hungerdunger scene in ANIMAL CRACKERS ( shared by Groucho ) , and this film , MONKEY BUSINESS , gives one an idea of Zeppo as an effective comic . Here , unlike the other four appearances , he is not connected in the past with Groucho . He is paired with him , when he and Groucho are hired by Alky Briggs to be his torpedoes . However , he is frequently chased on the boat , and finds time to romance the film's heroine , in one particularly good moment telling her of his eternal devotion to her just before fleeing from her side to avoid being captured by members of the ship's crew . He also is able to romance her at her coming out society party , and rescues her from Briggs ' gang . Here he finally does something normal to assist the film . He is a passably pleasant leading man , but nothing spectacular . MONKEY BUSINESS was also surreal in it's humor , best in the puppet show sequence and also the attempt of the four brothers to get off the boat pretending to be Chevalier . It is a very funny movie - maybe not the best of all their films ( DUCK SOUP or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA are that ) , but close to the best . As for Zeppo , he remained part of the act and the films for two more years , and then quit both to become a successful film agent . He would always be in Groucho's shadow as a comic , and even in death ( soon after Groucho's death in 1977 ) passed on with hardly any impact on the public . Had he branched out on his own ( if anyone had shown interest in such a move ) he might have had a chance to show his talents , but it is problematical .
492982	3280905	507783	10.0	Does Conscience Make Cowards of Us All ?	An interesting episode on this series which deals with the power of an apparition . Whether it is a ghost or the viewer's conscience is up to the viewer to decide , but it certainly evens the score . Ben Cooper plays Ronnie Watson , an ambitious jockey who will stop at nothing to win a race ( so long as he's not caught ) . The racetrack he is working at has an older jockey named Sam Barry ( Walter Burke ) who is well liked , and highly professional . Watson and Barry are in a close neck - to - neck race that Watson cheats on to win . Barry is aware of this , but the cheating is such that it is his behavior that is unfairly scrutinized . That is the first part of the story . The second part is about five years later , and Watson has managed to achieve quite a public image as a winning jockey . He is in another important race , but in the days before the race he keeps seeing Barry at different spots , not all of them the race track . Each time Barry is smiling somewhat sardonically at Watson , and each time disappears before Watson can confront him . SPOILER COMING UP : The race starts and Watson is in the lead for most of it , but in the last stretch he sees Barry on a horse approaching in such a way that the horse seems headed to collide with his horse . Watson pulls up his horse , thus throwing the race . When confronted by the judges , he insists he was in danger from the horse ridden by Barry and had no choice . This angers the judges even more , as Barry was not in the race on any horse . They review a film of the race , and on it you see Watson on his horse leading , and then pulling it to stop it for no reason . Finally , someone checks into Sam Barry's whereabouts , and finds he died only a couple of weeks earlier in a racing accident in South American , where he was still able to get jobs as a jockey . Watson is thrown out of racing for throwing the race . Now , to me this episode was one that did not depend on whether or not one accepted the solution that a real apparition of the dead man made Watson behave as he did . Either way , as a real ghost of the dead man coming back to even a score , or as a mental effect from a belated , guilty conscience , the conclusion of the story was really very effective . I also liked this episode because it touched on a subject that rarely is mentioned in movies or television . While films discussed heroes in sports like Rockne , Gipp , Piccolo ( football ) , Ruth , Gehrig , Cobb , Alexander , Dean , Lewis , Pearsall ( baseball ) , Thorpe ( Olympics and professional baseball and football ) , Sullivan , Corbett , Johnson , Dempsey , Braddock , Louis & Schmeling ( boxing ) , Hogan ( golf ) , it rarely tried to touch on racing to honor any major jockey . If you think about it , NATIONAL VELVET and it's sequel INTERNATIONAL VELVET did look at the issue of training for a major race from a jockey's perspective , but the jockeys were fictitious in both cases ( and of amateur standing ) . The only film that mentioned a real , famous jockey was YANKEE DOODLE DANDY , because George M . Cohan's first successful musical ( LITTLE JOHNNY JONES ) was based on the scandal that engulfed Tod Sloan , America's leading jockey in 1903 , when he was disqualified in the English Derby . There was no film about say Eddie Arcaro , or about Fred Archer , 19th Century England's most successful jockey ( known as " the Tin-man " , because betting on his horse inevitably led to being a big winner ) . ( After writing the above last night it dawned on me that the " heroes " or " heroines " of such films are the horses - they are beautiful animals , usually lovable , and magnificent pure speed machines . So we have films like PHAR LAP and SEABISCUIT . ) I bring this out because in actuality leading jockeys are well known , but seem to get short shrift in comparison to their counterparts in other sports . It is as though the glory of riding a horse to victory is besmirched because of the gambling involved ( a fate that baseball almost shared until the aftermath of the Black Sox Scandal ) . Yet Watson manages to get some high degree of public notice by his successful racing . In fact , one of the interesting things about the tele-play here is that we see Watson in his apartment talking to another person about how really famous he's become . It seems they have just finished shooting a television show in his apartment , and it was some kind of interview , and only really famous are on that show . Of course , in 1959 , the viewing audience would guess that Watson had just been on PERSON - TO - PERSON , being interviewed by Edward R . Murrow . It's a curious reference point , both in showing Watson's growing fame , but in reminding us of a contemporary television show . So for all these reasons , I enjoyed this episode of ONE STEP BEYOND , and recommend it to the viewers .
492848	3280905	25878	10.0	An unexpected boon to Dashiell Hammett	Dashiell Hammett constructed five novels and many short stories , all dealing with crime and detection . They were based on his work as a Pinkerton Detective , which gives them a gritty realism that lifted them from the more forgettable mystery novels of the 1920s like S . S . Van Dine's " Philo Vance " . Up to Hammett's time American mystery novelists would try to copy the styles of British mystery novelists . Perhaps the most original type of mystery writer in America was Mary Roberts Rinehart , who constructed the " Had I but known " school in which a naive heroine is swept into a romance or marriage with a handsome , dashing type , who turns out to be a secret killer or fortune hunter or generally evil type . It actually worked - and influenced other writers ( the type of story is found in variations in such movies as THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE or UNDERCURRENT ) . It worked for Rinehart , who used her massive profits to help build up the publishing house . But Hammett was willing to show the real crime in urban American . He also was able to have a clean writing style , and even toyed with symbolism on a limited scale ( like how he turns " the Thin Man " of this story into a slenderer and slenderer figure until he is actually a skeleton ) . Another thing that Hammett brought in was his political sympathies . He hated being a paid goon for the rich as a Pinkerton operative . So some of his stories ( RED HARVEST , for instance ) is about the underlying labor / capital tensions in an industrial town . There are traces about this in THE THIN MAN , where Nora likes Nick's lowlife friends - the antithesis of the snobs she grew up with . In 1934 he was living in California with the woman who would be his lover until his death in 1961 : dramatist Lilian Hellman . He was approached to write a novel for a large sum of money . Most of his work he carefully thought out , but this was a pot boiler . He did not realize that it would be the biggest best seller of his career ( yes , even more than THE MALTESE FALCON ) . THE THIN MAN is basically a fantasy . Most of the detectives in his other stories are hard working poor guys like Sam Spade or " the Continental Op " [ for Operative ] . Here Nick Charles was the hard working poor guy detective , but he married Nora , an heiress . So he retires from detecting and is managing her properties . Nora , by the way , is based on Lillian's personality ( supposedly ) . There is more comedy in the story than in most of the others ( think of THE GLASS KEY for a more typical Hammett plot ) . There is also more drinking , which was , unfortunately , the situation in the Hammett - Hellman household . And the plot was complicated and clever : where did the inventor disappear to ? Did he murder his thieving mistress ? Or did anyone else cause the murder ? With a cast headed by William Powell and Myrna Loy ( actually the first time they were paired as the leads , as opposed to MANHATTAN MELODRAMA that they shared with Clark Gable ) they were both brilliant as a realistic married couple . In fact they would play a perfect married couple in five more " Thin Man " films , and four other movies as well . The rest of the cast , Maureen O'Sullivan , Minna Gombell , Porter Hall , Nat Pendleton , Harold Huber , Edward Ellis , and Ed Brophy were fantastically good too . Under Woody Van Dyke's skillful direction they created a great detective film . And they gave Dashiell Hammett further film work for over a decade .
493237	3280905	62765	10.0	Still the greatest car chase sequence in any thriller ever made	I have found in my life that few films hit me properly from the start . BULLITT ( which I first saw at College ) was one of them . It cemented my high opinion of the cinematic acting ability of Steve McQueen , and it has always struck me as one of the best police " procedural " films in terms of the way the investigation is handled by McQueen's titled character . But the chase , at the center of the film , is the highpoint that made me love the film . And oddly enough , Director Peter Yates manages to somewhat top it with the second chase through the runways of an airport at the film's conclusion . McQueen works under Simon Oakland as a detective in the San Francisco Police Department . He lives with his artistic girlfriend Jacqueline Bissett . One day he is one of the detectives assigned to protect an important witness against the mob that is supposed to be presented to the anti-crime commission by millionaire / would-be politician Robert Vaughn . The witness is set up in a motel with policemen as guards . There should be no problem . Yet two mob hit men manage to crash in , wound the police ( one fatally ) and kill the witness . McQueen is told of this and goes to the hospital . He has little use for Vaughn ( an arrogant creep if ever there was one ) , or his stooge central police connection Norman Fell . His sole interest now is to find the killers and figure out what happened . He does so by hiding the fact that the witness died - and spreading the word that the police are now redoubling efforts to protect the witness . While Vaughn fumes and Fell threatens Oakland and McQueen , the latter continues the investigation , aided by cabby Robert Duvall ( in an early role ) . This leads to the chase sequence , which starts with us being aware that the cab and then McQueen's car are being followed by a car with the two hit men in it . The beginning of the sequence is mild , as we see them driving after McQueen , but the turning point is when they have apparently lost him , and he reappears following their car . Then they go into the outskirts of San Francisco , and the roads from the city , with the added threats of other vehicles and of a twelve gage sawed - off shotgun one of the hit men uses . There are nice procedural moments throughout : McQueen seeing the set up of the now closed crime scene at the motel , with ribbons tracing the trajectories of the bullets ; the investigation of a dead woman's trunk and belongings to figure out why she was killed ; a sequence with a 1968 version ( possibly a first ) of a fax machine of that period - a favorite scene of mine because it knocks the props out of both Vaughn's arrogance and Fell's belief that his own future in the police is made . And the issues of the effect of the job on McQueen is not forgotten either . Bissett witnesses the aftermath of some violence , and confronts him on how he can stand it every day . I do not think any other crime and cop thriller ever hit the notes so naturally and perfectly together . The cast helps from McQueen down to the two hit men ( silent roles for stunt men ) . Witness too that Simon Oakland plays a nice character for once , and does well with his part ( look at the scene between him and a threatening Vaughn outside the church Oakland is taking his family to on Sunday ) . Vaughn is great as a smarmy , selfish piece of work who sees people as pawns to play with for his own benefit . McQueen finally tells him off , but does it effectively and without histrionics . This is one of those films that just never ages .
492729	3280905	37794	10.0	Orange Pips and Murders	Except for the first two Basil Rathbone / Nigel Bruce Holmes'films ( set in the 19th Century ) and THE SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH , THE HOUSE OF FEAR has the best plot of any of the series . Like the other films in the series it is stretching the original story ( let us say embellishing it ) . But the embellishing works . Who is killing off the members of THE GOOD COMRADES , a small friendship society live in an isolated country house ? The members are all successful professional men now in retirement - except one : Dr . Simon Merivale ( Paul Cavanagh ) . Holmes is called in by an insurance company , who notes that the members of the society are the beneficiaries of the life policies of the dead members . Holmes notes Merivale , a very brilliant surgeon , murdered his wife a number of years before and did such a bang-up job defending himself before a jury that he was acquitted . So he is already suspect number one . But Holmes discovers that some of the murders are committed when Merivale could not have committed them . Subsequently he has to look at the others , Henry Cording , Holmes Herbert , and Aubrey Mather . And every time the same crazy set of circumstances prevents him from choosing one of them as the killer . Oh yes , the " orange pips " . It seems that the unknown killer delights in taunting his victims by having the maid deliver ( at dinner , before the next murder ) a sealed , unsigned envelop containing orange pips . The number of pips in the envelop tell you how many days the proposed victim has left . See , I told you it's a neat plot . Lestrade is here ( Hoey as funny as usual - note his scene where he compares his foot with the killer's shoe ) . Aubrey Mather as the owner of the house is genial and weird . Cavanagh is properly superior and untrustworthy ( it was one of three films in the series he popped up in , and he did fine in all three - he was a good actor in both villain and sympathetic roles , and yet never quite got the popularity of others like him , like Thomas Gomez , Henry Daniell , Lionel Atwill , and George Zucco , possibly because he seemed too friendly at times ) . Also notice Sally Montieth as the creepy , gloomy maidservant / housekeeper . The film is based on " THE ADVENTURE OF THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS " from the first collection of Holmes ' short stories THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES . In the original the basic story concentrates not on an insurance murder plot but on a criminal gang and their targeting one family again and again and again . Conan Doyle was well read in crime literature and fact , and his gang is none other than the Ku Klux Klan . It must have been a revelation ( to readers in 1891 London ) to hear about the racist organization , but it fits in quite nicely in the original story - if not in this fine variation of it .
491839	3280905	31971	10.0	The perfect western from Guy De Maupassant	In the 1880s the master of the French short story wrote a classic about the Franco Prussian War entitled " Boule De Suite " ( translation : " Ball of Fat " - a reference to the nickname of the heroine ) . It dealt with a coach of middle class Frenchmen traveling together in 1870 , who are captured by Germans ( it is during the Franco - Prussian War ) . One of the passengers is a prostitute the others look down upon , although she is a nice person . The Prussian officer in charge takes an interest in the prostitute , and the others notice this . They overcome her patriotic scruples and she agrees to sleep with the Prussian . As a result the passengers are released . But once they return to their journey , they snub the poor young woman - she is still just a whore , even if she saved them all . The story was actually filmed in the 1940s ( produced by Val Lewton and starring Simone Simone as the prostitute ) as MADEMOISELLE FIFI . It is not considered one of Lewton's classic films ( certainly not in the same breath as his three films with Boris Karloff ) . But in 1939 it was part of the basis of this film , one of the greatest Westerns and John Ford movies of all times : STAGECOACH . Claire Trevor is the prostitute taken from the De Maupassant story . But she is not given the same central ironic position that her French original had . Trevor does not have to sleep with the enemy to save lives , only to be spurned by them . That she is spurned by them is part of the plot , but her prostitute is far luckier than the original one . Trevor actually has a chance for real happiness in the end . Now set in 1884 , STAGECOACH is set in the southwest , where a stagecoach is leaving a small dirt town with a mixed crowd of passengers ( several of them are outcasts types - borrowing a little from Bret Harte's short story " The Outcasts Of Poker Flats " . The passengers to the larger city of Loudsberg include the town trollop ( Trevor ) , the town gambler and ex-Confederate ( John Carridine ) , the town's drunken doctor ( Thomas Mitchell ) , the wife of an Army Captain ( Louisa Platt ) , a liquor salesman with a satchel of samples ( Donald Meek ) , the town's Sheriff - going because of current dangers from the Apaches under Geronimo ( George Bancroft ) , and the stagecoach driver ( Andy Devine ) . Bancroft is going along because he knows the Apaches are on the warpath and have cut the telegraph lines to Loudsburg . Therefore he is surprised when the town banker ( Berton Churchill - in his possibly most disagreeable character part ) shows up on the town's outskirts with a single large carpet bag and the statement that he just got a telegram to head for Loudsburg for business . What's up there ? It is a crowded little world inside the stagecoach , with Trevor being cold shouldered by Churchill , Platt , and Carridine ( although the others treat her better ) . Carridine , proud of his Southern military heritage collides with Mitchell , a former Northern soldier . Mitchell keeps emptying out Meek's sample case ( at one point Meek tries to stop him very gently - it doesn't work ) . Churchill keeps bloviating about Government interference with banks ( to the annoyance of everyone else ) . Carridine shows most consideration of Platt , who is pregnant . This seems tied to knowing that at one time Carridine served under Platt's southern father ( but under his real name - not his current one of " Hatfield " ) . Bancroft , when not thinking of the mystery of Churchill's appearance , is watching for the arrival of the cavalry to protect the stage , and the dangerous Apaches . Then he and Devine see a figure on the road - it is John Wayne in the cinematic moment when he stopped being an actor in grade B westerns . John Ford just shows his tall figure rising out of the earth as the stagecoach screeches to a halt . Bancroft now has another problem - and a personal opportunity . Wayne is " the Ringo Kid " , a wanted prison escapee - he too wants to go to Loudsburg to kill Luke Plummer ( Tom Tyler ) and his two brothers , who murdered his own father and brother and stole their land . Bancroft , a peace officer , arrests him - but because of the situation Wayne is allowed to have free movement . Soon he and Trevor begin noticing each other - and becoming attracted . The film builds through a series of sequences that have classic , such as Mitchell's pulling himself together to deliver Platt's baby . The balance of the film is perfect , as is the casting . We end caring for these souls ( except possibly Churchill ) . And it concludes with one of the best filmed showdowns in movies . Made eight years after CIMMERON won the first Best Film Oscar , STAGECOACH was deserving of the same award , but it came out in the best year for Hollywood movies in the Golden Age of the talkies ( and GONE WITH THE WIND won instead ) . But it has maintained it's standard of greatness , and remains the yardstick for all Westerns that have been made since .
493396	3280905	33533	10.0	Even Devils and Millionaires Need Tender Loving Care	John P . Merrick is the world's richest man , and owner of a department store in New York City like Macy's . He lives in a nice mansion in Manhattan with his butler George ( S . Z . Sakall ) , and conducts the daily running of his empires ruthlessly . He is the " Devil " in this movie , and would not care if anybody disliked him for that . But he discovers a worm in his garden . There is a budding labor union in his department store . The apparent key to it is one Joe O'Brien ( Bob Cummings ) who is outspoken , fearless , and a trifle feckless . Joe's chief allies in the store are his girlfriend Mary Jones ( Jean Arthur ) and her closest friend Elizabeth Ellis ( Spring Byington ) . Their activities are watched by store detectives ( like William Demerest ) who report to the store manager Mr . Allison ( Walter Kingsford , in one of his less likable parts ) . But they ( and Merrick ) are aware that many on the staff are members of the incipient union , and Merrick is determined to locate and discharge them . Merrick disguises himself as a new employee and starts working undercover in the department store's shoe department ( where Mary works ) . It becomes quite an education for Merrick . On the one hand he is still looking for the union members , but he is also getting a taste of what his employees are up against - especially when he meets the department head , Mr . Hooper ( Edmund Gwenn ) . When we think of department stores and Gwenn we think of his Oscar winning performance as Kris Kringle in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET , but we rarely recall that while Gwenn was good at eccentric , nice elderly men ( like the counterfeiter in MR . 880 ) he could plays nastier types ( like the would-be assassin in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT ) . Hooper is one of the most supercilious snobs imaginable - and all he really is is the head clerk of the shoe department ! Merrick also discovers a gentler portion of the universe . Mary introduces him to her friend Elizabeth ( whom Hooper is interested in - the triangle here is similar to the triangle in LOUISA ) . At home , due to nerves and ulcers from his hard grind , Merrick is stuck eating broken crackers in milk for dinner . But Elizabeth is so relaxing , he's able to eat her regular chicken dinners for lunch . Soon Merrick finds himself a fourth with Mary , Joe , and Elizabeth on the weekends . And he's enjoying it ! With THE LADY EVE , THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES showed that Charles Coburn was capable of good comic performances , and his sharing film screen time with Jean Arthur ( and his friend Edmund Gwenn and Spring Byington ) showed that their styles of comedy mingled perfectly together . It points the way to his Oscar winner THE MORE THE MERRIER , and his wonderful work in LOUISA . My favorite parts are his scenes with Gwenn here , trying to beat him as a salesman ( only to discover he can't handle the kid that Sakall brings in to buy shoes ) , and his scene where he tries to impress Arthur , Cummings , and Byington at Coney Island with a rare wine from his cellar - only to be told by Cummings , who spits it out , he's been robbed ( and he goes berserk watching Cummings spill out the rest of the " bad wine " ) . Also note the rest of the cast - in particular Frank Conroy as a police sergeant who knows when to cut a loss ( a far cry from Conroy's Major Tetley in THE OX-BOW INCIDENT ) . A well made comedy , it reminds us that even the richest man in the world may need personal attention that money can't buy .
493047	3280905	42810	10.0	A Submarine Disaster Situation	Every now and then we are reminded of the so-called " silent service " - the submarine arm of the navy . It is hard to believe nowadays but active use of submarines in warfare is barely over one century old . There had been three attempts at getting submarines into warfare before the 1880s : in the American Revolution , when Connecticut inventor David Bushnell designed the " Turtle " to attack Admiral Howe's flagship in New York Harbor ; when Robert Fulton attempted to interest Napoleon Bonaparte in his submarine as a weapon against the British fleet in 1800 ; and when the Confederate ( and Northern ) navies experimented with torpedo boats and submarines - culminating in the success of the C . S . S . Hunley - in the American Civil War . But the real spur was anti-British animus in Irish-American circles in the 1880s , when they financed the researches of John P . Holland . It was his successful submarine that became the model adopted by most navies . But that was after 1900 , and the early submarines were small and unpleasant and smelly craft ( due to the closed space and the gasoline fumes ) . Disasters occurred frequently enough . It was not until the sinking of three British cruisers on one day in 1914 by U-boat Captain Weddingen that their power became widely realized . The number of maritime fatalities ( led by R . M . S . Lusitania ) demonstrated how deadly these ships could become . So by the end of the war everyone was improving their submarine fleets . But the ships still had major disasters in the 1920s and 1930s . 1939 was a banner year with major French , British , and American sub disasters . But the last one , the U . S . S . Squalus off Portsmouth , New Hampshire , was important for another reason . For one of the few times in modern history , the crew of a disabled submarine was mostly rescued . Diving bells and decompression chambers saved nearly two thirds of Squalus ' crew ( and the sub was raised , repaired , and recommissioned to be of use in World War II ) . But Squalus sank very close to land , and the depth was not an impossibly deep one as a result . Still it was quite a rarity to have survivors of a sub sinking . With a normal shipwreck ( of a surface vessel ) the crew has a chance to use lifeboats , life preservers , floating wreckage , rafts . You can't readily do that if you are underwater to begin with . For some reason submarine disaster films have rarely appeared on screen . There were films about submarines ( several versions of Jules Verne's TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA , for instance ) , and even of the wartime subs . For instance RUN SILENT , RUN DEEP , and DESTINATION , TOKYO were two . Some misfires also appeared . Charles Laughton appeared as an insanely jealous submarine commander opposite Gary Cooper and Tallulah Bankhead in THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP ( he scuttles his own vessel at the end , going down with the ship ) . But films about actual tragedies never popped up . Except for this British film . John Mills is the commander of a submarine out on maneuvers in the British Channel . A mechanical failure causes it to sink . Mills is able to get most of his men out using snorkel breathing apparatus , and shooting them out of the torpedo tube . But he is unable to do it for the last three men in the sub with him : James Hayter , Richard Attenborough , and Nigel Patrick . In their situation they have to just wait out official attempts at rescue . But this is based on the amount of oxygen left on board , and how long it will last . Also , it is turning the ship into a huge tomb for them . And Attenborough , who has claustrophobic problems to begin with , is going over the edge . Patrick turns out to have physical problems that if not treated will possibly be fatal . It is not a happy situation . It is a gritty little movie , and it has it's moments of unexpected reality . Hayter was not supposed to be on the cruise , but at the last moment he agreed to go in place of a fellow seaman who had to attend an ailing wife . Details like that make one realize what a gamble our daily life experiences can be . As a look at a disaster that is normally uncommon ( but still possible - remember the Russian tragedy of the " Kursk " ) , with four good performances in it , I strongly catching this film .
493283	3280905	58333	10.0	Possibly the Best Corman film	When Edgar Allan Poe wrote THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH , I keep thinking he was thinking about some classic literature of the past . First , he is taking ( and inverting ) the basic plot of Boccacio's collection of short stories THE DECAMERON . If you recall , ten young people ( five men and five women ) of aristocratic families go to the country to avoid the plague in Florence . They entertain each other by each telling ten stories a night to the others - mostly dealing with love . They survive the plague as a result . Poe's Prince takes all his friends and fellow aristocrats out of a plague drenched countryside and they go to his castle in the hills . But at the end they all die . The other classic story is William Shakespeare's final great play , THE TEMPEST , wherein the master of the island and of all the elements nature ( which he controls as a wizard ) is Prospero , former Duke of Milan ( pronounced Millon ) . Here , the Prince Prospero is unable to control nature and all die as a result . The story THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH is about the inevitability of fate and death - nobody can avoid it , no matter how hard they build up walls , and in the end they end up searching out for it ( and finding it ) . Roger Corman , as I mentioned in discussing his film about Richard III , took to Edgar Allan Poe as no other major director of horror had before him . But he had to expand it . Poe only wrote one novel , THE NARRATIVE OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM OF NANTUCKET ( although he tried to do a second one called THE JOURNAL OF JULIUS RODMAN ) . Most of his writings are short stories , poetry , one play , and essays of criticism or philosophy . His best short stories are meant to be read within one hour or two at most . A great story , like THE TELL-TALE HEART , can be read with forty minutes , as it's story line is fairly concise and it is the choice and sound of words that carries it's best affects ( i . e . , the sound of the heart of the victim ) . So a filmed record of a Poe story should really be about thirty minutes tops , as visual effects replace ( or enhance ) the verbal ones . Corman , therefore , had to expand the story line - good as Poe made it originally . First , he makes Prospero a Satan worshiper and sadist . Then , he adds a mild subplot involving one of Prospero's guests ( Alfredo - Patrick Magee ) and Prospero's dwarf jester Hop - Toad ( Skip Martin ) , which is actually the plot of Poe's story HOP-FROG . There is also two expansions of the plot tied to the Prince : his kidnapping of Francesca ( Jane Asher ) , Gino ( David Weston ) and Ludovico ( Nigel Green ) and the doomed hope of Juliana ( Hazel Court ) to achieve the goals of total acceptance by Satan in order to secure her hold on Prospero . The end result is not bloated , phony-Poe , but a serious philosophical debate that the evil Prospero actually articulates : He explains to Francesca that he became a Satanist because of serious questions he had about the validity of Christianity . He sees the world as a mess , kept in order only by the powerful and wealthy . He feels that the God of Christianity ( of " Love " ) is actually dead - killed centuries before . Whatever is running the world is not a God of Love . Francesca , of course , is a simpler type who keeps insisting that love and hope make life far more pleasant and bearable than Prospero's view implies . She is as set in her views as he is in his . This philosophical balance remains to the end , although until the end does come through , Francesca actually commits herself to trying to see it from Prospero's point of view ( a very remarkable willingness to get a complete view of things - but she never does have to follow through with this offer ) . Is there some truth to Prospero's viewpoint ? Many viewers are turned off by his willingness to make sadistic tests and punishments ( even sadistic " joke " games on his willing guests ) . But what do people like Francesca and Gino , despite their love , have to look forward to ? The townspeople who die at the hands of the Red Death had very poor , awful lives ( it's the Middle Ages folks ) , and at the end the Red Death and his fellow deaths comment that at least they brought peace to the people who died . But that hardly seems a worthwhile conclusion or goal . Die and you'll be peaceful and happy ? While Satanism is no answer , certainly some way of pushing up living standards would be . The film holds up very nicely , and leaves one thinking at the end - what is the point of balance that makes life more than mere temporary existence and actually worth living ? It is certainly one of the most thought provoking horror films Corman created .
492494	3280905	49601	10.0	The Movie Version of the Sterling Drama about Big Business	There are two interesting changes in the film version of PATTERNS and the previous television drama version . First , Richard Kiley ( unlike Ed Begley Sr . and Everett Sloane ) was replaced in his part by Van Heflin . Secondly Begley's character Andy Sloane was changed in name to Bill Briggs . This may have been because of confusion for the audience in Begley's original name and his co-star's last name ( Everett Sloane ) . But it is a minor change . The thrust of the film's views on corporate philosophy in America remains as tough and unsentimental here as in the television version . Heflin's Fred Staples is a bit older than Kiley's , which slightly undercuts that figures ' weakness ( his naivety when he arrives in the world of high corporate politics ) but it enables his growing friendship with Begley to seem more realistic - they are from closer age groups , and Begley can tell that Heflin is not trying to be a threat that a younger man might be . Sloane's Ramsay is still the human icicle , who is only interested in the growth and development of his corporation - and not with outdated ideas that Begley keeps pushing . That said , he still shows regret - after Begley dies we see Sloane back in the fatal board room where the tragedy occurred , and he is upset about the deadly result of his actions on Begley . But when confronted by a furious Heflin Sloane is ready to defend his policies and philosophy of the bottom line of business as well as anyone can . The film is excellent , and if I favor the television play more it is simply that the television play was there first - and hit the right notes as well . I still recommend seeing the film if you can't see the original kine-scope of the television version . You won't be disappointed .
492178	3280905	34272	10.0	The Naval Hero and the Ambassador's Wife	Nations need their heroes , sometimes with great desperation . Such was the case in the series of wars from 1792 to 1815 which were fought between Great Britain and first Revolutionary France and then the First French Empire . Britain had to finance this series of wars , because the various major continental powers it tried to ally itself with again and again against the French ( and later against Napoleon I ) were financially unable to support the war efforts ( especially after the French would defeat the armies of these countries , march in , and change their government ) . The British also fought the French army and navy face to face . But here was the problem : Up until the second period of the wars ( 1802 - 1815 ) Britain produced no field commander of real stature . The General-in-Chief of the Army was George III's favorite son , Frederick , Duke of York , who was ( apparently ) able but little else . He is the one in the old nursery rhyme song , " The good old Duke of York , he had 10 , 000 men . . . . " Frederick never showed more than moderate abilities as a field commander , but it was smashed when his mistress , Mary Ann Clarke , was caught selling commissions in the army for a " commissions fee " . Fred resigned . Mary did not go to prison ( her grandson was the author of PETER IBBETSON and TRILBY , George du Maurier ; her great grandson was the stage star Gerald du Maurier ; her great granddaughter and biographer the author of REBECCA and JAMAICA INN and FRENCHMAN'S CREEK Daphne du Maurier - not bad for a so-called " fallen woman " . ) . It would not be until the appearance of those two stunningly good generals , Sir John Moore ( who built up British field performance before his death at Corunna in 1809 ) and Arthur Wellesley ( later the Duke of Wellington ) { who learned military technique in India , took it to Europe , drove the French out of Spain , and defeated Napoleon at Waterloo ) that the army finally got good commanders . Notably after their arrival Napoleon and the French were defeated . But for the first part of the wars 1792 - 1802 it was the Navy that really gave England her heroes . And the hero it gave was Horatio Nelson , who even today is considered England's greatest naval tactician . When he came on the scene there were others : Richard , Lord Howe , who won the " Glorious First of June " in 1794 , and Adam Duncan , who won the battle Camperdown in 1798 ( following the Great Fleet Mutiny of that year - see DAMN THE DEFIANT ) . But Nelson had a string of them , from Cape St . Vincent ( in 1797 ) , to the stunning battle of the Nile ( 1798 ) to Copenhagen ( 1800 ) to his greatest victory Trafalgar ( 1805 ) where he was shot down in battle . In these battles he repeatedly bent or threw away the textbook regulations that had fossilized most naval officers . He also built up a group of fellow officers who continued his innovations ( Cuthbert Collingwood , Thomas Hardy , Troubridge , Lord Cochrane ) and pursued the French until the end of the war . These men stiffened that impregnable wooden wall that kept the French from taking Britain and ruling the world . THAT HAMILTON WOMAN deals with the one flaw in his record as a man - an understandable one . In command of the Meditteranean Fleet in 1797 - 98 , Nelson frequently docked in the allied Kingdom of Naples . The royal family was advised closely by Sir William Hamilton , the British Ambassador there . Sir William and his wife Emma held a miniature court , advising the locals and meeting celebrities . Emma Hamilton was a very beautiful woman , and Sir William married her because of that - her background was not great ( one of her best jobs was working for a quack doctor in London ) . Emma met Nelson , and the two fell in love . Hamilton was aware of this , but as it was England's greatest hero he winked at his wife's new lover . Eventually it became known . As Nelson was married ( to a clergyman's daughter ) and had a child it did not sit very well . . . as far as Emma went . Horatio was allowed to do whatever he wanted - he was saving the country . In fact , in 1803 he actually gave testimony for the defense of Colonel Marcus Despard , a friend who went mad and tried to overthrow the government and assassinate King George III ( Despard was still found guilty and executed ) . Up to his heroic death , Nelson could do no wrong . But Emma was left after 1805 to go into poverty and exile in Calais , France , where she died in 1818 . This film is a rare one . It is one of the few made by Olivier and his wife Vivien Leigh , and only FIRE OVER ENGLAND merits comparison . Both give good account of themselves as the lovers , although their relationship was a bit more boisterous and noisy than this account makes it . Gladys Cooper is splendid in her one scene as Nelson's wronged wife confronting Leigh . Alan Mowbray has a rarity - a moving dying scene . Sir William was one of England's great art collectors , but the ship with his wonderful collection was wrecked when he returned home . He suffered a stroke that killed him , and that also affected his mind . Watch him request his servant shift a now non-existent painting on the wall because it's crooked . Quite unforgettable .
492448	3280905	62407	10.0	A Bumpy Road Trip In a 10 Year Marriage	TWO FOR THE ROAD is probably the least recalled of Audrey Hepburn's major movies . She is such a succulent elfin personality that most movie lovers think of her best work as between 1953 and 1965 . In those films , even if she is glamorous ( Holly Golightly or Regina Lambert ) she is fragile , confused , endangered , and young . She occasionally shows vast amounts of competence in grown-up professions , as in THE NUN STORY , but she is most often a young person who barely understands what she is involved with ( FUNNY FACE , LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON , SABRINA ) until slapped in the face . TWO FOR THE ROAD was something different for her . She was entering her thirties , and she could not really play young elfin types for much longer ( when she and Albert Finney appear as the younger Joanna and Mark , she has the same energy as Finney , but he is able to hide his being older better than she can - but the film is so good we accept this ) . So here she is entering the films where she is into middle age . Only WAIT UNTIL DARK remained to show the elfin victim type again ( helped by her character having a major disability : blindness ) . After that her films concentrated ( like TWO FOR THE ROAD ) on Hepburn having children or aging ( ROBIN AND MARIAN ; THEY ALL LAUGHED ) . She meets Finney when she is a member of a woman's chorus traveling ( back-packing ) through Europe . Having had chicken pox in her youth , she is the only member who is free of danger from that disease when a case of it infects everyone else . She and Finney ( a struggling architect on vacation ) go through a series of picaresque adventures that gradually bring the two together when he proposes marriage . But these events are cut into chunks that are mixed with other events in the couple's marriage in a ten year period . Subsequent chunks of their lives shown are a trip they took with William Daniels and Eleanor Bron ( and their bratty daughter ) , a continuation of the trip in a second-hand MG that leads to a fire , their introduction to Claude Dauphin who ends up hiring Finney , and the resulting alienation between Finney and Hepburn because of his success driving a wedge between them . The fun loving lovers of the initial two and half years are replaced by the upper class people with a daughter , who have found each other's less pleasant characteristics more grating . And those characteristics are increasingly centered on Dauphin's continuously demanding business " conferences " with Finney , and the " le dolce vita " life style of Dauphin and his family and friends . By cross cutting between the different chunks of story , the differences are heightened . A comment or incident of one year , is shown to ironic commentary later ( example : the lovely Meditteranean Beach where Finney proposes to Hepburn ends up being developed by Dauphin and Finney for houses - and at one point Dauphin asks Finney to have the workmen stop working while he and his friends enjoy a picnic . The film's cast and director ( Stanley Donen ) and composer ( Henry Mancini ) did very nicely here - Mancini creating a memorable theme tune that is still played . On the whole , it is a bumpy and complex trip on the road of life , but a fascinating one - and one that we are uncertain of the final outcome up to the moment the hero and heroine make their last comments to each other before they kiss .
491818	3280905	51201	10.0	The Best of the Pre - 1970s Agatha Christie films ?	After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE , the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the ill-matched couple , but re-staged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England . Then , in 1957 , Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION . With a tip-top cast of Charles Laughton , Marlene Dietrich , Tyrone Power , and Elsa Lancaster , the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story , changed in it's ending ( but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization ) . Leonard Vole ( Tyrone Power ) is a salesman who meets an elderly , wealthy woman ( Norma Varden ) and gains her affections - much to the dislike and mistrust of her servant ( Una O'Connor ) . O'Connor claims she saw the two together the night that Varden was beaten to death in her apartment . Vole is arrested , and his solicitor ( Henry Daniell ) wants England's best barrister , Sir Wilfred Robarts ( Laughton ) to defend him . Robarts is recovering from a heart attack , and is being nursed by Miss Plimsoll ( Elsa Lancaster ) . He is a difficult patient , and is not looking forward to an enforced rest in Bermuda . So , despite the protests of Plimsoll he takes the case . He does promise her he will listen to his doctor and take his medicine . She does not trust him . Sir Robert meets Vole's German born wife , Christina Helm ( Dietrich ) , who alarms him . She is too cool , to detached at her husband's peril . But he goes ahead , and is soon in court fighting a first rate opponent ( Torin Thatcher as Myers ) , and scores some impressive points against the prosecution , especially in cross-examining O'Connor . But at the critical moment he finds that by a subtle point of law , Dietrich can testify against Power , and does so . So the plot becomes , how to defeat this " witness for the prosecution " ? Is there something that can turn the tables on her and her testimony . And the evidence to use against Dietrich does appear - from an unexpected source . Is it effective ? Will Power be saved in the end ? Or is there something going on ? Although the conclusion of this film has been pretty well known for years , I will refrain from explaining what it is . A good mystery should surprise the audience , as this does every audience that sees it for the first time . Laughton and Lancaster make a funny pair ( and in the end , an endearing one from Lancaster's point of view ) . Power gets to play his most sinister part since " the Great Stanton " Carlyle in NIGHTMARE ALLEY . And Dietrich does pull off the biggest surprise twist in her career . As for Wilder , after some questionable films in the mid 1950s ( THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH , THE SPIRIT OF ST . LOUIS ) he was back in form . His handling of the courtroom scenes ( which make up nearly 60 % of the film ) are far more realistic and speedy than Alfred Hitchcock's plodding THE PARADINE CASE a decade earlier . It was the best of the Christie films prior to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS .
