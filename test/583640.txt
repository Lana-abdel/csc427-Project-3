579340	583640	118979	1.0	If there's a film worse than this one , I don't want to see it	I happened to catch this on a premium channel a while back and I've got news for you : it makes Showgirls look like Casablanca or Gone With the Wind by comparison . I'm one who happens to believe that the merits of a film are to a degree relative ; you don't judge Bikini Carwash by comparing it to , say , Schindler's List , as an example . But for the type of movie , compared to others in the same vein , it's lousy . I don't bore easily at all , but this one did that in spades . If you want something like this , look for Kira Reed in the cast and it's probably worth seeing . But this one reeks !
579230	583640	262480	5.0	This one just didn't work for me .	This one did not impress me very much . I don't care for the Beat movement at all , the animation was marginal at best , the POINT was so obvious that I felt that the writer / director was beating me over the head with it most of a very short film and this just didn't work for me on any level . If your tastes run to Beat poetry and polemics , you may enjoy this one . You are thus warned : for me , here there be boredom . It can be found on Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation , Vol 4 , I believe .
579968	583640	22710	5.0	Except for a running gag featuring an eagle in the last part of the short , this one is pretty unmemorable .	There's not much to this short apart from one running gag and a few sight gags . You get a general feeling about the whole , but very little stands out and makes a lasting impression . I will discuss one or two things here , so this is a spoiler warning : The cartoon has some cute gags in the first couple of minutes , with the marching band and what looks like a moose doubling as a turnstile . Intercut in here are scenes of Bosko being tortured under the guise of being given a " massage " ( ouch ! ) . The football game is really not very interesting in and of itself . There are one or two good gags and some horrible puns that pop up . Most of the funny stuff is off the field antics ( a reporter pounding away at his typewriter until the typewriter pounds back , a face appearing in the crowd watching the game in obvious disapproval , etc . ) . Toward the end , they periodically cut away to an eagle perched upon a flagpole . This running bit is far more interesting than the rest of the short and the ending is quite good . I won't spoil it here . Though this cartoon is not all that special , I hope it is released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection at some point . Worth watching once .
578974	583640	22679	5.0	Not much to this particular short , which is limited , even for a Bosko	Though there are a few nice bits in here , there really isn't much substance to this one overall . It's just an average short , with little to interest or bore the general viewer . If you really like Bosko , you'll enjoy it enormously . There will be spoilers from here on out : This short can basically be summed up as follows : See Bosko . See Bruno . See Bosko skate . See Bruno repeat a gag three times and eventually fall through a hole in the ice . See the foregoing take up almost half the cartoon . See Bruno find a baby . See Bosko and Bruno take the very loud baby home and try to make it happy . See Bruno sit on a stove . See baby laugh uproariously . See Bosko play the piano and sing . See baby dance and Bosko and baby sing in " scat " style . See Bosko have an accident and wind up with a fishbowl as headgear . See very mean baby laugh . Iris out . Not the greatest Bosko or the worst Bosko . This short is just " okay " . I do hope , however , that this ultimately does get released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection in the future . Worth watching at least once .
579621	583640	251027	5.0	Good animation , but the concept is tedious and grating here	The Hubleys used a technique a number of times where the simply recorded their children at play and then constructed the animation around whatever they did and said . Often , this worked out fairly well , Moonbird and Windy Day , for example . Here it did not work . The short is well animated , but the dialogue here becomes tedious and grating after a bit . Perhaps if it had been shorter , it would have worked better . Not one of their best . The more you like the Hubleys , the greater latitude you give them in cases like this . Still moderately interesting . Worth watching for the animation .
578929	583640	152006	6.0	Starts out well , but the one gag premise isn't substantial enough to keep this all that entertaining	There's basically one joke here-this lion is hungry ! Unfortunately , when the bulk of the gags bounce off of a single premise , there's a danger that they'll fall flat after a while and that's largely what happens here . I will be talking about some of the gags , so consider this a mild spoiler warning : When we meet the lion , he's hungry-he basically says so to the audience . We see him try twice to catch a meal , with very unsuccessful results . The second attempt is with a porcupine ( ouch ) ! He then hears a voice on a radio ( the radio actually has a mouth and talks ) which promises three meals a day if you go to their zoo . We see a hunter who bears a slight resemblance ( visually and vocally ) to Jerry Colonna , a popular character actor and radio personality , who was frequently caricatured in cartoons . The lion goes to take a physical and meets a skunk who tearfully says that they rejected him . The physical is perfunctory and punctuated by the lion begging the hunter for a meal . Even at the zoo , no one feeds him . The crowd of animals tells him , " You'll be sorry ! " , as he arrives and the crowd outside his cage heckles him . He finally rebels and escapes , thus starting a chase sequence sprinkled with food jokes . The lion is ultimately recaptured and caged again . The short ends on a high note , as the conclusion is funny , if a bit predictable to anyone who's watched many cartoons . Not a bad cartoon , just not as good as it could have been . This is on at least one inexpensive compilation DVD . Worth watching .
579877	583640	26310	6.0	Cute , if somewhat trite , little short .	This is a cute ( almost too cute ) little cartoon with only a few Fleischer touches and some reasonably good visuals . Catchy title tune , sung by an elephant , naturally . If you like the early Betty Boops , this one will leave you cold for the most part . But it is a pretty cartoon and is well worth watching , at least once . On the Somewhere In Dreamland DVD set , which is in print and available . You won't regret buying this one ! Recommended for kids and fans .
579961	583640	23835	6.0	See Bosko . See Bosko build a robot .	This short is reasonably decent , even if it basically copies a trend among other studios which did similar shorts based on the same premise and springing from roughly the same inspirational source . It was the last Bosko done for Warner Brothers , as Harman and Ising left there to go to MGM , where they used the character occasionally and drastically redesigned him , but that's another story . I want to talk about some of the gags , so this is a spoiler warning : In the 1930s , there was a movement called " Technocracy " , whose proponents believed that technology was the salvation of mankind . A number of shorts made use of the theory as a jumping-off point for the basic inspiration , including this one . The short begins with Honey doing housecleaning chores , specifically cleaning a window . Bosko makes the mistake of showing up ( he also takes Honey's flowers from the front yard to " give " them to Honey . Bruno , being far wiser , stays outside . Honey is delighted to see Bosko , telling him ( in a rhyming couplet , no less ) that he's going to help her with the dishes , which he finds terribly amusing . The scene dissolves to find Bosko and Honey-you guessed it-doing the dishes . Bosko , incapable of acting seriously , " shuffles " the stacks of plates together and tries dancing his way to the cabinets with a huge stack of dishes . The predictable disaster happens and Honey chews him out , but Bosko sees a headline about robots and decides to build one to do his work for him . So he rapidly builds a robot out of items he just happens to find laying around and builds his own " mechanical man " . He starts it up and it promptly goes berserk ! This is where most of the really visually interesting gags come from in the short . The animation on the robot is very good and watching it crash through Honey's house taking out door after door ( with Bosko trapped between two of them ) is quite effective . Honey briefly stops the rampage by spraying perfume on the robot , which then starts prancing around and tearing off sheets from a roll of bathroom tissue . This stops when it sees Bosko and it goes after him again . Honey then sticks a record player ( with a copy of " Mary Had a Little Lamb " on the turntable ) into the robot and it calms down again-until the record sticks and it goes nuts again . It chases Honey and Bosko out the front door , startling Bruno , who runs after them when the robot shocks him . Bosko ends the chase ( and the short ) when he hurls a bomb into the robot's mouth and blows it up . This has some very nice animation and is a nice finish to the series at Warner Brothers . I hope that it winds up on a future Looney Tunes Golden Collection . Recommended .
579444	583640	56545	6.0	This would have been helped greatly by less Ludwig and more music .	This cartoon was nominated for an Oscar and the only reason that I can see is because it was released by Disney . It's at least 2-5 minutes too long , has not nearly enough music and too much Ludwig von Drake ( a character I normally like , but here , for some reason , he's like fingernails on a chalkboard ) . Disney's done much better work in the same vein , like Toot , Whistle , Plunk and Boom . Here , Drake's commentary is unfunny and excessive . Disney runs this during Vault Disney occasionally-not too often , though . Has it's moments . Probably worth seeing if you like Disney .
579499	583640	63433	6.0	I found the camel most annoying !	This is a marginal short partially salvaged by an interesting ending . There will be mild spoilers in the portion which follows : The Pink Pather is looking for artifacts and / or jewels in Egypt . He goes to buy a camel , but has little money and has to settle for a small camel that behaves as if it were a dog . The old saying truly holds here-he got what he paid for , which wasn't much . In spots , it reminds me all too much of the horse in Pinto Pink and other shorts The little camel causes the Pink Panther no end of trouble and gets chased away more than once here . There are a couple of interesting gags involving water in one way or another , with the strange sight of a camel guzzling a canteen being the most unusual . The Pink Panther has a few experiences with explosives here and finally manages to get into a crypt-one with a warning of a curse on anyone who enters . He grabs a large gem and begins running , only to periodically change into things-a rat , a lizard , etc . Not the greatest short , but it's only six minutes long and it does have a few moments which make it worth watching . It's on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , which is well worth getting .
579846	583640	150869	6.0	One of the Sing Along series Paramount / Famous Pictures did	As cartoons go , these are average , with some being good and some being poor . They tend to be very formulaic in nature . I will be discussing some details , so technically this is a spoiler warning ( though I'm not spoiling much ) : This particular short is a pretty basic example of a Sing Along cartoon . They start out with about three and a half minutes of gags , mostly sight gags , built around a central theme ( here , it's Indians ) , then a character does a song intro and tells the audience to sing along and " just follow the bouncing ball " . The next roughly two minutes or so has a bouncing ball tracking the song lyrics in time with a chorale singing of whatever song is highlighted - " My Pony Boy " here - with the second verse and chorus having some rudimentary animation in addition to the bouncing ball . When the singing ends , there's a tail end to the cartoon that's usually one lengthy bit between one and two minutes long . In this one , there's the obligatory gag about the " Cleveland Indians " , with a bunch of Indians in baseball uniforms and Big Chief " Rain-In-the-Face " shows up-that's another standard joke . There are a few decent gags here , but most of it would have been trite and repetitive even back in 1949 . The singing bits are the best part of this one . It has a few moments and is worth seeing , but it's just an average cartoon and is most decidedly full of stereotypical humor .
578938	583640	23836	7.0	Entertaining in spots , though wildly uneven	This short has a very good beginning , bogs down a bit in the middle and has an enjoyable ending . Since I will be discussing details , this is a spoiler warning : Bosko is the host / organist of a movie house . He leads the audience in a singalong and at the end pulls two knobs on the organ-one sounds like a duck call and the other pulls out on a chain and you hear a flushing sound ! Next is what has got to be the dullest spoof of a newsreel that I have ever seen in any cartoon I've ever watched-the gag title was very apt : the spoof title was " Out-of-Tone News " and the sole truly memorable bit was where caricatures of the Four Marx Brothers were chasing after a dog with nets . Sadder still is a ( thankfully ) very brief parody of Laurel and Hardy which was painfully unfunny . This middle part drags badly . Then comes the " feature " and the cartoon gets interesting . It's a melodrama , with Honey as the star . She's shown riding a bicycle to the tune of " Bicycle Built For Two " . She's followed by a return of the Marx Brothers on a four-seater . The typical melodrama villain is also on a bike ( I think-it's difficult to say for certain ) and he grabs Honey and rides off with her . They wind up on a train and Honey is calling frantically for help . Bosko is growing more agitated watching this and finally shouts , " I'll save you , Honey ! " and jumps into and through the screen ! This is an enjoyable and entertaining short . I hope it ultimately sees release on a future volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection series . Recommended .
579023	583640	152037	7.0	Unusual " cheater " redeemed by a good ending .	This is the first of three rather atypical " cheater " cartoons , which use footage from three Popeyes produced in the 1930s by Fleischer Brothers Studios but frame the footage with roughly two or three minutes of new animation done by Famous Studios ! As there is less distance in time between this pairing ( Aladdin and his Magic Lamp was the third Popeye " special " , done in 1938 , while this short was one in 1949 ) and , at the time , Famous Studios still had some spark of creativity , the gap between old and new material was not as notable , although the sheer magic of Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor makes Big Bad Sinbad slightly better than Popeye's Premiere . This one works better as a unit , though , with the framing material of better quality and with a fairly decent plot . The ending is certainly the most imaginative of the three . By the early 1950s , Famous Studios was going through the motions and it really shows . I think that this cartoon marks the beginning of the end , at least for Popeye . For completeists and major Popeye fans only .
579474	583640	30520	7.0	Interesting , but flawed , as the series was overall	The problems with taking a known source material from one medium and attempting to translate it to another are manifold . Aside from a built-in fan base for the original work ready to pounce with sometimes malicious glee on the adaptation and tear it to shreds with flensing knives , there is the definite prospect that the adaptation doesn't work well between the differing media . From static media to active media ( i . e . , print to film ) the transition requirements are challenging , to say the least . As far as animation goes , Betty Boop and Popeye made the leap successfully and Der Captain and the Kids did not , in part for the same reasons : the Fleischer Studio seemed to understand the source material better than MGM did Der Captain and the Kids , for one thing . But more importantly , Betty Boop and Popeye are more dynamic personalities with greater room to grow in the new medium , while Der Captain and the Kids had characters that were less dynamic and more stereotypical and thus gave the animators and writers less to work with . Ironically , the best proof of this comes from the pre-Code and post-Code changes in Betty Boop . As Betty's personality and trademarks were slowly erased to make her tamer and come in line with the Code , the shorts became more mediocre . Der Captain and the Kids , without that much to work with to begin with ( ethnic characters tend to become one-note quickly unless the writers and directors have an excellent feel for the material ) , forced the studio to resort to other means and materials to make shorts work , as the main characters were limited . The fatal error was focusing all too much on Der Captain , the character who works least well on screen , being more one-dimensional to start with . The horse , Smokey , is a more fully developed character than anyone else in the short and far more interesting than Der Captain , who is more caricature than character and gets what little character he has from Billy Bletcher's voice work . Good , but far from great , short with a few moments . Worth watching , but nothing special .
579329	583640	30589	7.0	Visually impressive in spots , if way too cute for its own good in others .	This is an interesting take on the perils of smoking ( done some 65 years ago ) and is a very nice cartoon , particularly some of the visual sequences . But the cartoon is entirely too precious in spots for its own good . It isn't a bad cartoon , but the dichotomy of cute one moment and eerie the next is far too great a gulf for this short to work very well . Roger Corman pulled it off in some of his features simply by shooting for humor rather than sugary sweet , as they do here . Worth watching , though . Recommended to fans of the MGM Harman / Ising days .
579511	583640	54720	7.0	Sylvester is particularly unfortunate in this short	This short has Sylvester once again trying to catch Speedy , this time in order to prevent him stealing cheese from the store he's protecting . In reality , it's Sylvester himself who needs protection-from himself and Speedy ! As I want to discuss this short in some detail , this is a spoiler warning : The short opens with two mice sleeping in a sardine can . As Jose and Manuel wake up , they begin to ponder where breakfast is coming from , each in turn trying to suggest something , only to have the other shoot the idea down before they even finish . This bit has a beautiful finish , with the two saying ( in unison ) " How about . . . ? " and then simultaneously saying " No ! " They then spot a " Cheese party " being thrown by Mayor Raton , but they are tossed out by the Mayor himself . So they watch from the wall instead . Catastrophe strikes when the " Cheese Committee " comes in looking rather battered and they tell the mayor there's no cheese because there's a new cat . Manuel and Jose offer to summon Speedy to get the cheese-for a favor , to which the mayor agrees . This starts a very bad day for Sylvester . First , Sylvester tries to stop Speedt by simply blocking him , only to have Speedy run under him so fast that it strips him of fur and leaves the words , " Speedy was here ! " spelled out on Sylvester's stomach with what's left of his fur . Adding insult to injury , Speedy does the same thing on his way out , across his behind , this time spelling , " Also Here ! " . Sylvester then tries to lay a series of traps , all of which backfire , including spreading tacks , trying to use a cannon and filling a room with mousetraps . This last is particularly ill-conceived , as Sylvester winds up cornered by his own traps and Speedy then tosses in a ping pong ball to trigger a massive chain reaction . The only one with regrets after any of this is Sylvester . Speedy gets enough cheese to save the fiesta , is given a medal by the grateful mayor and Jose and Manuel get " jobs " as the official " Cheese Inspectors " . Speedy , however , gets the last laugh , as he's been appointed " Chick Inspector " and is last seen with a pretty senorita mouse at his side and a rather large grin ! This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth seeing . Recommended .
579596	583640	30280	7.0	The first Tex Avery travelogue spoof and Egghead too !	This short is the first of several spoofs of the travelogue shorts popular at the time that showcased exotic locales for movie audiences . While a good cartoon , not on a par with later ones such as Detouring America or Crazy Cruise . Avery was still finding his range on the material . Still some good stuff here anyway . This one features Egghead in a running gag that has a funny finish . Enjoyable and entertaining , it's well worth hunting down . Recommended
579402	583640	50236	7.0	One of two unusual " cheater " cartoons to re-use Tex Avery shorts long after he'd left MGM	This is an unusual cartoon , in that it's an example of a " cheater " ( a cartoon which incorporates animation from earlier cartoons , in order to save time and money while still meeting the required running time and schedule for animated shorts ) taken to the extreme . Because I want to discuss the short a bit , this is a spoiler warning : This short is , in essence , a cartoon directed by Tex Avery in 1950 , one called The Ventriloquist Cat . What they did was take the original animation , re-use it against new backgrounds , changed the cat from black to orange and shoot it in a widescreen format . Given that a large chunk of the work was already done , they probably did this because the studio wanted to make use of the widescreen process on their animated shorts as well and this was an easy way to get experience at making such cartoons , while keeping on schedule and at or under budget . If you've seen Ventriloquist Cat , you've seen Cat's Meow , at least for all practical purposes . They did this same thing to another Avery short , taking a Droopy short entitled From Wags To Riches , making very few modifications and releasing it in widescreen as Millionaire Droopy . If you really like Tex Avery ( I do ) then this is worth seeing .
578838	583640	30034	7.0	Two early appearances of well-known characters	This short features a very early version of Daffy Duck ( call it Daffy 1 . 0 ) and also Egghead , who would evolve into Elmer Fudd a bit later on . This features one of the zaniest duels of all time ! The turtle almost steals the show here ! Typical Tex Avery sight gags . A bit more talky than the aerage Avery short , but very good . Well worth seeing . Recommended .
579448	583640	92105	7.0	Not their best teaming , but Lancaster and Douglas work well together	This is a rather light comedy , not an exceptional film , but entertaining enough . While Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster turn in engaging performances , the movie is stolen by Eli Wallach , whose character is nothing if not persistent ! There are some very funny bits here . If you're looking for something light , funny and enjoyable , this one works . Worth watching .
578890	583640	20880	7.0	The first cartoon released from the Ub Iwerks studio , as well as the introduction of Flip the Frog	This is the first cartoon produced by the studio Ub Iwerks started after he departed Disney . This short also features Flip the Frog , who would " star " in roughly half of the theatrical releases done under the Iwerks imprint in its lifetime as an independent studio ( there was at least one short produced that was never released to theaters ) , there being 38 Flips and about 75 or 76 total shorts altogether . This first short ( oddly , in color , when most of the Flips were black and white ) points up the strengths and weaknesses of the series as a whole-technically it is excellent , but the character is drab and void of personality and there is no plot to speak of here . It's a good cartoon and enjoyable to watch , but not truly memorable or special . Ub Iwerks was interested in visuals for the most part and I don't think he had Disney's touch with character or story . When the visuals were paramount and depth of character or plot was irrelevant or even possibly undesirable , you have a masterpiece , such as The Skeleton Dance . When they would be of some benefit , but are somewhat lacking , you get the average Flip the Frog . Given the personnel Iwerks employed-a veritable Who's Who of future talents-and the quality of some of the individual bits and pieces , it's a bit sad when you realize that , with a bit more flair , the output of the studio could have gone from average to good and instead could have been good to outstanding . Still worth seeing and I'm glad that the bulk of it is in print . The animation alone makes it worth seeing . Carl W . Stallings ' music doesn't hurt . Worth the effort to see at least once . Recommended for fans of animation and ( with a few exceptions ) good fun for children .
578856	583640	150603	7.0	A turtle wants to fly and gets his wish-sort of .	This is a cute little uncomplicated cartoon about a turtle who wants to fly more than anything . Because I want to talk about a few details , this is a spoiler warning : Herman the Turtle dreams of flying , reads books on the subject and is teased about it by birds , including a bald eagle . He even tries taking flying lessons and building himself some wings . He ultimately winds up underwater , where he finds a treasure chest . He bribes the eagle to take him up in the air so that he can fly . There are some really good visual gags in the sequence where the eagle takes him up , with the turtle always saying " Higher ! " whenever the eagle asks him if the altitude is good enough . Finally , the eagle says , " End of the line " and drops Herman off . Herman grabs two of the eagle's tail feathers and starts flapping his arms furiously . Unfortunately for him , it doesn't work very well for him at all and he drops rapidly to meet the ground . The narrator announces Herman's demise in somber tones as the scene shifts upward to " Turtle Heaven " and we see Herman flying with angel's wings and happy as a clam . This is available on one of the Columbia House DVDs and is well worth watching . Recommended .
578801	583640	141912	7.0	Rather fascinating animated sing-along which more or less fits the animated story to the song	This short actually has a story in the animated portion which more or less leads into the song itself . Because I want to discuss the short , there will be spoilers below : The short opens with an animated sequence featuring a dog-like creature in uniform stopping by to see a girl . There are some nice musically-oriented bits ( a piece of gate used like a harp , for one ) and the soldier winds up in the girl's room . Meanwhile , the commander uses his horse to call his unit , the soldier doesn't go and is arrested and put to labor , breaking stones with a hammer , deriving some musical bits there , notes placed in time with blows on the rock from the hammer . He also reduces a rock in size and makes it into the " bouncing ball " to cue the lyrics of the title song , which can be related to the basic story . There's some incidental animation of marching soldiers during the sing-along and the short is quite effective overall . Recommended .
579410	583640	62010	7.0	Rarely do I feel sympathy for Daffy , but I do in this one !	Daffy is rarely what I would call a sympathetic character , but here , to a large degree , he is a most sympathetic character indeed . Just looking for peace and quiet and bothering no one , he is bombarded at all turns by possibly the most insipid tune ever heard in cartoons and certainly ever heard in a Warner Brothers short ! Ten minutes of that might have made Mother Teresa commit murder ! Good cartoon with okay animation and an awful score . You have been warned ! Recommended , with the caveat above .
579034	583640	73402	7.0	A most unusual piece of work	This is one of the oddest and most unusual shorts that I've ever seen and I'm still not entirely certain what the point was ( or even if there was one to start with ) in this particular case . Produced by the National Film Board of Canada , this was nominated for an Academy Award and uses a type of stop-motion animation that reminds me of the work of Norman McLaren . Recommended for anyone who likes unusual animation .
579723	583640	20488	7.0	Notable principally for Norma Shearer	The movie has a somewhat overheated , strained quality to it , much like a soap opera and is primarily of interest for Norma Shearer's performance , which received a nomination for Best Actress for the 1929-30 Academy Awards , which she lost to herself , winning instead for her performance in The Divorcee , a better role in a much better film . Ms . Shearer was THE actress at the time and did quite well for many years . A good movie that could have been better and largely a curio now .
579060	583640	142106	7.0	Reasonably good short , ostensibly starring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , though he's not in it very much	This is a black and white short done by the Lantz Studios , part of a series featuring a character named Oswald the Lucky Rabbit . I will be discussing some detail , so this is a spoiler warning : The short opens with a group of ducks-Papa , Mama and five baby ducks-four white and one black-strolling onto the beach . This is followed shortly by a scene showing Oswald and his dog setting up on the beach . Oswald puts his dog in charge of watching their lunch , in a large picnic basket , warning of dire consequences if anything should happen to " the lunch " . The five little ducks spot " the lunch " and decide that they want it for themselves . The little black duck is the one with the most resourcefulness and is the brains of the outfit , with most of the effort and ideas coming from him . Several efforts are made to get the basket and its contents , until they finally succeed in taking the basket out to sea . The dog swims out after them , but the little black duck ( who's doing all the work here ) tricks him into believing that a shark's after him and he races back to shore . Meanwhile , an octopus spots the ducks and manages to catch them and the Papa duck tries unsuccessfully to save them . It's up to the dog to swim to the rescue . After a struggle with the octopus , what has to be the best animated sequence takes place where the dog emerges victorious . I won't describe the gag , which is excellent and probably the funniest bit in the short . As the dog brings the ducks and basket safely to the shore , where the two older ducks and Oswald ( who suddenly re-appears after being gone much of the cartoon ) cheer the rescue . The closing gag is cute , if predictable . This short is on the DVD Attack of the ' 30s Characters and is well worth checking out . Recommended .
579697	583640	80351	8.0	A very good short that has the seeds for two great ones planted within its fertile soil ( SPOILERS )	All Nothing was Frédérîc Back's first Academy Award nominee and is a very good short which might be more highly regarded if Back had not gone on to make both The Man Who Planted Trees and The Mighty River , the early genesis of which can be seen in All Nothing , as well as Crac ! , one of two Academy Award winners for Back ( the other being Man Who Planted Trees ) . Thus , three great animated shorts make a highly intelligent and thought provoking short disappear somewhat into the background . In print and available on A Tribute To Frédéric Back I cannot talk at all about the short itself without getting into specifics and I want to discuss it for various reasons , so the comment from the next paragraph on will contain spoilers . This is all subjective and other viewers may not see it the same , but I was fascinated by the fact that the short shows a creator who , in effect , incorporates evolution into the design for the planet . There are many examples of this , such as birds changing into other species of birds and other animals changing form and appearance , but the most profound use is on the humans , who go through stages-first form to aquatic , then to hairy primates , then avian life and finally to man . Interestingly , in the latter stages , man is also seen as grumbling , complaining and obnoxious . Man then becomes the extreme predator , to the creator's dismay and later anger . Man the predator then kills the creator and proceeds to do whatever he likes to the planet and other life on it without thought or consideration . At the end , man is no more satisfied and is just as empty and unhappy as before , until a final reconciliation occurs , Most recommended .
579564	583640	409799	8.0	Entertaining , if not earthshaking	This was the " weakest " of the five nominees for the Live-Action Short category bestowed by AMPAS , which means it was only very good in a field of excellent shorts . Because I want to discuss the short in a little detail , there will be spoilers : The basic premise is that people who work on the clock at a supermarket during the late shift all have different ways to make the time seem to go by more quickly , ranging from just not looking at the clock through simply goofing off to the most extreme , which is pretending that you've cause time and all movement but your own to come to a full stop . Along the way , we meet a female checkout clerk , the overbearing and absolutely tedious supervisor who keeps trying to impress her ( in vain ) , two arrested development cases , who are 22 going on 12 and the narrator , who is the one who makes time pass by acting like he's stopped it cold . Oh yeah-he also likes to sketch the female shoppers ( at least the prettier ones ) in the nude . His narration is generally entertaining and often funny . It's an entertaining short which may actually make a better feature , as it feels a tad constrained by its brevity . All in all , a good short and well worth watching . This short is available on a compilation DVD containing eight of ten nominees for the two Academy Awards Shorts categories ( two of the Animated Short nominees aren't included ) and it's a very good DVD indeed . Recommended .
579938	583640	47867	8.0	A battle of wits between Donald Duck and Humphrey-both woefully unarmed !	This short is a battle of wits . To be more accurate , it's a battle of half-wits and largely comes out a draw , though Humphrey could technically be called the bigger loser . As neither would ever be mistaken for a member of MENSA , their schemes and machinations don't go as planned . Delightful cartoon that's well worth seeking out , it plays periodically on The Ink and Paint Club . Recommended .
579239	583640	99171	8.0	Good , but nothing terribly exceptional .	Though this is a good , enjoyable cartoon , they did much better ones later on , like Carrotblanca . This is almost like the first Star Trek feature , which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what , just for existing . This is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches , but nothing special . Reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless . Available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits . Recommended .
579841	583640	63437	8.0	Androcles and the Lion , anyone ?	The plot of this one is similar in some respects to Androcles and the Lion-though far more humorous . As I intend to discuss this cartoon in a bit of detail , there will be spoilers : The primary character opposite the Pink Panther in a great many of these shorts is a little white guy with a mustache , said to be patterned on Friz Freleng , a noted animator / director and one of the producers of the series . He often takes on a role specific to the plot of the short . Here , for example , he is a playboy type . He pulls a nail out of the Pink Panther's foot and thus wins a friend . He rapidly becomes disenchanted with the PP's enthusiastic gratitude and tries to lose him-until he gets home and his wife and mother-in-law are waiting up-bearing a rolling-pin . Enter his new-found friend and now protector , the Pink Panther , who scares the daylights out of the wife and causes the mother-in-law to leave . The middle portion of the short is the little guy taking full advantage of his new " weapon " and his wife's efforts to get rid of the Pink Panther . Finally , in frustration , she nails up a note telling hubby that she's " going home to mother " and walks out . Our hero goes to see if she's leaving and winds up with a nail in his foot , which the wife pulls out , reversing the dynamic . She's now the beneficiary of gratitude and celebrates this by breaking bottles over her husband's head . Ah , the joys of karma ! This short is available on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is well worth checking out . Recommended .
578840	583640	21685	8.0	Entertaining , unremarkable short featuring an all but forgotten character	Bosko is largely a forgotten character by most people , if they ever knew of him in the first place . The fact that the cartoons are rarely seen accounts for this and he is rarely seen in part because of a perception that black and white shorts are of little interest and in part because of a feeling that the character is stereotypical in nature and thus offensive . So shorts that are entertaining , if unspectacular , are effectively buried when they shouldn't be . Well worth seeking out . Recommended .
579017	583640	52427	8.0	Superb Special Effects , courtesy George Pal , but Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas almost steal the movie	This movie deservedly won the Oscar for its Special Effects . Russ Tamblyn was well-cast as tom . The romantic sub-plot is superfluous and Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers all but steal the movie as a bumbling pair of thieves . Funny enjoyable puffball of a movie . Well worth watching for the effects and Sellers and Thomas .
579963	583640	23783	8.0	Bosko in the Foreign Legion	This is a very good Bosko short , with some very good sight gags and some hilarious segments . I want to discuss this short in some detail , so this is a spoiler warning : Most Bosko shorts tend to have a few really good gags in an otherwise dull and uneven cartoon . Quite often , there will be one notable section which works fairly well . This one , however , is fairly solid from start to finish , with memorably funny gags spread out through the whole of the short . It starts with a view of the sleeping quarters of a Foreign Legion outpost , with some nice sight gags . When reveille sounds , the mean Sargent comes in , to be serenaded with a child-like , sing-song rendition of " Good Morning To You " ! Bosko's uniform stands to before Bosko wakes up to the bugle's call and must wake Bosko itself . They ( Bosko and his uniform ) run out to stand inspection , where Bosko does his morning ablutions standing in ranks ! He's called forward and given the assignment to capture Ali Oop ( no mention is made of a dinosaur ) . The next part has Bosko riding a camel and gets the typical gags in any Foreign Legion cartoon-the oasis , other people comically riding camels , the snake charmer ( with a jazzy snake ) and so on . Bosko sees Honey just in time to be with her when Ali Oop storms the village ( naturally , as it speeds things up when you don't have to hunt for the bad guy ) and the battle sequence starts , with the jokes being sight gags related to people shooting at one another . I won't spoil those , because they have to be seen to be appreciated . The short ends with Bosko getting the girl and capturing Oop . The capture of Ali Oop is effective and funny . I hope this eventually see release on a future Looney Tunes Golden Collection . Most recommended .
579425	583640	85936	8.0	Good , if typical , Disney adaptatin of a classic tale	Nominated for an Academy Award , this is a good , though not great , adaptation of Dickens as seen through the lense of Disney . Better than average re-telling of A Christmas Carol , though the Disney hand is visible a bit heavily in spots . Enjoyable , if far from a masterpiece . Recommended .
579266	583640	41655	8.0	Good short with some excellent lines and I'm glad to see it in print !	This is a short which I haven't seen in ages , as it was declared off-limits by Ted Turner when Turner acquired the rights to the shorts . While I can understand his trepidation , I'm grateful to finally see the short again , because it has one of the funniest scenes I remember from watching these close to 40 years ago . As I want to talk about the short in a bit of detail , this is a spoiler warning : The short starts with a scene which likely helped pull it from circulation for years-blacks working in the cotton fields , one of whom grabs Bugs's " cotton " tail and tosses him in the sack . We then watch Bugs make his way from field-sack to cotton bale bound for the Southern Star , a paddle-wheel on the Mississippi , bound for all sorts of ports , including " Cu-cka-mong-a " ( an old inside joke Mel Blanc has fun with in quite a few shorts ) . Bugs happens to observe what happens to stowaways on board and so " borrows " a gentleman's suit ( and presumably his ticket as well ) . This scene is hilarious . Bugs then winds up in a card game with Colonel Shuffle ( think Yosemite Sam with a Southern accent ) . Bugs puts up $100 , which buys one half of a white chip , Col . Shuffle deals and the scene fades out . The fade in shows Bugs with a mountain of chips and Shuffle with half a white chip . Bugs wins the hand , with both players cheating . Shuffle contrives to be insulted and challenges Bugs to a duel . A few very funny bits later , Shuffle winds up in the Mississippi River to start a running gag and the chase is on . In a short with some very funny bits , my personal favorite comes after Col . Shuffle has set his pants on fire in the ship's furnace . He races to a water dispenser which takes only pennies and turns to Bugs , asking in very courtly speech if he might have change for a " tenspot " , adding that " I would prefer a profusion of pennies ! " . Bugs slowly checks the bill over ( he bites it at one point ) and slowly begins counting change . When he reaches $1 . 21 , Shuffle grabs the change , thanks him , tells him he can keep the rest and buys a cup of water and finally puts himself out . Bugs disguises himself as a Southern belle and begins whacking Shuffle with an umbrella , with Shuffle apologizing abjectly ( and futilely ) until he discovers it's Bugs . Bugs as a belle persuades a Southern gentleman to kick Shuffle off into the river again . When the gentleman realizes the " belle " is a bunny , he exits jerkily , stage right , into the river himself . The closing line is perfect . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth seeing . Recommended .
579259	583640	141299	8.0	Od , but interesting , sing-along short from Fleischer	This is an odd little entry from Fleischer in their Screen Song sing-along series . About half animation , half sing-along and a little hard to describe . Because I want to discuss some details , this is a spoiler warning : There really isn't all that much to this one . It starts out with mice taking buckets of water and splashing them on an elephant bathing behind a screen and just kind of goes on from there . Either mice are scrubbing other animals or the animals are washing themselves . There are two bits which I particularly like-one where a mouse is bathing cats using a tub and washboard , like a laundrywoman and a bit where a mouse , trying to get a sleeping dog to continue cranking a water-pump , pulls a pair of dice from his pocket and they morph into a bone ( a slang expression for dice is " bones " ) . After the cleaning finishes , a rather odd rabbit assembles the animals into an orchestra and then very exaggeratedly tells the audience that they will be playing the title tune and encourages the audience to sing along by following the " bouncing ball " . There follows the standard lyric display , though the last part features the rabbit in place of the ball and the words change as he steps on them . The animation is nice , though the song is rather melancholy and the singing is uninspired . Worth tracking down .
579281	583640	25807	8.0	Some great visuals and a few really funny sight gags make this worth watching .	This is a really funny early Popeye , with some really excellent visual effects . Swee ' Pea is making life most unhappy for all concerned-himself , Popeye and all the poor souls Popeye silences in order for the little noisemaker to stay asleep ( a consummation devoutly to be wished ) and thus to be silent . Costello is okay as Popeye here , though he never really did very well in my view . I'm not sure he understood the character terribly well . All in all , a fairly good cartoon largely consisting of sight gags of a fairly violent nature . Good early effort and worth seeing . Recommended .
579242	583640	43341	8.0	Enjoyable cartoon , with Bruno the Bear the comic attraction	Bugs Bunny always works best when he has a suitably obnoxious opponent and he has one here in Bruno the Magnificent , a vain and egotistical bear who most definitely wants the spotlight all to himself . Enter our hero , stage left , and a series of standard sight gags and some good lines . I loved this cartoon growing up and I'm glad it's in print . Cute short that's worth looking for . Recommended .
579576	583640	146460	8.0	Visually impressive , with excellent voice work by Billy Bletcher .	This is a visually impressive cartoon , which should be expected from an Iwerks cartoon . As plots go , this was actually a pretty intricate one for the Iwerks studio , with a great villain voiced by a Disney regular , Billy Bletcher , who did Pegleg Pete , among others . The funniest bit for me was the town's " alarm " system . The Pincushion Man is really the most interesting character in the short , but it does offer some entertaining moments and is genuinely tense and frightening in spots . Iwerks deserves more notice and credit for what he had a responsibility for at Disney . His stint running his own studio wasn't as successful as he would have hoped , but he did produce ( with an incredibly talented team , as a glance at the names of his employees will attest ) some very good shorts . Balloon Land is one of the best that the Iwerks Studio created . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579110	583640	29708	8.0	Early Tex Avery short that is infrequently seen these days	This short is a fairly typical Tex Avery short that is one of two spoofs he did of the book Uncle Tom's Cabin ( the other was Uncle Tom's Cabana for MGM ) and while this short really is rather innocuous and there isn't anything that bad here , it would probably offend some sensibilities and is consequently rarely seen in this day and age . Which is too bad , as it is a very good cartoon . Placed in context , it could probably be shown , but the reaction would be loud and immediate enough that it likely won't happen . Worth seeking out . Recommended .
578866	583640	22031	8.0	Very early Betty Boop and a very earthy performance from Rudy Vallee	This short is actually part of the Screen Songs series that were done by Fleischer Studios as part of the once extremely popular sing-alongs that were part and parcel of a night out at the movies , long before television . Think of them as early forms of today's music videos . Listen to the song Rudy Vallee sings , in particular to the spoken jokes between choruses . Some of the may surprise you ! This is very early Betty Boop , so she doesn't look quite the same as she did later . This could accurately be described as a formative cartoon for Betty Boop . Well worth watching . In print and available . Recommended .
579855	583640	53425	8.0	Oscar nominee from the year of my birth .	This short , most accurately titled , was released the year I was born . About a man who plays the violin with great enthusiasm , if with limited ability . Charming and engaging , with a good story and dialogue to go along with a limited animation style . Ernest Pintoff had a light touch with comedy and made some very delightful shorts in the late 1950s and early 1960s . I wish he'd done more of them . Well worth tracking down . Most recommended .
579847	583640	34051	8.0	Porky the trainer and the jockey in this one	This short is similar to Porky and Teabiscuit in some respects and wildly different in others . As I will be discussing details here , consider this a spoiler warning : In this short , as in Porky and Teabiscuit , the action takes place at a racetrack and both feature very unlikely horses in a race . Porky is the jockey in both shorts . Otherwise , except for a few other relatively minor points , they are quite different . For one thing , Porky is a child in Teabiscuit and an adult here . For another , Porky is definitely second fiddle here to the horse . My favorite bit in here is when Porky is singing different lyrics set to the tune to " We're In the Money " . The lyrics are actually quite good . The race itself is very well animated , with some very nice detail work . At one point , the speed lines for Porky's horse coalesce themselves into the outline of a locomotive ! Much of the short is taken up with sight gags arising from the horse trying to convince Porky that he really can be a good steeplechaser ! Things generally go comically awry with the horse's attempts to impress Porky . All in all , some really nice gags make this an enjoyable short . Porky and Teabiscuit has been released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection ( Volume 3 , if I remember correctly ) and hopefully this one will make one in the future . Worth finding . Recommended .
579422	583640	37912	8.0	Surprisingly good sort for a rather bland series	At the risk of sounding heretical , I've always found the character of Mighty Mouse rather bland and , wel , boring . This short is actually rather creative and one of the better entries in the series . It was nominated for an Academy Award and has fairly good music and the production values may just be a hair better than typical Paul Terry standards . Check it out if you can find it anywhere . Worth watching .
579722	583640	109873	8.0	Mostly animated strips from Larson's " The Far Side " .	The cartoon is a series of strips that have been animated or in one or two cases , individual strips have been expanded from the original single panel and extended somewhat to draw out the gag . Anyone who read " The Far Side " pretty much knows what to expect . All of Larson's basic standards-cows . bears , et cetera-are here in all their glory . If you like Larson , you'll like this .
579597	583640	40415	8.0	Funny , but an odd cartoon , even for a Tex Avery	This short is quite funny , but it's an odd one , even for Avery . Part of a series of shorts featuring two characters called George and Junior , most of this centers around the activity of a very small pygmy , somewhat reminiscent of Inki from the Warner Brothers shorts . Unlikely to be in general release due to caricatures , it is worth hunting down nonetheless . Recommended .
579300	583640	33909	8.0	Popeye the Sailor enlists !	This is the first Popeye to show him in navy whites as Popeye enlists in the navy and discovers that there are four ways to do things : the right way , the wrong way , my way and the Navy way , with the Navy way being the way the Navy wants things done , naturally . Popeye has trouble with this at first , but gradually comes to loathe it in time ! Great fun and well worth watching . Recommended .
579294	583640	31343	8.0	Early Tex Avery finger exercise	I admit I'm biased in Tex Avery's favor and never saw an Avery cartoon I didn't like . In this one , Avery was still finding his style . There are a few more coughs and sputters here than is typical of Avery , but even with that said , his average work is as good as or better than some directors ' best work . Even Rembrandt had his off days . So did Shakespeare , I like this cartoon myself , but others may not . Worth watching . Recommended for Avery fans , certainly .
579236	583640	109629	8.0	This is sick , twisted and depraved-in other words , very funny !	This short , brought to you by the man who developed Courage the Cowardly Dog , no less , is like what I would expect a collaboration between Tex Avery and R . Crumb to look like , if they were both doing copious amounts of caffinated beverages , that is ! It's even lewder than Avery and moves about as fast ( nobody does Avery as fast-or as funny-as the man himself , though countless animators have tried . This is perfect for Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted , but I got it on the generally tamer Festival of Animation , Vol 3 . It's an excellent tape , well worth getting . As for Dirdy Birdy , if you are easily offended , you may want to pass on this short , because your head might explode ! Recommended to anyone who likes Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted . Anyone else , it may be too much for you to handle !
579322	583640	29154	8.0	One of many takes on the old fairy tale , Little Red Riding Hood , done by Tex Avery and others	Tex Avery and other animators must have liked this fairy tale , because it was used frequently as the basis for a number of cartoons . Avery himself did more than one , this one and a couple he did at MGM , as well as using it as a brief gag elsewhere in other shorts . Fairy tales were commonly used by animators as the jumping-off point for cartoons . This one features Egghead in a running gag seen throughout the short . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579607	583640	63573	8.0	An enjoyable , light comedy	I admit this is not the best thing Paul Newman has done . But it's an entertaining little comedy that is charming and quirky in its own special way . There are plenty of familiar faces , particularly if you watched lots of television in the ' 60's and ' 70's . A move that's a bit rough around the edges but still well worth watching on it's own merits .
579061	583640	151147	8.0	How do I describe The Little King ?	This is one of a relatively small series of shorts done by the Van Beuren Studios which starred a comic strip character named The Little King . It's a reasonably good short , but it's difficult to describe . Because I will be discussing some details , this is a spoiler warning : The Little King is a difficult character to describe because , in many ways , he's very bland and unexciting . In general , he doesn't speak ( the only short I've seen where he does speak was a Fleischer Studios appearance in a Betty Boop short and the voice is a bit ridiculous ) . He's very child-like , almost to the point of being annoying . In this short , he has a trip scheduled to visit the state prison . The funniest part of the short is his preparations to go to the prison and the trip there . He's aided by a butler to get ready and then slides down a long bannister , at one point getting off to allow the butler to get ahead of him in sliding down in order to catch him when he reaches the bottom ( the butler misses him ) . On the way to the prison , the Little King gets distracted by flowers and winds up falling out the window of the carriage . He tries hitching a ride , finally finding a bicyclist who carries him on his head until they reach the carriage , where the coachman and footman are searching under and around the carriage in vain for their king . Everything-Little King , bike , cyclist-goes into the carriage and off they go . When they reach the prison , the Little King is allowed to wander off on his own and he finds two inmates playing a game of checkers . He suggests a move to one which naturally causes him to lose the game immediately , whereupon the inmate breaks out of his cell and begins chasing the king , who timidly gives him the keys to the prison . The obvious happens and a riot breaks out . The ending is a bit predictable , but still cute anyway . This short is well worth seeing and can be found on the DVD The Attack of the ' 30s Characters . Recommended .
579057	583640	30592	9.0	Jack Mercer made Popeye funnier	The character of Popeye was entertaining enough early on in the Fleischer Studios days , when William Costello was doing vocal duties . But the real spark that made Popeye special was when Jack Mercer took over . Mercer started as part of the animation team and then became the voice of Popeye . The choice of Mercer was perfect , because Mercer basically created Popeye's personality , particularly with the mutterings and under the breath asides Popeye would make that were usually funnier than the principal dialogue . Plumbing Is a " Pipe " is an excellent example of this aspect of the Popeye shorts voiced by Mercer . Listen for Mercer's remarks throughout the final four or five minutes of this one . That , and the fact that Wimpy is a " plumber " , are hilarious and make this worth tracking down . Most recommended .
579185	583640	149688	9.0	Be careful what you ask for-you just might get it !	This short is a remake of a Fleischer Studios effort , the title of which escapes me at the moment , and is impressive enough that it can hold its own against the earlier cartoon , not often the case with Famous Studio work . Lots of sight gags , but the voice work is excellent . Beck was the best of the voices for Bluto over the years and Mercer and Questal were always marvelous . Bluto and Popeye fight over Olive and , as usual , Popeye wins-or does he ? You decide . Well worth tracking down . Recommended .
579508	583640	62996	9.0	The Pink Panther enlists-with obvious consequences !	This is an exceptionally funny short where the Pink Panther does for the Army and his Sargeant ( " The Little White Guy " ) what Gomer Pyle did for the Marines and Sargeant Carter . I'm going to go into some detail in this comment , so this is your spoiler warning : The scene is set when the Pink Panther sees a recruiting poster and decides to join the Army . At boot camp , enter " The little White Guy " as a basic training instructor . He takes one look at our stalwart hero and hands him a broom instead of a rifle , which was a wise decision . The Pink Panther makes for a less than exemplary soldier . Before long , the Sargeant decides that he wants to get rid of the worst recruit he has and tries a number of different ways-land-mines , a grenade , an obstacle course , et cetera-which all naturally backfire on him without so much as breaking one of the Panther's toenails . The funniest part of the short revolves around the camp mascot , a large , rather ill-tempered ( though not without cause ) bulldog which takes a pronounced dislike to the Sargeant . The funniest gag , hands down , mostly takes place off-screen . The obstacle course the Sargeant sets up for the Pink Panther to run is shown briefly in all its painful and potentially deadly glory . The pistol he fires as a signal to the Panther to start running unfortunately happens to be pointed at the dog when he pulls the trigger . The little guy runs headlong into the course , while the dog ( sensibly ) stops . The sound effects used to indicate the run through various obstacles are perfect and hysterically funny . This is repeated , of course , when he comes out at the other side only to have the bulldog " greet " him and he runs back the way he came . The close of the cartoon has the Pink Panther winding up shipped to the Navy and coming back in Navy whites and the Sargeant deciding that a change of scenery ( and branches of service ) is an excellent idea . This short is on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is well worth watching . Most recommended .
579379	583640	21664	9.0	Very strange short with a small part for an early take on Betty Boop .	This is a BImbo cartoon and quite an odd one it is too . Betty Boop makes a relatively brief appearance towards the latter half of the short and at the end and her look is slighly different in this early short . Exceedingly strange things happen throughout to say the least ! Great fun but definitely an acquired taste . In print and available . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579646	583640	93832	9.0	Deep down , do all things , great and small , dream ?	The folks at Pixar do a wonderful job here . While this isn't their best short , it is definitely a fine one and the hero here is a surprising one : a little red bike , an inanimate Walter Mitty ! I got caught up in this short . Pixar really should re-release their collection of their short films . The short work they do is all at least interesting and most of it is magnificent ! Well worth hunting up and most highly recommended .
579010	583640	53131	9.0	Good film , but overlong and with a surprisingly tepid performance by Peter Finch	The Nun's Story is a good film , well worth watching . But it's at least half-an-hour too long and at points Peter Finch seems almost bored with his role . Audrey Hepburn is very good and excellent work is done by most of the cast , particularly Dean Jagger and Edith Evans . The standout performance , however , is by Coleen Dewhurst , who is incredible as a mental patient . Good cast that , Finch being the exception , does good to great work . Well worth watching .
579338	583640	25321	9.0	Iwerks near his best on his own .	Ub Iwerks was a technical genius , but often plots and story were afterthoughts . Exceptionally visual cartoons not needing much plotting work splendidly , while those needing strong characterization , story or plot fare less well as a rule . This one is an exception to that . Visually excellent and technically superb , this is also engaging and has fascinating characters and a good plot . Iwerks was creative in his own area of expertise and one of the reasons that Iwerks and Walt Disney worked so well together was that their strengths were complementary to one another . This is Iwerks Studios near their best . Absolutely beautiful short , it's good to see this in print . Well worth getting . Recommended .
579282	583640	34077	9.0	Not so much a remake of Sock-a-bye Baby as it is a variation on a theme .	The Fleischers , toward the end of the studio's existence , for whatever reason , chose to do one or two thematically similar shorts that copied ( somewhat ) earlier shorts in the Popeye series . Given that Famous Studios practically strip-mined the old Fleischers for ideas ( and usually just pointed up how poor their shorts were in comparison ) , Max and Dave can be given some slack here . Particularly as this cartoon is perhaps slightly better , given that it has Jack Mercer and a funnier ending . The animation is superb , though the sight gags in the earlier short are more effective . Both are very good work . Well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
578826	583640	36264	9.0	I wonder if Uncle Walt knew what he was starting ?	When Disney did the first The Three Little Pigs , I wonder if he knew he was starting a cottage industry at the very least and The Animators Lifetime Employment Act at most . I suspect more different animators have taken a turn at the Pigs than any other characters in the history of animation . There have been military takes ( Blitz Wolf ) , Pigs as con artists ( a meeting with Bugs Bunny ) and musical takes , like this one . This is one of the better uses of classical music tied to animation ( the best short to do so is Rhapsody in Rivets ) , with the action on screen fitted to the corresponding musical scoring . This was nominated for an Oscar and periodically plays on Cartoon Network . Recommended .
579479	583640	46922	9.0	Sylvester , Tweety up a tree , surrounded by a do pound full of bulldogs-it isn't pretty for Sylvester !	This is a series of set pieces called blackouts , all revolving on Sylvester's increasingly outlandish , generally painfully futile , attempts to get to a supremely well-guarded Tweety . I doubt Fort Knox is much safer than Tweety is from Sylvester in this one . Animals in cartoons are certainly an inventive and quite resourceful lot ! Mostly sight gags with a couple of funny lines . The closing gag snatches defeat from the jaws of victory with a cameo from a prominent member of the principal stable of characters who is definitely more than Sylvester can handle . The final line from Tweety is a groaner , but this is a wonderful short . Well worth watching . Most recommended
579981	583640	79079	9.0	This short starts out in a humorous vein , turns bittersweet and then has a tender , touching ending	I recently saw this film on the DVD released by Rembrandt Films , The Best of Zagreb Film-Nudity Required . I want to talk about the short in some detail , so there will be a spoiler or two-consider yourself warned : I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this , so I went in expecting nothing at all , to be honest . After the first minute or two , I figured it would be a comical farce detailing one slightly brow-beaten little man's misadventures with a blow-up doll . Much of the short , we watch the poor man's life disintegrate because of his interactions with a doll which seems to have a mind of its own . The guy pretty much loses everything , at one point , except the doll and we see him establishing a " relationship " of sorts with the doll . That's when tragedy strikes and the final indignity is administered to the man by three punks . The fight between the man and the three punks is beautifully done , by the way . The doll is damaged beyond repair and the man is desolate . Enter the final twist and some of the funniest bits in the short , as well as the most touching and charming part of the short , at the very end . Watching the end , it's easy to see why this was nominated for an Academy Award for Animated Short . As others have commented , it resonates with the live-action short The Red Balloon . A delightful ending , to say the least . While this isn't Bob Godfrey's best short ( that honor goes to Great ) it's certainly well worth watching and is recommended .
579859	583640	150961	9.0	Smile when you say that , pardner !	In the unlikely event that someone out there doesn't realize this already , this is a very strange parody of High Noon . One of the better Woody Woodpeckers . the nemesis here is Buzz Buzzard , who gave me nightmares as a child . That may be why I rarely like cartoons involving Buzz . This is , happily , an exception . Well worth the time and trouble to track down . Most recommended .
579418	583640	53921	9.0	Wile E . Coyote-a study in singlemindedness .	Wile E Coyote is a study in blind perserverance . He pursues one quarry with total fixation and even a failure rate of stunning perfection deters him not a whit . If the concepts of reincarnation and karma are at all valid , then you have to wonder just what horrible sin lies in a past life to cause Wile E . Coyote such agony and misfortune . The only thing I can figure is that he was the first politician in a previous life , possibly a lawyer , ( or both ) as that is the only thing that would remotely consign him to such a karmic fate . Excellent cartoon . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
578860	583640	61663	9.0	One of the better Speedy / Daffy pairings	One of the biggest problems with the Speedy versus Daffy cartoons is that they aren't really natural adversaries , so it's hard to sell Daffy as really a believable nemesis , unlike Sylvester ( a natural pairing , obviously ) , so the cartoons aren't terribly logical , even for cartoons . Add to that the fact that Daffy seems exceptionally mean and nasty , even for him , in one or two . This one , however , is logical and effectively executed . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579164	583640	151970	10.0	Great mix of Jazz and animation in a re-telling of the Pied Piper fairy tale .	Walter Lantz used jazz music to score quite a few cartoons because the head of his music department liked jazz and knew some musicians personally . Jack Teagarden was one of the musicians who appeared on the soundtracks to at least two of the better musical shorts , the magnificent Sliphorn King of Polaroo and this one , that's almost as good . Here the Pied Piper plays swing on a trombone to rid the town of rats and the mayor sounds like Lou Costello . Wonderful cartoon that should be available . Well worth tracking down and getting . Most highly recommended .
579075	583640	85548	10.0	Yet another triumph from the National Film Board of Canada	This documentary , which won an Oscar for Documentary Short , shows a dance class in session with the students being shown how to dance flamenco . Interspersed between shots of the students practising steps and dancing , the instructors are interviewed . It's a fascinating view of a beautiful style of dance as well as proof that some people are most fortunate to be able to do something they love for a living . The National Film Board of Canada was involved in overseeing this production and has consistently produced excellent work for more than sixty years .
579733	583640	118540	10.0	A thouroughly moving , tour de force and the best thing Spike Lee has done to date	This is an incredible documentary ! How it failed to win the Oscar puzzles me , although I must confess that I haven't seen the winner . Be that as it may , Spike Lee put together a moving ad compelling tribute to four innocents . The incident covered here , ironically , probably gave much needed impetus to the civil-rights movement , particularly with people in the North , a bittersweet point not lost on many of the interviewees . See this documentary ! Most highly recommended !
579054	583640	30357	10.0	Atypical Popeye , with no fisticuffs ad showing the essential natures of the three principal characters .	This Popeye , set on New Year's Eve , doesn't feature a brawl over Olive , or over anything else , for that matter . Popeye . a good-natured sort , decides it's not right that Olive's grandma be left at home while they go out , so he invites her along . Bluto escorts Olive and they both find it amusing that Popeye asked out grandma . Popeye is the soul of courtesy to grandma . A perfect example of the type of small kindnesses the world can never have enough of , then or now . Wimpy puts in a cameo ( with a different voice ) and the ending is quite funny . Listen for some of Jack Mercer's asides . This is a wonderful cartoon altogether different in mood and tone from the standard Popeye shorts , appropriately so , for the New Year's Eve setting . I wish all who read this a happy and healthy year . This short is well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
578946	583640	32953	10.0	The first Tom and Jerry cartoon	This short , nominated for an Oscar it should have won in 1940 , is the first Tom and Jerry , for all that the cat's name is " Jasper " . The Tom and Jerry cartoons generally break down into one of four eras : the early ones , when Rudolf Ising was involved , then the ones that Hanna and Barbera did with Fred Quimby producing , then the ones Chuck Jones did and finally the Gene Deitch efforts . Each had a different look and feel to them that make them instantly recognizable and unmistakable as to who did them . But the most remarkable transformation in appearance and style was the change between the early ones and the ones in the later 1940s . In every way , it's quite a change . This is the best of the early ones . Most recommended .
579606	583640	39189	10.0	The best Daffy Duck solo cartoon ever made	This is the best cartoon they made were Daffy wasn't playing opposite Bugs or Porky Pig . His foils are a dog named Leopold and his master , a parody of Peter Lorre . The best lines in the whole cartoon are spoken by the " mad scientist " and they're some of the funniest I can recall . The cartoon really gets going during the requisite chase scenes . After all , what's a cartoon without a chase sequence ? One of my all-time favorites . Most definitely recommended .
578789	583640	43581	10.0	Minimal animation , even for UPA , but delightful characters and script	This short , which won an Oscar , spawned two sequels and a TV cartoon show , has minimal animation but adelightful script ( by Theodore Geisel aka Dr . Seuss ) and aneven more memorable and enchanting main character . UPA pioneered a style of animation that even influenced Disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s . This is on of their finest . God to have it in print . Highly recommended .
579234	583640	206319	10.0	Excellent combination of animation and music .	This short is beautifully executed , but hard to describe . I cannot really figure out what , if any , relation the title has to the animation . I can say that it's an extremely good blending of movement to music , although the visuals can sometimes have a jarring effect on the viewer , mostly in the color combinations . A BAFTA nominee , well deserving of the honor , it was included in Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation , Vol . Four and is well worth tracking down . Most recommended .
579229	583640	35774	10.0	Daffy joins the military as a commando	This is a marvelous little bit of propaganda using Daffy to help lampoon the enemy , in this case the Nazis . I think my favorite bit is Daffy singing as he parachutes down , although the ending is a close second . Something I find myself wondering when I see this cartoon ( which probably means I have way too much time on my hands ) is whether the writers on the film Stalag 17 decided to name the guard in their film Schultz after this cartoon's Schultz and if , in turn , Schultz in Hogan's Heros was named after the guard in the film . My , such grand philosophical questions I ponder ! Great short and most definitely worth seeking out . Most highly recommended .
579382	583640	24404	10.0	Music was a big part of cartoons in general and Betty Boop in particular .	Animation and music have gone hand in glove since the sound era and probably beforehand . While Warner Brothers and MGM featured music prominently , Lantz and Fliescher went a step or two further , by creating series built around music ( mostly jazz ) and the Betty Boop shorts featured music frequently . This short is one of the best they did . The mix of the animation and the Cab Calloway song is fantastic ! All the studios used music in the creative process for their animation , with varying success . Warner Brothers did so because they saw a way to utilize the large catalog of songs from their film library , while Disney saw the potential revenue streams music would afford them . Whatever the reason , some great cartoons were made , including quite few Betty Boops . This is a must see . Most highly recommended .
579457	583640	47285	10.0	The second of two run-ins with the same construction worker and good prevails again .	This is the second time this rather arrogant and somewhat dense construction worker tries to best Bugs Bunny . Will they never learn that it's a fools ' errand to try ? Still , if they never tried , there wouldn't be these hilarious shorts to enjoy , if you can see them before the editors get to them in the mistaken belief that children aren't smart enough to distinguish cartoon from reality . Excellent in all respects and well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
579719	583640	96238	10.0	Tex Avery would have been pleased with this one .	This short was nominated for the Academy Award . All too frequently , one hears that something was done " in the tradition of . . . " or " In the style of . . . " and it usually is not a flattering comparison . This short is an exception . I had seen comments comparing this favorably to the work of Tex Avery and was not sure what to expect . Lo and behold , it is in , fact , a short that is chiefly sight gag after sight gag , fired rapidly at the audience without pause . Plotting is basic and second to the gags and the ending is vintage Avery . The first time I watched this , I was too busy laughing to make comparisons , but this is a short that could easily fit into the Avery shorts with nary a raised eyebrow and hold it's own with the best that remarkable talent produced . It's a fantastic piece and a good thing that it's in print . It can also be found on The World's Greatest Animation and is more than worth the effort to get . A great cartoon ! Most highly recommended !
579580	583640	32071	10.0	Disney adaptation of Andersen fairy tale that remains true to the original and quite warm and touching .	Disney's track record for adaptations of works of literature is decidedly mixed . This version of Hans Christian Andersen's , " The Ugly Duckling " is one of the most successful ones and quite deservedly won another Oscar for Uncle Walt . It's a beautiful short on all counts-animation , backgrounds , artwork , scoring , eveything-Disney at it's best . When Disney was at their best , no one could touch them . This short does justice to one of the most well-known fairy tales of all time and almost makes up for what they did to Felix Salten's " Bambi " . Almost . This one should be in-print and runs on The Ink and Paint Club . An absolute masterpiece and anyone who loves animation has got to see this one ! Recommended .
579540	583640	35794	10.0	This is a remarkable piece of work !	This short won an Academy Award and should have ! An exceptionally tough cartoon to see , as it's most difficult to find . Disney , with some understandable reluctance , has not made this available . While understandable , I don't agree with the choice they've made here . This cartoon should be seen , it should be widely available and is a big part of the Golden Age of Disney . Qute probably the best theatrical short Disney ever made ( certainly the best that I've seen ) and it's unfortunate that DIsney has clearly consigned it to the vaults . I fervently hope they change their minds . My highest recommendation here . Worth the trouble to locate and should be in print ! ! !
579589	583640	33698	10.0	The cartoon that ended Avery's career at Warner Brothers	This short led directly to the exit of Tex Avery from Warner Brothers . Some sources say he was fired , others that he quit , but Leon Schlesinger's mistake was Avery's , animation's and MGM's gain . Avery did some fantastic work at MGM , animation gained from his influence on another studio and MGM gained by having the competition between Avery and Hanna and Barbera , which improved both teams . Avery's influence can be seen on the Tom and Jerry series in the mid to late 1940s and it's open to question whether Droopy or Screwball Squirrel would have developed at a crowded Warner Brothers . Who knows what would have developed ( or not developed ) at Warner Brothers had Avery NOT gone to MGM . Excellent short . Most highly recommended .
579073	583640	27785	10.0	An exceptionally cute and very well done cartoon from the master	This is an early cartoon done by Tex Avery when he was still being screen-credited as Fred . I haven't seen it in years but recall it vividly . Little son scarecrow wants to follow in dad's footsteps ( or should that be strawsteps ? ) but dad suggests he wait a bit until he's older . Son decides to give it a go anyway , with predictable results . The expressiveness of the various characters is quite remarkable and I've seen film footage of Avery and another resident ( or maybe inmate is more accurate ) acting out one scene , which is probably why the movements seem so realistic . It's an entertaining and effective piece of animation . A good time was had by all . Most recommended
579988	583640	933357	10.0	Engaging , sweet and thoroughly charming short .	I've seen three of the five shorts nominated for the Oscar and this short is the best of the three I've seen . I'm not at all surprised that it was the winner . Since it would be difficult to discuss this short without going into at least a few details , let this serve as a spoiler warning : The basic idea behind this short regards the importance of random chance in all our lives . Narrated ( very effectively ) by Liv Ullman , with no other vocal work save hers , the story unfolds gradually and softly , with little touches of humor here and there . There are quite a few playful nudges at Danes and Norwegians throughout . The story centers on a Danish poet and his hit-and-miss relationship with a Norwegian farmer's daughter . The relationship has a good many twists and turns , with a logic chain made up of all sorts of random events which change the course of various lives . Barking dogs , inattentive mail carriers , slippery boards , a funeral and hairstyles all take their turn at changing things , all leading to the marvelous conclusion . This short is available ( on DVD ) from the National Film Board of Canada and is well worth watching . Highly recommended .
579874	583640	29953	10.0	Popeye the animal lover in a bullfight ?	Let me state at the outset that when it comes to bullfighting , my sympathies are entirely with the bull and anyone foolish enough to to get in the ring with one for " sport " deserves whatever happens to him . End of sermon . Here we have a very reluctant Popeye essentially drafted by default into the position of matador by being in the wrong place at the wrong time by virtue of his flirtation with Olive . This is a bullfight , Popeye style . A great cartoon , with snappy dialogue , typically fine animation and the inimitable Jack Mercer and a fine time is had by all . One of the more inventive ways for Popeye to get ahold of his spinach fix , so as to emerge once again covered in victory , is seen here . One of my favorite Popeye shorts . Originally done in black and white , there is also a colorized version . While the color version is okay , the black and white is better . Well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
579795	583640	25705	10.0	Great pre-Code Betty Boop short	This cartoon is a perfect example of the creativity and inventiveness that was possible prior to the advent of the Hays Office and The Code that tamed Betty Boop and made many of the subsequent shorts so much more dull and lifeless . The irony is that Will Hays was a politician who was involved in the Harding administration , which found no rival for corruption until the Nixon administration . Mr . Hays was the last person to lecture anyone on behavior ! The details of this cartoon would never have found acceptance under Hays or The Code , so I'm glad it was made and released before all the nonsense went into effect . Wonderful short . In print and available . Well worth watching . Most highly recommended .
579439	583640	27977	10.0	Chaplin's masterpiece	This is absolutely the finest film Charlie Chaplin ever made-which , considering the overall quality of his work , says a great deal for the quality of the film . Genius is a much over-used word , but in Chaplin's case , it's use is apt . This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made ! The scenes in the factory are hilarious . You have got to see this film ! Most joyously , totally and highly RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !
578861	583640	26111	10.0	My favorite Popeye of all time !	I love this cartoon ! ! The song , Barnacle Bill the Sailor " is a favorite of mine and this is one of the few cartoons in the series where Olive Oyl gets her comeuppance . Although occasionally , Olive and Popeye treat each other as though they are truly in love , Olive all too often treats Popeye rather shabbily , in my view , and I've frequently wondered why he doesn't just quit seeing her . She can't seem to make up her mind between Bluto and Popeye , anyway . While I believe that a gentleman treats a lady like a lady even if she periodically doesn't behave like one ( a man who does not act like a gentleman unless expressly requested to behave otherwise should be ignored ) , I also believe that constantly having the same woman throw one over in favor of the same clown indicates a permanent change of interests is of mutual benefit to all parties . It's a delightful short and the ending is a hoot ! The army won't even know what hit them !
578902	583640	29795	10.0	When Disney was in flower !	This short is an example of The Mouse at their best ! There was a time when Disney was , without a doubt , the best there was . 1937 was a good year for Uncle Walt and his studio . With Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and shorts like this one , it was a banner year . This is a quintessential example of Silly Symphonies-a near seamless blend of music to animation . Good to see it in-print . Well worth getting . Most highly recommended .
579426	583640	20414	10.0	Ub Iwerks did an incredible job here !	This is the first of the Silly Symphonies series of cartoons that Dsney did and it is absolutely marvelous ! Ub Iwerks directed and it is one of the best Disney shorts they ever made . After more than 70 years it still holds up well and has the most remarkable use of shadows I've ever seen in my life . Great cartoon and very highly recommended .
579133	583640	34097	10.0	Bravo ! Bravo ! ! Encore ! Encore ! !	This cartoon short SHOULD have won the Oscar instead of Lend A Paw ! An absolutely perfect blending of music and action throughout , well-executed at every turn . Incredibly funny with no dialogue-sight gags only and the running gags are great ! Wonderful marriage of beautiful music and antic lunacy with a drop dead ending ! Fanatically , totally recommended ! I love this cartoon ! ! !
579801	583640	36279	10.0	The unmistakable rhythms of Dr . Seuss are part of the charms of this exceptional short !	For several of the shorts in this series , Theodore Geisel ( aka Dr . Seuss ) scripted and the speech patterns here reflect his quite familiar cadence . It's great ! Private Snafu really screws up royally here , which was the point , as the series was meant to show soldiers what not to do and what the consequences could be . These are not balanced and fair cartoons-there was a war on at the time and Germany and Japan were the ENEMY , so the caricatures are not nice . If you are easily offended , you likely won't like these . The series is great and well worth watching . Recommended .
579367	583640	220676	10.0	For Richard Condie , this is a " normal " short .	If most directors did a cartoon like this , it would probably be the oddest thing they ever did . But for Richard Condie , this is a comparatively normal short ( " comparatively " being the operative word-Condie does nothing " normal " ) whereas everything else I've ever seen is stranger than this within sixty seconds . Condie is an acquired taste and I've acquired it myself , which probably means a great deal , but I'm getting better , honest . Condie is a national treasure ( or should be ) in Canada , the Mad Genius . A wonderful short , well worth tracking down . Most recommended .
579336	583640	46973	10.0	Not one of Claude's better days , I'd imagine .	This is my favorite of the shorts starring Marc Anthony , though one of the others , Cat Feud , is a better cartoon . Claude Cat is thoroughly unlikeable in this one . He's deceitful , disgraceful and devious and those are his good qualities ! Marc Anthony ( clearly a dog's equivalent to Prince Valiant ) wins out for the cause and for Truth , Justice and the American Way ( oops , wrong hero ) and the dim bulb that is the human " master " finally realizes that Claude's been playing him like a pipe organ in church . Marc Anthony's final ruse to get inside is priceless , as are Claude's facial expressions as the plot unfolds . The ending is marvelous and Claude's exit line is perfect . Well worth tracking down and watching . Most recommended .
579003	583640	47001	10.0	Makes Walter Mitty look like an under-achiever !	Nominated for an Oscar , this cartoon is a takeoff on Walter Mity , with a small boy named Ralph Phillips surpassing Mitty in inventiveness . Thoroughly engaging and extremely hilarious , the situations Ralph imagines are wonderful and so off-beat ( particularly his bout with mathematics ! ) that the cartoon can be watched again and again without getting old or growing flat . Most highly recommended .
579370	583640	203310	10.0	This is an incredibly strange and unusual cartoon , even for a Richard Condie !	Richard Condie , under the umbrella of the National Film Board of Canada , does some fairly odd and wonderful work . This one is pretty strange even for Condie ! I am seldom at a loss for words , but trying to describe this one and do it justice is difficult . This airs somewhat frequently on O Canada on the Cartoon Network . The show itself is well worth watching . Catch this one if you can . Highly recommended !
579290	583640	47097	10.0	Heavier than usual on funny dialogue , but still lots of sight gags . ( Possible spoilers )	I had to do a comment on this cartoon , ma'am-it's the law of the West ! Besides , today I celebrate the seventh anniversary of my moving into my current little cubbyhole I call home and it's appropriate for the day . Tex Avery had several different wolf characters-the urbane yet lecherous wolf ( or just plain lecherous wolf ) of the Red cartoons , the Southern wolf in several Droopys and other one-shots and the Western wolf seen here in the Western-oriented shorts like Deputy Droopy . Always a nemesis for Droopy , usually an outlaw ( here , he's a cattleman who doesn't like homesteaders ) , he has more range than Spike and is a more enjoyable villain . The dialogue is funnier than is typically the case in a Tex Avery cartoon ( Avery loved the visual gag dearly ) and a lot of the laughs come from funny lines delivered by the Wolf . Well worth tracking down . Most highly recommended .
579615	583640	48292	10.0	A masterpiece and in my opinion the best short Tex Avery ever made !	Tex Avery was the best director of cartoon shorts , certainly in the Golden Age and probably ever . In my opinion , The Legend of Rockabye Point is his best short in a long , distinguished career . t's nominally a Chilly Willy cartoon , but the primary focus is not Chilly , but a polar bear named Charlie and a bulldog ( I think his name is Sam ) and the perfect Avery running gag . That this is not currently in-print saddens me beyond belief . It should be . I wish I had this cartoon ! Highly recomended .
579971	583640	29151	10.0	Beautifully crafted short all the more remarkable for the studio that did such exceptional work here .	Charles Mintz saw gold in them there cartoons and thus jettisoned Walt Disney and the contractual relationship they had to start in-house production and make ( he thought ) even more for himself . But Mintz had a gourmand's palate without the imagination or financial willingness to feed such tastes . Columbia was rarely to come even within shouting distance of Disney , MGM and Warner Brothers where animated shorts were concerned . They just didn't much take the time or effort to go beyond nice , enjoyable fluff to fulfill contractual obligations . That makes The Little Match Girl all the more incredible , because it's an emerald awash in a sea of shiny marbles . Much of the credit can go to Al Davis and Sid Marcus , both exceptionally talented . This is probably the crown jewel in Davis's career , a compliment , to say the least . They manage to make this endearing and heart-wrenching without it becoming maudlin or cloying . It's a remarkable piece of work and , had it been more properly promoted at the time , might have won the Academy Award ( and probably should have ) . I don't usually go into detail about the contents of a film , preferring to let the film speak for itself , but one point I need to make : the decision to make the child smaller than normal in perspective to the world around he was brilliant-to a child , the " grownup " world is huge and more than a bit scary . It works wonderfully . That this isn't in print and available is a shame , as it should be . Well worth hunting up . Most highly recommended .
