579466	583640	26726	4.0	If I judged this solely on the look of the cartoon , I'd give it decent marks-but one cannot live on animation and backgrounds alone .	This is a beautiful bore of a cartoon . The story would have bored me to tears when I was five . Visually , it's very nice , with striking backgrounds and nice color . It's this type of cartoon that led an animator who worked for Van Beuren to do a comic strip modeled after the head of the studio and call it " Van Boring " . There will be minimal spoilers , but there will be spoilers of the action ( the " plot " , such as it is , was spoiled before I was born ) : Molly is friends with the butterflies and she watches a show put on by the butterflies . The nicest bit in the picture is a very cute lighting " effect " during the show . It's beautifully drawn and animated . Had the short been along these lines all the way through , the cartoon would be much better . It didn't last very long . There is introduced a " villain " - a butterfly collector , who basically scoops up butterflies and sings a song which makes the songs Raffi sings sound like arias . It's clearly targeted at children , but Fred Rogers proved that children deserved better than this drivel and that they could appreciated it as well . Molly . of course , saves the day and proves that the butterfly collector is as bright as a two watt bulb in the process . Thankfully , the closing scene is , in many ways , beautiful in terms of both animation and color . It took the bad taste out of my mouth . If you like good animation and the visually artistic side of cartoons , this is worth watching .
578788	583640	59322	5.0	Why was this cartoon made ?	While I've seen worse , I kept thinking that this cartoon would have no reason to exist save for the fact that Warner Brothers had a contractual obligation to supply a certain number of shorts to movie theaters , so they fiddled around with film stock , yawned and sent this one out on an unsuspecting and somewhat indifferent world . While my view of the later Warner output is more charitable than others feel is warranted , a few miss the mark for me . This is one . Worth watching once . Recommended for completists .
579625	583640	95506	5.0	One joke that is beaten into the ground by the time this ends .	When this begins , it's amusing , particularly if you know the ad campaign this lampoons . But the problem is , the premise isn't strong enough to support the length of the cartoon . It's a joke with one punchline repeated far too often and after a while , it becomes tedious , at least it did to me . The first one and a-half minutes are quite funny and then it becomes repetitive and the idea just isn't clever enough in and of itself to sustain itself over the rest . Still , worth watching once .
579461	583640	150232	5.0	A pretty much standard formula Mighty Mouse notable primarily for the dog guarding the sheep	This short is a fairly predictable short , with the only really notable aspect being the appearance of one of the two dogs who act as foils for Heckle and Jeckle as the shepherd ! Though there really isn't much to spoil , I will be discussing some detail , so here's a spoiler warning : This is pretty much " The Boy Who Cried Wolf " , only this is the " Sheep Who Cried Wolf " in this case . Five young sheep tended by a dog are going out to graze and one , a troublemaker , throws a tomato at the dog . Not satisfied , he repeatedly warns of a wolf and-well you can guess the rest . A wolf comes along and catches the bad little sheep . His brothers plead for Mighty Mouse to come save him , which ( of course ) Mighty Mouse does . The wolf , not able to stand up with Mighty Mouse , calls on other wolves for help ( notice that he didn't call them when there was a flock ripe for the picking , though ) and eventually all are bested by a caped mouse small enough to fit in one of their paws . What will the boys at the union hall say at Wolf Local # 342 ? Enjoyable for kids , but nothing terribly inventive here . Worth watching once .
578962	583640	148455	5.0	Well drawn and animated but trite and uninteresting .	There's a funny thing about this cartoon-not that it's funny ( it really isn't ) but the characters all tend to look familiar . The teacher is the character Iwerks used as everything from a landlady to Flip's wife ( ! ) in Flip the Frog , the kids all resemble each other like a B-grade horror flick ( Village of the Damned Stepford Children perhaps ? ) and apart from good technical aspects , it would bore a five year old inside thirty seconds . Like some actresses I won't name-all looks and no substance . Worth a look or two , but don't expect much . Iwerks was just playing out the string here . For completists only .
579968	583640	22710	5.0	Except for a running gag featuring an eagle in the last part of the short , this one is pretty unmemorable .	There's not much to this short apart from one running gag and a few sight gags . You get a general feeling about the whole , but very little stands out and makes a lasting impression . I will discuss one or two things here , so this is a spoiler warning : The cartoon has some cute gags in the first couple of minutes , with the marching band and what looks like a moose doubling as a turnstile . Intercut in here are scenes of Bosko being tortured under the guise of being given a " massage " ( ouch ! ) . The football game is really not very interesting in and of itself . There are one or two good gags and some horrible puns that pop up . Most of the funny stuff is off the field antics ( a reporter pounding away at his typewriter until the typewriter pounds back , a face appearing in the crowd watching the game in obvious disapproval , etc . ) . Toward the end , they periodically cut away to an eagle perched upon a flagpole . This running bit is far more interesting than the rest of the short and the ending is quite good . I won't spoil it here . Though this cartoon is not all that special , I hope it is released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection at some point . Worth watching once .
579499	583640	63433	6.0	I found the camel most annoying !	This is a marginal short partially salvaged by an interesting ending . There will be mild spoilers in the portion which follows : The Pink Pather is looking for artifacts and / or jewels in Egypt . He goes to buy a camel , but has little money and has to settle for a small camel that behaves as if it were a dog . The old saying truly holds here-he got what he paid for , which wasn't much . In spots , it reminds me all too much of the horse in Pinto Pink and other shorts The little camel causes the Pink Panther no end of trouble and gets chased away more than once here . There are a couple of interesting gags involving water in one way or another , with the strange sight of a camel guzzling a canteen being the most unusual . The Pink Panther has a few experiences with explosives here and finally manages to get into a crypt-one with a warning of a curse on anyone who enters . He grabs a large gem and begins running , only to periodically change into things-a rat , a lizard , etc . Not the greatest short , but it's only six minutes long and it does have a few moments which make it worth watching . It's on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , which is well worth getting .
578770	583640	32603	7.0	Has its moments , but this is my least favorite Tex Avery cartoon .	This cartoon is really atypical of Tex Avery in that entirely too many of the gags are either verbal or sight gags that require verbal assistance to make any sense of at all-a surefire killer for a sight gag . The pacing-largely unavoidable here-is too slow and a few gags just aren't that funny . At least one dies completely . There are moments here , but Avery did this type of short more successfully with other cartoons ( such as A Gander At Mother Goose ) and , while I still don't think he did any really bad cartoons , this is as close as he came to doing one . Recommended for die-hard Avery fans , who'll watch anything he did ( like me ) .
579885	583640	30503	7.0	Notable chiefly for being Chuck Jones's directorial debut-cute , but not compelling	This is a very cute cartoon , but not an especially interesting short on its own merits . The chief point of interest here is as the very first cartoon which Chuck Jones directed . As I will mention some details , there will be mild spoilers : The basic premise of this short is that the regular night watchman , a full-grown cat , is sick and can't make his rounds and so the task falls to his young son . To say that the mice are less than concerned about the new night watchman would be an understatement . They're bigger , meaner and tougher than the little cat and bully him mercilessly . This turn of events means that they have pretty much got free run of the kitchen for most of the short . There are a few cute food-related sight gags , but the short is a bit flatter and less energetic than you would expect , though , to be fair , if you look at it without comparing it to later work by Jones , it comes off looking a good deal better . The ending is all rather predictable , though fun to watch for the most part . This isn't a bad short , it just pales in comparison to the work which would come later , though it does make clear that Jones was interested in the cute and sentimental from the beginning . This was probably the genesis of the Sniffles shorts done a bit later . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is worth a look . The Collection , as with the previous three volumes , is most highly recommended .
579163	583640	151893	7.0	Early Woody Woodpecker	This short , also available on a great many public domain tapes under the alternate title of Pantry Panic , is proof that the difference between predator and prey is a matter of who is the hungriest . Entertaining but unexceptional . Fairly easy to find . Worth watching . Recommended if you like Woody .
579305	583640	30289	7.0	Egghead as a romantic lead . I must have missed something .	This is an excellent cartoon , with the incongruous premise that Egghead is a romantic leading man . I can see it now-first , there was Valentino and John Gilbert , then Gable and now Egghead . Oh , well , he's a Tex Avery leading man ! This is a typical Avery short-sight gags come so fast and furious that they almost inundate the audience and you usually need three or four viewings to catch everything . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
579569	583640	147998	7.0	The bits are greater than the whole .	This is a very funny cartoon , but from a plotting standpoint , it's a mess . The individual gags just happen more or less by happenstance . Ub Iwerks was interested in technique more than content . He was an idea man only when it came to the mechanics of things . A master at what he did and one of the finest animators who ever dipped a pen into an inkwell , but not overly interested in mundane trifles like plots or stories . Tex Avery , master of the machine gun school of sight gags , included something resembling a plot most of the time , even if he simply poked fun at it later . This was Iwerk's Achilles heel and why , at least in part , his studio folded in a few years . His shorts were visually nice , even beautiful in some cases , funny and often just as forgettable as a stale piece of toast . This has some wonderful gags and you may remember the gag for years-but forget which cartoon it was in after two days . The individual parts are better than their sum . Worth watching because the animation is superb . Cotton candy , sumptuous but hardly filling . Recommended with above caveats .
579360	583640	58597	7.0	A trifle cute in spots , particularly the end , but has its moments nonetheless .	The Chuck Jones Tom and Jerry cartoons were quite uneven . He and his crew could never quite seem to make up their minds as to whether the pair were adversaries or pals . Here , they start out enemies and become best buddies . But there are some good visual bits and a stunning lack of planning and foresight on Tom's part-following his plans down to their logical conclusion doesn't seem to be his long suit . Enjoyable , even if the ending is a bit too precious for words . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579448	583640	92105	7.0	Not their best teaming , but Lancaster and Douglas work well together	This is a rather light comedy , not an exceptional film , but entertaining enough . While Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster turn in engaging performances , the movie is stolen by Eli Wallach , whose character is nothing if not persistent ! There are some very funny bits here . If you're looking for something light , funny and enjoyable , this one works . Worth watching .
578856	583640	150603	7.0	A turtle wants to fly and gets his wish-sort of .	This is a cute little uncomplicated cartoon about a turtle who wants to fly more than anything . Because I want to talk about a few details , this is a spoiler warning : Herman the Turtle dreams of flying , reads books on the subject and is teased about it by birds , including a bald eagle . He even tries taking flying lessons and building himself some wings . He ultimately winds up underwater , where he finds a treasure chest . He bribes the eagle to take him up in the air so that he can fly . There are some really good visual gags in the sequence where the eagle takes him up , with the turtle always saying " Higher ! " whenever the eagle asks him if the altitude is good enough . Finally , the eagle says , " End of the line " and drops Herman off . Herman grabs two of the eagle's tail feathers and starts flapping his arms furiously . Unfortunately for him , it doesn't work very well for him at all and he drops rapidly to meet the ground . The narrator announces Herman's demise in somber tones as the scene shifts upward to " Turtle Heaven " and we see Herman flying with angel's wings and happy as a clam . This is available on one of the Columbia House DVDs and is well worth watching . Recommended .
579472	583640	31610	7.0	Why are the most interesting characters in Der Captain and the Kids cartoons generally animals ?	This is an average cartoon in a decidedly mixed series based on a comic strip . The primary focus and source of most of the laughs and all the best gags is a horse less than pleased to have his most prized fashion accessory " creatively acquired " by Hans and Fritz . The rest of the cartoon basically lays there in a stupor , waiting for the horse to do something to make things funny . Some concepts just simply don't translate well to active media . Worth seeing at least once , but average at best . Lukewarm recommendation .
579399	583640	150728	7.0	With friends like these , who needs enemies ?	This is one of the shorts in David Hand's Animaland series , which centered around a squirrel named Ginger Nutt and his animal friends ( including his girlfriend , another squirrel named Hazel . There will be spoilers below : Ginger Nutt is doing what most males do from time to time-swearing to the love of his life that he'd protect her from anything with his very life . Several of the other animals , being his " friends " hear this and do what " friends " do in such a situation-hatch a plan to scare the daylights out of Ginger and make him look bad in front of Hazel . They take a piece of wood in the shape of a skull and scare Ginger so badly with it that he runs back to his tree . At his home , he begins to fret about his behavior , imaging Hazel's changing moods towards him because he ran , with his imaginings very effectively displayed in an excellent set of sight gags . He resolves to find the monster and run it out of the forest , thus winning back the affections of Hazel , which he's certain he's lost . He goes back out looking for the " monster " and believes he's found it again , but discovers through mere chance just what is up and who's behind everything . Two of the three culprits , upon being found out , immediately run , leaving the ringleader , a crow , to face the music alone . The ending shows Ginger once again attempting to impress Hazel , until his plans come crashing down . But Hazel is a good sport and it all ends well . The surviving Animaland shorts were released on a DVD and are well worth seeing . Recommended .
579410	583640	62010	7.0	Rarely do I feel sympathy for Daffy , but I do in this one !	Daffy is rarely what I would call a sympathetic character , but here , to a large degree , he is a most sympathetic character indeed . Just looking for peace and quiet and bothering no one , he is bombarded at all turns by possibly the most insipid tune ever heard in cartoons and certainly ever heard in a Warner Brothers short ! Ten minutes of that might have made Mother Teresa commit murder ! Good cartoon with okay animation and an awful score . You have been warned ! Recommended , with the caveat above .
579179	583640	150880	7.0	Given Willie's glancing acquaintance with the truth , this is his tallest tale .	This cartoon exists only in fragmentary form and is on one of the Cartoons That Time Forgot DVDs . The fragments are reasonably good , though I'm not , truth be told , a fan of the Willie Whopper series . Having seen this , I would very much like to see Hell's Bells , a short Ub Iwerks directed some years earlier when he was first at Disney . Visually impressive , as always . Glad to see it in print . Worth watching . Recommended .
578782	583640	60053	7.0	Basically a remake of Broomstick Bunny .	This cartoon is really nothing more than a reworking of Broomstick Bunny with Daffy replacing Bugs and Speedy Gonzales worked into things as well . There's a great visual gag lifted from Duck Amuck as well that fits perfectly and is the best thing about this one , which isn't terribly original , save for how they use Speedy , which is quite hilarious . Worth watching for Speedy fans and the best Chuck Jones cartoon Bob McKimson ever made . Recommended for Speedy fans .
578851	583640	30999	7.0	Interesting variation on the " books / magazines come to life " plot line-this one uses travel brochures	There were a good number of shorts which used the conceit of having characters in books or magazines ( sometimes on items in a grocery store ) come to life and interact with each other . This is a rather novel variant , in that it uses travel brochures . As I want to discuss some details , there will be spoilers below : The beginning is a series of quick sight gags , generally with some kind of appropriate musical connection which fit the gag , most of them at least mildly amusing , the standout being " When Yuba Plays the Rhumba On the Tuba " . The middle portion consists of a takeoff on the title , re-wording the song it was taken from as " Food's An Education In Itself " , where we see two characters filling their plates from various brochures where puns make a connection to food possible ( " Turkey " , for example ) while a trio sing to accompany the animation . The last part is strictly a crime / chase sub-plot , involving the Thief of Baghdad stealing from the Kimberly Diamond Mines , only to be chased from brochure to brochure and finally caught , dragged along until he winds up seated behind the " Lone Stranger " . As they ride off , the Thief points out that he isn't " alone " anymore . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth watching . Recommended .
578921	583640	52056	7.0	Decent cartoon , typical Disney , but nothing exceptional	This longish short was nominated for an Oscar . Decent enough and a fairly good adaptation of the tall tale , but fairly routine Disney and with nothing especially memorable or exceptional about it in any area . Worth watching , this runs infrequently as filler on the Disney Channel during " Vault Disney in the wee hours of the morning .
579900	583640	101270	8.0	Good animation coupled with a sometimes entertaining , occasionally tedious , story	This short was nominated for an Academy Award and is well worth watching , though it was probably about a minute too long or thereabouts . It's often amusing , but drags in spots . Interesting idea with excellent animation , but uneven and tedious at times . Recommended .
579697	583640	80351	8.0	A very good short that has the seeds for two great ones planted within its fertile soil ( SPOILERS )	All Nothing was Frédérîc Back's first Academy Award nominee and is a very good short which might be more highly regarded if Back had not gone on to make both The Man Who Planted Trees and The Mighty River , the early genesis of which can be seen in All Nothing , as well as Crac ! , one of two Academy Award winners for Back ( the other being Man Who Planted Trees ) . Thus , three great animated shorts make a highly intelligent and thought provoking short disappear somewhat into the background . In print and available on A Tribute To Frédéric Back I cannot talk at all about the short itself without getting into specifics and I want to discuss it for various reasons , so the comment from the next paragraph on will contain spoilers . This is all subjective and other viewers may not see it the same , but I was fascinated by the fact that the short shows a creator who , in effect , incorporates evolution into the design for the planet . There are many examples of this , such as birds changing into other species of birds and other animals changing form and appearance , but the most profound use is on the humans , who go through stages-first form to aquatic , then to hairy primates , then avian life and finally to man . Interestingly , in the latter stages , man is also seen as grumbling , complaining and obnoxious . Man then becomes the extreme predator , to the creator's dismay and later anger . Man the predator then kills the creator and proceeds to do whatever he likes to the planet and other life on it without thought or consideration . At the end , man is no more satisfied and is just as empty and unhappy as before , until a final reconciliation occurs , Most recommended .
579587	583640	30465	8.0	Another Disney entrant in the " celebrity caricature " style of cartoon	Back in the 1930s and 1940s , various animation departments ( chief among them being Warner Brothers ) made cartoons that used caricatures of well-known celebrities ( movies stars , principally ) as characters . This is the best of Disney's efforts and was nominated for an Oscar . The main problem with this cartoon is that , unless you not only remember your nursey rhymes , but are reasonaby up on movie stars and movies of the 1930s , you miss quite a bit of the humor . Still holds up reasonably well after more than 60 years . Recommended to any movie buffs and / or someone reading Mother Goose for whatever reason .
579303	583640	32769	8.0	Standard Olive Oyl Plot # 1-good cartoon , though	This is a standard cartoon featuring Olive Oyl , of the most frequent variety-Olive dumps Popeye , typically for Bluto in one of many guises . Popeye , instead of celebrating his freedom , sets to win her back in defiance of all logic and common sense . He and Bluto fight , with Bluto holding his own or even winning until it's spinach time , whereupon Bluto becomes a punching speed bag for Popeye and Olive comes back to him-until the next time ! Oh well , that's life . Good cartoon with nice animation . Worth watching . Recommended .
579899	583640	103251	8.0	Good romance and Spader and Sarandon do have a certain chemistry on-screen	I will be frank : if Susan Sarandon had not been in this movie , I would not have watched . I will happily watch almost anything she appears in . James Spader's acting ability is marginal at best , but here , he does a very effective and surprisingly understated job and he and Sarandon do make sparks ( although Sarandon could make sparks all alone in a full-force hurricane ! ) as a couple in this . Very good romantic drama , despite the occasional mis-step . Recommended .
579922	583640	54674	8.0	Good example of the Coyote-Roadrunner series	Nominated for an Academy Award , there is nothing especially novel or intriguing about this short . It's just a good example of the series as a whole . Wile E . spends the bulk of the cartoon trying to catch the Roadrunner and giving his insurance agent the ulcer to end all ulcers . It also serves as a warning not to buy anything from Acme unless you are desperate and / or a masochist . Cartoon Network runs this with some frequency . Recommended .
579285	583640	32967	8.0	The best of a very short and not terribly effective series .	This was the best of a very short series of cartoons that was a misfired attempt playing on the Three Bears , with thoroughly unlikable characters , including Papa , a lazy , mean and obnoxious fellow , Mama , not much better than Papa and Baby , a cute cipher with no real personality to speak of and consequently most irritating . Production values are good and the story is good , with some funny moments , but MGM fared much better with the character of Barney Bear , with some endearing qualities mixed in with the gruffness . This series isn't anywhere near the same league as the considerably funnier Warner Brothers take on the same fairy tale and died quickly . This particular short has a good ending , but I've seen better ( and worse ) in my time . Average at best . Worth watching , but don't try too hard to find it unless you collect MGM cartoons . For completeists .
579259	583640	141299	8.0	Od , but interesting , sing-along short from Fleischer	This is an odd little entry from Fleischer in their Screen Song sing-along series . About half animation , half sing-along and a little hard to describe . Because I want to discuss some details , this is a spoiler warning : There really isn't all that much to this one . It starts out with mice taking buckets of water and splashing them on an elephant bathing behind a screen and just kind of goes on from there . Either mice are scrubbing other animals or the animals are washing themselves . There are two bits which I particularly like-one where a mouse is bathing cats using a tub and washboard , like a laundrywoman and a bit where a mouse , trying to get a sleeping dog to continue cranking a water-pump , pulls a pair of dice from his pocket and they morph into a bone ( a slang expression for dice is " bones " ) . After the cleaning finishes , a rather odd rabbit assembles the animals into an orchestra and then very exaggeratedly tells the audience that they will be playing the title tune and encourages the audience to sing along by following the " bouncing ball " . There follows the standard lyric display , though the last part features the rabbit in place of the ball and the words change as he steps on them . The animation is nice , though the song is rather melancholy and the singing is uninspired . Worth tracking down .
579281	583640	25807	8.0	Some great visuals and a few really funny sight gags make this worth watching .	This is a really funny early Popeye , with some really excellent visual effects . Swee ' Pea is making life most unhappy for all concerned-himself , Popeye and all the poor souls Popeye silences in order for the little noisemaker to stay asleep ( a consummation devoutly to be wished ) and thus to be silent . Costello is okay as Popeye here , though he never really did very well in my view . I'm not sure he understood the character terribly well . All in all , a fairly good cartoon largely consisting of sight gags of a fairly violent nature . Good early effort and worth seeing . Recommended .
579225	583640	22430	8.0	Interesting film that points up the need to sometimes face temporary personal risk in return for the greater good	This film , an early William Wellman , has an important message , particularly today . It posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal safty or well-being . The film , which has Walter Huston as the lead , is stolen by the performance of " Chic " Sales as Grampa . He's the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch . You'll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the ' 20's and ' 30's . Wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity . Recommended .
578833	583640	43450	8.0	Excellent example of a Tex Avery Droopy	This short is an excellent example of Tex Avery's handling of Droopy : Droopy is very quiet , passive and sedate ( almost sedated , actually ) as Spike tries to win a job competition through ways nefarious that never work out as intended . Droopy is just there to provide something to set up the sight gags . You still can't help but like him ( I can't , anyway ) because he's Everyman ( or should that be Everydog ? ) and he generally comes out on top . Good to see it's in print . Well worth seeing . Recommended .
579328	583640	39475	8.0	One of Tex Avery's George and Junior shorts and possibly the best of them .	Tex Avery only created a few continuing characters . This short features a team he developed , George and Junior , patterned after the lead characters in Of Mice and Men , which was a fairly frequent source for inspiration for not only Avery , but other cartoon directors as well . George and Junior aren't too funny in and of themselves , but rather they serve as foils and / or victims for situations and sight gags that are thrown at them . Characters weren't terribly important individually to Avery , what happened around and to them was . Thus , the closest he came to doing a popular character and using them over and over himself , was Droopy . Somewhat ironic , given his role at Warner Brothers in the early years in developing many of the mainstays of the animation department . This is a very good short and fortunately , it's in print . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579944	583640	60862	8.0	Excellent action-western with a great ensemble cast	This film has a terrific script , a great cast that works well together ( particularly the four lead , Lancaster , Marvin , Ryan and the wonderful and much-underrated Woody Strode ) , excellent production values and fine direction . I don't personally care for too many action movies and can take or leave westerns , but this is a most engaging film . Most recommended .
578922	583640	53120	8.0	One of the most unusual , atypical Disney cartoons I've ever seen	This cartoon was nominated for an Oscar in 1959 . The animation style is stop-motion , almost a Puppetoon type of animation . This is the only cartoon from Disney that I recall ever seeing . It certainly is not your typical Disney cartoon . The music is all over the board-there's even some pretty good blues in here . Worth chasing down to see at least once . Runs infrequently on the Disney Channel during " Vault Disney " in the wee hours of the morning .
579478	583640	31795	8.0	One of the more successful Captain and the Kids shorts	One of the few Captain cartoons done in color , this was a parody of the travelogue shorts popular at the time . The narration is a large part of the success of this short . Funny , pointed and often sarcastic and / or irreverent , the narration is the funniest aspect of this particular cartoon , part of a series MGM did based on the comic strip featuring Der Captain and the Kids . The Captain is his typical bumbling , ill-mannered self , of course . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579781	583640	150308	8.0	Quincy Magoo is at it again in this one	The title of this short is a play on the title of the feature film Destination Moon ( which itself has an animated sequence made by Walter Lantz and starring Woody Woodpecker ) and once again Magoo and his myopia take an adventure , hand in hand , off to the " Moon " . The life that man leads ! Excellent animation and great sight gags make this one worth finding . Most recommended .
579113	583640	57126	8.0	The last of the Bugs / Wile E . shorts	In this short , Bugs Bunny takes the place of the Road Runner because of an injury ( no doubt work-related , for which the Road Runner was probably on Worker's Compensation ) and Wile E . still has no more luck at chasing rabbits than he does Road Runners . More dialogue than the typical Road Runner short , but has lots of sight gags in any case . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579627	583640	95824	8.0	Very nice computer-generated animation	The story ( or stories , I should say ) are pretty much secondary here . This is very visually effective and quite impressive . A very nice piece of work . The piece isn't something I would recommend that you hunt up on its own , but is well worth watching , particularly if you can find Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation Vol 1 , which is an excellent compilation . This short is well worth watching .
579139	583640	51457	8.0	A very humorous cartoon visual in nature	This Cartoon consists of a great many sight-gags and is one of at least three cartoons that feature both Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot . While the concept of a bulldog becoming the protector of a kitten is too cute by half , this one has found a soft spot in my heart ( or is it my head ? ) because it principally covers what happens to another cat who tries to bully Pussyfoot and suffers , in consequence , Marc Anthony's wrath in return . I will always root for a bully to receive their comeuppance and the gags , while more or less standard , are reasonably good . Worth watching .
579759	583640	29595	8.0	Excellent use of caricatures in a " magazines come to life " short	A gimmick that Warner Brothers animators used quite often was the idea that characters / images come to life after business hours off of magazine covers , books or even grocery store labels and boxes . Quite often , they used caricatures of celebrities who would have been well-known to audiences in those days and they did so here , though not every character in this one is a caricature . I can't swear to it , but I suspect that all of the magazine titles featured in this one actually existed . I recognized most of them as having been magazines available on newsstands and elsewhere . The rest of my comments may contain spoilers , so you have been warned : The plot is pretty basic and predictable . What makes this cartoon interesting is the juxtaposition of titles to make up gags , like a crook coming out of " The Gang " and passing " Popular Mechanics " to grab a torch and having " Wall Street " close by , with a safe on the cover to crack . Charlie Chan captures him , he's tried by the " Judge " and sentenced to " Life " , but manages to sneak over to " Liberty " in order to make his escape . Things like that come together frequently . A lot of the standard caricatures are here ( including Ned Sparks-it must have been a requirement to have Ned Sparks appear somewhere in one of these , as he's in most of the ones I've seen ) and you'll be treated to the likes of Leopold Stowkowski , Greta Garbo , Clark Gable , Hugh Herbert and others . William Powell is here as Nick Charles from " The Thin Man " , along with his dog Asta . Everyone from the Boy Scouts to Santa Claus joins in on the chase when the villain escapes . How he is caught is hilarious and I won't spoil that gag . There's a cute ending involving Hugh Herbert as well . This short is on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 3 and is well worth getting . The Collections themselves are extremely well done and worth every penny . Recommended .
579143	583640	58036	8.0	Bugs Meets Taz , Take Four	This is the fourth and last Bugs versus Taz done in the 1960s and is almost as good as the first one was . Although most of the gags are visual ( including the closing one , a very good one indeed ) , there are verbal jokes as well and the dialogue is good . They made relatively few of these , I suspect because Taz's motivation was limited and therefore there wasn't anything they could do here that wasn't being done ( to better effect ) with the Wile E . Coyote and the Road-Runner series of cartoons . This one's very good and the ending is very funny ( unless you're Bugs Bunny ) . Recomended .
579057	583640	30592	9.0	Jack Mercer made Popeye funnier	The character of Popeye was entertaining enough early on in the Fleischer Studios days , when William Costello was doing vocal duties . But the real spark that made Popeye special was when Jack Mercer took over . Mercer started as part of the animation team and then became the voice of Popeye . The choice of Mercer was perfect , because Mercer basically created Popeye's personality , particularly with the mutterings and under the breath asides Popeye would make that were usually funnier than the principal dialogue . Plumbing Is a " Pipe " is an excellent example of this aspect of the Popeye shorts voiced by Mercer . Listen for Mercer's remarks throughout the final four or five minutes of this one . That , and the fact that Wimpy is a " plumber " , are hilarious and make this worth tracking down . Most recommended .
579997	583640	30602	9.0	Excellent short rarely seen these days	This is an excellent cartoon with a great score that is not aired on television these days because 1 ) it has the temerity to be in black and white and 2 ) Porky imitates Cab Calloway at one point and that's considered offensive , or so some think , anyway . That's a shame , because there's a beautiful caricature of Paul Whiteman as well and it's just a great short all around . Well worth the effort to track down . Highly recommended .
578908	583640	24006	9.0	Disney's first take on Noah	This short was Disney's first visit to Noah-it was followed up 26 years later by Noah's Ark . Of the two , this one is much closer to the typical Disney animated short and this one is very good . The other is more unusual in style and format , but both are fairly successful in what they try to do . Good to see this in-print . Beautifully executed . Recommended .
579894	583640	112691	9.0	Yet another episode in the saga of Wallace and Gromit	This short , which won an Academy Award , is the one I enjoy slightly less of the first three , which makes it only great ! A sheep named Shaun steals the show here . Wallace is marginally more lively in this one . All in all , well worth seeking out and fairly easy to get . Highly recommended .
578893	583640	213898	9.0	Will Vinton Studios stretches its muscles a bit .	While Will Vinton and the studio carrying his name are best known for Claymation ( a term coined and either copyrighted or service marked by Vinton , but also a good general description of the animation style ) , the studio and / or Vinton does occasionally produce works directed by others in other styles . The Creation is an excellent example . Mr . Resistor is yet another . Using stop-motion , this is a much more serious piece than the typical Vinton release , though there are some humorous touches . Anyone looking for a pile of giggles is apt to be disappointed . But the short is engaging , the animation is top-notch and the production values are up to the usual high standards . As Vinton was shown the door ( abruptly and rather unceremoniously ) earlier this year , by the partner who recently acquired a larger interest in the studio , also this year , it's highly unlikely that much effort will be expended on less profitable things such as short animation , which is sad , because you can test out ideas and techniques in short films first , without the financial risks inherent in features . Part of the reason Disney was so financially successful early on was the success they had in training crews on shorts and learning what worked ( and didn't ) an the smaller ( comparatively cheaper ) projects . I hope I'm wrong , because animated shorts are an art form in and of themselves and the Will Vinton Studios were very good at them . Recommended .
579831	583640	52389	9.0	Beautifully shot , watch this for the visually glorious surroundings and try to ignore the occasionally silly narraion	This documentary is one of the best ever produced by Disney and has both the strengths and weaknesses of most Disney documentaries-excellent visually and technically but with narration that is all too frequently vapid , silly and boring , with the added difficulty that the narrator's droning monotone almost puts me to sleep . The visuals more than make up for any shortcomings . Recommended .
578937	583640	150096	9.0	This was made early in the Paramount Famous Studio's existence , when they were still funny !	This short was a marked contrast to much of the later output of the Famous Studios for Paramount , which was hackneyed and trite in comparison . Famous Studio was a pale successor to the Fliescher Studio and couldn't even come close to the " Big Three " - Disney , Warner Brothers and MGM-but this cartoon is actually clever , creative and funny . I want to discuss it in a little detail , so there will be spoilers below : Herman is a mouse and wants cheese-he wants it badly . The only problem is , there is a cat and that cat is best friends with the dog . The upshot is , Herman has to get past both of them to get cheese . His success in this effort can be measured by the fact that he hasn't eaten in 29 days ! He decides that his only chance is to make the dog and cat enemies , so that they'll wipe each other out , leaving him a clear and uncontested path to the refrigerator . He tries this by rather crude methods and it briefly looks like he'll succeed , but the cat and dog tumble to his schemes and trick him ( the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry and all that ) . They fake a final , mutually fatal , battle and Herman strolls to the refrigerator , only to find he's been tricked . The last part of the short is fairly good and I won't spoil it here , but it is in keeping with the overall mood of the short . Warmer Brothers did similar work and did it better , but this is a very good short , particularly when measured against the later work of the same studio just a few years later . Well worth tracking down and not that hard to find . Most recommended .
579713	583640	35790	9.0	Excellent footage with an unnecessary , tacked-on , prologue	This Oscar-winning documentary features some spectacular battle footage and is generally well-done , except for the Hollywood hokum grafted onto the beginning , for who knows what reason . It's ridiculous and boring . just ignore it and watch the documentary . The documentary , sans lead-in , is recommended highly .
579656	583640	60834	9.0	Very good but typical Pink Panther cartoon	This cartoon was nominated for a Academy Award . It's a fairly good cartoon , although it is quite similar to The Pink Phink in conception , tone and execution . Not really a terribly novel cartoon by any means , but great fun and very entertaining . Recommended .
579489	583640	22158	9.0	One of their best , it's got the best opening credits sequence of all time	Though I happen to like other Marx Bros . films better , this ranks right up there with their best ! The credits at the beginning are some of the best i've seen ! Typical Marx action , lots of slapstick and visual action mixed with Groucho's wisecracks , much of which I suspect was ad-libbed . Very funny and well worth your time .
579144	583640	28010	9.0	The screwball comedy of all time and one of the biggest head-scratchers in Academy Award history ! ! !	This film is an absolute joy to watch ! With an exceptional cast , four of whom were nominated for Oscars ( one in each of the four categories , although I personally think Eugene Pallette should have been nominated instead of Mischa Auer for Supporting Actor ) , a delightfully witty script that was also nominated for an Oscar and with excellent direction by Gregory LaCava , who made it six nominations all told for the film . Here comes the head-scratcher : no nomination for Picture in a year when TEN films got nominated ! ! ! For one nominee ( libeled Lady ) , Picture was the only nomination it got ! ! ! All in all , one of the more peculiar actions in Academy history . Ironically , William Powel was in both My Man Godfrey and Libeled Lady . Bells and whistles go off and cannons roar and peace and joy reign all throughout the land ! Most Recommended ! ! !
579834	583640	39711	9.0	Thoroughly charming and engaging cartoon	This is one of the most delightful cartoons Disney made in the 1940s , as well as being a very effective showcase for Pluto . Good use of music as well . Nominated for an Oscar in 1947 , this shows up every so often on Disney Channel's The Ink and Paint Club . Recommended .
579785	583640	150462	9.0	Excellent adaptation of the fairy tale with the vocal talent of the great Hans Conreid	This is a wonderful adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale , done with typical attention to detail by the UPA studio and featuring the voice of Hans Conreid . Given his rich and distinctive voice , it is hardly surprising that Conreid did quite a bit of voice work in animation , both narration and character acting . While never identified as the primary vocal talent for a studio , Conreid did work for most of them , particularly Lantz and Disney . He's perfect here , appropriately gullible and smarmy by turns . Well worth the effort to track down . Recommended .
579319	583640	37831	9.0	Marvelous short . One of his best .	This short is wonderful ! Take a pilgrim that sounds a lot like Droopy , add a turkey who sounds like Jimmy Durante , add a bear wearing a sandwich sign , let Tex Avery stir it all together and you have a great cartoon . Sight gags everywhere , especially the bear ( typical Avery running gag ) but beware ye old edited print off ye Cartoon Network-this is a classic . Most definitely worth looking for . Most recommended .
578858	583640	28123	9.0	The trapper becomes the trapped !	This is a very well done short which was directed by Frank Tashlin , who had the distinction of directing both animated shorts and live-action features . He did quite a bit , yet , to the general public , his name probably isn't as familiar as Chuck Jones's is , or perhaps Friz Freleng or Bob Clampett . His work was very good . As I will be commenting somewhat on this short , this is a spoiler warning : Porky Pig is the guardian of the animals in the woods and he puts up sign after sign , making trapping , fishing , hunting , fires ( and just about anything else ) illegal . So , of course , a trapper comes along , finds all the signs incredibly funny and does everything he isn't supposed to do . Here come two beavers ( probably brothers-they fight too much with each other to be friends ) who both try and get some fruit off a string placed above a trap . One of them gets caught and the other rushes off to find Porky . Porky frees the little beaver and quite a few other animals from various traps . There's a scene where the various animals go in one door of Porky's cabin with obvious injuries , only to come out another door with their injuries healed . The trapper discovers that all his traps have been sprung , but are empty and goes looking for whoever emptied his traps . He finds Porky and starts beating on him something fierce . An animal spots this and sends out a distress signal . Animals pour out of every corner of the woods to return the favor and rescue Porky . This is not a good time to be the trapper . He gets attacked from all sides by all kinds of animals and winds up trying to flee them on skis , with no luck ( he's even attacked by turtles-in snow , no less ! ) . He finally winds up buried upside down in the snow and there is much rejoicing . The final gag is cute . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 , which is a very good set , just like the three earlier releases . Recommendations for both this short and the whole collection .
579441	583640	69281	9.0	Really a two actor tour de force	This film is really all about Michael Caine and Sir Laurence Olivier . While the script is excellent and with fine direction , if the two leads aren't dead spot on , the film dies . Despite a tendency to ham it up a bit on occasion , Caine and Olivier are solid most of the film . The ending is a real shocker as well . The byplay between the two is worth watching all by itself as they try and steal scenes from each other ! Most recommended .
579541	583640	67073	9.0	Darwin made funny !	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is admittedly not incredible . You will not be awed by it nor will you be stirred or moved . That said , it is screamingly funny ! ! I found it delightful and a pleasure to watch ! Another excellent production of the National Film Board of Canada ! Most recommended .
579862	583640	29546	9.0	Music by Gershwin , dancing by Astaire and Rogers , with Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore in tow	This film ( one of the better ones Astaire and Rogers did ) probably doesn't get quite the praise it merits because Top Hat and The Gay Divorcee are so widely praised ( rightly so ) . But this movie is equally well executed and any movie that has in it's score the songs , " Shall We Dance " , " Let's Call the Whole Thing Off " and especially " They Can't Take That Away " deserves to be warmly remembered . There's a score by Gershwin , dancing by Astaire , Rogers and others and Edard Everett Horton and Eric Blore in support ( they appeared in so many of the Astaire-Rogers films that their casting must have been legally required ! ) . Well worth your time . Recommended .
578814	583640	152771	9.0	Early Pete Smith Short	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a very early short narrated by Pete Smith . It is fairly representative of the style of short he would become noted for : broadly comic narration , good camera work and effects for a short subject and covering a somewhat offbeat topic in a comical , somewhat jocular manner . Turner Classic Movies runs this as filler between features occasionally and virtually every March for the 31 Days of Oscar . Not his best but well worth catching . Recommended .
578870	583640	29426	9.0	Tex Avery's importance to Warner Brothers ( and animation ) is evident	This cartoon was the start for Daffy Duck . So Tex Avery played a significant part in the development of Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig and developed the character ( Egghead ) who grew into Elmer Fudd . This is a good short to watch to see how Avery and Clampett worked together . Not a seminal cartoon , save for Daffy , but well worth watching . Tex Avery was a very successful man , who by all accounts , was never really sure he ever managed to do much of lasting importance . Most assuredly , he did quite a bit . Recommended .
579155	583640	62353	9.0	Excellent cartoon from the National Film Board of Canada	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a very funny and very pointed satire that really deserves to be more widely seen than it has been . Produced under the auspices of the NFBC , it scores points in quite a few areas , lampooning aspects of modern culture . Produced in 1967 , the points it makes are just as cogent and valid today . Until recently , Cartoon Network showed this occasionally on the very late-night series , O Canada , which , sadly , is not currently airing . Cartoons are not just for children and much of the output from the National Film Board of Canada shows that they understand this . Try and catch this somewhere if you can . It's most definitely worth seeing . Most recommended .
578910	583640	27397	9.0	Wherein the honorable oversigned discusses a favorite short and also his philosophy on comments .	This Popeye is one of my favorite shorts and my pick for one of the better ones in the series . My favorite character , one J . Wellington Wimpy , is prominently featured ( with an amusing twist on his own well-known catch-phrase ) and Bluto is smarmy , rude and surly , even for Bluto . A little something for almost everyone in this one . A little gem . Well worth watching and most recommended . I've heard from a fair number of people about some of my specific comments , but also occasionally on my comments in general . So I decided to put down my approach to comments in general : As a rule , I confine my comments to things I have ( though there are exceptions ) and to things I have liked ( also with exceptions ) . Thus , there will be very few killer comments . Even when something I want to review doesn't quite work for me , I will say what I liked as well as what I didn't and leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide if it interests them . Different people like different things . Finally , I tend to review animated shorts , as animation tends to get short shrift , even here at the IMDb . There you have it , ladies and gentleducks . For any who are curious ( all three of you in the balcony ) , that's my policy on comments .
579411	583640	33956	9.0	Lots of visual gags in this one .	This short has a different villain , a different voice for Olive Oyl and is toward the latter stages of the Fleischers ' run doing cartoons for Paramount . The gags are more visual than verbal here as Popeye once again must save Olive from a fate worse than death . Great animation and well worth watching . Recommended .
579207	583640	41785	10.0	One of the best in the rabbit's career .	This is an excellent cartoon . While by their nature , cartoons are a visual medium and sight gags are a major part of most Warner Brothers shorts , Bugs Bunny is probably the most verbally oriented character they created and the best gags here are verbal in nature , rather than visual . This should be out on video and / or DVD . Hopefully , the much anticipated , long-overdue release on DVD will happen soon . It is much deserved . Well worth watching . Most highly recommended .
579075	583640	85548	10.0	Yet another triumph from the National Film Board of Canada	This documentary , which won an Oscar for Documentary Short , shows a dance class in session with the students being shown how to dance flamenco . Interspersed between shots of the students practising steps and dancing , the instructors are interviewed . It's a fascinating view of a beautiful style of dance as well as proof that some people are most fortunate to be able to do something they love for a living . The National Film Board of Canada was involved in overseeing this production and has consistently produced excellent work for more than sixty years .
579309	583640	106961	10.0	Monty Python meets Orson Welles over the body of Franz Kafka with spectacular results !	Franz Kafka is probably still spinning over this one almost ten years after the fact . There are echos of suspense in this one , but mostly it resembles Python at its full-bore , full throttle best . In fact , if I'm not mistaken , the costumer here also did costumes for The Python series . Too many moments to pick anything out , but it is absolutely wonderful . The incredibly serious among you will probably gnash teeth and pound thy breasts over the violation of Kafka , but the sufficiently twisted will love this ! This won the Academy Award for Live-Action Short ( in a tie with Trevor , he noted for accuracy's sake ) and it's good to see this in print and available . Most highly recommended .
579271	583640	43857	10.0	Greater damage is done trying to do good in life ( and cartoons ) !	I believe it was Thoreau who said , " If I knew that a man were coming to my home with the fixed intention of doing me good , I would flee for my very life . " Tom develops amnesia and Jerry and Mammy try to " help " him recover his memory . While Jerry's efforts are not entirely altruistic ( Tom's rather irritating behaving like a rather large mouse ) Tom is better off as a cat . But the best laid plans of mice and men don't go very well here , with painfully obvious and hilarious results . Lots of great sight gags and semi-vocal effects for Tom . Well worth looking for and most recommended .
579016	583640	38998	10.0	Given the torture this guy goes through trying to cures his hiccoughs , I think I'd keep them , myself !	This is another of the Pete Smith Specialities , which was co-written and directed by Dave O'Brien , who plays the poor fool with the hiccoughs . He tries various " remedies " to " cure " himself ( some of which Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition might have applauded ) to no avail . It's all great fun , for everyone but the poor twit . O'Brien frequently played a character not likely to be joining Mensa any time soon in these shorts . This runs on TCM as filler fairly often and virtually every March as part of the " 31 Days of Oscar " . Most recommended .
579054	583640	30357	10.0	Atypical Popeye , with no fisticuffs ad showing the essential natures of the three principal characters .	This Popeye , set on New Year's Eve , doesn't feature a brawl over Olive , or over anything else , for that matter . Popeye . a good-natured sort , decides it's not right that Olive's grandma be left at home while they go out , so he invites her along . Bluto escorts Olive and they both find it amusing that Popeye asked out grandma . Popeye is the soul of courtesy to grandma . A perfect example of the type of small kindnesses the world can never have enough of , then or now . Wimpy puts in a cameo ( with a different voice ) and the ending is quite funny . Listen for some of Jack Mercer's asides . This is a wonderful cartoon altogether different in mood and tone from the standard Popeye shorts , appropriately so , for the New Year's Eve setting . I wish all who read this a happy and healthy year . This short is well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
579658	583640	72431	10.0	An incredibly funny and affectionate send-up of the horror film in general and Frankenstein films in particular	There really isn't much I can say that doubtless someone else hasn't said . Brooks used the same location and sets that were used for the lab scenes in the original 1931 James Whale version . Anyone who doesn't laugh at either the scene with Gene Hackman as a blind hermit or the scene where Marty Feldman and Gene Wilder are discussing the brain that Feldman brought for transplant has absolutely no pulse whatsoever . Gloriously funny from start to finish . Kenneth Mars is a hoot and Liam Dunn is a scream in one of the most painful-looking funny scenes in cinematic history ! Most Highly Recommended .
578829	583640	98634	10.0	Words cannot do this justice-it must be seen !	This is a short , sharp , delightful cartoon that cannot be adequately described by mere words . It must be seen to be fully appreciated . The director must truly have a fondness for the western , to have so fully captured the atmosphere , right up to the end , when I sat dumb-struck and then almost rolled out of my chair because I laughed so hard my sides hurt ! Gloriously funny and well worth the effort to hunt it up . Most joyously recommended .
578882	583640	45095	10.0	One of several cartoons using the need for quiet as a springboard for typical Avery bedlam	More than once , Tex Avery used the idea that it was in someone's best interests to maintain quiet and someone else wanted the opposite . Here we have a bear with an almost pathological hatred of noise ( except his own ) . Efforts to maintain quiet result in sight gags galore of the usual variety in an Avery cartoon and are very funny . The bear steals the cartoon . Most recommended .
579553	583640	51101	10.0	My absolute favorite Pepe LePew	This is without a doubt my favorite cartoon by a somewhat overshadowed character . A takeoff on Charles Boyer , Pepe has some great lines in this one and the opening of the cartoon is just a riot ! Although I do have some sympathy for the dog . The reason I love this cartoon is that I agree with one of Pepe's observations about fish in the sea , but don't call it a weakness ! sigh
579153	583640	71853	10.0	The person who wrote this review will be sacked ! ( No sub-titles-I promise ! )	There probably isn't much I can say that others haven't said already and at some length , I suspect , so I'll say this : what Rocky Horror Picture Show is to a great many people , this film is to me . I know most of the dialogue , the songs the minstrels sing , the timing and so on . I have probably seen this film more than any other and it never gets old for me . Sheer antic lunacy on a par with The Marx Brothers and glorious fn all round ( I feel happy , I feel happy ! < Whap ! > Most stupendously , wonderfully , delightfully recommended . ( When you're King , you have to know these things . )
578985	583640	65901	10.0	It breaks my heart that this is not in print and I wish I had a copy !	For some time now , it has been a self-imposed policy not to comment on things I don't have a copy of , but I'm breaking that here because I don't want this one to go unregarded any longer . I've seen this twice , the first time almost thirty years ago and it burned its way into my brain then and has stayed there . A blend of still photography and very limited animation , it looks and feels like the old UPA cartoons from the 1950s , which is understandable , because the producer of this , Nick Bosustow , is the son of Steve Bosustow , who produced the UPA shorts . In order for limited animation to work , there has to be something that hooks the audience . That something is the narration , and boy , does it work ! The voice of Orson Welles is perfect for this , as are the script and the visuals . Everything blends together perfectly to create a memorable and totally riveting experience . That this is not in circulation through syndication or by being in print and generally available disappoints me more than I can say . When you look through history , you find that a great deal of damage has been done by people who are thoroughly and totally convinced that they are RIGHT and everyone else is WRONG , mostly about things theological . This cartoon questions that unshakeable belief people have about ( fill in the blank ) and does so beautifully . I cannot recommend this more highly . If you ever get to see this , by all means , do so !
579822	583640	22127	10.0	Betty holds her own in this early short in the series	This one consists principally of sight gags that arise out of Bimbo's mooning after Betty and both Betty and Bimbo dealing with the interest shown in Betty by a rather persistent and quite obvious suitor . Bimbo making cow eyes and chasing after Betty is fairly standard . The older fellow is what makes this one fascinating , for me at least . It's nice occasionally to have someone other than Bimbo or KoKo trying to catch Betty . The Betty Boop personality is formed by this point , for the most part . The music is good , the comic timing is pretty good and the animation is excellent . Part of the Definitive Betty Boop box set and well worth having . Recommended .
579528	583640	58472	10.0	The first Pink Panther short and probably the best	This Academy Award-winning short was the first Pink Panther theatrical release ( at least as a short subject ) and is a winner on all counts . Hilarious , well animated , marvelous story and use of music-everything is wonderful . There wee other very good shorts in the series , but none of them even came close to equaling this first one . I've always felt sorry for the poor little guy in this cartoon ! Most highly recommended .
578884	583640	36238	10.0	A Tex Avery Christmas ! ! !	This cartoon , which I think is one of Tex Avery's best , features as its protagonist a little pig who seems to be a take-off on Red SKelton's Mean Widdle KId character-the voice , mannerisms and even on or two of SKelton's catch-phrases are present in this cartoon . The Wolf doesn't stand a chance ! Junior isn't very well-behaved and is down-right dangerous . He makes Dennis the Menace look like Little Lord Fauntleroy ! Typical Tex Avery sight-gags , but more verbal humor than usual for an Avery short . From downtown at the buzzer , he shoots , he scores ! The Crowd goes wild ! This is an excellent cartoon . Most highly Recommended ! ! !
579260	583640	449619	10.0	Deservedly won an Oscar last year , much as Ryan won the year before	This short is a combination of animation , still photos and what look like home movies in trying to create an imaginary conversation between a father and his son . Like Ryan , which was an animated look at the life and troubles of animator Ryan Larkin's life , this short looks at very real people and situations and , like Ryan , it also won the Oscar for Animated Short . Because I want to at least touch on some of the details , this is a spoiler warning : This short is a conversation going on in the head of its creator , John Canemaker between he and his father and is basically Canemaker's questioning his father about his actions and the events in his life which wound up putting the father on trial for arson and eventually resulting in the incarceration of his father for five years . It's a fascinating story , told primarily by the voices of the father and son , ably done by actors Eli Wallach and John Turturro . Anyone who says that voice work isn't really truly a full acting performance may technically be right , but the performances in this short should at least prove that you can turn in a memorable performance even if you're just providing the voice alone . Just about every emotion you would expect to come out in a conversation between a parent and a child with a significantly adversarial relationship is found here-anger , rage , frustration , irritation , accusation , pain and love are quite apparent in both men as the son tries to find out what precisely happened and why his father went to jail for arson for five years in the early 1950s . As you get deeper in , however , it becomes clear that this is just the most significant problem in a string of problems between father and son , most revolving around the father's temper and the short fuse which causes that temper to be frequently displayed . The animation is simple but quite effective and appropriate to the subject matter . At times , the animation appears to be deliberately child-like and it feels like Canemaker is trying to show the reaction of a confused , frightened and hurt eight year old ( which was how old he was when his father went to jail ) . The animation basically fits with the mood of the short . This short is really difficult to describe in words which will do it justice , as it really should be seen . Fortunately , it and most of the other 2005 shorts nominees are available on a compilation DVD featuring all five Live-Action Shorts and three of the five Animated Shorts ( the other two animated nominees weren't included because Pixar presumably had plans to release One Man Band and 9 has been optioned to be turned into a feature film ) . Highly recommended .
579956	583640	36244	10.0	Haunting story of a " mob mentaity " and what happens when people lose control	This is one the best westerns and better films I have ever seen and features a very fine , almost understated , performance by Henry Fonda and excellent work by a host of familiar faces , most notably early work by Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn . Fans of movies from the 1930s and 1940s will recognize lots of character actors like Harry Davenport and Jane Darwell . But this movie and what it says about human behavior and crowd psychology is quite unsettling and thought-provoking . I'm surprised that it was only nominated for one Academy Award , even if it was Picture . Normally , I would make some exuberant , lighthearted comment with a film I think this highly of , but it would be out of place here . This film is that intensely disturbing . I most certainly recommend this film .
579605	583640	81361	10.0	The best of the more recent additions to the older works	Although they've mostly worked , the cartoons done in the 1970's and after usually aren't quite as good as the older stuff ( probably because budgets and cost won't allow the same freedom ) . This one and a few others are the exception . I put this one above the two most notable others ( The Duxorsist and Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th and a Century ) because it has some funnier lines and situations and a very funny cameo by none other than Wile E . Coyote . Chuck Jones did a marvelous job with this one and it is highly recommended .
578777	583640	38087	10.0	One good short deserves an even better remake .	Dangerous Dan McFoo , a short that Tex Avery directed at Warner Brothers , is re-made here some six years later , when Tex was at MGM . This cartoon is a bit crisper , with better timing , although both are quite good and both unmistakably Tex Avery cartoons . The Robert W . Service poem that serves as the starting point for both is used to much better effect here and Avery had six more years worth of practice honing his timing on his much-loved sight gags . The pacing is better here and it's just a better cartoon . Tex Avery was one of the giants of his field , working at a time when the animated short was significant , at least moreso than it is today . Many of his conventions are still used today . Too bad he didn't really seem to understand his impact while he was alive . From all reports , he felt that he'd been largely forgotten and had done little that would last . The work remains , but like most truly funny men , his personal life was a less than happy one . Excellent cartoon . Well worth seeking out . Most highly recommended .
579129	583640	190287	10.0	So help me , I don't know why , but I enjoy this carton ! ! !	Normally , I am not overly fond of terminally cute cartoons or country music . This cartoon is guilty on both counts . With all that going on , I should really run screaming from this one , but I don't . Maybe it's just sufficiently bizarre below the surface to be good , or maybe I'm getting sentimental in my dotage . No matter-the animation is top-notch and it's a well-done short , for all it's cuteness . From behind the net , he takes the puck and fires it past the goalie and he scores to win the Cup ! ! ! Recommended .
579741	583640	23027	10.0	One of the Marx Brothers ' best !	What the Marx Brothers do to higher education in this film is roaringly funny , from the opening song " Whatever It Is , I'm Against It " to the end , possibly the most bizarre American Football " game " not played in the XFL ! Groucho was at or near his best and it's probably the best ( and most significant ) role Zeppo ever had . Most highly recommended .
579744	583640	49473	10.0	An excellent combination of live-action footage and animation that holds up very well	This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why . Even 45 years later , it is quite an impressive piece of work . Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain . Good use of live footage and animation in tandem . This used to run as part of " Vault Disney " every few months or so , but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while . sigh Most recommended .
578769	583640	38253	10.0	Masterful use of the character of Droopy and the running gag .	As the creator of the character , it's understandable that Tex Avery would be best able to utilize him to best effect . Most of the Droopy shorts made after Tex left MGM don't really use the character as effectively , giving him too much dialogue or making him to soft-hearted and without an edge to him . Droopy has teeth and can use them . But , really , what Droopy is , and probably intended to be all along , is a simple character to react to things and bounce things off of , a sort of subtle focus point the audience can be drawn to and relate to , but who doesn't distract from the sight gags . Watch for Droopy's appearances in this one-he pops up unexpectedly in some amusing places . There's also a great running gag here that may well be his best running gag , certainly the best Avery used while at MGM ( the one at the core of The Legend of Rockabye Point may be better , but I love that cartoon so much , I could be biased in its favor ) and running gags were a staple in Avery cartoons . Most of them had at least one . Good cartoon and the ending is great . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579960	583640	29339	10.0	The attention to detail is breathtaking !	The folks at Disney won an Oscar for this astonishing piece of work and deservedly so ! It's got to be one of the most meticulously done animations I have seen in my life ! The detail work is inspired and it's apparent that a great deal of time , effort and creativity was given to this gem . While it isn't available commercially ( like far too much of the shorter animation done for the Mouse ) , it do run on the Ink and Paint Club periodically . I wish they would release more of the animated shorts and the live-action shorts and documentaries they did in the 1940's and 1950's . sigh The puck is on his stick , he's skating for the net , he shoots , he scores and the place goes crazy ! Most unreservedly recommended .
579336	583640	46973	10.0	Not one of Claude's better days , I'd imagine .	This is my favorite of the shorts starring Marc Anthony , though one of the others , Cat Feud , is a better cartoon . Claude Cat is thoroughly unlikeable in this one . He's deceitful , disgraceful and devious and those are his good qualities ! Marc Anthony ( clearly a dog's equivalent to Prince Valiant ) wins out for the cause and for Truth , Justice and the American Way ( oops , wrong hero ) and the dim bulb that is the human " master " finally realizes that Claude's been playing him like a pipe organ in church . Marc Anthony's final ruse to get inside is priceless , as are Claude's facial expressions as the plot unfolds . The ending is marvelous and Claude's exit line is perfect . Well worth tracking down and watching . Most recommended .
579003	583640	47001	10.0	Makes Walter Mitty look like an under-achiever !	Nominated for an Oscar , this cartoon is a takeoff on Walter Mity , with a small boy named Ralph Phillips surpassing Mitty in inventiveness . Thoroughly engaging and extremely hilarious , the situations Ralph imagines are wonderful and so off-beat ( particularly his bout with mathematics ! ) that the cartoon can be watched again and again without getting old or growing flat . Most highly recommended .
579907	583640	22667	10.0	I'd vote for her any day !	This is a wonderful mix of satire and the strangeness that could be found in the best of the early Fleischer shorts , particularly Betty Boop cartoons . A knowledge of 1930s politics helps with some of the jokes , but it's funny even if you don't know who Herbert Hoover or FDR were . These shorts are exceptionally fine work in many cases and are always enjoyable to watch , at least through 1934 or so . Even the ones done later are reasonably good , even if Warner Brothers and MGM had by then surpassed what the Fleischers were doing . In print and available . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
579026	583640	179025	10.0	This PBS series got me hooked on animation !	This series ran for three seasons on PBS and , like the overwhelming majority of the shows produced for that network , was of excellent quality and had to have been assembled by people who had a love for the subject matter . The shorts that ran on the series ran the gamut from deathly serious ones like Sisyphus ( a Hungarian short ) to the delightful short Great ( a British Academy Award winner ) and every possible spot on the line between . Work from all over was featured , from The National Film Board of Canada , the Eastern Europeans , the United States , the United Kingdom , ranging from shorts done for children to things like Closed Mondays by Will Vinton . Different animation styles , from 2-D hand drawn to puppet and Claymation , were featured . The intent was simply to showcase the best short animation available to PBS . The usual suspects-Warner Brothers , Disney , MGM-weren't featured , but they didn't need the exposure . These shorts did and finally found something approaching the audience they deserved . It's been 25 years since this first came on the air and more than 20 since it ended . Some extraordinary things have been done in the intervening years . It would be wonderful if perhaps PBS or someone would put together a show similar to this in concept to give animation like this more of an audience these days . No matter . Thanks to this show , I discovered a whole side of animation I barely glimpsed before , here and there and for that I'll always be thankful . I wish I could see some of these again , though .
579929	583640	53909	10.0	Excellent use of classical music and a very amusing concept	This short , nominated for an Oscar , is one of Chuck Jones's best . You'll never hear The Blue Danube in the same way again . Extremely creative joining of animation and music . One slight correction of another comment on this short : I know I saw this short on television prior to 1977 , because I saw it for the first time before I turned 18 . In any case , Cartoon Network has aired this fairly recently and if I recall correctly , showed it one New Years Eve , as part of a special broadcast . I think it was in 1999 as part of the " Miloony-um " special . Most highly recommended .
579971	583640	29151	10.0	Beautifully crafted short all the more remarkable for the studio that did such exceptional work here .	Charles Mintz saw gold in them there cartoons and thus jettisoned Walt Disney and the contractual relationship they had to start in-house production and make ( he thought ) even more for himself . But Mintz had a gourmand's palate without the imagination or financial willingness to feed such tastes . Columbia was rarely to come even within shouting distance of Disney , MGM and Warner Brothers where animated shorts were concerned . They just didn't much take the time or effort to go beyond nice , enjoyable fluff to fulfill contractual obligations . That makes The Little Match Girl all the more incredible , because it's an emerald awash in a sea of shiny marbles . Much of the credit can go to Al Davis and Sid Marcus , both exceptionally talented . This is probably the crown jewel in Davis's career , a compliment , to say the least . They manage to make this endearing and heart-wrenching without it becoming maudlin or cloying . It's a remarkable piece of work and , had it been more properly promoted at the time , might have won the Academy Award ( and probably should have ) . I don't usually go into detail about the contents of a film , preferring to let the film speak for itself , but one point I need to make : the decision to make the child smaller than normal in perspective to the world around he was brilliant-to a child , the " grownup " world is huge and more than a bit scary . It works wonderfully . That this isn't in print and available is a shame , as it should be . Well worth hunting up . Most highly recommended .
579355	583640	15864	10.0	One of the all-time classics !	If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability , t you a commend this film , as well as City Lights . Modern Times isn't , strictly speaking , a silent film , although Chaplin had no dialogue there . The Gold Rush , while not Chaplin's best film , does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits , it must be seen . Excellent film . 1942 version redone by Chaplin is a bit better , but either will do . Most highly recommended .
579375	583640	163175	10.0	Excellent combining of live-action and animation	This cartoon effectively combines live-action footage with animation in a very funny but also thoughtful short . It explores desires and dissatisfaction on two very different sides of an atypical fence as an ambitious " toon " has a job interview with a bored and vaguely unhappy " human " and concludes with an entertaining resolution to the interview . Most enjoyable and memorable . Highly recommended . NFB of C did it again !
579600	583640	73068	10.0	Very aptly titled	Great is , quite simply , great ! A funny , warm , poignant look a real-life builder named Isambard Kingdom Brunel . I wish it was in-print . It's a masterwork . It deserves better than to languish in an obscurity it most definitely does not deserve .
579287	583640	40515	10.0	The enemy of my enemy is my friend .	Tom can't seem to catch a break-he not only has Jerry to chase ( difficult in and of itself , as witness his monumental failure rate ) , but a little yellow bird sticks his beak in matters at the most inopportune ( for Tom ) moments . An important object lesson is taught to the two allies at a point of seeming success : premature celebration may be hazardous to one's longevity of health and / or life . Save the congratulations for a safer time and place . Most entertaining and executed short from when Tom and Jerry were definitely in flower . Well worth watching and most highly recommended .
