579340	583640	118979	1.0	If there's a film worse than this one , I don't want to see it	I happened to catch this on a premium channel a while back and I've got news for you : it makes Showgirls look like Casablanca or Gone With the Wind by comparison . I'm one who happens to believe that the merits of a film are to a degree relative ; you don't judge Bikini Carwash by comparing it to , say , Schindler's List , as an example . But for the type of movie , compared to others in the same vein , it's lousy . I don't bore easily at all , but this one did that in spades . If you want something like this , look for Kira Reed in the cast and it's probably worth seeing . But this one reeks !
578788	583640	59322	5.0	Why was this cartoon made ?	While I've seen worse , I kept thinking that this cartoon would have no reason to exist save for the fact that Warner Brothers had a contractual obligation to supply a certain number of shorts to movie theaters , so they fiddled around with film stock , yawned and sent this one out on an unsuspecting and somewhat indifferent world . While my view of the later Warner output is more charitable than others feel is warranted , a few miss the mark for me . This is one . Worth watching once . Recommended for completists .
579024	583640	152030	5.0	Disappointing cartoon , to say the least .	This cartoon has its moments , but most of them are the ones found in the old Fleischer Studios footage that comprises about seven minutes out of the running length , but less than half of the original cartoon . The original most of this was cribbed from is infinitely better than the framing material and the re-looped dialogue can't begin to equal the original . I find the new animation irritating at best . Watch the source cartoon instead . This is a waste of time and is just sad by the inevitable ( unavoidable , really ) comparison of the Fleischer Studios work to that of the later Famous Studios Paramount efforts . Others may find this worthwhile , but I certainly don't .
579230	583640	262480	5.0	This one just didn't work for me .	This one did not impress me very much . I don't care for the Beat movement at all , the animation was marginal at best , the POINT was so obvious that I felt that the writer / director was beating me over the head with it most of a very short film and this just didn't work for me on any level . If your tastes run to Beat poetry and polemics , you may enjoy this one . You are thus warned : for me , here there be boredom . It can be found on Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation , Vol 4 , I believe .
579968	583640	22710	5.0	Except for a running gag featuring an eagle in the last part of the short , this one is pretty unmemorable .	There's not much to this short apart from one running gag and a few sight gags . You get a general feeling about the whole , but very little stands out and makes a lasting impression . I will discuss one or two things here , so this is a spoiler warning : The cartoon has some cute gags in the first couple of minutes , with the marching band and what looks like a moose doubling as a turnstile . Intercut in here are scenes of Bosko being tortured under the guise of being given a " massage " ( ouch ! ) . The football game is really not very interesting in and of itself . There are one or two good gags and some horrible puns that pop up . Most of the funny stuff is off the field antics ( a reporter pounding away at his typewriter until the typewriter pounds back , a face appearing in the crowd watching the game in obvious disapproval , etc . ) . Toward the end , they periodically cut away to an eagle perched upon a flagpole . This running bit is far more interesting than the rest of the short and the ending is quite good . I won't spoil it here . Though this cartoon is not all that special , I hope it is released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection at some point . Worth watching once .
578974	583640	22679	5.0	Not much to this particular short , which is limited , even for a Bosko	Though there are a few nice bits in here , there really isn't much substance to this one overall . It's just an average short , with little to interest or bore the general viewer . If you really like Bosko , you'll enjoy it enormously . There will be spoilers from here on out : This short can basically be summed up as follows : See Bosko . See Bruno . See Bosko skate . See Bruno repeat a gag three times and eventually fall through a hole in the ice . See the foregoing take up almost half the cartoon . See Bruno find a baby . See Bosko and Bruno take the very loud baby home and try to make it happy . See Bruno sit on a stove . See baby laugh uproariously . See Bosko play the piano and sing . See baby dance and Bosko and baby sing in " scat " style . See Bosko have an accident and wind up with a fishbowl as headgear . See very mean baby laugh . Iris out . Not the greatest Bosko or the worst Bosko . This short is just " okay " . I do hope , however , that this ultimately does get released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection in the future . Worth watching at least once .
579786	583640	151951	6.0	The title character is aptly named and , to me , thoroughly unappealing	Not a bad cartoon , but one of two ( starring the same character ) that I don't like much . Good use of limited animation , but Pete Hothead is a most unlikable character , which is the point , I suppose . For UPA completeists , though others might not find the character so irritating . Think Donald Duck without feathers and clearer speech .
579659	583640	118747	6.0	Not even nearly as good as the first one as a movie , but , oh that music !	As far as the movie goes , it is pretty lame . The main problem is obvious-Dan Ackroyd and John Goodman don't have the comic timing or rapport that Ackroyd and Belushi did . Not even close . But when yu look at the musicians involved-the Blues Brothers Band , Aretha Franklin , James Brown , the line-up that fills out the Louisiana Gator Boys , Jonny Lang , so many others I probably overlook , that's worth it alone . Buy the CD if it's available . As a movie , it would probably serve better if the negative were cut up and used for guita picks ( except for most of the musical numbers ) . Music-10 , movie-0
579050	583640	20018	6.0	A dated curio that is not without its ' charms , but of somewhat limited interest and appeal .	This film has been of interest to me for some time now , for a number of reasons . I finally managed to get a copy and saw it yesterday . I now understand why it is not currently generally available-it is dated , of , at best , average quality , not without charm or appeal , to be sure , but the interst here is for a relatively small audience . Not a bad film , by any means , just not terribly engaging . I will say that a knowledge of Spanish greatly enhanced my own enjoyment of this film , as two or three very good lines were delivered in Spanish . I have now seen three of the five Academy Award Picture nominees in their entirety ( and am unlikely to ever see one , The Patriot , as it is reportedly a " lost " film ) and part of Alibi . I now understand how Broadway Melody won that year . Of the choices I've seen , it is clearly the best of an average lot . The Patriot may well be better , but I'm unlikely to ever be able to judge that point . I enjoyed the film , warts and all , but it is rather dated . But , for my money , any movie that gives the leading man the nickname , " El Conejito " ( Little Rabbit ) can't be too bad . Worth watching . Recommended to old film buffs and film historians .
578968	583640	20798	6.0	For me , a most annoying cartoon ! ( Rant ahead )	This cartoon almost neatly encapsulates a large part of the problem Iwerks studio had in their work : there is an absolute and almost total disregard for anything not involved with the technical part of animation and backgrounds . Plotting and story are afterthoughts at best ! I don't consider the next commentary to be a spoiler , but it is a rant and thus I will put a space here and you may skip if you choose . This is essentially half a cartoon-just when it starts to get interesting , the plug is pulled and a patch-up ending takes place , probably because the cartoon was long enough for release ! I'd have much preferred that they shorten the setup a couple of minutes and done that two minutes so that the latter part of the cartoon , which strikes me as much more intriguing , was a little stronger . Instead , the best part of the short is just that-short ! Say what you will about Disney-the Mouse got the story down as well as doing beautiful visual work . So did the Fleischers , for the most part . Excellent animation with some beautiful bits and an intriguing premise ultimately wasted . Worth watching , but could have been so much better . A frustrating cartoon .
579952	583640	27468	6.0	Visually nice , but not terribly memorable	This Disney short is well-executed visually ( as you might expect from Disney in the 1930s ) but isn't really all that memorable or impressive for all that . I'm frankly somewhat puzzled at its nomination for an Academy Award and more puzzled that it won . Perhaps it was more impressive in 1936 than it is today . It isn't a bad cartoon-there just isn't anything exceptional about it that struck me other than the visuals . It runs from time to time on the Ink and Paint Club .
578945	583640	32794	7.0	While a decent cartoon , it probably shouldn't have won the Oscar .	This cartoon is done reasonably well , is enjoyable enough and worth seeing , but , although I can understand why it won ( monumentally cute with well-drawn backgrounds and the closest thing to a Disney style short that was nominated ) , I don't think it should have . It's competition included the very first Tom and Jerry and a Bugs Bunny directed by Tex Avery . The Tom and Jerry should have won hands down . The Milky Way has some nice touches , but the other two were more interesting and more novel for the time . Oh , well . The Academy has got more right than wrong in Animated Short over the years . This one shows on The Cartoon Network from time to time .
579305	583640	30289	7.0	Egghead as a romantic lead . I must have missed something .	This is an excellent cartoon , with the incongruous premise that Egghead is a romantic leading man . I can see it now-first , there was Valentino and John Gilbert , then Gable and now Egghead . Oh , well , he's a Tex Avery leading man ! This is a typical Avery short-sight gags come so fast and furious that they almost inundate the audience and you usually need three or four viewings to catch everything . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
579177	583640	142399	7.0	This is an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit which spins its own version of Jack and the Beanstalk	When I saw the title of this short , I thought it might be a play on the Alice in Wonderland story . Strangely enough , it's actually a re-telling of the Jack and the Beanstalk fairy tale , a fairly interesting one at that . As I want to discuss the short , this is a spoiler warning : This short opens with Oswald singing a song about his grandmother sewing a rip in his pants while his grandmother is sewing a rip in his pants-while he's still wearing them ! Granny is being assisted by a rather helpful mouse , who also manages to stick the sleeping cat with the needle at least once . This has all the makings of an old melodrama-the dastardly landlord callously telling granny that if he's not paid the mortgage by six , she gets the boot , complete with maniacal laugh and mustaches . Oswald vows to save the homestead and decides to sell the cow to raise money . A witch materializes from a tree and offers a bag of beans for the cow . There's a really good bit here , where the cow basically becomes a " one cow band " when the sale is completed . The obvious happens-the beans get planted , a beanstalk results and Oswald winds up in a large castle , where he meets a girl who decides to help him . There are some really good visuals , culminating in the two hitching a ride on a spider who doubles as " elevator " - right above the mouth of the sleeping ( and snoring ) giant . They make it over to the chicken ( yes , a chicken ) that lays golden eggs , a rather noisy and complex process . Oswald gets one 14-caret golden egg before the giant wakes up and the chase is on . Why Oswald doesn't grab the chicken and take it is a puzzle , but the chicken disappears during the chase , though the girl remains and she goes down the beanstalk with Oswald , both followed closely by the giant . Meanwhile , back at the old homestead , granny is weeping as the dastardly landlord is cackling that only one minute remains , when Oswald announces his impending arrival . The landlord cuts down the the beanstalk , laughing a somewhat premature victory laugh-the giant hits him and they're both driven into the ground , while Oswald and the girl land safely . There's a victory dance by Oswald , the girl , the cat and the mouse around an improvised maypole and we leave the happy scene , where virtue has once again emerged triumphant-as long as you ignore the fact that Oswald trespassed and stole from the giant , of course . Minor details . This short is available on the DVD Attack of the ' 30s Characters and it is well worth watching . Recommended .
579132	583640	33715	7.0	Not the best Bugs Bunny ever , but well worth watching	This short , nominated for an Oscar , is a good , not great , cartoon . It does introduce a bit of Longfellow and any Bugs Bunny is a good cartoon and worth watching . There just isn't anything terribly funny or special about this particular cartoon besides the poem sections read at the beginning and end . But it is worth watching . It runs periodically on Cartoon Network .
579700	583640	22385	7.0	They were still trying to make Bimbo the star and they still don't really seem to know what they wanted to do with Betty yet .	Very early entry in the series . Betty Boop is still formative in this one ( dog ears are still present ) and they still seem to be feeling their way here . Bimbo is here and a focus of the short is a plot the Fleischers employ to much greater effectiveness later in the Popeye series-a run-in with a magician . They seem to be on the verge of discovering that Betty is a better character ( and certainly better to support a cartoon series ) than Bimbo , who is a reasonable secondary character , but just not substantial enough to build a series around . The bits aren't funny because of Bimbo-he's just there and only occasionally interesting on his own hook . Things just bounce off Bimbo . There's no spark . That can work if a character if there's some characteristic to grab the audience . After all , Mickey Mouse was largely just a foil for gags or a straight man after a while , but Disney invested him with enough personality early on that he grabbed an audience . Bimbo never had that going for him . Good cartoon-nothing special , but worth a look . Recommended to Boop fans .
579538	583640	148673	7.0	A cartoon which answers a question that has puzzled mankind for eons : which one is Heckle and which one is Jeckle ?	A largely run-of-the-mill short that has one very notable point of significance-it essentially makes it possible to know which magpie is Heckle and which one is Jeckle . In order to explain this , spoilers are necessary , so be warned : This is a fairly typical " friends become romantic rivals " cartoon with some enjoyable visual gags . But the most important aspect of this short is that there are a couple of scenes that provide fairly decisive indicators of which bird is which . Though the two birds have distinctive voices and personalities , in most of the shorts , their names are not used in such a way that they identify the specific character . Physically , they look the same . Here , however , they are shown wearing different hats and one wears a monocle . On two different occasions , they are shown running into separate living quarters , each marked by name . The one who comes out of the quarters marked " Heckle " is the one who speaks with a New York , Bronx / Brooklyn accent and is wearing a white hat with upturned brim , while the one who exits from " Jeckle " is wearing a straw hat and a monocle and speaks with a British accent . Heckle and Jeckle are probably the most effective characters developed by Terrytoons , certainly of those developed before Paul Terry sold his shorts and the studio . Mighty Mouse is really the only one who can rival them in terms of success . The Terrytoon shorts were , for the most part , pleasant filler . They weren't innovative-they were done to fulfill a contract to provide a certain number of theatrically released cartoons . Heckle and Jeckle were probably the most consistently entertaining series they did . This short is well worth watching . Recommended .
579752	583640	20983	7.0	Early Bosko , very musically-oriented and with a very bizarre segment !	This is a fairly typical early Bosko and is reasonably amusing . There are one or two points I want to discuss in some detail , some " Here there be spoilers " : This short is musically-oriented and lots of things become musical instruments in the hands of Bosko , his work crew ( a bunch of small , strangely familiar mice ) and Bosko's girlfriend . It is to the temporary misfortune of one particular mouse that Bosko is his foreman . The mouse falls off a wall and lands on a saw , which starts making music . Bosk starts bending and warping the saw to get musical notes from it , which tosses the mouse up into the air . At one point , the mouse comes down on the saw-teeth and his head lands on one side and his body on the other . You then see the head and the body moving around on the saw as Bosko bends and warps it to make music as the body and head frantically try to get back together . Later on in the short , Bosko sees Honey in an office and goes across to her window by using musical notes as steppingstones in mid-air . He proceeds to put sheet music in her typewriter and play it like a piano . The capper on the music from unusual sources is Bosko's use of a goat as bagpipes . This has quite a few of the visual gags that would be used frequently in the Bosko shorts , such as Bosko breaking up into lots of little Boskos after hitting the ground and the playing of music when running across steps or bricks where the path is differentiated enough to resemble a keyboard or a xylophone . Good , if rather standard , Bosko short . Worht watching , if you get the opportunity . Recommended .
579755	583640	46739	7.0	Average short with some hilarious moments	In order to discuss this short , I have to give some details , so there will be spoilers below : This time out , Bugs goes toe-to-toe with a " baby " with a five o'clock shadow and tattoos . Ant-Hill Harry , alias " Baby-faced Finster " , has lost the proceeds of his latest heist down a rabbit-hole . Enter our hero , who believes that this is a real baby at first . The judges ' scorecards give the early rounds to " Finster " , with a knock out saved by the bell in Round Five ( " Finster " swings a mean bat ) . Bugs discovers the truth and wins the later rounds and the fight . " Finster " was fighting out of his weight-class . There are some very good moments in this-the transition from " Finster " wildly swinging a bat to wide-eyed innocence and calling Bugs " Daddy " is beautifully done . Bugs's revenge against " Finster " ( " I do believe I forgot my fudge " ) and his note to the police when he leaves them a " baby " trussed up in a basket is priceless . It almost makes the ending superfluous . This short is on Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 2 . the Collection and this short are both recommended .
579440	583640	31253	7.0	Dated and melodramatic , it makes its ' point nonetheless	This short , nominated for an Oscar , has a dated feeling to it and the melodramatic tne common to the CRime Does Not Pay series of shorts , but for all that does have a point and makes it : the operation of heavy machinery while drunk is most unwise and can prove to be very costly . This runs on Turner Classic Movies as filler between films and almost certainly airs in March as part of the 31 Days of Oscar they do annualy . Worth watching .
578970	583640	22708	7.0	Truly . anything can happen in a cartoon !	This is a fairly good example ( good and bad ) of the Bosko series . I intend to discuss some details , so let this be a spoiler warning : This short opens with Bosko selling hot dogs ( again-this bit was used in an earlier short , as were many other bits throughout the series ) and there are some cute gags with the very active hot dogs . Bruno gets a tack in his paw and Bosko pulls it out , only to toss it back on to the sand carelessly . There's a nice bit ( again a repeat from other shorts ) with an octopus making itself a carousel for some seahorses . Honey brings Wilber to the beach and Wilber proceeds to repeatedly venture near the shore , only to run away at the approaching wave . Gags like that were often repeated , maybe because they thought repetition made them funny or maybe so they could just re-use the same drawings and save some work for themselves . Bosko sees Honey silhouetted under a beach umbrella and they go off to play the ukulele and sing " Ain't We Got Fun ? " together , while playing a game of " Fetch " with Bruno ( one of the funniest bits in the short-watch the sticks Bruno brings back ) . Meanwhile , back at the beach , the predictable happens and Wilber gets caught by the tide and pulled out to sea . There are some really nice visual bits with Bosko trying to swim out to rescue Wilber and Wilber has one very good line of dialog , but there's a lot of recycled footage here . Bruno saves the day by grabbing an electric fan ( with a power cord ) , taking it out to the beach , climbing on a log and using the fan as an outboard motor ( there must have been an outlet in the log ) . Nice short in spots , with Wilber much more tolerable than he often is in other shorts . I hope this ultimately makes it onto a Looney Tunes Golden Collection . Worth watching at least once .
579547	583640	75232	7.0	Good , but not great , musical version of Cinderella	This is a good movie with a good score , a cast full of recognizabe faces , nice costumes and beautiful sets . While certainly not a wonderful film , it is more than worth seeing . The principal problem here is that the movie drags a bit in spots . A bit of judicious editing to shorten it about ten minutes would probably improve the pacing remarkably . The leads actually complement one another quite . A cut above your average costumed musical with more than a few good moments . Worth watching .
578964	583640	141559	7.0	A fairly decent cartoon that holds up well .	This is actually a pretty fair short , for all that it's all but inescapable to compare and contrast with Disney's The Wise Little Hen , given that they have the same fable as a starting point . The Iwerks version is actually as good or better in some respects , but Iwerks was really better off avoiding direct comparison to his once and future employer . They weren't the only studio to make this mistake , as Fleischer Studios also tried to out-Disney Disney , with less than successful results . Still , this is a charming little cartoon with a rather cute little song . Most definitely worth seeing . Recommended .
579046	583640	75294	7.0	Enjoyable farce	The reviewer of this film in Leonard Maltin's Guide called this a bomb . While it is not the greatest movie of all time , there are definitely enough moments that make the movie worth watching . It's probably Beau Bridges ' best work , Avery Schrieber is wonderful , Geoffrey Holder is stupendous and to top it off , James Earl Jones is in the movie ! That alone makes it not a bomb in my book . It's a fun , mindless movie that I found delightful .
579414	583640	53922	7.0	Cute , but nothing very novel here .	This is a cute cartoon , but the gags aren't especially new or inventive here , as many of them are taken from other Warner Brothers shorts , some as bits and pieces and other lifted whole . Still entertaining enough in its own right and worth watching . Recommended .
579836	583640	133794	7.0	More conventional than Richard Condie cartoons generally are and less interesting too	Richard Condie is a master of the odd and unusual in animation . This cartoon is more conventional . I'd have enjoyed it more had I seen it before I saw a few of his other , more bizarre efforts . Slow in spots and essentially one-joke . Tex Avery did one-jokes first and better . Still worth watching .
578921	583640	52056	7.0	Decent cartoon , typical Disney , but nothing exceptional	This longish short was nominated for an Oscar . Decent enough and a fairly good adaptation of the tall tale , but fairly routine Disney and with nothing especially memorable or exceptional about it in any area . Worth watching , this runs infrequently as filler on the Disney Channel during " Vault Disney in the wee hours of the morning .
579564	583640	409799	8.0	Entertaining , if not earthshaking	This was the " weakest " of the five nominees for the Live-Action Short category bestowed by AMPAS , which means it was only very good in a field of excellent shorts . Because I want to discuss the short in a little detail , there will be spoilers : The basic premise is that people who work on the clock at a supermarket during the late shift all have different ways to make the time seem to go by more quickly , ranging from just not looking at the clock through simply goofing off to the most extreme , which is pretending that you've cause time and all movement but your own to come to a full stop . Along the way , we meet a female checkout clerk , the overbearing and absolutely tedious supervisor who keeps trying to impress her ( in vain ) , two arrested development cases , who are 22 going on 12 and the narrator , who is the one who makes time pass by acting like he's stopped it cold . Oh yeah-he also likes to sketch the female shoppers ( at least the prettier ones ) in the nude . His narration is generally entertaining and often funny . It's an entertaining short which may actually make a better feature , as it feels a tad constrained by its brevity . All in all , a good short and well worth watching . This short is available on a compilation DVD containing eight of ten nominees for the two Academy Awards Shorts categories ( two of the Animated Short nominees aren't included ) and it's a very good DVD indeed . Recommended .
579884	583640	45786	8.0	Bugs Bunny joins the Army .	This is a very funny short which plays on a series of coincidences and misunderstandings to put Bugs Bunny in position to be inducted into the United States Army . Because I want to discuss some details , this is a spoiler warning : The short opens with an induction notice being delivered to one " B . Bonny " , only the notice winds up in Bugs Bunny's hole in the ground and he mistakenly assumes it's for him . Thus , we now go off to the physical . The physical is hilarious , with reactions ranging from the nonchalant " So they're inducting rabbits " through nervous laughter to incredulous shock , as when Bugs takes the eye exam and reads the whole chart , fine print included . Bugs obviously passes the physical , because we next see him in boot camp for basic training . His Sargeant looks and sounds like the construction worker Bugs did battle with in a couple of other shorts and he fares about as well here as he did there . Bugs first causes headaches in general for the Sargeant and then gets him into hot water with a Colonel who clearly didn't care much for the Sargeant even before all the problems with Bugs develop . Bugs bowls the colonel over during drill , bathes in the colonels helmet , dresses chickens for the Officer's mess ( he dresses them in tuxedos ) and hammers a nail into the wall using a live shell ! With each passing incident , the Sargeant loses a little more rank , until he's a private . It's at this point that the former Sargeant realizes that Bugs is a rabbit , as it slowly dawns on him that Bugs really isn't " just like all the other guys " . Watching the fog start to lift on the erstwhile Sargeant's comprehension is great ! A compromise of sorts gives Bugs a job at a munitions plant , with a finale that I won't spoil here . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth seeing . Recommended .
578839	583640	21824	8.0	Fun and frolic during wartime	Warfare is not going to get Bosko or Honey down , nosiree ! The title is a play on the film title Dawn Patrol and Warner Brothers made another short 33 years later with the same title . Both are decent , but they started to flesh out the Bosko character at about this point in the series , so this one is better than most , if a bit inane . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579559	583640	28365	8.0	Very cute , beautifully drawn and animated and a lot of fun to watch !	This cartoon , with a very basic and not very significant plot , is loads of fun and very nice to look at . Because I do want to touch on the short to some degree , there are mild spoilers : The title basically says it all-the protagonists are the Three Blind Mouseketeers and they are " all for one and one for all " when it comes to finding cheese . Captain Katt ( think of " Pegleg " Pete done up as a cat ) has sworn that , tonight , he's finally going to trap and destroy the Three Blind Mouseketeers , so he sets traps everywhere , hides inside a split barrel-and promptly falls asleep . The Mouseketeers , in the meantime , through fortuitous circumstances , manage to repeatedly slip through and around the traps with nary a scratch on them , many of the gags being excellently timed animation , frequently timed to the beat . There's one particularly nice bit of animation , where one of the mice becomes isolated from the others and Captain Katt is coming toward him when he starts yelling to his comrades as though he's surrounded by an army , which in a sense , he is-he's standing in front of a great many pieces of reflective glass , each of which has a tiny mouse dressed astonishingly like him and brandishing a sword . Captain Katt is overwhelmed and turns to run . Add in a large quantity of exploding corks from bottles and Captain Katt is once again routed by the Three Blind Mouseketeers . This short is available on the Disney Treasures More Silly Symphonies DVD release and it and the set are recommended .
579613	583640	59043	8.0	Slightly uneven , but unsettling film exploring the dimensions of madness	This film is really a two-character effort . Terrance Stamp and Samantha Eggar ( who was nominated for an Oscar ) dominate the film , with the other parts little more than walk-ons . Stamp carries his performance a bit too far over the top at times , but Eggar is spot-on in hers . William Wyler's direction ( also nominated for an Oscar ) is mostly tight and focused , but he should haved reined Stamp in a bit more . Still a very good film . Recommended .
579711	583640	56700	8.0	Visually stunning , with George Pal's wonderful stop-motion animation , but could have used a better script and performance in the lead role .	As with almost any George Pal production , this is visually an eye-catcher and has some wonderful stop-motion animation , as you would expect from Pal . Entertaining at times , the film drags horribly in spots and could have used a better script , which is a bit surprising , as Charles Beaumont was involved . The fact that Laurence Harvey , normally excellent , seems to have phoned in his performance doesn't help matters . Still well worth watching , it just could have been much better . Recommended for the visual aspects and fairy-tale recreations .
579501	583640	63453	8.0	A very entertaining short , but one thing puzzles me-why are they moving the rock ?	This is a very good short , where the gags mostly revolve around the attempts of the Pink Panther and the little guy who regularly shows up in these shorts to move a very large rock . I have know idea why they're moving the rock . I suppose the answer to that is " Because it's there " . I want to give some details in this comment , so there are spoilers here : This short opens with the Pink Panther and the little guy moving a very large rectangular rock when the Pink Panther has the idea that it would move faster and easier if it were round . Things move quickly-until they hit an incline , when they start moving much more quickly . The little guy winds up in the valley between two slopes . The astute observer no doubt realizes just how unfortunate this position is for him . A suggestion to any future cartoon characters finding themselves in similar circumstances-try moving laterally ! Along the way , the two try using vines to pull the block along , using logs to roll a rectangular block along and putting wheels on an axle ( this last results in a very " Flintstones " type of moment in one scene , which is very funny ) . While many of the gags are predictable , the timing on the gags is good enough for most of them to still be quite amusing . The ending gag is clever and a bit of a surprise initially . A nice touch . The short comes full circle , ending as it began-with the Pink Panther and the little guy trying to move a rock . This short is on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is well worth watching , as is the collection as a whole . Recommended .
579350	583640	89643	8.0	Good movie , if you are a James Garner fan , but just average otherwise	This movie is basically a showcase for James Garner . He was nominated ( deservedly ) for an Academy Award for his performance . Sally Field does well in her role and there is a chemistry between Field and Garner on-screen . The script is good , although a sub-plot with Brian Kerwin as Field's ex doesn't really work too well , there is a decent supporting cast , but it's really Garner's movie . There is a beautiful scene where Garner gives a ride to an older gent walking down the road that you have to see and is worth the price of admission alone ! Well worth watching and recommended to anyone who likes James Garner .
579842	583640	63470	8.0	Fascinating short with excellent visual design .	This short is a very effective and funny piece of work with some fascinating bits . I will be discussing details , so this is a spoiler warning : The Pink Panther comes upon a door with an eye and enters a realm of the odd and wonderful as a result . He comes upon a character who resembles " The Little White Guy " with a beard and dressed as a beatnik . The Pink Panther pulls down a book on " fire rituals " and hands it to the beatnik , who opens it with predictable results . Not being one to hold a grudge , the guy hands our hero a book on " The Love Lives of Panthers " . Much of the rest of the cartoon revolves around the Pink Panther's attempts to read this book . He and the book fall through a hole , only to have the book " injured " severely enough to necessitate " surgery " , which is done by the beatnik , with some assistance from our pink friend . A light bulb in a lamp burns out and the PP tries without success to replace it by using a machine marked " Lights " , from which he gets almost every kind of light except a light bulb . He finally gets one by having an " idea " occur to him and taking the resulting light bulb from above his head ! Off and on , various calamities befall the beatnik , courtesy of the star of the series , until the poor guy finally loses his temper and goes after him with a most unusual weapon . The ending of the short is a bit mixed , but the final shot is quite nice . This short is on the PInk Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is most definitely worth checking out . Recommended .
579285	583640	32967	8.0	The best of a very short and not terribly effective series .	This was the best of a very short series of cartoons that was a misfired attempt playing on the Three Bears , with thoroughly unlikable characters , including Papa , a lazy , mean and obnoxious fellow , Mama , not much better than Papa and Baby , a cute cipher with no real personality to speak of and consequently most irritating . Production values are good and the story is good , with some funny moments , but MGM fared much better with the character of Barney Bear , with some endearing qualities mixed in with the gruffness . This series isn't anywhere near the same league as the considerably funnier Warner Brothers take on the same fairy tale and died quickly . This particular short has a good ending , but I've seen better ( and worse ) in my time . Average at best . Worth watching , but don't try too hard to find it unless you collect MGM cartoons . For completeists .
579709	583640	34925	8.0	Cute , well animated cartoon .	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a very cute ( almost too cute in spots ) , very well animated cartoon . Given its title , an excellent use of music is to be expected and that's precisely what you have-the animation and score going hand in glove smoothly , like a single unit , a strength of the Lantz studio in particular , although they were hardly alone . All of the major studios did the same , but Lantz and Warner Brothers were probably the best at matching music and animation rhythms . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579760	583640	32033	8.0	A very good Avery short which is now available on DV	I don't think Tex Avery directed a bad cartoon . While this one isn't one of my absolute favorites , it's still a very good cartoon ( which basically makes it a cartoon that a lot of directors would be pleased to have considered as one of their best ) . I want to discuss some of the specific details here , so here there be spoilers : The title strikes me as a play on the movie title Angels With Dirty Faces , the main caricature is one of Edward G . Robinson and the short is a very good send-up of the gangster movies that were popular in the 1930s . But it's clearly a Tex Avery short first and foremost . When a police officer is shown in silhouette appearing to strike someone and saying , " Take that you rat ! And that ! And that ! " and the picture becomes clear that he's actually throwing cheese to a rat sitting on a stool , that's an Avery moment . Then the officer says , " That's all you get-I need the rest for my lunch ! " and the rat begins to throw a tantrum and cry ! This short is full of those types of gags , from beginning to end , though they don't quite come quite as fast and furious as they would later on in his career . Call it a formative Avery-he was beginning to find his style a bit more around this time . Throughout the cartoon , he takes various conventions of film in general and the gangster genre in particular and turns them on their ear . Newspaper headlines spin in with headlines which are usually funny while ostensibly advancing the " plot " , a movie theater patron who came in in the middle of the picture tries to get up and leave , only to be ordered back to his seat by " Killer " and then informs the police what the " Killer " has planned because he's already seen the ending ! The final newspaper headline and closing gags are priceless ! This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 3 and is well worth getting . Recommended .
579573	583640	22423	8.0	Visually excellent and reminiscent of Skeleton Dance .	This is a very good cartoon in many respects , but it's virtually impossible to avoid comparing it to Skeleton Dance , which is a shame , because this cartoon is lessened in the comparison ( almost anything would be-Skeleton Dance was the first Silly Symphonies and is one of the great animated works of all time ) . Part of the problem is the " star " of the short-all too often , Flip the Frog has all the charm and personality of wet mulch . Here , he's principally a prop , a target for sight gags . The short would have been better served with no Flip , no dialog and more sight gags , but then the similarities to Skeleton Dance would be even more pronounced . Besides , Iwerks was trying to develop a recurring character , like Disney had with Mickey . Without Flip , the cartoon wouldn't exist . Still , making Flip more interesting ( as they were able to do in other shorts ) would have differentiated it from Skeleton Dance more and thus made it an even better short . Visually a treat in any case , even with Flip's blandness as the trick here . Well worth watching , glad it's in print and most recommended . Happy Hallowe'en !
579911	583640	30201	8.0	Good , but not great , short about Father Damian	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a look at the true story of a Belgian priest who went to tend to lepers in Hawaii and contracted the disease himself . At least one film has been made about Father Damien and it's a fascinating story . Thi short is good , if a bit melodramatic at times and the narration is sometimes a bit droning . Turner Classic Movies runs this between movies regularly and almost invariably runs it in March as part of their " 31 Days of Oscar " feature . Worth watching .
579944	583640	60862	8.0	Excellent action-western with a great ensemble cast	This film has a terrific script , a great cast that works well together ( particularly the four lead , Lancaster , Marvin , Ryan and the wonderful and much-underrated Woody Strode ) , excellent production values and fine direction . I don't personally care for too many action movies and can take or leave westerns , but this is a most engaging film . Most recommended .
579781	583640	150308	8.0	Quincy Magoo is at it again in this one	The title of this short is a play on the title of the feature film Destination Moon ( which itself has an animated sequence made by Walter Lantz and starring Woody Woodpecker ) and once again Magoo and his myopia take an adventure , hand in hand , off to the " Moon " . The life that man leads ! Excellent animation and great sight gags make this one worth finding . Most recommended .
579228	583640	117887	8.0	Hackneyed , cliched , trite-but somehow , it works and you can dance to itt	This movie is really , on the face of it , collection of well-worn characters , plot devices and cliched , old scenarios and it should really just sink to the bottom with only a gurgling sound or two . But , amazingly enough , it works just well enough to be worth watching . Most of the performances are at least good and some are very good . Liv Tyler does the best of the principal cast , but three of the supporting roles give it life and one of them all but steals the movie . Bill Cobb as a jazz musician and Rita Wilson ( Tom Hanks ' wife in real life ) as a waitress have very good parts and shine in their scenes . But Obba Babatunde as Lamarr , the hotel doorman is great and all but walks off with the movie . The music is very good all through the movie , with the title track getting an Oscar nomination . It's played throughout the movie and is infectious . It's got a beat and you can dance to it . I give it a 77 .
579018	583640	43073	8.0	Not the best Mr . Magoo , but entetaining anyway	This cartoon , nominated for an Oscar , is reasonably good , but not one of the better of the series . Well worth watching , the series is more noted these days for the furor generated by people who consider it an insult to the blind and those whose sight is impaired . I'm disabled and it is my considered opinion that 1 ) way too many people are too thin-skinned 2 ) far too many people are entirely too concerned about either hurting someone's feelings or having their own feelings hurt and 3 ) anyone who feels offended by a CARTOON neds to get a life . End of sermon . The Mr . Magoo series is essentially a one-note affair that at its best is marvelously funny and is usually at least well worth watching . Trouble Indemnity has its moments and is a fairly good short on its own merits .
578805	583640	28100	8.0	Entertaining short from the 1930s with some very nice animation	This is a short starring some lesser-known characters , namely Beans and the duo of Ham and Ex . It's a mostly effective , though somewhat uneven , black and white cartoon directed by Jack King . As I want to discuss the short , there will be spoilers : The short starts off with Ham and Ex reading that their " Uncle " Beans is going exploring for " Haunted Treasure " , so they stow away on his plane and off they go . Beans spots a wreck and lands , to see a spooky bat fly off the side of the Phantom Ship . Naturally , Ham and EX jump out to surprise him just then , which scares him . They go on the ship and Ham and Ex see skeletons , get under a sheet and scare skeletons themselves . I would have liked it had this sub-plot continued , but the short diverges , with Beans finding two frozen pirates near a stove and , inexplicably , starts a fire in the stove . Following a train of thought to its practical and logical conclusion is clearly not his long suit . He finds the treasure and starts loading it on his plane , while the pirates thaw out and take a dim view of theft when they are the victims rather than the perpetrators . The chase being on , one pirate goes after Beans and the other goes after Ham and Ex . After some nice sequences in the chase scenes , Ham and Ex jump in the plane and take off , while Beans gets blown up with the ship , goes skyward and is caught in mid-air by Ham and Ex in the plane and our heroes exit , stage left . Very good early short from Warner Brothers . Well worth watching if you get the opportunity . Recommended .
578876	583640	31552	8.0	A double parody-sending up both newsreels and travelogues in one short	Tex Avery did quite a few shorts lampooning the travelogue shorts that were prevalent in the 1930s and one or two satires on the newsreels pre-television visual accounts of news of the week / month . Here he does a short presented in the form of a newsreel that pokes fun at travelogues . Very nice figureskating sequence using rotoscoping - the shooting of live-action footage that is later animated-that is one of the better bits . Good short , but Avery did better in the same vein . Still worth seeking out ( I personally think that even Avery's less successful shorts are better or as good as some other directors best work ! ) . Recommended .
579924	583640	55298	8.0	An Oscar nominee , it has a few moments	This cartoon actually has more energy before its ' main premise begins . The idea of playing " The Mexican Hat Dance " on a flute to mezmerize mice is marginally funny , but the chemistry really isn't there with Sylvester and Speedy like it is with Sylvester and Tweety and the chase scenes aren't really that novel . It has enough moments in it that are enjoyable enough to make it worth watching ( even good enough to recommend , if you like Speedy ) , but the cartoon isn't that special in it's own right . It's not too easy to find , but it has been on VHS in the past . Recommended , particularly if you like Speedy .
578996	583640	44844	8.0	This proves that sometimes it's better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission	This is a very good short directed by the forgotten director , Dick Lundy . Most people remember Hanna and Barbera and Tex Avery . But very few remember Lundy , who chiefly directed Barney Bear cartoons in the early 1950s . Lundy wasn't the greatest director MGM had , but he did some very good work . In this cartoon , the focus is on an extremely annoying little duck . Visions of an orange glaze come to mind whenever I see this cartoon . I don't generally go for hunting as a rule , but I'd make an exception here . I'd shoot first and worry about breaking rules and paying fines later ! Well worth watching . Recommended .
579103	583640	148543	8.0	Flip watches over a baby-oh , the humanity !	This is actually a fairly good short . Warning : I more or less have to discuss some parts of this in order to comment in a comprehendable manner , so consider this your spoiler warning . Flip is having a really bad day . Said bad day leads our hero to take on the job of watching a baby for a whole quarter ! Flip's misfortunes continue and the cartoon revolves around his attempts to retrieve his fee . He really needs that quarter badly , to judge by what he puts himself through to get it back . I don't think I'd go through what he does for a quarter ! Great sight gags abound and Flip actually has something of a personality in this one . He evokes sympathy at points here . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579675	583640	79354	8.0	Entertaining short about an unusual household	This short , a nominee for the Academy Award , was adapted from a story by Harry Allard , a children's author . Meant primarily for children , like all good animation , it can be viewed with enjoyment by adults as well . The title tells the basic story and this cute and charming short is well worth seeking out . Recommended .
579008	583640	44865	8.0	Good cartoon based on the series of children's boks that have become popular again recently	This short from the UPA studio was nominated for an Oscar . Based on the Madeline series of childrens books that recently received a boost and have led to a feature-length live action movie as well as an animated series , UPA did this short back in the 1950s and it captures the books ' flavor very well . This short can be found on one of the Columbia Classics series of tapes released some years ago and is well worth watching .
579597	583640	40415	8.0	Funny , but an odd cartoon , even for a Tex Avery	This short is quite funny , but it's an odd one , even for Avery . Part of a series of shorts featuring two characters called George and Junior , most of this centers around the activity of a very small pygmy , somewhat reminiscent of Inki from the Warner Brothers shorts . Unlikely to be in general release due to caricatures , it is worth hunting down nonetheless . Recommended .
579143	583640	58036	8.0	Bugs Meets Taz , Take Four	This is the fourth and last Bugs versus Taz done in the 1960s and is almost as good as the first one was . Although most of the gags are visual ( including the closing one , a very good one indeed ) , there are verbal jokes as well and the dialogue is good . They made relatively few of these , I suspect because Taz's motivation was limited and therefore there wasn't anything they could do here that wasn't being done ( to better effect ) with the Wile E . Coyote and the Road-Runner series of cartoons . This one's very good and the ending is very funny ( unless you're Bugs Bunny ) . Recomended .
578911	583640	27453	8.0	Actually , for the Fleischers , this is a comparatively " normal " cartoon .	The Cobweb Hotel is a cute , somewhat dated , cartoon with some very good moments . Strange thing is , I keep reading and hearing comments from other people that range from " scary " to " weird and strange " , which tells me people haven't seen a whole lot of the output of Fleischer Studios ! Though the Fleischers did do some more sedate work than this one , compared to some of the earlier shorts , this one is downright " normal " ( whatever that is , anyway ) . Part of the Color Classics series ( where Max Fleischer tries to out-Walt Disney , instead of being Max hisownself ) , this is on the DVD release Somewhere In Dreamland , which is an excellent purchase . Try and chase down a copy , if you can . Well worth the effort . Recommended .
579909	583640	22669	8.0	Just plain bizarre !	This is the strangest Betty Boop I have ever seen in my life ! Bit and pieces make a strange kind of sense here and there , but it has to be easily the oddest Betty Boop made . Hard to describe , as it must be seen if it's to make even marginal sense at all . The ending is obvious to me-at least I think it is . I can't be at all certain . If you like Betty , then you'll probably like this one . Worth watching . Recommended to fans of Betty Boop .
579236	583640	109629	8.0	This is sick , twisted and depraved-in other words , very funny !	This short , brought to you by the man who developed Courage the Cowardly Dog , no less , is like what I would expect a collaboration between Tex Avery and R . Crumb to look like , if they were both doing copious amounts of caffinated beverages , that is ! It's even lewder than Avery and moves about as fast ( nobody does Avery as fast-or as funny-as the man himself , though countless animators have tried . This is perfect for Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted , but I got it on the generally tamer Festival of Animation , Vol 3 . It's an excellent tape , well worth getting . As for Dirdy Birdy , if you are easily offended , you may want to pass on this short , because your head might explode ! Recommended to anyone who likes Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted . Anyone else , it may be too much for you to handle !
578951	583640	49258	8.0	Amusing sequel to the incredible Gerald McBoing-Boing	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a decent effort , quite amusing at times , but in comparison to the first short in the series , it suffers somewhat . Entertaining and quite creative in and of itself and well worth watching , but not a terribly special animated short by comparison to the other ground-breaking work that UPA turned out through the years . Recommended .
579183	583640	116999	8.0	This family put the " dys " into " dysfunctional " .	This is really the little movie that could . It is a very good film that likely got made only because Robert DeNiro co-produced it and thus had the clout to raise financing . With a script at different turns funny and wrenching and an exceptional cast that by and large does a great job playing a family that occasionally makes the Addams family look mundane , particularly Diane Keaton and Leonardo DiCaprio . Am I the only one who's noticed that DiCaprio does his best performances in little films ( read : small-budget ) that make up for limitations by , wonder of wonders , good scripts and perhaps more challenging roles . He can act ; all too often he doesn't seem to want to from his selection of parts . Yes , I am talking about Titanic . Good movie , even if it isn't going to save the ozone layer or bring about world peace . It is an entertaining way to pass not quite two hours and it does have Hume Cronyn , whom I'd gladly have watched reading a newspaper and drinking coffee , he was so good . Well worth seeing . Recommended .
579326	583640	41858	9.0	Very good Droopy cartoon	This short is a very good Tex Avery Droopy . Droopy is the cartoon " Everyman " who somehow manages to come out on top whatever the odds are or the forces arrayed against him . Tex Avery's principal continuing character while at MGM , I wouldn't be at all surprised if Droopy was the character appearing in the most Tex Avery shorts of any continuing character Avery ever worked with . Given the characters he worked with at Warner Brothers , that's saying something ! Good to see that it's in print . Well worth seeing . Recommended , particularly for Lina Romay sigh
579232	583640	262421	9.0	Tim Burton , eat your heart out !	On the whole , I actually think that Tim Burton would find this one amusing if it ever crossed his field of vision . I think James Whale would probably have loved it too . Not your typical Christmas cartoon , by any means . Sentimentalist that I am , I like to think that when Frannie grew up , she got an appropriate job , like working for an HMO or something like that . Macabre little short with a heart ( pulsing madly in a jar , no doubt ) of at least bronze , if not gold . It's on Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation , Vol 3 , I think . Well worth watching , this one gets an " A " for sheer chutzpah alone . Recommended .
579316	583640	37569	9.0	Until fairly recently , Goofy has been all too overlooked .	Walt Disney and his animation staff gave the world a great many fascinating , entertaining and memorable characters over the years , but one of the best has also , paradoxically , been largely given short shrift by far too many people-Goofy , who was and is , in many ways , far more interesting than Donald Duck ever was or could be and even gives Mickey a run for his money at times . Where Mickey and Donald needed foils to work exceptionally well , Goofy works quite well simply placed in a situation and having jokes bounce off him ( sometimes quite literally ) without needing a Pluto or a Chip n ' Dale around to provide a source for tension and / or interaction . Besides , in a pinch , every character in a cartoon could resemble Goofy ( like this one , for instance ) if need be . This is a marvelous short from the mid-1940s that holds up very well indeed . Typically superb animation ( a Disney hallmark throughout their history , as a general rule ) and hilarious premise and narration . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579437	583640	41380	9.0	Pepe Le Pew's only Oscar bid was a winner !	This cartoon won an Oscar for Pepe Le Pew almost ten years before Bugs Bunny won for Knighty Knight Bugs . Pepe is one of my favorite characters and this is one of the better cartoons in the series , although not my personal favorite ( that's Touche and Go ) . Pepe discovers wht it's like to have the shoe on the other foot in this one . Great fun in this one . It should be in-print . It has been in the past , most notably on the tape A Salute to Chuck Jones from the Golden Jubilee series . Cartoon Network shows it fairly often . Recommended .
578830	583640	94047	9.0	Would never be confused with Barney !	This short is beautifully realized , with excellent animation and good production values . Sort of a fairy tale , but not a traditional one . Sort of Gary Larson meets the Brothers Grimm . I thought it was marvelous ! Well worth the trouble to track down . Recommended .
579134	583640	34127	9.0	The best of the Barney Bear cartoons-it's hilarious !	The Barney Bear cartoons were more silly than funny for the most part . The most interesting thing about them is the fact that the character was purportedly inspired by actor Wallace Beery , a big star in the 1930s and early 1940s . You can see similarities between the two . This is the best of the series and is wonderfully done . It was deservedly nominated for a Oscar for Animated Short . Poor Barney goes through a basic training concocted by de Sade ! Probably not that far from real basic training at that ! Highly recommended .
579337	583640	44840	9.0	The tale of the biter bit .	The whole premise of the Pepe Le Pew cartoons is based on a whopping bit of irony-a French skunk styling himself as " the great lover " ( think Charles Boyer squared ) but , for reasons obvious to everyone save himself , he finds it difficult to get a date on Saturday nights . Like a great many would-be Lotharios , when the tables turn , Pepe turns chicken and runs . A very funny cartoon , with a joke that will be particularly enjoyable for horse racing fans , at least older ones anyway . One party-pooper note : by law ( unless it's been changed ) French nationals cannot join the French Foreign Legion , which , given the name , should be stunningly obvious . Well worth tracking down . Recommended .
579910	583640	22604	9.0	Koko and Bimbo just can't win here at all !	This short had to be done pre-code , because it wouldn't have been worth doing if you have to change much to make it " decent " . Koko and Bimbo both try to impress Betty , but they make an unfortunate error and try to give her what she says she wants-a dangerous move to make with most women . This is the place where a comment about fickleness in general and Betty Boop in particular , would belong , but visions of irate women armed with torches and pitchforks descending on my residence like extras in Frankenstein give me pause and , as with all noble cowards , discretion is my chosen course , so instead , I'll make an observation about people in general saying one thing but changing their minds about it later . Koko and Bimbo are in for something of a surprise in the end here . The moral here , kiddies . is to always have a backup plan for when things ( almost inevitably ) go differently than you planned . In print and available . Well worth watching . Recommended .
579917	583640	80928	9.0	Very good movie with some excellent performances and good scriptwriting ( great ending ! )	Let me start out first with a bit of a disclaimer : I am disabled , so I was either going to love this movie or hate it , depending on how real things seemed to me . So my comments have to be seen in that light . Here goes : This is a very good film , with a good cast , some excellent performances and I love the script . But the thing that impresses me the most about this film is its portrayal of the disabled . They come across as average , normal people-sometimes they're jerks , like most people and sometimes they're nice folks , like most people . There is nothing inherently heroic about being disabled . Conversely , the disabled should not be hermetically sealed off from society for their protection ( or yours ) . All too often , peole make assumptions about people and far too many are made about the disabled . End of sermon . The other thing I like about this film , although it is admittedly a bit too pat , is the ending of a couple of plot threads . Suffice it to say that Several of the characters get what they deserve , good and bad . I love the poetic justice ( or karma , if you prefer ) at the end , in the basketball arena . Most recommended .
579492	583640	187859	9.0	Well-done , fascinating documentary about following your heart and a dream .	This documentary follows Paul Pena , a blind blues musician ( and the songwriter behind Jet Airliner , a hit for the Steve Miller Band ) and a group of friends to a place called Tuva for a competition in " throatsinging " , which Pena had come across and decided to learn . The documentary is a fascinating look at Tuva ( part of Mongolia now under Russian control ) , " throatsinging " ( an acquired taste , but worth hearing at least once ) and Paul Pena's adventures on the trip as well as his feelings about the whole thing . Most recommended .
578818	583640	104361	9.0	Great short with interesting concepts	This short was nominated for the Academy Award . It introduces us to Wallace and Gromit . Interestingly , the stars are less appealing than one of the supporting characters : the little whatever-it-is they run into on their jaunt to the moon for cheese . This little critter apparently wants to be Jean-Claude Killy when it grows up . The best parts of a very fine short are with this odd little entity , whatever it happens to be . Fine beginning to a great series that's gotten better as it goes along . Recommended to those few souls who haven't seen it yet .
579164	583640	151970	10.0	Great mix of Jazz and animation in a re-telling of the Pied Piper fairy tale .	Walter Lantz used jazz music to score quite a few cartoons because the head of his music department liked jazz and knew some musicians personally . Jack Teagarden was one of the musicians who appeared on the soundtracks to at least two of the better musical shorts , the magnificent Sliphorn King of Polaroo and this one , that's almost as good . Here the Pied Piper plays swing on a trombone to rid the town of rats and the mayor sounds like Lou Costello . Wonderful cartoon that should be available . Well worth tracking down and getting . Most highly recommended .
579075	583640	85548	10.0	Yet another triumph from the National Film Board of Canada	This documentary , which won an Oscar for Documentary Short , shows a dance class in session with the students being shown how to dance flamenco . Interspersed between shots of the students practising steps and dancing , the instructors are interviewed . It's a fascinating view of a beautiful style of dance as well as proof that some people are most fortunate to be able to do something they love for a living . The National Film Board of Canada was involved in overseeing this production and has consistently produced excellent work for more than sixty years .
579271	583640	43857	10.0	Greater damage is done trying to do good in life ( and cartoons ) !	I believe it was Thoreau who said , " If I knew that a man were coming to my home with the fixed intention of doing me good , I would flee for my very life . " Tom develops amnesia and Jerry and Mammy try to " help " him recover his memory . While Jerry's efforts are not entirely altruistic ( Tom's rather irritating behaving like a rather large mouse ) Tom is better off as a cat . But the best laid plans of mice and men don't go very well here , with painfully obvious and hilarious results . Lots of great sight gags and semi-vocal effects for Tom . Well worth looking for and most recommended .
578796	583640	41592	10.0	One of the first appearances of the little mouse , called Nibbles here	This cartoon , an Oscar winner ( with good reason , as it's marvelous ) features one of the early appearances of the little mouse named Nibbles primarily ( although sometimes called Tuffy ) , he is rather cute and endearing . But I'd hate to pay his grocery bills ! Nibbles became a very frequent and popular character and this was his second cartoon appearance , after The Milky Waif . Most highly recommended .
579811	583640	28467	10.0	This is not your grandfather's Longfellow	Take one poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , add Porky Pig and put them in the Tex Avery blender , set on " maniac " and this cartoon is what resulted . Tex Avery style of gags abound . Pay attention to backgrounds and the extras . Some very good stuff to be seen here . Well worth your time .
579004	583640	54698	10.0	What some think of as Audrey Hepburn's best film , it is certainly her signature role	Many think that this is Audrey Hepburn's best film ( I think it was Charade ) or that this is her best performance ( I think that was in Wait Until Dark ) . What this was for Hepburn is the most single memorable role of her career-her signature role . I cannot picture anyone else as Holly Golightly , no matter how hard I try . She made better films ( Charade and My Fair Lady , among others ) and did better work ( The Children's Hour and Wait Until Dark , among others ) but this is the part most people associate with Audrey Hepburn in their minds first . ery good film , with a memorable score and an excellent cast , although Mickey Rooney chews the scenery a bit TOO hard here . Most recommended .
579658	583640	72431	10.0	An incredibly funny and affectionate send-up of the horror film in general and Frankenstein films in particular	There really isn't much I can say that doubtless someone else hasn't said . Brooks used the same location and sets that were used for the lab scenes in the original 1931 James Whale version . Anyone who doesn't laugh at either the scene with Gene Hackman as a blind hermit or the scene where Marty Feldman and Gene Wilder are discussing the brain that Feldman brought for transplant has absolutely no pulse whatsoever . Gloriously funny from start to finish . Kenneth Mars is a hoot and Liam Dunn is a scream in one of the most painful-looking funny scenes in cinematic history ! Most Highly Recommended .
578776	583640	37251	10.0	One of Tex Avery's attempts at developing a continuing character .	Tex Avery preferred doing one-shot cartoons as opposed to using a regular character or characters . He was more interested in the gags than anything else . Studios , of course , want something recognizable to the audience , to developing continuing interest and thus sell more tickets . So Avery , because MGM wanted him to come up with a character to rival the Tom and Jerry shorts done by the other principle unit at the studio ( Hanna and Barbera ) came up with Screwball Squirrel . While Screwy was a decent enough character , the trouble was that he was too limited , too much a one-note character . He was a walking sight gag . There were five cartoons done with Screwy before the series ended , in typical Avery style , with Lonesome Lenny . The Screwy cartoons are funny , but also too predictable . The first one , here , opens wonderfully with a lighthearted ( or maybe not ) shot at cutesy little animal cartoons that were staples at " other studios " for years and takes off from there . This is probably the best of the series . Well worth watching . Most highly recommended .
579941	583640	50194	10.0	An Oscar winner and one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons	This is a delightful cartoon and one of the most effective and entertaining Sylvester and Tweety cartoons Warner Brothers did . The B . A . meeting is inspired parody and Sylvester's attempts to kick the " bird habit " are exceptionally funny . Tweety's closing line is the perfect capper to a wonderful ending . Won a well-earned Oscar . Shows frequently on Cartoon Network . Highly recommended .
579636	583640	53064	10.0	The best of the Speedy Gonzales shorts	This cartoon , nominated for an Oscar , is the best of the Spedy Gonzales cartoon shorts that were made in the Golden Age of Warner Brothers . I saw this cartoon again recently and found it was much better than I originally thought it was years ago . The highlight of the cartoon for me has to be the appearance of " Slowpoke " Rodriguez , one of Speedy's cousins . Hilarious ! Cartoon Network may or may not air this one . A bit difficult to find but well worth the effort . Recommended .
579540	583640	35794	10.0	This is a remarkable piece of work !	This short won an Academy Award and should have ! An exceptionally tough cartoon to see , as it's most difficult to find . Disney , with some understandable reluctance , has not made this available . While understandable , I don't agree with the choice they've made here . This cartoon should be seen , it should be widely available and is a big part of the Golden Age of Disney . Qute probably the best theatrical short Disney ever made ( certainly the best that I've seen ) and it's unfortunate that DIsney has clearly consigned it to the vaults . I fervently hope they change their minds . My highest recommendation here . Worth the trouble to locate and should be in print ! ! !
579073	583640	27785	10.0	An exceptionally cute and very well done cartoon from the master	This is an early cartoon done by Tex Avery when he was still being screen-credited as Fred . I haven't seen it in years but recall it vividly . Little son scarecrow wants to follow in dad's footsteps ( or should that be strawsteps ? ) but dad suggests he wait a bit until he's older . Son decides to give it a go anyway , with predictable results . The expressiveness of the various characters is quite remarkable and I've seen film footage of Avery and another resident ( or maybe inmate is more accurate ) acting out one scene , which is probably why the movements seem so realistic . It's an entertaining and effective piece of animation . A good time was had by all . Most recommended
578944	583640	118147	10.0	Absolutely riveting study of two champions and I don't even LIKE boxing ! !	I watched this because a good friend insisted I do so , though I see nothing terribly fascinating or interesting in boxing . What I saw was a case study in two very different men who made a living beating each other up , as well as anyone else unwise to step into the ring with either of them . I still don't think much of boxing , but I respect Ali and Foreman more now and think that at least some boxers are athletes and not bashers . Recommended .
579299	583640	58528	10.0	One of my favorite Speedy Gonzales shorts !	This is the best Speedy that doesn't have Slowpoke Rodriguez . I love this cartoon ! Sylvester is a great foil for Speedy , Malcolm the Falcon is hilarious and the ending to the cartoon is perfect . Just an all-around great short . Well worth trying to see . Most highly recommended !
579611	583640	31749	10.0	This civics lesson brought to you by Warner Brothes and Porky Pig	With the amount of attention being currently given to the Pledge of Allegiance and when ( or even whether ) it should be said , this cartoon sets forth a very direct and basic value to those words that still holds over 60 years later . Allegiance should ( actually I feel that it MUST ) be given freely and by choice or its valueless . This cartoon , through effective use of rotoscoping ( at least it looks like rotoscoping ) , is an enlightening look into the value of patriotism and makes some compelling arguments in its favor . Recommended .
578793	583640	26086	10.0	One of the best shorts " done by a Smith named Pete "	Pete Smith was a master of the short films once known as " one-reel " and " two-reel " subjects . Although the bulk of his wrk was humorous in subject and / or tone , he did do more serious work . His best work was very funny , although some of the humor is dated . This is one of the best shorts he did . These were referred to as " A Pete Smith Specialty " and on the title card , it said that this " was done by a Smith named Pete " . The visuals are still quite effective 65 + years later . Turner Classic Movies runs this and a great many other " Pete Smith Specialty " shorts in between movies . This one is highly recommended .
579953	583640	28057	10.0	This should have won the Oscar in 1936 !	This is te cartoon that should have won instead of Country Cousin . Visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable . Worth watching just for the music alone ! Although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days , the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective . It's over sixty years old and it is , after all , just a cartoon . I'm disabled and if I were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage , I would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away . Sometimes you need to lighten up , put your head back and float ! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering . Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion . SIGH
579898	583640	95801	10.0	Starts very slowly and finished very strongly , so give it a chance .	I watched this because it had been recommended by a friend . After 15-20 minutes I almost quit , but I decided to stick it out another ten minutes , which was an excellent idea . The two leads turn in marvelous performances and Jack Palance does an even better turn here than he did in City Slickers . The last thirty minutes ( of the US version ) is wonderful . So stick with it , even though it's slow going to start with . You will be amply rewarded for your patience . Quirky little film . Most recommended .
579682	583640	87040	10.0	Excellent short with the oddest game of Charades I've ever seen	This short won the Academy Award for Animated Short in 1984 . While this is an excellent short , it would not have been my choice that year , as good as it is . But this is a wonderfully humorous and maddening short . One of the Charades players is particularly obtuse ! The animation and dialogue are superb and it is certainly good that it is available on World's Greatest Animation ( an excellent VHS / DVD compiation that I recommend highly ) and is most highly recommended .
578950	583640	102392	10.0	Excellent example of animation	This short won the Academy Award and faced some stiff competition from two shorts produced by the National Film Board of Canada . Any of the three could have won , but it's easy to see why Manipulation did . It's a simply drawn short , but the animation is incredible ! The interaction here is great and is also very funny and fun to watch . This was on Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation Volume 2 and is well worth hunting for . Most Highly Recommended .
579780	583640	36334	10.0	Daffy protects his scrap pile , with a bit of encouragement	This cartoon , appropriately and effectively in black and white , is a World War II patriotic short , with Daffy needing to protect his scrap pile ( for the war effort ) from a very hungry Nazi goat . The pep rally conducted by Daffy's ancestors is a highlight of the short and the ending is marvelous . Well worth the time and effort to find . Most highly recommended .
578779	583640	152989	10.0	The last theatrically produced Magoo and it's a fitting conclusion for UPA !	This short is the last one produced for movie theater release , both in the Magoo series as well as the last made by the studio . Magoo goes out in perfect form and style . The plot revolves around a television program and a most unusual burglary . The standard Magoo sight gags and a most entertaining finale to the run . Well worth tracking down and getting . Most highly recommended .
579520	583640	58211	10.0	By following these safe ( well , maybe not safe ) and easy guidelines , you , too can avoid friendship !	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is one of four in a series of " self-help " cartoons done by Rembrandt Films . Arthur Treacher narrates all four and is perfect for the job ! I suspect it's safe to say that if the advice here is followed , friendship is not something that will trouble you for terribly long ! This short , along with the others in the series , can be found on Rembrandt Films Greatest Hits and the entire compilation is wholeheartedly recomended .
579768	583640	351167	10.0	Visually a treat , extraordinary CGI !	While having just the barest of a discernable storyline and no plot to speak of ( at least not one that I could find ) , this matters not a whit in my eyes . This is a treat for the eyes , first and foremost , an absolutely breathtaking piece of work . This blows the " crowd " scenes in Gladiator away , though that is admittedly not a difficult feat to manage . I suspect that Gladiator had a larger budget for SFX alone than was spent on Katedra in its entirety and the lead in Katedra is likely more amiable and personable ( if just as laconic ) than the chap in Gladiator . Quite impressive , even if work done three or four years from now makes this look like a Model T compared to a Rolls . Nominated for an Academy Award and deservingly so . Most highly recommended .
578810	583640	106446	10.0	Quite possibly the most unfortunately-timed mid-life crisis ever !	This short justly won the Academy Award and is probably one of the two short produced by the National Film Board of Canada ( the other is The Cat Came Back ) that most people would have seen than any other work done under their umbrella . Excellent and hilariously funny , particularly Bob's semi-meltdown under circumstances that his wife Margaret would just as soon forget . Beware of surprises . Available from the NFBC , relatively easily for Canadian citizens , a bit more complex for non-Canadians , but worth it either way . Most joyously recommended by a somewhat less neurotic , just-turned-42 Robert !
579005	583640	236447	10.0	Excellent documentary that is engaging and thought-provoking-Warning Potential SPOILER comments	This is an exceptionally well-done and thoughtful documentary on the aftermath of apartheid in South Africa and the rather different " war crimes " tribunel approach they took in South Africa . While I was disappointed that they didn't touch on black-on-black attacks ( anyone who's ever seen the end result of " the necklace " - even on film-won't ever forget ) , it was a very good and even-handed presentation . I could not write a comment here without getting this off my chest , though : POSSIBLE SPOILER - In my opinion , there isn't any difference materially between Eric Taylor-white SA police officer who killed a black SA man unlawfully-and Robert McBride-black SA who admits to planting a bomb outside a club that killed three women . That they are treated quite differently by the tribunal in their respective amnesty applications is therefore disturbing , although the reasons are obvious and I do not think the tribunal played favorites in any way . Most Recommended .
579717	583640	94364	10.0	A remarkable piece of animation by Bill Plympton	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is visually exceptional and conceptually wonderful . From what I've seen of his work , it's also one of the most conventionally " normal " pieces he's done ! It's a kick to watch . Plympton is an acquired taste and I seem to have done so . If you like good animation that messes with the boundaries and sometimes colors outside the lines , try Plympton . By all means , catch this one ! Most recommended .
579791	583640	22758	10.0	The most unusual chess match since Through the Looking Glass	This short is one of the most eccentric cartoons the Fleischer Brothers ever did ! It opens with two men at a chess board , apparently playing a match and then turns its focus onto the pieces for the most bizarre game of chess played since Lewis Carroll penned Through the Looking Glass ! Very odd , even for a Betty Boop in the early 1930s . Wonderful short . I sincerely doubt , however , that another commenter was talking about this short , from the gist of his or her comments . In print and available . Well worth watching . Highly recommended .
579083	583640	52139	10.0	One of the best pairings of Daffy and Porky and absolutely hilarious !	This short is an extremely funny teaming of Daffy with Porky as his " straight man " ( with Porky's antics the cause of a lot of the funniest bits ) . I have to talk about something specific in the short , so let this be my spoiler warning : Any cartoon where Porky Pig sings the first verse of " Barbara Allen " is one my permanent list of favorites . When I first saw this cartoon , hearing an old tradition song issuing forth in the dulcet tones of Porky Pigs had me rolling on the floor and it still makes me laugh like a loon to this day . The fun in this cartoon is watching Daffy and his progressively desperate ( and increasingly unsuccessful ) attempts to convince Porky that he really is Robin Hood , honest and for truly , he is ! This has been released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection on DVD and it ( and the rest of the Collections ) are well worth having and all most highly recommended !
579726	583640	153448	10.0	Why wasn't this nominated for an Academy Award ?	The failure of AMPAS to nominate this cartoon for an Oscar is unbelievable ! Granted , it was a good year for animated shorts and a good year particularly for UPA-Columbia , but this cartoon is simply delightful ! Written by James Thurber and animated in Thurber's artistic style , it is his world come to life ! If you like James Thurber , you'll love this cartoon , probably as much as I do ! Highly recommended . Edit : Since I posted this particular comment , I discovered just why it wasn't nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Subject-it was never submitted to AMPAS for consideration , because Stephen Bosustow was , for some reason , not pleased with the end results . I think that it's a marvelous piece of work , but without submission for consideration , the Academy could not nominate the short . I've since watched it several times and it is still highly recommended .
