517448	1132073	120753	1.0	The Million Dollar Waste !	Why in the whole world was this movie made ? How could it of been released with such a story and who would want to make a film with such a story and its sub-angles ? Even more questionable is why in the world did Mel Gibson even think if he'd want to be in this film ? Beats Me ! This movie is so incredibly stupid its even worse than a than asking a very grouchy person a question a hundred times in row ! Gibson's great talent is so misused here . I am surprised that this didn't hurt Milla Jovovich's career . Tim Roth is totally wasted in this film . And what in the world was with Jimmy Smits ' character ? His character was so unnecessary . I won't even go about Bono ! Many films that are good are on the IMDb Bottom 100 list . Why isn't this ? This needs to replace one and quickly too ! I don't recommend this film to anyone unless they want to see great actors being total jokes in a sucky film .
517028	1132073	104240	2.0	A very disappointing movie indeed : (	With Jeff Goldblum being the star I thought this was going to be a dark murder mystery but I was very disappointed with this movie . I don't know if the movie tried to be a moral movie about don't do drugs , talk to your parents if you have something bad on your mind , or a murder mystery ? Why was other top notch actors such as Samuel L . Jackson , John C . McGinley , and Famke Janssen used in the film ? McGinley was uncredited and I don't know why ? What was really the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette as the psychic ? All four had such short roles in the film . Through out the beginning is all there was the big talk about the chew and didn't find out what the chew is until the middle . I really don't know what I watched . Jeff Goldblum performed very well . If you must watch this movie prepare for a hundred minute boring fest ! If you are not sure about renting the film or not don't let the box fool you ! Avoid it no matter what you do ! Though if you want to see another Goldblum movie however watch the superior Mister Frost !
517837	1132073	254871	5.0	Wishmaster 3 !	The Wishmaster series is a very different series . In this Wishmaster Andrew Divoff is gone as the the Djinn though the new plays the character well . The film in My opinion isn't as good as the first one but it is gory but its a film for horror fans ! . If you like Michael Myers , Freddy , and Jason , then you'll love the Djinn , the Wishmaster !
517299	1132073	92115	5.0	A disappointing horror film : (	Troll was really a good project that in My opinion was handled poorly . The cast was really good but they did their best . Poor Noah Hathaway , the great young actor of The Neverending Story had to be a part of this . Michael Moriarty's character was a joke and his character's wife no only looked liked but wanted to be Kay Lenz . Why in the world was Sonny Bono in this ? Poor little Phil Fondacaro . You get so attached to his character and then that stupid thing happens to him . Julia Louis-Dreyfus ' character was had potential but when she danced and teased the viewer that was enough and what was with not using June Lockhart as the one to stop the troll but then her character is played by her real life daughter and then she suddenly gets defeated ? The Troll looked very good though . I hate to bash any film but I just ain't satisfied with this one though most horror fans will !
516902	1132073	134983	5.0	Disappointing film : (	The movie is ok , it has good acting and effect but that's just about it . I was disappointed about the end . Sci-Fi fans may want to check this out and James Spader is good in it and if you are fan of his you'll like him in it but I think you'll be disappointed like I was . It was just a ok film , that's all .
517306	1132073	122961	5.0	An ok sequel .	The Arrival II in My honest opinion is just a ok sequel . I was much more pleased with the original as it didn't have any sex or any think like that plus it showed the great looking aliens a lot more and views of the sky . Don't get Me wrong here the movie is not boring or dull its just that I think that the original one is the better of the two but if you like the Arrival and haven't seen the sequel then check it out and see what you think !
517838	1132073	73260	5.0	A disappointing dinosaur film : (	This film was really good until they discovered the land that time forgot . I mean it just seemed like the film focused on who is in control of the sub and killing all the dinosaurs that the could and pushing around the poor caveman . I really dislike it when films have dinosaurs and people kill them . If you are like Me and don't like to see dinosaurs getting killed then just watch the Jurassic Park Trilogy ! You'll be safe there with great entertainment !
516888	1132073	71138	5.0	Buy Blind Fury instead !	Cold Blood is a fair film that has a great cast including Rutger Hauer , Vera Tschechowa , Horst Frank Walter Richter , GÃ¼nther Stoll , Walter Sedlmayr , Andreas Mannkopff , Anna-Maria Asmus , and Erich Kleiber . The acting by all of these actors is OK . The movie didn't get a high rating from Me here because of the lack greatness and the for the several nudity scenes from the woman . It seems like she will freely show her body on film even in the sex scene . This all brought it downhill for Me . I mean it did have a good villain and some good action but I would not recommend this film even to the hardcore fan of Haurer to watch this movie . One movie I do strongly recommend is Blind Fury ! Now that was a great Rugter Hauer movie . Nevermind this film and buy Blind Fury instead !
517371	1132073	236013	5.0	Guilty as Charged !	Guilty as Charged is a fair film that has a good cast which includes Antonio Sabato Jr . , James Remar , Duane Davis , Yuji Okumoto , Melissa Lewis , Elijah Mahar , Emilio Rivera , Johnny Urbon , William Jones , Deron McBee , Randy Mulkey , Gary Cervantes , Robert Crow , Bob Rudd , and Dean Hayman Mason . The acting by all of these actors is very good . The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good . The only downfall is the sex and nudity scene which I thought brought the excitement of the film down a few stars but however , the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like Antonio Sabato Jr . , James Remar , Duane Davis , Yuji Okumoto , Melissa Lewis , Elijah Mahar , the rest of the cast in the film , Action , Thrillers , Crime , Dramas , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
517349	1132073	327137	6.0	Secondhand Lions !	Secondhand Lions is a family type film that stars Michael Caine and Robert Duvall ! Their acting was good especially by Duvall but I think their roles didn't allow them to do much . It just seemed like they were there only to say a few words and that was it . I think when Caine's character was telling the story and you saw all of those action scenes didn't fit in . Hey I love action in movies but in this film's case I think the movie would have been much better if those scenes were not in it . Also like the two main stars the rest of the cast could only do what they given . To be honest the best part in the film is whenever the animals are screen . The music was fine . Now on to the subject of recommending this film . I don't recommend it for fans who want to see an action film unless you want to see some action that doesn't fit in the film . However I do recommended it if you want to see a family film with some cute animals , some action , and stuff . I also recommend Secondhand Lions if you like Michael Caine and Robert Duvall . All of this is My opinion . Thanks !
516486	1132073	251369	7.0	Joe Estevez returns in The Remnant !	Minor SpoilersAfter just coming out we had to see it . It sounded really good and it was a good film . It has a low budget but it doesn't matter as long as the film is good . The Remnant is produced and directed by Rick Jordan . He is also the villian in the movie as well and he plays the role very good but this here isn't the story , the story is Joe Estevez ! I thought he was going to beat his great role in Werewolf but he didn't . I'M not saying that he acted bad in the Remnant but his role in Werewolf is just so much better . That role as joel was a masterpiece ! Now as for The Remnant it was a good film but don't expect it to be a super b-flick like I did .
517390	1132073	83767	8.0	Creepshow !	Creepshow is a good multi segment horror movie ! I don't want to spoil any thing for you but My favorite story of the film is The Crate with Adrienne Barbeau ! It really a awesome story ! If you like horror films especially one with several stories then you'll love the horror fest that is known as Creepshow ! !
516782	1132073	57076	8.0	The second 007 film ! Robert Shaw's villain was awesome !	The second 007 James bond film has its moments indeed . Robert Shaw's villain was something else . The fight between him and Bond was very realistic and exciting . I was surprised how the film ended . This is a good Bond film !
516933	1132073	270707	8.0	The Truth About Charlie !	The Truth About Charlie is a fair action film that stars Mark Wahlberg , Tim Robbins , Thandie Newton , Joong-Hoon Park , and Ted Levine ! There are many surprising moments in this picture . The action scenes are done very well . Wahlberg and Newton had good charisma together and they both looked really different . Tim Robbins was good as well . The chase and action scenes were really neat . Jonathan Demme directing is great . The film is very different and being that it takes place in France this makes the film unique . Give this movie a chance because its a very different film and the cast are in some good roles . So anyone who likes Mark Wahlberg , Tim Robbins , Thandie Newton , and Ted Levine give it a chance and check it out !

516922	1132073	339135	8.0	Very different film for Van Damme !	Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest film In Hell is in My opinion is his most different film to date . He was good as always and its unbelievable that Lawrence Taylor had a big role in this movie . It has some interesting characters and some good action . Some of the stuff is really brutal . I was surprised to see Juan FernÃ¡ndez in such a bizarre role but he played it good ! Robert LaSardo is also in the movie along with the huge Michael Bailey Smith ! In Hell in My opinion is a decent film but not Van Damme's all time best but the movie does give him different things to do here . If you love Van Damme check out In Hell ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you are a big fan of Van Damme then check out these other great films ! Bloodsport ( one of his best ! ) Cyborg ( one of his best ! ) , Kickboxer ( very good ! ) , Lion Heart ( one of his best ! ) , Death Warrant , Universal Soldier ( Terrific film ! ) , Hard Target ( in My opinion his best film ever and to be honest I feel its one of the best movies ever made ! ) , Street Fighter , Sudden Death ( great ! ) , The Quest ( great ! ) , and Double Team ( very good ! ) !
517099	1132073	99697	8.0	Stephen King's Graveyard Shift !	Stephen King's Graveyard shift is a very different but styling film . Brad Dourif's performance was very good as The Exterminator ! The monster is very different and should please most Stephen King , horror , and monster fans .

Yaphet Kotto acted very well ! Live and Let Die is a good 007 film and if you like James Bond and Roger Moore then look no further to Live and Let Die !
516780	1132073	309377	9.0	A good Clint Eastwood movie !	Blood Work is one Clint Eastwood's best movies ever ! He acted great and the since with him and the shotgun was something ! Jeff Daniels acted good too . Anjelica Houston looked very good and Wanda De Jesus looked stunning ! If you like Clint Eastwood and cop / murder mystery films than look none other than Blood Work !
516994	1132073	100589	9.0	Good killer primate film !	Shakma is a good film and the Baboon is very mean . He maybe cute and neat looking but I know I wouldn't want him anywhere near Me . Roddy McDowall was very good and Christopher Atkins was good . If you like horror films about killer primates like Link or Monkey Shines then Shakma is one to watch !
517301	1132073	150377	9.0	Good film !	Tommy Lee Jones and and Ashley Judd are very good in the film . It is really a good mystery and revenge film ! The characters Jones and Judd play are very likable . The film has some intense action and emotional scenes . If you like Jones and Judd then watch Double Jeopardy !
517502	1132073	98439	9.0	Stallone & Russell !	Tango & Cash is a very good 1980s action film that stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell ! Yes , That's right two great action stars together in a movie ! They both act together very well in this movie ! I was thrilled to see them together ! Its a treat in My opinion ! Teri Hatcher , Jack Palance , Brion James , James Hong , and Marc Alaimo all put on very good performances . Stallone , Russell , Palance , and James all looked really neat ! Hatcher also looked amazingly good ! There are so many familiar faces that are in this movie in brief roles and they are Philip Tan , Michael J . Pollard , Robert Z'Dar , Lewis Arquette , Edward Bunker , Michael Jeter , Clint Howard , Elizabeth Sung , Roy Brocksmith , Billy Blanks , Richard L . Duran , Saveli Kramarov , Geoffrey Lewis , Salvador Espinoza , Andre Rosey Brown , and Phil Rubenstein ! The acting like I said is good . There is a bit of comedy here as well that is funny . The movie's action is top notch ! There are some really explosive action scenes , and story is good and its always interesting in My opinion . The music by Harold Faltermeyer was good and fit the film nicely . The direction by Andrei Konchalovsky and Albert Magnoli is decent . Tango & Cash is a fine cop movie to watch and if you like Stallone , Russell , Palance , Hatcher , and any of the actors mentioned above then I strongly recommend you watch this movie ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : The following is something I noticed that some viewers may not know ! Isn't it strange that Kurt Russell and James Hong are together again in a movie ? Before they were battling it out in Big Trouble in Little China ! Brion James and Saveli Kramarov is in this film together and they were also in Armed and Dangerous . Same thing with Roy Brocksmith and Marc Alaimo because they were in Total Recall . Its just something interesting I noticed !
517243	1132073	84556	9.0	Q : The Winged Serpent !	Q : The Winged Serpent is a very different film ! The cast was very good ! Larry Cohen's direction was good ! The music was good ! The monster was excellent looking and looked very realistic ! I highly recommend Q : The Winged Serpent !

517343	1132073	198267	10.0	good one !	I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious like the Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do !

In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a great Three Stooges short and it has become one of My favorites ! I just love it when Joe Palma talks to Cy Schindell and says about the corpse moving and Schindell says something like sure if he'd have wings he'd fly away , maybe I should ask if he is dead and Curly replies and Schindell says to Palma that see he told you himself that he was dead and then they realize what has just happened . Its hilarious ! Great one from beginning to end !

517523	1132073	277296	10.0	The Scorpion King !	I am a very big fan of the Mummy movies and The Scorpion King film is decent ! I'm a big fan of the Conan movies as well and to Me The Scorpion King isn't like them at all . The Scorpion King delivers all of the goods . Tons on nonstop action , a little humor , and great sets . The actors were good as well . The Rock did an excellent job for his first major motion picture and Michael Clarke Duncan looked more massive than ever before . His performance was great ! The long fight between the huge men was awesome ! Steven Brand was tremendous as Memnon . The way he performed made you believe he was the greatest fighter at the time . Ralph Moeller looked excellent and he did great as a villain . His accent was really cool . I was glad to see Grant Heslov make a good appearance and in fact I think he did just as good as he did in True Lies and Congo . Kelly Hu performed good . Branscombe Richmond , Bernard Hill , Peter Facinelli , Roger Rees , Al Leong , Gus Rethwisch , Peter Navy Tuiasosopo , and the legendary wrestler Tyler Mane all have brief roles which they all perform well . Great music by John Debney ! Chuck Russell is a great and underrated director in My opinion and directs everything in this movie greatly especially the sword fights between Mathayus and Balthazar . This is the movie where you see the Scorpion King become the first Pharaoh of Egypt ! All Mummy movie , action , Egyptian , Rock and fans of the actors mentioned above must see this movie !
517268	1132073	416243	10.0	What in the world happened here ?	Submerged starring Steven Seagal ! Its his newest film released on DVD and I have very mixed emotions about it . I liked it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I didn't like it . I'll go through the good and the bad below . THE GOOD 2 OK : The fights : YEAH ! ! ! Steven Seagal fights Gary Daniels ! Camera shots : The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie . The actors : Steven Segal and Gary Daniels together in a film and they fight each other ! Is this a sign that other well known martial arts actors will be in Seagal's future movies ? William Hope and Vinny Jones have appearances . The two women were neat . THE BAD 2 WORST : Seagal's talking : He'd change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that wasn't bad enough he'd change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we're all used too . What the heck was up with that ? The fights : There was only a couple but they were OK because they weren't long I mean extremely brief ! Daniels was no match for Seagal as he got killed by Seagal . The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and Seagal ! I mean dang it , a guy like that should have lasted longer ! Nick Brimble : Was he trying be Jack Palance or thought he was him ? Plot : It was confusing as everything just jumped around back and fourth , back and fourth ! The color : The color kept on changing and changing ! Why ? The dialog : Examples : ( Gary Daniels : I'm taking over this Submerine now ! Steven Seagal : You're just gonna have to kill me I guess . . . ) ( Steven Seagal : Let me ask you a question . What kind of damn fool do you think I am ? I'm still in prison for doing the same thing you're about to ask me to do again ) . I thought a lot of the dialog was funny and I laughed at most of it . The camera work : Why was there so much camera effects ? It seemed funny because even when someone got killed they didn't fall like they should . Instead it seemed like they skipped a spaces and got to the ground earlier than you'd expect ? The opera concert : Hopw the conductor looked up and here and there when guys were getting killed . Surely everything that seemed funny was unintentional ? Right ? There many other points I could point out but there are too many of them . You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its films . I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious moments in films and of course Seagal completest and hardcore fans . Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies ! Above the Law , Hard to Kill , Marked for Death ( Must see because it great ! ) , Out for Justice ( Great ! ) , Under Siege , On Deadly Ground ( Really good ! ) , Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory ( Very good ! ) , The Glimmer Man ( In My opinion his all time best and one of the greatest films ever ! ) , Fire Down Below ( Excellent ! ) , The Patriot , Ticker , The Foreigner ( Surprising great ! ) , Out for a Kill , Belly of the Beast , and Into the Sun ( Great sword fighting ) !

The cast includes Bill Paxton , Bridget Fonda , Billy Bob Thornton , Brent Briscoe , John Paxton , Gary Cole , and the movie is directed by Sam Raimi ! The cast all acted really well . Bill Paxton was really the same as he always is which is great acting ! Billy Bob looked different and so did Fonda . Gary Cole was good but I think Brent Briscoe did one heck of an acting performance ! The music is by veteran composer Danny Elfman and his music in this film is is very good ! Sam Raimi did an excellent job directing this flick . The movie always keeps your attention with it great story . You follow these characters and see them get into one situation after another which this is one of the many things that keeps you wanting find out what is going to happen in the end ! Great movie and if you like Bill Paxton and the other cast members then I strongly recommend you watch this film today !
517504	1132073	334541	10.0	Great Tremors movie !	Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins star Michael Gross ! He returns in this prequel and he is playing a different character but he plays the great-grandfather of Burt Gummer in the other films ! He is very good in this picture just like he was in the other films ! Veteran bad guy actor Billy Drago really surprised Me with his role as Black Hand Kelly ! In My opinion he did a great acting performance in this movie ! He looked really neat the way he was dressed . His character was one of a kind in My opinion ! The rest of the cast was good . The special effects look great ! The musical score by Jay Ferguson was good and it has decent direction by S . S . Wilson ! Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins in My opinion is a good and welcomed addition to the Tremors series !

517810	1132073	89469	10.0	Legend is a beautiful Movie ! Ultimate Edition comment !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time . Legend is a fantastic movie ! I have seen this beautiful film countless times . There is just so much in this film and everything is wonderful . The prologue is a very interesting reading and after you hear the bell sounds get ready to see a visually stunning epic of greatness , love , action , and darkness ! This movie here is one of the greatest that I have ever seen . By watching the original theatrical version and the Director's Cut of the film on the Ultimate Legend DVD I have realized that Legend is indeed arguably the greatest movie ever filmed and even though there are two versions they are equal . What makes The Director's Cut different is it longer with added scenes , more character development , and has a different musical score by Jerry Goldsmith . The actors that are in this make the characters just so wonderful and full of personality , the music by Tangerine Dream and Jerry Goldsmith is just so extraordinary , two of the greatest score ever written in My opinion , the action is tremendous , the scenery is just so neat , and I just could go on and on . The actors in this as I mentioned are great . Even though Tom Cruise is not one of My favorites his performance is great . A likable character . Mia Sara is just lovely in this film . I just can't believe how Tim Curry played Darkness . His voice is incredible . Curry has arguably the greatest performance ever in this film . Out of all of the dozens of great villains in movies Darkness is My favorite . David Bennent , Alice Playten , Billy Barty , and Cork Hubbert are very good . Ian Longmur and Mike Crane as the Demon Cooks are excellent . Legend is really special . I strongly recommend that you purchase the Ultimate Edition of Legend on DVD at Amazon . com like I did and I hope everyone has the chance to see this masterpiece .

Leaving the show , I was only disappointed in one thing and that is I wanted to see it again . The monster in it is so neat . The acting is very good , the suspence is great and the violence and gore terribly good . Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore are very good in this . They both look great ! John Whitmore is very good and keep your eye open for Audra Lindley as Dr . Zwiezic . She has a short part but its a great one at that . There is so much that happens in this movie I can't begain to tell but I will say this , I love it when you see the city and you know that this and that is happening , it pumps you up when you watch The Relic ! The special effects is top notch and well , everything is just great . This is one of MY favorite movies . This movie is misunderstood and I wish more people would watch it and appreciate The Relic and know how great this movie is . The Relic has such a creepy , scary presence you don't know whats going to happen next type of atmosphere and thats why I love this movie . This is a great extravaganza superb monster fest ! The music is excellent . It is by John Debney ( Cutthroat Island , ) . Its his best next to Cutthroat Island . WARNING : If you have a weak stomach and can't stand to see monsters mauling , mutaling , destroying , and decapitating people's helpless bodies then please don't watch The Relic but If you like very scary and viloent horror movies then this is the best one you will ever see !

I have seen Godzilla 1985 well over 20 times I'M sure . This is the best of all of the Godzilla films ! This Godzilla movie just perfect . The beginning of it is great . I like how the big boat is in the storm and then all of a sudden Godzilla awakes out of the island and you hear his wonderful roar ! It doesn't take a long time when we first see Godzilla and when we do he causes great destruction at a nuclear factory . Seeing Raymond Burr older with a beard is something and his presence in Godzilla 1985 is an emotional one . The end of of the movie is very sad or atleast it is to ME . I cry every time I see Godzilla going into the volcano , he roars and roars and I just cry and cry . Raymond Burr says a powerful message at the end . There are many other Godzilla films including our own version but it is nothing like this . Like I said this is the greatest Godzilla movie of all . Watch it and see .

516841	1132073	53559	10.0	Great movie ! Its a REAL ghost and horror movie in my opinion .	13 Ghosts is a classic ! The whole movie is just great ! Good music , acting and everything ! Its excellent and it feels good to watch it too ! There is just something about this film that makes it so good ! Its really a good film to watch around Halloween !
517113	1132073	35928	10.0	Good Three Stooges short ! A classic !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! Dudley Dickerson , Al Hill , Fred Kelsey , Al Thompson , and John Tyrrell are in this Three Stooges classic ! I think this is arguably one of the best Three Stooges shorts . The beginning is hilarious when The Stooges are cleaning up the joint and the shoot out scenes the cops and robbers was good as well . I strongly recommend A Gem of a Jam !
516809	1132073	88760	10.0	A great film but its just too sad for ME .	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Baby : The Lost Legend is a great film but it is just to sad . I have seen this movie many times and each time I cry . I don't want to go into detail . A note to Parents : If your children don't like to see Dinosaurs get hurt then please don't show them this because it will upset them and yes the scenes are that emotional . I recommend to show you kids either or all three films of Jurassic Park , The Lost World : Jurassic Park II and Jurassic Park / / / if your kids like to see Dinosaurs at their best and not getting hurt . I'M not saying Baby : The Lost Legend is a bad film , no it isn't at all . It has a tremendous build up , a good story , good acting , wonderful looking Dinosaurs , excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith , and it does have a good ending but its what happens before that . Please take MY advise or view the film before your children do please .
516959	1132073	192175	10.0	Good one !	I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are like the hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do ! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today !
516485	1132073	88772	10.0	Boggy Creek II is a good movie .	Minor spoilersI saw Boggy Creek 2 a long time ago when it came out and I really liked it and I still do . With out spoiling much the budget and stuff isn't big here but we do see the Boggy Creek creature several times and he doesn't look cheap . The acting is pretty good and the film is always interesting . Infact it can be scary at times especialy the beggining of the film . I really don't see why this film is bad . I have seen it many , many times and each time was good . If your looking a REAL Bigfoot type movie besides Harry and the Hendersons this is the one to see , rent , or even buy !

All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This Three Stooges short is an excellent one and is actually quite violent for its time . Kenneth MacDonald and Christine McIntyre are good together in this one and also in their separate scenes . Cy Schindell was also good . The Stooges are as funny as ever ! There is another Three Stooges short very similar like this one called Hot Ice which it has an alternate ending .
517682	1132073	94226	10.0	A great movie !	The Untouchables is really a great movie . I don't want to spoil it but I will say this . It a great cast and action ! The lengthy scene when Sean Connery is in his apartment was a rough , violent , and gory scene . What happened in it was just totally unexpected and a shock if you didn't read the book and follow the lives of these real life characters . Good acting from Kevin Costner , Sean Connery , Andy Garcia , Robert De Niro , and Charles Martin Smith ! Every one's performance was good especially from Billy Drago ! His performance as Frank Nitti was cold hearted ! He had no remorse whatsoever ! Sean Connery was very good and this is arguably his best performance . If you like true stories action and mobster films then check out The Untouchables !
517769	1132073	35899	10.0	Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man !	This is one of the best sequels in the Universal Monsters series ! The monsters look great !

517637	1132073	426843	10.0	The 1998 MLB All-Star Game !	One of the most exciting and arguably the greatest Major League Baseball All-Star games was the 1998 edition . There were many surprising moments in this game and every second of it in My opinion was exciting ! So many great players were chosen in this game . Including Andres Galarraga , Mark McGwire , Larry Walker , Dante Bichette , Vinny Castilla , A-Rod , Chipper Jones , Paul O'Neil , and so many other greats ! One of the many things I like about the All-Star game is that the viewer gets to see some of the greatest MLB players the sport has to offer that some states in America and even other countries don't get the chance to watch . It always seems that the American League has the upper hand but I for one will never count out the National League . I am a huge Baseball fan and just love everything about the sport ! When the first moment on Joe Buck and company broadcast the game you know its gonna be an epic event ! If you are a Baseball fan and are able to watch this game on TV or even on tape do so because its a classic ! I recommend it !

516783	1132073	73195	10.0	Jaws ! ! !	Jaws is an epic movie and it is My favorite shark film . Great acting by Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss but the acting was superb in My opinion by Robert Shaw ! The shark itself was awesome ! The view of the water in Jaws is spooky and it makes you feel that anything can be in it ! The music by John Williams is great and the direction by Steven Spielberg is terrific ! Jaws has three other sequels but they aren't classics like this ! If you like shark movies and haven't seen Jaws or even if you have check out Jaws today !
517556	1132073	172345	10.0	Good movie !	This movie that Wes Craven Presents called Don't Look Down is actually a very good movie ! Its not predictable or at least I didn't think it was . It always keeps you going and makes you wonder what is going to happen next ! All of the cast members that are in the film act solidly . The music is very good especially the end credits by J . Peter Robinson . Like I said above its a good mystery and keeps you on the edge of your seat ! Its not gory so die hard Wes Craven fans will be disappointed about but like the other movie Wes Craven presented They ( which I might add that in My opinion is one of the best horror movies ever ) which it didn't have gore either so a horror movie doesn't always need to be gory to be scary . I that Don't Look Down is good film and I recommend it to all horror , thriller , and mystery fans !
517225	1132073	114369	10.0	Seven is one great movie I recommend strongly !	Se7en is excellent thrilling mystery that has a great cast ! Brad Pitt was very good and at the when he found out , his acting was superb ! Morgan Freeman was also excellent ! Kevin Spacey played John Doe flawlessly ! Gwyneth Paltrow was good . R . Lee Ermey was good as always ! It was surprising to see Richard Roundtree in the movie . John C . McGinley had a small part which he did good for the limited time he got to perform and Richard Portnow was good . The music by Howard Shore was very good . David Fincher's directing was unique ! The last part of the movie when John Doe turns himself , when he is in the car with Pitt and Freeman , and when they were on the desert and the helicopter scenes were through the binoculars , and when Pitt and Freeman were going back and forth , that entire scene is one of the greatest in cinematic history ! This film is really horrifying and not for the squeamish but if you love gruesome murder mystery movies this is a great one to watch !
517079	1132073	114194	10.0	A great movie !	The Prophecy is an excellent movie and is one of deepest films that I have seen . I won't give any info about the film except that the performance Christopher Walken was awesome ! Plus other good performances by Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen ! Adam Goldberg and Amanda Plummer was OK . Eric Stoltz was great and his angel character is so likable . Viggo Mortensen was absolutely terrific ! The music is very good ! The Prophecy is a great film and has two other sequels but in My opinion they are nothing like this . I recommend every to see this film !
517222	1132073	36727	10.0	Great one !	This has become one of My favorite Three Stooges shorts with Curly ! I really like Vern Dent as Fuller Bull . Dick Curtis and Bud Jamison was really good ! The entire little film is hilarious ! Good story and entertainment ! I recommend it !
517221	1132073	90660	10.0	Great John Candy movie !	Armed and Dangerous is one of John Candy's best films ! Eugene Levy , Meg Ryan , Brion James , Robert Loggia , James Tolkan , Kenneth McMillan , and Tom Lister Jr . were all good . I loved the performance Lister and Candy did together ! I don ' t like to make fun of anybody but it was so funny every time Candy would make fun of him and I loved Lister doing his Zeus Trademark in the film ! If are a fan of John Candy and the above cast mention and love hilarious action packed comedies with good music then I strongly recommend that you watch this classic movie soon !

516495	1132073	370263	10.0	AVP : Alien Vs . Predator is one outstanding film !	One of the most anticipated films in history is AVP : Alien Vs . Predator ! After many years of waiting for this ultimate feature film it finally arrives in the year 2004 ! Was it as good as the original Alien saga & Predator saga ( Alien - 1979 , Aliens - 1986 , Alien 3 - 1992 , Alien Resurrection - 1997 , Predator - 1987 , Predator 2 - 1990 ) ? I think so in My opinion . Did it live up to the hype ? Yes ! Was the film what I expected ? It was actually much more than what I had expected . Was the musical score great ? Heck yes ! Does newcomer composer Harald Kloser have a winning score like the other films do ? OH YES ! Does Paul W . S . Anderson deliver great direction ? He delivers it all ! I am I happy with the film overall ? A big yes ! Why ? I will explain further as I go on . The film has one of the most different castings including Lance Henriksen , Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Ewen Bremner , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flanagan , Ian Whyte and Tom Woodruff Jr . Henricksen has now been in three Alien films and now a Predator film ! An interesting thing is now that he has been in Alien , Predator , and Terminator films which is really unusual . Readers of Dark Horse comics will now what I'm talking about . Anyway Lance acts very good in this film . Lathan and Bova also are pretty good in it . In the film Bova reminded a lot of actor Olivier Martinez . Tommy Flanagan was also good and he looked quite different in this picture . Everyone else is good . Since Kevin Peter Hall is sadly no longer with us his presence is missed very much as the Predator but the new Predator played by the huge Ian Whyte plays this classic role very well and he has a very convincing performance as a Predator . The Predators looks as great as ever ! They all have different personalities especially the played by Whyte . As for the Aliens they too look as great as ever ! The Alien Queen looks as awesome as ever and she really gets respect in this one . I was so disappointed how the Alien Queen was in Alien Resurrection . Fans of this Alien character will admire her in this film ! The story of the film is really good . I am really surprised about the theories in this . Honestly I believe these theories and in My opinion there may be some truth in this film . The special effects are just tremendous ! I was amazed by how realistic everything is ! The action is also tremendous and I love the camera work . It was outstanding to see the Aliens and Predators together ! The musical score by Harald Kloser is just wonderful . He doesn't use any of the music in the previous films by Jerry Goldsmith , James Horner , Alan Silvestri etc . but he has his own themes and such . I just love the theme he composed and the other music such as the alien fights . Another thing I just really love about it is the magical sounding in some places . I recommend that you do what I did buy the score from Amazon . com . Its truly a wonderful score . The creature effects by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr . is just as great as the previous works in the previous films . The direction by Paul W . S . Anderson is just great . I love the way he made this film . He is one of My favorite directors and if there is a sequel to this film or one of the titled characters I would love for him to direct it . Well , this is My opinion of the film . I am pleased with it even though the film goes by very fast but I think that's because the film is action packed and just that great ! If you are a hardcore Alien and Predator film fan , Alien and Predator comic fan , and / or fan of the two in general and like Lance Henriksen , Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Tommy Flanagan , the rest of the cast , Paul W . S . Anderson , and want to hear some of the greatest music then I strongly recommend that you head over to you local video or department store or stop by Amazon . com and buy the DVD or VHS today !

516542	1132073	96874	10.0	All week of BTTF II on the Starz ! Channel comments !	Back to the Future is a great movie and it is part of a great trilogy . Many people may not like the time travel movies but I do and BTTF trilogy is the movies for Me . I just love the fact that one of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd is in all three of them and I just love the way he is in them and not to mention Michael J . Fox , Thomas F . Wilson and most of the others are in the three films . Part II continues where part I left off greatly ! This film takes place in the future and that's all I'M gonna tell because I don't want to spoil anything . BTTF part II is great ! I came a cross the week showing of Back to the Future Part II on Starz ! and yet I can't believe that they had it on this long every night at 1 : 05 but by watching it this much it made Me realize to pay attention to the main characters / actors are and I think they all should have won an award especially Thomas F . Wilson . I just love his acting as the many characters he plays greatly ! He deserves much credit ! I just love the relationship between the Doc and Marty . Christopher Lloyd is one of My favorite actors of all time and I just love his character and Michael J . Fox is one good actor himself ! I have always loved the Back To The Future trilogy but now I have a high respect for it especially for this one . Its one of the smartest , most entertaining , and one of the greatest series ever ! I recommend it to everyone ! I came a cross the week showing of Back to the Future Part II on Starz ! and yet I can't believe that they had it on this long every night at 1 : 05 ( / 03 - / 03 and as of this writing sadly its over ) but by watching it this much it made Me realize to pay attention to the main and other characters / actors and I think they all should have won an award especially Thomas F . Wilson . I just love his acting as the many characters he plays greatly ! I think Griff is so cool , old Biff is really smart , alternate Biff is really great villain if you can call him that , and young Biff is just as cool as Griff ! Biff's gang ( young and older played by Billy Zane , J . J . Cohen Casey Siemaszko ) is funny and Griff's gang ( played by Ricky Dean Logan , Spike , Jason Scott Lee ) are really cool especially Spike ! Elisabeth Shue's Jennifer Parker is really good and yet different than Claudia Wells ' Jennifer and it really hard for Me to decide who I like the most as I like how they both performed ! I just love the the relationship between the Doc and Marty . Christopher Lloyd is one of My favorite actors of all time and I just love his character and Michael J . Fox is one good actor himself ! I have always loved the Back To The Future trilogy but now I have a high respect for it especially for this one . Its one of the smartest , most entertaining , enjoyable and one of the greatest series ' ever and this movie here is one of the best ! Classic film making ! I recommend it to everyone ! Movie Nuttball's Note : During the scene where young and old Biff are in the car garage and old Biff turns old the radio . Listen to the voice of the announcer , its John Erwin the voice of the original and classic Prince Adam / He-Man of the great He-Man and the Masters of the Universe animated series ! Another scene where in 2015 Marty McFly plays the old classic ARCADE game Wild Gunman look for a very young Elijah Wood of the epic Lord of the Rings series . According to the IMDb Back to the Future Part II was his first movie ! Look for Charles " Roger Rabbit " Fleischer in this film !

The story is very good and The Stooges are very funny . I recommend this short !
517794	1132073	308527	10.0	MTV Video Music Awards 1992 !	Back when things were different in 1992 one very anticipated event was the MTV Music Awards ! The show was lengthy as always but it had a different look and feel to it . With Dana Carvey being the host and have a little comedy with David Spade with Andrew Dice Clay and Ringo Starr . There were so many countless stars on this show . There was a big thunder storm the night it was on and the power went off a while and I never found out if My favorite band Metallica performed . James Hetfield and the gang are listed here but I am not sure . I know Pearl Jam , and The Red Hot Chilli Peppers performed and it was cool how Ice T looked . The show was good but the best thing that happened was Nirvana's performance ! The performance was totally unpredictable ! Kurt Cobain's looks was so cool and it seemed like he was making up new words in the songs Lithium . The performance was nuts ! He just trashed his guitar like it was nothing ! This show is so much different compared to how it is now . If you watched it back then I'm sure you know what I mean ! If there is any way you can watch this very show on tape do so because it was cool !
