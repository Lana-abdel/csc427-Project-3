517448	1132073	120753	1.0	The Million Dollar Waste !	Why in the whole world was this movie made ? How could it of been released with such a story and who would want to make a film with such a story and its sub-angles ? Even more questionable is why in the world did Mel Gibson even think if he'd want to be in this film ? Beats Me ! This movie is so incredibly stupid its even worse than a than asking a very grouchy person a question a hundred times in row ! Gibson's great talent is so misused here . I am surprised that this didn't hurt Milla Jovovich's career . Tim Roth is totally wasted in this film . And what in the world was with Jimmy Smits ' character ? His character was so unnecessary . I won't even go about Bono ! Many films that are good are on the IMDb Bottom 100 list . Why isn't this ? This needs to replace one and quickly too ! I don't recommend this film to anyone unless they want to see great actors being total jokes in a sucky film .
516884	1132073	438323	1.0	A disappointment : (	The Flight of the Phoenix remake DVD has a nice bonus under the Special Features menu . A short Documentary called Phoenix Diaries ! Dennis Quaid , Miranda Otto , Giovanni Ribisi , Tyrese , and more make appearances in this forty-minute plus feature . This is a behind the scenes look at the film and stuff . I don't think that this one was an enjoyable as it could it have been . Why ? I will tell you ! Its all because of John Moore . Is it actually necessary to get all hyper and yelling like that ? Was it necessary to say the ' F ' word dozens of times in front of the camera while being interviewed ? I don't think so ! Who the heck does he think he is ? I sure wouldn't want to be in his one of his films especially since he threatens to kill you if you do something wrong . I mean if that is his way of joking he can lose it right now because its not funny ! As you can tell I don't like his personality . It is so unneeded to be like that ! A couple of the other actors even the ' F ' word but I think it because being around him . So I thought that I would warn you viewers if 1 . Foul language and unneeded fit throwing is not your game , 2 . If you wanted to see a pleasant making of the film because this isn't , 3 . If you have young children interested in watching documentaries . I hope that this has been helpful , Thanks for reading !
516682	1132073	200755	1.0	Very disappointing dinosaur movie : (	Minor SpoilersThe following is in My opinionI thought this film was going to be spectacular with all kinds of dinosaurs and action ! Boy was I disappointed : ( I don't mind films that have a lot of dialogue but this was supposed to be an adventure / dinosaurs film and is I got was the relationships between the people . This was well over two hours and I believe it was about three in a half or so and I was so disappointed about this . If want to rent or purchase this film please don't rush it because if you like any Jurassic Park film of any dinosaur film for that matter I think just about any dino movie would beat this any day because at least even the worst dino films had the guts to show the dinos and don't let the box of th film fool you because that great looking T-Rex on the box is no where to be seen in this never ending no-dino fest : ( Avoid this movie !
517028	1132073	104240	2.0	A very disappointing movie indeed : (	With Jeff Goldblum being the star I thought this was going to be a dark murder mystery but I was very disappointed with this movie . I don't know if the movie tried to be a moral movie about don't do drugs , talk to your parents if you have something bad on your mind , or a murder mystery ? Why was other top notch actors such as Samuel L . Jackson , John C . McGinley , and Famke Janssen used in the film ? McGinley was uncredited and I don't know why ? What was really the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette as the psychic ? All four had such short roles in the film . Through out the beginning is all there was the big talk about the chew and didn't find out what the chew is until the middle . I really don't know what I watched . Jeff Goldblum performed very well . If you must watch this movie prepare for a hundred minute boring fest ! If you are not sure about renting the film or not don't let the box fool you ! Avoid it no matter what you do ! Though if you want to see another Goldblum movie however watch the superior Mister Frost !
517837	1132073	254871	5.0	Wishmaster 3 !	The Wishmaster series is a very different series . In this Wishmaster Andrew Divoff is gone as the the Djinn though the new plays the character well . The film in My opinion isn't as good as the first one but it is gory but its a film for horror fans ! . If you like Michael Myers , Freddy , and Jason , then you'll love the Djinn , the Wishmaster !
517299	1132073	92115	5.0	A disappointing horror film : (	Troll was really a good project that in My opinion was handled poorly . The cast was really good but they did their best . Poor Noah Hathaway , the great young actor of The Neverending Story had to be a part of this . Michael Moriarty's character was a joke and his character's wife no only looked liked but wanted to be Kay Lenz . Why in the world was Sonny Bono in this ? Poor little Phil Fondacaro . You get so attached to his character and then that stupid thing happens to him . Julia Louis-Dreyfus ' character was had potential but when she danced and teased the viewer that was enough and what was with not using June Lockhart as the one to stop the troll but then her character is played by her real life daughter and then she suddenly gets defeated ? The Troll looked very good though . I hate to bash any film but I just ain't satisfied with this one though most horror fans will !
517753	1132073	176799	5.0	The film was great until the end .	Hangman is a fair film that has a good cast which includes Lou Diamond Phillips , Mädchen Amick , Mark Wilson , Vince Corazza , Robert Haley , Grant Nickalls , Rosemary Dunsmore , Stephanie Moore , Dan Lauria , Judah Katz , and Eric Skye Erickson . The acting by all of these actors is very good . The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good . The only downfall is the sex and nudity scene when Amick is on the guy . I thought that was silly and lowered the film and which I thought brought the excitement of the film down a few stars however , the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like Lou Diamond Phillips , Mädchen Amick , Mark Wilson , Vince Corazza , Robert Haley , Grant Nickalls , Rosemary Dunsmore , the rest of the cast in the film , Action , Thrillers , Crime , Dramas , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
517234	1132073	265104	6.0	The Highlander fights Dracula in a very dark area of the world which is called darkness .	Minor SpoilersI watched this movie on Starz and I didn't know what to expect . Well what I got was a mixed up movie . The story is simple : A cop fights a vampire with the help from another vampire . It was like watching two movies at the same time , a highlander film and murder mystery all in one . Bokeem Woodbine is a cop and he finds out that vampires are real and that there is thousands of them living all over the globe . His new partner Adrian Paul is a vampire aswell . Theres lots of action in it and happenings and bizare ellements . The vampire make up isn't bad looking , actully it was pretty neat . I don't know why this movie wasn't a direct to video release or even in theatres ? Make sure you see it on tv or rent it on video when it is available . You'll have to watch this one atleast a couple times to get everything . If you like Blade or Highlander you'll love the The Breed ! Note : Was it just ME or did Bokeem Woodbine act like Miguel Ferrer ?
517831	1132073	301327	7.0	Good action movie with scenes from other films !	This Treat Williams film was good but most of it is scenes from other films such as Predator and Last Action Hero . The original scenes are good but the film is just an entertaining action film . If you like Williams then I recommend you to see Deep Rising as I think it is his best film .
516535	1132073	64904	7.0	Different flick !	Hatchet for the Honeymoon is one of those drive in type movies which this one is a strange one indeed ! The acting is good by the film's actors . The music seemed to Me like it didn't know what it wanted to sound like if it wanted to be a score for a horror film or a love story . Some of the music I thought sounded very similar like the classic movie Infra-Man ! There is some killing but there isn't much gore or anything graphic in this picture . I really don't know what else to say about this flick other than it is really , really different . This is part of a double feature which the other on the tape is called Anatomy of a Psycho which is also a fair oldie ! The movie is not perfect and maybe on the strange side of things but like I said its weird so give this movie a chance if you like old bizarre horror movies .
516500	1132073	300556	7.0	Timeline !	One of the most talked about films is Timeline . The movie has such a different history . With all of the editing , re-shoots , and the hiring a different composer it change the film a lot . Paul Walker , Frances O'Connor , Gerard Butler , Billy Connolly , David Thewlis , Anna Friel , Michael Sheen , Lambert Wilson , and Marton Csokas . Butler , Connolly , and Csokas have excellent performances here and all of the other actors are very good in this picture . The action is very good as well . The replacement of Brian Tyler is excellent . In My opinion this maybe his greatest score ever ! Richard Donner's direction is very good as well . The film may have a few flaws like a couple plot holes and too much action and not enough of explanation of the Timeline but really Timeline is a fantastic film . If you like the cast mentioned above and want to see a very good sword fight film then I recommend Timeline !
516478	1132073	211443	8.0	The immortal Jason Voorhees is back ! ! ! !	Minor Spoilers for Big Jason Maniacs . Jason was at it again . More monstrous then ever before Mr . Voorhees causes more destruction in Jason X ! I have seen most of the Friday the 13th movies with the monster Jason in them and most of them are very violent and gory and the second last installment Jason Goes To Hell was really plain silly . This Jason movie however is actually well written and has a bigger budget with some good effects . The battle between Jason and the android was neat . When Jason became Uber-Jason that was really good but near the end when the guy is trying to fool jason in the Crystal Lake area was believe it or not to ME was funny . I thought is was funny because the girls were stupid going in those sleeping bags and what happen ? Jason picked them bags ups and banged them against the trees repeatedly untill they were dead . This to ME is the best Jason film to date because less sex , nudity , a more a variety of Jason kills and and lots of action . All Jason fans check this one out soon !
517782	1132073	365677	8.0	Red Water !	The movie called Red Water is yet another shark film but it takes things in a different direction . It stars Lou Diamond Phillips , Kristy Swanson , and Coolio . The actors were good in the film and well in My opinion Lou Diamond is always good but Coolio had long part in the film and I found him quite funny believe it or not . The shark looks good but there isn't as much gore in the film compared to other shark films so gore fans maybe disappointed . The music is good and fits the film OK . The movie is OK and will give the viewer something interesting watch . If you want to see a shark movie that stars Lou Diamond Phillips , Kristy Swanson , and Coolio then watch Red Water today ! Movie Nuttball's Note : If you like shark films then I recommend you also see Jaws and Deep Blue Sea !
517360	1132073	63172	9.0	Great Godzilla and monster film !	This Toho monster film is very good . The all star cast of monsters is great but Baragon and Varan have little or no screen time . The newer version has an all new dubbing and digital recording which makes this serious film funny . If you love Godzilla and other Toho monsters then check Destroy All Monsters out today !
517522	1132073	281686	9.0	Bubba Ho-Tep !	Bubba Ho-Tep is a very , very different film . Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis arguably put on the best performances of their careers ! Campbell's Elvis is so realistic , so great , so human ! His looks , voice , and accent are almost identical like the real legend ! Ossie Davis's Jack is a cool character also and I thought his performance was a dandy ! Bob Ivy as Bubba Ho-Tep himself was a neat and unique looking mummy ! Brian Tyler's score was very good and fit the film well ! The movie has old fashion humor , great acting , and great conversations with Campbell and Davis ' characters ! If you like Bruce Campbell and are a big of the Evil Dead series especially Army of Darkness and like Ossie Davis then Bubba Ho-Tep is a great film to watch ! If you love mummy films I recommend the following : The Mummy ( 1932 ) , The Mummy ( 1959 ) , The Monster Squad ( 1987 ) The Mummy Lives ( 1993 ) , Tale of the Mummy ( 1998 ) , The MuMmy ( 1999 ) The MuMmy Returns ( 2001 ) , The Scorpion King ( 2002 ) , The MuMmy : The Animated Series ( 2001 ) , and The MuMmy : QUEST FOR THE LOST SCROLLS ( The MuMmy : The Animated Series ( 2001 ) VHS movie ) !
517187	1132073	97770	9.0	Good Stallone film !	This film is a good entertaining Stallone film . Donald Sutherland , Sonny Landham , and Tom Sizemore were all good . It is entertaining and its a good jail fighting film . I wouldn't say it is Stallone's best film but if like Stallone , the above mentioned actors , and action its worth a watch !
516472	1132073	282441	9.0	Good film , see it on video soon !	I saw this on video recently and its a good film and Billy Zane is great and in MY opinion this is his best on to date . The film itself could of been in a theatre easily and this film has action in it and it starts out with a bang . Any Billy Zane fan should check this one out !
516921	1132073	320691	9.0	Underworld !	Underworld is an action packed horror movie ! I think Kate Beckinsale was great in the film ! I really liked her look ! Seeing a woman with black pants , black shirt , and a long black jacket that can handle guns and fight with ease is truly an amazing thing to watch ! Bill Nighy played Viktor very well ! He was fixed up neat with all kinds make up ! Kevin Grevioux , who has been in many other films but most recognized in the 2001 version of the Planet of Apes was very good in Underworld ! The music is very good in the film and matches its dark nature ! The film has a very dark nature and I like the story where Vampires and Lycanthropes fight each other ! The special effects look good especially the scene with the moon ! Underworld is a decent horror film that takes the two legends of Vampires and Werewolves to a different stage . If you like Kate Beckinsale , these two different factions of monsters , horror , and action then I recommend you see Underworld !
517429	1132073	41098	9.0	Africa Screams with Abbott , Costello , Howard , & Besser !	This Abbott and Costello movie is decent . The duo is always great ! The Baer brothers were good ! What really makes this film interesting is the fact that two members of the legendary Three Stooges , ( who were not with each other at the time mind you ) Shemp Howard and Joe Besser are in the movie together ! Joe has bigger part than Shemp does and I was disappointed about this because Shemp was an incredibly talented individual ! The music was very good ! Africa Screams is funny film and if you wanted to see Abbott and Costello meet two of the Stooges & and to see how they are in Africa then see Africa Screams !
517218	1132073	71402	9.0	Death Wish !	The Death Wish films are some great movies . Charles Bronson is very good in them all especially the first and the third of the franchise . The first three are in My opinion the best in Death Wish series . In My opinion the films are not for young children . Its the trilogy directed by Michael Winner . The movies are packed with very realistic graphic violence , great music , good by acting the actors , and good directing . The first one is the one that started it all ! Charles Bronson is great in the film ! His emotions are very believable ! Jeff Goldblum believe it or not is in the film and has a big part ! He looks like a very young man . If you like Charles Bronson and want to see him bust up some punks and like to see great revenge films with great action then watch Death Wish !
516687	1132073	112281	9.0	Good sequel !	The sequel crazier than the prequel and has some really insane comedy but I can't help but laugh at it : ) Jim Carrey was very good and Bob Gunton was good . This film is arguably funnier than the original . I don't spoil it for you so if you like the cast I mentioned and really silly stuff and a very entertaining movie then watch Ace Ventura : Pet Detective !
516549	1132073	289043	9.0	Good horror film !	28 Days is really a strange movie . Its good though and it has some good acting from its actors including Brendan Gleeson , Cillian Murphy , Naomie Harris , and Christopher Eccleston . The film has some good music and fits the film well . Whenever the infected people or zombies attack is really amazing . They come running fast like mad men shown with awesome Gladiator type camera shots . Whenever the killers are on screen get ready for a tasty horror feast ! There is one scene in the film near the end that I haven't seen to many of and the other one that comes to mind is in Marked for Death starring Steven Seagal . Speaking of the end , The VHS version has an alternate ending after the end credits . 28 Days is good film and its quite different to watch and isn't too gory but isn't without it either so for horror and zombie fans , I strongly recommend this film !
517236	1132073	91003	9.0	The Eliminators is such a good movie , please come back on video	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Some minor spoilersI saw this movie only a couple times in the past but those two times I was grateful because I didn't know what I was in store for . I just love the cyborg guy and his arch rival . The special effects is some of the coolest I have ever seen . I loved it when Roy Dotrice shot the lightning bolts out of his hands and the woman , Bayou Betty , wow is she manly , boy she is something in it . I just loved the big boat chase in this film . I wish I could buy this movie this very minute but Hopefully it'll be on video very soon . I won't pass it up and I hope you don't either .
517359	1132073	162661	10.0	Cool spooky film !	This film is great ! Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a very dark film . The cast is good and I especially like Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman ! Johnny Depp Christina Ricci was good . Christopher Lee's short part was good and he performed very well ! Alun Armstrong , Ian McDiarmid , and Michael Gough were all good . The fights were great and yes the film is spooky ! If you haven't seen Sleepy Hollow is a good horror film to check out !
516837	1132073	83701	10.0	Good Looeny Tunes movie !	I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do ! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today !
516719	1132073	44007	10.0	Good Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of the most unique Three Stooges shorts is Scrambled Brains . In this short are Babe London , Emil Sitka , Vernon Dent , and Royce Milne . The acting by these actors are good especially by Dent and Sitka . There are many funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love ! In My opinion this one of the most different Three Stooges shorts . I strongly recommend this one !
517001	1132073	264395	10.0	Good film !	Basic is a very different film that has a good cast which includes John Travolta , Connie Nielsen , Samuel L . Jackson , Timothy Daly , Giovanni Ribisi , Brian Van Holt , Taye Diggs , and Harry Connick Jr . The acting by all of these actors is very good . Baldwin is really excellent in this film . I thought that he performed good . The mystery is really good and some of it is unbelievable . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good by Klaus Badelt . The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the last moment . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like John Travolta , Connie Nielsen , Samuel L . Jackson , and the rest of the cast in the film , action thrillers , dramas , and interesting films then I recommend this film !

I don't spoil it for you so if you like the cast I mentioned and really silly stuff and a very entertaining movie then watch Ace Ventura : Pet Detective !
517185	1132073	89880	10.0	Very good sequel to First Blood !	The sequel to First Blood , one of My favorites and is arguably one of the best films ever is actually a very decent movie ! The acting is good and Stallone and Crenna were really good . Charles Napier put on a good performance . The music by Jerry Goldsmith was very good but in My opinion it is nothing compared to First Blood's . If you liked First Blood check out Rambo : First Blood Part II ! It is really a good action packed film !
517290	1132073	453446	10.0	Alien Planet !	This is a very good program that aired on the Discovery Channel on / 05 and I think that this program was very interesting and informal one with theories and it is narrated very good by John C . McGinley . It shows many incredible and bizarre alien-like animals that vary in size from the size of small frog to the size of a large skyscraper building ! The CGI is excellent ! James Garvin , Stephen Hawking , Jack Horner , Michio Kaku , George Lucas , and J . Craig Venter give their insights to possible like of other planets ! In My opinion are are probably similar like these creature featured here plus much more ! If you can watch this on TV and like the subject and like to see theories of what could be out there and to know their possible origins then check out this amazing feature today or buy it on DVD ! Strongly Recommended !

Driven is a very movie that stars Sylvester Stallone , Burt Reynolds , Kip Pardue , Stacy Edwards , Til Schweiger , Gina Gershon , Estella Warren , Cristián de la Fuente , Brent Briscoe , and Robert Sean Leonard ! I think this is a one of Stallone's finest films ! All of the other actors were really good as well . Was it just Me or was Cristián de la Fuente a lot like Jean-Claude Van Damme in this picture ? The characters are likable . The music is good . The direction by Renny Harlin is excellent ! The race car action was fantastic ! I think that Driven is a very good movie and very exciting ! In My opinion it deserves much more than a 4 . 4 rating . If you haven't seen the movie and like Stallone and the other cast members and want to see great race car action then don't go by the very low rating and bad comments , just watch the movie ! I strongly recommend it !
516712	1132073	191423	10.0	Very different Scooby-Doo cartoon !	When this show was on I watched it every time I could ! I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious like the Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do ! If you like the original Looney Tunes then I strongly recommend that you watch this show !
516850	1132073	258463	10.0	The Bourne Identity is a cool action movie !	The Bourne Identity is superb movie with great action and suspense ! Matt Damon is really a action hero in this film and in My opinion he could be a new action star . Franka Potente was very good and she is a promising actress if she is the good roles . Chris Cooper was very good . Brian Cox was very good and he looked different than he did in earlier films . Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good but the role he was given didn't allow him to do much but he is becoming one of My favorite actors . TBI is a very good film with some great action scenes that I never saw before ! If you like Matt Damon and spy films then go rent The Bourne Identity !
517246	1132073	301470	10.0	Jeepers Creepers II ! An excellent sequel !	Jeepers Creepers 2 is one heck of a horror movie ! I love the first one and this was a must see ! The sequel did not disappoint Me at all ! Ray Wise had a very good performance ! Jonathan Breck was excellent as the Creeper ! The Creeper is such an unusual character / monster ! There is much we know about him but then there's so much more we don't know about him ! The Creeper has such a raw but interesting personality ! I really liked the chemistry Diane Delano , Thom Gossom Jr . , and Tom Tarantini had together ! When they are on screen it makes the movie really good ! I like the attention to the sky when the Creeper would fly ! It was so neat seeing the stars and the moon ! That radio report was something else ! I really liked how they talked about the burned church as it helps the movie tell what happened in the first ! A very clever idea ! The music by Bennett Salvay is excellent once again ! There are some scary and surprising moments in this film and you don't know who the Creeper will get next ! In My opinion there are some original and bizarre scenes and like him or not Victor Salva did an excellent job at directing this motion picture ! I hope there will be a third film ! If you liked the first one and have not seen this one or if you haven't seen the prequel and are thinking about seeing both movies then I recommend you see the first and then the second ! I strongly recommend Jeepers Creepers and Jeepers Creepers II !
517826	1132073	89652	10.0	My Science Project is a great movie ! One of the best movies of all time !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time . My Science Project is one of My favorite films of all . The first time I saw I it I loved it ! Its still as great today as it was then ! What I love about it is for one how it was made ! The 80s allowed it to be a masterpiece ! The special effects are spectacular and I still think they are as good as the ones used currently ! I like the actors and the characters they play ! Fisher Stevens is hilarious ! John Stockwell played his part very good . Danielle von Zerneck and Raphael Sbarge put on good performances ! I really liked Richard Masur in the movie . His character Detective Jack Nulty was really a bad @ $$ and a ruthless one at that ! His accent and attitude was just so cool ! I always like to see Barry Corbin in the movie . Dennis Hopper's character Bob Roberts was colorful and intelligent ! This may sound strange but I believe My Science Project could be arguably his best movie ! The laughing bum character was funny ! Look for RoboCop's Robert DoQui and Big Trouble In Little China's Al Leong ! The budget of the film is big and I have always liked what it has in store ! Another thing I love about My Science Project is the score by Peter Bernstein ! The music fits the film perfectly and the theme it has is just phenomenally spooky ! Its so great ! In My opinion This movie has very good acting by the talented actors , a cool story , spectacular effects , a wonderful 80s feel , and just about anything that you could put in a movie ! I don't know why this classic movie hasn't received the attention it deserves I mean with all of the things it has I would think this movie would be considered one of the greats but sadly that hasn't happened . I personally think My Science Project is a classic movie that I believe is one of greatest of all time ! It is always great to watch . If anyone reads this and hasn't seen My Science Project before then I strongly recommend you go rent it and then buy it ! Its a true classic !
517312	1132073	32926	10.0	Good one !	When this show was on I watched it every time I could ! I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities .

516611	1132073	143145	10.0	The Latest James Bond film is a good one !	The World is Not Enough is a good Bond film as it has lots of action like it prequels . The villain ( s ) are good this time around . Pierce Brosnan is good as always Bond , James Bond and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny was good . All James Bond fans should like this one . Die Another Day should be another great Bond film when it arrives in theatres November 22nd , 2002 . Notes : The theme song is a great one by Garbage . I love it when she says The World Is Not Enough . Its just perfect for a 007 film ! The video features a special look at Desmond Llewelyn as the James Bond 007 character Q . It is a sad feature indeed .
517261	1132073	39188	10.0	Great classic !	An amazing little adventure is the film Bill and Coo ! In this underrated classic you see so many birds doing so many things its unbelievable ! Its really incredible seeing these little animals do all of these activities . There are many different kinds of species of birds here like the Ravens and Parakeets and among many other kinds . What is really good about this little film is that each bird has a character ! The little guys are just adorable nd so cute in My opinion . If you like to see movies that focus on animals that do all kinds of thing that'll make you laugh and would love to see a film that doesn't even touch CGI then I strongly recommend that you watch this classic today !
517130	1132073	118460	10.0	This version does the book justice !	In My opinion this is the real Shining movie ! Don't get Me wrong , Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a somewhat spooky movie but its no where near the book and if you want an almost exact duplicate version of Stephen King's The Shining this mini series is it ! One big note is it has the animal hedges in it which Kubrick's film really lacked . The film focuses on the boy and his shining which the other version did not ! Is all the other version focused on was an excellent performance Jack Nicholson . In My opinion Steven Weber actually played the father quite well and Rebecca De Mornay was very good and looked great ! Melvin Van Peebles was good and he fitted the character more than Scatman Crothers in My opinion . If you have read the book on the Shining and haven't seen either film do see both but see Kubrick's for Jack's performance but see Stephen King's The Shining Mini series for the real thing but if you haven't read it and seen neither of them then see both and compare them . I really liked the mini series a lot better and I think you will too !
516757	1132073	95311	10.0	Hit List is a awesome movie !	Hit List is a great 80s action film that has an all star cast ! Jan-Michael Vincent was good , Leo Rossi played his role good ! Lance Henriksen was incredible ! Charles Napier was good as always ! Rip Torn was awesome as He reminded Me of Jack Nicholson ! The movie Hit List is a dang good one ! It is one of those special movies of the 1980s ! It has a ton of action through out the film and it has a very aggressive approach toward violence ! The story is good , the cast is excellent , the acting is great , the action is totally superb , the music is unique , and the entire film is special ! I strongly recommend this film !
516597	1132073	43472	10.0	Great Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! A good Three Stooges short with Shemp ! Dick Curtis and Jean Willes performed really good together as a couple . The scenes when The Stooges do their census stuff in the hall is funny . The short has some really funny scenes especially the mirror scenes . Also the scenes when Dick Curtis is doing his stuff is also really good . I recommend this Three Stooges Short !
516697	1132073	33565	10.0	Great Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made .

The entire thing is extremely hilarious ! The scene where Curly performs music in the radio and the restaurant scene is great and when the Stooges come out of the building dressed as high officers are so funny ! Bud Jamison as usual puts on a great performance ! This is a super funny Three Stooges short !
517725	1132073	239395	10.0	Cats and Dogs !	Cats and Dogs is a great comedy action film that stars Jeff Goldblum , Elizabeth Perkins , Alexander Pollock , Miriam Margolyes , Tobey Maguire , Alec Baldwin , Sean Hayes , Susan Sarandon , Michael Clarke Duncan , Jon Lovitz , Joe Pantoliano , and Charlton Heston ! There are several hilarious moments in this picture . The action scenes are done very well . Goldblum and the other actors were . The castle scenes were really cool . The music by John Debney is very good . The movie is totally funny . I thought it was something else seeing all those different types of dogs and cats . So if you who like Jeff Goldblum and the rest of the cast mentioned and comedies with animals then I strongly recommend this film !
516927	1132073	53085	10.0	Great Mummy movie !	This Mummy film is very good ! Perter Cushing and Christopher Lee are excellent in the film ! Also Eddie Byrne was good . All of the other actors were fine . I like the great color and music in this mummy film as well ! Christopher Lee is awesome in the picture ! His walking is very neat ! I think he did a great job ! I thought the designs of his character ( past and present ) looked great and fixed up nicely too ! In his mummy form his eyes look scary ! This is one of the best mummy films to watch in My opinion ! If you like the cast members above , mummy movies , and horror then I strongly recommended this ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you love mummy films I recommend the following : The Mummy ( 1932 ) , The Monster Squad ( 1987 ) The Mummy Lives ( 1993 ) , Tale of the Mummy ( 1998 ) , The MuMmy ( 1999 ) The MuMmy Returns ( 2001 ) , The Scorpion King ( 2002 ) , and The MuMmy : The Animated Series ( 2001 ) !
516856	1132073	102510	10.0	A good sequel that is as funny as the original in My opinion !	The sequel is very funny ! All of the returning cast is great but Robert Goulet's villain is great ! Anthony James was good and it was sad to see Gina Mastrogiacomo . Look for some familiar faces too ! This is a great funny movie is arguably funnier that the first one ! If you like silly and funny films and like the Naked gun first film or the series then check this good sequel out !
516702	1132073	358294	10.0	Great Steven Seagal film ! One of his best to come out in a long time ! Excellent sword Fighting !	Into the Sun , Steven Seagal's latest movie ! The film has excellent action and Steven Seagal is very good in the film . It has a different story . Like some of his recent movies it takes place in other countries . It has a whole bunch of action including great sword fight scenes , major violence , blood , and there is a few of shoot outs . So if you are fan that loves sword fighting the ends in results of blood and decapitations that seem almost endless and if you think movies don't have that sort of thing anymore then Into the Sun has plenty of it ! There is a huge sword fight and the end ! The film has a great score by Stanley Clarke ! The bad guys are interesting villains . They are some that makes you hate them and believe Me Seagal get's ' em ! The movie is not bad at all , in fact its on of the best Seagal films to out in a long time ! If you love Steven Seagal then check Into the Sun ! ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies ! Above the Law , Hard to Kill , Marked for Death ( Must see because it great ! ) , Out for Justice ( Great ! ) , Under Siege , On Deadly Ground ( Really good ! ) , Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory ( Very good ! ) , The Glimmer Man ( In My opinion his all time best and one of the greatest films ever ! ) , Fire Down Below ( Excellent ! ) , The Patriot , Ticker , The Foreigner ( Surprising great ! ) , Out for a Kill , and Belly of the Beast !
517226	1132073	219519	10.0	Great Jeff Goldblum movie !	Beyond Suspicion is a different and good movie to watch ! Jeff Goldblum , once again put on a fantastic performance ! The story is really good . The movie is made pretty good and in My opinion it seemed similar like a Alfred Hitchcock movie ! The music by Mark Mancina is very good ! If you like Jeff Goldblum , rent this must see movie !
517424	1132073	107290	10.0	The One that started it all !	This film is great ! Its sequels are great but this is the one that started it all ! Sam Niel , Laura Dern , Jeff Goldblum , and Richard Attenborough played there parts very well ! The Dinosaurs are incredible and I couldn't believe it the first time I saw it ! If you like Dinosaurs then heck out Jurassic Park !
517277	1132073	98193	10.0	Great sequel !	This is my favorite of the series . Unlike the first one this is more of a super hero film . This movie is very good and it delivers ! Louis Jourdan is great and Dick Durock performs as Swamp Thing in my opinion a lot better than hie did in the original . Sarah Douglas is so neat and so beautiful ! I don't think she has looked any better and her performance is very good . Heather Locklear was good and looked great as always . Ace Mask was funny . The monster and action battles are very good . If you haven't seen any Swamp Thing film do see the original fist but I recommend seeing this one more . I'm sure it'll be your favorite of the two .
517408	1132073	65687	10.0	Elvis : That's the Way It Is !	Elvis : That's the Way It Is ! If anybody wanted to watch a special feature documentary on Elvis then this is it ! You see the things he and his band do before they perform in front in thousands of screaming fans ! In this you get to see Elvis do his incredible movements , him risking his life getting kissed by the women fans and getting in the crowd . There are many songs in this event . It is amazing has how this is a spectacular documentary / concert . The King is something else here . His performance is incredible and hilarious ! If you love Elvis then I strongly recommend that you watch this ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : The following notes contain some special info and the rest is My thoughts . There was a special program many years ago called The Elvis Files . It was a two program hosted by the late great Bill Bixby . The show was live and it showed the evidence that he is still alive . Many years ago there was an edition of Sally Jessy Raphael and it had several guests there including Elvis ' stepbrother , cousin , and friend Charlie Hodge . All three were against that he is alive . Elvis was a very unique man . He was one of the greatest singers and performers the world had ever seen . He was a very serious individual . He was kind , he could have fun , he could be silly but there was really a mystery to this man . What I am about to say here is all in My opinion and is My thoughts . Do I believe that his is alive ? Since I believe in just about anything I really can't say that he is or he is not . I do know this however that there is something fishy going on and it has been like that ever since . If he is no longer with us then how do you explain the photo is Graceland ? The telephone calls that sounded exactly like him ? How do you explain all of the sightings ? Sure the most simple thing to say is that they saw impersonators and people that simply resemble him but the people that say they saw him would swear that it was really him . You can believe what you want to but like most mysteries in the world this mystery of Elvis Presley has yet to be solved . Thanks for reading !
516758	1132073	95889	10.0	Poltergeist III !	The third and final film in the Poltergeist series is a good sequel in My opinion ! The Poltergeist curse as it is called by some makes the films sad but the series is very entertaining and spooky ! I would say this third one is the least scary but it has it moments ! Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen were really good as Heather O'Rourke's Uncle and Aunt . Zelda Rubenstein was good like before ! Nathan Davis played Kane well but some may think he isn't as scary as Julian Beck's Kane which in My opinion Beck's Kane was so evil and creepy but there is nothing wrong with Davis ' Kane either ! The music is very good . I think Poltergeist III is a good film just different than the prequels . If you have seen the other two Poltergeist movies then I recommend you see the third one for a good scary time ! Movie Nuttball's Note : This is strictly My opinion . I believe that the deaths of the actors that performed in the Poltergeist movie did have something to do with the films but what I don't know . I think the movies where deep in stories as they were different than others and why the things that happened to few actors that died I don't know either . As great as this series is maybe they should have skipped the trilogy ? I can't say for sure . May Heather O'Rourke , Will Sampson , Julian Beck , and Dominique Dunne Rest in Peace !
517691	1132073	100502	10.0	Good sequel to RoboCop !	The Sequel to RoboCop is a good one with more violence . Perter Weller and Nancy Allen both do as good Dan O'Herlihy , as they did in the original . Thomas Rosales Jr once again gets shot up in this movie which was no suprise to Me because in most of the films he is in he either gets killed or is behind bars . Tom Noonan is the villain this time around and is a good one at that ! John Glover is his usual self . Leonard Rosenman's score for RoboCop 2 is very good ! Fans of the first RoboCop film check the sequel out as it is a good sequel with a lot of action !
517354	1132073	47460	10.0	Scotched in Scotland !	I like this one and this is one of My favorite ones with the Three Stooges ! I think Christine McIntyre was as good always ! All of the actors were good which included Philip Van Zandt , Herbert Evans , Charles Knight , Jimmy Logan , Theodore Lorch , and George Pembroke ! I like the spooky theme of this one like some of the Three Stooges shorts ! It has a good mystery to it ! The Stooges especially Moe are hilarious in Hot Scots ! One of the funniest parts in the short is when Moe and Christine McIntyre were dancing and she was giving the Earl's treasures to Theodore Lorch in disguise ! One other part in it is when the Stooges introduce themselves to the Earl and Shemp is getting knocked on the head by Moe's cane ! The Stooges Hot Scots is a hilarious spooky Three Stooges Short ! Like some other spooky type Three Stooges shorts this is a great Three Stooges short to watch over again around Halloween time !
517697	1132073	245562	10.0	One of the greatest war films with the most realistic action ever !	Minor SpoilersThis is one of the greatest war films of all time and it deserves awards in my opinion ! Most people may not think this but Nicolas and Adam Beach deserves best actor and supporting actor awards in my opinion . Christian Slater was good but his role was reduced and its a shame that Jason Isaacs was in Windtalkers just for one scene because he has a great volume of potential and I feel he should have had a much bigger role . James Horner's score was good and the directing by John Woo was excellent . Windtalkers is one of the most realistic war film I have ever scene and the scenes with the planes is beautifully stunning ! I recommend this film to all war and action film fans alike !
517114	1132073	37812	10.0	Great Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a really a classic Three Stooges short . Vernon Dent is very good as the Judge . Paul Kruger , Eddie Laughton , and Al Thompson are in this one . I like the great acting by the Stooges especially by Moe . When Curly and Larry are in the car the communication between the two was really good . I recommend this one !
516836	1132073	85390	10.0	Another great Looney Tunes film !	I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do ! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today !
517681	1132073	183649	10.0	Great movie ! A must see !	The Phone Booth is a very clever and unusual movie . Decent acting from the cast including a great performance from Colin Farrell ! Forest Whitaker was very good . Kiefer Sutherland was excellent ! The performances from Radha Mitchell , Katie Holmes , and Paula Jai Parker were good . I like how the film had the Hulk like split screens . I also like that fact that it focused on the victim and the killer almost the entire hour and twenty-one minutes ! The end is just unbelievable ! Joel Schumacher is a very good director in My opinion and this movie deserves a lot of attention in My opinion . If you want a short film that keeps you going until the end and an ending that is very surprising then check out the Phone Booth !
517024	1132073	79227	10.0	Good Guys Wear Black !	This is pretty good movie . Chuck Norris was good . The fighting scenes were good especially the one when Norris kicks through the car window ! The war scenes near the beginning was awesome ! The music was really different . This was one of Chuck's first movies and its a good one !
516696	1132073	27152	10.0	Great Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made .

In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a great Three Stooges short and it has become one of My favorites ! Its hilarious ! Great one from beginning to end ! Bud Jamison as usual puts on a great performance ! The cake eating scene , the questioning scene with Theodore Lorch , and the end scenes are very funny . This is a very good Three Stooges short !
517168	1132073	88944	10.0	One of Arnold's best and one of the greatest action films of all time ! !	I just wanted to say that Commando in My opinion is one of Arnold's best and I like the cast . Vernon Wells is a very good actor and large man and played a very bad villain ! I really liked his character . Bill Duke is very good in the films as well . Rae Dawn Chong was good and this is probably her best film . Dan Hedaya's accent was good and sounded realistic . Chelsea Field , James Olson , David Patrick Kelly , Alyssa Milano , and Bill Paxton was good . Branscombe Richmond and Thomas Rosales Jr . was in this but had very short roles . The music is excellent by James Horner ! The violence is awesome ! This one of Arnold's most violent films and a film like this is one of the reasons why the 80s was great ! The film is really a classic and a great shoot em up film and I recommend it to all Arnold and action movie fans !
516568	1132073	42940	10.0	Good Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made .

In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! I think this Three Stooges Short with Shemp is really good . The Stooges put on very good performances as not only their characters but also their love interests ! Also Moe plays the girls ' father as well greatly . Many funny things happen here . I recommend this Three Stooges short !
517552	1132073	53344	10.0	Good flick !	Blood Creature is one of those old drive in type movies which is actually its a pretty good film . Francis Lederer and Richard Derr is in the movie and so is Greta Thyssen who was in a few of the Three Stooges shorts in the Joe Besser era . She actually has very big part in the film . This movie , Blood Creature has some very good acting in it and the storms were cools . The creature itself was neat looking which really looked like a humanoid panther mummy ! If you have seen The 1996 version of The Island of Dr . Moreau you will notice some scenes that was in that movie are very similar in this movie ! Really Blood Creature is decent little old film that has many great moments and especially if you are a a Three Stooges fan its interesting to see Greta Thyssen in a role where she is scared and screaming ! For horror and Island of Dr . Moreau fans don't miss this one !

In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a hilarious Three Stooges short in My opinion . The Stooges are so funny . Nanette Bordeaux , Vivian Mason , and Suzanne Ridgeway all perform well and they look excellent ! Stanley Blystone and Vernon Dent were good . There is another Three Stooges short with Curly very similar like this one called Healthy , Wealthy , and Dumb . I strongly recommend both !

All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Heavenly Daze ! All appearing in this short are Vernon Dent , Sam McDaniel , Symona Boniface , Judy Malcolm , Marti Shelton , and Victor Travers . There are so many funny parts here . This is a very hilarious short . There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Bedlam in Paradise and I recommend both !
517655	1132073	257044	10.0	Excellent film ! ! !	This is an excellent film ! Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great ! I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son ! That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good . I was very surprised about the end . Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks ' best !
517186	1132073	96344	10.0	Great 80s horror movie !	I am not sure if there is two versions of the film but I want to say that the original uncut version is good . Though I could do with out the nudity but for horror fans this is a great one to see with a awesome female monster ! The truth is I actually felt sorry for her at the end . Great 80s horror film that is scary and should satisfy most horror fans !
517355	1132073	49104	10.0	Great one !	This is on of the spookiest and funniest Three Stooges shorts ! It begins rather well with thunders storms and the howling wind ! When the Stooges discover that the armor talks and they have a conversation about who he is its gets really good after that ! I think I was funny when the Stooges opened that chest and the skeleton came out and he says that he's Red and Shemp says Red Skeleton ! I thought that was very funny ! There is a lot of other type of spooky stuff in this one and also another funny part in it is when Larry talks to the suit of armor he say to " well maybe he doesn't talk English " and then he say things in other languages and the suit of armor replies to it and Larry's hat spins around and he is very frightened ! I thought it was funny ! Like some other spooky type Three Stooges shorts this is a great Three Stooges short to watch over again around Halloween time !

517637	1132073	426843	10.0	The 1998 MLB All-Star Game !	One of the most exciting and arguably the greatest Major League Baseball All-Star games was the 1998 edition . There were many surprising moments in this game and every second of it in My opinion was exciting ! So many great players were chosen in this game . Including Andres Galarraga , Mark McGwire , Larry Walker , Dante Bichette , Vinny Castilla , A-Rod , Chipper Jones , Paul O'Neil , and so many other greats ! One of the many things I like about the All-Star game is that the viewer gets to see some of the greatest MLB players the sport has to offer that some states in America and even other countries don't get the chance to watch . It always seems that the American League has the upper hand but I for one will never count out the National League . I am a huge Baseball fan and just love everything about the sport ! When the first moment on Joe Buck and company broadcast the game you know its gonna be an epic event ! If you are a Baseball fan and are able to watch this game on TV or even on tape do so because its a classic ! I recommend it !
516481	1132073	118956	10.0	Deep Rising is a excelent sea monster film with some neat bad guys , lot of action , and more !	Minor SpoilersThis sea monster action horror fest isn't to be missed ! I'M sure you know the storyline so I will comment on the action and and the monster . The action is pretty good and it has decent effects . Now for the monster , it is pretty impressive when it comes to it's looks and it is really dangerous and it has one heck of a roar ! This movie has good acting and the gore factor is high plus it has great music by Jerry Goldsmith ! There hasn't been too many sea creature movies and especialy like this ! I just hope there will be a sequel too this movie , I gotta know that that was at the end : )

Petter Greene was very good and played a good villain like he always does ! Amy Yasbeck and Nancy Fish were good . Cameron Diaz was good in her debut and I would liked it if she kept on to this day looking like she did in film . The film is very good and it has some great scenes and boasts some of the funniest things ever and I don't spoil it for you so if you like the cast I mentioned and really silly stuff and a very entertaining movie then watch the Mask !
517759	1132073	155478	10.0	Africa's Elephant Kingdom !	This is a very good Documentary with good narration by Avery Brooks . I think that all of the filming of the wonderful animals is really great . I knew some things about the African Elephant but by watching this video I learned a whole lot more ! I did not know how smart Elephants are . One of the things I thought was remarkable was when two males fight for the female they go into a fight and the thing is they actually know that the are going to get hurt or even die in the battle . Another thing is how the Elephants stay together as family . The video clips of the leader Elephant charging when threatened was really awesome ! This video in so interesting , sad , great , entertaining , funny , and exciting all at the same time . There is some death in this feature but it is not by man . If you love Elephants and want to see how intelligent these creatures are and the cute as well as the great things they do in the wild then I strongly recommend you watch this today because I don't think you can watch anything more informal ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : I love most animals in the world and I dislike people harming animals and the poachers killing innocent creatures . One day I would like man to be the hunted . This is just how I feel . Thank you for reading !
517336	1132073	114393	10.0	Serial Killer !	Serial Killer is a decent movie ! It keeps you going and I like how isn't a mystery and lets the killer be known plus it gives him a lot of time to do the things he does ! Anyway the cast is good and while I am really not familiar with Tobin Bell , he was very good as the serial killer ! Good music and story ! Recommended !

517358	1132073	46162	10.0	Pardon My Backfire !	On a local Television station I saw this funny Three Stooges in true 3D ! There was another one in 3D called Spooks ! Pardon My Backfire was really already in 3D like when Moe would do his stuff like throwing something or when one of the gangsters did something it would come right into the screen ! What I mean by true 3D is that it had the color like the famous colors ! It was a cool experience ! The Three Stooges short is pretty good ! It has a couple brutal scenes like the wire going through Larry's nose and ear and he must pull it out and like when Moe's behind is one fire ! The actors that played the gangsters are cool which they have played other parts in other Three Stooges shorts ! Like other Three Stooges shorts , the Stooges have girl friends . Like the other 3D short , this too has the different introduction with the stooges doing it live instead of the usual intro ! With the 3D experience or without it Pardon My Backfire is funny one to watch !
517104	1132073	161081	10.0	A great spooky movie with a great cast !	What Lies Beneath is arguably Robert Zemeckis ' best film next to the Back to the Future Trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit which are some of My favorite films . Harrison Ford plays such a different role compared to his Han Solo and Indiana Jones characters but he played it well . He still looks good no doubt and Michelle Pfeiffer's role is good and she played it good and she looks excellent ! James Remar was good and looked different but I feel there could have been more done with his role as he wasn't give a good much time but he acted good nonetheless . Same thing goes for Joe Morton . Alan Silvestri's score is chilling , spooky , and he composed a great , great theme . Fans of Ford , Pfeiffer , Remar , Zemeckis , or Psycho should love What Lies Beneath !
517739	1132073	26878	10.0	Good Three Stooges short ! Hilarious !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of the most hilarious Three Stooges shorts is Pop goes the Easel . In this short are Bobby Burns , Phyllis Crane , Lew Davis , Jack Duffy , Phyllis Fine , Joan Howard , William Irving , Leo White , Geneva Mitchell , and Al Thompson . The acting by these actors are good especially by Dent , and Schindell . There are many funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love ! In My opinion this one of the most different Three Stooges shorts . I recommend this one to all !
