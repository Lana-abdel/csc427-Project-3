517179	1132073	172669	1.0	Very disappointing monster flick : (	This film had some big potential but when the monsters , the giant komodo dragons don't do anything except for some dumb stunts and get hurt and / or killed which this was very disappointing for Me as I was expecting a much better film . If you like monster films and like to see giant animals and / or monster kill people then don't see this film because it doesn't happen : ( Avoid it if you don't want to waste your time and money .
516884	1132073	438323	1.0	A disappointment : (	The Flight of the Phoenix remake DVD has a nice bonus under the Special Features menu . A short Documentary called Phoenix Diaries ! Dennis Quaid , Miranda Otto , Giovanni Ribisi , Tyrese , and more make appearances in this forty-minute plus feature . This is a behind the scenes look at the film and stuff . I don't think that this one was an enjoyable as it could it have been . Why ? I will tell you ! Its all because of John Moore . Is it actually necessary to get all hyper and yelling like that ? Was it necessary to say the ' F ' word dozens of times in front of the camera while being interviewed ? I don't think so ! Who the heck does he think he is ? I sure wouldn't want to be in his one of his films especially since he threatens to kill you if you do something wrong . I mean if that is his way of joking he can lose it right now because its not funny ! As you can tell I don't like his personality . It is so unneeded to be like that ! A couple of the other actors even the ' F ' word but I think it because being around him . So I thought that I would warn you viewers if 1 . Foul language and unneeded fit throwing is not your game , 2 . If you wanted to see a pleasant making of the film because this isn't , 3 . If you have young children interested in watching documentaries . I hope that this has been helpful , Thanks for reading !
517505	1132073	196114	2.0	Disappointing film but Michael Paré's performance was great !	May contain spoilers but its important for the viewer to know . This movie , In the Dead of Space or Space Fury was a total mess ! Instead of doing it the usual way of explaining I'll do it this way ! The Good : The special effects were surprisingly good . The music was also good . The actors were good . Michael Paré put on one heck of a performance which was so chaotic I laughed at him ! He was really good performing the knife tactics . There was some action . The Bad : I didn't understand the movie at all . Its confusing because this is going on , that's going on etc . There was no explanation how Paré's character became such a great knife fighter like a Green Beret or something . Same thing for Lisa Bingley's character . She acts so sad and such and then when its time to fight Paré she becomes a great martial artist and can beat him up every time ! Her character was like several types of people in one . What was the deal with her and her boyfriend ? She is in bed with him and does the love stuff with her top and stuff on and then he gets killed and then when she goes to bed she's topless ? That didn't make sense at all and on top of that the other guy is supposed to be a superstar of some kind . If his character was really a celebrity wouldn't it be helpful to tell what he is ? Why in the world was Paré's character brainwashed in the first place ? You mean its perfectly all right to let a psycho be part of a crew in a space station ? I could go on and on about this movie . Really in My opinion the film had major potential but it failed . I only recommend anyone to watch this movie if they are a big fan Michael Paré otherwise watch something else instead !
516855	1132073	181689	3.0	The Minority Report is such big disappointment : (	Contains disgusting SpoilersThe following is My opinions and Mine only ! When I saw this film I couldn't believe it . Right then and there from the beginning I knew it was going to be a very , very different film . Don't get Me wrong here , I love futuristic films and I . Have seen plenty of them but this film here went way out of line in My opinion . I can't believe that the great Steven Spielberg directed this . Sue he did a nice job and John Williams score was neat but this film just is too much . I said out loud that's so stupid when this dumb scene appeared and that one scene I'm talking about is when Tom Cruise just got those eye implants several hours later he is at that door and he must use his old eyes via take them out of the bag and scan them or one of them to enter . Next thing you know he drops them and you hear the old squishing sound of them being dropped and we have the pleasure seeing them roll on down the floor and he runs after them and one falls into the sewer and he catches the one by the socket ! Yes , I say again he grabbed it by the socket ! How disgusting can you be ? I want to know how this neat looking but dumb film got on the IMDb top 250 : # 131 ? Max Von Sydow is a great actor and he is one of the best actors ever but his talents are wasted here . Sure the role he played was good and he played it well what he was given but even he couldn't save this film . Again I can't believe Spielberg was a part of this . HE could have made another Indiana Jones or something I mean lets face it people wouldn't you want to see another Indiana Jones film instead of the garbage that is the Manurety Report ? Just because the film is directed by Spielberg doesn't make it a good film . If haven't seen it yet then please don't see it but if you do see it expect a hard to follow story / plot and stupid things to happen . Avoid it and see something else that Spielberg did right like any of the Indiana Jones films or Jaws to name a couple ! Once again I expected a good film out of this and am so disappointed that I got to see Tom Cruise chasing his own eyes ! That's what I always wanted to see ! NOT ! ! !
517668	1132073	306063	4.0	I wasn't happy with Severed	This is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue . Its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand . The only star in this is WCW's Vanessa Sanchez ( Tygres in WCW before it folded ) and she is a good actress . I like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but Severed unfourtunatly isn't one of them . This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed .
517837	1132073	254871	5.0	Wishmaster 3 !	The Wishmaster series is a very different series . In this Wishmaster Andrew Divoff is gone as the the Djinn though the new plays the character well . The film in My opinion isn't as good as the first one but it is gory but its a film for horror fans ! . If you like Michael Myers , Freddy , and Jason , then you'll love the Djinn , the Wishmaster !
517349	1132073	327137	6.0	Secondhand Lions !	Secondhand Lions is a family type film that stars Michael Caine and Robert Duvall ! Their acting was good especially by Duvall but I think their roles didn't allow them to do much . It just seemed like they were there only to say a few words and that was it . I think when Caine's character was telling the story and you saw all of those action scenes didn't fit in . Hey I love action in movies but in this film's case I think the movie would have been much better if those scenes were not in it . Also like the two main stars the rest of the cast could only do what they given . To be honest the best part in the film is whenever the animals are screen . The music was fine . Now on to the subject of recommending this film . I don't recommend it for fans who want to see an action film unless you want to see some action that doesn't fit in the film . However I do recommended it if you want to see a family film with some cute animals , some action , and stuff . I also recommend Secondhand Lions if you like Michael Caine and Robert Duvall . All of this is My opinion . Thanks !
517560	1132073	97504	8.0	A different movie that has the late great Chuck Connors !	The film is very different and good at the same time . Chuck Connors was great . Marc Singer was good and I thought he looked a lot like Kevin Bacon in the film . This movie looked at a different way of aliens . If you like Chuck Connors and strange films about aliens then see High Desert Kill !
517609	1132073	295427	8.0	The Master of Disguise !	The Master of Disguise is a fair comedy film that has a good cast which includes Dana Carvey , Brent Spiner , Jennifer Esposito , Harold Gould , James Brolin , with Erick Avari , Jessica Simpson , Bo Derek , Paula Abdul , and Jesse Ventura ! The acting by all of these actors is very good . Carvey is really excellent in this film . I thought that he had an excellent performance ! Gould and Spiner also have good performances ! The comedy is really good . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good as well . The film is quite funny and some of the stuff is just so hilarious . Currently this film has 2 . 8 at 10 stars and is at the bottom 100 : # 57 . In My opinion this movie doesn't deserve it because its just plain silly and there isn't many films like this one . This is a fair film . If you like Dana Carvey , Brent Spiner , Jennifer Esposito , Harold Gould , James Brolin , the rest of the cast in the film , Comedies , and Action then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
517728	1132073	80391	8.0	The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes !	The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is one of the most silliest comedies ever in My opinion ! The acting by all of the movie's actors is really something . The noises the Killer Tomatoes make is so funny and it really gives them personalities . The action scenes when the Killer Tomatoes attack are extremely hilarious as well ! The film is very silly and its hilarious and the singing music by is outrageous . Its funny that the people on the front of the box of the movie isn't even in the film . This really is one of the most unusual comedy film and if you like low budget films that are so bad their good and hilarious then I Strongly recommend this film !
517782	1132073	365677	8.0	Red Water !	The movie called Red Water is yet another shark film but it takes things in a different direction . It stars Lou Diamond Phillips , Kristy Swanson , and Coolio . The actors were good in the film and well in My opinion Lou Diamond is always good but Coolio had long part in the film and I found him quite funny believe it or not . The shark looks good but there isn't as much gore in the film compared to other shark films so gore fans maybe disappointed . The music is good and fits the film OK . The movie is OK and will give the viewer something interesting watch . If you want to see a shark movie that stars Lou Diamond Phillips , Kristy Swanson , and Coolio then watch Red Water today ! Movie Nuttball's Note : If you like shark films then I recommend you also see Jaws and Deep Blue Sea !
517783	1132073	286108	9.0	Good Movie !	Dead Silence is a good film with good actors and acting ! The two good performances to talk about are by Vladimir Kulich and Bruce Boxleitner ! Vladimir was really the ultimate villain in this film . I think he could be awesome as other types of bad guys in movies if he is given the chance . Boxleitner also put on a good performance . Kristy Swanson and Vincent Spano were good and one of the kings of horror Tony Todd also was good and actually the acting by the girl was pretty good . The film is handled in a different way . I thought It was unusual and different that this film was filmed in Kansas City , Missouri . Overall I think Dead Silent is fair film and if you are a fan that likes the actors that I mentioned above and want to see them is different film then I recommend that you watch this movie !
517362	1132073	113360	9.0	Great movie ! Christopher Lambert and John Lone are great in the Hunted !	This film is great ! Christopher Lambert is good and John Lone was very good .

517276	1132073	84745	9.0	Its a good film .	The first Swamp Thing is an ok film but I really recommend the sequel more . Why ? Because the first has action but to me its just a normalmonster film that is sad where the sequel ( The Return of Swamp Thing ) is more of a action / super hero film . Adrienne Barbeau is as beautiful as ever and Louis Jourdan and Dick Durock are good but I like their performances better in the sequel . Of course this Swamp Thing is good in many ways for example : the ending but I just like the sequel a lot more .
516992	1132073	94886	9.0	Good horror movie !	This film is very good . Look for a very young Sam Rockwell . The film is scary whether you like clowns are not . I don't think the new viewer will be bored because its an interesting film and a different one at that so if you got time check Clownhouse out !
516503	1132073	116705	10.0	Jingle All The Way !	One of the most hilarious film of all time in My opinion is Jingle All The Way ! It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sinbad , Phil Hartman , Rita Wilson , Robert Conrad , Martin Mull , Jake Lloyd , James Belushi , Paul Wight , and Richard Moll . Arnold is very good in this film and he is funny . Sinbad is hilarious in this film . I amazed how big Sinbad is when he stands next to Arnold . Hartman is very good in this film too and he shows that he really was a quality actor . The wrestler Paul Wight who is a huge man also performed good . The action is really great and a lot of the scenes are really cool ! The dialog is really smart in this movie . The music by David Newman is good . I really like this film and I think its one of the best ! If you love Arnold and the other cast members and love Christmas action comedy films then I strongly recommend Jingle All The Way today ! Movie Nuttball's NOTES : Here are some other Arnold recommendations : Conan the Barbarian , Conan the Destroyer , Red Sonja , The Terminator , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , Terminator 3 : The Rise of the Machines , The Running Man , Raw Deal , Commando , Predator , Total Recall , Kindergarten Cop , Last Action Hero , True Lies , Junior , Eraser , Batman and Robin , End of Days , and Collateral Damage !

517878	1132073	118615	10.0	Great movie ! Jon Voight is excellent !	This film , Anaconda is a very good film in My opinion . The cast is different and they all acted well which this cast includes Jon Voight , Eric Stoltz , Jennifer Lopez , Ice Cube , Jonathan Hyde , Owen Wilson , and Kari Wuhrer . As I said all of the actors are good but Voight's Paul Sarone is one of the coolest and meanest I have ever seen and he is one of My favorite villains in a movie . Those looks he gets on his face are something else ! He is enough to scare a super hero ! I think that this is Voight's best role ! The music by Randy Edelman is in My opinion one of the best musical scores for a movie . The snakes look very realistic and the directing by Luis Llosa is very good . I have always like this film because of its great acting by Jon Voight , the special effects , great musical score , and lots of excitement ! If you like Jon Voight , J . Lo , giant snake movies then I strongly recommend Anaconda !

Both movies are very unpredictable and very scary and both films follow right after the other and both main cast in The Fly / Fly II have love interests ( Fly I , Goldblum and Davis , Fly II , Stotlz and Zuniga ) which is pretty cool . All in all The Fly series is a fantastic series of the 80s ( which was a great decade I might add ) . In MY opinion there will never be movies like this again , they are classics , a real thrilling horror series . When the last time you got scared of a movie ? ? ? Heres a tip : DON'T WATCH THEM IN THE DARK ! ! ! The Fly part 2 has a great beginning much like its predecessor with a great promo . You get to know Seth's ( Goldblum in Fly 1 ) son Martin ( Stoltz ) as he goes on with life much faster than everyone else . You feel sorry for him as well much like Goldblum in the first movie . You also feel sorry for Beth ( Zuniga ) as she trys to help martin . Yes its true Strathis ( Getz ) reprises his roleThere are lots of doctors and security guards you just hate because of what they do to martin . Once martin evolves into the Fly , all hell breaks loose . You never know what is going to happen next . This is really one heck of monster movie and you won't believe what you'll see ! By the way , listen to music score by Christopher Young , it really makes this movie even better . When you here the main title theme you think holytoledo , this is really gonna be good and you know what ? It is , I suggest you buy buy the score , you'll love it ! The film is great , like the other a bit sad but very good . The Fly II is an excellent horror movie ! The acting by Eric Stoltz was really good ! The part with the dog was sad but you can tell its animatronic . The real horror begins when Martin discovers the camera in his room ! His transformation is really gruesome . I think the fly monster is one of the most terrifying monsters ever ! I just love the score by Christopher Young ! The music is beautiful , dark , and aggressive ! My favorite part is the main titles ! It is one of the greatest songs ever composed in My opinion ! I liked in the main title how the credit says the Fly II in nice and bright blue letters ! The Fly II is My favorite of the Fly movies and even though Jeff Goldblum acted superbly in the first , the sequel has some big time moments ! Speaking of Goldblum , he has two archive footage scenes in the film ! Some of today's horror movie are very good but there hasn't been a movie like the Fly II since it came out . In My opinion , if your looking for a great horror movie then this is it ! Horror movies just ain't made like this often ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : As you know I love the music and in fact I adore the score to the Fly II ! There is a special edition CD of the score . It contains the score of the Fly and the Fly II ! If you are a fan of the scores I recommend that you get it ! It is well worth the buy !
517246	1132073	301470	10.0	Jeepers Creepers II ! An excellent sequel !	Jeepers Creepers 2 is one heck of a horror movie ! I love the first one and this was a must see ! The sequel did not disappoint Me at all ! Ray Wise had a very good performance ! Jonathan Breck was excellent as the Creeper ! The Creeper is such an unusual character / monster ! There is much we know about him but then there's so much more we don't know about him ! The Creeper has such a raw but interesting personality ! I really liked the chemistry Diane Delano , Thom Gossom Jr . , and Tom Tarantini had together ! When they are on screen it makes the movie really good ! I like the attention to the sky when the Creeper would fly ! It was so neat seeing the stars and the moon ! That radio report was something else ! I really liked how they talked about the burned church as it helps the movie tell what happened in the first ! A very clever idea ! The music by Bennett Salvay is excellent once again ! There are some scary and surprising moments in this film and you don't know who the Creeper will get next ! In My opinion there are some original and bizarre scenes and like him or not Victor Salva did an excellent job at directing this motion picture ! I hope there will be a third film ! If you liked the first one and have not seen this one or if you haven't seen the prequel and are thinking about seeing both movies then I recommend you see the first and then the second ! I strongly recommend Jeepers Creepers and Jeepers Creepers II !
517258	1132073	32917	10.0	Excellent Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Curly is A Plumbing We Will Go ! All appearing in this short are Symona Boniface , Monte Collins , Dudley Dickerson , Bess Flowers , Bud Jamison , Eddie Laughton , John Tyrrell ! There are so many funny parts here and the scenes with Bud Jamison are is really cool . There are two other Three Stooges shorts with Shemp very similar like this one called Vagabond Loafers and Scheming Schemers . A Plumbing We Will Go is a very hilarious short and I recommend it !
517846	1132073	231138	10.0	Great Mummy flick ! ! ! ! !	This is really a good Mummy movie . I admit that when I looked at the back of the box I didn't know what to think but being a huge fan of Mummy movies I had to rent it and I am glad I did . Ofcourse this is not like the Mummy with Brendan Frazier because it isn't suposse to be . This is the first or one of the first Mummy flicks I can recall about a Aztec Mummy . You get really use to this movie because the guys stay in one place and doesn't jump from city to city like other movies . I like films amd horror films that focus on in one place . As for the Mummy himself , he really isn't a bad looking mummy , he carrys his sacred stabbing weapon and as for the gore there really isn't any at all and the acting isn't bad either by the youngsters . In My opinion this movie is presented like a old late 30s , 40S flick , especialy the begaining of the movie when the credits are shown . Overall I like this movie . Here is a tip , when you watch the movie listen as close as you can to the music , the music I love and it fits perfectly , it is composed by new compposer Jared DePasquale . By listening to this you may want more of his music , I know I did .
517206	1132073	120587	10.0	One of the greatest animated films of all time !	This animated film by Dreamworks is very funny and is fantastic ! It has an all-star cast which includes Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone , Gene Hackman , Christopher Walken , Jennifer Lopez , Woody Allen , Anne Bancroft , Jane Curtin , and Dan Akroyd ! All of the actors play their characters well and it is something else how these actors bring such much life and personality to these wonderful characters ! I thought it was amazing that Curtin and Akroyd was a couple again ! The animation is really incredible and I was amazed by the termite wars and the ant army marching scenes ! They are so cool ! The color is really clean and crisp and not to mention very clear . The story is very good and each and every character has their own personality . The music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell is very good as well . If you love the cast mentioned above and animated films that are hilarious then I strongly recommend then you check out Ants today !
516695	1132073	178145	10.0	Very good movie !	This is a very good movie and I think that this film is very realistic how it was back then . The actress who looks almost exactly like Helen Hunt Leelee Sobieski stars as the title name and she has a powerful performance . Powers Boothe , Jonathan Hyde , Peter O'Toole , Robert Loggia , Shirley MacLaine , Maximilian Schell , Neil Patrick Harris , and Peter Strauss all put on great performances . The music in the film is very good . I think everything looks very realistic and there maybe few battles but all are good . Back to her performance , Sobieski acts very convincingly as Joan . This is a very good film that is emotional , interesting , and exciting and really shouldn't be missed by any big movie fan or fans of Gladiator and The Lord of the Rings trilogy . I strongly recommend this title !
516856	1132073	102510	10.0	A good sequel that is as funny as the original in My opinion !	The sequel is very funny ! All of the returning cast is great but Robert Goulet's villain is great ! Anthony James was good and it was sad to see Gina Mastrogiacomo . Look for some familiar faces too ! This is a great funny movie is arguably funnier that the first one ! If you like silly and funny films and like the Naked gun first film or the series then check this good sequel out !

All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a fair Three Stooges short with Shemp . The beautiful Mary Ainslee , David Bond , Vernon Dent , Jimmie Lloyd , and Ned Glass are in it . The scenes when the Stooges are getting out of bed and ready is funny . Bond is good as the hypnotist , The Great Svengarlic . There is another Three Stooges short similar like this one called Flagpole Jitters and its just as good as this one . Three Stooges fans , check this one out !
517391	1132073	87363	10.0	Gremlins !	Gremlins is a very good film though I think it is sad at times but it is funny and very entertaining ! The film's actors act good including Dick Miller , the movie's Gremlins look great and cute at the same time ! Jerry Goldsmith's music is very good ! If you like director Joe Dante and haven't seen Gremlins then I recommend you see this cute but serious film !
517389	1132073	102614	10.0	Good Steven Seagal movie !	This Steven Seagal film is a dandy ! William Forsythe really plays a good villain ! Jerry Orbach was good as well !

Van Helsing , one of My most anticipated movies and it was everything that I thought it would be and more ! I think the film is a great one ! Everyone one who is in this movie acted very good . Hugh Jackman was great as Van Helsing . He was very believable ! Kate Beckinsale also was good and her accent was cool . Richard Roxburgh was excellent and he arguably had the best performance and his look as Dracula was neat . Shuler Hensley was great as Frankenstein's Monster ! Samuel West was also great as Dr . Frankenstein and it was outstanding how much he looked like Colin Clive ! Kevin J . O'Connor was also great as Igor . Will Kemp was good as the Werewolf . The three Brides played by Elena Anaya , Silvia Colloca , and Josie Maran were excellent and they have a lot of screen time . It is amazing how they look in their vampire forms ! Robbie Coltrane was good as Mr . Hyde ! Also in good performances are Alun Armstrong and David Wenham . I just couldn't believe how great this movie is . The beginning of it is incredible ! The sound is spectacular and I can't recall a film with sound like this ! The musical score by Alan Silvestri is phenomenal ! Arguably the greatest score he has ever written and in My opinion one of the greatest scores ever ! The special effects are awesome and in My opinion everything looks real ! The directing by Stephen Sommers is great ! I think Van Helsing is one of the best movies and truly one of the most exciting films . If you like the cast mentioned above , love Sommer's The Mummy films , and want to see some incredible action involving Van Helsing , Dracula , Werewolves , Frankenstein's Monster , Mr . Hyde , Dracula's Brides , and more then I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy this excellent movie today !
516811	1132073	94012	10.0	Spaceballs is a classic !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Spaceballs is a very funny spoof film that copies off of Star Wars and some other films but every time I watch Spaceballs I always think of it as it's own film . Its that funny ! It has a good cast and believe ME Spaceballs isn't boring . Infact the entire film is a blast ! I have seen it many , many times and it gets funnier every time you see it !
517449	1132073	47577	10.0	A very good film !	Its great film ! The casting was good and Rex Reason was an excellent choice ! I don't believe there is an actor like him today . Faith Domergue is very different actress but a very beautiful at that ! The color is awesome and the Metaluna Mutant is a cool villain ! A great Universal Studios Monsters film !
517513	1132073	115857	10.0	Chain Reaction is such a good movie !	Minor SpoilersBeing part of a blockbuster movie year of 1996 , Chain Reaction seemed like it didn't get much credit . When I saw Chain Reaction at the theatre I was very xcited about the film and I loved so much I bought the video ! There's just something about Chain Reaction . It has a very good cast and I like how Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz acts in this together . I really like Rachel ! Morgan Freeman is really good and in MY opinion this is one of his best roles yet ! Brian Cox really steals the show here and Fred Ward and Kevin Dunn make a excellent team . Another thing I like about Chain Reaction is the city views , thier're spectactlar and the effects are awesome . Like I said there's just something about this movie , it's one of MY favorites !

Alone in the Dark is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Christian Slater , Tara Reid , Stephen Dorff , Frank C . Turner , Mathew Walker , Will Sanderson , Mark Acheson , Darren Shahlavi , and Karin Konoval , The acting by all of these actors is very good . Slater , Reid , and Dorff are really excellent in this film . I thought that they performed good . I thought their looks were neat as well ! I do not understand why the heck this is on the IMDb Bottom 100 # 44 ? This movie gives you everything ! I thought that this was a very cool film ! Here's what Alone in the Dark gives you ! 1 . Incredible action and fights ! 2 . Long shoot outs rarely seen nowadays in films . 3 . Awesome creatures that's scary , extremely tough to kill and rips people to shreds ! 4 . Army battles monsters and monsters destroys the army ! 5 . A great story ! So what the heck is bad about this one ? Its seems like when there is a film that is really cool and everything happens that is when you people all join together and hate it ! As for the scene between Slater and Reid there was nothing there ! Just a love scene and not what these people say it is and I saw nothing a wrong with her looks in this film ! This is all my opinion ! I mean the thrills is really good , the movie is filmed very good , the music is very good , and the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . If you haven't seen this film and if you like Christian Slater , Tara Reid , Stephen Dorff , Frank C . Turner , Mathew Walker , Will Sanderson , the rest of the cast in the film , Action , Horror , Thrillers , Adventure , Dramas , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you ignore all of the bad comments and see this film today !

There's Lethal Weapon 1 , Lethal Weapon 2 , Lethal Weapon 3 , and Lethal Weapon 4 all starring great actors Mel Gibson and Danny Glover ! Also Joe Pesci and Rene Russo are in the later editions ! Steve Kahan , Paul Tuerpe , and Mary Ellen Trainor are in all four as well . Shane Black did a great job with the writing ! I also like how the series has the same composers Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton , producer , Joel Silver , and director Richard Donner has directed all four ! Lethal Weapon 3 ! It stars Mel Gibson , Danny Glover , Joe Pesci , Rene Russo , Stuart Wilson , Sven-Ole Thorsen , Nick Chinlund , and Mark Pellegrino ! Look for Jan de Bont , Mic Rogers , and Danny Wynands !

517630	1132073	88889	10.0	Stephen King's Cat's Eye !	One of Stephen King's greatest stories in My opinion turned into a live feature film is Cat's Eye ! The film has three very interesting stories with some good actors including James Woods , Alan King , Kenneth McMillan , Robert Hays , Candy Clark , James Naughton , Drew Barrymore , Mike Starr , and Charles Dutton ! The acting by all of these actors are very good . The stories as I mention are very good and funny in a way though the film is serious . Quitter's Inc is a unique story , The Ledge is arguably the best of the lot but My favorite one is The General . I love the little demon . He is so cute and mean looking at the same time and I am amazed how real looks ! Carlo Rambaldi did an excellent job ! The music by Alan Silvestri is great ! If you like the cast mentioned above and love Stephen King then I strongly recommend Cat's Eye !
516814	1132073	159273	10.0	Great action and awesome camra work !	We just rented Behind Enemy Lines and I think it was a very good film . Pretty good acting and very intence action with just totally awesome camra work ! Gene Hackman has always been a great actor and once again he was very good but Owen Wilson's acting to ME has always been questionible and I knew this movie required a serious role for him and I didn't think he could pull it off . Wilson did pull it off and now I he can be a serious guy when he wants to . David Keith was good but I just wanted him to have a bigger role but that is really the only disappointment in this movie . This has great photographey and the end was excellent . There hasn't been a big battle scene like that in quite awhile ! I recommend any fan of , Hackman's , Wilson's , Keith's , and / or any war movie fan to see this great movie !

The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed excellently . The special effects is also great . The music by Nerida Tyson-Chew is outstanding . I recommend that you stop by Amazon . com and buy the score ! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like the cast mentioned in the film , Thrillers , Action , Horror , and interesting giant snake films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
517086	1132073	82495	10.0	Halloween 2 : Alternate ending and more ! READ BELOW ! ! !	May contain spoilers : Halloween II is a very good film sequel to Halloween . I think they should have just left it alone with Halloween 1 and 2 and just stopped from there but the other sequels are OK but the first two are the best which part 2 follows greatly after the first one and they are both classics ! Any horror and killer movie fan will enjoy Halloween 2 ! Special Notes : A long time ago we recorded an edited version of Halloween 2 on TV and it is so much different than the original version . Here are the differences in the two . This may be nothing special but I just thought I should tell Halloween hardcore fans ! MICHAEL'S FIRST KILL SCENE : My original version : When the woman next-door is talking to her friend on the phone about the older woman screaming she gets killed by Michael . My edited version : When the woman next-door is talking to her friend on the phone about the older woman screaming we never see Michael go into her house and thus never kills her . COKE SCENE : My edited version : When Jimmy asks Laurie if she wanted a Coke and she says yes and he brings it to her . My original version : When Jimmy asks Laurie if she wanted a Coke and she says yes but he never brings it to her . PHONE SCENE : My edited version : when Laurie picks up the phone she says mama , I wanna go home mama but the phone is dead but she talks anyway . My original version : when Laurie picks up the phone she just looks at it and she doesn't talk . ROOM OF BLOOD SCENE : My original version : Jimmy walks in to see the head nurse dead and he slips in a pool of her blood and hits his head hard . Later he walks in the car where Laurie is hiding but he suddenly dies . Read more about this in the alternate ending . My edited version : Jimmy never went in the room but the same exact scene was used when Michael Myers got blown up as it showed Jimmy getting caught by the explosion and hits his head . HEAD STAFF SCENE : My original version : the head nurse and the doctor are shown dead . My edited version : the head nurse and the doctor are never shown dead and is never told as you wonder what happened to them . ALTERNATE ENDING : My edited version : When Laurie gets into the ambulance a figure covered up with a sheet is on the other bed and the figure is jimmy and Laurie cries and say " we made it " several times and he smiles at her . My original version : Laurie gets into the ambulance that is taking her to a new hospital and the movie ends .
516475	1132073	102202	10.0	Kickboxer 2 : The Road Back delivers a knockout ! ! !	The sequel to Kickboxer is a good one ! KB2 has a good story . Sasha Mitchell is good and Peter Boyle , Dennis Chan , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , and John Diehl are also good but MY favorite is Michel Qissi ! He plays the unstoppable Tong Po again ! This time he is meaner , badder , and just much more of a maniac which he has become the ultimate fighter ! The film itself is a martial arts epic that brings just not the emotion but also action and feeling that for example when Tong Po made his first appearence David Sloan and his master was shocked and during the kickboxing match up you just felt like seeing it over and over due to its incredible impact and excitement when the action hits ! It also has some good music too ! Kickbboxer and martial arts fans rent this or watch it on tv soon but I recommend to you that if you see a good deal to buy it then do so because its worth it !

Frank Langella is just perfect as the Count . He does everything so superb with his eyes dancing , the way he moves his fingers , he is a big man and that makes his presence very haunting . His performance is flawless ! There has been many versions of Dracula including the legendary Bela Lugosi but Langella is arguably the best one of them all ! This film also co-stars legendary actors Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasence . The scenery is just beautiful with fog . The score by John Williams is arguably his best ! If you are for into love stories this Dracula film has a great one although at times it can be sad and especialy at the end . I recommend all Dracula and Frank Langella fans see this soon and be sure to watch it after sunset : )

517128	1132073	381290	10.0	Good Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of the most hilarious Three Stooges shorts is Jerks of All Trades . In this short are Emil Sitka and Symona Boniface ! The acting by these actors are good especially . There are many funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love ! In My opinion this one of the most different Three Stooges shorts . I recommend this one to all !
516890	1132073	82198	10.0	Good violent movie !	Conan the Barbarian is a very violent sword fighting movie that puts Arnold in alot bad situations . James Earl Jones is a bad villain here and his performance is good . Arnold packs a punch here also and Sandahl Bergman looks stunning ! Max von Sydow is good as always and Sven-Ole Thorsen looked menacing like he always does ! The score is awesome by Basil Poledouris . Conan the Barbarian has a sequel that is just as good as this called Conan the Destroyer ! If violent sword fighting is what you like then watch this great Arnold film soon !
516473	1132073	99528	10.0	Exorcist III is spooky and Brad Dourif makes it worse : )	Exorcist III is one heck of a spooky film . You never know what is going to happen in this chiller thriller . Once in a while in the film the great actor George C . Scott is funny . Brad Dourif puts on a fantastic performance that in MY opinion was oscar worthy . He put so much emotion and anger into this role I mean he did it all . He is always great in his films but this was outstanding ! Exorcist III is a very spooky film and I don't think anyone will be disappointed .

Fallen is a great film that has a great cast including Denzel Washington , John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , Embeth Davidtz , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Gabriel Casseus , Robert Joy , Frank Medrano , Bill Clark , and Graham Beckel ! The acting by all of these actors is unbelievable . Washington once again performed great . Goodman and Koteas arguably have the greatest performances in this picture ! Sutherland is excellent and Davidtz is just wonderful . Gandolfini is very different and Beckel has a brief but one heck of a performance ! I thought The horror is good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed really good . The music is great by Tan Dun . Ecellent directing by Gregory Hoblit ! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a great and thrilling film . If you like Denzel Washington , John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , Embeth Davidtz , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , the rest of the cast in the film , Horror , Mystery , Thriller , Action , Crime , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
