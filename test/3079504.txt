427949	3079504	182703	1.0	One of the worst acted films I've ever seen ( and the film making isn't much better either )	I'm not sure what to say about this film that will be helpful to anyone who wants to know about it . Frankly the only thing that comes to mind is don't . The story of two friends who's loyalty is tested when a woman comes between them is painful to watch . I've seen enough movies to know when there is a problem beyond the script , in this case its mainly the acting which is best categorized as bad . Its a combination of poor acting choices , characters posturing to look tough mixed with what can only be described in an overly generous mood as non-acting . Characters speak as if they are rehearsing rather than performing . Even Robert Z'Dar , of Maniac Cop fame , an actor you can always count on for a good performance comes across as phoning it in from three towns away . Its all very laughable . Technically this film isn't much better . The sets feel like they were left over from a bad high school music video . The camera work seems more like the point and shoot variety . My guess is that this was made for almost no money and it shows . ( An aside - while watching this movie I was struck by one thought over and over again , which might explain why the film is the way it is , and that is I'm not certain that this film was ever intended for an English language market . There is something about it that makes me think that this was made to be shipped over seas and dubbed in to Thai or Korean or Chinese . If thats the case I's suggest trying to find an import of this dubbed into a foreign language and subtitled back into English . - It's probably going to play better ) I really can't recommend this film to anyone unless they are trying to see every film with martial arts ever made . To put it another way I paid 99 cents for the DVD of this film and I feel ripped off .
427188	3079504	67179	1.0	Awful	Awful anime . The animation is even more limited than the stuff Rankin Bass would turn out years later . Its dubbed by Chuck McCann and friends for the Hal Roach Studios and its awful . I can't tell if the source was bad or the English dub , but its bad . Ten minutes and I was screaming , " no no no " while reaching for a bottle of rat poison . . . for the cartoon rat on screen , not me . I can't believe I've had this compared to the films of Disney , I don't think Disney ever made a movie this bad , or if they did they certainly didn't release it for the public to see . Not worth the time effort or money to see it . Avoid it if at all possible
428627	3079504	29207	1.0	One of the worst mysteries ever put on film	Eddie Quillan gives one of his worst performances as Ellery Queen . The plot involves the theft of a rare stamp and the murders that occur in its wake . Quillan , as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat . The mystery itself is fine . I can even live with the cheapness of the production ( nothing looks real ) . What I can't stand are the performances , no one in this cast with the exception of Frank Pangborn gives anything remotely like a performance . Can't anyone on screen act ? I guess not . The worst offender is Quillan who turns Ellery Queen into an insufferable twit . I wanted to smack him . Charming or disarming he's not . He ruins what could have been an okay bad movie . I hate this movie , I hate it a great deal .
426889	3079504	478216	1.0	One of the worst	Woman who may or may not be crazy has dreams about a demon called the nightmare man . It takes its form from a fertility mask and when she's left alone by her husband when they run out of gas the demon comes after her and chases her to a house in the woods . Awful just really awful . This was part of the after dark horror festival for this year and I'm shocked . Somewhere a while back I thought I saw on TV or in a horror fest or something ( months and months and months ago ) and I started it and hated it or at least disliked it enough to shut it off early on or walk out , this time unfortunately , as part of the After Dark festival , I suffered almost to the end . How this ended up in After Dark after that is beyond me . Its terrible . No one seems to be able to act which isn't entirely the casts fault since the direction is pretty poor . This reminded me of some really dreadful horror films from the early 1980's and late 1970's as the drive in films were dying . I'm talking films where Lawanda Paige was comic relief and big breasted " stars " took off their tops . You know a movie is bad when all I can say nice about it is that the women look good and some of them disrobe . I hope I never sit through this a third time .
427536	3079504	52604	2.0	This should have worked . . .	Maybe its the dubbing , but this story of a Greek hero who is at first the key to taking control of Athens and later to beating the invading the Persians , should have worked . Certainly it's the best looking Steve Reeves movie , with some really good action sequences but this movie is awful . If its not the the dubbing then perhaps its the editing and direction which appears to have taken the " lets use every piece of available footage " approach to film construction . Sequences go on and on and on . We Persians invade and we get to see every soldier land in Greece , and we see a boulder crash into a camera . Why couldn't the sequences have been trimmed . It makes things seem last for hours despite it only being 90 minutes long . Another clunker from Reeves .
428073	3079504	308132	2.0	Trash cinema	The original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added . The cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners . Poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy . Director Ted Mikel is a hack , but is so lovable a person ( I generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks ) that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out . Mikels wanted to make films and he didn't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something . More power to him , but I wish he wouldn't subject us to his home movies
429082	3079504	65603	2.0	Really bad horror film from the Phillipenes	This is a bad film . Its not a good bad movie , its just a bad movie . The plot has something to do with the adult children of a family finding out that their mother hasn't really been dead , rather she was changed into a vampire and had been kept locked up by their father in a secret crypt . I've run across this movie a under a couple of different names and under everyone of them its a turkey . Nothing in this film works . The acting is more like over the top soap opera spoof than any realistic . The aged Grannie who plays the vampire is more laughable than frightening with the result that you may hurt yourself from laughing at it all . for the occasional unintentional laugh , otherwise this is a movie to be avoided at all costs .
427940	3079504	784972	2.0	Stupid	Stupid , and I do mean stupid , tale of two home school raised social misfits with high IQ's who want to give their comatose dying father a grandchild , but are unable to get any woman to go out with them . Bob Odenkirk should keep this occasionally-very occasionally-funny but incredibly stupid movie off his resume if he ever wants to have sex again since its insulting to pretty much everyone . I don't know who's idea it was to make this movie but its yet another Jerk rip off that goes nowhere new . Yes , some of it is funny-the sky message bit at the end for example , but over all it just doesn't work , probably because the two main characters are clearly so stupid as to be believed . Only worth seeing if you stumble on it
427787	3079504	408839	2.0	failed mash up of romantic comedy and low brow humor	Yes , yes it is . Its just so bad its heartbreaking . Its as if two movies , a sweet romantic comedy was grafted onto a low brow comedy with the effect being it just awful . I mean that not because I think this should have been a sweet romantic comedy , rather that its so bad that not even the low brow humor works . Ben Stiller kind of sort of almost pulls it off , but the shifting of tone just derails the whole thing . ( Coming from me , a man who normally hates Ben Stiller this is high praise . ) Then again any film that makes Jerry Stiller just vulgar instead of vulgar but funny isn't to be bothered with .
428668	3079504	990376	2.0	A waste of time	released with no publicity or anything a few weeks back I saw this on a couple of movie Marquees and went to investigate . Family friendly ( they hoped ) TV movie about a 17 or 18 year old girl going to visit the family of a deceased childhood friend . There she runs into a mystery involving ghosts and a death curse . My notes from this are sketchy , mostly scribbles about how Rissa Walters as Sarah can't act . To be certain she looks good but its all over once she opens her mouth . The real question I seemed to have was how this ever got any sort of theatrical release , even one that rivals the release of Terry Jones Wind and the Willows ( Then again this has some promotional material , I remember a poster , wind in the willows didn't ) . A waste of time . Lets hope the promise of a series of Sarah Landon films never is fulfilled .
427462	3079504	186483	3.0	For buck its worth it	Clips from Bruce Lee's films he made as a child are followed by a knock off kung fu story without Lee that really isn't very good . I picked this up in the dollar bin and for a buck it was worth it . The opening stuff of Bruce Lee as a child is interesting since you see Lee's charisma even at an early age . Unfortunately the effort to stretch the film into something more falls flat since the non-archival stuff is really dreadful . I found myself scanning through the material hoping for something more that was good but it never came . I paid a buck . It was worth the buck to see the early films . It's not worth any more than that since after the early films is a good deal of really bad material .
427378	3079504	273169	3.0	The bits that do work just never really come together	Supernatural horror film about a young boy who's mother dies suddenly on his birthday . Years later a chain of events beginning with the death of a nun spirals him downward into the pit of hell . Mixed bag horror film that is has some really great images and a sense of things being really off that are under cut by a lack of budget ( The death by model plane that starts everything is laughable as are some of the other deaths ) and performances that aren't all there , with some of the cast seeming to have come from who ever was around that day . Its one of those films that almost works but falls just short so seems more like a missed opportunity then something you actually will want to sit through . To be fair those who don't mind trying films that don't work as a whole in order to see spooky imagery will want to give it ago for the bits that do work .
427819	3079504	897361	3.0	The not very clever twist is the only reason you'll keep watching this not very good film .	There have been a bunch of articles this week headlined " I Know Who Killed My Career " on how Lindsey Lohan's career problems are all her own doing . I guess its nice that Lohan can rest in knowing that the mess that is I know Who Killed Me isn't all her doing , after all film is a collaborative medium . A woman found on the road is believed to be some one who went missing , but gosh darn it no one believes that she's not who they think she is . The twist like much of this film just doesn't work or make any sense ( I was going to reveal the twist but honestly its the only reason to see the film because knowing it going in makes seeing it pointless ) . I mean why cast a 45 year old with a whiskey barrel voice as a young . . . oh wait Lohan is only 21 , sorry . Geeze she looks older than me , and older than her Mom . Anyway Lohan and her very lived in body aside this isn't a very good movie . I don't know what possessed me to see this but I did hoping for " The first great bad film of the year " which Newsday proclaimed it in its 0 star review . Unfortunately its not great , just bad .
427773	3079504	814314	3.0	One of the most maudlin and depressing films of the year ( This comment has SPOILERS )	( I'm going to discus the " twist " so if you don't want to know skip this and move on ) Will Smith gives an excellent performance in one of the most maudlin and WTF unnerving movies of the year . The film begins with Smith calling 911 and asking for an ambulance because some one has committed suicide . When the operator asks who it is , Smith says its himself . The movie then flashes back in a disjointed manner to tell the story of what happened to put him in the hotel bath tub filled with ice . The long and the short of it is that sometime before Smith had caused an accident while texting and driving that killed seven people . In order to make up for it Smith has decided to find seven deserving people and give them his organs . Yes this is a happy movie that makes you wonder what was Hollywood thinking . To be honest I'm not opposed to the basic plot line being used , I'm more opposed to the way the story is told . They jumble the story to keep the fact that Smith dies a " secret " . They then show Smith as he tries to pick the people he will help and deals with his guilt-which isn't fully revealed until his final moments . Its bravo for Smith as its clear he's got great acting chops . As for the director and writer I have to ask what were you thinking ? You've created a film that is almost completely depressing and terribly illogical . If nothing else why would anyone put up with the bullying and brow beating that Smith directs toward some people . I'd have told both him and his horse where to go . What really bothers me is that because of how the film is constructed the air of death hangs over the entire film . Its another sub genre of the death porn franchise . Weee ! I could go on ( I never mentioned the clichés yet ) but I won't . Needless to say this is not a favorite film for me . I'm sure this is destined for Hollywood infamy as a film of some ( ill ) repute . ( Hey as they say the best camp films are the ones that aren't made intentionally campy but end up playing that way . ) Between three and because of Will Smith's performance .
427031	3079504	785007	3.0	The obnoxiousness of the lead character makes this tough to get through	Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel ( without wings ) falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her . She is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend , a psychic who can see her . Obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichéd sort of way , except that Longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film . Its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper . To be fair Longoria , nor anyone else in the cast or crew , isn't the problem , its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings . Its just really really stupid .
428323	3079504	74390	3.0	Not much of anything	Cameron Mitchel is listed as starring in , but in fact barely appears in this story of a maniac stalking and killing women . Confused and confusing story kind of builds a little bit of suspense but to me , at the late hour I was watching it , found it more fragments of a film then something that holds together . This is the sort of film that would have been a direct to video release if it were made now . Then again I picked this up in the dollar bin so its even lower than that . I don't know what else to say other than its just sort of there . For Cameron Mitchell fans only .
427108	3079504	490204	3.0	Unreal characters and cliché handling of events will make you not care	Don Cheadle once again proves he's better than the material in this misfire about a man reconnecting with his college room mate . The room mate , played by Adam Sandler is a shell of his former self , reduced to wandering the streets since took his wive and children . Clearly well meaning this movie is alien in its relationships and motivations . No real person speaks and acts the way many of the characters do . Its all artificial as if in crafting a movie that would offend almost no one they crafted the life out of it . Think 1950's drama with a modern " edge " Its not bad as such , just nowhere near good enough to bother with . . . or keep watching . And this brings up a question - is it too early for to be a cliché ? yet again we have another grieving survivor haunted by the last things said . Is this now to be the the way to go ? It seems like every movie or play has some sort of reference to it . I can't believe that we're finally starting to deal with the event in popular culture and we've already driven right into the rut of cliché
428541	3079504	74800	3.0	Even as a time capsule this film is dull and unfunny	The plot has adult film star Linda Lovelace running for President as the only person the leaders of a political party could agree on . She goes on the campaign trail in a film that is full of political and social commentary humor , not to mention jokes of the lowest denominator . The film-making is poor . its the sort of scatter shot " lets make a movie " with grade C stars and comedians running about in jokes that are best described a vaudeville or burlesques last gasp . Its the sort of film that is similar to Groove Tube , Loose Shoes , American Raspberry or Kentucky Fried Movie , except as a political campaign . The problem is the material , that which isn't old to begin with , isn't very good . To be certain some of the material is funny in a one off sort of way but mostly is just stupid . The sad thing is that Lovelace actually comes off a pretty good screen actress . certainly she's more real than many of todays adult film stars who try to cross over into mainstream films . Its a shame she never had the chance to do something more than be infamous . Supposedly this exists in 3 different cuts PG , R and X . The version I saw had the X rating attached to the end , though most of the offensive material was some language , soft core sex and nudity and I seriously doubt it would get an X or NC-17 today . Nothing is exciting in any sense of the word . Its bland . its dull . Its ( mostly ) unfunny . Its a turkey
428857	3079504	362084	3.0	Aliens invade a small bayou town in a not very good film that has only the monsters and some sick humor to recommend it	Loser stuntman shows up at a Beef Pie Festival to jump 40 oil cans and falls in love with the organizers daughter . When the stunt goes wrong he's sent away for 130 years . Breaking out of prison he heads back to his lady love , just in time for the next Festival and an alien invasion . Quirky and one of a kind , this riff on the sort of films that started Peter Jackson on his road to the Oscars is a love it or hate it proposition . I damn near hate the film . No where near as good as anything Jackson ever turned out , its a game attempt at something different but falls as flat as road kill . Its odd and off beat for no real reason other than to be odd and off beat ( all of the characters are " characters " and have little connection to reality ) . At times fitfully funny , often in a cruel way , this film just seems to just want to break taboos and be strange . There are numerous musical sequences , which while fine seem to go on too long . Worse I really didn't like anyone . The real reason to see the film is the aliens . Mostly seen as floating blips with tentacles , these are lean mean killing machines . Heads fly , blood splatters and bad jokes are cracked ( I liked the conversation about how one victims face was sucked off ) . These are wild and wanton beasties and are almost worth the price of a rental . Unfortunately they really don't show up until the last half hour , by which point you may have turned off the movie and put on a Golden Girls rerun . I can't recommend this film to anyone except tolerant gore hounds and monster lovers who are advised to keep the remote handy for frequent fast forwarding . Everyone else is advised to rent a Peter Jackson film instead . for the monsters and a few cruel jokes that work
429126	3079504	448157	3.0	Major misfire with too much going on . Only comes alive in sporadic moments	Major misfire from Will Smith concerning a superhero with a drinking problem who decides to redo his image of destruction . Based on what many have considered a great script " Tonight He Comes " ( which I haven't read but which I've read about ) this is a movie with some really good ideas , which after bobbling them for an hour drops them as they add another 15 to the mix . The idea is that its lonely being a superhero and that one would eventually begin to drink because one was all alone . Drink causes problems as does anger problems - usually resulting in millions of dollars in insurance claims . The idea is rather clever and its one thats been used before in better films like Superguy : Behind the Cape a pseudo-documentary about the problems of being a superhero . Its a good idea as I said and there are moments here where they pull it off but its only in the odd moment and every now and again . ( even if there are tons of unanswered logic problems ) Which is fine for the first hour where the jokes and the effort to put something together comes across as an okay time filler ( which I hated to spend money on-at its best this is a cable flick ) . The trouble is that about an hour into the movie it begins to add in plot points that come out of left field . First there is a twist that plays out badly over the next half hour then a major plot development occurs that drives the film to its conclusion . In that last half hour enough plot for at least another 90 minutes is set up and the rushed through . Of course the twists are so WTF that with in the context of the film that as it stands now that the film completely falls on its face . I kept wanting to reach for the remote to jump to the end ( curse the movie theater experience ) . There is a good story in there somewhere but someone-probably several someones - botched the film . ( I read there were lots of rewrites and passes through the editing suites ) A perfect example of how not to make a movie by committee ( and will probably be on my worst of the year list for that reason ) . a final ( despite some early moments and great lines ) This kind of skirts the PG13 and R border . I thought it was R until I saw other wise . Frankly its probably more R then PG13 thanks to language and violence
426915	3079504	26353	4.0	Creaky poverty row action film is passable time killer	The problem with some of the low end early sound films is that they feel like they are leadenly paced . Partly this was due to a lack of music and partly it was due to a lack of skill in putting together something special . In The Fighting Pilot its a combination of both , which proves almost deadly to a film thats suppose to be an action adventure flick . The plot concerns the attempt to get the designs of a new plane by some bad guys . The boyfriend of the inventor's daughter finds that he has to run interference between the inventors and gangsters who are out to make a buck or two at the expense of everyone else . Its a proved story thats been done before both better and worse . The problem here is that the film was done on the cheap . Everything other than the planes look lack luster . There is an absence of music so the proceedings are slowed way down , even in the action scenes . The fights are more flailing affairs where the actors thrash about wildly in and attempt to look like they are really fighting , while attempting not to harm anyone or anything on the meager sets . It looks more silly then anything else . On the positive side the cast is mostly game with stalwart Richard Talmadge playing the pilot of the title . Talmadge was a solid actor who never really graduated to anything past the B movies , but was always good none the less . Over all this is an okay movie that is overly creaky due to the passage of time and the lack of money in the budget . If it had been a tiny bit more engaging I'd say give it a shot , but there is something about the way the movie stands right now that is very likely to send you to Dreamland and not the " Wild Blue Yonder " . Still if you're feeling adventurous and not too worried about possibly dozing off I'd give it a try . Somewhere between 4 and .
428481	3079504	26360	4.0	Story meanders too much and the leads are unlikable to be much of anything	Young woman plays a game of chicken with a young man speeding down the road unaware that he is racing to a fire . She cuts him off and he crashes into a light post . He takes her car and continues on his way . It's a meet cute that leads into a story of the pair and how it connects to arson and insurance fraud . It's a good looking film with a real sense of place thanks to it not being sound stage bound ( The fire department scenes are neat ) . The problem for me was that the film seems to meander all around being more about the semi idle rich then about crime . Whats worse is the characters are more annoying rather than endearing . I lost patience with the film about a third of the way through and began to do other things until the last ten minutes when boy and girl race off to prevent a fire at warehouse that was being intentionally set . All the excitement at the very end-its great but there's a slog to get there . Its not a bad , though its probably just okay at best , movie but it was probably the wrong movie for my mood last night .
426925	3079504	455195	4.0	Is this serious or a joke ?	Messy form over content police thriller ( comedy ? ) has a cop , who is trying to come to terms with a long missing girlfriend , lose a witness in an organized crime case to an assassin . How the cop , the girlfriend and the assassins all interrelate is the film . I didn't know whether director Benny Chan was serious or not . Chan a good director ( New Police Story ) for the most part though occasionally he tries to do too much and the pieces don't come together ( Rob B Hood ) . Here nothing seems to work and it all seems like a TV movie . The action isn't real , its done for artistic effect - the early strangulation where the victim claws the paint of the truck for example . Whats worse its laughable - the sequence where our hero finds the picture of his lost girl in his car and takes his foot off the brake while on a steep incline had me howling . Actually I just gave up on the film and jumped to the end . For me its one of the real disappointments I've seen recently , even if it does have a couple of good sequences-the plastic bag fight for example .
428686	3079504	1204883	4.0	Bland dull and completely not needed	Supernatural weirdness on a college campus as a girl sees her room mate commit suicide and there after begins to see the boogeyman doing in her classmates everywhere . This is a bland direct to DVD sequel that isn't as horrible as you might think , but was obviously made for money not love . Its too mechanical to be scary with the film's choice of shots being weak , especially since many shots and sequences go on to long . Its almost good , but not quite . Pretty much unnecessary since its nether good enough to worth watching nor bad enough to use as a target for pithy remarks . somewhere around
428492	3079504	56954	4.0	Dull	Class war in Ancient Rome . The plot of Marcus , renamed Coriolanus after a victory , switching sides to expose the evils of Rome's leaders , is a snooze fest . The first third is dull court intrigue . The middle third is great action , that will get your hopes up . Unfortunately the final third is worse than the first and will bore you to tears . As good as the middle is the ends kill it . This is a movie to make you pull your hair out because whats good is so good that you end up with no patience for the bad parts . Making everything worse is the fact that the dubbing into English is terrible making the already iffy performances seem worse . A void unless you need sleep , or can manage only to see the middle third .
428331	3079504	419984	4.0	Some laughs in a one dimensional tale thats been done before	Self-help guru who hated his gym teacher goes home to find his mom engaged to said teacher , stilted merriment tries to ensue . The idea is sound the execution isn't . Woodcock , Billy Bob Thorton's gym teacher character is much too one dimensional to really work since he has one expression the whole time . Sean William Scott as the self help guru tries too hard to be wacky and falls on his face . Actually the script just doesn't work since its so obvious where its going . There are laughs and smiles despite of the lack of it all hanging together , and one " Whoa " nervous " oh crap he really got hurt " laugh towards the end . Worth a look on a slow night on cable where you'll be more forgiving of the dull bits on the way to the good ones .
428289	3079504	122038	4.0	It may have great action but its a long slow slog to get to it	A vicious gang of jewel thieves is operating in Hong Kong . Using a cabaret as a front they are smuggling jewels all over the orient , and leaving a trail of dead women who acted as couriers . After a jewel robbery leaves a good number of people dead a special all female unit is formed to see if it can get the goods on the robbers . This Shaw Brothers film is a mess . First off other than the robbery and a training exercise there is really no action for the better part of an hour ( if you've seen the trailer your seeing the training exercise and the final battle cut together ) . When the action finally happens its basically a few short fights followed by a very long battle that caps the film . Its all great stuff of the highest order , but by the time you encounter it its almost too little too late . The film also makes very little sense outside of the gem smuggling central theme . There's a side story about one of the bad guys who's a knife throwing ( as in on stage ) sadist with the women but it really doesn't go anywhere . One of the police women is dating the son of the dead owner of the jewelry store that was robbed but that seems more like an after thought than anything real . By the time the final battle happens odds are you'll just be watching for the fights , I know I was . This is only worth seeing if you come in in the middle since thats when all of the fighting starts . It will also give the illusion that the movie makes sense since you can assume you missed something ( which you haven't ) . For martial arts complete-ists only . FYI - Two points to note , the trailer for this film seems to contain different footage from the film . It maybe the result of the print I saw which was dubbed into English and subtitled in Greek , but I didn't see anyone drive a motorcycle through a wall . Secondly early on when the all female unit is formed we see several photographs of the dead couriers . One them is of a woman who is killed later in the movie by the knife wielding sadist .
428439	3079504	253474	4.0	Over-rated story of survival	I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me . Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him , but I never really connected to the story . I never really cared . I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that . Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play , in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal . I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter . Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care . Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him . I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable , which means this movie meant nothing to me . This film is a major disappointment
428027	3079504	71465	4.0	Some weird images and not much sense	Weird exorcist inspired horror film from the man responsible for the Blind Dead films . The story has something about an old witch using the daughter of a politician to get revenge . . . and then something . It wasn't 100 % clear . Creepy at times because of the imagery rather than the story this is a lost little film that probably isn't really a loss being lost . That said I'm going to try to watch this again down the road when its not 2am . Whether you should take a stab at seeing this I'm not sure . Its images aside I'm not sure there is enough to recommend it , though if you get it in a multi-film DVD set like I did I'd give it a shot .
427917	3079504	417148	4.0	Bad special effects and a way too knowing attitude ruin what should have been a fun flight to disaster	Spoilers AheadBad . why'd have to be bad ? Since Indiana Jones wouldn't take the job they got Samuel L Jackson to do it . And he does it quite well in possibly the only real performance in the entire movie . Okay you know the story : Jackson is taking a witness to a murder from Hawaii to Los Angeles , however the king pin doesn't want the witness to arrive alive so he fills the plane with snakes which come out half way into the flight , the idea being that the plane goes down and no one is the wiser . Pre-sold , ultra-hyped and thought to be a shoe in as a so " bad its good " classic this movie had many people , myself included dying to see it . Yea , well I've seen it and I really wish I hadn't . Clearly made by a committee , this movie is a mess , some of it intentional . The idea was to make throw back to the schlocky 1970's horror movies that played in the drive ins . The problem is that while they got a great deal of it right , at least on paper , they messed up in execution . The story is classic exploitation . That they got right . However they messed up in the way things happen . The snake attacks for example happen in a check list sort of way . Bite naked breast ? Check . Bite guy urinating ? Check ? Giant Snake tries to swallow man ? Check . Its all done as if down a list , and since the list takes priority ( since that's what people want to see ) the rest of the movie becomes a confused mess as the filmmakers try to get the survivors to the next snake attack opportunity . None of it is logical , its just what ever seemed like a good idea at the time to link the " wow " moments . Actually I think the best way to describe it all as a series of punchlines with no set up . The performances are , outside of Jackson either merely adequate or way too knowing . The problem with the movie is this sense of knowing . The films in the 70's were played straight and that's where the charm was . Here the actors and the director let you know that they know you know this is ridiculous and the result is film that borders dangerously on parody . With movies like this you have to either go one way or the other not both . The best way is to go straight and let the audience sort it out . The special effects aren't , what's worse in order to be charming the film intentionally goes for the rubber snakes . It also goes for heavily CGI snakes none of which look even remotely in the film with the actors . Its clear a good portion of the snakes are in that cartoon never-land that is poor special effects . ( when will people learn the reason old special effects tended to work was that we knew on some level these things were there , in some form , with the actors , not completely added later ) This movie is hugely disappointing . It's just a bad movie with some clever bits . Wait for cable .
427629	3079504	74958	4.0	One of the Most Over Rated Movies in the Last 30 Years	I've seen this movie probably ten times since its been released and I have yet to understand what is so wonderful about it . Its not a matter of looking at it now and wondering if time has over taken it , it never worked for me . For me the film simply was " shocking " to seem clever even though it never really was . Certainly it hard to look at the film now and not think how psychic it was , but I think that was by accident , or perhaps it was the networks simply copying what they saw here and using it to boost their ratings . The story of a network which radically rethinks what its going to broadcast after its anchorman goes mad and decides to kill himself on camera is ripe with possibilities . The film makers certainly explore many of them , but at the same time each time I've watched it I've always been left feeling like I've missed something , or rather that the film is not as clever as it thinks it is . Try it , but don't feel stupid if you don't get it . . . I don't think there is anything to get .
429069	3079504	179829	5.0	animated re-imagining of the bible and history as an alien intervention story	The premise of this film is that GD , his son Red and a space ship load of other people end up on earth after they can no longer go home . GD had stocked the ship with genetic information in order to save his dying world and he now uses it to manipulate the creatures on earth for his own benefit . All the while he's challenged by his son , who thinks that his dad should leave well enough alone . Spinning out the biblical tales as a scifi battle between father and son this is at times very clever take on mankind's origins . Dealing with allusions of everything from the Garden of Eden , Moses , Christ , Darwin's theory of evolution , the fall of Satan , modern history , this movie has a wealth of clever ideas . The problem is that some ideas are glossed over while others go on way too long . There is no balance and the film races in fits in starts to its ending . This is a film you love because of its ideas more than its execution , which at times is a bit ragged , Personally I like the film as an idea , however as it been put forth on the screen I think its a scatter shot affair with much of the humor falling flat . This is the type of thing you could try if you run across it but its not something you need search out .
428235	3079504	26230	5.0	Atmospheric little film that won't win any awards but is perfect as part of a horror fest on a dark and stormy night	Vampiresque tale of a madman loose in a small village in the middle of the 19th century . Someone is tearing the throats out of villagers after dark . Who could it be and how does it relate to the events years earlier when a shipwrecked pregnant woman was bitten on the neck by a vampire bat ? Well made melodrama with horrific overtones take many horror conventions and breathes just a bit of new life in them , Give this movie a good many points for daring to be different in its supernatural tinged tale . Add to it a great cast headed by Frank Morgan and Misha Auer ( as a hunchback ) and you get a fine little lost film . Sure it won't win any awards but as a movie to watch on a dark and stormy night with the lights on low its gangbusters Worth seeing , especially if you program a night of moldy oldie horror films .
427232	3079504	34854	5.0	Mildly amusing sequel is better than what went before and perfect if you want something that won't tax you in anyway	This is the sequel to Private Snuffy Smith and is better than what went before . The story picks up with Snuffy still in the army and in a shooting contest with Sgt Gatling . Gatling wins because Snuffy isn't allowed to use his squirrel gun . Gatling is then ordered to take Snuffy and some other men to the backwoods in order to protect the prototype of a new rocket that will help in the war effort . Once there Snuffy meets his cousin Barney Google who has a stake in the invention . Things get complicated when spies arrive to destroy the invention and steal the plans . Based on the once popular comic strip the movie is step up from the previous film . Instead of several loosely connected parts ( a real problem in the first movie ) the film has one story from beginning to end , so it has time to actually build up situations and characters that can produce laughs . By no means a great film , this film is amusing and by the end does manage to produce a few laughs , and while they are not belly laughs they are laughs none the less ( something Private Snuffy Smith never managed ) . The humor and the plot are pretty much by the book and you'll know where its going well before the characters do but if you're in a really forgiving mood it won't matter much . I'm on the fence about recommending this film . Its okay - just okay . Certainly there are better ways of spending your time and money , but if you stumble across it and want something that won't clog the recesses of your brain with anything what so ever I'd give it a try , especially if you like hillbilly humor .
427388	3079504	1037218	5.0	The actors are better than the material	Daniel Craig commands the screen in a cliché story about an actor on the way down who gets word that a childhood friend has died , which of course spins him off into remembering what used to be . Its a cliché tale thats been done before in one way or another . The film is a very well made and extremely well acted especially by Daniel Craig who proves yet again he's probably the best of any actor who's played James Bond . The problem here is the script which takes way too long to get going . Its almost a full half hour before we begin the hour long center section of the film that explains , in part why things are they way they are . As well done as it is it isn't anything we haven't seen before , and once we returned to the present I kind of had a feeling how bits of the last half hour would play out . Its not a bad film , but it is yet again another one thats good enough to make you wish that it was better .
427455	3079504	35758	5.0	Meandering and unfocused	Based on a radio show this short ( an hour ) film is a bit of a meandering mess . the plot of the film has two gangs going to war and somehow in the middle of it all the daughter of an oil man is kidnapped . As the police try to solve the crime ( s ) , Cosmo Jones , a genius and amateur criminologist forces himself into the case . This is a weird film where the title character doesn't show up for a quarter of the running time . When he does show up he sort of seems as if he were added into the mix for no good reason , with a young police Sargent taking the lead . Its not until into the second half of the film that he takes center stage . Another weird twist is Mantan Moreland who is listed fourth in the credits as a " star " and he only shows up close to the half way mark in a role that requires him to do little more than stand around for most of his screen time ( I guess a pay check is a pay check ) . The problem is that the film wanders to and fro with out any real direction . Its starts off as a gangster story , shifts to the cops , shifts again to gang war film , turns again into a murder tale then swerves into the kidnap tale . Characters take center stage then fall to the background over and over again , not like in an ensemble film where there is ebb and flow , instead its like seeing a series of almost unconnected photographs . The result is a rather bland and un-involving movie , which is a shame since the film does have some genuinely good moments ( the near torture of Moreland is horrifying in a very real way ) and there are more than its share of funny lines . Not really worth seeking out , I'd pretty much let this one slide unless I ran across it on TV , in which case it would be worth taking a peak .
428367	3079504	269217	5.0	Wild anything goes film-making	Parody / homage / pastiche / ( take your pick ) film thats a send up of romance movies and Italian westerns . so over the top you'll wonder if there ever was a top , this is one wild ride , even by Thai movie standards . With blood and gore and painted backgrounds mixing with real locations and a very deliberate sense of reality this film is either going to strike you as a master piece or a piece of cow flop . I'm somewhere in the middle-leaning towards the dislike camp . The problem for me its so artificial I that I was watching the wheels and gears whir instead of watching the story unfold . I also am not really in love with the idea that this is almost two hours long . Overwhelmed with the artifice I turned it off a good clip in . The reaction is not really unexpected since I have a real love hate relations hip with the Thai film industry where I find I either lover or hate the films , there is no rhyme or reason other than I dislike most Thai horror films I stumble upon on my own . Is Black Tiger worth seeing ( or should that be trying ? ) ? Hell yea . There is nothing like it for shaking the dust from the notion of all movies are the same . There is nothing like this I've ever seen in the west and very few in the east .
428591	3079504	22358	5.0	If you can get past the annoying Zasu Pitts this is an okay mystery with a neat solution	Rich slimeball Folsom refuses to marry his mistress because he is married . He refuses to divorce his wife because that would mean he had to marry his mistress . Not long after a complicated confrontation in his apartment with the wife , the bodyguard and the mistress ( who I think kills herself ) Folsom is killed . It then becomes a question of who did it and why . Creaky murder mystery is okay once it gets going . Its a typical talky early sound mystery that seems a bit too ripe for its own good . Really working against the film is Zasu Pitts as a phone operator in the building where the action takes place . She is a shrill Greek chorus of sorts commenting on the events . If you can get past the shrillness the mystery is good with its solution worth taking the hour to watch this . To be honest I wasn't loving it , more liking it , until I got to the end at which point I was like , " Oh that was cool " . Its something you'll watch once , but worth the look if you get past the Pitts .
428642	3079504	113492	5.0	Over produced	This comic adaption has some great things in it . Max von Sydow for example , some of the photography in some sequences , but it has too much wrong with it to be anything other than okay . Stallone of over the top , Rob Schneider is too silly , a misreading of the characters and a bloatedness that only too much money can buy . The problems with the movie are best summed up by the main street set which is huge . It looks great , it looks wonderful . It is shown repeatedly from only one angle . You never really move off this one street , and you never change perspective , it always the same shots from the same angles probably because they couldn't shoot it any other way . Its not as bad as you've heard , but its not good . My suggestion is a big tub of popcorn , some friends in a bitchy mood and this movie for a fine roast fest of Hollywood excess .
426950	3079504	25263	5.0	A very mixed affair thats more curiosity than anything else	Big budget movie concerning Jimmy Durante throwing a party so that Baron Munchhausen will let him use his killer lions in an up coming entry in his Schnarzan series . Various stars show up and sing and dance . Scatter-shot - and I do mean scatter-shot musical comedy showcasing many of MGM's lesser stars . Its a good segment followed by a poor , a great throw away line followed by a poor one . Huge production numbers are done to mediocre songs . Its an odd ball affair that I picked up on a used VHS tape because its the only film I know that has both Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges ( who were still working with Ted Healy ) . Stan and Ollie , who's pictures are on the sleeve of the tape don't show up until about 55 minutes into the film . They are very good , but no match for Lupe Valez who runs over them and everyone else she comes in contact with . She is the best human in the film . ( She was a great actress with the right part ) . The Stooges show up about 35 minutes in and play autograph hounds trying to get signatures . they are good but their bit is simply too short to really work . Of real interest ( and the best thing besides Velez ) is the appearance of Mickey Mouse . This is a cantankerous Mickey who gets into a fight with Durante before singing a song which leads into an animated segment called Hot Chocolate Soldiers . This is a light song about a chocolate soldier army going to war against gingerbread people . The images are rather dark and nasty and had I been a kid the whole thing might have given me nightmares . ( or not since the darkness comes from knowing what war is , which as a child I wouldn't have understood as well . ) Its an strange piece that like much of the film doesn't fit with anything else . ( It also seems more like a Fleischer or Van Buren cartoon as opposed to a Disney one . Worth a look on TV , but not as something to search out , odds are anyone loving old movies or cartoons will find something to like ( even as they find much to dislike ) . for the good and the bad .
427910	3079504	478303	5.0	5 uneven Tales From the Crypt style stories done cheaply by master directors makes for just okay viewing	Tales from the Crypt like anthology of a group of people on a studio tour who get trapped in a " psycho " like house and tell ghost stories to escape . Of interest mainly for the directors involved-Joe Dante , Ken Russel , Sean Cunningham , Monte Hellman the film itself is a mixed bag . One story has to do with an actress getting her breasts done , another has to do with a Stanley Kubrick like director and an actor friend , Another has to do with a couple who go to Japan and discover a hanged man and the last has to do with a young woman and her twin . . or something . Three of the four stories aren't bad , if over long . One ( the girl and her twin ) is just fair . The problem is the films don't really add up to much , more so that the sting in each tale is left for the very end of the film where we are told what really happened . Its a weird way to do it , and it almost works , but not quite since any tension from the stories are long gone by the final revelations ( There is also a couple of lapses of internal logic as a result of the breaking apart . ) Worth a look on a slow Saturday on cable . I do have to say that the Ken Russell " Girl with the Golden Breasts " tale is very amusing and a vast improvement over his direct to video home movies . I especially loved his cameo .
428575	3079504	365737	5.0	A movie of the head but not the heart	Its been several days since I saw this film and find that it not only is receding from my memory but that I also am less in love with the film ; so much so that I dropped my rating down two points in the interim . When this tale of the Middle East , oil and the people who try to control both was done I felt that I had a great deal to say and I decided to wait until I found the words before I wrote up anything . The trouble is that days have passed and I find that the words have left me . I find that what I thought was an emotional response on my part was instead emptiness . While I was given much to think about , I find that I really don't feel passionately enough about the movie to explore the ideas presented . Hours after the film ended I no longer cared about it or its ideas . I find it sad that a film with so much important to say can erase any desire to go beyond the screen , or even revisit the movie . Don't get me wrong this is a well made movie , the problem is that when they filed it full of ideas they forgot to put in a heart . , a well made film of ideas that fails to engage your heart
426970	3079504	40472	5.0	Well made but its got a story you've seen a dozen or more times before	Late in the game film revisiting of the classic radio anthology series . Several years prior to this Universal released a series of films starring Lon Chaney Jr based on the series . In that series Chaney played a different character in each supernatural tinged story . Here there are no big stars . The story begins on a train where a strange man who seems to know the time with out a watch and knows the rain route having never been on it before , tells a fellow passenger the story of someone who got off a train when they were warned not to . The bulk of the film is the story told which concerns murder and attempts to cover it up with the clearly visible sting in the tail of how the story is a warning of future events . Its a good but unremarkable little film , one where you can pretty much guess whats going to happen ( which is the reason I'm sparse on details , if I tell you any more than I have you'll figure it all out in about ten minutes ) . Its worth a look but its far from memorable because its so easy to know whats going to happen .
427380	3079504	132184	6.0	Retro regional horror is okay of taken on its own terms	Five people stay over night in Hanley House , a supposed Haunted Mansion that has been left sitting unoccupied since the Hanley's abruptly up and left years before , leaving all of their things behind . Good little horror film that was the sort of thing to play on the bottom of a drive-in multiple feature this is a movie that seems to have been about five to ten years out of date from when it was released-Its black and white and low on gore and monsters meaning it had nothing on the films that say Roger Corman was turning out , nor does it have the shock value of Night of the Living Dead . Clearly made on the cheap the film still manages to create some tension with its use of shadows and dry ice . The cast is game if uneven and all over the place . Its worth a look if you're in the mood for a retro-drive in night or want something more akin to the Haunting then something more graphic .
428222	3079504	1066329	6.0	Its okay , but I'm not sure its Oscar material	This is the story of a priest trying to save the soul of a miserly gentleman by giving him a glimpse of the next life . From a technical aspect this is great film . The detail is wonderful , look at all of the nick knacks in the small cottage , the dreaminess of heaven , and watch how the car races down the road and around the corners with everything jangling about . Its a joy to see . The characters are wonderfully amusing and expressive and I can only imagine what say The Triplets of Belleville would have looked like in this style of animation . The problem is that the characters aren't given much to do . Its basically a long build up to an okay joke . I went searching for the film when it was nominated for an Oscar this morning . Its an amusing story that is good but not great . I can see how in the right frame of mind this is very funny . But it amused me more than it made me smile . I doubt that its going to stick in my memory .
428500	3079504	338013	6.0	I can't be objective	I'm at a loss here to be objective about this movie set in a persons mind simply because as good as it is , I can't get past reality . It begins on a railway platform with commuters waiting to go to work on Valentines Day 2004 , which would be nice , except it was a Saturday . While due to circumstances of the plot this could be okay , the problem is that the rest of the film was set in " real " places that I know , none of which seemed like the real place . I kept jumping out of the film despite excellent performances , to quibble about the reality of the film . That aside it wasn't a bad movie but more three stars rather than the four that most people are giving it .
427789	3079504	308055	6.0	Too many characters sink the ship	Intersecting lives at the Ambassador Hotel on the day Bobby Kennedy was shot . Emilio Estevez has made an extremely well acted film which suffers from a weak script that tries too hard . It tries to get too many details right ( too many movie references and the time ) that the we notice the details but not the bigger story . Additionally this is a film with a large selection of characters . Its too many for the running time with the result that not enough of them are really fleshed out . I almost wish that we were allowed to just follow a couple of the characters instead of all of them ( it feels as though we're following everyone in the hotel ) since there are almost too many to keep track of . Its a shame since the film is otherwise extremely well made . An interesting misfire .
428466	3079504	74356	6.0	Story of a Bigfoot like monster on the loose is best watched at night with the lights out	Two college students from Chicago decide to investigate the stories of a Bigfoot-like creature in the area around Black Lake Louisiana . Once there they find that no one wants to talk to them about the creature . However they begin to make friends who open up with tales of the creature . They end up in a battle for their lives when the creature comes after them . Drive-in fare from the 1970's is much better than its reputation would suggest . While certainly not the scariest movie ever made it does have its share of chills as the little seen monster causes mayhem to those who stray with in its grasp . I don't know what my reaction would have been had I seen this is a drive-in back in ' 76 and then driven home in the rural south . My guess is I would be dreading hearing the creepy cry of the creature ( a cry I know my brothers would have loved to imitate to scare anyone who saw the film ) . Definitely worth a look for those who don't need their horror films to be slick modern productions . ( And recommended for a dark and stormy night with the lights out ) 6 . ( 6 for IMDb purposes )
426882	3079504	276919	6.0	You'll Either Love It or Hate It	The story of what happens when Nichole Kidman arrives in Dogville is either going to thrill you or strike you as one of the worst films of all time . There is no set to speak of , only lines on the ground so the film comes off as nothing more than a filmed stage play . And while John Hurt's narration adds a dimension of literary quality to the proceedings , proving this is probably a better movie to listen to then watch . The performances are uniformly excellent across the board and those wishing to see great acting should see this . . . . . . but the movie goes on way too long and ends up being one of the most bleak films in recent memory . I'm not sure what the point of it all is and any ideas I did have got lost with the three hour running time . As I said you'll either love it or hate it - Me I'm in the five percent of people who'll be on the fence . .
428547	3079504	167820	6.0	There are two versions of this - a short Chritopher Lee narrated one and a 26 part series	The short two hour look at a couple of Scifi subjects via film clips ( from trailers ) is a companion piece to the similar One Hundred Years of Horror . This is a history of science fiction told through a few interviews as well as with clips from various movies culled from movie trailers which are in the public domain . Like the horror film this film also has a longer 26 part version . However where the short Horror film made you want to see the longer version ( which is a masterpiece of Horror history when viewed in its entirety ) , this makes you want to move on to the next thing . Its a shame since the longer 26 part version of this film is actually pretty good . Its not the horror series but its still fun to watch thanks to all of the clips that it contains . The short version is narrated by Christopher Lee who simply links some of the segments with some oblique references . ( Lee is not in the long version ) . Given the choice I'd opt for the longer version and skip this short one .
428494	3079504	241527	6.0	What I say doesn't matter	I'm not a fan of the books . The ones I read seem like Roald Dahl wannabes . To me the books were young adult fiction that seems like young adult fiction . This the , film version of the first book is actually pretty good , but suffers painfully from the fact that it attempts to get everything in the book on the screen . I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel . If you want to see a good , but not great movie , and to get a faithful feeling for one of the most successful series of books ever made without having to days reading the books then by all means watch this , just expect frequent draggy spots .
427987	3079504	990361	6.0	Weird , unpleasant and needing a second viewing	Weird unpleasant and unnerving murder mystery that I still haven't completely unraveled . It begins with two men hitting a pedestrian , stealing the money he was carrying and getting mixed up with a kidnapping . Meanwhile a young detective with two kids investigates a murder that seems to be related . Thats a poor attempt at explaining this odd film , honestly there is no way to simply explain this with out giving too much away . Think Silence of the Lambs meets Seven meets something similar . Its a weird frigging movie requires you to pay attention and deal with often heavy weirdness . Worth a look if you like very strange unsettling films . I'm not sure what I think of it completely or that I got everything after one late night viewing . I'm going to have to try it again when I'm much less tired . ( A word of warning its got some scenes of heavy sexuality , including hardcore graphic sex in at least one scene on a TV screen , so keep the kids away . )
428335	3079504	432021	6.0	Forget the plot ( the filmmakers did ) this is worth seeing for the action and monster sequences	Survivors of the virus that has ravaged the world , turning the dead into zombies and the world into a vast wasteland , have learned to keep moving least the zombies find them . Milla Jovovich returns as Alice , zombie killer number one . After some lone wanderings in the Desert she hooks up with a band of travelers and looks to stop the evil Umbrella corporation once and for all . Not as good as the last film but better than the first one . I don't think that the film's plot makes a whole heck of a lot of sense , which is fine since the numerous action set pieces are so tightly wound you can pretty much forgive the poor plotting . I mean the last time I checked people tended to watch these films for the blood , the gore and the monster killing . Upping the ante with some killer crows and some beast which shall remain nameless this film just moves like the wind with in each extended action sequence ( Forget Hitchcock's birds these things are lethal ) . Each scene of violence left me exhausted and willing to deal with the non exposition of the main plot ( okay its stupid I admit it ) . Worth a look for horror and action fans , though I'm not sure its really worth 10 bucks to see it .
428262	3079504	29712	6.0	Good and pretty much unknown adventure yarn	Conrad Veidt plays Gil De Berault , a duelist and rogue who occasionally helps Cardinal Richelieu ( Raymond Massey ) . Needing to have an opponent to the crown found and killed , Richelieu sends De Berault on a mission . However De Berault finds romance with his enemies sister and must find away to keep everyone , especially himself , alive . Veidt makes an odd swashbuckling hero . To be honest he may have been a bit too long in the tooth , but he still manages to give a good performance as man who knows his way around a sticky situation . His witty delivery and occasional bits of daring do make up for any short comings his age may have inferred . While far from perfect it is the sort of thing thats perfect at 1am when you can't sleep , though odds are you'll be like me and end up really past your bad time waiting for the no always certain conclusion .
428562	3079504	171824	6.0	Realistic account of the events in the big budget A Bridge Too Far is worth seeing simply because it shows the battle as it really was .	This is what we would now call a docudrama about the battle in and around Arnhem during the closing days of the Second World War . Mixing actual footage of the battle with new footage shot a year after the war in and around the ravaged city with many of the surviving soldiers playing themselves , this tells the same story that was told in the big Budget A Bridge Too Far . Its very much a you are there sort of film that pretty much seems to tell it like it was . I ran across this film in a budget collection of World War two films and since I'm a big fan of a Bridge Too Far I thought I'd pick it up . I'm not sure which is the better movie . One is a huge Hollywood financed production , the other is a small scale gritty in your face film that certainly shows what it must have been like . One I like because I like the story and the spectacle , the other I like because it shows what it was really like , and how Hollywood's version was too neat and clean . As good as this film is it has two problems in my eyes . First off its a bit disjointed . The film is telling the whole story about what happened in and around Arnhem and things get lost , " characters " blend into one another . Part of this seems to be the result of the fact that the film seems to have been dubbed after the fact and it seemed to me that several people have the same voice . Its not bad but I began to feel awash in the proceedings . The second problem with the film is that its awfully stereotypically " British " . Everyone is low key and even keeled . Everyone takes everything in stride , even the fact that they are surrounded with seemingly no way out . Its all greeted with a levelness that seems wildly out of the " ideal " notion of the British soldier rather than reality . The attitude is fine for a while , but buy the half way point into the film I was shaking my head and giggling at the calmness of it all . For me it severely detracted from the proceedings and left me feeling very disappointed . Flawed or not this is a must see , especially for those who like the later inflated epic film .
428007	3079504	293831	6.0	Good but unremarkable	Chinese action revenge drama has a group of crooks who steal from other crooks set up and shot up . Hunted by the cops and other crooks they set out to get revenge for the friends who were killed . Good but unremarkable film is the Chinese Crime equivalent to those movies you stumble upon on late night cable that hold your attention for their running time but disappear when they are over . You enjoy it while its on , but its not something you need to see it again . I liked it but I don't think I'll see it again . In that spirit you'll enjoy it if you run across it , but its not something you need search out . 6 .
428406	3079504	51706	6.0	Okay late Karloff can be a bit dull	Boris Karloff is a crusading novelist trying to change the British legal system by looking into the Haymarket Strangler case . Boris is convinced the man hung for the crime didn't do it . Of course his investigation turns up proof that he was right , and that he himself was the killer . Well made and well acted little thriller is on okay film to have on in the background . Recently released by Criterion as part of a 4 film set its an okay time killer best watched late at night . To be certain Karloff is wonderful to watch , especially in the scene where he finds the important piece of evidence which proves him right and also slides him into madness . However the mover isn't anything special and can be a bit dull ( too much music ) . ( The criterion commentary is excellent and the real reason to pick this up )
428293	3079504	443473	6.0	What kind of movie is this and what is is about ? This film can't make up its mind	WWE remakes running man by mixing it with Battle Royal as a bunch of convicts are dumped on an island for fight to the death on pay per view . What could have been good action film flounders under uneven direction , I don't mean the director is bad , I mean the film doesn't know where it wants to go . Is this a story of the people putting the show on or is it the convicts themselves . I don't hate the film I'm just disappointed in it if it had some sort of narrative vision . Yes the action is good but its undercut by the rest of the film . Worth a look when it plays cable or hits netflix .
428817	3079504	424823	7.0	Funny spoof of spy and martial arts movies is better on the small screen than it was on the big	Amusing comedy staring Dan Folger who won a Tony for the 25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee . The film concerns a Ping Pong Tournament run by madman Christopher Walken . A spoof of films like Enter the Dragon and everyone of those spy films where the FBI or CIA use a regular Joe for a secret mission this is an amusing romp I'm glad I didn't pay big bucks to see on the big screen . Don't get me wrong its a funny movie but not worth the 11 bucks it would take to see in a theater . Dan Folger clearly is a man of limited ability , He's okay here but its clear between this and Good Luck Chuck he's headed for a limited film and TV career in supporting roles . As I said he's good the role doesn't require him to do little more than mug at the camera and he's fine , but I doubt very much he'll be able to ever really do more than that . Christopher Walken on the other hand is a scream , and its clear why he took the role , he can go as far over the top as he wants and still be amusing . The rest of the cast including veteran James Hong and comedian George Lopez is up to snuff , though Maggie Q is given little to do other than look good . Absolutely worth seeing on both DVD and cable .
428612	3079504	929425	7.0	Haunting portrait of rampant crime in Italy	I saw Matteo Garrone's adaption of Roberto Saviano's best selling book on the criminal organization known as Cammora at the New York Film Festival . Telling five stories ( the book tells " hundreds " according to the director ) the film shows the effects of the criminal organization on life and lives . There is the story of a man who is burying toxic waste , a tailor who is approached by the Chinese to teach them how to sew , an older money man who delivers money to families in prison or worse ( this is a large story with many characters ) , the young kid getting in on the ground floor and the tale of two guys who think they can go it alone . Its a slice of life film that bounces between the stories making you wonder is it possible that they can't touch anywhere . The film borders on being a documentary with the sense that we are actually watching these characters go about their lives . Its a scary . There are explosions of violence that seem to come out of nowhere-and even when you know something is going to happen you still don't expect when it comes . I really liked the film a great deal . Clearly there are many stories to tell and if HBO wants to replace the Sopranos they might consider a miniseries adaption of the source . Forgive me its hard to really discuss the film because the film just sort of shows you the events with out really making a judgment . We don't take sides , we just see the world these people live in ( though its very clear that trying to be Tony Montana , as the two kids trying to go it alone are , will get you killed ) . The film's structure is such that you end up knowing faces not names and you don't always know right away which bit belongs with which story . Its very much a film like an immersion tank , the result is thrilling , off putting and a film that hangs with you and forces you to think deeply about what you've seen , more so because there are no easy answers . 7 . ( They really talked up the film before hand comparing it to La Dolce Vita , Open City and other classics of Italian film . It may have been too much and I reserve the right to readjust the rating later . Additionally once again the NYFF shows a film with white on white subtitles . How can we know what is going on when several scenes have white subtitles on white or light backgrounds - this was a source of grumbling many people around me when the film was done ) - - - Some 48 hours after the screening I find that I am still thinking about and meditating on it trying to find the words to describe it . ( And I keep tinkering with this comment ) the movie so maybe its better than I rated it .
427017	3079504	282039	7.0	The story of the men who fought in the Huertgen Forest .	Very good documentary hosted by both Tom Brokaw and Walter Cronkite about the coming together of soldiers , both American and German who fought against each other in the Huertgen Forest . Watching the men try to catch up after 50 years and try to explain and make sense of what happened is both touching and sad . The fighting was bad that one soldier could never have a Christmas tree because the smell of the tree reminded him of the battle . Its a trip . Its also one of the rare films that have sprung up in the last ten years or so where soldiers play witness , that doesn't seem clichéd . Its not just talking heads . Somehow it manages to be more . Worth a look see .
426905	3079504	39232	7.0	Good Late Late Show movie about pilots in the Great White North is the type of thing you'd stumble across and stay up all night watching	Red is a freight pilot somewhere in the North of Canada . He makes his living hauling freight by air all over the wilderness . He's a stand up guy in love with the local school teacher named Hillary . When Red's no good brother Paul comes North he starts up a competing business and tries moving in on Red's girl . Things get worse when Red's mechanic , and Hillary's brother , is killed in a plane crash . Hillary thinks its Red's fault . Will Red be able to win back his girl and put his brother in his place ? I guess you'll have to watch the movie and find out . This is a soapy melodrama about tough guys with a past fighting over business and a woman , but its a compelling movie that runs as long as it has to tell its story . Its small scale and efficient with some great scenery , some good performances and a plot that keeps you interested . Its the sort of thing that played in the wee hours of the Late Late Show after the main movies played but before the news or the farm report came on . The best thing that I can say is its the type of movie you'd stumble across on your way to bed and end up watching to the end ( and then have stuck in your head as you tried to figure out what the movie you just saw was because you missed the opening credits ) If you want a good , but not great , movie that will keep you interested for an hours entertainment , this is the film to get . Definitely worth a bag of popcorn .
427493	3079504	361089	7.0	British send up of WW2 films is a tad slow to start but is a funny feel good movie	Oh boy , Disney has their hands full with this one . . . a British animated and voiced film about World War Two with death , destruction and rude jokes . Oh , lets hope they don't cut the living hell out of this thing . This is the story of Valiant , a smaller than normal pigeon , who wants to join up with the Royal Carrier Pigeon Service . With the help of Bugsy , a con artist pigeon he accidentally saves , he manages to trick his way into the service . Training has barely begun when they are rushed off to France to bring back an important message . There Valiant , Bugsy and his squad come face to face with the evil falcon's who'd like nothing better than to make them lunch . A brief 75 minutes long ( reports of 109 minutes must be wrong ) this is a good send up of World War Two conventions . We have hateful Nazi falcons ( the leader is played evilly by Tim Curry ) ; the do or die mission ; Mom's tearful goodbye ; Edith Piaf on the gramophone , French resistance , balmy Brits ( two of which are John Cleese and John Hurt ) ; heroic sacrifice and on and on and on . The voice cast is excellent and any Anglophiles out there will want to see this for the great voice cast which includes Ewan McGregor as Valiant , who is a wonderful hero , Ricky Gervais as Bugsy who is hysterical as the slob friend , and then add in Hugh Laurie , Jim Broadbent , Curry , Cleese , Hurt and many others others bringing life to the birds on screen . The whole cast is fun to listen to . The humor is a wide net of British style humor from puns to fart jokes to clever spoof to just about anything . In its way its completely different than any typical American ( ie . Disney , Pixar , Dreamworks ) film . Its not broad American humor , its quiet British humor with slips into slapstick . Its a Britcom versus sitcom . Technically this film is a marvel with stuff that will put Disney to shame , and make Pixar and Dreamworks work harder . There are some beautifully rendered sequences , in particular the numerous action scenes . WOW . The problem here is the pacing which is a tad slow . It un-spools like a British World War Two film from the period . Its not bad but it might prove taxing to American audiences who are used to faster paced comedy . However once they go to France on the mission it picks up nicely with chase after chase . A friend asked if it was similar to Chicken Run , sort of . Both are Britsh war spoofs , but the style of humor is different and you don't have Mel Gibson bending it in the direction of American nonsense . Chicken Run is probably better but its hard to say fairly since I need to see Valiant again . Certainly not the be all and end all I do recommend it , especially if you like British style humor .
428771	3079504	435638	7.0	Enjoyable , but not great look at one of the movies ' great , but unknown , directors	Documentary portrait of the King of the B's . Ulmer worked primarily in the poverty row studios in America , after a starting in Europe in the 1920's . The work he turned out usually was looked better and played better than the rest of the films that the studios he worked for turned out . This is the man who gave us Detour ( a Noir classic ) , The Man from Planet X ( a scifi classic ) , Bluebeard ( John Carridines best film role ) and more than 50 other films that are more often than not better than they should be . This is a portrait of the man and not so much an over view of his career . If you want to know about of his films you'll have to use this merely as a start since the amount of information contained isn't a lot . The story is told by the people who knew him , his daughter , and the actors and actresses who worked with him ; as well as those who admired him directors Wim Wenders , Roger Corman , Joe Dante and John Landis , and his biographers including Peter Bogdanovich . Its an good portrait of the man as a workaholic trying to turn out enough work for hire to get by . You also get a sense of the mystery of the man . Here's a man who may or may not have reinvented his early film career , and told Bogdanovich and others how he was simply happy making films his way , all the while trying to get back into the big studios ( Ulmer appears to have been blacklisted almost at the start for running off with the wife of one of the heads of Universal Studios ) . The style of the film has almost everyone riding or pretending to ride in a car while being interviewed . Its done in such away as to make it look like several of the people interviewed are talking to each other , so its cut so that Dante and Landis are in the same car , talking to each other . I'm not sure the interviews were done that way but it does create some interesting imaginary conversations . I liked the film a great deal and it caused me to bring out some of Ulmer's movies to take a look at them once again . Worth a look for film fans and people who just want to know a bit about one of the movies unsung heroes .
427726	3079504	182882	7.0	Good action movie is brought to you by the tobacco growers of turkey	I have never seen so much smoking in one movie in my life . Even having seen a good number of Turkish films where smoking seems to be a way of life this film takes the case , or the smoke . Geeze , find a dead body have a smoke . Look at a corpse have a smoke . Almost get beaten up by a man with chains on his hands , bum a smoke from the poor guy . I think I may have gotten lung cancer just from watching this thing . All kidding aside this is a very good action film starring Cüneyt Arkin , one of my new favorite actors . Arkin is a doctor who moonlighted as an actor . Think of him as a cross between Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris , and probably able to beat the crap out of both of them . The plot of this film has Arkin investigating the death of the daughter of a friend of his . ( I think this is the case since I saw this in Turkish without any English ) . The girl had some how gotten involved in prostitution and porn and was killed for her trouble . Arkin runs roughshod over the bad guys , kicking a few butts in the process of trying to track down which slime-ball was responsible . Arkin also has to deal with his friend who insists on getting involved as a result of a personal vendetta . The action is well done ( though it gets very silly at the end ) and the plot is interesting . As Arkin films go its not at the top of the heap but its close . I'm sure that had I been able to understand the dialog I would have enjoyed it more . If you're new to the films of Turkey and of the work of Cüneyt Arkin and feel adventurous you may want to give it a try with the understanding that this is middle of the road Arkin . if you've run across Arkin and his brand of action before and liked what you saw give it a try , this is basically more of the same . If you're not up to trying something new take a pass and wait for one of the other better Arkin films to come your way .
428022	3079504	906665	7.0	Mostly brilliant merging of samurai and gunfighters as Takashi Miike takes back the genre Sergio Leone took to Italy	Takashi Miike makes a samurai movie as a western . The Japanese cast speaks in English , the music is eclectic with strong spaghetti western influences , and the material is referential and full of homage and send up . It begins with a Quentin Tarantino cameo , then switches to the story of two clans fighting over the supposed treasure in a small town . Into the stand off rides a stranger with no name . Forgive the brevity , but if you've seen any number of spaghetti westerns then you've probably seen something like this story that spins out here . The tale of gold lust and warring factions isn't anything new . What is new is how Miike dresses it up . Clearly the Japanese could make a western if the wanted to . Its a clever re-imagining of the genre and is interesting enough to warrant at least a brief look see . The problem with the film is that its 30 to 45 minutes too long . A very good first half hour gives way to long exposition in the middle hour , and while there are some genuinely nice moments its a little too plodding as it tries to cover one cliché too many . The film then picks up in the final 40 minutes with a huge shoot out . Its a schizo movie at times as things just go on and on . However when the film works - which it does at the ends and for a chunk of the middle , this is some of the best film making I've seen this year so far . The characters , the action , some set pieces are simply stunning , not to mention touching , there are several moments of real emotion . And make no mistake , this is a spaghetti western , and the film is a bit more fun if you know the genre . For example the Django in the title will alert anyone who's seen the Franco Nero film of Django what is inside the coffin that is dragged around . You don't need the know the genre but it will help you identify what they are stealing from . for the mixed up and down nature of the film . Probably the only one who could have pulled this off was Miike and he did it wonderfully .
428217	3079504	39743	7.0	One of the so bad its good flicks	A woman tries to locate her fiance who is missing somewhere in the jungle . This is a movie to make strong men go slack jawed and wide eyed . At least half its running time is stock footage only some of which matches the studio shot footage ( or even other bits of stock footage ) . The narration is so out of touch with reality as to make one wonder was the author in on the script meetings . Its truly an amazing film . To give you an idea , the film begins with the search starting in India , for no logical reason . It then switches to Africa and goes on from there , where bits of plot from India come into play , like the native uprising in India affecting the natives in the African Jungle , or the shadowy presence trying to stop the search . At least it moves . There's good action , and the actors are game if nothing else . Is it worth watching ? Yes . The film at least is trying to do something for its running time . Inept film making aside the only flaw is a long passage toward the end where its just people talking . It doesn't last long and before long there's a great big fight . On the purely enjoyable scale I give it . Perfect for a rainy day when you want to laugh at something .
427482	3079504	35448	7.0	Wild	Oh boy , what a wild movie this is . Any movie that begins with a nonchalant battle in a fancy dining room and goes from there has to be seen to be believed . The plot has something to do with a rich , but corrupt man killed for a valuable necklace ( it was the reason for the opening fight ) . Framed for the murder is the love of the rich man's wife who had been sent off to the wilds in the hope that he would be killed . The widow of course sides with her love and what transpires after that is the movie . Over the top nonsense is a bit of fun in the " I can't believe everything that's going on " sort of way . Best of all its amusing beyond the disbelief with some intriguing characters . And if nothing else its one of the few times a certain cliché about who's behind it all is at least partly right .
426789	3079504	296242	7.0	Entertaining look at the stars of Chinese martial arts films	Good martial arts movie over view that is a good mix of interviews , narration and fight clips . The film gives some background on the history of martial arts in China before moving on to a loose overview of martial arts on film . Focusing on the various stars that have emerged in the genre over the years the film is arranged approximate ( but not complete ) order in which an actor rose to prominence . The interviews are with people like Gordon Liu , Jackie Chan , Jim Kelly , Bruce Li and other stars whose clips we see as they talk about making movies . There is also a long segment on Bruce Lee where former students are interviewed . Entertaining , this film compliments nicely some of the better films on the subject Cinema of Vengeance and IFC film on Kung Fu films by fleshing out some of the people only touched on in those documentaries , as well as showing lots of extended film clips of action sequences that are actually worth watching . Worth keeping an eye out for , especially since it can be found in bargain DVD bins for under five bucks .
428751	3079504	985699	7.0	If only I could have forgotten how it was going to end I would have thought this one of the best of the year	Bryan Singers film about the plot to kill Hitler is a very good one . ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Wonderfully acted , especially when it gets going , it has one of the best ensemble casts I've seen . This is beautiful to look at with a real sense of being in the Nazi world . And it is at times a taut film about a plot to kill the Fuhrer ( I know you can all here the " but " coming , so I won't disappoint you ) BUT the film has one large problem , we know how it turns out . Forgive me for saying that unless you really don't know your history you know the plan fails and everyone dies . Short of them rewriting history there is one and only one way this can go , and its not really a happy one . This doesn't mean there is no tension , there is , it just means there are no surprises except in the details . For me the films inability to transcend the fact we know it ends badly keeps it from being a being a great film and instead making it only a good one . Its is possible to make a great film about a failed event , one need only look at Khartoum or the Alamo to see two films that hold you in such away that you forget the ending . Don't get me wrong its a good film , I just wish they had made me forget the ending at the start . ( Counter point recent films where I knew the ending and didn't care or forgot it in the flow : Milk , Che , Frost / Nixon )
428405	3079504	51542	7.0	Good thriller	Another from the Criterion Madmen and Monsters set . Here Boris Karloff is a doctor trying to find away to end pain during surgery . Regrettably he becomes addicted to his drugs and all sorts of havoc ensues . Better in many way than the co feature Haunted Strangler , this boasts a super performance from Christopher Lee . The problem is that this is tough going when viewed close to the Haunted Strangler since in some ways its more of the same ( which isn't too far off since the films were made somewhat back to back ) . Watching them back to back , as one is prone to do with double feature sets I found my attention wandering , which is very unfair because this is a good movie . Heavily censored upon initial release this is a dark and cold film where everyone appears to be on the make or damaged in someway . ( The cut material is included as an extra in the Criterion set ; which also has an excellent commentary ) . I really do like the movie , I only wish I had watched it spaced days apart from its co feature not minutes .
428637	3079504	304711	7.0	Actually quite good if you give yourself over to it	This should have retained the title Sineater since thats more to the point of what the film is about . This is one of those movies that shows signs of being tinkered with , mostly in that chunks of it don't make sense , or a sense that seems to have been cut out . Basically the film has Heath Ledger as a priest going to Rome to investigate the death of the head of his order . Its more complicated than that , and for a good chunk of it , it doesn't make sense , not that it ever fully does . Frankly for good or bad this film is going to stay with me for a long time . Its not what ever it was advertised as , its an occult mystery thats closer to the Club Dumas , the source of the Johnny Depp movie , the 9th Gate , than to a conventional horror film . I like the film . Its very flawed but its interesting enough and raises some good questions about salvation and the church . If you want to try something different , and don't mind that its not perfect , I say try this . ( forgive me there is an urge to wax poetic about bits of it . . . )
428750	3079504	465430	7.0	Funny , gory crime horror hybrid makes you dread what may happen next	Two brothers kidnap the daughter of a mafia don and take her to cottage in the country . Once there things begin to go horribly wrong and it isn't long before everyone has met the neighbor - the local maniac . Jet black crime horror comedy that stars Andy Serkis ( why isn't he getting bigger roles in bigger movies ? ) that is very funny and very unpleasant . Decidedly over the top this is a film that sends up the conventions of both crime and horror films with equal skill to create an evil hybrid . The problem is that it creates a real tension that is almost to the point where you don't want to watch the film . Not so much that its bad , rather its that even as your laughing whats happening is so uncomfortable you can't watch . Its the cinematic equivalent to comedic cruelty where one person just keeps having bad things happen to them even though they don't deserve it . Granted here the people are crooks , but at the same time you like them enough you don't like to see them stabbed or chopped up . Did I mention its a bloody film ? If you don't like blood or violence look elsewhere . I don't know if I like the film , but at the same time it really is well done and if you like this sort of thing you may want to give it a try .
426967	3079504	29240	7.0	Taught tight tale of reporters investigating big business starting a war for profit	Cabal of armament manufacturers conspire to wreck a peace conference and start a war for profit and personal reasons . Standing in their way is a pair of newspaper reporters who stumble upon the plot when a fellow reporter is killed to prevent him telling all . Very good fast moving thriller that feels some of the German crime films from the lat 1920's merged with British thrillers of the period . Its almost Hitchcockian in many ways and one could easily imagine the great director directing it himself . The plot is slightly science fictiony with radio controlled planes and large machines but they are merely window dressing as hero and heroine try to get to the bottom of the plot . While not quite perfect its is a nice dark little thriller perfect for a rainy night .
428973	3079504	86636	7.0	Good little thriller you've probably not heard of but should see	They call it a zombie movie but its not really . Its a creepy little thriller . The plot of this film has a guy running down what was previously typed on a typewriter ( he looked at the ribbon to see what the person before typed ) and ends up dropped in the middle of a rather strange mystery about places where time stops and the dead come back . . . I had read about this in the Italian Zombie movie book and was intrigued . When I happened upon it used at a cheap price I picked it up . It was a good purchase . This is a film with no real gore . Its a film that builds through atmosphere and through twisting circumstances . Its one of those movies that makes you feel uneasy . You know it doesn't make sense but you have to keep watching because there is something about the internal logic that demands it , you watch it even though your skin is crawling and you're shifting uneasily in your chair . No its not the best horror film ever made , but its a damn good one . One I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who wants a decent thriller . Trust me , as some one some what versed in and tired of what is called typical Italian horror , ie films that make no sense and which are very gory , Zeder is a breath of fresh air . If you're in the mood for something off beat and unexpected in your horror films I'd say rent Zeder , you could do a hell of a lot worse . . . And for those pondering the Pet Semetary angle . . . both this film and Stephen King's book appeared at about the same time
427704	3079504	166813	7.0	As good as it is this movie annoys me	( These are my thoughts after seeing Spirit in the movies right after it was released ) This movie annoys me . Okay let me back up - - - TWO AND HALF STARS-moments of it are much better . I liked it . Understand that ? I like the film . Where was I ? Oh yea , annoyed me . Why does this movie exist ? Its too long by a half an hour , mostly because its so leisurely . This is a YA book done by Cliff Notes . It got the feel of a Scholastic book brought to life . Not that its bad , it just is so bland . There are great sequences , some of the fort sequence , a lot of the Indian village stuff is all quite good . What has me snackered is that this should have been better . It should have been tighter . Say what you will about Disney films , they would not have made such a rambling film . I am a vocal critic of Disney and its product but I know , in my heart that this wouldn't have been as loose as it is if Disney had done it . Of course we would have had to suffer through talking horses but thats not the point there would have been more meat to this . Why I find it truly bothersome is that because its so loose I found the film much more bitter sweet than its meant to be simply because I could fill in the history of what happens and how things were pointless , the railroad was built , the horses were rounded up and the Indians died , despite the happy ending of the film . I shouldn't have had time to think about that . What also irks me is the mix of computer and regular animation . They spent how much on this and its painfully obvious what is what . It wouldn't have been bad if say they computer stuff had been allowed to be seen as computer animation when it came to humans , or the railway camp ( which except for the train wreck , works ) but its not and I was was watching the melding of the two styles while shaking my head . A lot of it remind me of the truly awful hell sequence from the live action Spawn . Couldn't They have paid someone from Japan to come and sort it out . I mean you were stealing shots from things like ' Night on the Galactic Railway ' or ' Spring and Chaos ' for the train sequences anyway . ( and don't tell me its not stolen and that you can only do it so many way , baloney , they borrowed . ) Whats worse , is that other than making money I see no point to this movie having been made . None . Zippo . Nada . I don't say that about many movies even when I despise them but to me this is a completely pointless movie from top to bottom . Its at best a 45 minute story stretched to almost 90 minutes . And while it doesn't lag , I wished that something unpredictable and truly exciting had occurred for more than thirty seconds at a pop . I do have to say that this is a wonderful proof that you don't need talking animals to have a good movie . ( I said I liked it , I just want BETTER ) The melding of music and image to tell the story is wonderful and I think its the music that makes several of the soaring moments , even if at times even that is a bit clunky . You also have to give points to a movie that begins with the birth of a horse , tastefully done on screen . Disney would have had kittens with that . Forgive me for ripping the movie apart , but it should have been better than good . There are flashes of great here and they deserve a better frame than this . Truthfully if Disney and Dreamworks had done this together it would have been better - - - assuming that they could have both used their strengths . See it at some point , you'll like it , and you'll probably be annoyed it isn't better . You know what it is , I wanted a movie I would remember and not one that slips from memory as one is writing a review .

Billed in English as on of the " Sons of Hercules " films this is really the story or Perseus and his run in with the hydra . The legend was the basis for Clash of the Titans and was some of the last work by Ray Harryhausen . Given the choice between watching that all star yawner and this film I'll take this one every time . No , its not great , but its straight forward and honest in trying to do nothing more than entertain . Knowing that any film with Hercules in the title is nothing more than mental popcorn helps get through the rough spot , which this film has mostly avoided .
428388	3079504	281718	8.0	Hard edged story of friendship over the course of 20 years is must see viewing	Friend This is the course of friendship over a twenty year period . Beginning in 1975 we watch as four friends spend some time on what appears to be a summer vacation . Their future looks bright . A few years on as school and life takes its toll the dynamic between them changes and re-changes again as the have to deal with growing up , shattered dreams , decent into crime and drugs and the friendship itself . This is a dark little film that reminded me of some of the work of Martin Scorsese . Life often beats on these guys , from cruelty from their teachers to murder making it hard to get by . The course of these boys lives is not clear nor does it always turn out how we , or they think it will . The cast is excellent from top to bottom . Definitely worth seeking out , though be warned some of the violence has a tough edge to it .
428785	3079504	118694	8.0	A Beautiful Looking Love Story	This movie is one of the most technically perfect films ever made . Its sense of time and place oozes off the screen . We are there watching the lives of two neighbors . The performances by everyone are dead nuts perfect and in an age of over or under acting by most of the acting community the two leads stand out as shining examples of how to be real on screen . The trouble with this movie is that its oblique . Its the tale of two people who meet and learn that their spouses are having an affair . The story is told mostly through short screens that highlight a moment and slowly build into something , the question is what . I reached the end of the film and was left wondering if I had missed something , it was very good but I wasn't certain what it was about . Looking at the Criterion DVD things became even more confused when I looked at the deleted scenes which alter the nature of the movie . Don't get me wrong . I like the movie , but I'm not certain it amounts to much in the end . . . then again I could be wrong , I need to see this again . If you want to see perfect acting with two performances that arc electricity then by all means see this movie . Just be warned that it may leave you wondering what it was all about in the end .
428055	3079504	386064	8.0	Damning indictment of the cost of war	When North Korea invades the South , two brothers are forcibly drafted into the army . The older of the two , hoping to win a medal and ticket home for his younger brother , begins going on every suicide mission offered . This , however , puts a strain on his relationship with his brother and those in the platoon . Worse the course of the war has several nasty turns waiting for them . . . I'm of two minds about this film . Despite the fact this is a graphic example of both the physical and psychic effects of war , the narrative is more than a bit disjointed . The film is loosely connected snapshots of the course of the war , beginning right before the invasion , then several weeks later before jumping about a month at a time to certain key events . I'm sure that had I better grasp of the history of the war I would have understood the events better . I felt lost and wished there had been more explanation . The lack of a narrative that follows all the way from start to finish hurts the film since we're moved a bit too much from place to place and situation to situationBut the course of the war is not the purpose of the film , rather its the relationship between two brothers . How war changes them and everything in and around them except the love they have for each other . Its a bit hokey but its dead on , just ask anyone who's ever loved their sibling unquestioningly . You understand how one brother would spend 50 years trying to find the other . And then there are the battle scenes which are wonderful and frightening and seem to be the total chaos that war really is . People die horribly and the experience is far from fun . Is the movie worth seeing ? Yes . Its not perfect but its a kick in the pants . .
428908	3079504	386065	8.0	Trippy murder mystery about the nature of reality	I'm a fan of director Oshii's animated works but for the most part I'm left scratching my head by his live action works . For the most part I find his live action films interesting doodles that don't add up to very much . Then again he surprised me with Talking Head , a very existential and surreal look at not only film making but also the notions of reality . The plot has to do with a producer of an upcoming animated movie bringing in hired gun director to take over for the previous director who is long gone taking the script and anything remotely connected to the movie with him . Faced with having to make a film in two months the director sets about to work only to find that some one or something is killing off his crew . However the plot isn't really the point as the film spins off in various directions as it pulls apart our notions of reality , movies , stories , and numerous other subjects . Its feast for your mind assuming you like ideas over action . Not for all tastes , this is head-trip film and if you don't like that sort of thing look elsewhere . Its very much like Heart of Darkness in an anime studio . I really liked this film a great deal . Its not perfect , bouncing around too much for my tastes but it scores high in my book simply because it dares to be about ideas .
428002	3079504	1119194	8.0	Wonderful	Shuhei Amamiya son of a famous concert pianist transfers with his mother to a school in the country so his mom can take care of his grandmother .

Magical story of following your heart and finding ones " piano " .

These are real people trying to get along in life , and deal with school , friendship and a competition where one has to wonder is being technically perfect when other people feel things so much more . I don't know what to say . . . its a really good film . It makes you feel good . Its not perfect but you really won't care . For a good chunk of it the film didn't need to be animated until things become magic and take off . . You really want to see this if for no other reason you'll find out why Kai become Wendy to the confusion of a good number of people . This film needs a wide release so lots of people can find their own piano . somewhere around
428294	3079504	390849	8.0	Good look at an off beat character	The life and work of Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki . Mostly known for his erotic or perhaps pornographic photos its clear from this film that there is more to the man than just dirty pictures . Coming a cross as a charming rogue its clear that Araki loves what he's doing , which is photographing everyone and everything at all times . There is a comment by one of his fellow photographers to the effect that Araki is more than his erotic pictures and that there is nothing that he doesn't know about photography . Seeing his images whizzing by in the film its clear the statement is true as we see the vast range of his work that stretches from the mundane to flowers to portraits to porn to whatever else you can think of . He's an amazing man that I'm certain will worm his way into the hearts of anyone who sees the film . If there is a flaw to the film its perhaps its rapid fire , hip and happening style , which may capture Araki's manic energy , but some how short changes some of the images ( and ideas ) since many are too good to let get lost
428449	3079504	83100	8.0	One of the best Holmes adaptations	Russian TV version of the story that was filmed as part of a series and then released elsewhere as a stand alone film . For the most part an excellent adaption of the story with a real genuine chemistry and warmth between Homes and Watson that would seem to predate the Jermey Brett series . This feels the way the stories should feel . If there are any flaws in the film it would be that Henry Baskerville is not English raised in North America rather he's decidedly Russian in manner , The moors , while very ominous-possibly the most in any adaptation-are not quite England and the last " flaw " is that the film is overly faithful to the story and runs two and a half hours . They are minor flaws and should not keep you from watching one of the better Holmes films made .
427228	3079504	785077	8.0	Sue me I liked it	A really good ( no seriously its good ) story about a rapper who wants to join a country club but its snotty board ( headed by Jeffrey Jones ( Ferris Beuller's nemesis ) refuse to let him in . Buying a property close to the 17th hole he leverages it into membership and well what happens is the movie . Neither cartoony nor really over the top ( okay just a bit ) this is a movie where everyone ( mostly ) behaves like real people . Actually one of the key points is that the hero is a better person then the jerks running the country club . Clearly made by film makers who didn't work for " the man " who would have the rappers as gangsters or clowns , this is a nice comedy that makes one wonder who was in the board room the day this was green lit since its so atypical Hollywood on almost every level . recommended on cable if not as a rental .
428468	3079504	30174	8.0	Excellent Edgar Wallace adaption will keep you guessing until the end	Adaptation of Edgar Wallace's " The Ringer " is a nifty little thriller . Boasting not only a neat little mystery it also has a game cast that sells the story . The plot has a well known criminal lawyer is threatened by a master criminal known as the Ringer . The lawyer is not worried since the Ringer is believed to have died in Sydney Australia . However he begins to worry when he finds out that the flowers bearing the threat were ordered from a ship coming from Sydney . The Ringer it seems wants to exact revenge for the death of his sister who committed suicide because of the attorney . Add to the mix the police , Scotland yard , the wife of the Ringer , and several crooks who had dealing with the attorney's fencing operation and you have a movie where anyone could be the killer . I really liked this thriller . An Ealing film , this film is clearly a kin to the later series of comedies that starred Alec Guinness . While most definitely not a comedy , it does have some very witty lines , solid performances and sharpness of construction of the sort that made the later films classics . I liked that every character , no matter how inconsequential makes an impression on you . Every cop , every passerby , every speaking part major and minor is a real person . When someone walks on screen you have a sense that this could be happening . The script is filled with great exchanges between characters . The police surgeon has a wonderful way of putting people down or inferring he may know more than he is letting on . The jailbird , sprung because he knows what the Ringer looks like turns in some hysterical remarks in his vein attempt just to be sent back to prison where its safe . The construction of the plot is better than most mysteries of the time . Its understandable why the source novel was used at least five times for movies . Its nice that the film is done in such a way that even though you may guess or suspect who the killer is , you will still harbor doubts until the final denouncement . There are enough plot-lines running through this story ( all adequately explained ) that its not easy to piece together everything thats going on at first glance . Better still its done in such away that you're engaged waiting for the next clue to pop up , there are no dead spots as the detectives wait to be moved to the next piece , things are always happening . One of the better mysteries I've seen , this is heartily recommended for anyone who wants a good mystery with character . Though I have to ask , if anyone figures out what the title means could you please let me know . since it seems to have been chosen at random to cover the source novel .
427035	3079504	439630	8.0	Chinese adaptation of a Japanese comic is not you typical race film . Probably will play better if you don't know the source and are open to different take in a race film	Takumi is a high schooler who often delivers his fathers tofu late at night . His late night trips have made him adept at the winding down hill run of Mt . Akina , which is a course used by the street racers of the area as the ultimate test of skill . When an unintentional race brings him to the notice of the racers , his life changes as he has to field numerous offers to actually see who is the best driver . Based on a Japanese comic and cartoon , Initial D is a live action Chinese film thats broken box office records across Asia . Despite being a huge animation fan I've never seen the animation nor have a I read the comic . I'm not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing , but seeing how many fans of the source material are unhappy with the film I would say its a good thing . Flat out I liked this movie . It did take a while to warm up to , but once I began to take it for what it is I thoroughly enjoyed it . Is it a great film ? In someways yes and in others no . As I said this takes a bit to get going . The lead is a bit too closed mouth for my taste , barely uttering a word for the entire two hours . Its a bit too teen angsty . Still you have great characters and great performances by pretty much everyone in the cast ( even if everyone was speaking three or four different languages when this was filmed . The racing is excellent . Its mostly seems to have been done with out CGI enhancement . I like that there are no horrific crashes , police chases or other clichéd events that are so rampant in American movies . And while I was initially apprehensive by the fact the racing is always on the same stretch of road , I warmed to the idea since by doing that we really got to see who was best . ( If you want American style racing in many different environments stay away ) Definitely worth a look see , especially if you want to see a race film that is not like all of the rest . 7 . rounded up to for IMDb purposes .
428866	3079504	768114	8.0	Heart breaking tale of a father , a son and a two broken hearts	I watched the complete restored directors cut which runs two hours and forty minutes some forty minutes longer than the theatrical cut . I had picked the film up because the description on the DVD case promised one thing , however how it delivered that story was not what I expected . ( I also picked it up because I love the English title ) As the film opens boy is being sent off to school by his mother . She is being especially nice to him and he suspects something is wrong . sneaking off the bus he returns home to find his mother packing up her things preparing to leave him and his father . He runs off to tell his dad , who returns home in time to stop her from leaving . He manages to talk her into staying , but it isn't for long as his mother eventually leaves leaving him and his father alone to take on the world , and the money men he owes money to from his out of control gambling . Heartbreaking tale of two souls adrift in life's storms is compelling viewing . The performances by everyone involved especially Aaron Kwok as the father are very real and emotional . Its painful at times looking into the lives of these people . They are not good or bad , they are just people which is readily apparent when Kwok , his wife having just left him , breaks down on the couch grasping desperately at his son pleading with him not to leave him too . its a heavy moment . Actually the movie is full of heavy moments , many of them that rung true with me having lived through similar ones with parents and friends . The film is technically a marvel with a look that is stunning , as is the use of the widescreen . Even better is the use of music both in its original score and its use of songs from elsewhere . Patrick Tam who directed is also listed as music designer , a title I've never heard of before but which is aptly put in the present case . If the film has a flaw its that in this cut its a bit too long . As I said earlier this is forty minutes longer than the theatrical version which must move at a better clip . However I would be remiss in not saying I really couldn't tell you what I would cut to speed the film up , or if I did have an idea I certainly wouldn't know where to cut forty minutes . On a more personal note I was slightly disappointed in the very end of the movie . There is something about it that left me unsatisfied . I suspect because it doesn't provide an end rather a stop . its a minor thing that I can't explain , but its what prevented me from completely falling head over heels with the film , something I felt sure I was going to do . Don't get me wrong this is a really good movie , its just the last second of film just made me go " wha ? " . Frankly I'm going to have to watch the final portion of the film to see if it makes a difference on a second viewing .
427641	3079504	443701	8.0	More mediation on forgiveness and salvation as opposed to mystery with a central character many will despise on principle	Stand alone X-Files film has split critics down the middle with half loving it and half hating it . I really liked it . The plot has an FBI agent going missing and the FBI being contacted by a psychic ex-priest . Uncertain what to make of him the FBI asks Scully , now working as a pediatric doctor , to contact Mulder with the promise of clearing his name . Mulder takes the case and then things go off in unexpected directions . I think the thing thats angering people is that the film is not so much a mystery-which it is-rather its a mediation on belief and redemption . Billy Connolly's Father Joe is pedophile ( another reason people hate the film ) who desperately wants forgiveness . His visions are a curse and something he is unsure of . Adding layers is Scully who is trying to save the life a young boy in the Catholic hospital where she practices-a hospital that wants her to give up and let the boy die . Scully hates Father Joe because of his past , but is uncertain what his visions mean , especially when he says something simple to her . In someways its constructed as little more than a bumped up episode , but at the same time the film is dealing some heavy issues . I highly doubt that Father Joe ever would have been allowed to be on the series . The fact that its self contained means that Chris Carter can actually mediate on the ideas he's presenting giving the film a weight I doubt any episode ever had . I have to admire Carter for making one of the more thoughtful American films of the year wrapping it in the cloth of a TV show movie . I would love to know what he might have done with the show had he been able to do things like this with it . Ideas aside the film isn't perfect . As I said it plays at times like an episode of the series and the mystery is often pushed aside for weighty matters . Still even with out the notions of salvation the mystery is wonderfully ghoulish and intriguing while the Mulder Scully relationship is fun . I think its worth seeing-perhaps not at full price-but certainly for a bargain matinée or on DVD . ( less if you don't like the discussion of salvation involving a pedophile priest )
428939	3079504	71396	8.0	Don't let the fact that the people behind Howard the Duck made this movie scare you away , this is one creepy little movie that will haunt you	This is a creepy creepy film . Its part HP Lovecraft , part Night of the Living Dead , part Cabinet of Dr Caligari . The plot has a woman recounting the tale of why she is in an asylum . The story begins with the woman going to find out what happened to her estranged father . They had communicated with letters , however as time went on they got stranger and stranger before stopping . Even before she arrives in the town she runs into some decidedly odd behavior , once there things get completely crazy with the dead coming back to life and all hell breaking loose . I was hesitant to try this movie because because the people behind Howard the Duck made it , but I was pleasantly surprised , this is a scary film . Essentially the ravings of a " mad " woman this movie manages to walk the fine line between real and unreal in such away that you get sucked into her story and are left wondering at the end if its real or not . Either way I was let creeped out and had to put on a light comedy in the hopes of making it so I could go to bed . In someways I'd have to put this on the list of great forgotten horror movies of the 1970's . It isn't perfect . The opening song is very odd choice , effective in some ways , but odd . Its suffers from a certain cheap almost amateur feel that many b-films from the period had . They take away , ever so slightly from the sense of dread especially when you've seen as many of these things as I have . Flaws or no this is really worth seeing , preferably not when you're all alone late at night since it will leave you with a creeping sense of unease that will make bed a scary place to be .
428035	3079504	486822	8.0	Very good	Really good version of Rear Window where a kid on house arrest realizes that his neighbor is a serial killer . While not scary as such ( you can pretty much guess where this is going to go because it is by the numbers ) this is a nice thrill ride that will keep you watching to the end . You like the kid and his friends and can sympathize with his plight . If there is a flaw its that the film could almost be a well made TV movie , there really is no reason this needed to be seen on the big screen ( other than the attention a genuinely good thriller would attract ) . Still this is worth seeing though I'd wait for a bargain matinée or a rental on a rainy Saturday night once it comes out on DVD .
428677	3079504	292963	8.0	Sins of the sons lay waste to everything around them	Greek tragedy of operatic proportions as two brothers looking for quick money decided to rob a mom and pop Jewelry store-their mom and pop's . Almost unbearable decent into darkness as we see the event and then bounce between the days prior and after from various points of view . This is a world of flawed people in which its hard to root for anyone . Its a road accident of a tale and you can't look away as the sins of the sons leave destruction visited on their father and everyone else in the of a really bad idea wake . Philip Seymour Hoffman is quite good as the slimeball brother who sets it all in motion in the hope of making some quick cash . Ethan Hawk is just okay as the brother who knows its wrong but goes with it anyway ( Hawks problem is that its too mannered . or affected . I should have been more on his side but instead found myself distanced ) . An excellent movie filled with darkness that maybe a bit too intense and too dark for some viewers ( and even reviewers who rated it highly but left it off the best of the year lists ) . I'm finding it rattling around in my head , its bleak look making me admire it more than I like it . Liking it to me somehow meaning that I'd actually want to see this again , which I'm not sure I'd want to do ( and not wanting to dwell on the details is keeping me from discussing the film the way it should be discussed ) . Grand film-making from Sidney Lumet . Probably one of the years best ( - reduced to for IMDb purposes because I don't know if I need to see this again )
426914	3079504	132118	9.0	Excellent early alternate Charlie Chan	One of the few Chan movies to actually be based on one of the original novels this is essentially the start of the series of movies that many people know and love so well . The story was later shortened and reused as Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise . This was shot at the same time as an alternate Spanish version of the now lost Charlie Chan Carries On , and is an excellent take on the great detective . The plot begins in London where a friend of Chan's , an Inspector Duff , is called in to investigate the murder of one of a travel group touring the world . It transpires that one of the group is not who they say they are and is out for revenge of a past wrong . Two more murders follow as the group continues the tour , but still there is no sign of the killer . When events in China put another member of the party in danger , Duff is forced to act and he races to Hawaii to see his old friend Charlie Chan to ask his help with the case before the party leaves . While visiting Chan in his office Duff is shot down . Chan feeling an obligation to his fallen friend tells the medics who rush Duff to the hospital to tell his friend that " Charlie Chan carries on " . Chan joins the party as they board a ship for San Fransisco , vowing to either solve the murder by the time they arrive or retire if he hasn't . ( The appearance of Chan is half way into the movie , and its the point at which Murder Cruise begins ) . This is a really good little movie and its understandable why a series sprang from it . Even though Chan doesn't show up for a good while into the proceeding , he hangs over the film since Duff is constantly quoting things that his friend Chan might say . The mystery is tightly plotted and keeps you on the edge of your seat . Its so well done that I didn't mind not seeing Chan in action and found myself actually wishing for a series of films with Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard . Manuel Arbó is a great Chan . A very physical actor he moves and does things that Warner Oland , and the other actor's playing Chan rarely did , he got on his knees to detect , rifles through drawers and actually does hands on investigating . Chan is also a very clearly two men . Outwardly he is the quiet font of Chinese wisdom that most people feel they can under estimate . Inwardly and when he is in the hunt he is a man of action who knows what has to be done and how to do it . Watch how he searches a room , or in the final reel sets the trap for the killer . He moves in a way that none of the other Chans ever did . He is not just a man of words , but a man of action who is very clearly in control of what is going on . Arbo is made to look physically like Oland , no doubt to use shots from the other version , however there is something more commanding about his presence . You are very aware of his presence in a scene , even when he is on the out skirts of it . I would love to have seen how the series would have played out had Arbo been allowed to play the detective . ( Perhaps what makes this film so great is that it doesn't follow the the pattern of the series ) . This is a movie to search out . If you can find it somewhere by all means do see it . There is an English subtitled version floating around if you don't speak Spanish ( This may carry the English translation of the title They Were Thirteen ) . Even if you are not a Charlie Chan fan this is just a really good mystery . This is the sort of thing that people don't make any more , it feels like a movie you'll want to curl up with on a dark a stormy night .
427605	3079504	293662	9.0	Great Popcorn action film , is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time .	I love this movie . I've seen it I don't know how many times since its release and I never seem to get tired of it . The plot is simple . Frank is man who will transport anything anywhere so long as you follow his rules . For Frank the rules are what keeps him safe and out of trouble . Of course Frank breaks one of the rules and he suddenly find himself on the run with a girl in tow with police and the bad guys on his tail . This film has great characters who say very funny things , the exchanges between Frank and the police officer name Taconi is wonderfully funny and knowing . It has incredible action the likes of which you've probably never seen , the opening chase is one of the best ever put on film , and o course the battle in the oil . Its a wonderful film that completely falls apart dramatically in the second half . Once Frank and the girl come face to face with the two bad guys , the film ceases to make logical sense . Whats going on ( apparently a plot to smuggle Chinese into France , though its not really clear ) is less important than getting Frank to the next action scene . Whats so troubling is that even after 30 or 40 viewings it feels like the film makers never had a clear direction past a certain point in the story . Its not fatal , but it is annoying . Plot collapse or no , this is a great film that really should be seen . Its just two hours of good fun , and great times . ( Besides it sets you up for the sequel , which in many ways is better than this , even though it too has plot problems )
427921	3079504	64068	9.0	The search for love , identity and place in a Tokyo bar is a one of the great " unknown " films of cinema	Eddie is a transvestite hostess at one of Tokyo's clubs . He / she spends her time working , being in the films of a friend , taking drugs and trying to find love . Said to be one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films and a big influence on Clockwork Orange this is probably one of the best films most people have never seen . Released in 1969 this film is as fresh and shattering as it must have been back when it was made . Set in a " Gay " world this is actually a movie about people and how they act and feel , the fact that they are gay is irrelevant . These are real people in a real world that seems to be happening now instead of when it was made ( due no doubt to the stunning black and white photography ) . The film uses just about every 1960 " art film " technique you can think of and does so better than any film in from Europe ever did ( Buñuel , and Bergman should have been this successful ) . Interviews of the cast , sudden juxtaposition of scenes , shifts in tone and style , sudden bursts of violence , all blend together to tell a story of a search for identity and place that is in its way universal , even if its outcome is not . This is a movie that is simple to explain , but difficult to sum up . The effect of it being somewhat greater than the simplicity of the storyline . See this movie . This is one of those movies that movie lovers should search out . ( Because to be honest I'm not sure if I'm more in love with the technique or the film itself - though either way its a great film )
427743	3079504	113858	9.0	Either except it as a cheesy romp and love it or take it seriously and hate it	This movie is in constant rotation on SciFi and its another one of those movies that I stop at each time its on . The plot has badly done giant mosquitoes attacking people in the country side . They have been mutated after feeding on the blood of dead aliens . . . I know you're shocked , you were expecting a high class movie ( even with the title Mosquito ) and instead you got a very silly movie played ( reasonably ) straight by everyone involved . Clearly the cast and crew knew this was a silly idea , but they milk it for all its worth turning the attack scenes into something you both wince at ( for the idea of it ) and groan at ( the silliness of the execution ) . This is one of the rare modern attempts at a drive in movie that walks the fine line between being serious and being mocking to create something thats enjoyable despite the dumbness of it all . If you can take it on its own level its worth two bags of popcorn and a couple of sodas . If you can't take it for what it it is then you're in for a long painful viewing experience . on the brain dead fun-o-meter .
428833	3079504	117568	9.0	A excellent erotic drama thats both compelling and on a human level and sexy	Its rare that movies with a sexual component are both interesting on the human level and interesting on the sexual level . Most directors seem to crank out indifferent stories that are merely excuses for bad soft core sex . Scorpio Nights on the other hand is completely different it has hot encounters and more importantly people you care about . Set in an apartment house in Manila where no one has any real privacy . The rooms are small and the construction is such that you can often see into your neighbors homes . A young tenant notices the activities of his down stairs neighbors through a hole in the floor . Smitten he watches the nightly routine of the husband coming home , eating dinner and then crawling into bed with his sleeping wife . It isn't long before he's managed to work his way into the heart of the woman below and started a torrid affair . Well done across the board this is the type of story that could have been over done , instead its all played very real ( In an interview the director said that he's been stopped by many people over the years who said that he manged to get the details of their affair right ) Truth be told as steamy as the sex is the really erotic moments are the ones either before the sex or the ones where sex isn't possible . There's a moment where the woman looks up at the ceiling with desire , yearning for her lover , he sees this and pushes his fingers through the holes in the boards . She then reaches for his fingers with an almost unearthly hunger . . . so he opens up a small door in the floor and extends his arm . . . Who needs graphic sex ? Best of all its not sexy because its sex , its sexy because its two real characters who we know and understand . These are two characters who could be us so we're compelled to continue watching . Actually the strength of Scorpio Nights is the interaction of the characters , they are real people with real problems and desires . The story is driven by them instead of driving them . Excellent . . Lets hope that some one is smart enough to get a really good edition of this out on DVD in English .
427213	3079504	290673	10.0	Cinematic Torture	If movies are suppose to effect the viewer then this movie is king of the hill . From the dis-orienting camera moves that open the film through the violence in the gay bar , the seemingly never ending rape and the films unraveling of the days events in a backwards march I have yet to meet anyone who has not been deeply effected by this movie - if they were brave enough or stupid enough to watch it . ( I'm still trying to figure out a local Best Buy displaying a large number of DVD's as if it was the latest Adam Sandler movie ) It is not an easy movie to watch but as an examination of what people are capable and how violence can come from nowhere and from the unexpected its a masterpiece . The backward structure takes what is essentially a dull revenge story and turns it on its ear as we are forced to really examine how things get out of hand very quickly and what people will do when pushed to the limit . If you want a challenge to your psyche and can brave simply some of the most vicious and nasty screen violence ( yes its graphic but much is also implied ) then see this movie - preferably with out distraction . But be warned , even if you think you know what this movie is about and what your limits in screen violence is , you still won't be prepared for what a mental hot foot this film is .
428709	3079504	96046	10.0	One of the Great but Unknown Horror Films of All Time	This film has to come to DVD soon so that more people can discover this chilling little trip into hell . The plot is simple , fleeing in a plane from a heist with hostages in tow , one robber tries a double cross by jumping out of the plane with the money and the others go back after him . The trouble is where they ended up is not where you really want to be , its a farm in the middle of nowhere and undead things are moving about and they are out for blood . Very little of why these things , these scarecrows , are lurking about is explained and its more terrifying for it since we don't know what the " rules " are . This film takes place in one blood soaked night and there isn't time to explain whats happening . All we know is that first these bad guys want their money back and second they want to stay alive . They don't have time to worry about anything beyond that . For me thats a big plus since its realistic , if you got into a situation like this you wouldn't care about the hows and whys , you'd just want it to stop . Some people need to be hand held and told every thing at every minute , if you need to know exactly why and how go somewhere else , since the film won't give you that , however its internal logic never fails . If you love horror or thrillers see this movie . This is one of the best , shot in low light and heavy shadow , it become oppressive , especially if you watch it with the lights out . This movie will freak you out , and make you wonder about that man hanging out in the fields .
427235	3079504	416717	10.0	Forget the plot . Simply put this is one of the greatest , most action packed movies ever made , even if it only cost two bucks to make	In English this film is called The Biggest Fist . What can I say about a movie that lifts its action scenes from mis-matched American movies ( They flipped sequences from Diamonds are Forever so the words are backwards , use the chase from Goldfinger , and I'm trying to figure out where the motorcycle sequences come from ) , has the car the hero drives change repeated through out a sequence , only pauses for two minutes at a time for drinks ( no really ) , has a sveltely pre-Xena wanna be in spandex as the kick ass heroine , has a beauty contest in the middle of it for no reason , a cat-fight for the affections of the hero - during which he sits and reads the paper , has more martial arts action then any ten Hong Kong films , loses its logic half way in - but keeps going , had bad visual effects ( except for those it stole ) and is in Turkish with no subtitles ? The only thing to say is five stars , , one of the best schlock action films ever made . Pure dreck but worth three bags of popcorn and two gallons of soda . This is pure devil may care / lets make a movie no matter how we have to get the footage cinema which was some how released to paying customer-albeit in Turkey . Amazing , absolutely amazing . . . and really watchable even if you have no idea what they're saying or doing or why ( Maybe its better that way ) . If you can go with the badness and surf it , this is one of the great cinema treasures of action chiefdom . A movie to hunt down and enjoy repeatedly
