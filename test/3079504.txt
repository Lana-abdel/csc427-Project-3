427949	3079504	182703	1.0	One of the worst acted films I've ever seen ( and the film making isn't much better either )	I'm not sure what to say about this film that will be helpful to anyone who wants to know about it . Frankly the only thing that comes to mind is don't . The story of two friends who's loyalty is tested when a woman comes between them is painful to watch . I've seen enough movies to know when there is a problem beyond the script , in this case its mainly the acting which is best categorized as bad . Its a combination of poor acting choices , characters posturing to look tough mixed with what can only be described in an overly generous mood as non-acting . Characters speak as if they are rehearsing rather than performing . Even Robert Z'Dar , of Maniac Cop fame , an actor you can always count on for a good performance comes across as phoning it in from three towns away . Its all very laughable . Technically this film isn't much better . The sets feel like they were left over from a bad high school music video . The camera work seems more like the point and shoot variety . My guess is that this was made for almost no money and it shows . ( An aside - while watching this movie I was struck by one thought over and over again , which might explain why the film is the way it is , and that is I'm not certain that this film was ever intended for an English language market . There is something about it that makes me think that this was made to be shipped over seas and dubbed in to Thai or Korean or Chinese . If thats the case I's suggest trying to find an import of this dubbed into a foreign language and subtitled back into English . - It's probably going to play better ) I really can't recommend this film to anyone unless they are trying to see every film with martial arts ever made . To put it another way I paid 99 cents for the DVD of this film and I feel ripped off .
428315	3079504	268295	1.0	Worst film by a director of any standing ever	This is nothing more than a cheap ass home movie done by a director who should have known better . Its not that there is anything wrong with this being made but the look and feel of it is that of a goof made among friends over a weekend for their own amusement . Regrettably someone though the rest of the world would find it equally enjoyable and released it on an unsuspecting world . The plot has Roderick Usher ending up in a asylum for murder where goth and allegedly racy things are going on . There music and jokes and tasteless stuff . Mostly there is an undying urge to turn the DVD off and put on one of Ken Russell's other films . . . anyone of them . I'm a Ken Russell fan . I've always liked that fact that no matter what he did there was always something interesting to look at or see somewhere in the movie . Here there is nothing . Its a complete waste of time . Oh how one of the cinema's great directors has fallen . . . .
428639	3079504	53240	1.0	Grabage	the Day the Earth Froze is one of the worst pieces of cinematic garbage I've ever seen . Don't get me wrong I like the fantasies of director Aleksandr Ptushko . I Love The Sword and the Dragon , I like the Magic Voyage of Sinbad and some of his Ruslan and Ludmila is gorgeous . His films are cinematic storybooks and the ethereal storybook quality that Ptushko puts into his work is here in spades . The plot is basically the tale of a witch causing the world to freeze but it is so stoically told and acted in the stick up the back manner that I wanted to slit my wrists rather than finish it . I'm certain that part of the problem is that the American version is missing a third of the film , but allowing for that its a horrible piece with all of Ptushko's worst mannerisms in full view .
427188	3079504	67179	1.0	Awful	Awful anime . The animation is even more limited than the stuff Rankin Bass would turn out years later . Its dubbed by Chuck McCann and friends for the Hal Roach Studios and its awful . I can't tell if the source was bad or the English dub , but its bad . Ten minutes and I was screaming , " no no no " while reaching for a bottle of rat poison . . . for the cartoon rat on screen , not me . I can't believe I've had this compared to the films of Disney , I don't think Disney ever made a movie this bad , or if they did they certainly didn't release it for the public to see . Not worth the time effort or money to see it . Avoid it if at all possible
428627	3079504	29207	1.0	One of the worst mysteries ever put on film	Eddie Quillan gives one of his worst performances as Ellery Queen . The plot involves the theft of a rare stamp and the murders that occur in its wake . Quillan , as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat . The mystery itself is fine . I can even live with the cheapness of the production ( nothing looks real ) . What I can't stand are the performances , no one in this cast with the exception of Frank Pangborn gives anything remotely like a performance . Can't anyone on screen act ? I guess not . The worst offender is Quillan who turns Ellery Queen into an insufferable twit . I wanted to smack him . Charming or disarming he's not . He ruins what could have been an okay bad movie . I hate this movie , I hate it a great deal .
426889	3079504	478216	1.0	One of the worst	Woman who may or may not be crazy has dreams about a demon called the nightmare man . It takes its form from a fertility mask and when she's left alone by her husband when they run out of gas the demon comes after her and chases her to a house in the woods . Awful just really awful . This was part of the after dark horror festival for this year and I'm shocked . Somewhere a while back I thought I saw on TV or in a horror fest or something ( months and months and months ago ) and I started it and hated it or at least disliked it enough to shut it off early on or walk out , this time unfortunately , as part of the After Dark festival , I suffered almost to the end . How this ended up in After Dark after that is beyond me . Its terrible . No one seems to be able to act which isn't entirely the casts fault since the direction is pretty poor . This reminded me of some really dreadful horror films from the early 1980's and late 1970's as the drive in films were dying . I'm talking films where Lawanda Paige was comic relief and big breasted " stars " took off their tops . You know a movie is bad when all I can say nice about it is that the women look good and some of them disrobe . I hope I never sit through this a third time .
428467	3079504	35007	2.0	Mad mess of a movie that shoots itself in the foot by badly blending comedy and horror . Only notable as Lionel Atwill's last leading role	Lionel Atwill plays Br Benson a scientist experimenting with suspended animation . Atwill has found a way of putting animals in to suspended animation , then curing their disease and then bringing them back to life . Unfortunately when he tries to move to people the good doctor finds that he can not revive his subjects thus provoking the police to look for the murderer . Fleeing he boards a ship and heads for the south seas . When the ship catches fire , Atwill and several other survivors end up on an island where Atwill uses his medical tricks to enslave the natives . B movie or not this is a mess of a movie . The film starts okay , with Atwill trying his experiment on a man trying to get money for his family . The police burst in and he's forced to flee . After that comedy sets in and the film doesn't know what it wants to be . Once the ship sinks and the survivors end up on the island things become a mixed bag . Its it suppose to be serious or a comedy ? First billed Una Merkel makes me think it was a comedy . Merkel as a crazy woman going to New Zealand for the fifth time to find love would usually be in the background to Atwill's craziness , but here she's often front and center . The problem is that the comedy is very heavy handed and not very funny . As a drama it isn't much better . Its natives in sarongs bowing before the mad Atwill , who looks bored and distracted . It reminded me of some of the dreadful jungle monster pictures from the 1950's where the mad scientist goes to the jungle and sets some creature loose like in From Hell it Came , except those movies were fun . I don't think that it helps that this film has something resembling a budget . Certainly the use of stock footage helped , but the fact that Universal spent probably twice what something like Republic , Monogram or a Poverty Row studio made me think that this would be something more than a really cheesy film . I know the reasonable look of the film made it hard to forgive the dopey script . To be honest this is a hard film to really discuss . Its a light weight B movie that is not bad enough to make one want to spend time commenting on it . Its a bad movie that makes you want to forget it after you've seen it , with a " well that was a waste of an hour " before moving on to something else . Its a misfire and not worth saying anything bad about simply because the movie inflicts enough damage on itself . Not worth bothering with except as a footnote in Lionel Atwill's career , his last starring role , and possibly his worst performance .
428753	3079504	831887	2.0	The director should stick to comics	Frank Miller directs an adaptation of Will Eisner's " classic " character for the big screen . What can I say ? Punisher War Zone was as close to a Punisher comic as you can get ( And one that Lion's Gate has ripped from theaters because it bombed so badly ) and The Spirit is as close to a Frank Miller comic as you can get on screen . This is what Miller does flaws and all on the big screen , great visuals and gawd awful dialog complete for all the world to see . The trouble is that Miller's painfully uneven dialog sounds really bad coming out of the mouths of actual human beings . Could we please stop with this comic style look already ? Yes at times it provides great visuals and at other times it just falls apart . No the film isn't good . No it isn't as horrible as many have made it out to be . . . but its close . the main problems ( I don't have enough time to go into all of them ) is first that Miller can't find a tone . Is this a comedy , if so what kind ? Is this a drama ? If so what kind ? Miller never seems to know and while the shifting tones can work on the page they don't work on the screen . ( Miller also holds his shots too long , what would be a single panel among many in a comic where you'd quickly pass over them , here he holds them much too long as if in love with the image , but thats another story ) . The second big flaw is the cast stinks . Samuel L Jackson is over the top . Scarlett Johansen is really bad ( I mean really bad , I mean she sucks ) and Gabriel Macht has no weight to him , which is bad since he is the hero . How did he get the lead ? All of the problems are Miller's , even the cast because even if he didn't have a say he had to direct them . Honestly I like Frank Miller . I like his comic stuff , but lets be honest where he is a first class artist his writing has been less then sterling once he was set loose as a name ( Have you actually READ 300 ? How about the Dark Knight Sequel ? and Sin City is at best uneven ) The Spirit is a deeply flawed film that just doesn't work .
426802	3079504	443453	2.0	I'm seemingly in the minority , I really don't like this movie	Sasha Cohen pretends to be a reporter visiting America and makes fun of people in the process . I understand the humor . I get the jokes . I just don't find them funny . Yes I'm in that seemingly small group of people who don't find Borat funny , or even particularly clever . No , I'm not a fan of Ali G , one of Cohen's other characters and who's show was the source of the Borat character . Forgive me the jokes aren't all that clever , it seems his jokes are low rent Monty Python malapropisms or jokes so stupid I doubt most cut rate vaudevillians wouldn't have touched them . Am I bothered by Cohen using these seemingly innocent as foils ? partly because they were set up to look stupid and didn't fall into their own trap , then again my feelings are mitigated by the fact I can't believe that no one caught on ( of course if they did we wouldn't see that ) . I am bothered by his " I'm so much cleverer than you attitude that pervades the film . Clearly he's amused by the joke he's telling which is all that matters . I sat there stone faced for 80 minutes .
427102	3079504	805497	2.0	Pointless collection of people talking about flops and hits never amounts to much of anything	Easily the dumbest documentary HBO has ever been involved in this is a " look " at what makes a hit or a flop . Using loose subject headings various people talk about how we can never know what will hit or what will miss . We see how the rules of one moment don't apply to the next . There is also a good deal of discussion about how all film making is a crap shoot since what should work very often doesn't . Actually what this film is lots of stars and studio execs sitting in chairs telling " witty stories " about the films that worked and the films that failed all the while trying to come across as " gee whiz " nice guys . While the stories are interesting the film quickly reveals that there isn't much of a point , or if there is one , the point doesn't require 75 minutes to have it beaten into your head . Its the sort of movie where some one says Howard the Duck and expects it to get big laughs . We also get rapid fire clips from the various movies that are suppose to illustrate the point but are too brief and fleeting to be much beyond a visual reference . Its so many people talking so briefly about so many different movies , or speaking so generally that you get no real information about anything . Yes , there are some telling remarks about life in Tinseltown but its much ado about nothing since its the equivalent to reading a book of quotes on the movies with nothing beyond the quotes . Personally , I was bored and after half an hour I picked up a magazine and began to read . If you like movies give it a try , after all there are some good lines and confessions ( George Clooney on responsibility and Brian Grazer on wishing someone else's failure ) but its too long and never adds up to anything worth anything .
426879	3079504	86247	2.0	Thank God , that means we'll never have to watch this again	This is one of the worst Japanese big budget films I've run across . The plot has something to do with a project concerning Jupiter going horribly wrong and . . . you really don't want to know . Trust me as bad as you think some of the Godzilla movies and films like The Green Slime are , this is worse , but not in a good way . This is just stupid , the hippies being the last straw on a short list of reasons to watch , none of which are good . I have no idea why anyone would like this on anything but a technical level since the plot , which I've finally been able to erase from my mind only thanks to years of very expensive therapy . All I remember is that the film seemed to want to be a flower power film but was made by people who didn't know what that was and were 15 years too late . ( these people couldn't plot a film even if they were handed it ) This film was suggested to me by a friend who loves it , " saying you'll either love it or you won't , but I think you will " . He was wrong . Trust me , there are better ways to spend two and a half hours , many much more pleasant
427619	3079504	1001548	3.0	Not very good	Confused and confusing low budget film film about a female CIA agent set up to take a fall and chased around ala Jason Bourne . Formulaic and by some numbers ( Its not always clear though which numbers ) . This is the sort of film that gets palmed off to late night cable to fill in the schedule holes . Regrettably while not really bad , its the sort of thing you'd channel surf past after watching five minutes never to return because you can't pick up what going on or you think you know where its going , so whats the point . . Take a pass
427984	3079504	447619	3.0	Boring .	Monica Bellucci adopts a young Asian child . Years later Bellucci begins having nightmares and someone or something seems to be interested in her son , who it appears has a great hidden power . I love the idea of Bellucci and Catherine Deneuve in a movie together . I only wish the pairing wasn't in a movie as dull as this . Its a been there and done that film ( I mean how many films are there where the adoptive parents didn't know their kid was special ? ) that has nothing new to offer . Its such an " exciting " film and I was so " intrigued " by what was happening that I didn't bother to finish the film when the DVD I wigged out and wouldn't play , I simply put it into the returns slot and let someone else deal with it . I'm guessing that thats whats been happening all along with that particular copy of the DVD . Don't run the risk of getting the bad DVD thats floating around , don't see this film . A snoozer .
426901	3079504	483200	3.0	The English version is too badly dubbed and so too confused to amount to much	Nikolai Gogol's story " Viy " has been filmed again and released to home video in the US via Faith Films . The original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him . Greatly expanded and set in America , though clearly filmed in Russia ( the houses , clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the English signs ) , this is an odd film that doesn't really work . Part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly isn't . There are also some weird , intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later . I'm not sure why they did that , even after watching the making of piece on the DVD ) The other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful . Its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera - or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps . I don't know if its Faith Films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the West ( revealed in the making of piece ) . The film isn't very good . As I've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio . Despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film . As film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god . Given the choice I'd give it a pass , even at a bargain bin price . My advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called Viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god .
428970	3079504	280802	3.0	Awful	Indonesian ( ? ) jungle film about a hidden tribe on a hidden island that revolts against a god sent leader . Of course a film crew shows up to film them and the " leader : and her band of warriors have to come to their rescue or some such nonsense . Its bad and awful and not in a good way . I lost patience very fast and while I think I might try it again I don't think anyone else should . The performances are poor ( I wouldn't blame the dubbing ) , the action isn't very good and there are simply too many WTF moments for any sane mind to take in . I like bad movies but this is almost too much to endure , even if you make fun of it as it goes on .
427449	3079504	67396	3.0	Atmospheric horror story is too talky for the first hour before heating up for the final thirty minutes	This film made me nod off to sleep . Despite decent film making , some good atmosphere this film just put me out . The problem is that for the better part of an hour nothing really happens . A diverse group of people keep crossing and recrossing each others paths before they end up in a weird mansion in the fog . At that point there is a great deal of talk before the bodies start to pile up and ghosts begin to appear . What exactly is going on I'll leave for you to discover since once things get moving the movie isn't that bad . ( Actually it isn't bad its just badly paced ) Is this worth seeing ? Its worth a shot , especially if you can get it as part of a multi movie pack or on cable , I wouldn't pay money to rent or purchase just this movie since its not that good .
427977	3079504	316654	4.0	Only Alfred Molina is worth watching ( and worthy of an Oscar )	I'm apparently in the minority of film goers in that I despise this film . Its simply one of the dullest , most predictable films I've seen in years , and yet people are falling all over themselves with praise for it . Which version did all these people see since it wasn't the one that played my local cinema . Basically this is a Spiderman film with out Spiderman . The Parker / MJ relationship trudges on , Osborne moans about how his father was killed by Spidey and Parker tries giving up the suit . Its dull and worst of all you know where its going . Perhaps its the trailers , or perhaps its just the conventions of the genre , but what ever it is this film is so predictable that Las Vegas is considering banning it as too sure a thing . The only joy is Alfred Molina's Doc Ock . When he is on screen you realize what this movie should have been . He is a villain of the highest order and gives a performance that Oscar will be noticing come award time . ( It better or else some super villains will tear down the Academy ) Molina gives the film a reason to be . Unfortunately instead of being the main thrust of the film he's given the short end of the stick . If I did my math right he's in it for around 30 to 40 minutes , and disappears from even conversation for whole sections of the film . He's the best thing in this movie and he's second banana to angst . Not that anyone is going to listen to me , but wait for cable or home video when you can zap through the dull parts . , simply because the Molina bits are dragged down by less than zero rest of the film .
426945	3079504	87903	4.0	Better with the sound off	Just Jaekin's film based on John Willie's bondage comic The Adventures of Sweet Gwendoline . In in the Orient in the 1920's or 30's Gwendoline and her best friend ship themselves over seas in order to find her missing father . Gwen is discovered in a crate and kidnapped and brought to a crime boss . Rescued by accident by a handsome hunk of a guy Gwen , her friend and the guy end up wandering off into the jungle / desert / lost city in order to find her father . As you can tell from the lack of names this really isn't good enough to pay attention to . Sure it has lots of beautiful women ( almost all of the naked or semi-naked variety ) and some decent action , but the over all direction ( a bit too slack ) and much too whimsical script under cuts its ability to send up films of the Indiana Jones variety . Yes its amusing for 20 minutes or so but then you realize that there are 80 more to go and you end up groaning loudly . The selling point of the film is the look . Its very much a fetishists dream with the lost city's Amazons all dressed in revealing leather , while the city itself contains some very nasty torture devices . it looks great and to be honest its the sort of thing thats gonna play oh so much better with the sound off . I'm still pondering how the heck I ended up with a copy of the film on DVD since even though I've read some recent vintage articles on the film which argued its better than its reputation , I never really liked the film much when I saw it all those years ago when I managed a video store . Still the extras are informative , and there always is the resale market . I'd take a pass on this one .
428224	3079504	38926	4.0	comedy ruins the mystery	Second attempt at turning the radio character into a movie series . This time out its Kane Richmond as Lamont Cranston and his alter ego the Shadow . Here he has no power to cloud men's minds , instead he wears a mask and a fedora . Here he is investigating the smuggling of jewels in coffins and the deaths the occur around it . Very comedic the film has almost no suspense despite its best efforts . The broad comedy simply cuts across the mystery and takes away from feeling of danger . The ploy almost works , however about two thirds of the way through the film the mashing of styles becomes too much and the back and forth nature of the plot ( There are only really three locations , the commissioner's office , the dead man's house and a warehouse ) interest dissipates and you get the feeling you'd really like to just jump to the end to see who the killer is . Worth trying but only on cable .
428477	3079504	419887	4.0	I was bored . Maybe the book was better	Story of redemption that left me bored . The story is of an Afghan writer living in the US . He gets a call from an old family friend which causes him to remember his days growing up in Afghanistan before the Soviets invaded . His inability to help a his best friend when he is attacked by some older boys strains the relationship . Back in the present the phone call gives him the chance to " become good again " by returning home . Feeling more like a small independent movie of the week this film rarely ever comes to life . The film very much has the feel of another place and time , but at the same time it feels very artificial and " movie like " . To be certain the boys who play the leads as children are surprisingly good , and the adults could have learned something from them . The adults are adequate , but no more than that , and as for the chemistry between the writer and his wife its non existent , there is no passion , no sense other than they just met that instant , not having been married for any length of time . ( forgive me for not remembering names I was fighting just to stay awake ) . Its not bad , but its not engaging and any sense of what its about beyond a very general notion about being about redemption and correcting past mistakes was lost on me .
428422	3079504	29989	4.0	Exploitation " classic " is more silly than shocking	Exploitation classic thats more humorous now then either titillating or shocking . This is an anti-child bride film . Yes there was a time when young , even preteen girls could get married to older men . This is the story of a young girl who may be doomed to suffer such a fate . A serious subject , the film is now very silly with some acting styles that went out of style in the early days of silents ( Watch the scene when Jennie gets up in the morning and try not to fall on the floor laughing . ) Give the film points for having some realer characters than many backwoods films coming from Hollywood , but take a few away since this film is really just an exploitation film . Notorious for a brief flash of nudity in a skinny dipping scene by the then 12 year old star ( some prints excise it ) its nothing even remotely titillating or sexy . Its actually done in such away as to be fleeting and not even clear . I probably shouldn't have even mentioned it except some people are shocked or horrified by it . The film itself is better than it should be , however its still not very good . As I said much of it plays more humorous than serious and its so creaky that you can see the machine like plot clacking away towards its conclusion where you end up on the edge of your seat waiting to see if Jennie will suffer a fate worse then death . ( Its much less over the top than say a film like Reefer Madness where you can laugh at it , which takes away much of the fun ) If you're a fan of creaky exploitation films give it a try . All others stay away .
428475	3079504	39530	4.0	Supporting Frank Albertson is such a jerk that it makes enjoying the comedy next to impossible	Salesman who can't get a girl , plays it like a tough guy to win himself one . Unfortunately he also looks like a notorious gangster and finds himself in deep trouble . Set in 1931 , the film is clearly the product of the 1940's , no real attempt was made to actually make the film look like when it was set ( clothes and hairstyles are definitely post war ) . I don't think it would have made any difference as to when the film was set so I don't know why they bothered to make it 1931 . The film itself is a mildly amusing comedy of the fill in the blanks kind . Once you realize that the harmless Dill is going to be confused as killer you can pretty much wind it up and follow its path without thinking . The big problem with the film is Dill's attorney friend played by Frank Albertson . Albertson's character is as big a jerk as they come . Constantly out of money he is forever borrowing cash . Worse he does whatever suits him best , even to the detriment of everyone around him . I don't think I've seen as big a heel or jerk in a film in many years . He's such a slime that its almost impossible to believe that anyone , even the downtrodden Dill , would put up with him ( most amazingly he actually has a fiancé ) . Albertson is such a jerk that the film ceases to be a comedy ( weak though it is ) and simply become a Theater of Cruelty production . How much abuse can he hand out before he gets his comeuppance ? ? I didn't want to find out . Not horrible , but not really good either . This is 70 minutes best spent somewhere else . ( Gargling is always good )
428818	3079504	765447	4.0	I expected so much more from a film with this cast	Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less . Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love . . . This is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is . Not bad as such but with Redgrave , Toni Collette , Glenn Close , Meryl Streep , Clare Danes , Natasha Richardson , Eileen Atkins , Patrick Wilson , Hugh Darcy and others ( all giving fine performances ) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance . Wait for Cable .
427398	3079504	57160	4.0	Disappointing thriller starts off great then sort of runs out of steam as not very much seems to happen .	An architect and his wife go to remote castle like house somewhere in California . They are to do a survey of the house for the owners who have know retaken possession of the house after renting the place out for ten years . Once they arrive they find the road to the place blocked off by a makeshift dead end sign . Later that night , as they sleep in their beds something steals their keys to the place . What is going on ? Moody and atmospheric tale in which there isn't much beyond the mood and the atmosphere . Here is the story of two couples alone in a big empty house who try to unravel what is causing the ( few ) strange events around them . The problem is that not a great deal happens and when you get to the final revelation its terribly anti-climatic . Certainly for the first half of the movie you're hooked by the mood and shadows of whats on the screen but then it suddenly begins to dawn on you that almost nothing has happened and unless something radical happens nothing is going to . Honestly there is enough for a half hour movie here but not enough to prevent boredom for the films one hour running time . This is not a movie to see pan and scan since all of the things that make the film so eerie and moody will be cut off by the panning and scanning . For all its flaws this is a movie that should be looked at to see how mood can be created in a widescreen image . Ultimately though , this is a movie thats best left to people who want to see a scary movie but one thats not too scary . Perfect for parents who want to show their kids an adult thriller but don't want them up all night screaming . The rest of us may want to take a pass unless an undemanding mood hits . ( A Word of Warning - The DVD has the trailer on the disc and I suggest avoiding it until after you see the film . It gives away almost all of the high points of the film while suggesting a much more action packed film )
427938	3079504	765443	4.0	Cold mechanical tale of the Russian mafia in England is hard to connect to	Story of a midwife who gets caught up in the fringes of the Russian mob when she attempts to track down the family of a baby when the 14 year old mother dies delivering the child . Well acted , great looking and made with a technical flair that will probably garner many awards comes years end . Unfortunately for me its also cold , distant and strangely un-involving ; it took me two passes to get through ( the first time I changed movies because it was clear early that the film just wasn't working for me . ) Part of the problem is that the film feels mechanical . I can see how tab A was put into slot B and it was folded along line c . I never felt that the film or its characters were really alive . It seemed to be a bigger budgeted version of the classic " indie " film where if you do certain things you'll provoke certain reactions ( and win certain awards ) . I'm a huge David Croneberg fan going back to Scanners ( the point at which the name meant something , though I know I had seen The Brood and his other films ) so while I don't find it odd that he's made a film thats cold and detached ( many of his horror films are icy and clinical ) , I find it odd that he's made a film thats so detached as to be unable to connect with the audience . For me there is always something that connects you , but here there is nothing . For me its the extremely rare film from a master director that doesn't resonate with me as anything other than a misfire . I've been reading some reviews on the film since seeing it but I'm still flummoxed . There are discussions of deeper meanings and hidden layers , but I don't see them . The characters don't seem to be that well deep , Naomi Watts ' midwife doesn't seem to be much beyond a woman in search for a surrogate child , while our mob boys are clearly not what they seem , which we know going in ( how can you not know that the sweetness hides and poisoned interior ) . Even looking back from the conclusion of the film I'm left wondering where the more than meet the eye many people have spoken about is residing ( certainly not in the plot " twists " which just drive the story ) . Don't get me wrong its not a bad movie . Its a well made one , but as a story its just okay . perhaps had it not been hyped I might have warmed to it , but the reviews have been such that I was expecting an assault on my senses that never came . I will give the film a deserved second ( well third ) chance , but I think that unless I suddenly find something to latch on to I will have to rate this as one of the director least interesting efforts .
427643	3079504	765460	4.0	Just misses being good and ends up being a mess	Church going house wife is arrested and charged with murder . Things become complicated as her neat little life begins to unravel and when its clear the Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the case doesn't care if she's guilty since he's looking to win the up coming election . Weakest film directed by actor turned director Bill Duke . Feeling more like a Tyler Perry wannabe thriller then the realistic and often gritty films that Duke usually turns out , this film seems more intent on being about something other than the mystery at hand . The film has a weak script which has too many " dark secrets " that the good cast can't really turn into anything truly worth watching . It just misses . . . and whats worse you can see it going whizzing by . . .
427829	3079504	43080	4.0	Not particularly much of anything	American sailor has his ship attacked by pirates and ends up ashore in Australia where he falls in love with one of the local women . When the pirates attack the village the sailor has to go off to rescue his lady love . . . only to end up shipwrecked on an island with dinosaurs . Misbegotten adventure film that stands out only because of the dinosaurs in the final minutes , this is a clunky adventure film that isn't very good . One person here on IMDb indicates that this is actually several episodes of an an sold TV show stitched together , which makes perfect sense owing to the compartmentalized structure of the films stories . Not really bad , it is like watching an old TV show that you never heard of for a good reason . I picked up the film because of the dinosaurs on the cover only to later read about how they only show up at the end , and then was shocked at how little even that was . My dislike for the film has nothing to do with the lack of monsters , indeed I was ready to bail on the film early on , but kept going because I wanted to see said beasties . Not worth your time , let alone your money
428027	3079504	71465	4.0	Some weird images and not much sense	Weird exorcist inspired horror film from the man responsible for the Blind Dead films . The story has something about an old witch using the daughter of a politician to get revenge . . . and then something . It wasn't 100 % clear . Creepy at times because of the imagery rather than the story this is a lost little film that probably isn't really a loss being lost . That said I'm going to try to watch this again down the road when its not 2am . Whether you should take a stab at seeing this I'm not sure . Its images aside I'm not sure there is enough to recommend it , though if you get it in a multi-film DVD set like I did I'd give it a shot .
428681	3079504	1210117	4.0	Uneven and not too bad kids film	On the English language DVD I saw this is called Impy's Wonderland . German made animated film isn't bad , nor is it very good . Its about a year old dragon ( or dinosaur with wings ) living on a island with other talking animals and people who is tempted away from his island by a millionaire who needs monsters for his amusement park . The animation is uneven with it hovering around TV quality material . The plot and such is too dull to amount to much . I don't know if its the English dub or if the original German was just as bland since th copy I saw only was dubbed . There is some connection to an earlier version of the characters on a German TV show , but I don't know anything about it other than the connections I can gather up from the IMDb listings . There are better ways to spend your cash then renting or seeing this , but if you do get stuck watching it you probably won't pluck your eyes out .
428361	3079504	48992	4.0	Old school monster on the loose tale is one of Willis O'Beiens worst efforts	The problem with High Def TVs and old films is perfectly shown by BEAST FROM HOLLOW MOUNTAIN , this was , I think , Willis O'Brien's last film . An old school movie that predates Harryhausen's Valley or Gwangi , its about a T-Rex loose in Mexico . Painfully dull until the monster begins the rampage ( I mean PAINFUL ) the film really isn't that good . The monster isn't much better than what O'Brien did in the Lost World or King Kong . Clearly his better days were past him as the effects , while serviceable look no better and no more realistic than what many amateur film makers cranked out ( look at the end of the monster in the swamp and be appalled . ) The problem is that in High Def the color photography goes wildly grainy when you get the process shots combining the animated monster and the real people . Its awful looking almost like a blizzard . I know the problem is that the film was made cheaply and was never meant to be seen that clearly , but this is awful . . . as is the movie . . . except for the rampage which is fun in truly bad sort of way
427411	3079504	1227181	4.0	This could have worked if it didn't seem like every other independent film out there	Independent urban drama about a guy wondering if there is more to life then hanging out with his friends in the gang . As an opportunity to advance comes along he has to decided which way to go since his girlfriend gives him an ultimatum . Well made independent film that looks like a hundred other independent films . Good enough to wish it didn't seem like so many other films . I'm all for the ability for people to make films on their own but what ever happened to the idea that independent films were fresh and original . The script and the actors are here but the direction and look of the film in utterly interchangeable with so many other films I've seen recently . Worth a look only if you don't watch a great deal of independent films .
428717	3079504	430770	4.0	The cast is there , the scenes work but it never comes together	Updating of the Clare Booth Luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment . The cast of women is excellent , most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together . There is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum . Granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common , but at the same time its just as timely as ever , I just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot . Wait for Cable .
427745	3079504	385700	4.0	Visually awesome this film will be little more than eye candy if you haven't played the game . I haven't played it and found it a painful experience	I'm bound to be disliked by the legion of of Final Fantasy fans who have rated this film highly but I have to disagree and say that the film , for anyone other than some one familiar with the games , is going to be a long dull haul . Let me go on record as saying that this is one of those eye popping jaw dropping visual experiences that makes me realize just how special movies are . There are sights in this movie that will impress even the most jaded of movie goers . Wow . If one is telling a story one generally needs more than pure visuals . Sure great visuals can cover plot holes but at the end of the day you need something , characters people can relate to and a plot that has a beginning , middle and end . Here the story is a continuation of a video game . There is some attempt at bringing viewers up to speed , but for the most part the film assumes you know whats gone before and what the previous relationships are , if you don't its too bad for you . Or Me . I never played the game and was ultimately lost fifteen minutes in . I had no idea why anything was happening since all motivation happened prior to the movie I was watching . I went from " Oh Wow " about the visuals to yawning because I became so lost I didn't care . Sure the visuals occasionally carried the day , but most of the time they ended up wasted on a film that will only mean something to a small select group of game fans . I was so disappointed because with out a plot even the visuals began to lose their appeal ( or at least look like the video game that they sprang from ) . Can I recommend this visually impressive film thats short on plot ? That depends . If you want to see some sparkling visuals and don't mind the lack of plot , do see this since it will knock your socks off ( Try for the best possible conditions - big TV and great sound ) . If you are a fan of the game see this film since it will mean something to you . If you need a plot , if you need more than visuals , then the choice is yours as to whether you see it since odds are you'll be snoozing . .
427555	3079504	30666	5.0	Neither the mystery nor the expose promised by either of the films titles .	A young rich woman named Martha , , who's mother died while she was off partying in Europe , is trying desperately to contact her mother on the other side . She is loved by a reporter who's chances with her are ruined when an editor turns a friendly puff piece on the girl into something more sinister . Martha meanwhile has become acquainted with a mystic , the Great LaGagge , who promises to put the woman in contact with her mom , however he really wants her money . When woman dies at LaGagge's temple he is forced to flee , however before he does he arranges for Martha to go off on a around the world trip to mystic places , Egypt and India where he will guide her into giving over her money to him . The reporter not one to give up easily gives chase . Odd mix of mystery and expose of the medium racket ultimately falls between the too posts being neither revealing ( very little is actually exposed ) nor very mysterious ( of the two deaths only one is murder and we know who did that ) . Its not a bad movie and it does work as a drama , but it'd not something that works as advertised . I don't know what else to say beyond that .
428922	3079504	35185	5.0	Just okay remake of a good thriller removes all of the thrills for gags and an obvious solution .	Remake of the Linoel Atwill thriller the Sphinx has been rethought so its now a jokey romance between an Assistant District Attorney and a reporter . Its not bad , but where the original was a creepy thriller , this is too light to be truly gripping , especially if you've seen the original . The plot has ADA Dick Purcell investigating the murder of a wealthy individual . The one suspect , a known deaf mute played by John Hamilton was seen to talk by a janitor ( Montan Moreland ) at the crime scene , while he was seen by dozens of witnesses , including the reporter , at a dedication ceremony . The solution here is so clumsy as to be obvious well before its revealed making the film unexciting . The result is we're left with the not a great deal to hold our interest , and the feeling that once again a very good original should not have been remade .
427722	3079504	427038	5.0	Frustrating sequel to a classic film - It should have been a radio play ( or had a better director )	( This is not an objective review but a personal rant about what might have been ) The plot of this movie follows the early days of Carlito , as he rises to power and prestige in the drug world . ( his later exploits were told in Brian DePalma's Carlito's Way ) This film disappointed me a great deal . Here's a reasonably well written movie that completely falls apart because the director can't make this film look like anything more than a mediocre direct to home video movie . He has decent actors and a decent script based on a good novel , but he is rudimentary in how he handles the shots . There is no feeling that the actors are doing any more than pretending because we are never drawn in to what was happening on screen . It looks fake . You never believe any of it . If you want to see how dumb the choices are you need look no further than the opening monologue where the tenuous position of the Porto Ricans is explained . We have a well read bit of dialog inter-cut , badly , with black and white footage and stills . When the script calls for some one to die we hear a gunshot with a clichéd close up of a gun firing that doesn't match the surrounding footage . Its so clichéd your mouth drops open because you can't believe some one would do something that dumb . But it shouldn't be like this . The script is actually quite good . . . Growing tired about a third of the way into the movie I began to close my eyes . As I listened to the film I suddenly began to like what I was hearing . I opened my eyes because I figured that the movie had gotten better , but I was instantly struck by how the script and the performances were being wounded by the visuals and directorial choices . He's a perfect case of a bad director turning fillet Mignon in to sloppy joes . If you liked the first movie you may want to try this , but I'd either do something else while watching , or turn off the TV and just listen to the sound through the sound system since it plays better as a radio play . for a good script and cast .
427010	3079504	810880	5.0	Its all there except the script	Giancarlo Esposito directs and co stars in the story of a town with racial strife in its past thanks to the killing of a civil rights leader decades before . As the ghosts of the past are woken up and a new corporate threat comes to town the people in the town are forced to make some choices . Well made and well acted tale wants to hit one out of the box in examinations of race and community , but is mired with a script that never completely shakes off its well worn cloak . We've been here before and while much of the film works , it still relies on cliché ( there is something about Julia Stiles character that just doesn't ring true ) . I think perhaps the film is trying to do too much , there are a good number of characters and all are given a certain amount of time . I liked it , but I didn't love it . Of course the DVD cover made it look like a thriller or mystery , which while it has elements isn't what it really is .
428706	3079504	364751	5.0	Some laughs but its trying to be too many things lessens the effect	Three life long friends are rocked when a fourth member of the crew is killed in an accident . Moved by the dead friends fearless lifestyle the trio sets off to find the treasure of DB Cooper . Some laughs ensue . What is this film trying to be ? A comedy ? An early mid-life crisis film ? a buddy movie ? What ? Spoof of Deliverance ? Actually its all of them and a few more . Sadly while I can report it's much better than some of the reviews , I have to go on record saying that its over reaching nature diminishes the entire effect . This movie could have worked better but there is to much in the mix . Granted the clichés thin the mix a good deal but thats balanced by things like Burt Reynolds funny turn as a mountain man . I don't know . I wanted to like this more . But its too much of some stuff so its too little in others . Worth a go on DVD or cable , but not for 9 bucks in the theater . .
428775	3079504	25699	5.0	If you can get through the slow stretches this is a good little western	John Wayne rides into a saloon and finds the player piano running and everyone in the place dead . The safe has been broken into as well . As Wayne investigates the scene the sheriff and posse arrive and promptly arrest Wayne vowing to get his gang as well . Breaking out of the jail with the help of the saloon owner because she knows he didn't do it Wayne is off to find out who did . Though held by many as a classic , I'm not too sure of its status . Its certainly got some good moments and at least one classic moment in it , but its not really a classic sort of film . The opening of the film where John Wayne walks into the saloon and finds everyone dead is one of the creepiest sequences I've ever seen in any sort of film . There is something unsettling about the whole affair that really gets under your skin . Its the type of thing that makes you sit up and pay attention , I just wish the rest of the film was on on par with that one scene . Unfortunately this 53 minute film also has a great deal of filler . There are frequent stretches were people just ride between locations . This doesn't include the chases which seem to spring up every five minutes or so . Its deadly and it kills the pace of the film which would be a taut 30 or 35 minute with out them . Worth a look for that one scene if nothing else .
429139	3079504	57193	5.0	Big bloated and somewhat funny	Talk about over done . . . . Every comedian in the world , or so it seems , criss-crosses through this story of greed and unpleasant people . The plot is simple - when a man dies in an auto accident he tells of a buried fortune which those that stopped to help him go off and try to find . Its broad comedy of the slapstick kind that you will either find funny or painfully overdone . I find it over done and over long . There is no need to have this unspool as long as it does , especially when whole sections of it fall flat . Still if the mood strikes you you may be one of the legion of fans who think this is the funniest movie ever made . I don't and try to avoid it when I can .
428279	3079504	65917	5.0	Absolutely beautiful vampire movie is a mess of confused tones and pretensions	This a weird retelling of the Dracula story reconfigured as to be some sort of anti-fascist film . Its a beautiful film to look at but more than a bit strange in execution . The plot , if I picked it up correctly , has to do with a town that has been held in the grip of a band of vampires who all dress in what reminds one of fascist uniforms . Their leader bears more than a passing resemblance to Hitler , but with out the mustache . Deciding that they have had enough of the terror they form a plan to drive all of the vampires into the ocean . In order to get better information on the vampires they send in one of their own to the vampires castle . What transpires after that is both interesting and very pretentious , unfortunately the pretentiousness wins out . You have speeches and discussions that are less than veiled discussions of politics and completely ruin any normal sense of horror . You have a group of young girls who appear in many scenes of the vampires performing odd ballet or synchronized moves and in so doing distract you from the main action of the scene . It wouldn't be so bad except that much of the film can't make up its mind as to what its about , is it a horror film or a political film ? I don't think it fully knows . The result of the confusion is a film that often comes off as being very funny , the problem is I can't be sure how much of it is suppose to be funny . The best part of this film is the look of it . This is one of those movies that amazes you with every shot . No matter what is going on , silly or serious , it all looks great . It sucks you in simply because you want to see the images that pass before your eyes . This film has tracking shots and haunting images that will stay with me forever ( Two high points that come to mind are the first time we go to the vampires castle and travel among all of them ; and the final sequence on the beach which has some haunting imagery . ) Can I recommend this film ? Truthfully , not to anyone who isn't a vampire completest or a film nut who loves to see beautifully shot films since the cinematography is what makes this work despite its pretentious flaws ,
427212	3079504	311618	5.0	A Beautiful Vanity Project	This is one of the best looking anime features I've run across . The animation is glorious , the design and the world created are rich in images and wonders to see . The trouble is that the movie is a snail paced retelling of Pinocchio that even at two hours and sixteen minutes doesn't tell the whole story , there are gaps between sequences that leave you puzzling how we got from A to B . The film is suppose to be a very personal project by the director who worked on it for ten years , but there is such a thing as being too close to a project and in this case he was much too close . I can see how the lack of complete explanation might appeal to some people but for me it was more bewildering than intriguing , the film didn't make a lot of sense and took forever not making it . ( Visuals are a , the rest is up to you , I give it a five over all simply because the visuals are so fantastic it makes watching it interesting at least for a majority of it )
428877	3079504	469263	5.0	Quirky tale of a civilian astronaut is too quirky for its own good , but still delivers a few good moments .	Billy Bob Thorton is a once upon a time astronaut who had to leave the program to work on his family farm . Never having lost his desire to go into space he builds his own rocket , much to the dismay of the government . Off beat story is good but never quite pulls it together . Its a little too forcibly off beat signaled by the opening as Thorton rides around his farm on horseback in a space suit . Its almost like an annoying indie film that thinks being quirky means its a good film , with a bigger budget and bigger stars . Despite some great characters and some great exchanges ( I love Thorton dealing with the government people who want to shut him down ) this never adds up to the moon shot it was hoping for . this could have been something , but it just missed Worth a shot , but I'd wait for cable
428743	3079504	75230	5.0	Better then the usual slavery exploitation film	Period set tale of the slave trade in Africa and how the nominal hero , Ron Ely goes from supporting it to instead helping to end it . Good melodramatic story is full of all of the exploitation hallmarks you'd expect - nudity , violence , general bad behavior - , but done less garishly and over the top in films like Mandingo and The Drum or any of the other films from the 70's that exploited the slave trade in the name of teaching us all a lesson . There aren't many of these films and for the most part they are a poor lot with most of the films so bad that they are funny . This one however is better then the rest even if it does get a bit melodramatic . The best thing I can say is its a watchable potboiler .
428094	3079504	455760	5.0	Just okay ventriloquist story sifts through most of the clichés and borrows some rifts from other horror films in a low rent and badly directed attempt at scares	Young couple finds a ventriloquist's dummy outside their door . When the man leaves to pick up dinner his wife is killed by the dummy . Investigating further he realizes that the dummy is connected to his past so the estranged son heads home to his fathers house where he hopes to unlock the secrets of what killed his wife . Dully directed this film runs through pretty much every ventriloquist cliché there is and then steals from a few other movies ( like Dead and Buried ) . Mostly unremarkable this is the sort of cheap movie ( there are almost no characters or logic all of the money going into some big sets ) that would have ended up on ScFi as a SciFi original , but since it has a connection to the people who made the Saw films got it a theatrical release . I think I would have liked this better on TV then shelling out 10 bucks a head to see this on the big screen . I'm guessing that once this hits cable or DVD it will develop a cult following of people who will feel that it under appreciated . What annoys me about this film is that it has moments , fleeting though they are , that show what the film could have been . There are creepy images of " monsters " and the like ( the image of our heroes dead wife ) that are truly scary , but these are the exception and hint at what the film might have been had the film had a better director . I didn't hate it , I just wish that I had seen it on cable for free where its poor direction and low rent nature would have been more acceptable than for ten bucks on the big screen .
427598	3079504	114241	5.0	Not very good adaptation of a not very good play	Walking out of the current ( October 2004 ) revival of the Craig Lucas play I overheard a couple talking about the film version of the play and it suddenly came back to me why it all seemed familiar , I saw it on TV several years ago . The story of how a woman who's husband can't take her any more and hires a hit man to kill her , only to send her away before he arrives is a very strange story . No one and nothing is who they seem to be . And the twists and turns seem rather random . The whole bit about visiting every Springfield in the country is just plain dumb . The dialog is clever at times but mostly it seems forced . Worse is the fact that this probably should never have been made into a film . The play which is full of whimsey and is stylized does not translate into a film well . The actors are okay but many are completely wrong for the roles . The Goldwyn / Farrow coupling doesn't quite work so the story isn't believable from the get go . If given the choice of play versus movie go for the play where the whimsey works better , however you would be better off renting or seeing pretty much anything else . for the bits that work . Side Note : Mary Louise Parker who plays Pootie and a couple other members of the cast of this film are in the current Broadway production . Obviously they are gluttons for punishment
427832	3079504	427327	6.0	Travolta's acting ruins any of the joy that this buoyant musical may have produced .	This is the film adaption of the musical based on the film by John Waters . I liked the Waters film but it was never more than a passing like . The musical never appealed to me , I never cared for the music so I never saw the show . Everyone in my office is raving about it and seeing it multiple times so I gave it a go . Its been said that love for the film will ultimately be gaged by how one reacts to John Travolta and his portrayal of Edna Turnblatt . Travolta is awful . I disliked him intensely and so had to give up the film despite a mostly excellent cast . With an vocal performance that changes from moment to moment and an accent that is , I don't know what the heck it is , this is one of the worst performances I've seen in ages , even when compared to some of Travolta's other recent goes at screen acting . Putting Travolta in a dress doesn't make him a woman , hell one need only think of J Edgar Hoover to know that a bear in a dress is still a bear . Travolta moves like a macho trucker on triple dose testosterone in a dress . He plays it like a guy who knows nothing about women . I don't know if its his choice or the directors but it just kills it for me . Its funny for all the wrong reasons . I know the part is suppose to be broad but this is pushing it . Other than that core mistake the film isn't that bad and those looking for a bouncing up beat film could do much worse .
428636	3079504	286112	6.0	Good but not great	You either accept this movie as it is or you don't . This is a very silly movie about a group of brothers who form a soccer team and find self respect in doing so . Its basically a kung fu movie done as a soccer film . As I said , its very silly , for example the villain's soccer team is called Team Evil . The film is knowing and cute and sweet and funny . . . . . . and I didn't care for it . Don't get me wrong , I laughed and I smiled and I thought it was way too long and occasionally over done . Perhaps this plays better in the " short version " that Miramax was going to release in the US which was to be about 20 minutes shorter then its original , and apparently now restored running time . To me its an hour long story , not two . What boggles my mind is that the film is going to get any sort of real release here . Granted the release date has been changed several times , which has caused the director and star to be on TV shows promoting a film that was now months away . But I can't help but wonder if someone really likes the film or if they think the combo of soccer and kung fu is going to play well in Peoria or at least to Peroria's help . Frankly its not that good and no better than any of several dozen comedies that Hong Kong film makers have produced over the years . Then again I know this has been a big hit on the festival circuit and I've been reading about it for a while in articles by people who really like it , so what the hell do I know ? If you like silly try it . Who knows it may strike you as something wonderful , as for me I'm simply going to remain puzzled . No I'm going to watch Bend it Like Beckham again .
428142	3079504	1010048	6.0	I liked it I didn't love it	Probable Oscar nominee didn't float my boat . Its a good film but I don't know whether too many people have told me how great it is or is it not that great and people are simply reacting to the exotic nature of the film , either way it didn't blow my skirt up . This is the story of Jamal who is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees in India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire . Certain this lower class kid must be cheating he's in the police station where some extreme methods are being employed to find out how he's cheating . Insisting that he is not cheating Jamal recounts his life's story with appropriate pauses to explain how he knows the answers . Far from what I expected , I didn't expect the level of violence , this is a good little film . Its the sort of thing where luck , or is it fate , allows you enough information to get ahead . Its the sort of thing designed to make you feel good . As I said I'm not in love with the film . I like it but I'm not in love with it . Perhaps its a little too cute at times ( The kid in the poop ) and it didn't help that the romance vital to much of the later part of the film didn't feel right to me . As an exercise in film-making its a masterful achievement blending a variety of styles into something uniquely its own . Danny Boyle is quite simply one of the best filmmakers working today one need only look at the last four films he's directed to see the range he has . Its a dizzying , great looking , great sounding film that makes even the squalor of India seem magical . I wish more directors had Boyle's abilities . That said the film didn't click with me . I respect the people who've fallen in love with the film enough to give the film a second go down the line . , but for now Its a good film that I don't think is one of the best of the year . ( For those , like me who didn't realize this was as violent as it it be warned - There are shootings , clubbings , torture , people set on fire , and nastiness to children . Its not a film for kids , though reviews I've seen made it seem so )
428585	3079504	451079	6.0	Some of the best animated madness is mixed with some of the blandest	Beautifully animated retelling of the Dr Suess tale of Horton the elephant finding the speck of dust where Whoville resides and then having to protect it from danger . As good as the film looks its an uneven affair . Brilliant set pieces ( anime homage ) and jokes ( monkeys stuffing bananas in their mouths ) are followed by exposition and bits that confuse humor with busy action . Despite or because of some of the best cartoon jokes in years the film still disappointed me - how could a film that is capable of such cleverness so often miss the mark ? Okay it doesn't miss the mark so much as be be dull ( or not live up to the mark the good stuff sets for itself ) . Half way in I was annoyed enough to want to leave . The one thing that doesn't disappoint is the voice cast with Jim Carrey fine and not too silly as Horton , Steve Carrell as the Mayor quite good , Carol Burnett evil as the Kangaroo and Charles Osgood wonderful as the narrator . Worth a look at some point . . . probably on DVD or cable .
427664	3079504	65483	6.0	a good Andy Milligan film	One of The better Milligan films that actually sort of works if you give it a a few allowances . One of Milligans English films , this movie actually is a good . . . okay . . . just . . . story of a vampires and such trying to get new blood into their family . ( that maybe giving too much away , or not since the movie doesn't wholly make sense . ) Technically competent which only has to survive the need to keep all of the actors in close huddle and some make up that would be too thick even on stage , this is a decent drama / thriller thats actually one of the few Milligan movies I can recommend on any level . Sure it dances the fine line around being a bad movie ( and crosses over into that territory a few times ) but its the sort of time killer you may actually watch to the end . Both better and worse than I'm making out this maybe the Milligan movie to start with if you have a yen so long as you understand what you're getting yourself into .
428332	3079504	478134	6.0	Great story of a family dealing with a tragedy gets lost in a government cover-up	This review contains a potential spoiler . Paul Haggis's bloated tale about one man's search for his missing son , a soldier who'd just returned from Iraq . Well acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon as the soldier's parents this is an occasionally touching film that makes the mistake of trying to be about something more . The film spins out of control and into territory covered by Missing some 25 years ago when the young man is found dead and the army begins to weave its own investigation . Haggis has an agenda unfortunately it makes for a confused story since the whole cover up , " what really happened " and why plot line gets in the way of the lovely and heart breaking tale of parents dealing with the death of their son . Sarandon's quiet internal destruction upon seeing her son's remains will haunt you . Regrettably the emotion in those scenes are drained as we loop around in yet another government is bad and is only out to protect its own ass at the cost of the truth tale . It doesn't ring true , even if it is , and the denouncements of the end seem to be contrived . I'm disappointed . Honestly better than I thought it would be , but not as good as it should have been . Worth a look on DVD or cable .
428466	3079504	74356	6.0	Story of a Bigfoot like monster on the loose is best watched at night with the lights out	Two college students from Chicago decide to investigate the stories of a Bigfoot-like creature in the area around Black Lake Louisiana . Once there they find that no one wants to talk to them about the creature . However they begin to make friends who open up with tales of the creature . They end up in a battle for their lives when the creature comes after them . Drive-in fare from the 1970's is much better than its reputation would suggest . While certainly not the scariest movie ever made it does have its share of chills as the little seen monster causes mayhem to those who stray with in its grasp . I don't know what my reaction would have been had I seen this is a drive-in back in ' 76 and then driven home in the rural south . My guess is I would be dreading hearing the creepy cry of the creature ( a cry I know my brothers would have loved to imitate to scare anyone who saw the film ) . Definitely worth a look for those who don't need their horror films to be slick modern productions . ( And recommended for a dark and stormy night with the lights out ) 6 . ( 6 for IMDb purposes )
427709	3079504	486028	6.0	Good but should have been better . I'm very ambivalent about it	Cops and an insurance investigator try to stop a serial bomber who torments with riddles and has now set his sight on a college student . Odd story with style that lacks and real characters you can care about . Its not a bad movie , far from it but this could have and should have been a great film , all that would have been required would be to give us real people to hang out with instead we get cyphers and cut outs . It keeps you watching but it never fully engages you . I highly doubt that you'll remember ever seeing it after the end credits roll . Worth a shot on cable .
427002	3079504	260838	6.0	Despite not speaking the language I enjoyed this Bollywood attempt at a horror movie	I have to say at the outset that my impressions of this film are filtered through two limiting factors . First I saw this with out subtitles so other than the odd snatches of dialog in English I had no idea what was being said . Second I had never , until now , seen a Bollywood film from start to finish . The main plot , and there's a couple of side plots , has to do with a man and his wife who take a job as caretakers at a place called Dak Bangla . This is a big mansion house which the neighbors don't like much because weird things are going on there . Once there weird things start to happen to them . Before long they are visited by some female relatives and one of the girls boyfriends . In investigating the place the girl with her boyfriend find a large book which explains the history of the place and about the creation of a mummy . Eventually the mummy gets loose and the nastiness ensues . My reaction to this movie was , at first , " this is pretty good " . The horror elements are handled extremely well and had there been released in the US this probably could have made a bit of money with the horror crowd . Its very much like the low budget horror films of the 1970's and 1980's , with a few Euro-horror twists from the 1960's thrown in . The horror parts of the film I really liked . The problem is that this is a Bollywood production so there are some weird asides . Romance , comedy and music all come into play and they take away from the main thrust . I may seem like a cultural heathen , but while I was prepared for the " misplaced asides " I didn't think they would be this distracting . There is a disco dance number with a guy who looks like Elvis . Another number , with a seeming S & M overtone comes right after what looked to be a rape . " A song , now ? " , I thought . It boggled my mind . As I admitted earlier I know I lost a great deal by not speaking the language . All of the humor was gone , as was any real understanding of what was really going on . While this is a movie you can watch without knowing the language , you do lose all of the details as a result . I liked it , I didn't love it . I did enjoy it enough to know that were I able to get a subtitled or English dubbed version I would certainly try it again . My rating of is based upon the frustration of having to see it without the proper understanding of what I was seeing . If you don't have language or movie cultural problems do see this movie , since its a good old fashioned horror movie .
428310	3079504	137146	6.0	Worth a look if you run across it	Rob Lowe stars in the story of a decent guy who gets mixed up with some spoiled rich kids who decide to mess with him because they can ( They are rich with parents who are connected to keep them out of trouble and too young to have serious consequences . ) As Lowe's life spirals out of control and things fall apart he decides to take things in to his own hands . Good but unremarkable thriller is still worth a look because the villain is deliciously evil and because the rest of the cast manages to sell a plot that stays a little too close to the well worn path . I wouldn't pay any more than a rental for it ( This was a TV movie and not a big screen production so its not big and spectacular ) , but if you do run across it you could do worse
428494	3079504	241527	6.0	What I say doesn't matter	I'm not a fan of the books . The ones I read seem like Roald Dahl wannabes . To me the books were young adult fiction that seems like young adult fiction . This the , film version of the first book is actually pretty good , but suffers painfully from the fact that it attempts to get everything in the book on the screen . I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel . If you want to see a good , but not great movie , and to get a faithful feeling for one of the most successful series of books ever made without having to days reading the books then by all means watch this , just expect frequent draggy spots .
429062	3079504	299854	6.0	Standard revenge tale enlivened by a great cast	A pilots pregnant wife is killed by a band of thugs who break into their home . The gang is caught and sent off to prison . Wanting to see that " justice " is done the pilot stages his own death and then gets himself arrested so he can hunt the killers in the prisons into which they have been sent . To be honest the story is a bit clichéd with the plot taking some obvious paths once things are set in motion . Normally that would be a bad thing but here the film works largely thanks to a very good cast of mostly unknown actors . The stand out is Andy Serkis , best known for playing Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies . Here he's the head of the nasty band and his vileness seems to drip off the screen . If you want to know why Peter Jackson chose him to play the tortured creature in the big budgeted epic look no further . Serkis isn't on screen much until the final portion of the film , but his evilness in the early part of the film hangs over everything like a dark cloud . Definitely worth a look for those who want an undemanding thriller , and those who want to see what Andy Serkis is capable of when he isn't doing just a computer generated character . 6 . .
426887	3079504	416496	6.0	mindless fun	Caught this on one of the multitudinous HBO channels . When a bad American played by Dwight Yokum forcibly takes control of various property in early 20th century Mexico for the building of a railway , Penelope Cruz and Selma Hayek band together and begin robbing banks to get the money to fight the bad guy . Its a bit more complicated than that but its enough to give you an idea as to what the premise is . Its an amusing romp written in part by Luc Besson ( which explains the smart ass tone ) thats never too serious and never too far from some action sequence . I liked this movie a great deal since its perfectly mindless and the sort of thing you could wander in and out of and still be able to follow . If there are any serious flaws its that more than once there seems to have been some scenes or some minor exposition . removed since more than once I had the feeling that I missed something as characters moved from place to place . Wonderfully acted by the two leads , not to mention Yokum , Steve Zahn and a very funny Sam Sheppard ( as a bank robber entrusted to train the pair of bandidas in his trade ) Far from the best movie ever made it is amusing , and perfect cable fare where all its flaws will be more easily forgiven . Worth a look for action fans and those who like light humorous movies .
428312	3079504	377471	6.0	Not Get Shorty , but not a disaster either	The sequel to Get Shory has Chili Palmer taking on the music business . Its not as good as the first film , but if taken on its own is a good time passer . The problem here is two fold . First the film has a running gag about hating sequels , which would be fine if it was just a joke and didn't extend to the film making . Few of the actors in this film seem to be doing more than walking through the film for the cash or as a joke and it shows . The second problem is that there is way way too much going on and way too many people doing it . It seems to me that every time that someone of note shows up the movie has to stop to give them their couple of minutes on screen . Usually the material is decent , but it slows the pace down . I kept wanting to speed things up . That said I did like the film , but regret having paid movie theater prices to do so . This is a rental , not something you pay ten bucks to see . If you get the chance to rent it or see it on cable give it a shot . Just don't expect an equal to Get Shorty .
428530	3079504	51453	6.0	Great cast delivering big laughs saves a too by the numbers attempt at comedy	As a bunch of new recruits comes in a drill sergeant bets his comrades that he will produce the top platoon before he retires in ten weeks time . Unfortunately for him he ends up saddled with a grand bunch of losers who are probably drive him in sane well before he ever retires . This is the first of the Carry On films , the long running series of low brow British comedies that poke fun at everyone and everything . Most of the jokes are secondary to the plot , or rather the plot is simply an excuse to move the cast from one gag set up to the next , and really isn't important . I had never knowingly watched a Carry On film until tonight . I'm not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing . Certainly the cast is game , its lead by William Hartnell as the Sergeant of the title . Hartnell is best known as the first Dr Who , and he made a career out of playing this sort of part . He is joined by a stalwart cast of British comedians , who are all expert at what they do , which is produce a great many laughs ( I have no idea who any of them are even though all of their faces are very familiar from other films and TV shows . ) I'm torn about the film . Taken as a series of set pieces this is a screamingly funny movie . The jokes are the sort that are not only laugh out loud funny , but will make you laugh so hard that you'll go light headed . On the basis of the jokes its easy to understand why this film spawned 31 films , several TV specials and stage shows . Unfortunately as a movie , with a plot this film is the pits . Its awful . None of it really hangs together as the numerous character plot lines cross and recross to very little effect . It almost sinks the movie since the good stuff clashes badly with the bad stuff . Still I haven't laughed this hard in a good while , which makes rating this movie difficult . If you're a fan of British comedy its worth a look . Its also worth a look if you like military humor or don't mind a comedy that has a a bad plot line , but very funny jokes . Rent it or borrow it , but don't buy it ( at least until you've seen it an know if you like it ) .
427540	3079504	56507	7.0	Tons of Plot , Tons of Action , Just a Tad Slow .	A Roman Tribune , left behind to mind a subdued city , decides to go against orders and ends up becoming a tyrant in order to spread the glory of Rome . The tribune falls in love with a girl who is in turn in love with the leader of the rebellion . This movie is interesting in that the villain isn't really bad , he's just misguided . From his point of view , one that is truly understandable , he's doing the right thing . This gives the movie a nice shade of gray missing from most other epics of this sort . My one question is why is this called Alone Against Rome when no one is really alone against Rome and there isn't even a central character ?
429080	3079504	52611	7.0	Better than I remembered it	Giant Behemoth surprised me . Catching the film really from the first frame for the first time in years I was shocked by just how damn good the movie is . Owing more to the British thrillers such as the Quatermass films and the stark black and white horror films of Hammer ( X The Unknown ) or things like the Day the Earth Caught Fire ( which while released 2 years later has similar feel ) or Corridors of Blood , this is for a good chunk of the film a dark detective story of sorts as the monster remains hidden and the scientists try to figure out whats going on . There is complexity of the story , fish kills , radiation and a sense that this is a larger problem , that is lacking from most American films of the time period and the genre . Strangely , the monster , which always bothered me , actually looked pretty good . If you look at the monster itself I think you'll see that compared to the Beast from 20000 fathoms , this is the better monster . if you look at the design and the skin texture the monster actually looks realer than Beast which seems to be more a block of clay . the problem here is that O'Brien's animation isn't very good at times . A throw back to his 1920's work on the Lost World ( watch the way the neck and head move ) , its clear that O'Brien was regressing from his peak on King Kong ( Mighty Joe Young doesn't count , Harryhausen actually animated most of that ) . To be certain part of the problem is that speed was required , Behemoth had a limited budget so it had to be done fast as possible , but ultimately O'Brien wasn't that creative an animator ( he may have been the father of the technique but his children made it into something ) . Luckily the monster is shown in shadow and darkness frequently so we can't always see whats going on , which is good since it adds a sense of mystery to the proceedings that Beast is lacking . By no means a " great film " behemoth is actually a better film than I think its given credit for . I think had the monster been changed or better handled this would have had a reputation beyond the earlier Beast . For a great double feature watch Beast from 20 , 000 Fathoms after this for a nice follow up ( Events in Beast are kind of mentioned in the final fade out )
428498	3079504	167190	7.0	They Got Everything Right But the Pacing	Having been a Hellboy fan for years I've been looking forward to the movie since it was announced . Now that I've seen it I'm of mixed minds . First off its one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic ever put on the screen where everything looks and feels right . The trouble is that the term leadenly paced doesn't do it justice , despite action sequence after action sequence this movie fails to move at all . Yes , all of the inter-personal relationships are scenes are fine , but anything that has to do with action or the villains is motionless . After an hour I was fighting a desperate battle to remain awake and the person I saw this with had to keep being nudged because they were snoring . What a slow slow movie . Wait for video and then keep the remote handy .
426795	3079504	74113	7.0	Adults only retelling of the Lewis Carroll tale is a great deal of fun	Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image . Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes , this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day . Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs . Its an naughty little tale for adults . If you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex , which is how I first saw the film years ago on cable TV . The relatively recent home video release on DVD put back the sex ( in horribly grainy inserted clips ) which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around . If you're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy I can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion .
429086	3079504	454824	7.0	Clichéd but often spectacular tale of pilots during the First World War	A good but unremarkable story of the Lafayette Escadrille in World War One . This is the story of a bunch of men who volunteered to fly for the French prior to the American entry into the war . Its the usual cross section of guys , most on the run from something who learn to come together in the skies of France . What can I say I liked it . Its not anything remotely like brain surgery , just the story of some guys living and dying during war time . The performances are fine and the action is exciting , though I'm really getting tired of everything being done by computers . I know its cheaper but I never really accepted that anyone was really flying because I knew that it was all make believe , spectacular make believe , but make believe none the less . If the film has any real flaw is that its a bit too long for what it is . Running close to two and a half hours this movie could easily be trimmed down . Length or no , this is a good movie for a slow Sunday afternoon . It probably won't win any awards but it will keep you entertained . ( There have been some complaints that the film lifts sequences from Howard Hughes Hell's Angels . I think it probably does , but I don't think that its fair to complain about it since George Lucas did the exact same thing in his Star Wars films and no one said a word )
427107	3079504	52805	7.0	Good 1950's scifi	1959 movie about a test pilot who disobeys orders and ends up flying higher than he should - becoming the title in the process . He also returns to earth looking like the burnt casserole man . Filmed in England yet set in White Sands New Mexico this is a slow but decent little scifi thriller about an experiment that goes horribly wrong . Its the sort of thing you put on late at night to fall asleep to or laugh at or drift off in the ways that black and white movies of the period are prone to make you do . Not one of my favorites I recently picked it up as part of a Criterion box set called Madmen and Monsters of four lesser films from the late 1950's packaged together with a host of typical extras . Why Criterion would choose these films was a bit beyond me until I realized that all of the films were made by the same producers and were the follow ups to Fiend Without a Face ( the crawling brain film ) which Criterion put out several years ago . The transfer and such is sterling and the commentary is very informative dealing with the film and the producers life as exploitation filmmakers and to be honest listening to it boosted my appreciation of the film . Its a good way to see the film - though to be honest I'm still not convinced the film needed a Criterion edition-especially since its pricey set ( which I got greatly reduced ) will limit peoples exposure to the film .
427451	3079504	140659	7.0	Good adventure yarn	A woman hires a boat captain to take her into the Amazon where her father has gone missing . Along the way the villains end up kidnapping her and its up to the Captain to to rescue her . Very good adventure yarn with some great action , some clever turns and one of the nastiest piranha attacks ever caught on film . ( I don't care if its just an animal that gets eaten it will make your skin crawl as it goes on and on and on . ) This is a near perfect rainy day sort of movie . If there is any real flaw its that the print I saw seems to have been trimmed down , probably to fit into slot on TV with commercials . I'm guessing this because the print has a couple of jumps in story that are too egregious to be anything other than intentionally caused . ( The print I saw also has the ear marks of being a black and white version of a color movie , which again would lead me to believe that this was once part of some TV package of Euro-films that were sold to local stations ) Cut or not this is a film thats worth a bag of popcorn and a soda on a rainy afternoon .
428264	3079504	29942	7.0	very good but very hokey	Nominally the founding of Boys Town by Father Flanagan and his push to prove that there are no bad boys . Its as syrupy and sweet as they come . I doubt very much that the film is very close to what happened since everything in Spencer Tracy's hands is bound to be okay . I have no idea why but I was moved to mistiness a couple of times . Of course there is never any doubt that Boys Town will grow and thrive and of course Mickey Rooney's bad boy with a heart of gold is much too good to be true and is bound to do the right thing in the end . Still its a grand little film of the sort they don't make any more ( and would be laughed off the screen if they did ) . Absolutely worth a look see when it reappears on TV or as a rental . ( my only real problem is that Spencer Tracy won his second Oscar in a row for his portrait of Father Flanagan , either they really liked him or the other nominees weren't very good since the role is truly unremarkable , well played , but nothing special . )
429133	3079504	338751	7.0	Good but not great Bio-pic	So what are we to make of the highly touted bio of Howard Hughes . Certainly this is one of the most lavish and spectacular films of the last few years . It looks great is fantastically put together and acted , but somehow something seems missing . As the film unspooled I was never bored but I didn't really care . I didn't really connect with the film . Yes , the film is dramatic but its never involving . I never felt that there was a reason to be watching other than it was a well made film that was somewhat interesting . I'm sure that had it not been a big award winning film that I would have liked it more , but for a film thats up for and won tons of awards I'm left puzzled , a feeling I have about every other Oscar Best Picture nominated film . See the film , its not bad , and do so on the big screen if possible . Just expect to like the film and not love it .
426789	3079504	296242	7.0	Entertaining look at the stars of Chinese martial arts films	Good martial arts movie over view that is a good mix of interviews , narration and fight clips . The film gives some background on the history of martial arts in China before moving on to a loose overview of martial arts on film . Focusing on the various stars that have emerged in the genre over the years the film is arranged approximate ( but not complete ) order in which an actor rose to prominence . The interviews are with people like Gordon Liu , Jackie Chan , Jim Kelly , Bruce Li and other stars whose clips we see as they talk about making movies . There is also a long segment on Bruce Lee where former students are interviewed . Entertaining , this film compliments nicely some of the better films on the subject Cinema of Vengeance and IFC film on Kung Fu films by fleshing out some of the people only touched on in those documentaries , as well as showing lots of extended film clips of action sequences that are actually worth watching . Worth keeping an eye out for , especially since it can be found in bargain DVD bins for under five bucks .
428751	3079504	985699	7.0	If only I could have forgotten how it was going to end I would have thought this one of the best of the year	Bryan Singers film about the plot to kill Hitler is a very good one . ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Wonderfully acted , especially when it gets going , it has one of the best ensemble casts I've seen . This is beautiful to look at with a real sense of being in the Nazi world . And it is at times a taut film about a plot to kill the Fuhrer ( I know you can all here the " but " coming , so I won't disappoint you ) BUT the film has one large problem , we know how it turns out . Forgive me for saying that unless you really don't know your history you know the plan fails and everyone dies . Short of them rewriting history there is one and only one way this can go , and its not really a happy one . This doesn't mean there is no tension , there is , it just means there are no surprises except in the details . For me the films inability to transcend the fact we know it ends badly keeps it from being a being a great film and instead making it only a good one . Its is possible to make a great film about a failed event , one need only look at Khartoum or the Alamo to see two films that hold you in such away that you forget the ending . Don't get me wrong its a good film , I just wish they had made me forget the ending at the start . ( Counter point recent films where I knew the ending and didn't care or forgot it in the flow : Milk , Che , Frost / Nixon )
428303	3079504	844708	7.0	Really good but unnecessary remake is one of the best of the recent glut of retread horror films and a fine horror film on its own	Remake of the Wes Craven horror classic ( considered by some ) that was based on Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring . The basic plot is simple . A band of villains brutalize a couple of girls out in the woods . When they need to take shelter they do so at the home of a nice family . All is going well until the family discovers that the visitors tortured their daughter and they decide to see that justice is done . Well made revenge flick with amped up violence and nastiness was an odd viewing experience for me . yes its well done and tense , with villains that really need killing , but now 35 years down the road the original has been riffed on so many times that there is little thats new here except the level of violence . I don't see why , other than for money ( despite no prospect for a sequel ) , why the original had to be remade . Then again I'm thrilled that here was a remake that doesn't stink . I mean how many horror films from the 1970's and 80's have been remade badly recently ? Yes its good . Yes its exactly what you think its going to be . No its not required viewing . If you like this sort of thing and know what you're getting into give it a shot .
427719	3079504	157583	7.0	Solid little thriller	I can't say how accurate this film is , after all its based on a novel and not history , but this tale of undoing the German Enigma code during the Second World War is a good way to spend a couple of hours . I had read mixed reviews of this film , but its recently showed up on cable and having run across it a couple of times I've found that I'm stopping to watch it each time I do so . Its much better than the poor reviews I read made it out to be . The cast is great without a bad performance in the bunch . I recommend this film . Its not something that you need search out , but should you stumble upon it , as I have been doing so , I do suggest that you stop and watch .
426804	3079504	75059	7.0	Good political thriller is worth trying	I'm trying to figure out what this film is doing in a DVD collection called Tales of Voodoo where its paired with a movie called Scorpion Thunderbolt ( which is about a killer snake-man ) since the two films have nothing in common and this film has nothing to do with voodoo . I've tried to work out the connection , but I'm not sure I'll ever figure it out . I'm just glad it happened since I would not have run across this very good tale of a political prisoner on the run . Jason Miller stars as the prisoner who manages to escape from a prison work detail when an accident on the road gives him a chance to flee . He is pursued and is recaptured , but circumstance again gives him an opportunity for freedom , which he takes , only he still finds himself being chased by one of the dogs . Far from as simple or as simple minded as I've made it out to be this is a good thriller / allegory . Things don't always go the way you expect ( especially if you're like me and were expecting a schlocky exploitation film ) . This is a movie thats both entertaining and enlightening . Certainly worth trying f you're in the mood for something other than typical exploitation fare .
428559	3079504	346899	7.0	Very good adaptation of the tale even if it shows its stage bound origins .	This version of Jekyll and Hyde has its origins in a stage production of the novel . This is part of the films flaw in that the acting seems to have been pulled right off the stage rather than coming from real life . This shouldn't put you off from seeing this movie since its quite good and is possibly one of the finer adaptations of the story . Sticking closer to the book , or so it seems , it tries to unravel the weird story with Jeykll and Hyde taking up less of the limelight . This is two friends trying to hash out whats going on . Its a refreshing take on the tale and adds nice shading to everything thats going on . Out side of the stage acting that some people use this film really has no flaws other than a bit too much of the chroma-key or blue screen effects that it uses to supplement its backgrounds . There's nothing wrong with it , but it seems to have been over used sand at times I felt like I was watching a video game rather than a movie . Ultimately this is a film to put on your must see list especially if you want to see a good version of a literary classic .
427644	3079504	820466	7.0	Better than the title suggests	Good B-scifi film with an awful title . The plot has an alien race trying to build a worm hole terminal on earth so they can leave their dying planet and forcibly take over the earth . They only thing stopping them is an single alien who wants revenge . What can I say its turn your brain off time at the old homestead . The best way to describe this is a way better than average SCIFI Channel original film . Its a better than average TV movie that just works with in its limits and goes . Certainly its nothing you haven't seen before but its sense of seriousness makes it worth your time in front of the TV screen . If there is any flaw its the invulnerability the aliens have , it kind of takes the edge off the danger . Still if this had a better title people would be eating this up .
428778	3079504	366548	7.0	Great first half is spoiled by a contrived second	What an odd movie . Actually this is two movies , one great and the other just okay . The first half of this film is the story of Mumbles a penguin who can't sing but can dance . This is the source of most of the promos and its what the studio is pushing as what the film is about . Can the penguin find his heart song if he can't sing ? Well thats the first half of the movie . The second half of the movie is an odd left turn thats foreshadowed , but doesn't really belong , and thats Mumbles attempts to find the " aliens " and make them stop taking the fish . Its a weird detour that puts mumbles in a zoo . I really liked the first half of the film . Its an infectious story about finding your place in the world . Sure its been done to death but the characters and the music push this film from run of the mill into something special . Its a great one hour movie . The second half of this film is another story . Its not the second half of the film its a second film tacked on to make up the running time . The problem is that once Mumbles ends up in the zoo everything is contrived . What happens is done just to get to the ending . It doesn't work . I went from loving the movie to liking it . Yes I know I'm being vague but to really explain why it doesn't work would require explaining the ending and thats not fair . Lets just say that they should have stopped at an hour . Story aside this is probably the best animated computer film ( technically ) I've seen all year . Its amazing . Its simply beautiful to look at and its clear that the animators took great pains to make a visually arresting film . The performances are top notch , with Robin Williams pure joy in two roles . And of course the music is wonderful , with some really nice rearrangements that are so clever it takes you a few minutes to realize what the song is . I highly recommend the first half of this movie . Its magical . The second part has moments , but mostly its contrived nonsense you'll want to push out of your head ( though not the ten thousand penguins dancing to Stevie Wonder ) . Worth a trip to the multiplex if you can ignore the second half . First half is . The second is . Split the difference of 7 for IMDb purposes
428690	3079504	1007028	7.0	Better than the title suggests	Sweet and funny vulgar love story about two friends forever who only realize they love each other when they finally sleep together for a porno film they are making to pay the rent . The first couple of minutes had me groaning , wondering what I had gotten myself into but somehow it all come together and the repartee between the two leads won me over . Its an utterly charming film with four letter words and talk about adult toys . What can I say I've finally found a Seth Rogen film I like . I can only chalk up its less than stellar performance to the title . Yes you really do what to see this . 7 .
429059	3079504	337945	8.0	A wonderful find	Told in flashback , a woman left alone for the holidays decides to surprise her fiancé by joining him in Switzerland . When she arrives and finds he was never there , she manages to track him to South America . From there it becomes a wild adventure as she hooks up with a scruffy reporter to venture into the jungle to find the man she loves . Okay , let me start by saying that this type of thing has been done before both better and worse . The first film that pops first to mind is Romancing the Stone because thats the current yard stick for films of this sort . While perhaps not as memorable as Romancing the Stone , Coronado is a damn close on the enjoyment level . Best of all Coronado doesn't take it self seriously at all . I groaned at the opening firing squad scene , only to lose any reservations in the next scene as our heroine began to tell her story to two guards in a jail . At that point it became obvious really fast that this movie had tongue in cheek and was out to have a good time , period . No its not perfect , but who cares , its fun . I can't recommend this film enough to anyone who wants a confection that may disappear from your mind not long after seeing it , but will make you smile while you watch it . for those who accept this for what it is .
428002	3079504	1119194	8.0	Wonderful	Shuhei Amamiya son of a famous concert pianist transfers with his mother to a school in the country so his mom can take care of his grandmother . He wants nothing better than to become a famous pianist like his dad . When he's threatened by some of the other boys to play a broken piano in the forest thats said to be played by ghosts or else , he's rescued by the poor as dirt Kai , who claims the piano works since its his piano . When Kai takes his new friend to see his piano , Amamiya finds that the piano does work , and his friend is a great , though completely untrained , pianist in his own right . Magical story of following your heart and finding ones " piano " . This is a story for anyone who's ever tried to be good at something but found it difficult , anyone who's found it easy and the magic of friendship . When the film started I wasn't sure this was going to be anything special , then the kids began to talk like kids and the pure joy and love of music was expressed and the film started to become something special . These are real people trying to get along in life , and deal with school , friendship and a competition where one has to wonder is being technically perfect when other people feel things so much more . I don't know what to say . . . its a really good film . It makes you feel good . Its not perfect but you really won't care . For a good chunk of it the film didn't need to be animated until things become magic and take off . . You really want to see this if for no other reason you'll find out why Kai become Wendy to the confusion of a good number of people . This film needs a wide release so lots of people can find their own piano . somewhere around
428449	3079504	83100	8.0	One of the best Holmes adaptations	Russian TV version of the story that was filmed as part of a series and then released elsewhere as a stand alone film . For the most part an excellent adaption of the story with a real genuine chemistry and warmth between Homes and Watson that would seem to predate the Jermey Brett series . This feels the way the stories should feel . If there are any flaws in the film it would be that Henry Baskerville is not English raised in North America rather he's decidedly Russian in manner , The moors , while very ominous-possibly the most in any adaptation-are not quite England and the last " flaw " is that the film is overly faithful to the story and runs two and a half hours . They are minor flaws and should not keep you from watching one of the better Holmes films made .
427696	3079504	87317	8.0	Werner Herzog attempts to come to terms with the climber as the climber prepares to climb two mountains	Werner Herzog's film of Reinhold Messner's attempt to climb two 8000 + meter twin peaks in succession is an intriguing look at what actually goes into a climb and the mindset of those who climb . Werner Herzog follows as Messner picks his porters and then heads to the mountains , all the while peppering his subject with questions about why and how and what his thoughts are . It's a really good look at one of the best in the sport and manages to get into Messner's head in away most documentaries never do . There is something about watching Messner talk about the tragedies and his instructions about what to do if tragedy strikes that seems at times to be way too personal . It's very clear that Messner knows it's all foolhardy but he still does it . A word of warning , this is not about the actual climb as such . Herzog never leaves base camp and what we of the climb is limited to the shots taken from camp or to the brief footage taken by the climbers to document their achievement . This is a film about the people climbing and not the climb . ( the film also starts a bit slow but picks up after about ten minutes ) . Recommended
428885	3079504	1175491	8.0	Masterful look at the interior life of a man in the White House	Oliver Stone's film about the life of George W Bush seems to be a simple look at the life of W from his college days to the invasion of Iraq and how it all went wrong despite the best efforts of our central character . The film doesn't deal in a great deal of details , it does not follow every minute of every event-in deed the films present ins the days leading up to the invasion , and then flashes back to seeming " key " moments in Bush's life , some seemingly innocuous . However they are not innocuous they are somehow key to the interior landscape of the man . It is that interior landscape that is important to the film , not the details of everyday life . Look at how the film shows us the people in Bush's life . They are all drawn in a simplified way that Bush sees the world . His father is the master he can't please ; his mother is loving but on the fringes ; Laura , at first is a challenging three dimensional woman who recedes into the cheer leader and prop ; Cheney the man who wants to have his way ; Rove the brain ; Colin Powell , the complex voice of reason that no one understands and who gets ignored because he's the smartest one in the room and its easier then dealing with the reality he puts forward . But the way the film is put together there is a second level there , we have the people existing in the way that Bush sees the world but we also have the times when there is another level . Watch the performances watch how what some one says indicates one thing but how they act indicates something else . Look at how Laura recedes and her role becomes more and more the " mother " or prop up for George her body seems to indicate much more going on ? we don't see the more overtly because George doesn't . This is a film about how Bush sees the world , not how the world sees him . ( why else do we keep having Bush go back to centerfold in the baseball stadium , its Bush escaping ) . Many have leveled charges against the film in that it makes Bush too likable and that its not tough enough in judging him . First off how could George not come off as likable to some degree . One can't become elected to the presidency without someone liking him . There has to be something there that makes people want to follow him , or at least have him lead them . As for not being tough enough , I don't think that's the point of the film . It wasn't made to be a witch hunt , rather it was to show us what sort of man the man who lead us for the eight years was and how that lead us to where we are . The film does have a great deal to say about those around our commander and chief , and its not very pleasing with pretty much everyone in the cabinet , except Powell getting raked over the coals . To be certain the film might have been tougher on them , but then again the film isn't focused on them and their deeds or misdeeds . As the film stands it's a close to great film . First because it has everyone annoyed at how it portrays its main character . If Stone had pleased everyone then there is no doubt he did something wrong . So add it to the list of Stone bio's that have rankled the populace . Stone has made a film that makes you think . Whether you like it or not the film will challenge your perceptions and force you think about what you are seeing ; you will be forced to think about what Stone is showing you and wonder why . And while its looks simple , its not simplistic , there are no real easy answers . Its a film that will require multiple viewings . I knew near the end that a second viewing was in order since I was only just beginning to understand what I was seeing . And the film's greatness comes from the performances . Everyone is very good in their roles , especially Josh Brolin who eerily inhabits the persona of George W Bush in ways that are scary . One pretty much forgets that its Brolin up there on the screen by the time the film is a half an hour old . One can hope that at the very least an Oscar nomination will be coming his way . If there is any real flaw it is the one noteness of Bush's vision . I can't fully blame Stone for making some the characters so one note , particularly James Cromwell as George Bush Sr since the black and white nature of the world is key to under standing how the world operates . " I have to better better than Dad " has made some of Bush's world rather dull . Still the film is important . It's the first film that I've run across , be it documentary or drama that has tried to get inside the head of Bush with out demonizing him , claiming mental illness or unmitigated genius . Here is Bush the man , warts and all . It is a painful reminder that we are all fallible . I'm not sure where the film will fare a few years down the road , but I do think it is a film that deserves to be seen in it entirety and seen by everyone interested in where we've been and where we're headed .
428528	3079504	370032	8.0	Its form over content - but if you click with it this is a really good action flick	First off , its the type of movie I hate-form over content , but I loved this film . Simply put , its the commercial / trailer only 90 minutes long . Set in a world where a virus that was genetically altered by the military in order to make super humans , turns into something else and alters anyone infected into something other than human - a " vampire " . the plot has Violet , a " vampire " , stealing a human " weapon " and then finding that its not what she , or her fellow vampires thought it was , nor is the situation in the world . This is a mostly flashy visuals with just enough plot to hold it together . Its great stuff which operates nicely with in its own on screen world . It helps that this is a movie in motion , its basically a 90 minute chase with some fights and exposition thrown in from time to time . The fights defy gravity and make your jaw hang open in disbelief ( the good kind ) . The wonder of it all is to due to clever deus ex machina or mc guffins with in the story ( vampirism and neat gadgets ) and they help keep things moving along at a good clip . Actually the film has enough slack to explain ( or not ) pretty much everything satisfactorily until the final twenty minutes or so when it becomes clear that some one removed several lines of exposition . Its still good , but you will feel that you've missed something . I have to say that I like that the film doesn't feel it has to show you everything . some of the fights happen in the dark or bodies will pile up just out of view . Its a ballsy film that allows that to happen since it trusts its audience to fill in what just happened based on the after math . Fight fans may squawk , but I liked it . I accepted the film on its own terms and allowed it to work its magic so I liked it . However the form over content thing may not work for you , in which case you'll hate it . Either way its worth a look , especially if you like the way the trailer and commercials look .
428268	3079504	25204	8.0	Nifty mystery thriller is almost like watching a novel	During a masked party Stephen Kester is found dead in the closet of his room , three stab wounds in his back . Suspicion falls on everyone at the party , especially Kester's granddaughter and her fiancée who fled the house after disabling all of the other cars and cutting the phone lines . As the police investigate they are shadowed and helped along by a mystery writer . Good Long Island based murder mystery novel keeps you guessing until almost the end of the film . Its not until a few knots about motive are untangled that you'll know who did it and why . Its a neatly plotted mystery that I think works better for lifting some of the dialog from the novel since it seems to move the film along at a good clip , even if most of the actions are simply in wide circles around the mansion . The cast is full of B-movie stalwarts who all fill their roles with a good amount doubt as to their possible guilt or innocence . Even nominal lead Charles Starrett as Michael Tracy , the mystery writer , manages to keep you guessing as to whether he did it or not . A solid and very enjoyable mystery . It maybe light and fluffy but it will entertain you .
429026	3079504	117262	8.0	Very good look at Welles the man , his relationship with Hollywood and unfinished projects	This is a loving film essay on Orson Welles and his unfinished films . Its an interesting look at the man who was just trying to make the films he wanted to on his own terms . Made with the assistance of Welles ' longtime companion Oja Kodar this film lets us see a number of his unrealized projects for the first time . Its a treat for anyone who has been interested in Orson Welles and heard stories of these lost treasures ; or for any one curious to what end he was putting the money got from his numerous film and television roles . While I'm not sure what I would have thought of some of the films ( The Dreamers for example ) I find that I'm very interested in where he was going with other ( his Moby Dick , which consisted of him simply reciting passages from the book is an interesting idea ) . I especially loved some of the short humorous bits that Welles put together , his Churchill film is very funny , as his is bit with two English tailors . As a person who has been very critical of Welles of late , due in large part to extreme disillusionment with his Don Quixote ( which I found to be a crashing bore ) I find that this film re-awakened my respect for the man . Its not a perfect film , most of the pieces we see only awaken a desire to see more of the unfinished films and at times it seems to go on too long . Still this is a must see if you're interested in Welles or cinema , especially its lost treasures .
428603	3079504	443543	8.0	A curl up by the fire " I'm going to tell you a really good story " sort of a movie	Nothing is what it seems . Mostly . Clearly one of the most special movies of the year , here is a movie that proves Edward Norton and Paul Giammatti are not as over rated as some poor recent choices made it seem ( What a joy it is to see them spar ) . This is the story of Eisenheim the magician who comes to Vienna to do magic and falls in love with a woman above his station . Thats the party line and here I'm willing to tow it since to do otherwise would involve lengthy explanations that would tell you too much before hand . Absolutely one of the best looking , best acted , best made movies of the year . Its a wonderful movie that will thrill your sense of wonder . Its like curling up with a good book on a dark night before a roaring fire . Its a wonderful drama with romance and laughter and danger and magic , both of the how do they do that sort and the type that tickles your heart . This is one to see . Absolutely .
428243	3079504	63611	8.0	More important today then when it was made	Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast ( of what country isn't specified ) . Raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports . As they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them . Bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less . Its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age . This is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head , " what do I do now ? " . As an intellectual exercise the film is top notch , this is a film that will make you think . As an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving . I was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops . ( I should state that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table , however I have never been moved by his films . I am not a " fan " . I always sided with Fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films ) . Reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war , for most of us , is just a thing on a TV screen .
427063	3079504	452056	8.0	Well done look at Tarzan and the six films that Weissmuller and O'Sullivan did for MGM . Good fun even for non fans of the series	Made for Turner Classic movies and packaged in with the Warner Brothers DVD release of the first six MGM Tarzan movies this is an over view of the character of Tarzan from his creation through to the production of Tarzan's New York Adventure . It's a very informative look at the world's favorite jungle man as seen in 6 MGM movies . This is your typical Warner classic documentary with lots of talking heads ( Rudy Behlmer , Robert Osborne , Johnny Weissmuller Jr not to mention Edgar Rice Burroughs experts ) plus tons of stills and clips . Its a really nice over view of the MGM series that reveals many new stories and corrects many falsely held ones ( for example Burroughs actually liked the films , I had always heard otherwise ) . It's a good amount of information told in an entertaining way . While I'm not a huge fan of this bunch of Tarzan films , I find them fun , but somewhat too silly , I did find that my interest has been piqued enough by what I learned to go back and re-watch the films ( I'm dying to see if I notice the fake elephant ears in the films themselves ) . If there is a flaw to this documentary its that the film runs out of steam towards the end . For what ever reason the 80 minute running time is too long for whats up on screen . Minor complaint aside this if absolutely worth seeing , especially if you've ever seen any of the films , or wondered about whether Maureen O'Sullivan was the one doing the nude swim scene .
426952	3079504	455782	8.0	Let the film take you where it will and you'l have a good time	Based on a true story of a trio of Journalists looking for a war criminal in the former Yugoslavia . The Original group included Jon Krakauer , in the movie we have Terrence Howard and Richard Gere . Where originally it started as a bunch of journalists getting drunk and deciding to go out and find the bad guys , here we have Gere as a washed up TV reporter convincing his old camera man and a network executive ( who got the job because of nepotism ) that he can get an interview with " the Fox " if they are willing to go along with him . They go and things instantly begin to go side ways as nothing is as it seems and no one believes they aren't with the CIA . Not to put too fine a point on it I really liked this film a great deal . Its witty intelligent with lots of likable characters and a real sense of both humor and reality . Its probably three quarters of one of the most enjoyable films of the year ( even with the nastiness . ) What can I say I'm a sucker for great buddy films and Terrence Howard and Richard Gere have an ease when together that makes you certain that they have been friends for decades . Its magical . If there is a problem with the film its that the film kind of loses steam toward the end . Somewhere the need for an " ending " kind of gets in the way of things and the film begins to be a bit less . . . I don't know , fun . Don't get me wrong its still better than many other recent films , but its just disappointing that things have to be " neat " . Of course the pre-final credits explanation of whats real and what isn't a scream . See this movie , thats all I have to say . See it and go with its vibe and I think you'll have a good time . And forgive me for being spotty about things since I'm trying not to say too much since not knowing what happens is part of the joy .
426994	3079504	421239	8.0	Fast paced thriller is over and done before you have time to think about it	I'm not sure how much to say about this movie . The plot concerning what happens when boy meets girl on a red eye flight , is wafer thin but tasty enough to keep you eating until the very end ( I suggest you not think about it too much and just let it do what its gonna do ) . Some reviews have been sparing with the details saying that its a movie best experienced than heard about . I tend to agree . Wes Craven has made a perfectly paced movie with nary a wasted frame anywhere . This moves like the wind and keeps you on the edge of your seat for its brief running time . From the second this movie starts until the end you're hooked like a heroine junkie . Its like being on a white knuckle thrill ride with no escape . Craven again proves that he's a master film maker despite some recent misfires . This is a film that hearkens back to the great days of B-movies when studios turned out small little thrillers , like the original Narrow Margin , which packed a large number of thrills into just over an hour . Easily one of the better movies thats Hollywood has turned out this year . See this . ( just take it on its own terms )
428788	3079504	342172	9.0	Pro or Con : A brilliant look at a family imploding	Knowing some of the parties involved in the actual case I was curious to see the film to see how they came across on the big screen . I was however reluctant to see it since the furor over who did what or who didn't or who's lying or not was clouding my perception of the film from the get go . I let time pass and finally sat down to watch the film once I thought things had calmed down . As a document of a family on the path to destruction I am floored by the film . This is a heart breaking exploration of how things are not what we think they are and how character flaws can and will wipe out the ones we love . ( Although I think Character flaws is the wrong term ) A great deal of the later half of the film dances around whether Jesse , the son who pleaded guilty to the charges , was really guilty . Its here I found the film to be slightly flawed because to me the film wants to have it both ways , him guilty and innocent . I think the film makers should have picked aside , since what they have done here seems less than subjective and fair ( to either side ) This is a tough film . If you can't handle frank sexual talk about child molestation then stay away . However , if you want to see an excellent film about a family in crisis then see this film . .
427876	3079504	446750	9.0	One of Greenaways best films	Peter Greenaway's story about Rembrandt and the painting of The Nightwatch . As a huge Greenaway fan I've been disappointed by most of Greenaways films over the last few years . Pillow Book , 8and a Half Women disappointed me . The Tulse Luper films are much better but too cerebral to fully connect to . In all honesty this is the most alive film and most " emotional " film Greenaway has made in 20 years , since Drowning by numbers . ( Greenaway makes films that are intentionally not going to make you feel , he wants to make you think ) . This is thanks to two things , first Greenaways best writing of his career . Here is a film where people interact like real people . They talk like real people , even when they break the fourth wall , they are living breathing characters . The other reason this works is because Martin Freeman ( Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead ) is so good that he takes Greenaways lines and makes them real . he is of course aided and abetted by the rest of the cast , but ultimately this is a film about Freeman and he makes the most of it . I really liked this film . I put the import DVD in to check to see how it loaded up ( the menus and such are in Russian ) and before I knew what was happening I was 45 minutes into the film . The film is so easy to fall into , it unlike almost anything Greenaway has done before . Its also very complex and it was clear that I was missing things . Greenaway has managed to pack the film with ideas and details many of which you can't catch on the first go through , several times I realized I missed a reference or a line earlier on . . . a second viewing is probably a must . If you like Greenaway's films its a must see . Its also worth seeing if you like beautiful ( it all looks like paintings ) and complex films . One of the best of Greenaway's films .
428391	3079504	140384	9.0	Interesting meditation of art , pleasure and life	I had been haunted by an image in Phil Hardy's Overlook Encyclopedia of Horror of the two leads in orgasmic contact . The description of the film made me wonder what sort of sick twisted film this was . Twenty years later the film came out on DVD and I picked up a copy . The plot , such as it is , concerns a blind man who kidnaps a model and holds her against her will . What happens next would be telling , as the three characters , the blind man's mother is his accomplice , interact in ways that are both surreal and primal . Even if you know what happens , you still can't be prepared for what happens . This is NOT for every taste . The psycho-sexual twists and turns may be not some peoples cup of tea . Even the blood , which by todays standards isn't much , kicks you in the head . No , its no perfect . The film is a bit too long , but its a trip and a half for those willing to take it on its terms . Recommended
428231	3079504	109433	9.0	Must see documentary about the martial arts genre	This is an over view of martial arts film history . It takes us from 1940's to the 1990's when the film was made . It has clips from all periods as well as interviews with many of the actors and directors that have worked in the genre . It is quite simply a must see for anyone who is interested in the genre or the history of film . Certainly its far from complete , the director did not interview everyone ( Jackie Chan is not interviewed but is seen in a good deal of footage ) and the film's use of clips is limited to what we'd now consider bargain basement films ( early Jackie Chan , anything in public domain , no major films like those of Bruce Lee , and though there are interviews with Steve James and Menahem Golan there is no footage from any of the Canon ninja films ) . Minor flaws aside , you will not do better than this film for an over view of the history of martial arts films . I have yet to run across a film that so neatly wraps everything up . ( IFC recently did a one hour program called Cinema Hong Kong : Kung Fu which is very good , and brings everything up to date but is much too short - Ideally that film and this would probably tell you everything you need or want to know about the genre ) . This is the real deal . ( Do keep in mind that things have changed since this film was made in particular with the collapse of the Hong Kong film industry , which is touted here as massive an thriving )
427298	3079504	420238	9.0	Wonderful film is more like reading a really good meaty book that you want to curl up with and lose yourself in	Okay we applauded at the end and I got teary at times . I have no idea when I last saw an animated film this complex made in the US . I mean that in a good way . I also have to wonder when was the last time I saw a real meaty fairy tale on screen , Strings perhaps ( oh what a great double feature that will be ) How the heck do I explain this simply ? I have no idea . Perhaps by saying this is the story of a mouse named Despereaux who isn't afraid of anything , who reads the stories of a knights and chivalry and takes an oath to be a gentlemen , who helps a princess trapped in a castle and a kingdom caught in gloom . One of the most beautiful animated films , possibly the best looking computer animated film yet with a lush scheme that makes it look like various paintings by people like Vermeer . At other times this is the equivalent of book illustrations come to life . As good as the trailers look the film itself is even better . If you love art ( both fine and animated , see this film since the film references numerous works . For the most part this is a beautifully adapted film that is like curling up with a good book . Where recent films like City of Ember or Twilight or even the Harry Potter films have links to their source novels that make them less then stand alone movies , this film takes the book and puts it on the screen and doesn't dumb it down or make it so you need to have read the book . You have real fleshed out characters of surprising complexity ( What is a character like Dustin Hoffman's doing in a film that is " for children ? " I don't care frankly because its wonderful ) . These are not one note sketches but living breathing people . It doesn't rush things , this is a film that takes its time telling the story and requires you actually pay attention . Despereaux doesn't show up for at least fifteen minutes as we get a long run up of why things are the way they are . Its wonderful since it beautifully lays out the world we are walking through . Its a real fairy tale movie that is much more complex than anything that Disney has been churning out , or even Pixar with the film juggling several story lines - Despereaux , Roscuro ( Hoffman ) , the maid , the Princess - all at the same time all seeming to get an equal amount of weight to their telling . It wonderful . Unfortunately the film has one flaw that keeps it from being perfect . ( This is a POTENTIAL SPOILER so you may not want to read this bit ) There is a moment or two after the meeting of Roscuro and the Princess when the climax of the film is set in motion when it felt like something was left out . How does all of the villainy transpire ? Its not fully clear and on some level I couldn't completely go with it to the next level . Its like coming to a canyon and you have to bridge it , but you suddenly find yourself on the other side without knowing how you got there . its the sort of thing that made the almost film closer to . ( END OF SPOILER ) Yes I really liked it . Yes I think you should see it , especially if you like really good fairy tales or stories that are not simple or simplistic . Its a wonderful movie .
428251	3079504	268536	10.0	Not Potted Plants	One would think that three people sitting in urns , not moving , telling the same story twice would be dull and boring , but its not . Using cross cutting and cinema tricks to make what on stage is a very static , very dull and over rated piece of twaddle , Anthony Minghella had fashioned an interesting and quite stimulating piece of film . What the point of it all is or is not I will leave up to the viewer . The real achievement of this film is how it makes essentially a play where nothing physically happens into a movie with motion and movement and excitement ( of a sort ) . Film students would be hard pressed to find a better example of what it means for the cinema to be in motion .
427217	3079504	311429	10.0	No , its not the Comic	Most people were upset that this film did not live up to the reputation for Moore and O'Neill's very over rated first comic book series , which is sad since taken on its own its a good little action film . The story in which a bunch of great literary characters are brought together to defeat a literary bad guy is excitingly told . Granted the visual effects are at times lacking but its the adventure that drives the beast and here its top notch even if its predictable ( How could it NOT be ? ) The cast is fantastic with not a bad one in the bunch , its impossible to tell the set was filled with strife since they appear to be having such a wonderful time . Turn your mind off and drop any expectations and simply see this film . Its the type of movie they don't make any more , not that I'm sure they ever did .
426990	3079504	114308	10.0	One of the Best Mickey Shorts Ever	As the second Mickey in Color DVD collection shows , after the release of the Brave Little Tailor Mickey's screen career was on a steady slide into the toilet . Outside of his feature appearances Mickey's films were dull . It wasn't until the 1980's with Mickey's Christmas Carol and The Prince and the Pauper that the animators knew what to do with the Disney symbol . In 1995 they released this gem and it simply is one of the best Disney shorts ever produced . Mickey in need of money to buy a gift for Minnie gets mixed up with a mad scientist and mayhem that previously was only witnessed in Warner cartoons occurs . Its every horror movie cliche turned on its head . What can I say ? This is funny funny stuff , that Disney , attached to some live action box office dog , so odds are you've never seen it , which is a shame because its so good that it almost single handedly makes the Price of the Mickey Mouse in Color Volume Two DVD set worth buying . Go track it down . Its only seven minutes long so you'll be able to watch it three or four times in a row with out feeling like you've wasted too much time . This is a true Disney classic .
