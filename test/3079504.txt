428419	3079504	308208	1.0	Can't we go into negative ratings ?	I liked the trailers , I hoped for the best and then sat in dumbstruck horror as one of the worst films ever made ( as in so bad its painful to watch bad ) unspooled before my eyes . Rumor has it that the film makers know a thing about movie making . I know the cast does , but what wanders across the screen looks like the dailies of a really bad TV commercial put together by someone with no sense of film structure . I'm told that this has something to do with two assassins fighting each other after some one is kidnapped , but I'm not certain since things just sort of happen for no real reason . I would like to think that this movie was a big joke on the movie going public but no one would want to spend what it cost to make this movie as a joke , especially when there was no hope of ever getting the money back in ten thousand life times . A void unless your eyes need to experience cinematic blunt force trauma applied to them .
428315	3079504	268295	1.0	Worst film by a director of any standing ever	This is nothing more than a cheap ass home movie done by a director who should have known better . Its not that there is anything wrong with this being made but the look and feel of it is that of a goof made among friends over a weekend for their own amusement . Regrettably someone though the rest of the world would find it equally enjoyable and released it on an unsuspecting world . The plot has Roderick Usher ending up in a asylum for murder where goth and allegedly racy things are going on . There music and jokes and tasteless stuff . Mostly there is an undying urge to turn the DVD off and put on one of Ken Russell's other films . . . anyone of them . I'm a Ken Russell fan . I've always liked that fact that no matter what he did there was always something interesting to look at or see somewhere in the movie . Here there is nothing . Its a complete waste of time . Oh how one of the cinema's great directors has fallen . . . .
428783	3079504	338763	1.0	Avoid at All Costs	Three years after the events in the first film the Japanese government sends a class of kids out to kill the survivors of the last game who have now become terrorists . Everything I've read on this movie says that people either really love this or really hate it . Personally , I don't think one can hate this film enough . This film is a almost a complete mess . Yes the battle scenes are well done in a Spielbergian sort of way , but the rest of the film makes no real sense . I would like to say that the director took the vision for the film to his grave , except that his son , who wrote the script finished it for him . Would someone explain something for me , why does the daughter of the character played by Takeshi Kitano in the first film , and who chose to join the war , think that running around killing kids will make her understand why her father failed to love her ? It makes no sense . Neither does much of what goes on . This film demands to be intentionally and forcefully ignored . Frankly any attention paid to it , including burning the negative , cutting every frame to pieces is merely allowing it to think it has a right to exist . because you can't go negative .
428731	3079504	366282	1.0	Surely on the list of all time bad bad ( unfun ) movies	This is the brief story of a bunch of male space explorers looking for women to impregnate before they are no longer able to have children . Somehow they end up on a planet where they are captured and chatter as women in latex clothing fight each other and roll around on the floor to really bad music . I can't say more than that because there really isn't much more to it than that . ( There may have been but I stopped caring ) Can we say cheap ? Can we say shot on video badness ? Can we please have an Ed Wood film , or better yet Orgy of the Dead where the women were at least topless ? Could we please have anything perhaps even a large rusted needle to poke out my eyes ? This set bound disaster is billed as being in the style of Barbarella . Say what you will that had a plot , and acting , and something approaching other than a bad TV talk show style set . This is awful . Should you be stupid enough to actually watch this you may want to be warned of the use of about ten or fifteen seconds of hardcore sex appearing during the solarized entrance from the desert to the blue bubble . Its off to one side of the screen and would not be really noticeable except the video effect only partially obscures it and so its the only thing you can really see . I had to go back to see what it was since it seemed out of place . Its not a reason to pick this up , but parents who intend to destroy their children's minds by showing this film to them may be offended , I was bored . Simply one of the worst piles of dog waste ever made .
429097	3079504	1142800	1.0	The worst Tyler Perry film . See the play instead	I'm a Tyler Perry fan . Even when I don't like one of his films I find some spark that makes me certain he's bound for an Oscar . Unfortunately this is the first time I've felt that he's missed the boat and maybe heading for a crash . The plot has an assistant district attorney helping an old friend , now a hooker , in trying to come clean and start over while his fianc√© , the DA tries to make sure that never happens . Meanwhile Madea's antics have finally landed her in prison where Madea continues her ways unabated . I like Madea and have always found Perry's portrayal hysterical , but here Perry is awful and is way way way over the top , even when compared to the stage shows . It shows signs of Perry being distracted ( with three movies a year and two TV shows how could he not ) and there is a sense that he was just trying to get to the next thing . He and the some of the cast march through the proceedings as if they were Sherman marching to the sea . Perry's Madea isn't a character rather its a man in a dress saying lines ( Its clear Perry really does want to kill Madea off if he gets the chance ) . It all makes for the worst Tyler Perry film and the first one I can't recommend on any level . Actually cut your losses and get the video of the stage show . instead , That was damn funny and touching . Seriously this is the one Tyler Perry film that just doesn't work .
428627	3079504	29207	1.0	One of the worst mysteries ever put on film	Eddie Quillan gives one of his worst performances as Ellery Queen . The plot involves the theft of a rare stamp and the murders that occur in its wake . Quillan , as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat . The mystery itself is fine . I can even live with the cheapness of the production ( nothing looks real ) . What I can't stand are the performances , no one in this cast with the exception of Frank Pangborn gives anything remotely like a performance . Can't anyone on screen act ? I guess not . The worst offender is Quillan who turns Ellery Queen into an insufferable twit . I wanted to smack him . Charming or disarming he's not . He ruins what could have been an okay bad movie . I hate this movie , I hate it a great deal .
428668	3079504	990376	2.0	A waste of time	released with no publicity or anything a few weeks back I saw this on a couple of movie Marquees and went to investigate . Family friendly ( they hoped ) TV movie about a 17 or 18 year old girl going to visit the family of a deceased childhood friend . There she runs into a mystery involving ghosts and a death curse . My notes from this are sketchy , mostly scribbles about how Rissa Walters as Sarah can't act . To be certain she looks good but its all over once she opens her mouth . The real question I seemed to have was how this ever got any sort of theatrical release , even one that rivals the release of Terry Jones Wind and the Willows ( Then again this has some promotional material , I remember a poster , wind in the willows didn't ) . A waste of time . Lets hope the promise of a series of Sarah Landon films never is fulfilled .
428163	3079504	316732	3.0	Weak remake of 3 classics	This is the American version of the French Taxi films and it suffers in comparison . I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film , it lifts sequences from the second and third films . Its a mess , a real mess . I'm a huge huge fan of the French films , and for me there was no real point in my seeing this since anything that worked came from the originals . Why did they bother ? They changed the sex of the lead ( though the Queen is excellent ) , combined others and rewrote the cops mother to the point of stupidness . They lost any sense of timing and connection . . . they should have started from the ground up . Its not the painfully awful film that some reviews made it out to be , but it is a waste of time . If you can find the originals and watch those . That should take you the better part of 5 hours and in the end you will not feel as though you've wasted your life . .
427270	3079504	1014775	3.0	Great if you're five years old	Spoiled rich dog ends up dog napped south of the border as various celebrities provide the voices . Oh so cutesy film is better than the reviews made out , but nowhere near as good as the show stopping trailer promised ( The big musical production number trailer that preceded the films release made me very excited at the prospect of seeing the finished film ) . If I was five I probably would have loved it , but being the old guy that I am I found it passable and a reason to be thankful I don't have kids of a certain age who would play this ad nauseum . Given the option I would take a pass , something that anyone with little kids will not be able to do .
426785	3079504	397044	3.0	After gutting the source novel the movie turns out to be just another TV movie of the week	Who did they make this film for ? The story of a romance between a werewolf and a human , in its prototypical story of mismatched cultures , is the sort of thing thats been done to death in countless films and books . If you're going to do it yet again you have to have some reason . I'm sure that using the source of a well loved , and occasionally banned young adult novel would be the perfect reason to trot out the story line yet again . Unfortunately the film makers have botched the job and we're left with a barely okay little movie . Why use a well known story if you're going to change things around ? great chunks of the book have gone missing . Worse still is the way the film has been shot . It looks more like a TV movie of the week rather than a movie to be seen in the theater , if they were going to make a movie that looks like it belongs on TV why not just release it straight to DVD ? The acting is okay but the characters are all stereotypes of stereotypes . You know whats going to happen simply because it seems to have been written that way . Its not engaging or surprising simply because once a scene starts you can tell how its going to play out , actually once the movie's basic premise is set up you'll know whats going to happen , regrettably you won't care . Not worth bothering with unless you need a lesson in how not to adapt a book for the movies .
427984	3079504	447619	3.0	Boring .	Monica Bellucci adopts a young Asian child . Years later Bellucci begins having nightmares and someone or something seems to be interested in her son , who it appears has a great hidden power . I love the idea of Bellucci and Catherine Deneuve in a movie together . I only wish the pairing wasn't in a movie as dull as this . Its a been there and done that film ( I mean how many films are there where the adoptive parents didn't know their kid was special ? ) that has nothing new to offer . Its such an " exciting " film and I was so " intrigued " by what was happening that I didn't bother to finish the film when the DVD I wigged out and wouldn't play , I simply put it into the returns slot and let someone else deal with it . I'm guessing that thats whats been happening all along with that particular copy of the DVD . Don't run the risk of getting the bad DVD thats floating around , don't see this film . A snoozer .
428118	3079504	55590	3.0	Good Looking Dud	Good looking spectacle with a cast of tens . You can see that actors are playing both sides in what amounts to a Euro-western set in the ancient world . Its Etruscans vs Romans with the woman taken hostage after they dressed as Roman soldiers after their side lost . The dialog is stupid and the romances wobble any hope of a decent story . Its the kind of film that almost seems good but isn't so seems much worse as a result . I've seen it twice by accident and I hope never to see it again .
428844	3079504	144018	3.0	Mediocre film of a mediocre play	After a war on a far off Island is won women are recruited to come be with the soldiers and help set up a new colony . Of course things don't go right . Based on a play by Jeff Noon , best known for the Vurt novels , this is a mediocre film based on a mediocre play . I'm a huge fan of Jeff Noon's writing but I really don't like the play since it feels much too obvious for what it is . You can feel the film's heart on its sleeve as it criticizes the Falkland's war , the military and male female relationships in a macho environment . It's all much too obvious . I would take a pass if you come across it unless your a fan of the cast which includes Guy Pearce , Ray Winstone and Emily Lloyd .
429126	3079504	448157	3.0	Major misfire with too much going on . Only comes alive in sporadic moments	Major misfire from Will Smith concerning a superhero with a drinking problem who decides to redo his image of destruction . Based on what many have considered a great script " Tonight He Comes " ( which I haven't read but which I've read about ) this is a movie with some really good ideas , which after bobbling them for an hour drops them as they add another 15 to the mix . The idea is that its lonely being a superhero and that one would eventually begin to drink because one was all alone . Drink causes problems as does anger problems - usually resulting in millions of dollars in insurance claims . The idea is rather clever and its one thats been used before in better films like Superguy : Behind the Cape a pseudo-documentary about the problems of being a superhero . Its a good idea as I said and there are moments here where they pull it off but its only in the odd moment and every now and again . ( even if there are tons of unanswered logic problems ) Which is fine for the first hour where the jokes and the effort to put something together comes across as an okay time filler ( which I hated to spend money on-at its best this is a cable flick ) . The trouble is that about an hour into the movie it begins to add in plot points that come out of left field . First there is a twist that plays out badly over the next half hour then a major plot development occurs that drives the film to its conclusion . In that last half hour enough plot for at least another 90 minutes is set up and the rushed through . Of course the twists are so WTF that with in the context of the film that as it stands now that the film completely falls on its face . I kept wanting to reach for the remote to jump to the end ( curse the movie theater experience ) . There is a good story in there somewhere but someone-probably several someones - botched the film . ( I read there were lots of rewrites and passes through the editing suites ) A perfect example of how not to make a movie by committee ( and will probably be on my worst of the year list for that reason ) . a final ( despite some early moments and great lines ) This kind of skirts the PG13 and R border . I thought it was R until I saw other wise . Frankly its probably more R then PG13 thanks to language and violence
428481	3079504	26360	4.0	Story meanders too much and the leads are unlikable to be much of anything	Young woman plays a game of chicken with a young man speeding down the road unaware that he is racing to a fire . She cuts him off and he crashes into a light post . He takes her car and continues on his way . It's a meet cute that leads into a story of the pair and how it connects to arson and insurance fraud . It's a good looking film with a real sense of place thanks to it not being sound stage bound ( The fire department scenes are neat ) . The problem for me was that the film seems to meander all around being more about the semi idle rich then about crime . Whats worse is the characters are more annoying rather than endearing . I lost patience with the film about a third of the way through and began to do other things until the last ten minutes when boy and girl race off to prevent a fire at warehouse that was being intentionally set . All the excitement at the very end-its great but there's a slog to get there . Its not a bad , though its probably just okay at best , movie but it was probably the wrong movie for my mood last night .
427847	3079504	493402	4.0	Director Olivier Assayas constructs a complicated tale that leaves his actors completely adrift	Olivier Assayas ' film stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen . Madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble . In desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle , a company from the Far East . As Madsen begins his moves away from his company Asia Argento returns to his life . The pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen ( with said Golden Eagle ) . Once Argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control . I'm not a fan . Actually I was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which I kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for Argento . Argento , daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right , is a unique actress . At times stunningly good , she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . I don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too " complicated " to support it . I didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way ( she seemed more nut job than anything else ) . I'm not blaming the actors but writer / director Assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle , but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work . If you must try it on cable
428643	3079504	156610	4.0	Slow doesn't begin to tell it	This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and . . . I stopped caring . This is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex . There's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment . Also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports . . . Sounds promising ? Not really . I became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film . Basically I started not watching , which made events seem even more surreal when I did look up . It may work for you , it didn't for me .
428686	3079504	1204883	4.0	Bland dull and completely not needed	Supernatural weirdness on a college campus as a girl sees her room mate commit suicide and there after begins to see the boogeyman doing in her classmates everywhere . This is a bland direct to DVD sequel that isn't as horrible as you might think , but was obviously made for money not love . Its too mechanical to be scary with the film's choice of shots being weak , especially since many shots and sequences go on to long . Its almost good , but not quite . Pretty much unnecessary since its nether good enough to worth watching nor bad enough to use as a target for pithy remarks . somewhere around
429072	3079504	378394	4.0	Paul Naschy fans only need apply	Spanish alien zombie comedy gore film isn't very good . Two men escape from prison then make a b-line to retrieve some stolen cash . Ending up double crossed they find themselves up against some alien zombies . Starring Paul Naschy , famous for playing werewolf in a long running series of movies , this is an on the cheap production that reminded me of Peter Jackson's Bad Taste . Very gory , the film is hampered by some really bad taste and offensive attitudes ( misogyny abounds ) , its just not fun to listen to these jerks . Worse is the fact that humor more often than not falls flat . Only Naschy gives any reason to see the film .
427721	3079504	408790	4.0	Annoying performances and unbelievable plot make this tough viewing	Th plot is simple . During a night time flight Jody Foster's daughter disappears . No one believes her . And it becomes a race to find her missing daughter before they land . This is an unbelievable variation of a locked room mystery . Locked room mysteries are the type of stories where someone is " murdered " in a locked room that no one can get into , nor could they have gotten out with out leaving some sign . When they are done well , say in the Kennel Murder Case , you truly have no idea whats going on and you believe a miracle has taken place . When its done badly you end up with a movie like this . The problem here is that the movie is unbelievable and contrived from the start . The problem for me was that for this to work you have to get over the fact that no one saw her daughter . . . or her disappear . . . nor is there a good reason for the events to transpire . It's so contrived , it never worked for me . The plot just made no reasonable sense at any point ( I'm not discussing the problems because there isn't enough space nor do I want to give too much away if you do want to see it ) . I know several people who loved this movie and while they admitted after the fact that there are plot holes ( chasms is a better word ) , they didn't notice it while the movie was running because they were so caught up in it . I didn't believe a moment of it from the start , worse the film spins out in such away that it gives you time to think about how things don't fit together . To top it all off Jody Foster's character and performance are completely unlikable from the start . Allowing for the fact that she is suppose to be stressed , taking the body of her husband home , she still starts the movie two steps away from shrill only to cross the line almost instantly . If I were the crew I wouldn't have listened to her either . This is the worst performance I've ever seen Foster give . Illogical and shrill . If you must see this wait for home video or cable .
428633	3079504	940709	4.0	Cruel and nasty " kids " film may induce nightmare	Stephen ( Shoalin Soccer , Kung Fu Hustle ) Chow's cruel edged children's film . Stephen Chow is a coolie who works on construction jobs to puts his son into a posh school in order to give him opportunities . Chow's son is still despised because they are so poor they have to make due with thrown away things like sneakers and dirty clothes . One day while out trying to scavenge a pair of sneakers Chow stumbles upon what he thinks is a bouncy ball but which is really an alien that looks like a chia pet crossed with day glow slime . The alien is named CJ7 and he complicates everyones lives-though not in the way you think . Stephen Chow's films often have a cruel edge , however there tends to be a cartoony nature to the story that softens it . The edge is in full force as Chow torments his lead characters as they endure the brick bats of the haves and of life . The abuse is not only verbal but decidedly physical as the boy is beaten up by bullies and has to suffer other indignities . Let me put it this way Chow even has his son's character covered in poop . Yea the poop joke is funny at first but Chow pushes it too far and it just becomes uncomfortable , which is how many of the jokes end . I think humor works better if the characters deserve to be abused , these characters don't . What did Chow and his son do to deserve the abuse ? nothing but be too poor for words . ( And even in the end what ever they overcome and win is not matched by what they had to get there , its ugly ) Its as if all Chow knew was cruelty jokes and he started there and let everything else slip away . I'm all for not coddling kids with " safe " jokes , but there is a nastiness here that I wouldn't want my kids to see . . . . . . actually I don't think anyone should see it , not just because it ugly , but because this movie isn't very good . The jokes and the gags more often then not fall flat . ( most of ) The punchlines are obvious and the jokes are often tired ( kids special pet gives him super abilities is tired , even if there is a twist ) . The direction seems weak and where there was a snap to Chow's earlier film things are just too flaccid . Perhaps the cast of kids wasn't up to it , or perhaps director / writer Chow wasn't sure what he was doing . To be certain the adults in the story are almost nonentities , which is odd since you would have thought that Chow the writer director would have given himself some sort of a character to play , he's just a stoic dad trying to do what he can for his kid . There is nothing . To be honest Chow has badly constructed a plot which doesn't flow , it lurches from thing to thing . Its as if he had a series of set pieces but nothing but thin threads to connect them . There are a few things that work mostly to do with CJ7 . There are several times when the little special effect steals the show like when it shows the emotions the various kids shout out ( You're family is killed , you get 100 on a test ) or how it rolls down a car window , when it constructs super items . Its pure silliness . And as much as I'm bitching I also like that Chow doesn't play down to the kids and sweeten the lives of our main characters , but I just wish he didn't make its so cruel and bleak , I mean there is a moment when things seem to turn around for our leads when something truly nasty happens . Its all " okay " in the end , but even that has a price ( not to mention it will probably instill nightmares in many children ) . Its not a horrible movie , but its close to a horrifying one , especially if you want to protect you kids from unpleasantness . I'd rather show my kids Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle . I could be over reacting and the film just sort of caught me in an odd way , but I suggest to watch this alone before you let your kids see it . Though if I was given a choice I'd watch Disney's Secret of the Magic Gord - which is similar to this film and deserving of a release outside of Asia .
427829	3079504	43080	4.0	Not particularly much of anything	American sailor has his ship attacked by pirates and ends up ashore in Australia where he falls in love with one of the local women . When the pirates attack the village the sailor has to go off to rescue his lady love . . . only to end up shipwrecked on an island with dinosaurs . Misbegotten adventure film that stands out only because of the dinosaurs in the final minutes , this is a clunky adventure film that isn't very good . One person here on IMDb indicates that this is actually several episodes of an an sold TV show stitched together , which makes perfect sense owing to the compartmentalized structure of the films stories . Not really bad , it is like watching an old TV show that you never heard of for a good reason . I picked up the film because of the dinosaurs on the cover only to later read about how they only show up at the end , and then was shocked at how little even that was . My dislike for the film has nothing to do with the lack of monsters , indeed I was ready to bail on the film early on , but kept going because I wanted to see said beasties . Not worth your time , let alone your money
426960	3079504	67135	4.0	Well made revenge tale is severely hobbled in its short version by the loss of everything but the gun fights	A man returns home from the Civil War to find his wife and child have been murdered . He vows revenge and sets off to get it . Before he kills he sets in motion a small mechanical drummer that was one of his son's toys . As the body count increases the town where the killers reside gets nervous wondering who is next . I saw the shorter 75 minute version of this film and can only wonder how this plays in the full 99 minute Italian version . Here the film is a series of brutal gun downs by our " hero " with very little in between them . To be honest the action is not bad , its just that with little more than the gunfights for the first half of the movie any interest is lost before the second half gets under way ( I ended up picking up the paper and reading ) . There is no character development and little plot beyond the quest for revenge and the sheriff trying to stop him by standing around looking concerned . Making things worse is the dubbing which is so loopy as to be nonsensical . This is not a movie I can not recommend , at least in the shorter version , unless you are need to be put to sleep or are trying to see every Spaghetti Western ever made .
428439	3079504	253474	4.0	Over-rated story of survival	I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me . Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him , but I never really connected to the story . I never really cared . I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that . Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play , in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal . I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter . Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care . Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him . I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable , which means this movie meant nothing to me . This film is a major disappointment
427653	3079504	395585	4.0	Foirgettable	big brother meets survivor as nine people are locked in a house and told only one will live to collect the five million dollar prize . This is a been there and done that in the extreme , with riffs from other better movies stolen . Whats worse then the fact that the film is so derivative is the fact that it changes the rules a couple of times . I hate when films do that since its a clear sign that the filmmakers were not clever enough to work out a clear plot . Clkealry they didn't trust themselves to come up with a fair way to the end . Flaws aside this is still watchable in an undemanding mood-though it is quite forgettable which is good since its not something you'll recommend
428033	3079504	330842	4.0	Poor shot on video horror film	Shot on video tale of a member of a film crew taking a haunted object home from a shoot and having her life turned upside down . Poorly acted and adequately shot this is an on the cheap straight to video from Hong Kong thats like many films like this a bit too knowing for its own good . Certainly its not quite like a Troma film , but there is a sense of make believe that permeates these films that prevent you from ever believing a frame of it . . . . ( which is sad since the first film in the series is very good ) This is one of a growing number of shot on video cheapies that seem to flooding the Asian horror market ( and even the direct to video markets else where in the world ) . While I admire that we are getting some good films , I hate that we are getting too many films like this which are being made with little care and purely to make a buck , there by undercutting a decent cast trying to actually give performances .
428622	3079504	70654	5.0	Bad movie lovers rejoice , you've found another lost treasure	A young boy runs his dad over with a bulldozer , which then manages to run over his arm . The kid then goes off to the mental hospital for many years . When he gets out he find his mother has remarried and he kills his step dad . When mom objects he kills her too before heading off on the road to continue his murder spree while being haunted by his mother's face . ( that , my friends is the first fifteen minutes or so . It gets weirder from there ) This movie is laughably bad . Its one of those movies you keep bursting out in uncontrolled laughter during because you can't believe what you are seeing . The film looks like a standard drive-in film from the time it was made with some good effects thrown in . The problem is the script and the acting are so loopy that its impossible to be frightened by anything going on . How did our " hero " ever get out with out killing everyone with in 500 miles ? Why aren't the cops all over his behind from the get go ? How did people feel when they paid good money to see this ? Get your friends . Get some drinks . Get some popcorn . Get a copy of this movie and have a party riffing on its jaw dropping badness . Its a lost treasure of bad movie-dom .
428912	3079504	1114677	5.0	Better than it should be , its still full of plastic rich people trying to be humble	Prepackaged and completely fake big screen version of the hit TV series is a good film if you like the series or can stomach the plastic fakeness of it all . I mean that both as a slap and as praise since the film is much better than I thought it would be but at the same time I can't believe how incredibly fake it all was ( kids actually buy into this ? ) . To be fair I have to say that I didn't make it to the end , I ended up moving on to 17 Again after about half this films running time simply because my brain was full and my ability to deal with a bunch of insincere rich people trying to get in touch with what matters struck me as a hollow effort even if its well done . If you're a fan of the show give it a shot , otherwise you're on your own depending upon your tolerance for entertainment brought to you by the Stepford Wives .
427010	3079504	810880	5.0	Its all there except the script	Giancarlo Esposito directs and co stars in the story of a town with racial strife in its past thanks to the killing of a civil rights leader decades before . As the ghosts of the past are woken up and a new corporate threat comes to town the people in the town are forced to make some choices . Well made and well acted tale wants to hit one out of the box in examinations of race and community , but is mired with a script that never completely shakes off its well worn cloak . We've been here before and while much of the film works , it still relies on clich√© ( there is something about Julia Stiles character that just doesn't ring true ) . I think perhaps the film is trying to do too much , there are a good number of characters and all are given a certain amount of time . I liked it , but I didn't love it . Of course the DVD cover made it look like a thriller or mystery , which while it has elements isn't what it really is .
428591	3079504	22358	5.0	If you can get past the annoying Zasu Pitts this is an okay mystery with a neat solution	Rich slimeball Folsom refuses to marry his mistress because he is married . He refuses to divorce his wife because that would mean he had to marry his mistress . Not long after a complicated confrontation in his apartment with the wife , the bodyguard and the mistress ( who I think kills herself ) Folsom is killed . It then becomes a question of who did it and why . Creaky murder mystery is okay once it gets going . Its a typical talky early sound mystery that seems a bit too ripe for its own good . Really working against the film is Zasu Pitts as a phone operator in the building where the action takes place . She is a shrill Greek chorus of sorts commenting on the events . If you can get past the shrillness the mystery is good with its solution worth taking the hour to watch this . To be honest I wasn't loving it , more liking it , until I got to the end at which point I was like , " Oh that was cool " . Its something you'll watch once , but worth the look if you get past the Pitts .
428642	3079504	113492	5.0	Over produced	This comic adaption has some great things in it . Max von Sydow for example , some of the photography in some sequences , but it has too much wrong with it to be anything other than okay . Stallone of over the top , Rob Schneider is too silly , a misreading of the characters and a bloatedness that only too much money can buy . The problems with the movie are best summed up by the main street set which is huge . It looks great , it looks wonderful . It is shown repeatedly from only one angle . You never really move off this one street , and you never change perspective , it always the same shots from the same angles probably because they couldn't shoot it any other way . Its not as bad as you've heard , but its not good . My suggestion is a big tub of popcorn , some friends in a bitchy mood and this movie for a fine roast fest of Hollywood excess .
429076	3079504	454921	5.0	By the numbers feel good movie is a bit too by the numbers	Well made , well intentioned movie about a man who gets custody of his son as his life implodes and he takes an unpaid internship in the hope that it leads to something greater . So sweet it hurts . So manipulative you get whip lash . So obvious you wonder why you're watching . Its a good movie but I felt manipulated . This is the uplifting tale of a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps to become a success , and it hits all the numbers in a way that seems more like a self empowerment seminar rather than a real movie . Whether this has to do with the fact that the real life counterpart of Will Smith's character does just that I don't know , but it doesn't make for completely gripping viewing since odds are you know how its going to come out . I don't hate the movie , its not bad , but jeeze give me a chance to connect on my own with out flipping the clich√© switches ( how many clich√©s can a real life story have ? . )
428631	3079504	71535	5.0	Its just sort of there	Legend says a Lorelei lives in a cave near a river . Every full moon she takes the shape of a monster and comes out to kill , removing the hearts from her victims . Fearing her girls might be next a schoolmaster hires a hunter to keep her girls safe . Rubber suited monster movie from the director of the Blind Dead films . Enjoyment of this film will depend on your tolerance for monster that is clearly a rubber suit under a hooded cloak , and your mood . I normally would eat this sort of nonsense up , but for whatever reason I came into the film all wrong . Don't get me wrong its a well made film as these Euro-horrors go , but its so run of the mill and connect the dot plot-wise that you're going to be disappointed . Some people have claimed that this is a lost classic , but I don't think so . Certainly its better than a good number of similar horror films since it has a decent cast , good special effects ( though silly monster ) and some well filmed sequences , but at the same time the by the numbers nature of the plot collapses the whole thing in on itself since its all too clear from the start where its going . I've seen better and worse , and this is one I wish was better . Forgive me for not saying more but the film just doesn't elicit a better response , it's just sort of there . ( I really should point out that I will be visiting this film again when the right mood strikes me )
426931	3079504	882978	5.0	Epic story is reduced to showing big battles and simply using dialog to link them	Andy Lau stars as a general who started as a foot soldier and worked his way up through the ranks after several acts of heroism . Thirty years on he's forced to fight one last battle against the daughter of an old enemy . Apparently based on the same source material ( The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ) that John Woo is using for his 3 hour Red Cliffs ( due for release later this year ) Here the " epic " story is reduced to around 100 minutes of marching armies and battles . Any sense of plot is cast aside for the fighting and deep pronouncements . To be fair the DVD I watched had barely coherent subtitles , but at the same time they were coherent enough to know that they really didn't have a great deal to translate . The plot lurches from thing to thing with very little explanation - or rather only explanation to carry the emotion . We're told things rather than shown things . The performances of Lau and Sammo Hung provide a great deal of emotion that isn't in the script . The bond between the two men and the emotion that they impart are the reason you watch the film , not for anything else . . . . . . okay maybe the action . As a film of epic action scenes its quite good . its not great but it is is good in a retro old school style . Its pretty pictures of armies fighting and it is entertaining , if rarely engaging ( something the films scant dialog and character building prevents from ever happening ) . Never mind that coming as it does on the heels of the Jet Li masterpiece Warlords the film has a great deal to live up to since that earlier film had real characters and real action , two things this film never manages to achieve . Add to the mix the over use of slow motion and the film really isn't worth the trouble . Actually its worth looking at if you want to see the fighting and a couple of good performances .
427212	3079504	311618	5.0	A Beautiful Vanity Project	This is one of the best looking anime features I've run across . The animation is glorious , the design and the world created are rich in images and wonders to see . The trouble is that the movie is a snail paced retelling of Pinocchio that even at two hours and sixteen minutes doesn't tell the whole story , there are gaps between sequences that leave you puzzling how we got from A to B . The film is suppose to be a very personal project by the director who worked on it for ten years , but there is such a thing as being too close to a project and in this case he was much too close . I can see how the lack of complete explanation might appeal to some people but for me it was more bewildering than intriguing , the film didn't make a lot of sense and took forever not making it . ( Visuals are a , the rest is up to you , I give it a five over all simply because the visuals are so fantastic it makes watching it interesting at least for a majority of it )
427526	3079504	482930	5.0	Great action is the draw in an okay comic book adaptation	Comic book based martial arts film about two brothers who reunite and with the help of a friend battle evil in a city . Spectacular but over the top wire work sequences are the main draw in what is a purely by the book affair . Certainly for fans the action is all that is needed here but its comic book over the topness coupled with a wafer thin story line make it less than enthralling . I'm sure this would have played better had I read the comic , unfortunately I didn't so I felt more than just a little lost . Worth a look for action fans and martial arts mavens all others should decided based upon their mood .
428051	3079504	293508	5.0	Your mileage may vary	Its big . . . Its opulent . . . Its high camp . I found this version of the classic story of the Phantom of the Opera to be very silly . Big and beautiful and so over done that I came very close to laughing at it . Don't get me wrong its not bad , its just so over blown , over the top , over done that its very hard to take it seriously . Many people I know who saw it loved it , I just can't get past the silliness of it all . Should you see it ? Oh yes , simply because they don't make movies that look like this any more , if they ever really did . Will you like it ? Hey , thats up to you . If you hate the stage musical stay away . Beyond that you're on your own .
428877	3079504	469263	5.0	Quirky tale of a civilian astronaut is too quirky for its own good , but still delivers a few good moments .	Billy Bob Thorton is a once upon a time astronaut who had to leave the program to work on his family farm . Never having lost his desire to go into space he builds his own rocket , much to the dismay of the government . Off beat story is good but never quite pulls it together . Its a little too forcibly off beat signaled by the opening as Thorton rides around his farm on horseback in a space suit . Its almost like an annoying indie film that thinks being quirky means its a good film , with a bigger budget and bigger stars . Despite some great characters and some great exchanges ( I love Thorton dealing with the government people who want to shut him down ) this never adds up to the moon shot it was hoping for . this could have been something , but it just missed Worth a shot , but I'd wait for cable
427414	3079504	901476	5.0	For women only	Two women , friends since childhood and both wanting to be married at the Plaza , become enemies of a sort when both get engaged at the same time and angle for the same wedding at the same place . I'm clearly not the audience for this . I really can't say if its worth seeing as a result . I'm sure if I was a woman I probably would have liked this better , but I'm not so I didn't . I thought some of it was funny but I found it too artificial and superficial ( It didn't help I didn't like the women ) . If you're a woman I'd give it a shot . If you're not I'd probably give it a pass . ( And when did Kate Hudson start to look so old and artificial ? )
427312	3079504	285624	5.0	Well acted story done in by so so film making	I saw this as Vendetta and was very disappointed . Its not that the acting or the story was bad , its just that the direction and everything about the film on a technical level comes across as unimaginative bad TV . Basically its the story of an Irish family in Boston where some end up as good guys and some as bad . Daniel Baldwin stars as the head of the Irish Mafia who is running into trouble . I really can't say much about this movie . I wanted so much to like it but was forced to keep repeating " This should be better , this should be better " over and over to prevent my frustration from harming the TV . Its not quite that bad , and it is worth seeing on cable . I just wish it was better .
426932	3079504	889588	6.0	Good but not great story of a man saving children in time of war	Film version of the life of George Hogg . Hogg was a British national who went to China during the Rape of Nanking as a reporter and ended up taking care of a bunch of orphans in the face of Japanese barbarity on the Chinese people . The version I saw was dubbed completely in Chinese and had English subtitles . As it stands now its a good but rather standard film about a man who tried to do something in the face of war . The film stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Hogg . He's fine , but I don't think he's given much to do since much of the action seems to be reduced to clich√© , even the romance with the broken Australian nurse has the feeling of been there . Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yoeh have small but important roles ( respectively ) as a general who befriends Hogg and a black marketeer who helps him . I liked it but didn't love it ( its one of those films thats " almost . . " but isn't and falls between the cracks ) . Perhaps because of the possibly bad subtitles or more likely the clich√©d script the under appreciated Roger Spottiswoode used just isn't great . This isn't to say there aren't a couple of great set pieces , there are , the attack on the train in particular , but its not enough to raise the film from the near great to the great , or from nearly very good to very good . It just sort of misses . The just sort of misses feeling was re-enforced after I read some pieces on line which gives more details on the real George Hogg ( He needs a miniseries about his life not two hour film ) 6ish out of 10
428682	3079504	38974	6.0	Good but nothing special	In name only sequel to the film Sherlock Holmes movie Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman . The plot here has a young woman staying at a house with a strange woman named Zenobia ( played by Gale Sondergaard from the Holmes film ) as a house keeper / companion . Unknown to the young woman is the fact that Zenobia is draining her of some blood every night to feed to her plants . Standard but somewhat awkward thriller isn't bad , but isn't anything special . The film feels like a program horror film where they just sort of threw elements together and hoped that they stuck . Is it a horror film or a pseudo-Holmes film ? Its never really clear and the film suffers for it . The producers even went so far as to put another connection to the Holmes series by having Rondo Hatton as a mute Handyman , but he isn't given much to do other then look menacing . . Its good but nothing special .
427709	3079504	486028	6.0	Good but should have been better . I'm very ambivalent about it	Cops and an insurance investigator try to stop a serial bomber who torments with riddles and has now set his sight on a college student . Odd story with style that lacks and real characters you can care about . Its not a bad movie , far from it but this could have and should have been a great film , all that would have been required would be to give us real people to hang out with instead we get cyphers and cut outs . It keeps you watching but it never fully engages you . I highly doubt that you'll remember ever seeing it after the end credits roll . Worth a shot on cable .
428562	3079504	171824	6.0	Realistic account of the events in the big budget A Bridge Too Far is worth seeing simply because it shows the battle as it really was .	This is what we would now call a docudrama about the battle in and around Arnhem during the closing days of the Second World War . Mixing actual footage of the battle with new footage shot a year after the war in and around the ravaged city with many of the surviving soldiers playing themselves , this tells the same story that was told in the big Budget A Bridge Too Far . Its very much a you are there sort of film that pretty much seems to tell it like it was . I ran across this film in a budget collection of World War two films and since I'm a big fan of a Bridge Too Far I thought I'd pick it up . I'm not sure which is the better movie . One is a huge Hollywood financed production , the other is a small scale gritty in your face film that certainly shows what it must have been like . One I like because I like the story and the spectacle , the other I like because it shows what it was really like , and how Hollywood's version was too neat and clean . As good as this film is it has two problems in my eyes . First off its a bit disjointed . The film is telling the whole story about what happened in and around Arnhem and things get lost , " characters " blend into one another . Part of this seems to be the result of the fact that the film seems to have been dubbed after the fact and it seemed to me that several people have the same voice . Its not bad but I began to feel awash in the proceedings . The second problem with the film is that its awfully stereotypically " British " . Everyone is low key and even keeled . Everyone takes everything in stride , even the fact that they are surrounded with seemingly no way out . Its all greeted with a levelness that seems wildly out of the " ideal " notion of the British soldier rather than reality . The attitude is fine for a while , but buy the half way point into the film I was shaking my head and giggling at the calmness of it all . For me it severely detracted from the proceedings and left me feeling very disappointed . Flawed or not this is a must see , especially for those who like the later inflated epic film .
428856	3079504	819765	6.0	Well made decent into a violent world where there is no hope	A man raised in Cambodia to fight and die in gladiatorial like fights is brought to Hong Kong in order to kill someone . After the hit goes down he finds himself being chased by a police detective who is probably even more messed up than he is . As a technical achievement this film is a triumph . It looks great and has a style thats all it own . Its in your face style keeps you riveted and abused . In an almost real way you're there being beaten about . This is , in its way one of the best looking films to come out of Asia in 2006 . As an viewing experience this is a tough film to take . From the opening frames its clear that this is not going to be a happy story and its tale of revenge and escape becomes even harder to take . This is a bleak tale that has no hope anywhere in it . The action sequences are gritty and realistic with an edge that makes them more a slap in the face than spectacle of entertainment . People bleed and die horrible deaths . No good deed goes unpunished nor is any bad deed not made worse by circumstance . Its a trip into a world where there is no light . After awhile it becomes an endurance test to see who's going to expire first the audience or the people on the screen . As good as the film is , and it is good , it all becomes too much , especially when you kind of know how its going to come out . Worth a look for those who can deal with the violence and the utter despair . ( should probably be an but its just so bleak )
428067	3079504	257076	6.0	Good action film	The Big Screen version of the small screen cult favorite is a pretty good thriller . No , its not the best movie in the world but a good way to spend two hours . The plot concerns a wanted international criminal who offers 100 million to anyone who will spring him . The action is mostly realistic as are the characters . The real complaint is that the captain is too much of an ass and there are one or two bumps that don't ring true , especially at the end but its not anything that will spoil the fun . Best of all there are a couple of really good action sequences . Recommended , especially on cable
428938	3079504	443632	6.0	Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland go down a well worn road in a good movie that really should have gone straight to cable	Michael Douglas is a secret service agent framed in a plot to kill the President of the US . Kiefer Sutherland is the agent on his tail . Its not a bad movie its just been there done that with form over content film making . There is no real tension because the actors are in roles they've played a dozen or so times before ( Sutherland in 24 each week ) so you can pretty much walk them through whats happening . Thats the problem here , its all been done before , better . The real question is : Do I really need to pay 10 bucks a head to see whats a essentially a big screen TV movie ? I think not . As I said its not bad , its just not worth running out to the theater to see . Wait for cable where this movie really belongs .
428746	3079504	48960	6.0	the Oscar must have been won for how the film plays on the BIG screen	Mike Todd's epic travelogue must have looked spectacular on huge screens of old , but on my 42 inch widescreen TV it was just okay . Yes I've seen the film before but only in pieces or cut up never had I seen it widescreen before , not had I seen in complete in at least a decade . . For the most part its an empty movie . Only Caniflas as Fogg's man servant has any real character since his is really the only person given anything to do . The film lurches from spectacle to spectacle with only the odd moment to get to know the characters . Its one of those movies that really makes you go " how did this win Best Picture ? " . Then again if I saw this in a theater with a huge screen I would have been floored . . . or not . Worth a look for the scenery and because it is a good film-though far from great .
428592	3079504	59686	6.0	First of the Jerry Cotton films is okay , but not as good as the later films	( This is also known as the Violin Case Murders ) First of the Jerry Cotton films is okay but it made me wonder how this spawned numerous sequels . Cotton is an FBI agent who always seems to get the job done . He is described by one character as being able to find clues other people miss . ( I'll come back to that in a minute ) . The plot of the film has Cotton brought into a investigate a series of robbery / murders that have been linked by phone calls from the sister of the moll of the gang to the head of the New York chief of the FBI . Cotton springs into action and from there there the plot spirals out in ways that include a plot to blow up a school full of kids ( referenced in the title ) . In all honesty this is a silly film with Cotton's ability to see things no one else can in the evidence pulling things out of thin air , with Cotton simply stumbling upon a good looking girl who happens to be the girl making the calls and later deducing that the owners of a bowling alley are involved in the case . If you can get past the frequent " huh ? " factor this is a watchable entertainment , but nothing truly memorable . . Worth a look on a slow night of for those who want to see where the later , better Cotton films , came from . ( Also worth a look for the stock and process shots of New York in the early 1960's . They really use a great deal of footage to make it seem like it was shot in New York )
427878	3079504	222812	6.0	Herbert West is back in a wild low brow horror comedy	Comedic Horror film in the HP Lovecraft vein-based on the classic Reanimator film . This is third or fourth in the series and has Herbert West in prison but still continuing his experiments to bring back the dead . Gory and silly , with some genuinely clever bits , this is mostly a splatter comedy of a low brow nature . How low brow ? A rat has a kung fu fight with a severed part of the male anatomy . I caught this on Monster HD and for the most part it amused me but I like this sort of thing , especially if its done well , which it kind of is here . Those who dislike blood or truly sick jokes need not bother . I don't think you can really say much beyond that . 6 .
428359	3079504	756204	6.0	If you like your action with a side order of silly this film is for you .	This is a Thai version of Charlie's Angels . Here there are five girls instead of three . Its a total goof . Everything about the film from the plot ( the angels have to protect a little girl who has a rare pearl ) to the characters ( one is a guy in drag ) to the action sequences ( they are sending up action sequences ) are very silly . At no point are we ever expected to take any of this seriously on any level , even if they are playing it all reasonably straight . If you go in expecting a straight action film you are going to be disappointed . if you go in expecting a Thai blend of action ( the action is the reason to see the film ) and comedy then you are more likely to have a good time . If there is any flaws its that the film doesn't quite work in the non-action scenes . The comedy there comes off as heavy handed . Thankfully the talking scenes tend to be brief . Worth a look for action fans with a high tolerance for silly things . Forgive me for not saying more but the plot is very slight . Its the action that stand out , and thankfully its all set pieces beginning with a fight on an airplane thats cross cut with a fight in a house and car chase on to the kidnapping of the girl to a fight in towels in an office tower on and on to the final girls in white dresses bit which takes things about as far as you can go . Its all well done and very tongue and cheek ( often suitably cheaply ) 6 . 5 over all . 8 or so for the action scenes .
427067	3079504	87915	7.0	Very good sequel to an exploitation classic makes very little sense but is still a great deal of fun to watch	Sequel to Golden Queen's Commandos is just as action packed , though much more nonsensical . The plot of the film begins with a band of women surrounded in an isolated farm house . They have stolen a large horde of gold which the military wants back . They decide that some will make a run for it with the gold while others remain behind . Any survivors will meet back at that spot in a years time to split up the money . Things don't go as planned and the story spirals out into three or ten different directions until we get to the final shoot out . A sequel in that the same cast plays similar characters to the first film , but with different names . Also not everyone is on the same side , nor does everyone have as large a part . This film is further tied to the first by the use of footage from the first film to give a kind of background on some of the characters ( also to signal which character is suppose to be which from the early film since costumes and appearances have changed ) . Very good in a psychotronic sort of way , this film has a plot that makes almost no linear sense what so ever . The plot jumps from gold , to diamonds , to a map , to revenge , to about eight other things depending upon the minute . There is almost no continuity to the whys and wherefores things just sort of happen and people just sort of show up . Its never boring , but it does bend your mind since any attempt at making things make sense is a lost cause . Its so demented that even the giving of one's self over to it only barely reduces the damage , this movie is just too weird . Like the earlier film this film is a mixture of genres , though to be honest this film is basically a western but with other things placed inside it . ( I do have to report that this film does have the musical number the first film didn't have ) I liked this film , I didn't love it . The problem is that its scatter-shot approach makes it much more difficult to love than the earlier film . This doesn't mean you shouldn't see it , you should , especially if you're a fan of the wild films that have come out of Hong Kong of the years or an action nut who doesn't care if everything makes sense .
427670	3079504	780571	7.0	Costner and Hurt Sshine in this tale of a serial killer	Kevin Costner is a great guy and man of the year sort of fellow who has a dark side-he's a serial killer . On one of the biggest nights of his life Brooks gives in to the voice in his head ( played by William Hurt ) and begins to kill again . Unfortunately he's spotted by Dane Cook who wants to go out with him on the next kill . Costner hopes there's no next time however circumstance reawakens the old urge and . . . well thats the movie . Good little thriller is given a great shot in the arm by the interplay of Costner and Hurt . They are the whole movie and are the reason ( a really good reason ) to watch this movie . Worth a look but you may end up like me and wish that Costner and Hurt would link up again in a movie better suited to let them let go .
427350	3079504	1029167	7.0	Good little thriller	Cole Hauser is an under cover FBI agent deep in a criminal organization . Told to torture an accountant by his boss , the unseen Ziggy , to find out where several million dollars in missing money went , Cole starts to realize that things are not as they seem . Good little B movie that probably should have gotten some sort of theatrical release , though its small scale nature probably play better on the small screen . For the most part this is a tight little thriller that keeps things ratcheted up . Its the sort of film that makes you wonder why you hadn't heard of it before . If there is any flaw in the film its that the way the story shifts through time is more than a little confusing . More than once I wasn't sure when I was seeing . ( I'm also out about Laurence Fishburne's performance , but that's another kettle of fish entirely ) Worth a bag of popcorn and a soda . Between 6 and
427421	3079504	56622	7.0	Interesting time capsule look at anti-communist propaganda . Its a political argument and warning in documentary form and not drama in the conventional sense	How do you rate this movie correctly ? I don't know if its possible since this is not really a real movie so much as anti-communist anti-atheist propaganda of a most extreme nature . Basil Rathbone is one of two " few " survivors . He is lecturing to Mary Murphy about the history and evils of communism . Set in an nether world where Rathbone stands at a lectern upon which a large book rests he talks and shows ( in some really grizzly documentary footage ) all of the terrible things that the commies have done . He says he is preparing her for what is to come , so that she can keep her eyes open and not break down . They discuss the godless communist threat and speak of her role as mother and Saviour . Allegory ? Science fiction ? Psycho drama ( in both senses of the term ) ? Your guess is as good as mine . Clearly this film's time has come and gone since the communist " threat " as been replaced by other " threats " in our world . This film is also extremely sexist with the role of the woman reduced to that of breeder and mother . The film makes clear that the role of the woman is to raise kids and suffer as a result ( amazingly the film also acknowledges that she can do more but that society and " god " demands that she do only that ) Watching it now is a rather quaint experience . We really thought like this back in the 1960's , and for good reason , we really were on the brink of nuclear war thanks to things like the Cuban Missile Crisis . The urgency bleeds off the screen . Its not really possible to watch this movie as anything other than a historical document . Its not a narrative movie its a documentary with some very pointed commentary and political orientation . You can't watch this for entertainment like you would a comedy or drama , you have to look at it in terms of history and nostalgia . The performances of both Rathbone and Murphy are suitably intense for this sort of film . Rathbone is a scary authority figure while Murphy is a warm and loving woman , perfectly modulated for getting the point across . I liked it for what it is , anti-communist anti-atheist propaganda from a time now gone . If you watch it with that in mind you'll probably enjoy the experience . However if you watch it expecting a real movie with a plot instead of a political and social argument then you'll be bored silly . for the nostalgia factor .
427025	3079504	481797	7.0	A head trip pulp science fiction film about ideas-its not what you think it is	Francis Ford Coppola returns to completing his own films for the first time in 10 years ( he's been working on Megalopolis which he's more or less abandoned and done some re-shoots for friends ) . He's made a film that is probably best described as philosophical pulp . Its based on a deeply philosophical Romanian novella that has haunted him for much of the last ten years . The plot an aged scholar turning 70 and feeling he has been a failure . Deciding to go to the big city and commit suicide he is struck by lightning not long after arriving and while he is recovering from his injuries it is discovered that he is in fact now seemingly half his age . Its 1938 and during his recovery the Nazi's invade and they take a very keen interest in his condition causing him to flee . Recounting the plot further ( the Nazi bit is more a catalyst then the point since the film covers over 30 years from the point of the lightning strike . ) would be foolish since odds are it will leave you incredulous ( its very mystical and plays at times like a pulp novel with a great deal on its mind ) not to mention give you a false sense of what is really going on . This is a movie that has a definite direction in which it is going and odds are you will not completely see most of it coming . The best thing to do is just buckle up and let the film take you where its going to go . And lets face it this is the sort of story that with slight revision would have fit very nicely in an old copy of Weird Tales . The driving force is very much like a pulp story from the 1930's or 40's . Its very heady stuff . Reincarnation , personality , the question of what is a successful life , the nature of love , language , atomic war , the evolution of man , what would you do with a second chance , are among the many questions raised by this film . The plot is not constructed to be just a ripping story , but rather a means to the examination of the ideas that Coppola is tossing about . Coppola has hung a great many ideas and notions on his narrative threads and he's done so in such away that in order to navigate through the maze the threads form you will have to deal with the laundry hanging from them . Its this juggling of ideas in a pulp frame work that has been the bane of this film . I know that many people don't know what Coppola was getting at , I'm not entirely sure myself . The plot seems almost silly , its almost like Stephen Kings Golden Years but spiced up with almost too many ideas . No doubt its confused people who were looking for another Godfather , Bram Stokers Dracula , The Rainmaker or any other Coppola film . Its not something that an American filmmaker would make , certainly not one of Coppola's pedigree . Then again I would argue it is . the film is very much a European film . It looks and feels like a film that belongs in the line up of a European director . There is nothing typically American in the film at all . It feels alien when compared to most American films . Though if you look at the scenes in Italy in the Godfather , or even the first two Godfather films in total , this film fits neatly into how the earlier films feel visually . There is a lyric beauty and sense of place and time that is rare in films . there is a poetry . Its a film you will have to think about . You have to be willing to let the film go and do what ever it wants to . Certainly one can easily dismiss it as not meeting your expectations , but doing so will cause you to miss out on a film that will get your little gray cells going . Is it a perfect film . No . I like the film and think its a good film . I think its a grasp exceeds its reach . To be perfectly honest somewhere in the last 20 minutes the film shifts gears and goes into a coda ( Coppola's words in the commentary ) that ends the film . Its here I think that the film falters since I don't think the ending really works . No doubt its what the end of the original story is ( in the commentary Coppola talks about what he had to do to make it work on screen ) but its something that didn't translate to the screen well . I was left wondering what it all was about in total . Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it , but I just felt out of sorts and desirous of a second viewing where all of the bits through the film might come together . Perhaps thats the best thing I can say about the film , its not a film one should dismiss until one has had a chance to see the film twice since there are too many pieces that don't connect up until the very end . Worth a look for those willing to work with the film , those will expectations go and for those that like head trips . 7ish out of 10
428273	3079504	74201	7.0	Euro-sleaze film is much better than its should be ( though I doubt you'll ever find it in English )	In these " enlightened times " I'm hard pressed to know if one should admit to having seen this movie , but considering that its actually a pretty good erotic sleaze film , I'll happily say I saw it . The plot is told mostly in flashback . It begins with a young girl seeing her mom have ( simulated ) sex with a dog . Dad comes home drags mom and the girl away and then sets fire to the house with the dog inside . The film then jumps forward as we watch a man waiting for something . The story then flashes back as we see the man and his wife arrive at an island full of party people . Periodically the man and woman catch sight of a young woman with a dog . The woman looks like a younger version of the woman at the start . I'll leave it for adventurous film goers to unravel what happens next , though I will say while its often sexy it all ends badly . Despite this film being in Italian , a language I don't speak , I rather enjoyed this movie . Sure its sleazy but at the same time it seems to be a well done drama with an " off-beat " edge . I had no problems following the plot . I liked that after the opening you were very much of balance wondering what sort of madness was going to show up . Granted its a cheap trick but it did help to keep things properly tense . Obviously this is NOT for all tastes . I think most people will have shut it off during the opening credits . If you can get past them and don't mind sleazy sexy drama I think you'll enjoy this , on some level , if you're open to it . . . . . . Just don't look for an English version of this film . I can't imagine anyone being bold enough to attempt to release this in either England or the US , its opening is just a bit too much for most people .
428533	3079504	39193	7.0	Seemingly forgotten serial is better than it should be thanks to neat gadgets and a go for it attitude	Someone is killing off industrialists with a poison that is similar to the poison of a black widow . The person behind it is the evil Sombra , a woman who is using her fortune telling business as a front for blackmail and espionage . The Clarion Newspaper assigns one of its reporters to follow a well known mystery writer , Steve Colt , that they have hired to solve the crimes . Almost instantly the intrepid pair unknowingly stumbles upon the villainess and her band and 12 chapters of action follow as the bad guys try to stay away from the good guys . Mostly unknown serial is an enjoyable romp thanks to Republic caring enough not to completely do things by the book . Instead of the usual tricks and traps that Republic's serial makers would lapse into in the name of saving a few pennies you have things like the chair of death where a spider like device comes out of the back to stink you to death , or cars that change color with the flip of a dial . It's the equivalent to a really good B-movie that you stumble upon late at night that is completely gripping even though its something you've never heard of . ( Regrettably this serial is also as forgettable in the same way its good but it doesn't linger in the brain as anything other than a vague memory - a " yea I saw that " until you put it on again and you realize how good it was ) . Recommended .
429051	3079504	368891	7.0	Good Popcorn Movie	Completely unbelievable but fun romp around the world looking for treasure . . . it won't win any awards but its a good two hours at the movies . The plot to trying to find a lost treasure a clue to which is on the back of the Declaration of Independence is so beyond belief that its best to simply begin by throwing up your hands and accepting it for what it is . Certainly the cast has thrown reality to the wind and appears to be having a grand time . My only complaint , and its what keeps me from saying you you should see this in a theater instead of renting it , is that the pacing is off . It needs a zipper pace to get us from A to B . Certainly it moves well , but there were times when I just wanted to to move a bit faster . Its a minor fault , but one that prevented me from really loving this . . Definitely worth seeing , preferably for less than what they charge for a full price movie admission these days .
429112	3079504	858486	7.0	In 3D this is a trip to a place you've never been and worth seeing ( in 2D its not quite that )	The plot is a simple one . On an alien world an alien invasion force comes and tries to take over . The aliens are humans who need to terraform the planet for it to be of any use to us . One alien with an incredible ability to build things ends up rescuing a downed human pilot and a bond is begrudgingly formed , that is threatened by an evil earth general . You know the drill . Its a well worn tale that plays okay in 2D . In 3D its another matter . There really is a difference between 3D and 2D with Battle for Terra . The difference between the two ways of viewing the film is vast , greater than with any other 3D film I've seen and there have been a lot . For the first time here is a 3D film who's use of depth has a purpose-it puts you into a world you could never go to . Yes I know I said there is a difference between the 3D and 2D of a good number of films - Beowulf for example , since the 3D in Beowulf made the film a thrill ride . It didn't enhance what was and is a really horrible story . Here the film gets better , yes it makes things better because it gives weight to the events . The characters suddenly become realer . There are no items popping out at you but the film doesn't need it , its not that sort of film . This is a film that puts you into its world . One of the most amazing things in the film is the climatic battle which knocked my socks off in 3D . You've seen space battles in any number of films including the star wars films but here it is in 3D . Amazing . ( George Lucas is rejiggering the Star Wars films in 3D but I doubt the battles will improve them enough to make them any more gee whiz than this films battles ) The writing is not a well worn as the basic plot . Other than Brian Cox's villain things are not entirely clear cut as to characters . People change and shift . The plot also deals with some dark ideas . Frankly there are a couple of twists that I was shocked that the filmmakers had the guts to include in " a children's film " . Its not a children's film . There is death and destruction and I am glad that the film doesn't shy away from it . Actually one of the plot points is the devastation of war . There is some adult writing here and assumption that the audience isn't stupid which is a welcome relief . If you can see the film in 3D I highly recommend you do so . Its a very different case then seeing it flat . Flat this is just another space opera , in 3D its an affecting tale of alien species colliding . Its a trip to a place you've never been . in 3D Around 5 or 6ish out of 10 in 2
427386	3079504	65649	7.0	The pieces are better than the whole in the first film in color ( and in some ways key to all films that follow ) by Akira Kurasowa	The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live . The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump . It's a mix of laughter and sadness . First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I've wanted to see for a long time . Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material . I was holding out for the full version , waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see , only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version . Finally sitting down to see the film last night I'm of mixed emotions about the film . First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed . You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie , down to the painted sunsets . Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with ( of course there are failed projects as well ) . The film is a visual work of art . ( Though be warned if you're going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot 1 . 33 so will appear in normal TV ratio . ) The rest of the film is a mixed bag . Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don't quite come together . As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don't hang as one . I don't blame Kurasowa since one can't always hit things out of the box , especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi-character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself . This isn't to say that there aren't reasons to see the film . As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films , whether they work or not . The first trip of the " trolley " is one of the best things Kurasowa ever did and is worth the price of a rental . Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out . The father and son living in the car is touching ( though ultimately very sad ) and there are other bits and pieces that shine ( like the cast which is across the board great ) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas . Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes . Between 6 and 7 as a whole , much higher in pieces .
428485	3079504	820111	7.0	For lovers of gore and blood by the gallon this is a neat little film-for anyone else this is going to be something to avoid	Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines - which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser . In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected . Technically superb horror comedy ( ? ) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying . Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here , but lets just say its pretty gruesome . If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film . Personally I'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level . Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies . . Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on-as revealed in the end-I want to go back and see what it was I didn't catch on to . There is an internal logic rare in these films . 7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs , its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else .
428996	3079504	91651	7.0	Rethink of the vampire legend is brooding and atmospheric and recommended for those who don't need a another run of the mill vampire film	Christopher Plummer goes to Venice to investigate the last known appearance of Nosferatu during the Carnival of 1786 . Plummer seems to think that the vampire is searching for a means to put an end to his torment and actually be dead . He stays with a family who legend says , has the vampire trapped in a tomb in the basement . After a s√©ance " the vampire " appears and then it becomes a question of how do you put the evil back into the box . Thats a poor description for a very moody , very good rethink of the vampire legend . In theory this is a modern day sequel to Werner Herzog's remake of the FW Murnau's silent original . However other than the fact that Klaus Kinski plays the vampire the films are pretty much separate films . Here the vampire is a force outside of nature , he goes out during the day , religious objects don't affect him and he has powers beyond those of normal vampires . To be honest this film's idea of vampires and their creation is very different than what is considered " normal " vampire lore . This is a film thats a bit more form over content , but its still weaves a magical spell . Its a very atmospheric haunted Venice story where mood and feeling is all . Its a film designed to make you feel creepy and uneasy and not so much scary in " the jump and scream variety " . It helps that the film rethinks what a vampire is . Going back to folklore where things other than a bite on the neck was required to turn someone undead , this film keeps you off balance since you can't be sure what is real with in the film's world . Adding a great deal to the film are the performances of the excellent cast . Christopher Plummer's vampire hunter is a wonderful man of science who's pronouncements give a weight to the proceedings that would me missing in lesser hands . We believe in whats going on , because he does . Even in the early scenes when there is some doubt as to whats real and what isn't Plummer's intensity keeps things on track . Klaus Kinski as the vampire is a brooding , sad , sexual menace that says very little but wanders through his scenes with a power and intensity lacking in most vampires . Here is an ages old world weary soul who is forced to play peoples stupid games but who really just wants to be loved and most of all to die . The cinematography of this film is extraordinary . Venice is a character in every shot . You get a sense of place and of dread with every picture . This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen , and its fog shrouded vistas of Venice in the morning deserve to be hung on the wall . This is an amazing film , more creepy than scary , but one that is none the less haunting . This is a lost treasure for those who can appreciate horror films as being more than just the traditional sort . 7 . ( for IMDb purposes )
428298	3079504	496806	7.0	A nice distraction	Follow up to the two earlier films ( yes there are references to both ) is better and more together than the second film but not as good as the first . Its more of the same with a plot ( getting revenge on Pacino for screwing over Elliot Gould ) thats a movie and not an excuse to party off screen . A bit too leisurely for my tastes ( plot threads meander too much before paying off nicely ) , its still a nice distraction . I liked it a great deal though I will say I was ambivalent until the end , which while not a great pay off was really good . If you want to see it either do so on the big screen or wait for the widescreen DVD since this was shot in a glorious widescreen that will lose a great deal on full screen TV See it , it will distract you for 2 hours-you may not ( probably won't ) love it but you will like it a great deal .
428987	3079504	25712	7.0	Good , but slowly paced independent serial , is worth a look if for no other reason then a rare good guy role for Bela Lugosi	Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit ( which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain . ) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way . Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult . This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun . To be certain the pacing is a bit slack , more akin to one of Principals ( the producing studios ) features then a rip roaring adventure , but it's still enjoyable . This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that " hey I missed something " . One of the trilogy of three good serials Lugosi made , the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
426975	3079504	35372	7.0	One of the best serials Republic ever did	Probably considered a close second to The Adventures of Captain Marvel as the best of all serials . This too is a comic adaptation , but of a comic almost no one has seen in 60 years since it was a war related comic that died a painful death when the " enemy " went away and Spysmasher was forced to fight regular criminals . The plot has Spysmasher - a reporter who faked his own death so he could fight the enemy on their own terms - returning to America to stop The Mask from flooding the country with counterfeit money as well as doing other terrible things . It's a rip roaring adventure that moves like the wind . Republic spent a nice chunk of change on the film and it shows with production values that seem a little more than normal . If there is a flaw its that the film is so action packed that watching it in one or two sittings you become aware how little plot there is . Yes it moves like the wind and yes it's the perfect serial to be seen one chapter each week , but as a something to watch it one sitting its almost too much motion . Granted this was never intended to be seen in one sitting so its understandable that there are " problems " ( and minor ones at that ) . Action film and comic nuts really should see this . It's a blast and a half , especially if you like to watch the old wartime films from the 1940's .
427906	3079504	452592	7.0	Graphicly violent fact based tale rise above its genre but is not for the squeamish	Nasty film based on the killings in Matamoros Mexico where the search for a missing student turned up a drug running operation using black magic as a cover and to empower its members . The plot of the film has three buddies going to Mexico for spring break . One goes missing , kidnapped by the cult and the other two go looking for him and end up in a world of trouble . Violent nasty and at times down right ugly horror film that is extremely unpleasant . Graphic to the point of unpleasantness this is one to keep away from the kiddies . There is a real tension created in the film that manages to make you feel very uneasy . The performances are all fine , including Sean Astin playing against type as an American member of the cult . Its a sobering wake up call to anyone who goes wandering in foreign lands on spring break . As films of this sort ( Turistas , Hostel , etc ) go this one is one of the best . I know it could be considered faint praise for a genre that is for the most part little more than death porn , but there is a real gravitas that other films don't have . I don't think its the " based on true events " ( which it really is despite what some people say ) because this film is far enough removed that it based on the events and not a dramatization . Its a good nasty little film-if you like that sort of thing . I have only one real reservation and that the pacing is , for a good portion of the film , while okay , still makes you wish they would get on with things . Recommended for those who like graphic nastiness in a fact based story . If you can't stand graphic violence look elsewhere .
428751	3079504	985699	7.0	If only I could have forgotten how it was going to end I would have thought this one of the best of the year	Bryan Singers film about the plot to kill Hitler is a very good one . ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Wonderfully acted , especially when it gets going , it has one of the best ensemble casts I've seen . This is beautiful to look at with a real sense of being in the Nazi world . And it is at times a taut film about a plot to kill the Fuhrer ( I know you can all here the " but " coming , so I won't disappoint you ) BUT the film has one large problem , we know how it turns out . Forgive me for saying that unless you really don't know your history you know the plan fails and everyone dies . Short of them rewriting history there is one and only one way this can go , and its not really a happy one . This doesn't mean there is no tension , there is , it just means there are no surprises except in the details . For me the films inability to transcend the fact we know it ends badly keeps it from being a being a great film and instead making it only a good one . Its is possible to make a great film about a failed event , one need only look at Khartoum or the Alamo to see two films that hold you in such away that you forget the ending . Don't get me wrong its a good film , I just wish they had made me forget the ending at the start . ( Counter point recent films where I knew the ending and didn't care or forgot it in the flow : Milk , Che , Frost / Nixon )
428175	3079504	16629	7.0	A good version of the story	This film , like the play that it comes from asked the audience to keep the secret of the Bat secret so I will do the same and so I'll only speak in generalities . One of the grand old dark house films this is the story of the super criminal known as The Bat and his attempt to steal a great fortune . This film isn't the best ever made . The passage of time has diminished its impact a bit . Part of the problem is that at times the film has to wrestle with its stage origins , things seem to stagnate and you become bored . However at other times this film soars with a visual style that has rarely been matched . The mask of the villain for example hasn't been equaled . Thankfully its always watchable . Certainly worth a look .
428303	3079504	844708	7.0	Really good but unnecessary remake is one of the best of the recent glut of retread horror films and a fine horror film on its own	Remake of the Wes Craven horror classic ( considered by some ) that was based on Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring . The basic plot is simple . A band of villains brutalize a couple of girls out in the woods . When they need to take shelter they do so at the home of a nice family . All is going well until the family discovers that the visitors tortured their daughter and they decide to see that justice is done . Well made revenge flick with amped up violence and nastiness was an odd viewing experience for me . yes its well done and tense , with villains that really need killing , but now 35 years down the road the original has been riffed on so many times that there is little thats new here except the level of violence . I don't see why , other than for money ( despite no prospect for a sequel ) , why the original had to be remade . Then again I'm thrilled that here was a remake that doesn't stink . I mean how many horror films from the 1970's and 80's have been remade badly recently ? Yes its good . Yes its exactly what you think its going to be . No its not required viewing . If you like this sort of thing and know what you're getting into give it a shot .
428100	3079504	438986	7.0	A good film that you've probably never heard of and that deserves your attention , especially if you love films about horses .	Its a sad commentary on American film viewing that most films from Asia not having to do with action or horror are completely left out of the loop . This is a very good movie that deserves a bigger audience in the States and elsewhere . The story of the film , very briefly , goes as follows : A girl who's mother was a jockey and who died in a riding accident , grows up with a passion for horses and a desire to follow in her mothers footsteps . Of course her father disapproves but she pursues her dream anyway . This Korean family film is quite possibly the best looking film about horses ever made . This is a rich and gorgeous visual experience that is a joy to behold . I have never seen horses look this good ever . If you think horses are beautiful magical creatures this film is for you . The cast is first rate with everyone turning in excellent performances , including the horses . I don't know if its clever editing or if the film makers got some remarkable horses but there are times when the horses seem to be keeping up with the humans on screen . Just watch the early scenes between the young version of our heroine and General , one of the horses , its a dead heat as to who is giving the better and more charming performance . The story is equally good even when it moves into clich√©d territory . It does have some clich√© to it , it is after all a film about a girl and her horse , but that more par for the course than anything else . At the same time the film takes some atypical turns with some darker happenings that most western films would never touch ( its not always happy ) . I really liked this movie . How much ? I had picked this film up with the intention of taking a quick look at it before handing it to a horse loving friend . . . well is not getting it , except as a loaner . Not perfect , but definitely worth a look .
428637	3079504	304711	7.0	Actually quite good if you give yourself over to it	This should have retained the title Sineater since thats more to the point of what the film is about . This is one of those movies that shows signs of being tinkered with , mostly in that chunks of it don't make sense , or a sense that seems to have been cut out . Basically the film has Heath Ledger as a priest going to Rome to investigate the death of the head of his order . Its more complicated than that , and for a good chunk of it , it doesn't make sense , not that it ever fully does . Frankly for good or bad this film is going to stay with me for a long time . Its not what ever it was advertised as , its an occult mystery thats closer to the Club Dumas , the source of the Johnny Depp movie , the 9th Gate , than to a conventional horror film . I like the film . Its very flawed but its interesting enough and raises some good questions about salvation and the church . If you want to try something different , and don't mind that its not perfect , I say try this . ( forgive me there is an urge to wax poetic about bits of it . . . )
427644	3079504	820466	7.0	Better than the title suggests	Good B-scifi film with an awful title . The plot has an alien race trying to build a worm hole terminal on earth so they can leave their dying planet and forcibly take over the earth . They only thing stopping them is an single alien who wants revenge . What can I say its turn your brain off time at the old homestead . The best way to describe this is a way better than average SCIFI Channel original film . Its a better than average TV movie that just works with in its limits and goes . Certainly its nothing you haven't seen before but its sense of seriousness makes it worth your time in front of the TV screen . If there is any flaw its the invulnerability the aliens have , it kind of takes the edge off the danger . Still if this had a better title people would be eating this up .
428012	3079504	56472	8.0	Perfect Rainy Day Movie	Darius , son of of the king of Sparta is thrown into the arena for allowing five gladiators to escape . Fighting and winning a huge victory he is freed . Returning home he finds his father dead , supposedly a suicide , but really murdered by the new King . Rounding up the gladiators he helped escape he fights to get back his throne . This is a good movie . It starts and goes right to the end with no side trips . Even the romance which normally handled badly in most films of this type doesn't intrude , although it isn't really resolved either . Its the perfect rainy day film where everything simply works .
428457	3079504	34968	8.0	The Natives are Restless and a Lot of Fun	Stranded at a jungle outpost a singer tries to make her way home . Through circumstances beyond her control she ends up in the jungle on the run from Nazi's and the police who think she maybe connected to a murder . Reluctantly coming to her aid is a scientist with Mantan Moreland as an aide de camp . Back lot bound with some twists that must have been put in let the audience know that none of this was to be taken seriously , Law of the Jungle is an imperfect but very funny jungle adventure / comedy . Our heroine for once seems to be what she claims , a tough broad from Brooklyn way over her head . Her whiskey barrel voice is a nice change from the typical female shriek . Mantan Moreland is , as always , a joy to watch and how he shoots dice has to go down as one of the worst , and funniest scams in B movies . Is this the greatest movie ever made ? No , but its one you will be sorry to see end , especially when you see Moreland and the King interact . . This is one to look for , especially since its out on cheaply priced DVD .
427305	3079504	405325	8.0	Great Comic Book Superhero Movie	Teenaged superhero angst in a friendly Disney sort of way . . . and whats wrong with that ? Will Stronghold is going off to the first day of high school . Since Mom and dad are the world's greatest superheroes he's off to Sky High for the kids of superheroes . The trouble is he has no powers , a fact he hasn't told dad about . Shunted off to side kick training , something he doesn't tell dad about , Will has to deal with not only the pressures of going to school , but also the problems of being the sidekick son of the world's greatest heroes . I smiled and I laughed as they got the story so wonderfully right . Its goofy and off beat and its aimed at a certain audience , which means it should work for no audience but some how it works . It reminds me of those wonderful superhero stories from the 1960's at DC when things were very serious and not so serious at the same time . We have a bunch of nice kids who sort of get along , a villain from the past out for revenge , giant robots attacking cities , super powers and ago for it attitude . Maybe its a live action Teen Titans with the kids learning the ropes . Yes , the effects are cheesy . . . but how could you expect great effects in a story like this ? It wouldn't work , it would just make the rest of it work less well . It fits the timber of the story , its comic book made movie My only complaint is the pacing gets a tad slow when we come to romance . Sorry to say that the battle between which girl will get Will's affection is the only slow part - but its minor , before long there's some super battles taking place and all is right with the world . And if you have any doubts about the quality of the film consider we have BOTH Bruce Campbell , as Coach Boomer , the man who chooses whether you're a hero or side kick ; and Dave Foley as Mr Boy , one time side kick to Kurt Russell's Commander Stronghold and now teacher for the sidekicks . This is a tough movie to rate . As a movie looked at coldly and rationally its probably a seven or eight . However as a movie that makes you grin and smile and laugh your knowing ass off its easily a nine . I really like this movie emotionally and can't wait for the DVD . ( Note to Disney : please no more , unless you have a really really good script and please no TV series , that will kill the charm instantly )
427314	3079504	286306	8.0	Very Good Horror Story	Set in the trenches of the First World War this is the first film I've seen set during that time that got the sense of place right . Its the got the entombed bodies in the ground , in the walls , and everywhere you look right . It is a bleak existence that the soldiers take almost matter of factly . The plot has a group of British soldiers getting lost during an attack and finding a German trench . The Germans are more concerned with something in the trench to pay the Brits any mind and try to send them away . All but one of the Germans are shot , but because of a language problem he can't tell them whats is lurking close by . Beautifully shot , excellently acted this is a very good little horror film . No , its not the be all and end all of horror films but its a damn good little thriller that rises about the typical thanks to its setting and the cast . This is a film worth putting a bit of effort into finding . I doubt that you'll hate it if you find it , at the very least you'll come away liking it . .
428563	3079504	389326	8.0	Even if you don't like surfing this is a great movie	I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked . The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves , waves that are monstrously huge , waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves . There is nothing special about the film , other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk . Sure there are scenes of them surfing , but what makes this movie so special is the people . Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching . Half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well . Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film . See it .
428078	3079504	106384	8.0	Amazing look at belief	Portrait of superstition and faith in Russia . Completely neutral Werner Herzog film simply shows the people as they are and lets them speak for themselves . One is a " reincarnation " of Christ speaking of love and brotherly love . Another is a man who plays the bells at a church . We see a faith healer and mystic blessing a couple . We also spend time at a village near a Russian lake . Here is its said that God saved a village from the Mongol Hordes by placing it at the bottom of a lake , where if the conditions are right you can see it through the ice when the lake freezes in the winter . Nonjudgmental to the point that anything approaching a voice over is simply the translation of the words of those we see on screen . Even the " silliness " of the people who live near the lake with their crawling around it from holy site to holy site ceases to be funny when you realize that these people actually believe in what they are telling you . It's a haunting film that makes you wonder about how and what some people believe . Highly recommended .
429039	3079504	165982	8.0	Once it gets going this is a great adventure	Its an odd mix of computer and regular animation who's blending doesn't always seem seamless . It does work better than Dreamworks earlier Spirit since the mix helps to add to the other worldliness of some of the bits . The basic plot has Sinbad trying to steal The Book of Peace from a ship on the ocean . When he finally runs down the ship he finds its commanded by a boyhood friend . Not one to stand on ceremony he attempts to steal the book only to be interrupted by a kraken like being sent by the goddess Eris . Together the pair defeat the beast , in one of the great set pieces of the film , but in the process Sinbad is swept overboard only to be rescued by Eris who tells him to steal the book for her and she'll make him rich . Sinbad agrees , but for reasons left for the viewing , he backs out only to be blamed for the theft anyway . His friend knows he's innocent and takes his place so Sinbad can attempt to get the book back with in the ten days before his execution . Thats the first fifteen minutes . Its not as exciting as all of that , these fifteen minutes I mean , since its badly handled exposition done to get the plot really moving . I have a suspicion that the voyage was designed before the framing sequences and that the inclusion of Eris was done simply because it was a way to get the wheels in motion and have a magical air to it all . The voice cast is uniformly excellent . It is quite possibly the best voice cast of this stature that I've seen in a long time . ( That should be heard ) . The joys of the listening to Pitt , Pfeiffer , and Zeta-Jones is that they really are acting and really are selling the film . I can imagine everyone being on set and acting together even though the fact is far from the truth . The writing is excellent and you can see that the film really was written as if it were a live action film in the way that the characters hang together is a more real way than in many animated films where characters are of a type and nothing more . Here the characters are people which is nice . Because the writing is so good the reasons for things are clearer than in most animated films these are people reasons not cartoon reasons , for example the reason why Sinbad was gone for ten years could only have been come upon by someone who wrote a real script instead of fumbled around with a storyboard . This small moment is , for me one of the high points of the film . The dialog is fantastic , witty and snide and dead nuts on . The film is best viewed as a film that exists only for the voyage since thats the best part and what a voyage it is . Here the film becomes a series of wonderful set pieces that are joy to behold , but are at times regrettably undercut by the bad directed linking material . Beyond saying ignore the links I want to say little about the actual film other than that the kraken sequence , the dragons teeth sequence , the island hopping , the snow bird and several others are fantastic adventure sequences that rouse you up and get you into the mood to go adventuring . This is great stuff . And while this is a grand adventure it should be stated that this is a grand ROMANCE . Oh my word its wonderful , pull those little heart strings why don't you . This is the romance of Nick and Nora or Spencer and Susan , but with action added in . And even as I wax poetic about the movie I must remind you that even as the voyage builds to a conclusion the movie wobbles a bit at the end , not the very end , but a couple of minutes before when I was going to myself , " thats it ? You mean all of that and thats it ? " Its bad direction I'm telling you ( that or studio interference ) . there shouldn't be that bump towards the end . . . But lest you worry it picks up and ends with a bang
427531	3079504	56035	8.0	This one has everything , and then some	The question I'm asked is why do I watch movies like this with any frequency ? The answer has to do with the monsters and the fact that many of these things throw everything at you except for the kitchen sink , and that's only left out because it wasn't invented yet . After a war ends Goliath prepares to head home , except that Bokan , the regent of his country has sent assassins to kill Goliath since he is the only one who could take the place of the dead king , a fact that would put Bokan out of a job . Bokan is not standing for any opposition to his rue and he pitches anyone who doesn't like him into a valley where giants live , Giants who were put there by Goliath years before . Trying to get home faster Goliath and his friends try to go by sea but get waylaid on the voyage . Its at this point that the movie throws in everything except the kitchen sink , and perhaps aliens , as Goliath has to face a storm at sea , sea monsters , assassins , Amazons , a gorilla , lions , weird torture devices , gladiators , cave men and giants . I'm sure I'm forgetting something , but I don't know what . Best of all the whole thing is told spectacularly and with a decent budget , something that is missing from most movies of this sort . My only complaint is that it gets a bit draggy in the middle for a couple of minutes , but other than that this is a really good mindless adventure . If you want to see a movie with everything give this a try .
427488	3079504	825232	8.0	Go with it and you'll love it	Contrived and artificial confection like a Twinkie that is completely enjoyable if you go with it . The premise is that Jack Nicholson who's rich but unhappy and Mogan Freeman who's poor and happy both end up with terminal cancer . Bonding in a hospital room they decide to create a list of things to do before they die and then do them . Its a feel good weepie thats there to make you feel like getting off your duff and doing something . . . until the tears stop and you change the channel . Flaws aside its a really good movie for what it is .
428120	3079504	56104	8.0	An off beat telling of the Legend	Unable to support the war in Troy , the Greeks begin raiding along the coast . While the classic heroes are off raiding the Trojans try a sneak attack against those that remain behind . Just as the battle turns against the Greeks , Achilles arrives to save the day . . . so goes the first 20 minutes of the film . This is a telling of the end of the Trojan war just prior to the death of Achilles . Its a very strange film in that for a good portion of it you really can't stand the Greeks who are more interested in raping than fighting the war . They are shown to be petty people who are not really heroic and who spend more time fighting over women and gold than matters of state . This is a big movie with a cast of thousands so you really do get armies clashing . Unfortunately the movie is very unfocused and feels stretched by about 20 minutes , which is a shame since its one of the best made films of this genre , but its not the best told . I liked it but I wanted to love it .
428902	3079504	493430	9.0	If you're a fan and know what you're in for see this movie , it's better than the first film . If you don't know what this movie is avoid it like the plague	How do you review something thats review proof ? Simply put this is a collection of twisted painful gross out stunts that will appeal to the twelve year old in all of us . Its better than the first film in that there is almost no set up for each bit , its just one thing after another after another . It never stops , it never slows and its frequently in really bad taste . Its a greatest hits for an un-aired season . Not that I mind . I'm amused by this sort of thing when its done well and here it is . So for 90 minutes I was a twelve year old again and was totally content to watch people hurt themselves . If your inner child is still twelve and very low brow see this film . ( And just a word of warning-if you want to take your kids to this , don't . This film is rather graphic in many ways that should have gotten this film an NC17 rating . This is for adults who think they are still kids . )
428867	3079504	836682	9.0	Great magical film that improves with each viewing and needs to be seen by anyone looking for a good film not just a good animated one	Tim is a little boy who is afraid of the dark , but loves the stars . Every night he drags his bed to the window so he can be watched over by his star . One night unable to sleep he climbs to the roof of the orphanage and looks out over the city and notices that the stars , including his star , are going out . In his frenzy to do something he falls off the roof , but is rescued by the Cat Shepherd . The Cat Shepherd is in charge of the cats that watch over all of the children and help put them to sleep at night . When Tim refuses to go to sleep The Cat Shepherd agrees to help Tim get to see the head of Nocturna the world of the night , who might be able to help him solve the problem of the missing stars . This in turn becomes a journey across the night world as Tim tries to find the source of the darkness . I've seen Nocturna twice in two days and while I really liked it after the first viewing I fell even more under its spell upon the second . This is quite simply a magical movie that improves with each viewing ( I'm planning yet another viewing in the next day or so ) . Trust me this is a great film . If you've ever wondered why your hair is messed up in the morning , or who makes the noises at night , or who steal your socks this movie is for you . As Tim goes through the night world he discovers the answers to these and other questions ( which are referenced through out the movie and seeing how they are is what makes the film so much fun on multiple viewings ) Its magic . Watching the film I was reminded of other films , Monsters Inc , Spirited Away , Moongirl , and a few others , but seconds after I thought that the film was like one thing I almost instantly realized that I was wrong , it maybe like these films for a moment , but in the end they are nothing like them , this is a film that creates its own unique world ( which is clearly evident in its design , music and witty dialog ) . This is a film that ultimately is a unique masterpiece . ( If nothing else the familiarity that flashes up makes the film more special in that it makes it easier to believe that what we see happening in the film is really what happens in our world after we fall asleep ) . This film needs to be seen , by anyone who wants to see a good movie - not just an animated film or a kids film - just a good film . It's special . Search this one out . And why doesn't this film appear to have a US distributor ? I had to see this as an imported region 2 DVD ( Which has a super English voice cast . ) This is an animated film that deserves to be seen as big as possible . I regret not seeing it at the New York Children's Film Festival when I had the chance because the thought of seeing Tim moving through the city on the big screen is just too amazing to contemplate ( It looks great on a big screen TV but on a big movie screen its probably even better ) .
427181	3079504	1215881	9.0	Simply the words that sent the US to war and made everyone think it was the right thing to do .	Documentary consisting of nothing but statements from speeches and interviews from members of the Bush White House and its allies showing the march toward war in Iraq from just after / 00 to the start of the war . Its a damning collection of film that illustrates what many people always suspected , the war in Iraq was a long time in planning and they were going to manipulate everyone and everything to get us in there . What is so powerful is that its just the words that were used to manipulate th populace into backing a war that really should never have happened . There is no commentary only the ever changing words and stories that were told and believed . The effect is chilling . I'm sure its a film that will be studied for years to come . A must see because we need to know how we got here and so we're armed so it never happens again .
428075	3079504	191182	9.0	Probably the best film portrait of Hitler . Rewarding both first and later viewings	The best documentaries manage to do two things at the same time : First they teach those who don't know anything about a subject about that subject . At the same time they will enlighten those already knowledgeable on a subject in some way either with new information or a different point of view . The film Hitler A Career manages to do both . Made in 1977 in Germany I have yet to see a documentary on Hitler that is as good as this . Focusing on Hitler this film basically shows you who he was and why he did what he did . This is Hitler in his words and deeds with some very good narration tying it all together . Take for example the opening sequence of a speech Hitler gave when he came to power . Not only do we really get to see and hear a good portion of the speech but we are made very aware of how Hitler is speaking . The slow building nature of the oratory , the pauses , the hand gestures , its all laid out . I had read about how he gave a speech but until this film I never real saw how he did it . The film then moves on and put Hitler into the context of the time and himself . Its done in such away as to be filled with many " Ah Ha ! " moments . We don't see things that don't relate to the man , we just see the things that he did , influenced him and reacted to . Most films on Hitler try to show you some larger picture , this film doesn't , its presenting the man as a man and not a cypher or a personification of evil and the understanding you get is immeasurable . I've been studying the second world war all my life and its rare that I come across a film that makes me rethink what I already knew . Even better is the fact that as I learn more about the conflict as a whole , re-watching this film reveals new facets I never noticed before . I long ago taped this from the History Channel and re-watched it several times . I recently was given a copy on DVD and find that I'm again reviewing it and learning every time . In the thirty years since the film was made there have been way too many films on the Hitler and the Second World War , but I don't think that very many are this good . Certainly I haven't seen a biography of Hitler this good . If there are any flaws I'm certain that they would be due to history and historical research moving on while the film remains a time capsule . Highly recommended .
428034	3079504	396555	9.0	One of the best Disney films in years	Trying to figure out when the last time a movie from Disney proper charmed me like this , not sure . I love the Hefalump movie and I'm a fan of Treasure Planet - though once Martin Short shows up I think it goes off the rails . Hefalump aside ( Thats a TV movie on the big screen - so I'm dismissing for purposes of comparison on that technicality - though its easily one of my favorite Disney films ) I think this probably the one film from the Mouse House I'm happiest with since Lilo and Stitch . Is it the equal of Lilo ? no it doesn't have the " This is my family , its broken but still good " moment that makes me cry every time - nor , and most importantly it does not have the bra wearing caped crusader ( though there are moments and lines . . . ) What the film has , that most other Disney films don't , and which is the reason that Lilo , and Treasure Planet and the other really good films work , is the characters . Lets face it this movie is about characters - and how they interact . The plot - the time travel to the future and stop the baddie plot , isn't all that great , but the pieces are - all of the jokes , and emotion and everything else comes out of the people in the film . yes they are people , even the frogs and the t-rex and the hat . They created personalities for everyone and everything in this film . Thats why the film works . You're in a place with real people , there are no cookie cutter characters , there are different people , not ones a dog , and ones a chicken and ones a fish or a pig like in Chicken Little . ( which has moments - and two or three real characters ) . No one is a stereotype or if they are they bend the rules - the bowler hat man is typical Snidely Whiplash characterization , but its turned on its head - things are not what you think they are with him . I loved that they dressed up what you expect with things you don't - the twist of who the Robinsons are-what you can't guess ? - twist Rules that you would expect from old time travel movies to make a new sort of sense . Frankly the plot is disposable - but the people are not . the lines of dialog are not . I would love to know what was cut out of this film-65 % of it was apparently removed and re-shot-I'd love to know what was there ( Hello DVD ) - what gems might it contain . I'm guessing the film was more rambling - probably like Robots . I loved this movie , I've been thinking about it since I saw it , which is unheard of on a Disney film-more importantly I'm not remembering the jokes , but the people and the sets and the gee whiz feeling I had . I really want to see it again .
428018	3079504	295721	9.0	Beyond mindless	If you want to see a hysterical but incredibly mindless film this is it . The plot has to do with a gang of thieves dressed as Santa pulling off a string of robberies . Its up to a klutzy cop and a taxi driver to stop them . The plot here is just an excuse for a series of very funny set pieces , the drug store scene in which the taxi driver tries to find out what a pregnancy tester is had me on the floor . Forget the plot , not only will you be way way way ahead of everyone on screen it ceases to make any sense two thirds of the way in . Still the film remains fall down funny to the end .
428496	3079504	69747	9.0	A relationship of a life time	I first saw this when I was a kid on its first US release back in the early 1970's . I laughed to kill myself and thought it was one of the funniest things I had ever seen . The quest to see the movie again over the last 30 years has been a labor of love . I don't think it ever aired on New York TV and its showings on cable can be counted on one hand . I was lucky enough to see it a a local revival theater a few years ago before it completely disappeared . Thanks to E-Bay I recently picked up a VHS copy and now comes word that a US release on DVD is moments away . Life couldn't be better . The one thing the handful of viewings of the film has taught me is that the movie plays differently every time I see it . Depending on mood it I may find it to be one of the funniest or one of the most charming films movies ever made . Some sequences in one viewing will leave me gasping for breath while other times it will simply make me smile . No matter though I've enjoyed it each time I've watched it . The story of a bigot who gets way laid and ends up on the run all over France only to end up posing as a beloved Rabbi , is ripe with comic potential most of which is put to good use . Also put to good use are some twists that no rational person would come up with , but which work in the context of a wild comedy , the bubble gum factory for example . This is a wonderful life affirming story that makes you laugh until you cry while showing that ultimately we are all the same . Which is kind of tragic in view of the films opening shots which are some of the earliest film footage shot at the World Trade Center , which had just opened . If you like to laugh see this movie , its wonderful .
427921	3079504	64068	9.0	The search for love , identity and place in a Tokyo bar is a one of the great " unknown " films of cinema	Eddie is a transvestite hostess at one of Tokyo's clubs . He / she spends her time working , being in the films of a friend , taking drugs and trying to find love . Said to be one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films and a big influence on Clockwork Orange this is probably one of the best films most people have never seen . Released in 1969 this film is as fresh and shattering as it must have been back when it was made . Set in a " Gay " world this is actually a movie about people and how they act and feel , the fact that they are gay is irrelevant . These are real people in a real world that seems to be happening now instead of when it was made ( due no doubt to the stunning black and white photography ) . The film uses just about every 1960 " art film " technique you can think of and does so better than any film in from Europe ever did ( Bu√±uel , and Bergman should have been this successful ) . Interviews of the cast , sudden juxtaposition of scenes , shifts in tone and style , sudden bursts of violence , all blend together to tell a story of a search for identity and place that is in its way universal , even if its outcome is not . This is a movie that is simple to explain , but difficult to sum up . The effect of it being somewhat greater than the simplicity of the storyline . See this movie . This is one of those movies that movie lovers should search out . ( Because to be honest I'm not sure if I'm more in love with the technique or the film itself - though either way its a great film )
427743	3079504	113858	9.0	Either except it as a cheesy romp and love it or take it seriously and hate it	This movie is in constant rotation on SciFi and its another one of those movies that I stop at each time its on . The plot has badly done giant mosquitoes attacking people in the country side . They have been mutated after feeding on the blood of dead aliens . . . I know you're shocked , you were expecting a high class movie ( even with the title Mosquito ) and instead you got a very silly movie played ( reasonably ) straight by everyone involved . Clearly the cast and crew knew this was a silly idea , but they milk it for all its worth turning the attack scenes into something you both wince at ( for the idea of it ) and groan at ( the silliness of the execution ) . This is one of the rare modern attempts at a drive in movie that walks the fine line between being serious and being mocking to create something thats enjoyable despite the dumbness of it all . If you can take it on its own level its worth two bags of popcorn and a couple of sodas . If you can't take it for what it it is then you're in for a long painful viewing experience . on the brain dead fun-o-meter .
427700	3079504	59936	9.0	Graphic meditation on life death and honor	( This review contains graphic spoilers ) Only film directed by Yukio Mishima is a 30 minute story about honor and death . Based upon one of his short stories Patriotism tells the story of a Captain involved in the 1936 coup against the Japanese government who is ordered to kill all of the conspirators . The Captain though involved in the planing did not take part out of deference to his wife . The conspirators never betrayed his part in in the plan . Unable to turn his back on his loyal friends he chooses to commit suicide as does his wife . Brief graphic tone poem that was filmed on a Noh stage , it is felt by many as one of the numerous dress rehearsals for Mishima's own bloody end . Shot in a moody black and white with a sense of unreality that makes it very real , this is a fetishistic mediation on life , death and honor that effects the viewer in an extremely visceral way . ( I will leave the viewer to get what he can from its sound and images ) . Its a kick in the gut even before we get to the suicides as we are forced to think about honor and what it means to alive . The suicide , though filmed silent ( the soundtrack is a scratchy record of European classical music ) is so intense that one can almost hear the scream from Mishima's lips when he drives the blade into himself . I won't say anymore other than its drawn out and graphic in a way I've never seen before . ( clearly there is a reason why those committing Seppuku are helped along by a friend who beheads them . ) I was left shaken by the experience . I can not imagine how audiences in 1966 when this was made reacted when they saw it for the first time . I knew what was going to happen and it still unnerved me . I know I will be contemplating it for days to come . I don't know what to say . It is a masterpiece that is weirdly overshadowed by its creators death and life . It is a haunting experience for those with a strong will .
427227	3079504	381849	9.0	A great film and one of the years best	Its been a while since I saw this and I'm still trying to find some words . The plot concerns a noted outlaw , Russel Crowe , caught in a small town . He has to be taken to a larger city with a rail connection where he will put him on the titled train . Along for the ride is a rancher , played by Christian Bale , a slightly disgraced man with a family and mounting debts who's trying to do the right thing even though his kids and his wife don't understand him or his choices . As the men get closer to the train the run into several obstacles , not the least of which are Crowe's men who are very intent on freeing their leader , no matter what the cost . A remake of a 1957 " classic " western this updated retelling adds some shading and some violence for a creation that is uniquely its own . Violence aside this film seems to belonging more in the classic era of the western . However " old fashioned " though it maybe in the telling ( as someone said in a review its clear that no one told director James Mangold that the western was dead ) , the film benefits from the muddying of the moral sensibilities since things are never as clear as the may have been in a by gone time . Why anyone is doing anything is never clear , even the hero played by Bale who is clearly carrying a chip on his shoulder the size of Montana . This grayness helps to make the good guys seem better and the bad guys worse since we know that what ever choice they have made its at great personal expense . Some are hailing the film as a classic , others are liking it but not loving it . I'm really confused about it . To be certain the film is close to being , if not on , the list of best films of the year ( I also keep wanting to use the term mythic , especially since it seems to shift into that mode at times ) . The question for me is whether its a classic or not . I've been going back and forth on the subject for the couple of hours and I still don't have an answer , which is why I can't really write about the film , even though it deserves to deeper discussion .
429055	3079504	364569	10.0	YES IT IS THAT GOO	After getting out of a hotel room like prison a man searches for answers and revenge . The description is simple , direct and probably the best way to explain this great film . Its not that a more detailed recounting of the plot would ruin it like say the Sixth Sense , or The Village , rather its simply that the plot is so layered that to know more simply may result in too much confusion . Containing a central performance that is simply one of the best performances of the last five or ten years this film is Oscar worthy from top to bottom , which is a shame since as of this writing the film has not yet been released in the United States where it would undoubtedly blow away almost any film it comes in contact with . Ultimately it is better than even the Michael Moore film it lost to at Cannes . This is grand film making and I can not recommend it highly enough . However be warned , its violent and dark at times . It will disturb you , the same way that Silence of the Lambs or Seven disturbed you ( although there are no serial killers ) .
427235	3079504	416717	10.0	Forget the plot . Simply put this is one of the greatest , most action packed movies ever made , even if it only cost two bucks to make	In English this film is called The Biggest Fist . What can I say about a movie that lifts its action scenes from mis-matched American movies ( They flipped sequences from Diamonds are Forever so the words are backwards , use the chase from Goldfinger , and I'm trying to figure out where the motorcycle sequences come from ) , has the car the hero drives change repeated through out a sequence , only pauses for two minutes at a time for drinks ( no really ) , has a sveltely pre-Xena wanna be in spandex as the kick ass heroine , has a beauty contest in the middle of it for no reason , a cat-fight for the affections of the hero - during which he sits and reads the paper , has more martial arts action then any ten Hong Kong films , loses its logic half way in - but keeps going , had bad visual effects ( except for those it stole ) and is in Turkish with no subtitles ? The only thing to say is five stars , , one of the best schlock action films ever made . Pure dreck but worth three bags of popcorn and two gallons of soda . This is pure devil may care / lets make a movie no matter how we have to get the footage cinema which was some how released to paying customer-albeit in Turkey . Amazing , absolutely amazing . . . and really watchable even if you have no idea what they're saying or doing or why ( Maybe its better that way ) . If you can go with the badness and surf it , this is one of the great cinema treasures of action chiefdom . A movie to hunt down and enjoy repeatedly
428229	3079504	863136	10.0	A modern classic	Updated retelling of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf is a masterpiece of stop motion animation . Set in modern Russia it pretty much follows the story of young Peter going out into world despite his Grandfathers warning and encountering a wolf . What makes this film so special is that the film has so many small touches that add life and magic to the oft told tale . Look at all of the facial expressions . These are not inanimate objects these are real people and real characters . Look at all of the eyes how alive they seem . Director Suzie Templeton has added a much needed element , danger , to the proceedings . In all the years and all of the countless times I've heard the piece I never really feared for Peter or his friends , here at last I do . Its an edgy retelling that is more emotive since Peter is in very real danger of getting hurt or killed . There is an edge and a weight to the proceedings that I've never experienced before . Its not fair to compare this to the Disney version since they are two very different takes on the same story . Both valid , both excellent , but not rightly compared . Make an effort to see this film , it quite possibly a classic .
427623	3079504	104812	10.0	Wonderfully Depressing	This is one of the best movies I've ever seen . . . . I never want to see it again . Why don't I want to see it ? Its simply depressing . I can't watch it with out becoming suicidal . This is the story of two ill fated lovers over the early and mid part of the 20th century . Its told in flashback in a fishing village in Canada . What can I say ? This is a film of great performances and moments , the firestorm in Dresden gives me nightmares . I would love to recommend the film , but its ultimately so bleak I don't know many people who would want to see it . Still I give it simply because it provokes such a deep reaction in me .
426998	3079504	102070	10.0	You will either groove on its knowing brand of low comic silliness or you'll hate it	Just sprung from prison Hudson Hawk finds himself being chased by an insane and insanely rich couple , the CIA and the Vatican in a mad chase to get bits of a gold making machine made by Da Vinci . Along the way stupid jokes are told , the plot is ignored or twisted in the name of a joke and the entire cast winks at the audience repeatedly as if to say that even they can't believe the silly things they are doing in the name of fun . When this movie opened it was crucified by critics across the country as an unfunny vanity project . It sunk the promising career of the director and made people take a second look at Bruce Willis . very few people braved the reviews and saw this in theaters . Me ? I'm one of the six people in America that went to see this on opening night . I've loved this movie from the first and my opinion has grown with each viewing . I remember arguing with people for weeks afterward that they should see this movie because it was damn funny . No one listened to me , and it wasn't until cable and home video that people discovered this wrongly dismissed gem . This is more proof that sometimes critics don't get it . Then again all humor is subjective and what one person finds funny is not what other people find funny . I love this knowingly dumb , puny , go for the obvious , nothing is sacred or too stupid to try collection of jokes and gags . Other people are offended or utterly bored by its often infantile antics . I find it charming and harmless , other people find it cruel ( Bunny Ball Ball ! ) . I can't say which camp you'll fall into , but I think that you should ignore the critics and just see this movie . Its mindless fun of the highest order .
427596	3079504	60073	10.0	Damning Documentary of Humanity	Sent to Africa to make the next Mondo Cane movie the film makers found themselves in the middle of several revolutions . What they would film would form the basis of a damning attack on everyone , both black and white , involved in the shift in power on the Dark Continent . I've watched the three versions of this film and I'm a fan of all of them . Interestingly the one I like the least is the original cut of the film which has several snide comments and re-dubbed voices that make the film truly rude and cruel for no good reason . The original cut goes out of its way to have a holier than thou view that is missing from both of the English cuts . The original cut also has several more minutes of animal cruelty that is completely uncalled for . This film ran into serious trouble upon its original release because charges were brought , though later found to be false , that the film makers had paid some of the soldiers to kill some one so that they could film it . ( this charge would form the basis for The Wild Eye , a fictional film about the making of a mondo movie made by another Mondo Cane director ) Considering all of the the death and destruction in this film I find it hard to believe that anyone would have had to have been paid to kill anyone . Yes , its a tough film , but it leaves no one with clean hands , even the film makers . See this film . It will make you think .
