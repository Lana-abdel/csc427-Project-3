498293	1355507	260162	1.0	By the time a character in The Mangler 2 says " useless piece of American garbage " you'll know exactly how he feels , absolutely awful film .	The Mangler 2 starts with a rebellious teenager named Jo Newton ( Chelse Swain ) being sent to a private school by her displeased billionaire Father ( Ken Camroux ) after breaking into one of his hi-tech computer lab thingy's & hacking the main computer , or something like that . Headmaster Bradeen ( Lance Henriksen ) holds a school assembly ( consisting of about 50 students ) to inform everyone that while they have been away on their spring break the school has been fitted out with the latest computer system called M2K from ' Newton Industries ' that will safeguard the students needs & safety . As it happens everyone is going away on a geography trip , everyone that is except the five head prefects , Jo , Dan Channa ( Will Sanderson ) , Corey Banks ( Miles Meadows ) , Will Walsh ( Dexter Bell ) & Emily Stone ( Daniella Evangelista ) who have to stay behind because of a practical joke played on the schools website which ' degrades ' the school & it's pupils . Bradeen specifically accuses Jo so as revenge she downloads a virus called the ' Mangler ' & infects the schools brand new computer systems with it . Before long Bob the maintenance man ( Jeff Doucette ) has been murdered by the schools computer as it decides to kill everyone currently within it's walls . . . Written & directed by Micheal Hamilton-Wright The Mangler 2 has no connection to the previous Tobe Hooper directed The Mangler ( 1995 ) & is truly one of the worse films you will ever have the opportunity to witness . It's absolutely abysmal on every conceivable level you care to think of . The script is so slow & boring it could probably put most people into a coma , Bob the maintenance man isn't killed until the 36 minute mark so that means there is 36 painful , dull , uneventful & frankly god awful minutes before anything that even approaches horror takes place . Up to this point it's just totally unnecessary chit chat & character development that instead of making the viewer care about these people does exactly the opposite , I hated every single annoying , unfunny spoilt brat in The Mangler 2 & it's been a while since I've hated every character in a film . I mean take Jo for instance , besides being a sort of anti-hero she is always in a mood but what has she got to be in a mood about exactly ? Her Father's a billionaire , life can't be that bad for her surely ! So you just sit there hoping they will be killed off in very painful ways , well you can forget about that as almost all of the murders , of which there aren't many anyway , are off-screen , incredibly dull & bland . There is no gore in The Mangler 2 just a burned guy & a few splashes of blood , really that's it , in fact there isn't an effect in The Mangler 2 that you couldn't create at home with a bit of fake blood . From a technical point of view it ain't bad but the direction sucks , director Hamilton-Wright fails miserably to create any tension , atmosphere , scares or anything that resembles entertainment . How can a computer control things which aren't electrical like a washing machine lid or a wheelchair ? How can it makes wires come alive & wrap themselves around people ? How was this film ever allowed to get past the script stage ( if there was a script ) ? Why are the characters so dumb ? Why don't they just stand out in the open where there are no electrical appliances ? Why do they split up & constantly argue ? Why don't they just walk out of the door instead of having to run across the roof ? Why has no one got a mobile phone ? Doesn't everyone have mobile phones these days ? The unbelievably mushy ending when the annoying character who started it all in the first place finds a new found appreciation for her Father & they both live happily ever after just compounds the fact that I wanted to slit my wrists after suffering 90 odd minutes of this crap , Micheal Hamilton-Wright bow your head in shame ! A quick word about the acting , first everyone's terrible & really unlikable . Second , oh dear what on Earth was Lance Henriksen thinking ? ! This piece of straight-to-video , or maybe it was made-for-video ? , turgid rubbish really blots his copybook as far as I'm concerned . A special mention goes to the highly irritating & annoying techno music that director Hamilton-Wright insists on abusing our ears with . According to the IMDb The Mangler 2 had an estimated budget of $4 , 000 , 000 , all I can say is that where did the money go because it's a cheap looking film with few effects & actor's . Currently almost 70 % of the votes on the IMDb give it 1 star which it fully deserves & I honestly can't see what anyone would get out of The Mangler 2 in terms of entertainment . Apparently there is a yet another sequel called The Mangler Reborn ( 2005 ) at which I shudder at the mere thought . There really is nothing that I can compliment The Mangler 2 on , it is one of the very worst films it's been my misfortune to endure & generally speaking it is just an astonishingly bad film that I hope you never have to sit through & if you already have then I feel your pain . . .
497657	1355507	74434	1.0	Awful horror film , the sort of film the fast forward button was invented for .	This film opens with the on screen caption " on August 10th in a California Drive-In it all began . . . " A young couple are murdered while sitting in their car at a drive-in watching a film , by an unknown psycho with a large oriental sword . Two fat cops Mike and John ( James Barnes and Micheal Alden ) are put on the case , but unfortunately when it comes to solving the crime and capturing the killer these guys are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard . They interrogate a few people connected with the drive-in , Germy ( Douglas Gudbye ) the all round dogsbody , and Atkin Johnson ( Newton Naushaus ) the hilariously bad tempered and foul mouthed manager . This leads to a funny conversation between the two cops and Atkins , Atkins says teenagers are dicks and one of the cops replies " well , I have two of them " referring to the two dead kids from the opening sequence , the other cop quickly buts in and says " teenagers that is ! " , funny stuff and it doesn't end there . The cops helpfully observe " well , she's in pretty bad shape , she was murdered with a sword " and when they want to talk with Atkins again one says " lets go get that bald headed garbage can ! " Anyway , they are baffled , the only lead they have is a man named Orville ( Norman Sherlock ) who hangs around the drive-in and spy's on people in their cars having sex , but when questioned by the two cops he claims he had nothing to do with the killings and he says " I just wanted to beat my meat ! " , hey that's what the guy said . All their leads come to dead ends . Will the two cops be able to unmask the killer in time , before more innocent lives are lost ? Co-written , produced and directed by Stuart Segall this is just plain terrible . The acting is awful as is the photography and music . There are a couple of good gore scenes , a decapitation , a slit throat and an impaling , there just should have been more of them . But that's nowhere near a good enough reason to sit through this rubbish . The script by George ' Buck ' Flowers and John F . Goff is slow , dull , boring and predictable . There's a scene where the two fat cops stakeout the drive-in , in disguise . One of them dresses in drag , he looks ridiculous and then they start to have a stupid conversation about where he's going to pee ! There is also another scene where two victims are watching an unknown film in their car , the guy says " what a turkey ! " and " this plots been done before " , you will know exactly how he feels , I also wondered if his dialogue was included by the filmmakers as a little self referring joke , it sums up the film well . Half the film appears to be padding , there's a five minute sequence in which Germy walks around a funfair for absolutely no reason whatsoever , among other pointlessly drawn out scenes . The ending is also one of the worst ever , nothing is concluded . One to avoid . This does have a great tag line on the video cover though , ' You'll pay to get in . . . and pray to get out ! ! ' , that's true enough , you'll pray to get out alright , just way before this thing finishes .
497741	1355507	884237	1.0	Absolutely dreadful pseudo computer game masquerading as a horror film .	Carnivorous starts as Kate ( Leah Rose ) gets a flat tyre while driving in some isolated woods somewhere , soon after a guy ( Chris Flieller ) comes along in a truck & abducts her after knocking her out with a shovel . Kate wakes up to find herself tapped inside what looks like a huge labyrinth that is populated by awful computer game graphics , sorry I mean scary ten foot tall monsters . Along with various other people Kate has to survive the various traps , dodge the monsters & try to find a way out of the maze like labyrinth & to the safety of the real world . . . Written & directed by Drew Maxwell I watched Carnivorous last night , I actually had the choice of watching this , Southern Comfort ( 1981 ) , Kiss the Girls ( 1997 ) or Saw II ( 2005 ) & I definitely made the wrong decision since Carnivorous is one of the worst films it's been my displeasure to endure . At the time of writing this comment Carnivorous has a lowly User Rating of 1 . 8 on the IMDb & I am wondering why so high ? Also at the time of writing this comment there is only one other User Comment & it starts by asking the question ' Why such a low IMDb rating ? ' , well it has such a low rating because it's truly dreadful . It's abysmal . It's appalling in every aspect . It's an awful film , if you can describe it as a film , & it's as simple & straight forward as that really . I have no connection to the film industry , I had never heard of Carnivorous before I watched it , I don't know anyone involved with the film & the director & producer & actor's are just ' names ' to me & I didn't see it at some obscure film festival with an introduction by the director which is all it takes for some people to rave about the biggest pieces of celluloid crap imaginable . I am just an average guy & I cannot understand or see how anyone could find anything in Carnivorous even in the remotest bit enjoyable or entertaining . Both conceptually & technically Carnivorous is appalling . The story is weak , the character development is none existent , the plot makes no sense , there's barely any exposition , it's impossible to care about what is going on & it's unrelentingly dull & boring to boot . Definitely one to avoid . A lot of Carnivorous was shot in a warehouse against a green-screen & the backgrounds & monsters were digitally put in later & the process looks terrible . The perspective is all wrong , character's just don't look right or stand right against the poorly rendered & detailed backgrounds which look awful . It's so dark you can barely see anything , the lighting is all wrong on character's face's & bodies , the CGI monster look terrible & the average PS3 console game looks better with more convincing graphics . Carnivorous is like a poorly made video game but without the fun of the interaction , you just sit there looking at these awful CGI graphics & praying that it's going to finish sooner rather than later . The film has a really odd look & feel , your brain just know's that something is wrong , that something isn't quite right in the way character's walk around or the perspective of certain shots & it's a very odd viewing experience . There's not much gore either , there's a decapitated , an impaling & a cut head but nothing else & all the actor's obviously were working without any on set props & these scenes just don't work as the CGI animators try to match the live action & the CGI but pretty much fail on every occasion . I have never seen another film quite like Carnivorous & I genuinely hope it's a one off & filmmakers don't go down the cheap CGI route not only for backgrounds but sets & props as well . According to the IMDb this had a supposed budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 , yeah right ! Knock at least three zeros off that & I think that would be nearer the true budget . The film has no scares , the lighting is well off , the CGI backgrounds are far too dark & look terrible & the whole film seems to try & go far a Hellbound : Hellraiser II ( 1988 ) feel with it's Gothic style hellish labyrinth complete with dangling hooks on chains but the CGI is awful . The acting is terrible too from no-one I have ever heard of . Carnivorous is a truly terrible film , it's absolutely dreadful & deserves it's lowly IMDb rating . This is definitely ' worst film ever ' material & I would hate to think the techniques used here to make Carnivorous would become widespread in the industry . One of the worst films I have ever endured & I have endured some real rubbish over the years .
499149	1355507	346811	1.0	" We just landed on monster island . " Awful , awful , awful , avoid at all costs .	The Curse of the Komodo starts on an isolated island near Hawaii as an army special forces operation is secretly taking place which ends up with them all being killed by a huge genetically engineered Komodo . The army have gotten cold feet over the experiment & orders the project leader Professor Nathan Phipps ( William Langlois ) & his assistant Dr . Dawn Porter ( Gail Harris ) back to the island to destroy all evidence of the experiment that was designed to produce huge genetic mutations to used as weapons against the enemy . . . Meanwhile thieves Drake ( Paul Logan ) , Tiffany ( Melissa Brasselle ) & Reece ( Cam Newlim ) make good their escape in a chopper after robbing a casino but they run into bad weather & their pilot Jack ( Tim Abell ) has to land anywhere he can & in one of the film only type coincidences they land on Komodo island . They meet up with Phipps his daughter Rebecca ( Glori-Anne Gilbert ) & Porter who are protected by armed guards Jason ( Jay Richardson ) , Hanson ( Ted Monte ) & Blake ( J . P . Davis ) . Things quickly spiral out of control as the huge Komodo begins to systematically eat everyone in sight , will any of them survive ? Directed by Jim Wynorski as Jay Andrews The Curse of the Komodo is one awful creature feature & just a downright terrible film . The script by Steve Latshaw is predictably rubbish , the rules for this type of film aren't hard to follow are they ? You have your isolated location & stranded monster food , there's the giant dinosaur , genetically engineered creature or alien or whatever to eat the cast members one-by-one & the corrupt military involvement to introduce lots of guns & weaponry , simple right ? Well not to Mr . Latshaw & Wynorski as The Curse of the Komodo fails in every department , there isn't one positive thing I can say about this film . The character's are boring cardboard stereotypical clichés the least about whom the better . The Komodo barely does anything & why did the military create giant Komodo lizards in the first place ? Maybe they could have genetically engineered a huge hamster or something docile & cuddly , it would have been easier to control if anything went wrong , right ? The film is really slow , dull & very boring as it's over forty minutes before the Komodo even shows up ( not counting the opening sequence ) . The attack scenes are dull , unexciting & repetitive as the giant Komodo just stands there as our cast of humans just shoot at it for what seems like ages as their guns never run out of ammo . I have an intense dislike for films like The Curse of the Komodo , it's boring , poorly written & it's a film of absolutely no redeeming qualities . If the military had no conscience about napalming the island why didn't they do that to start with instead of sending in two scientists ? It would have saved a lot of time , trouble & pain for everyone involved especially us the poor viewer having to sit through this crap ! Director Wynorski has made over sixty of these low budget horror / sci-fi films & to be fair he knows how to make a film , unfortunately he doesn't know how to make a good film . The special effects are terrible , the plotting is awful , the logic is absurd , it rips off various other films & as a whole The Curse of the Komodo is seriously crap . Forget about any sort of gore or violence , the Komodo only eats one person on screen & even then just to their legs . Technically the film isn't too bad but it's all rather bland & forgettable . The acting is pretty bad & I didn't think the women were good looking enough either , Anne Gilbert gets her breasts out but that's about it . The Curse of the Komodo is total rubbish , it provides no entertainment value whatsoever & there are far better creature feature films out there . This is not a sequel to & has nothing to do with the film Komodo ( 1999 ) which is far better than this . According to the IMDb Komodo Vs . Cobra ( 2005 ) directed by Wynorski is in post-production , I shudder at the mere thought of it .
496841	1355507	447604	1.0	Terrible no budget horror thriller crap .	At Dawn They Sleep tells the tale of two drug dealing friends , Stephen ( editor , cinematographer , writer , producer , director , etc , Brian Paulin ) & Ian ( producer , cinematographer , etc , Rich George ) who get bitten by two angels who they decide to sleep with . Unfortunately the bite of an angel turns the victim into a Vampire so Stephen & Ian are left to contemplate their future as blood drinking Vampires who deal in drugs . Actually not that much else happens really . . . Virtually made by himself & starring Brian Paulin I thought At Dawn They Sleep was total complete & utter crap , I'm sorry but it's as simple & straight forward as that . The script is rubbish , the story is so thin it's beyond anorexic , it's incredibly boring , it's dull & it's just a real chore to sit through . The character's are awful & you just instantly hate them all , the dialogue is terrible & as a whole it doesn't make much sense . The angel thing just doesn't work & the mixing of horror & crime thriller just doesn't come off to any effect . I'm trying but I cannot think of one positive aspect to this crappy film , I really can't . What more can I say ? Director Paulin was obviously working on a low budget & I'm sure the filmmakers put lots of effort into it & tried their best but that just isn't enough , I mean if the films crap it's crap right ? We're the ones who have to pay good money to sit down & watch this crap so why choose this piece of rubbish over a decent Vampire film ? The film was shot on a camcorder & it looks awful , there's no scares or atmosphere & the ' action ' scenes are as unexciting as any ever committed to film , sorry I meant video . There are a few gory scenes here , there are some intestine's ripped out , a decapitated head , some neck biting , a knife suck in someones head , various bloody gunshot wounds & a fair amount of fake blood splashed around but it looks pretty fake . There is also a baffling end sequence where someone slices a tree with a samurai sword & some liquid oozes out while some naked bird writhes around on the ground being fondled by the trees leaves & branches ( The Evil Dead ( 1982 ) anyone ? ) just before it starts to ' rain ' blood , I have no idea why though . With a supposed budget of about $6 , 000 this is really low budget stuff , I still cannot accept that as an excuse for making such a terrible film though . This is also one of those films with an extremely annoying soundtrack that at times seems louder than the dialogue & as a result drowns it out making it hard to hear what's being said . The acting is poor & the main lead ( Mr Paulin himself ) looks like a ginger haired Meatloaf . At Dawn They Sleep is awful , I'm sorry but that's the way I feel about it & the fact that it's an Indie film just doesn't cut the mustard with me & it's not an excuse as far s I'm concerned . I've had more fun visiting the dentist , not recommended .
497021	1355507	681845	1.0	" I am not a laboratory rat ! " The worst episode of Quincy ever .	Quincy M . E . : The Cutting Edge starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & crime scene photographer Ed ( Eddie Garrett ) are helping out after an accident at a pipe yard , they find six injured men including fork lift truck driver Kenny Kelso ( Paul Rudd ) who has lost an arm . Quincy stabilises Kenny & lets the paramedics take over , they take Kenny & his severed arm to Las Manos Medical Center where Dr . Gabriel McCracken ( Barry Newman ) runs a program called Experiment Hope in which the finest doctor's & specialists all work together on new techniques & try to find solutions to seemingly hopeless cases like Kenny & his severed arm . . . Episode 24 from season 8 The Cutting Edge was the very last episode of Quincy , after eight seasons & 148 episodes Quincy was no more . You know generally speaking I really like Quincy as a show , with it's murder mysteries & varied range of story lines so when the show was good I loved it but especially towards the end of it's run when it was bad boy it was absolutely awful ! The Cutting Edge is probably the single worst episode of Quincy I can remember seeing , I almost feel like a traitor calling it awful but that's honestly the way I felt about it & since it was the very last episode one would have thought Quincy & the regular supporting cast would have had a decent send off but no apart from Quincy appearing in the opening sequence to attend the accident scene , going to visit Dr . McCracken for a couple of minutes about twenty minutes in & a further two or three minutes at the very end he's barely in it while none of the regular support cast are in at all , not Sam , not Asten , not Danny or Lt . Monahan or Brill . Unbelievable , I actually thought I was watching McCracken M . D . rather than Quincy M . E . ! I didn't know while watching it but I've since learned that this was actually a pilot for a planned series called The Cutting Edge with Barry Newman as McCracken tackling serious medical issues , or that's probably how it would have played but luckily the series never got made . You can see that McCracken is given lots of background as his family troubles are pointed out as is his relationship with the hospital administrator as well as several other colleagues who are also all fleshed out more than one would expect from a single one off 50 minutes Quincy episode . A real wasted opportunity to give Quincy a great final episode & a good farewell . The basic story isn't even any good , there's no murder , there's no mystery , there's no laboratory work at all & it's just a terrible piece of drama that doesn't deserve to be called Quincy . While watching The Cutting edge I was becoming increasingly concerned about Kenny Kelso , KK to his mates , I mean he started the day off minding his own business going about his job only to have a stack of large metal piping collapse on top of him severing his arm , then he has to undergo hours in the operating theatre undergoing surgery to reattach it , then he almost dies from a subdural haematoma for which the doctor's have to revive him & then bore a hole in his skull with a drill to drain the excess blood & if that wasn't enough he loses the ability to use his one remaining good arm all in a day ! Wow , talk about bad luck . I bet KK wishes he had just stayed in bed that morning . The Cutting Edge is the single worst Quincy episode ever , in fact I'd struggle to even call it a Quincy episode since he's only in for about five minutes & doesn't do anything . It's even more of a shame since it was the very last Quincy episode so no-one got a proper send off & you know what , I just hated it , the story , the character's & everything about it & I'm glad they never made the proposed series . Anyway , one final thought from me , goodbye Quincy & thanks for all the great episodes & it's unfortunate The Cutting Edge wasn't one of them .
497412	1355507	366518	1.0	Terrible purely because of the awful twist ending .	Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon ( associate producer Joe Morton ) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education , fail & they will never become qualified Doctors . A bright , young , attractive & intelligent student named Eve ( Kelly Overton ) is given a particularly difficult patient to study . His name is Don Wake ( James Haven ) & is a convicted killer , he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman ( Diane Verona ) & her young daughter ( Jenette McCurdy ) . At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her , but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out . Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve , he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay . Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn , as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred . Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient . . . ? Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn . Now , we all like a good twist ending , the sort of ending which catches us unawares , surprises us , works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) & Fight Club ( 1999 ) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream ( 1996 ) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious . Then , of course , there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take , oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film , never . Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve , it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest , it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that bad a film until the twist ending , I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point ( which was OK to be fair to it ) suddenly becomes irrelevant . I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail , all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will . Breaking Dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history , it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller , maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot . He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day . Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout . The acting is pretty good , Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance . Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse ( 1980 ) , City of the Living Dead ( 1980 ) , The House on the Edge of the Park ( 1980 ) , Cannibal Ferox ( 1981 ) , Stagefright ( 1987 ) & The Church ( 1989 ) ? OK , maybe it was just me . . . Breaking Dawn is rubbish , I hated it all because of the final few minutes . Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK . Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb . . .
497121	1355507	79074	1.0	" OK , OK as far as I'm concerned you can eat sht . " Dracula Sucks sucks .	Dracula Sucks starts with the arrival of Richard Renfield ( Richard Bulik ) & his Aunt Irene ( Patricia Manning ) at a sanatorium owned & run by Dr . Arthur Seward ( John Leslie ) & his sister Dr . Sybil Seward ( Kay Parker ) . It appears that Renfield has been suffering from nightmares & sleepless nights so his Aunt has asked the Seward's for help . That night Renfield hears voices which lead him to a nearby Abbey where Count Dracula ( Jamie Gillis ) bites him & turns him into his servant . The next day Dr . Seward's friend Dr . Van Helsing ( Reggie Nalder as Detlef van Berg ) arrives at the sanatorium to assist him in his research . It's not long before Dracula has sunk his fangs into a woman named Lucy Webster ( Serena ) who happens to be a friend of Dracula's ultimate prize Mina ( Annette Haven ) who Dracula wants to be his bride by mixing his semen with her blood , but not if Mina's fiancé Jonathan Harker ( Paul Thomas ) has anything to do with it . . . Co-written & directed by Phillip Marshak Dracula Sucks , quite simply , sucks . At this point I should say that I am aware there are two distinct versions available both soft-core & hardcore variants , I will be commenting on the soft-core version called Dracula Sucks that ran for just over 87 minutes & not the hardcore version which is apparently known as Dracula's Bride . The script by Marshak & Daryl Marshak ( Brother's maybe ? ) tries to mix sex & horror with the odd snippet of comedy but unfortunately with little success , no I'll rephrase that , with no success whatsoever . As Dracula Sucks tires to please both those viewers looking for horror & those looking for sex it fails to please either , the film is really slow & a bit of a chore to sit through . The character's are rubbish & just naming them Dracula , Van Helsing & Harker doesn't mean you automatically have a Dracula film . I pretty much hate this film , it has no horror elements apart from a few shots in Dracula's cobweb strewn tomb & a few lame Vampire attacks . The sex is also disappointing with them few & far between & in this version only last for a couple of minutes each if that & you certainly won't be able to masturbate over anything in this unless your really quick . . . Dracula Sucks includes an unnecessary , unpleasant & gratuitous rape , a bit of incest & a scene where a man has sex with a female Vampire while she is still supposedly asleep . As far as blood & gore goes there is one stake through the heart , a couple of Vampire bites including Count Dracula himself biting naked breasts but it's far less exciting & exploitative than it sounds . Dracula Sucks also attempts to be funny on occasion with some awful one-liner type dialogue driven jokes , it's a pretty safe bet no one will be rolling around on the floor in a fit of laughter . The entire film takes place in a castle of some sort & the surroundings look OK but overall Dracula Sucks is as cheap & nasty as it's pornography roots would suggest . The cinematography is bland , the music forgettable & the direction non-existent . The acting is also awful & Gillis is surely one of the worst on screen Dracula's ever . Personally I don't particularly like pornography anyway & when it turns a cinematic legend like Dracula into a cheap , worthless piece of crap such as this I can't recommend it at all to those looking for either horror or sex . I would imagine the hardcore version provides more in the way of sexual fulfilment but since I haven't seen that & this soft-core version is probably much more widely available I would have to say to any potential viewer to seriously think twice before wasting your time & money on this . Either go for a proper porno or a proper horror & not some messed up patchwork attempt at both but succeeds at neither .

Frank on the version I saw La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes has to be one of the very worst horror films I've ever had the misfortune to sit through & I have seen some real stinkers in my time . The script by god knows who as A . L . Mariaux on my copy is absolutely terrible . La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes is quite simply one of the most boring films I've seen , I can't stress enough just how dull this pathetic attempt at a film is . The characters are none existent , the film features little in the way of dialogue & nothing in terms of development . The dialogue that is present sounds like it was written by a five year old , it's some of the most basic tripe I've heard . I think La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes was written on the back of a postage stamp by a trained pigeon . While watching this lump of dung of elephant sized proportions I kept looking at my DVD timing counter & praying that it was almost finished , at only 82 minutes long La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes actually seemed liked it went on for hours . The script has no logic , it clearly states that the zombies rise during the night & that at dawn they disappear right ? Well in that case how come the two women during the opening sequence were killed in the day ? When Blabert tells Kurt the location of the gold how does Kurt know he's telling the truth ? Kurt is very quick to kill him but what if he had been lying ? Why didn't Blabert go & find the gold for himself ? 6 million in gold sounds very tempting to me . I could go on forever with it's many problems but I really can't be bothered . Technically La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes is awful , Franco shoots most of the climatic zombies vs . stupid annoying teenage kids battle using day-for-night which has the ( presumeably ) unwanted effect of the brightness levels of things going up , down & all over the place & one more thing Jesus there are no shadows cast at night because that takes the sun if you believe the laws of physics anyway . A special mention for the cinematography as well which is basic , very jerky & full of cheap stuttering zooms . The zombies look terrible , Franco even resorts to having a skull with one eye on a stick bobbing up & down in front of the camera . The attacks lack any gore , excitement , atmosphere or threat . These zombies are seriously lame & are a disgrace to money paying filmgoing audiences all over the world ! As one would expect the dubbing is atrocious , even worse than the usual Euro horror dub if that's possible . How much can one person hate a film ? Given La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes just ate 82 minutes of my life up nowhere near enough I'd say . La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes is so bad I'd walk out on it on an aeroplane . . .
498968	1355507	91142	2.0	Absolutely terrible film which makes no sense whatever anyone says .	Gothic is set in Geneva at the Villa Deodati where English poet Lord Byron ( Gabriel Byrne ) lives in a self imposed exile . Percy Shelley ( Julian Sands ) his lover Mary Godwin ( Miranda Richardson ) & her sister Claire ( Myriam Cyr ) all turn up wanting to spend some quality time with Byron & have some fun , Byron invites everyone in & says they are welcome . Over the course of that very night lots of strange things happen which I'm at a loss to explain & the film itself doesn't do a very good job either . . . This British production was directed by Ken Russell & is a film which almost defies logical explanation or any reasonable critique of it , I don't know what Kenneth was on when he made this but it must have been strong stuff & it's no wonder he's been relegated to appearing on Celebrity Big Brother & making home films which no-ones ever seen . The script by Stephen Volk which takes itself extremely seriously is a strange beast to say the least although one has to bear in mind that what ended up on screen maybe isn't what he actually wrote as many things can happen between writing a script & the finished product , if this finished version was representative of his script though one has to wonder how this piece of crap ever got financed & who did he think this mess of a film was going to appeal to ? Certainly not your average horror film fan that's for sure . The basic plot about the the events which lead up to Mary writing Frankenstein & Byron's doctor John Polidori ( Timothy Spall ) to write The Vampire could have been decent but it's totally lost under loads of pretentious art-house visuals which are far from impressive . As a whole Gothic is bizarre , weird & just totally out there unfortunately it's also pointless , boring , crap , rubbish , meaningless , empty , unsatisfying & what really kills it is that it provides zero entertainment value , yes it really is that bad . It's not even historically accurate , did you know it was actually Byron who visited Shelley & not the other way round as Gothic would have you believe ? Well now you do . I pretty much hated this film from start to finish . Director Russell is in total over-the-top mode here with some strange imagery , unfortunately it's not very striking & it just all comes off a weird & pointless . The whole film is quite abstract & surreal , in fact it's maybe the Salvador Dali of horror films ! Just when you think it's settling down into some sort of proper story as Claire admits that she's pregnant with Byron's child or when they hold a séance around an old skull it goes nowhere & ends back up with some more strange scenes which makes no sense . Although the visuals are strange & weird I don't think they are particularly stylishly filmed or constructed which doesn't help . The film as a whole is quite tame , the nudity isn't excessive & there's no gore or violence to speak of . Technically the film is alright , the location used was Gaddesdon Place in Hamel Hampstead in Hertfordshire which is in good old England & the house in the film just feels very empty & basic although it's obviously of the right period & looks the business . It's generally well made with decent production values throughout . This has a good cast with Byrne , Richardson , Spall & Sands but they ham it up & put in pretty bad overwrought performances . Gothic is a film which I personally hated , I'm positive it has some fans out there but most film-goers will find it an absolute mess . In fact I'd struggle to even call it a proper film it's that bad , who in their right mind actually green lit this piece of crap & how did Kenneth manage to convince anyone to finance it ?
497550	1355507	293961	2.0	Absolutely terrible .	The Trip starts as eight college friends begin a trip from Los Angeles to Arizona for reasons which aren't important , up front in the sports car it's Carl ( Larry Bagby ) & his girlfriend Devan ( Courtney Cole ) along with Garry ( Michael Chamberlain ) & his stash of ecstasy that they plan on selling , then in the off roader it's Devan's sister Cess ( Heather Shrake ) along with Dana ( Elizabeth Keller ) & Darius ( David Slocum ) while in the piece of crap run down car it's Sylvia & Veronica ( Cristal Gerrick ) . The three cars travel across the long winding roads & encounter a dirty blue truck which Carl gets involved in a road rage incident with which turns out to be a bad idea since the driver of the truck then decides to go after the friends & kill them one-by-one . . . Written , produced & directed by Mark Cross this is another rubbishy zero budget independent horror themed piece of nonsense that really is no fun to watch at all . The script takes itself extremely seriously & is a complete total & utter bore from start to finish , virtually nothing happens that could even begin to pass as entertaining & to me by the last 20 odd minutes The Trip felt like it was nothing much more than scenes of cars driving along edited together between a few dull than dull conversation's amongst some very annoying teenage character's . There is a bit of a story here & it all ends with an absolutely horrible sentimental message which you feel is close to the director's heart in the way it comes across . The story itself is thin , it makes little sense , there's no real explanation to anything that's going on , there are more than a few holes in it & the twists are extremely obvious & predictable in a ' I worked out that was going to happen 20 minutes ago ' sort of way . Then there's the fact The Trip is incredibly boring & slow , there are huge chunks of this film where virtually nothing happens & it nearly put me to sleep on several occasions . Director Cross can't write a good horror film but he has some technical competence & The Trip is reasonably well made , I'd have said it was well made if not for the fact the colours are very muted & during the night scenes you can barely see anything . The Trip isn't scary in the slightest , it has zero tension or atmosphere & it hasn't a single drop of blood in the film as people are run over in very unspectacular ways . The budget was obviously low on The Trip , the so-called action scenes between the various cars lack any excitement or pace & they can't even afford to show anyone actually run over as it's mostly hint's & suggestions . The acting is generally on the wrong side of average . The Trip seems to be quite an obscure film & to be honest you should be thankful that it is & hope that it stays that way . Zero scares , zero gore , zero excitement , zero sense & zero entertainment .
497377	1355507	465616	2.0	Badly written , badly lit low budget horror comedy .	Stagknight is set in England where Brian ( Simeon Willis ) has been taken on a stag weekend by nine of his mates , an isolated cottage deep in the countryside for a paint-balling competition . However the owner of the cottage has other plans for them as she makes them chant an ancient spell ( don't ask ) which unleashes some some of Knights Templar demon known as a Guardian who protects a magical cauldron ( or something like that ) by killing everyone . As the paint-ballers numbers begin to fall rapidly the survivors must find a way to send the Guardian back to hell for good . . . This English production was co-written , co-produced & directed by Simon Cathcart who also played Sean & one has to say Stagknight is as bad as it sounds . The script by Cathcart & Robert Mercer tries to be funny & scary but fails miserably on both counts , the horror comedy genre is very difficult to pull off as there is a very fine line between being funny & just plain stupid & being scary & being anything but . There wasn't one single scene in Stagknight which I thought was funny , jokes revolving around people sat on toilets farting a lot or Asain character's speaking in funny accents or an old woman giving a guy a blow job or a character falling down a large hole & then someone else ' accidently ' dislodges a brick which drops on them or someone removing a dildo from his anus complete with a loud popping sound effect just scrape the bottom of the proverbial barrel as far as humour goes . The horror elements are no better , this large Knight dude show's up every so often & kills a few people but apart from that there's nothing here we haven't seen a million times before . This is just your average teen slasher with comedy character's who irritate rather than entertain . There's barely any gore , the kills are unimaginative & the story about ghostly Guardians & some rubbish about a magical cauldron just sucks . Director Cathcart has to be blamed for a lot of what I saw , besides the script being generic uninspiring crap it's so badly shot it's untrue . The version I saw was so dark in places there were times when the screen was virtually black & I didn't have a clue what I supposed to be seeing . The worst lit film since the notorious Humongous ( 1982 ) . The gore is virtually none existent , someone gets an axe in their chest , there's a bit of blood splatter , there's a decapitated head & someone is impaled on a spear . I don't think there's any nudity either , I can't remember any anyway . It's not scary or atmospheric & since it's so bloody dark & badly lit it becomes incredibly frustrating & annoying to watch . According to the IMDb Stagknight supposedly had a budget of about £1 , 500 , 000 which surprises me since it's a very badly made film with barely any CGI effects , no gore effects & no name actors . It's set entirely within some woods & I really can't see where all the money went . Also according to the IMDb Stagknight was shot in 2005 & presumably sat on the shelf for a few years which is no surprise since it's so bad . In fact I'm surprised this didn't go straight to the Sc-Fi Channel . The acting is nothing to shout about & the thick English accents are annoying . Stagknight is a poor moronic horror comedy slasher film that isn't funny or scary or gory & it's so badly lit half the time you can't see whats happening . Definitely not recommended .
498741	1355507	681883	2.0	More rubbishy outdated moral issues raised in the most boring way .	Quincy M . E . : Women of Valor starts as unlicensed midwife Olivia Allen ( Lynn Hamilton ) is approached in the street by a woman who begs her to help deliver her friends baby , against her better judgement Olivia agrees but there are complications & the baby suffers from breathing problems . Olivia takes the baby to Charrington Hospital but dies while Doctor's try to revive it , since Olivia is unlicensed & has no medical training the D . A . decides to go ahead with a murder charge on the assumption that if the baby had been delivered in a hospital it would still be alive . Meanwhile a woman is transfered from Charrington while in labour but the baby dies in the ambulance en-route , concerned about the issues she is witnessing Dr . Katherine Reed ( Elizabeth Huddle ) ask's the county coroner's office for independent help , Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) puts his best man Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) on the case . . . Episode 20 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & I have to say Women of Valor is rubbish & coming straight after the brilliant Murder on Ice ( 1983 ) it is even more of a disappointment . I personally like the Quincy episodes where he has to solve or prove a crime using his detective skills & medical expertise & conversely I hate the episodes where Quincy barely features & the entire show is hijacked by some awful , dull , irrelevant & outdated moral issue . Here the script tries to argue the case for midwives in California , unfortunately here in the UK we have always had midwives so the basic message is totally lost & irrelevant over here as well as many countries around the world . Add that to the fact that times have changed in America too & I would suggest Women of Valor is one of the most redundant , pointless & when viewed today meaningless Quincy episodes ever & believe me it's up against some strong competition especially during the generally awful season eight . Quincy is barely in it & Women of Valor focuses on the character of Dr . Katherine Reed & her troubles as her association with Olivia causes her all sorts of problems , cue lots of boring personal drama of the dullest kind . There's not much to comment on Women of Valor , it's bland & shot in a pretty dull way . Strangely this one doesn't feature Quincy's wife Emily at all despite being the episode after they get back from their ill fated honeymoon featured in Murder on Ice . The acting is alright but I really hate the way Quincy is getting less & less screen time , almost like he is being forced out . Women of Valor is rubbish , when it's good I love Quincy as a show but I'm not blind to it's bad episodes of which there are a fair few especially during season eight & when it's bad damn is it bad ! Disappointing in all aspects .
498222	1355507	479202	2.0	More low budget independent crap that's not worth a second of your time .	Urban Nightmare starts as Voodoo Dogs gang leader Terence Smith ( Walt Slowe ) discovers his Grandmother dead , she had been in the middle of a Voodoo ceremony & the caring kid that Terence is he decides to steal her book of magic & use it for himself . . . Detective Mike Rogers ( writer & director Tom Breedlove ) is investigating the so-called strip club robberies in which strip clubs are robbed , obviously . However these thieves leave behind lots of dead bodies as well , along with Satanic pentagrams written with their victims blood at the scene . Terence & his gang , Shenessa Grant ( Amy Mitchell ) , Keesha James ( Regenia Michelle ) , Tyrone White ( Abraham Spigner ) & Jerome Whales ( Kevin Lamont ) are responsible for the crimes & Detective Rogers gets lucky with a lead & knows they are but can't prove it , yet . At the scene of their latest robbery the Voodoo gang brutally murder a stripper named Kathy Ann Rider ( Kerry White ) in from of her fiancé Officer Johnny Ray Crane ( Richard " Rummy " Rumfelt ) & he swears vengeance which at first seems unlikely when Terence cuts his head off in another gruesome Satanic ritual but the demon he was offering the sacrifice to isn't pleased & brings Officer Crane back from the dead & it's now just whether Crane will catch up with the Voodoo Dogs first or Detective Rogers , either way they're in big trouble . . . Written , directed & starring Tom Breedlove Urban Nightmare is just another minuscule budget piece of horror crap that has virtually zero entertainment value . The script annoys , the basic idea is pretty sound but nothing is done with it as the exploitation elements are severely lacking , it's boring & has to feature some of the most irritating character's & dialogue ever . The dialogue is awful & simply having your black character's say ' Mother F % ^ % $ ' as many times as you can is lazy , insulting , offencive , unnecessary , stereotypical , extremely repetitive & bordering on racist , in fact by the end of the film I could virtually guess what they were about to say & on at least three occasions I got it exactly right , just think of the most simplistic dialogue you can & add a few swear words in strategic places . The whole thing is stupid , makes little sense & is a real chore to sit through at 90 odd minutes ( not 120 as the IMDb states , thank god ) . The demon & sacrificial aspects of the story are both vague & tenuous to say the least while peoples motivations are totally incomprehensible . Also while I will suspend my disbelief for few seconds & buy the assumption that someone could staple their head back onto their neck stump with an office stapler I refuse to accept that it would rejoin your neck muscles so you could move your head again , it just wouldn't . Then again maybe I'm thinking about this more than I should & more than the scriptwriter did , in fact I know I am . . . Director Breedlove does an OK job considering that the budget for this must have been small to say the least , it's actually a reasonable looking film although there are plenty of day-for-night shots towards the end as it's supposedly nighttime & dark but no-one seems to driving with their headlights on ! There's no scares , shocks , excitement , exploitation , atmosphere or anything else that might have saved Urban Nightmare from being the useless piece of cinematic crap that it undoubtedly is . Forget about any decent gore , there's a decapitated head , a neck wound , someone has their heart pulled out & their are some gunshot wounds plus a mouse is pulled in half at the start . With an estimated budget of about $100 , 000 this is poverty row stuff all the way . Don't expect to be impressed because you will be disappointed . The acting was poor & why do these black guys swear so much ? Is that really the sort of image that they want to portray ? Urban Nightmare is a pretty poor attempt at a horror film , there really isn't anything positive I can say about it I'm afraid . One to avoid .
498339	1355507	431114	3.0	More straight-to-video shot in Bulgaria action film junk from Seagal .	Today You Die starts as honourable criminal Harlan banks ( producer Steven Seagal ) is hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens ( Kevin Tighe ) to drive a security vehicle with $20 , 000 , 000 of cash in the back from point ' A ' a Las Vegas casino to point ' B ' him , sounds simple right ? Well what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery . Bummer . Things get even worse for Harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time , however Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20 , 000 , 000 at stake & unaccounted for Harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do Government agents . Harlan teams up with Ice Kool ( ! ) ( Anthony ' Teach ' Criss ) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point Harlan goes looking for some revenge . . . Photographed & directed by Don E . FauntLeRoy one has to say that the shot in Eastern Europe straight-to-video action films that Steven Seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & Today You Die is a good case in point . This is a terrible film , simple as that really . The script by producer Danny Lerner , Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around , that of a criminal rather than some Government agent / cop / soldier / one man army cliché he usually plays . In fact if you were being charitable you could say Today You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback ( 1998 ) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect . While Payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller Today You Die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison . Unfortunately here Seagal is terrible , he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not . For instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day Robin Hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor ( as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself ) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has Seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place . The story is full of holes , for instance Agent Knowles is contacted by the on the run Harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone . In that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan ? The story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating Government agent is actually a bad guy ! Wow , I didn't see that coming I must say . . . Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snails pace & Today You Die feels like it goes on forever , the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value . The infrequent fight scenes aren't great , most are either shot in shadow , very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind Seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double . Again Seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it , it doesn't . There's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of Las Vegas in this at the start & I thought that Today You Die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called Top of the World ( 1997 ) which is about a Las Vegas casino robbery , as well as using footage from that film Today You Die also edits scenes from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct ( 1998 ) , the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film The Order ( 2001 ) & the Wesley Snipes prison based action film Undisputed ( 2002 ) so quite how much of Today You Die is original footage is anyone's guess . Technically the film is alright , considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough . All the footage of the US locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in Bulgaria . The rap style music that litter Today You Die is awful by the way . The acting is poor & Seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual . Today You Die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films , Seagal looks old & fat , the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all . One to avoid unless your a die hard Seagal fan , if such an animal even exists . . .
499187	1355507	244941	3.0	Toothless mystery thriller horror slasher .	Horror 101 starts as a psychology class at a high school taught by Allison James ( Bo Derek ) are told that the term is coming to an end & that their final assignments must be presented soon with the very last class due for late one Thursday night . The eight students prepare to present their work but one of their number Mark ( Josh Holland ) fails to turn up , the teacher Miss James also mysteriously goes AWOL before the local class psycho Brian ( Justin Urich ) starts behaving weirdly while carrying around what looks like a blood soaked bag . The worried students realise the school is empty , they are alone & as more of them begin to disappear that one of them might be a killer . . . Produced & directed James Glenn Dudelson I am not quite sure who Horror 101 is meant to appeal too or what the makers were trying to achieve . The script apparently took three people to write it which I find simply incredible as it's so predictable , routine & utterly toothless . Horror 101 is an uneasy & unsatisfying mixture of genres from mystery as the students begin to disappear for no apparent reason & no-one knows who is responsible including us the audience , there's a horror element with a typical group of annoying American teens being stalked in a very familiar high school setting & there's a thriller edge as well with various attempts at plot twists & turns which don't come off at all . I mean for instance we never even find out what was in the bag anyway so what was the point of bigging it up so much ? Unfortunately none of these genres are done justice , the mystery elements are rubbish & the red herrings are too obvious the plot & it's outcomes are fairly easy to predict , there's absolutely no horror content worth noting as not one single character is killed ( there's a scene at the start in which someone is killed but this turns out to be part of a film that a class of students are watching ) during the film & not one single drop of blood is shed while the thriller side of things don't work either as seemingly endless scenes of annoying teen character's wandering around high school corridors looking for their lost friends becomes really dull & isn't exciting , suspenseful or thrilling in the slightest . Basically Horror 101 tries to please several sorts of potential viewer buts ends up as a complete disaster that has no edge , no blood , no gore , no sex , no nudity , no thrills , no surprises & a really rubbishy ending that if you can't predict your already dead . Set entirely in a high school the constant bland corridors become very boring & repetitive , the lighting is too bright & there's seemingly no attempt by the filmmakers at atmosphere or scares . Except for a very small scene in a film being watched at the start there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire film , no-one is killed on screen & there's no violence or gore . The character's are annoying & clichéd & are very stupid in their decision making & they all deserve to die which unfortunately never happens so that also ends the film on a downer . Production wise the film actually looks reasonable although there's no real style or class to it , it certainly looks better than a lot of low budget horror crap out there that look like they were shot on a camcorder . The only cast member of note is a small cameo Bo Derek who's most famous role was probably baring all in 10 ( 1979 ) alongside Dudley Moore . Horror 101 is a really poor , boring , uneventful horror mystery thriller that is a total waste of time & doesn't satisfy or deliver on any level . I have no idea who would enjoy this predictable tamer than tame film . Followed by Horror 102 : Endgame ( 2004 ) which I hope is a big improvement on Horror 101 since I'm going to watch it soon .
497361	1355507	132451	3.0	The worst of the series to this point .	Curse of the Puppet Master is set in a small American town where the ever so slightly dim Robert ' Tank ' Winsley ( Josh Green ) works as a lowly gas station attendant for $30 a week , that is until curio collector & owner of a museum of oddities Dr . Magrew ( George Peck ) & his lovely young daughter Jane ( Emily Harrison ) stop for gas . Magrew notices that Robert is an extremely skilled carver with an exceptional imagination & offers him $35 a week to work for him , with the $5 a week pay rise too much to turn down Robert accepts . Dr . Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success . . . Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster ( 1989 ) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6 : The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers . The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 ( 1993 ) & Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter ( 1994 ) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise . Directed by David DeCoteau under the name Victoria Sloan one of his many pseudonym's he had actually directed Puppet Master III : Toulon's Revenge ( 1991 ) but there's no repeat of his earlier magic & Curse of the Puppet Master is pretty dire stuff & even at a paltry 75 odd minutes in length the script feels padded & uneventful . There's no continuity to the earlier films at all , there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films . To be honest it's a lame story which is supposed to unfold as some sort of mystery but it's pretty predictable & the single worst aspect of Curse of the Puppet Master is that it relegates the killer puppets to no more than bit parts who do virtually nothing the entire film . There's no explanation of why the puppets obey Magrew or why they suddenly turn on him at the end & like the previous two films they are nowhere evil enough . Another thing is while Magrew makes Robert carve a puppet out of wood the puppet Magrew uses at the end is actually made out of metal is some awful looking tank like creation with a couple laser guns for arms . The ending is awful too & is one of those occasions where the film just literally stops dead & your left thinking ' is that it ? ' or ' what happened ? ' or ' did my DVD player just skip a chapter ? ' . The puppet special effects are the worst of the series so far too , there's a few seconds of stop-motion by the vast majority of the effects work is simple poorly operated rod puppets which look still & have very limited movement . The opening credits have a montage of special effects shots from the previous five films & they beat anything else seen in this . For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II ( 1991 ) . The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good , there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle . The whole film & production just looks cheaper than the previous entries , the moody setting & lighting have all but gone & there's a bland visually flat & dull look to it . With a supposed budget of about $250 , 000 the budgets were getting lower & lower & it show's frankly . Apparently shot at Canoga Park in Los Angeles . The acting is forgettable from no-one I have ever heard of before . Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III : Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high . The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master ( 1999 ) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too .
497298	1355507	83849	3.0	Exploitation film lacking enough exploitation elements .	Where do I even start ? ! The film , set in San Francisco , opens with two black guys fighting in Dr . Jekyll's ( James Mathers ) lab . Over this fight a narration by Jekyll informs us of the story up to this point . He says " Great Grandfather Jekyll foolishly used his own body as a subject for experimentation , that was his fatal mistake . Once the rage emerged , or as he wrote once Hyde emerged and gained control , Grandfather was lost . In the continuing viewing of my experiments filmed here in the laboratory it is interesting to note how the various subjects react under the influence of the serum . The reaction time of the serum doesn't seem to be affected in any way by the decrease in dosage . I'm able to study the behavioral changes brought about by the different dosages . The black subjects have less hostility in comparison to the whites , one would think they would have more repressed aggressions , perhaps I should increase their dosage . Despite the many failures I have endured thus far , I will continue with the human experimentation and discover the secret that will give me the power to control the mind of man ! " . Jekyll is a complete loon , he was thrown out of Oxford university in 1939 for dissecting a tramp alive . He keeps his assistant and the woman with whom he is in love with , Julia ( Dawn Carver Kelly ) constantly drugged and tied to the front of his wardrobe in his bedroom . His mute sister Hilda ( Nadine Kalmes , who I sort of fancied ) was hopelessly insane from birth and was lobotomized when she was 14 to calm her madness . Boris ( Jake Pearson ) is also mute , he kidnaps people for Dr . Jekyll to perform his experiments on and is a general dogsbody , he is also in love with Julia . Malo ( Tom Nicholson ) who has an afro hair cut and a 70's porno mustache , also helps Jekyll in his experiments , Jekyll describes him as " a fine example of a psychotic killer ! " , he doesn't say a word throughout the entire film either . On the false pretense that his daughter Julia is dead Jekyll invites her Father Professor Atkinson ( John F . Kearney ) to his house . Jekyll wants Atkinson to help him in his experiments . Jekyll tells him that he has developed a cross breed of cattle that produces 30 % more edible meat . But the bulls are docile and refuse to breed , sex stimulants on their own are useless . Jekyll says that while he worked on psychological warfare for the army he developed a pituitary stimulant which released all the aggression buried deep within the unconscious mind . The serum is unstable and the bulls kill the cow after ejaculation ! At first Professor Atkinson agrees to help him , but it soon becomes clear to him that Jekyll has more sinister intentions for the serum . Jekyll confesses " if I can control the dosage so as to counter the rage with the awful need for withdraw then I believe I can keep the subject in a constant state of anxiety , they will follow me then on command ! " Disturbed by this Professor Atkinson refuses to help him any more . If it's possible Dr . Jekyll becomes even crazier in his attempts to perfect the serum . Will he succeed ? Can Professor Atkinson convince him to cease his experiments ? Will the local police figure out that Dr . Jekyll is behind the recent kidnapping spree ? Watch it and find out . Directed by James Woods ( no , not that James Woods ! ) this is one crazy film . The script by Dr . Jekyll himself James Mathers is totally hilarious . Just listen to some of the dialogue , " good god Jekyll does tragedy follow you everywhere ! ? " Jekyll starts to grope a drugged Julia , his sister Hilda looks on in the shadows , he sees her grabs her and says " you have had to bear more agony than I in your wretched young life , your just like Mother , that's why I hate you ! You walk like her , look like her , you even make me want you like her ! " Dr . Jekyll is showing Professor Atkinson some footage of his experiments , he gloats over the possibilities " imagine if you will an army of enraged killers , righteous killers . Who'd need no moral justification for their deeds , ever . No moral questions in battle ! " " You fiend , Jekyll ! You fiend ! You Fiend ! " Line after line , it's just so hilariously entertaining . The relationships between the characters is bizarre as well . Jekyll beats Boris , " yes my friend I know exactly how you feel , love is the most painful emotion of all ! " and burns him with a cigar . He stabs Hilda in the arm with an ice pick because she didn't put any ice in his drink , in this scene Jekyll also attacks a block of ice with the pick shouting " Ice ! Ice ! Ice ! " I am also puzzled as to how Boris can kidnap people so easily . He pulls his car up outside the front of Jekyll's house and proceeds to remove people from the boot and takes them inside over his shoulder . Jekyll's neighbors call the police when they supposedly hear gunshots but don't notice Boris and all the unconscious people he brings home in the boot of his car ! Unfortunately , apart from the wacky script and bizarre characters there is little to recommend here . The film has no blood or gore and very little violence , the fight scenes look OK and seem well choreographed , with the exception of the odd punch here and there that obviously miss by a mile . Another exploitation element that appears to have been completely , and disappointingly ignored is naked flesh , there isn't any nudity or sex in it at all . The film is extremely dark and sometimes difficult to see whats happening . The entire film is set in Jekyll's large house , film never leaves the confines of his house or grounds . Acting is all over the place , Hilda , Julia , Boris and Malo don't say a word during the whole film so they don't have much acting to do . I did like Hilda though , probably because I fancied her . So , the entire film is basically Mathers as Jekyll who overacts wildly , in fact he's quite funny to watch . The only other speaking character is Professor Atkinson , but Kearney isn't given much to do with him . The script is surreal , the dialogue is hilarious , and the characters bizarre , if only they could have made a good exploitation film around these elements , but they didn't and the film is poor in just about every other department , and with no blood , gore or nudity there's not a whole lot of reason to watch this . I found some of it really funny , but all things considered , don't bother wasting your time .
497111	1355507	144814	3.0	Really bad sequel .	The Rage : Carrie 2 starts with the Mother ( J . Smith-Cameron ) of a young girl with telekinesis named Rachael ( Kayla Campbell ) being taken away by paramedics to rot in in insane asylum . Jump forward several years later & Rachael ( Emily Bergl ) is now a freaky looking goth wannabe teenage high school student who all the popular kids think is a skank & to add to her worries she only has one friend , Lisa Parker ( Mena Suvari ) . If that wasn't enough one of the football jocks Eric Stark ( Zachery Ty Bryan ) dumps Lisa in a rather unfriendly way , Lisa is devastated & commits suicide by jumping off the school roof . Eric & the other lads seem more concerned about the damage to the car Lisa landed on while Rachael is understandably gutted , as Rachael begins to discover the cruel joke played on Lisa & herself by her fellow students she delivers her own unique violent brand of revenge as she goes into a rage . . . Directed by Katt Shea , who also has a small role in the film as an assistant D . A . , I thought The Rage : Carrie 2 was a pretty awful film . The original Carrie ( 1976 ) is a brilliant horror / thriller & my IMDb comment exists to prove that I think that but this supposed sequel fails in almost every respect in which the original was so good . The script by Rafael Moreu is slow , it has the most clichéd & unlikable character's imaginable , it's wholly predictable , there's no subtlety & there is virtually zero build up or development unlike the original . The dialogue was bad , the character's didn't work & I really fail to see why Lisa & Rachael were treated as outcasts as I thought they were both very attractive & seemed pretty ' normal ' , the whole concept of Rachael as an outsider & social misfit just didn't work as she comes across as far too normal . One of the reasons why the original was such a good & powerful film was of Carrie & the fantastic & utterly believable Oscar nominated performance by Sissy Spacek , can the same be said about Bergl ? She ain't getting anywhere near an Oscar unless she steals one ! Unfortunately the central character & how you feel towards them is essential for the film to work so when it's messed up as badly as it is here the film suffers . For most of it's dull running time The Rage : Carrie 2 plays like a teen drama with the boring romance between Rachael & Jesse ( Jason London ) dominating things , it's not until the bland climax that Rachael uses her powers to any entertaining effect . Director Shea does nothing , her idea of style is to shake the camera a bit , insert a few black & white shots & have a stupid sound effect when Rachael uses her powers , yuk . It has none of the elegant class of the original . The scene at the end when Rachael's tattoo starts to grow & cover her body is meaningless & looks terrible . The climax is basically the same as the original with Rachael using her powers to take revenge on her tormentors , at least there's some blood during this bit . A couple of people are impaled on pokers , someones glasses shatter which make their eyes explode , someone has a spear shot through his groin & in a hilarious bit someone is attacked by a plastic pool cover which knocks him out ! I was simply amazed to learn that The Rage : Carrie 2 had a supposed budget of about $21 , 000 , 000 , where did all the money go ? That seems like an awful lot of money , there's no big name stars , no special effects until the end , no exotic locations , no stunts or action scenes & it's set almost entirely in the same place . It's generally well made but then for that sort of money that's the minimum requirement . The acting was pretty bad with Amy Irving the only returning original cast member . The Rage : Carrie 2 is an awful film that doesn't deserve to feed off the reputation of the original , this is definitely a sanitised bottle-less version of Carrie for the teenage masses . In my opinion apart from a few half decent deaths at the end The Rage : Carrie 2 sucks , it's as simple & straight forward as that .
498321	1355507	78398	3.0	" You will be a vegetable when I've finished with you . " - They're not wrong either !	Tigress , or Ilsa , Tigress of Siberia as I'm positive it's more commonly know as , starts in ' Serbia 1953 ' where Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne ) runs a prison camp for Russian dictator Josef Stalin who sends various enemies of the state there for readjustment , if that's the right word . Ilsa runs Gulag 14 with an iron fist , anyone who tries to escape is killed , anyone who refuses to work is killed & anyone who steps out of line is killed . One fateful day the news reaches Ilsa that Stalin has been overthrown , Ilsa orders the destruction of the camp & the execution of all the prisoners but one inmate , political dissident Andre , manages to escape with his life along with Ilsa & a couple of her sadistic guards . Jump to ' Montreal 1977 ' & Andre is in town to accompany a Russian hockey team for some sort of Olympic tournament when a couple of the team want to go to a brothel & have sex with a couple of prostitutes . However this particular brothel is run by Ilsa who spots Andre & thinks his appearance is far from a coincidence , Ilsa has Andre kidnapped for reasons that aren't overly clear or logical but both parties have vengeance on their minds . . . This Canadian production was directed by Jean LaFleur & Tigress was the fourth Ilsa film in a series that began with Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS ( 1975 ) . To be honest I think all of the Ilsa films are pretty rotten & Tigress isn't any different . The script by Marven McGara starts off impressively with Ilsa the Commander of an isolated prison camp , this is probably the best 40 odd minutes that the entire series has to offer as it has a nice exploitative feel with plenty of torture , executions , sex & some unintentionally funny dialogue . Unfortunately for the remainder of Tigress it shifts to Canada & a really boring soft core sex / gangster type film that is absolutely excruciating to sit through . The first & second halves of Tigress are as different as can be , it's almost as if two separate films had been spliced together ( badly ) & the only common threads are Andre & Ilsa . The first half of the film moves along at a nice pace & actually pretty good while the second half is as dull as dishwater & complete total & utter crap . I really don't know who this film would appeal to or who it would please , overall it's a pretty rubbish film taken as a whole . Director LaFleur does a good job for the first half as he keeps things moving along but the second half ruins everything . Don't expect much style or visual flair but it has a nice sleazy atmosphere at times during the first half . I personally think Tigress is the most gory of the Ilsa films , the fights & shootouts feature lots of blood , there are impalings , stabbings , someone has their head smashed to pieces with a hammer , someone gets chopped up in one of those snow clearing machines , people are fed to Tigers & a really graphic scene of a guy having his hand chainsawed off while playing the ultimate game of arm wrestling . There is a fair amount of nudity & some really unsexy sex scenes which are about as much of a turn on as a slap in the face with a wet fish . Technically Tigress is alright , it's competently made throughout although some it is rather bland . The music used is the same as various cues from Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . The acting is poor especially Thorne as Ilsa whom I think is ugly , old , a terrible actress & her large saggy breasts leave me cold & her shower scene had me reaching for the stop button but since I'm such a masochist I stuck with it . Tigress is a poor exploitation film , the first half is as good as the Ilsa series gets but the second half is probably as worse as it gets which takes some doing , it's as simple & straight forward as that . Definitely not recommended as there are far better exploitation films out there .
496958	1355507	377749	3.0	Boring nonsense .	Dead Birds starts in the small American town of Fairhope Alabama during the year 1863 where a gang hold up the local bank , they kill a few people & steal lots of gold . As they make their escape the plan is to stay at an old farm house before moving onto Mexico , simple yet effective I'm sure you'll agree . However not everything goes according to plan & it turns out that the guy who owned the farm house a few years back was some sort of Satan worshipper , bummer eh ? It's not long before everyone starts seeing ghosts & such things . . . Directed by Alex Turner I have to say I was very unimpressed with Dead Birds so it comes as a shock that it seems to have so many positive comments written about it . The script which feels like a lame cross between Ravenous ( 1999 ) & From Dusk Till dawn ( 1996 ) by co-producer Simon Barrett takes itself very seriously & is slow , very slow & I must admit that I lose interest very quickly in slow , boring , dull & predictable films such as Dead Birds . You can easily guess what's going to happen , you know the scenario where a group of people become stuck in an isolated located through certain circumstances , they all begin to wander off on their own & get killed one-by-one . To be honest Dead Birds isn't even a decent haunted house supernatural horror , there are too many vague elements to it , the climax where everything is supposedly revealed is weak & less than shocking & the twist end made no sense to me at all . I was not impressed with any aspect of Dead Birds including that awful title which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself as far as I could tell . Director Turner does an OK job but there's nothing spectacular on show here , the period setting is reasonably well realised but it all felt a bit sparse & low budget , just putting a candle in a room doesn't mean it looks like it belongs in the 17th century does it ? Overall the film was very unsatisfying to me , the story could have been tighter & better fleshed out & it's extremely slow . There's an OK atmosphere but I'd say it was low on scares & also lacking in decent gore . There's a bit of blood including a blown off head at the start during the robbery but afterwards it's pretty dry apart from a decapitation , some chopped up horses & something bursting out a woman's stomach . Obviously shot on a low budget Dead Birds is well made but it's hardly going to knock any houses down . The acting was alright , to be honest I can't remember anyone from it or their performances & I only saw it a few hours ago . Dead Birds is a boring , predictable & not very good low budget horror film . Amazingly it seems to have fans out there so I guess it's doing something right although to be honest I sure as hell couldn't see it . Not recommended , by me anyway .
498116	1355507	339135	3.0	" Your more useful to me as a btch . " Terrible Van Damme flick .	In Hell is set in Russia where American contractor Kyle ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) arrives home one night to discover his wife Grey ( Marnie Alton ) dead & some Russian scumbag with a knife , Kyle gives chase but loses him . When the police finally catch up with the guy he pays the judge off & walks away scott free , Kyle takes exception to this & using a cop's handgun dishes out his own justice . Before Kyle can say ' I did it for my wife ' he's been sentenced to life in a prison called Kravovia , it's a hell hole where they give you slop to eat , where the guards regularly beat you , your fellow inmates are big hairy ugly Russian mother fers & it's the sort of establishment where you definitely don't bend over in the shower . Kyle quickly discovers that the guards put on fights between two inmates to amuse the sadistic warden so he pours a frying pan of chip fat over his hair , grows a stupid gay looking goatee beard & decides to join in . . . Directed by Ringo Lam I am genuinely surprised at how many positive comments In Hell has on the IMDb , although while I'm surprised I don't really care as I thought it was crap . The script by Eric Jmaes Virgets , Jorge Alvarez , Steve Latshaw & Les Weldon tries to be some serious prison drama as in Midnight Express ( 1978 ) & The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) but falls totally flat on it's face , by the time the ghost of JCVD's dead wife show's up all credibility had gone out of the window & the scenes where he takes inspiration from a flying magical moth are hilariously bad & out of place . Then there's the action , or rather the disappointing lack of it . JCVD doesn't get into a fight until over an hour into the thing & even then it's uninspiring stuff before he suddenly sees the error of his ways & that fighting is ' wrong ' before he gives an embarrassing emotional speech to the rest of his fellow inmates at the end which is accompanied by violins on the soundtrack ! I also thought In Hell had an unhealthy preoccupation with gay sex & was very homophobic , I mean there's plenty of butt raping action going on as inmates rape one another just about every night & there's even a flashback sequence which show's why JCVD's cell mate is in prison which revolves around him setting someone on fire who was going to butt rape him . I mean every gay bloke in In Hell is portrayed as some big , brutish , rapist freak of nature ! Director Lam is sandbagging it here , the entire first hour is nothing more than constant tedious scenes of JCVD having a hard time , getting picked on by the guards & inmates , given slop to eat , left in solitary confinement & just about every other prison film cliché that establishes that it's not a very nice place to be . JCVD starts off OK in this but then he grows his hair long & a beard as he resembles a homeless wino before he slicks it all back & has this awful looking little goatee beard on his chin . The action scenes are poor , there's no slow motion roundhouse kicks here , it's pretty dull pub brawl type fights . The violence is also tame & there's never any reason given for why that guy kills JCVD's wife at the start . With a supposed budget of about $17 , 000 , 000 this had a fair amount of money spent on it & I have to say apart from the sets & locations I can't really see where the money went . It was shot in Bulgaria & it's well made for what it is but there are loads of well made films out there that actually have a decent story too . The acting isn't great & I can't believe anyone actually says JCVD is good in this . In Hell is a film that tries to be something it's not , it tries to be a prison drama but the character's & situations are so bad it all ends up coming across like a comedy as the action scenes feel like an afterthought . Personally I thought it was pants .
499220	1355507	90233	3.0	Pretty bad film featuring a good cast .	Underworld starts as English high class hooker Nicole ( Nicola Cowper ) is kidnapped from her brothel . Rich businessman Hugo Motherskille ( Steven Berkoff ) hires her ex love Roy Bain ( Larry Lamb ) to find her , he heads straight for the brothel where he finds out she was addicted to a new drug called ' WhiteMare ' developed by posh Doctor Savary ( Denholm Elliott ) as a cure for heroin addiction . Unfortunately while it cured the test subjects of their addiction to heroin they became addicted to WhiteMare itself & it also has unwanted body deforming consequences & side effects . Not good really . However Nicole seems immune to the drugs side effects & a group of deformed users want to know why , it's up to Roy to sort this mess out & rescue Nicole . . . Known as Transmutations in the US this English production was directed by George Pavlou & quite frankly is crap . The script by James Caplin & Clive Barker based on one of his stories never really gets going , it never involves you , you never care about anything , it's slow , it's dull , it's utterly predictable with a pointless twist you can see coming a mile off & it's just not much fun to watch either . Being based on a story by Barker you would expect plenty of monsters & gore but Underworld features a few tardily made up creatures who get about 10 minutes worth of screen time & absolutely no gore whatsoever . I'm sure the artwork on any DVD / video release plays up the mutants involvement in the film but seriously they don't feature properly until past the hour mark & even then their presence is underwhelming . Most of Barker's work deals with religion & mystical reasoning behind his monstrous creations but here it all revolves around a drug , yawn . Then there's the fact that London seems deserted , the character's & dialogue are poor & for some reason everyone has bizarre names like Pepperdine , Motherskille , Fluke & Nygaard . We never learn why Nicole is immune to the drugs side effects either even though it's an important plot point , it's a film where you just don't care about anything that's happening on screen . Director Pavlou also directed the Barker penned adaptation of Rawhead Rex ( 1986 ) a year later , why did Barker choose him again ? Underworld is a totally flat , dull & lifeless 100 odd minutes . He seems to think as long as he bathes every shot in pink , purple , orange & blue neon that's enough to turn in a stylish flick , well he's wrong as it gets very samey very quickly & since the on screen action is so dull the awkward lighting stands out like a sore thumb . Disappointingly the film lacks imagination as well , the underworld mutants are just actors with lumps on their faces & apart from one brief scene at the end when someone pulls some skin of their cheek there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing . It's definitely not scary , it's certainly has no tension & has precisely zero atmosphere . Technically the film is pretty good actually , it's well made I suppose & looks very professional . How on Earth did they get such a good cast to agree to appear in this ? Denholm Elliott , Steven Berkoff , Art Malik , Ingrid Pitt & Miranda Richardson all deserve better than this . Underworld is a poor Clive Barker penned film , I'd imagine most of the blame has to go to first time director Pavlou who probably ruined Barker's scripts ( Barker himself admitted he directed Hellraiser ( 1987 ) himself because of his dissatisfaction with the results of both Underworld & Rawhead Rex ) . A disappointing waste of time , steer clear which won't be a problem as it's pretty obscure & hopefully it'll stay that way . Not to be confused with the Kate Beckinsale big budget horror action flicks Underworld ( 2003 ) & it's sequel Underworld : Evolution ( 2006 ) .
497080	1355507	681741	3.0	The first of the moralistic episodes .	Quincy M . E . : A Good Smack in the Mouth starts late one Californian night as Melissa Asten ( Barbara Babcock ) stops to pick up a young nine year old boy named Joseph Harrison ( Shane Sinutko ) who is standing on the side of a freeway hitching a ride , a short time later Melissa is involved in an accident & her car ends up in a ditch on the side of the road . Since Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) is out of town his friend Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is informed that Mrs . Asten is in hospital , he visits her & also visits the boy Joey & after looking at his x-rays is shocked to see lots of injuries , the only explanation is child abuse & he is determined to protect Joey from his abusive parents . . . Episode 8 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Jackie Cooper & has the ( unwanted in my opinion ) distinction of being the first almost entirely social or moralistic issue based episode of Quincy & I pretty much hated every heavy handed preaching second of it . The main theme that A Good Smack in the Mouth tackles is the sensitive issue of child abuse which is fine but I don't really want to be watching such things , I want to be entertained & I much prefer the murder mystery episodes which involve laboratory work & Quincy playing detective . Here there is no laboratory work at all , A Good Smack in the Mouth is also one of the very few Quincy episodes not to feature a single autopsy or even so much as a dead body . I also thought the story was poor & badly written , it is claimed that the victim of abuse will show much , much more love towards the abuser . Eh ? How does that work ? I simply cannot believe a nine year old child will show more love towards someone who is beating them , I would buy that the boy wouldn't want to make him angry but to show that much affection is just hard to believe . Even sub consciously through the likes of body language & tone of voice would have given the boy away . Then there's the idea that one parent would just stand by & let the other beat their child , I would buy that if both parents were beating the child or if one of the parents simply didn't care but in A Good Smack in the Mouth the mother clearly states she does care & I just can't believe one caring parent would let their partner beat their child for years & not do a thing about it . There's an amusing scene in A Smack in the Mouth when Quincy visits a bored half naked housewife named Mona who gives Quincy the come on until her big burly bearded husband comes home , it's a funny little scene & probably the best in the programme . The acting is pretty good here with Klugman shining as the caring coroner , he gets to show a bit of fatherly love as well towards the boy . A Good Smack in the Mouth is maybe the very first totally moralistic based Quincy episode & it's not a good one . I really didn't like it at all & thought the story was just unbelievable & didn't convince me at all .
499298	1355507	443438	3.0	" Your a loser & your piece of sht film is going straight to cable . " Another low budget shot on a camcorder horror flick .	Back Slash is set on a college campus where aspiring filmmaker Ledo ( Stephen J . Burge ) is directing a horror film called ' Death Blood ' which is a self confessed cross between The Blair Witch Project & a Jason film , however his star Brenda ( Tara Platt ) is brutally murdered by someone dressed as the films killer . Then another young female student named Debbie ( Jill Uden ) is also killed in the same way , with a slash across her back & her liver cut out . The only link between the victims is that they were both voted the ' hottest girl on campus ' & appeared on a website , things don't look good for the two new hottest girl's on campus Martha ( Gretchen Akers ) & Amie ( Laura Bruner ) who are understandably worried . They decide to play detective & track the killer down & expose them before they become his next victim's . . . Written , produced & directed by Kevin Campbell who also is credited with playing the killer this cheap no budget slasher flick really isn't anything to get excited about at all , in fact to be brutally honest it's pretty bad all round . The script doesn't takes itself too seriously & is a straight rip-off of any low budget horror teen slasher film you care to mention , the identity of the killer comes as no real surprise & the motives are poor to say the least . However Back Slash surprisingly has some amusing dialogue which if it were part of a better film , delivered by better actor's could have made for a fun slasher unfortunately it isn't , it wasn't & thus it ain't . The character's aren't as annoying as I expected but since they are stuck in such a poor film it matters little , there's also plenty of Scream ( 1996 ) styled self referential nods towards the horror film genre in general with the entire story based around the making of a horror film & one amusing moment when a character quips ' The Blair Witch Project was a piece of sht yet made 165 million because people thought it was real ' although one line of dialogue is hardly enough to recommend a film . Otherwise it's clichéd teen slasher stuff all the way , the killer is inconsistent as he kills girls with a slash to the back & then removes their liver to start with but then totally abandons that method for no reason , there are some awkward & obvious red herrings ( you know people really do keep freshly decapitated deer heads in boxes in their basements don't they ? ) , stupid plot holes ( would a girl punching someone around the face once really put them in a coma ? ! ) & people don't call the police when they should , I mean wouldn't that CD with the killers voice on it be of interest to the investigating police ? It's a touch on the slow side too , the whole internet angle is poorly handled & amounts to nothing in the end & there are just much better teen slashers out there for anyone to be wasting either their time or money on Black Slash & it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Campbell was obviously working on a low budget but as I've said many times before & no doubt will many many times more a low budget is no excuse for such a crappy film & I'm not going to forgive both technical & conceptual incompetence purely because of a low budget . It's not scary in the slightest & there are too many annoyingly predictable instances where your supposed to think the killer is on screen yet it turns out to be the actor from the Death Blood film & vice versa where it's supposed to be the actor but it is in fact the killer . There's not much gore , the same liver removing effect is shown a few times , there's a severed penis & a bit of blood but little else to get excited about . There is however a fair amount of female nudity going on if that's your thing . Another low budget horror seemingly shot on a camcorder rather than proper film this looks grubby & cheap as well , I suspect the camcorder was even high definition either . Technically the film is rough & has low production values , I wonder if QuickTime gave the makers permission to use their Windows media player ? Shot in Denver in Colorado . The acting is poor by everyone , the actor's look nice enough but obviously can't act & that spoils what could have been some amusing dialogue . Back Slash is a poor teen slasher & there's no other way I can describe it , the murders are poor , the gore is poor , the acting is poor , the photography is poor & , well you get the message . One to avoid I'm afraid .
498566	1355507	82744	3.0	Pretty poor crazy backwoods family slasher film with very little to recommend it .	Midnight starts with a brief sacrifice scene , enjoy it while it lasts because we don't get anymore for over an hour . After the credits have run we are introduced to a 17 year girl ( yeah right sure she is ! ) named Nancy Johnson ( Melanie Verlin ) who lives with her fat ugly step Father Bert ( Lawrence Tierney ) a police man & her Mother Harriet ( Doris Hackney ) . One day Bert arrives home drunk & tries to molest Nancy who obviously doesn't like his unwanted amorous paedophile advances & packs her bags intending to hitchhike her way to visit her sister in California . After standing by the side of the road for a while two guys in a van named Hank ( Charles Jackson ) & Tom ( John Hall ) offer her a lift . They say that they're going to Louisberg in Florida & that's she welcome to join them , Nancy jumps at the opportunity & they hit the open road . They stop off in a small town called Kaylor for gas & meet a priest who warns them about the area where several people have been found murdered in the woods , they ignore his warnings & decide to find a place to set up camp for the night . Little do the three realise that a crazy Satan worshipping family are stalking the area looking for suitable sacrifices & decide our trio will do nicely . . . Written & directed by John A . Russo based on his own novel of the same name I personally thought Midnight was a bit of a waste of time & offered little in the way of entertainment value . The script is so dull & slow it virtually grinds to a halt on occasion . The backwoods family & sporadic horror elements aren't properly introduced until after the hour mark , what proceeds is just teenage drama & angst as Nancy runs away from home & goes on a road-trip with Tom & Hank . The script pulls out all the redneck clichés , the townspeople are aggressive , don't like strangers & all drink moonshine while the local police are depicted as heavy handed racists who don't like strangers either . The bad guys are clichéd too , a crazy backwoods family who talk & take orders from one of their dead relatives in this case their Mother , a big fat ugly guy with a beard Cyrus ( David Marchick ) , a young teenage almost innocent looking girl Cynthia ( Robin Walsh ) as well as two ' comedy ' Brothers Luke ( Greg Besnak ) & Abraham ( John Amplas ) . There are few characters in Midnight & none are particularly likable or interesting . I also thought the climax was extremely underwhelming with the hero performing a daring rescue mostly taking place outside the crazy families front door on their porch ! Russo obviously doesn't have a sense for the dramatic because a front porch is hardly the place to hold an exciting conclusion to a film , is it ? The sacrificial alter is nothing more than a dark room with a cross on the wall & a white wooden throne with some burning candles on it , again very little effort seems to have gone into the design & execution of a vital make-or-break scene . It's very stupid at times too , how can a crazy fat farmer walk around in broad daylight with a dead priest over his shoulder & not be noticed ? Would you spend the night in some woods where several murders have taken place ? You know , I don't think I would . One of the reasons I wanted to see Midnight is because of the Tom Savini special make-up effects credit , please don't be fooled like me as there is virtually no blood or gore in Midnight at all . There's an effective bullet through the head shot & a blink & you'll miss it decapitation with a machete , that's it . In fact at one point as a character is having her throat slit Russo freezes the shot for a few seconds so not to have to show any sort of gore , it's almost as if Russo didn't want any blood in Midnight at all . What a wasted opportunity to exploit Savini's excellent skills at make-up effect's . There isn't any nudity either I'm afraid . Technically Midnight is pretty rough , very basic point & shoot photography , the film appears to have been shot in natural light which gives it a dark grimy unpleasant look throughout , it doesn't have much of a musical score instead relying heavily on some of the most awful & out-of-place sounding ' songs ' you can imagine , the acting is below average but I've sat through worse & director Russo fails to create or sustain any periods of atmosphere or tension . Overall I can't really say anything good about Midnight apart from the fact that Tom Savini provided a couple of cool gore effects & the last 30 odd minutes picks up somewhat , at least it kept me from falling asleep which I was threatening to do at that point . Don't waste your time as there are much better horror films out there to be seen , when all said & done Midnight was very disappointing .
497192	1355507	366530	3.0	" Suicide attempts don't count , especially failed ones . " Pretty bad .	Goth starts as two wannabe Goth's Chrissy ( Laura Reilly ) & her boyfriend Boone ( Dave Stan ) arrive at a goth nightclub somewhere in Los Angeles & start dancing to some absolutely horrendous ' music ' , while waiting to use the toilet Chrissy bumps into a girl named Gothe ( Phoebe Dollar ) who says if she & her boyfriend meet her out back she can let them have some drugs for nowt , obviously too good an opportunity to turn down it's not long before all three are indulging in a drug Gothe calls ' White Light ' . But it doesn't end there because Gothe is in fact some twisted messed up psycho who likes to terrorise , torture & kill people & she has decided to take Chrissy & Bone along for her latest night of fun . . . Written & directed by Brad Sykes I don't really know what to say about Goth , I mean there's very little here by which to get excited about & it's a bit of a chore to sit through . The script which seems to take itself extremely seriously at least moves along at a reasonable pace & to it's credit it wasn't that boring but when the story , the character's & the dialogue are all so tedious & lame it sort of cancels it out . For a start no explanation was given for Gothe's motives , none other than she was a true goth which I would imagine could upset real life Goth's who wouldn't like being portrayed as vicious killers . The character's of Chrissy & Boone are terrible , they spend virtually the entire film discussing how to get away from Gothe yet do nothing , I mean Gothe is just a skinny girl surely both Chrissy & Boone could have overpowered her ? Then there's the frankly ridiculous twist which is somehow supposed to connect Gothe & Chrissy but again this makes no sense if you think about it as Chrissy could have done what she was planning to a long time ago & saved us from having to sit through this which would have killed two birds with one stone . The set pieces & exploitation scenes are poor , it never really entertains or even amuses & then there's the mysterious van driver that we never see whose only purpose in life it seems is to wait in Gothe's van & drive her around wherever she wants to go . Director Sykes is renowned for ultra low budget horror film junk like this & Goth doesn't exactly enhance his reputation , there's no style to the thing at all & Goth is the only film that has ever had me reach for the mute button on my remote control within the first 5 minutes as the opening scenes in the nightclub feature a truly horrible song that literally was giving me a headache so I had to turn the sound off until it stopped . The gore isn't anything special , there'some cutting of skin , there's a slit throat & a few stabbings but nothing to write home about . There's some nudity including some overweight women which frankly looks hideous & is far more scary & disturbing than anything else seen in Goth . Goth probably had a budget that wouldn't stretch to a round of drinks down your local & it shows , the camera work is terrible & it was obviously shot on horrible grainy video , the lighting is poor & the production design consists of the back of Gothe's van & a few seedy hotel rooms . The music is grating & even the costumes seem flat & dull . The acting isn't going to win anyone any awards , Reilly & Stan are both awful although Dollar isn't too bad as the villain . Goth is the sort of film you don't really watch you just endure it , the positive thing I can say is that it keeps moving but when everything else is so bad it hardly matters . Not recommended .
497620	1355507	303773	4.0	" They looked like flying Piranha for Christ's sake . " Dull as dishwater killer bugs film .	Deadly Swarm starts in ' Central Guatamala ' where evil misguided scientist Dr . Schroeder ( J . Patrick McCormack ) has found a new species of Wasp , a deadly species of Wasp known as ' Black Fire ' that he hopes will help him create a cure for various diseases , don't ask . Dr . Schroeder pays a local drug runner to take the deadly Wasp's over the border & back into the U . S . but en route the truck crashes & the deadly Wasp's are released ! At a nearby Mexican town American entomologist Daniel Lang ( Shane Brolly ) is conducting research on Mosquito's when his friend Commandante Alvarez ( Pepe Serna ) ask's him to take a look at the crash site because the first Officer on the scene is now dead covered in stings & since Daniel is an expert on insects , well you get the idea . At first Daniel isn't sure but finds a large hive made from bone fragments in a box in the back of the truck which he takes away for analysis . Meanwhile nosey novelist Sandra Kern ( Kaarina Aufranc ) senses a story & sticks close to Daniel as he discovers that these deadly Wasp's lay eggs in their victims which eventually hatch sending 1000's more Wasp's on their way to repeat the process , they must be stopped as does the dangerous experiments of Schroeder . . . This American Mexican co-production was directed by Paul Andresen & is a bit of a snooze-fest . The script takes itself extremely seriously & is rather mundane & predictable not to mention the fact that it's a little on the clichéd side . I mean there's the good looking hero , a good scientist , an evil misguided scientist , a reporter , the uncaring Mayor who doesn't want to cancel a local festival for money reasons , the police guy & the disposable victims , they're all here . The film is pretty dull to watch , it's far from exciting as it plods along in a fairly standard linear way , there is at first an unidentified threat , hero identifies threat & then destroys threat & gets the girl & that's it , that's as much & as original as Deadly Swarm strives to be , it's as simple & straight forward as that . The character's are OK & it moves along at a reasonable pace but I just couldn't stop myself from becoming bored with it . There's a real lack of action or Wasp attacks & the climax absolutely sucks & isn't worth watching the preceding 80 minutes to see . I'm not sure about the start either , are the filmmakers really trying to tell us that a deadly species of Wasp lives only in the abandoned ruins of a Aztec temple ( or whatever it is ) & never leave it's confines , I mean Wasp's can fly can't they ? Why don't they just fly away ? Why live in some ruins ? What do they eat ? Why has no one ever seen them before ? Also , while on the subject of these Wasp's they're a bit dull & mundane in themselves aren't they ? I mean their not mutated Wasp's , not genetically engineered Wasp's , giant over-sized Wasp's or anything like that they're just , well ordinary looking Wasp's which just didn't inspire or excite me at all . Director Andresen doesn't do anything particularly memorable , the film has a certain made-for-TV look & feel to it . When you think about it Deadly Swarm doesn't make a whole lot of sense , there are no scares , there's no shocks & the Wasp attack scenes are pretty bad with terrible CGI . There is no gore whatsoever , a few people covered in stings but that's it apart from a scene when a swarm of Wasp's emerge from someones stomach but the CGI is so bad during this scene it doesn't count & there's no blood either . Technically Deadly Swarm is competent & generally well made except for some awful special effects , the Mexican locations are quite bright & nice but hardly worth watching the film for . The acting wasn't up to much & didn't do anything for me . Deadly Swarm is a lame killer bug film that lacks any gore , any action & has a predictable & dull story . If you haven't already seen 100 films like this ( which I have unfortunately ) then you may like it as it's watchable but it won't knock anyone's socks off that's for sure . Only if your desperate or easily pleased .
497614	1355507	83722	4.0	A nation of animal lovers ? Yeah , but this is quite literally going too far .	Irena Gallier ( Nastassja Kinski ) arrives in New Orleans for the first time . Irena is greeted at the airport by her brother Paul ( Malcolm McDowell ) who she has never met . Paul takes Irena back to his house but soon disappears . A prostitute named Ruthie ( Lynn Lowry ) is late for a client . She enters the seedy room and finds a strange slimy substance on the bed . She also notices a black fury thing sticking out from under the bed , she kicks it with her high heeled shoes and it turns out to be the tail belonging to a huge black Leopard which mauls her ankle but she manages to escape . Oh , and her bra ' rips ' in the middle exposing her breasts . The massage parlour's manager ( John H . Fields ) traps the Leopard in the room and calls the authorities . The city zoo's curator Dr . Oliver Yates ( John Heard ) and his team , Alice Perrin ( Annette O'Toole ) and Joe Creigh ( Ed Begley Jr . ) are called in to capture the Leopard . Irena decides to see the sights that New Orleans has to offer . Irena eventually ends up at the zoo where she sees the Leopard , now safely behind the bars of a cage . Irena stays behind after the zoo closes and is found by Oliver . They strike up a friendship and within a few hours Oliver has given Irena a job in the zoo's gift shop . One day while Joe tries to feed the Leopard it rips his arm off and Joe dies , Oliver decides to shoot the Leopard but when he returns with a gun he finds the Leopard gone and a strange slimy substance on the floor . That night Paul returns home and confronts Irena , making sexual advances towards her . Irena runs from Paul and stops a police car . Back at Paul's house they make a grisly discovery in the basement . Paul needs Irena and will do whatever it takes to convince her she needs him too . Things become even more complicated when Irena and Oliver fall in love but Irena refuses to have sex with him , as events unfold it becomes clear that Irena and Paul both harbour a dark secret . Extensively re-written and directed by Paul Schrader I thought this was one of the dullest and most boring nothing horror films that I have seen in some time . The script that was originally written by Alan Ormsby before the re-write by Schrader is so slow it's frightening , and at almost two hours long the Cat People outstays it's welcome well before the end credits roll . For most of the first hour , maybe a little more , it's no more than a drama as the film focuses on Oliver's and Irena's relationship and not much else . The film also has many unnecessary sequences and drags , badly . Another small problem is that the film tries to present it's story as some kind of mystery , well I don't want to seem fussy but the films title is ' Cat People ' and that sort of gives it away and it doesn't come as a surprise that people turn into Leopards if you know what I mean . One more thing I don't understand , if these cat people turn into Leopards during or after sexual contact why has Paul already turned into one before the prostitute even enters the room ? Most of the characters are a little on the bitty side and somewhat underdeveloped . I also think it was a mistake to cast Kinski who can't act and on occasion looks like a man with her short hair ( hey , it's true ) and McDowell seems uninterested and unsuited to the role of the bad guy . I have to say that I didn't care about any of the characters involved which is never a good thing in a film . The film has lots of nudity with Kinski the main culprit as she exposes her breasts and body numerous times during the last 30 or so minutes , having said that though most of the female cast take their tops off at some point . There are some strong sex scenes too , especially at the end when Oliver ties a naked Kinski to the bed by her wrists and ankles and then has fairly explicit sex with her . Unfortunately the horror element of the story is severely lacking , in fact there is very little horror in it . There is very little gore either , an autopsy on a Leopard , a bitten off arm and a mangled dead body is about it . The transformation sequence is so short as to be almost inconsequential , although the meagre screen time it does get the transformation looks quite cool . However I will admit that the film has a really nice look throughout and great cinematography by John Bailey which captures the New Orleans locations extremely well . Personally I really didn't find much in this film to like , I will admit that it's well made and tells a story competently enough but I just found the whole thing so dull and uneventful . This is not a film that I can recommend , there are much better horror films out there .
498387	1355507	112896	4.0	" Put him in a straight jacket & give him an enema . " Not very funny comedy / horror .	Dracula : Dead and Loving It starts in Transylvania during the year 1593 where British solicitor R . M . Renfield ( Peter MacNicol ) has a meeting with Count Dracula ( Leslie Nielsen ) to conclude the sale of Carfax Abbey in England . Once the forms are signed Dracula travels to London to take up residence in his new property which is situated next to a mental asylum run by Dr . Jack Seward ( Harvey Korman ) & as Dracula introduces himself he notices Lucy Westenra ( Lysette Anthony ) a friend of Seward's daughter Mina ( Amy Yasbeck ) & takes an unhealthy interest in her as he changes into a bat , flies into her room while she is asleep & drinks her blood . Lucy becomes ill & Seward calls in Dr . Abraham Van Helsing ( Mel Brooks ) an expert on rare diseases who quickly realises that Lucy has been bitten by a Vampire . It's up to Van Helsing to save the day & Seward's daughter Mina who Dracula intends to become his next victim . . . This American French co-production was co-written , produced , directed & starred Mel Brooks & to be honest it didn't do that much for me . The script by Brooks , Rudy De Luca & Steve Haberman follows Bram Stoker's original novel surprisingly closely & retains most of the relevant action & character's but just spoofs everything up . While the story is solid the decision to turn the film into a silly slapstick comedy first & foremost is one that doesn't work , surely Dracula : Dead and Loving It would have worked much better if the filmmakers had worked around the principal that they were making a horror film first as per the original novel & structure the comedy , the gags & the spoof material around it . As it is Dracula : Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead ( 1982 ) or Dog Soldiers ( 2002 ) , I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror . Just a thought . Another big problem with Dracula : Dead and Loving It is that it's just not very funny , in fact as to prove my point the best scene is when Harker & Van Helsing stake Lucy through the heart & are covered in gallons of blood , horror first guys , horror first . . . The only other funny moments in it are two running gags , one about enema's & the other a silly duel between Van Helsing & Dracula about who has to have the last word . Director Brooks uses loads of ancient gags & jokes from silly accents to moronic slapstick like where Dracula rises from his coffin & hits his head on a low hanging chandelier , hey this is classy sophisticated stuff . To it's credit the film looks really good & it has great sets , costumes , special effects & period production design . Apparently the dialogue in Dracula : Dead and Loving It spoofs a lot of the dialogue from the original Dracula ( 1931 ) with Bela Lugosi , well that's fine if you've seen the original Dracula which I haven't & I'm sure many other people haven't either so I have to ask myself what was the point when there was always going to a large amount of viewers who haven't seen the original Dracula , it seems like a bit of a waste & an in-joke a lot of people weren't going to get . Brooks goes for comedy all the way so forget about any scares . Technically Dracula : Dead and Loving It is pretty darn good but this aspect of things only leads to more frustration when one thinks what this film could have been , as someone who has sat through loads of low budget horror I could only think what the likes of Hammer could have done with a budget like this . The acting wasn't anything special & everyone plays it over-the-top , I must say that I personally thought Nielsen was awful as Dracula & had little screen presence . Dracula : Dead and Loving It is a comedy that isn't very funny & a horror that has no horror , it fails at everything it tries to do . It's not a totally worthless film as it's quite nice to look at & it has a strong story thanks to the original source but as a whole it didn't work for me .
497458	1355507	56875	4.0	Early horror gore film which has a certain charm .	A woman taking a bath is stabbed in the eye by mad Egyptian cultist Fuad Ramses ( Mal Arnold ) who runs a shop called ' Fuad Ramses exotic caterer ' . He then cuts her leg off with a machete , the water in the bath remains remarkably blood free , he puts her leg in a bag and leaves . Detective Pete Thornton ( Thomas Wood or William Kerwin , whatever his real name is ) and his Captain , Frank ( Scott H . Hall ) are both baffled by a series of brutal murders of young women who have each had a body part removed . Unfortunately these guys aren't too bright and claim they don't have any clues as to who the killer is , even though Ramses commits his crimes without gloves and in broad daylight . Mrs . Dorothy Fremont ( Lyn Bolton ) visits Ramses shop and hires him to prepare the food for a special party for her daughter Suzette ( Connie Mason ) . More victims turn up , a girl on a beach has her brains removed , while another unwilling donor has her tongue torn out . The police ( all two of them ! ) are still totally clueless and baffled . Ramses plans to resurrect an ancient Egyptian goddess named ' Ishtar ' . As his plan nears completion he needs one final willing sacrifice , and guess what ? Who better than pretty , young Suzette ? ! Her only hope is that the police stop him before he can conduct his ritualistic ' Blood Feast ' ! Directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis on his usual budget of next to nothing . Blood Feast is commonly regarded as the first ' gore ' film ever made . That may be so but it doesn't make it any good , does it ? Poor in just about every department , the acting is all over the place . Either people are just plain awful or overact like mad , Thomas Wood's surname sums up his acting style very well ! Scott H . Hall , Connie Mason and the guy from the beach whose girlfriend had her brains hacked out are just plain terrible . Mal Arnold as Ramses overacts wildly , staring into the camera and delivering his lines like you won't believe . You really have to see these performances to believe them . Photography , sets , sound , music and special effects are all poor . Talking of the effects there's plenty of them , their fun in a bad way , but not very convincing . The tongue Ramses pulls out of one victims mouth is about a foot long ! The script by Allison Louise Downe is at least pacey and thankfully short , the film clocks in at a modest 67 minutes . There is also a great line at the end which I loved , after Ramses is killed in a waste disposal truck Frank the police Captain says " he died a fitting death for the garbage he was ! " . These cops are the most stupid in film history , or at least they come very close . Their logic and thought process in regard to the murders and trying to solve them is absolutely hilarious . These films hold a certain fascination for horror fans like myself but are very difficult to recommend to casual viewers , but I did have some fun watching it , and it has a certain silly , goofy and almost innocent charm .
497822	1355507	681820	4.0	OK Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Physician , Heal Thyself starts as seventeen year old Julie Reed ( Tara Buckman ) staggers into the Bennett Clinic where she ask's for an abortion , highly experienced & well respected Dr . Ronald Shafer ( John Dehner ) performs the abortion as requested but Julie dies on the operating table . Julie's parents contact Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) in order to arrange a private autopsy which they will pay for , Asten gives the case to Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who notices that the abortion wasn't done very well . He decides to investigate further & subsequently finds out that Dr . Shafer has a drink problem & regularly turns up to work to perform vital operations & surgical procedures drunk , outraged Quincy is determined to stop him before he kills anyone else but it isn't as easy as he first thought it would be . . . Episode 18 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Corey Allen & is one of those largely moralistic Quincy episodes where he finds himself on some sort of crusade against bureaucracy , red tape , inadequate laws , incompetence & unhelpful people in authority . He pretty much takes on the whole system as usual . The themes here in Physician , Heal Thyself are rather standard issues dealing with alcohol problems & people make life & death decisions letting the alcohol rule their lives & therefore putting others at risk . There's also a stab at trying to say that keeping your mouth shut when you know someone who turns up for work drunk isn't good , which it isn't . It ends on a anti drink message which most will probably laugh at . It also points out some inadequacies in the law like usual & it's all rather familiar & routine feeling . There's nothing here amazing or overly enthralling either , it's OK I suppose & if you like these moralistic Quincy episodes then you may enjoy it but for most of us this isn't exactly going to knock our socks off . A largely talkative & exposition based episode nothing of any real note happens , there's no murder ( technically there isn't ) & no mystery which doesn't help . It's just a bland fifty minutes of preaching more than anything else , sure it's always fun to watch Quincy run around getting angrier & angrier at people as he fights red tape & bureaucracy but that can only entertain to a certain extent . The acting is OK & Quincy gets to gatecrash a posh country golf club . Physician , Heal Thyself is a standard fairly dull moralistic Quincy episode that fans will probably like but more casual viewers may find the going a little slow .
499104	1355507	490527	4.0	Not very good .	The Thirst starts as exotic dancer Lisa ( Clare Kramer ) is taken to hospital after falling ill on stage , she has terminal cancer but hasn't told her boyfriend Maxx ( Matt Keesler ) although it's not long before he finds out & is slightly annoyed that she didn't tell him . Maxx is depressed , Lisa is depressed & things just aren't looking great . As a potential solution Lisa decides to commit suicide because , you know , that would cheer everyone up wouldn't it ? Maxx is understandably upset , he & a couple of his buddies decide to pay a visit to an S & M club called Inferono where he thinks he sees Lisa . Going back the next night he manages to catch up with her & it is indeed Lisa , unfortunately she's now a bloodsucking Vampire who hangs around with other bloodsucking Vampires who kill people . Lisa manages to convince the head Vampire guy Darius ( Jeremy Sisto ) to spare Maxx & let him become one of them which he does , however being a bloodsucking Vampire isn't as fun as it sounds . . . Co-written & directed by Jeremy Kasten this Vampire flick has a fair amount of blood & gore but little else by which to recommend it . The script by Kasten , Ben Lustig , Liz Maccie , Wayne Mahon & Mark A . Altman ( it took five people to write this ? ! ? ! ) is more or less a Near Dark ( 1987 ) rip-off although while Near Dark had great character's , acting & writing The Thirst clearly & most definitely doesn't . The plot feels pretty bad & unoriginal , it's not any fun to watch apart from some over-the-top gore scenes & it neither interested me or drew me in to the action . The character's are poor as is the dialogue & there's nothing here we haven't seen dozens of times before . It moves along at a nice enough pace & isn't overly boring but there was just something about it , something dull which meant I just couldn't get into the story or action . I certainly didn't think it was anything special & I think by the end of the week I'd have completely forgotten about it . Director Kasten does alright but I thought the film lacked energy or any sort of atmosphere & it certainly isn't scary . There are pleasing amounts of gore & the filmmakers use old fashion prosthetic make-up effects rather than CGI computer effects but most of it is pretty much the same with huge sprays of blood coming from people's wounds , there's some guts here as well , someone gets a finger in the side of their head , there are shots of the remains of cats that have been torn to pieces , someone gets a lamp shoved down their throat & several people get their throats ripped out but the blood looks a bit watery & once you have seen one huge spray of arterial blood you've frankly seen them all . There is also a fair amount of nudity & naked female breasts if that sort of thing interests you although none of the actresses are anything special in the looks department . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 The Thirst had a bigger budget than I was expecting & personally I'd have liked to have seen a bit more on screen action for that sort of cash . The acting isn't anything to write home about & the cast aren't that good looking either . The Thirst is a below average Vampire horror flick , it's OK on a basic level but there's nothing memorable here beside some gory Vampire bite wounds . Worth a watch if your a Vampire junkie or die hard horror fan otherwise there's nothing much here of any worth .
497098	1355507	109592	4.0	Oh my God , can I have that 100 minutes of my life back . . . please ?	Dellamorte Dellamore , or Cemetery Man as it's also known amongst English speaking audiences , is set in the small Italian town of Buffalora where Francesco Dellamorte ( Rupert Everett ) is the caretaker of the local graveyard , recently within seven days of being buried the dead have been returning to life & Francesco has to kill them again this time for good . The rest of the plot is none existent & defies logical explanation . . . This Italian , French & German co-production was produced & directed by Michele Soavi & one has to say I've rarely seen a film with such a disregard for any sort of plot . The script by Gianni Romoli was based on a novel of the same name by Tiziano Sclavi originally published in Italy in 1991 , I'd genuinely struggle to call it a coherent script mind as it resembles an odd collection of bizarre ideas all jumbled together with absolutely no regard for continuity , story , plot , character's or the poor audience who has to sit through it . It's certainly strange with decapitated talking zombie heads , retarded sidekicks , three different people who look exactly the same , blue hovering lights , zombie boy-scouts , the likeness of death formed from telephone book pages & an ending which will make you question whether it was part of the same film you just spent nearly two hours watching . I like films where you have to think , I like films which leaves things open to interpretation & I like films which have hidden , deep & meaningful messages . In this respect I point towards the films of Canadian director David Cronenberg like Videodrome ( 1983 ) , Dead Rigers ( 1988 ) , Crash ( 1996 ) & eXistenZ ( 1999 ) to name a few examples . However unlike Cronenberg's work which can still be enjoyed on many levels in Dellamorte Dellamore there's absolutely rhyme or reason behind any of the confusing & just plain bizarre things that happen , there's no cohesive narrative , things just happen for no reason , people just come & go & it's an extremely frustrating & annoying film to watch unless your a member of the pretentious art-house crowd who lap this stuff up . To give him some credit where it's due director Soavi turns in a gorgeous looking film , the imagery on show is very stylish & almost every frame of every shot is carefully composed . It looks great but it's still a crap film that I had an extremely hard time watching , I really wanted to just turn it off & do something fun like watch the grass in my garden grow . I stuck it out though so never let it be said I don't give a film a chance . The gore was sort of disappointing too , after hearing good things about graphic gore there was a distinct lack of it to my eyes . There's several gunshot wounds to the head like Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) & Day of the Dead ( 1985 ) including a nun getting a bullet right in the eye , there's a shot of a bus running over someones head , there are some zombies , a decapitated talking zombie head which ends up flying through the air & biting someones neck just like the hilarious scene in Zombi 3 ( 1988 ) & nothing else really . There's some nudity as well both for the boy's & girls . With a supposed budget of about $4 , 000 , 000 Dellamorte Dellamore absolutely bombed everywhere it went theatrical & considering how abstract , oddball , offbeat , weird & about as far from mainstream as you can get it's no surprise whatsoever . Shot in Italy I'm not sure why Rupert Everett agreed to be in this , at least he got some credibility back as an actor from his role in Ispector Gadget ( 1999 ) ! The acting sucks , I hated everyone especially the ugly deformed retarded fatso sidekick who threw on on a girl yet she still wanted to marry him . Dellmorte Dellamore is one of those films your going to love or hate , as far as I'm concerned you can stick me in the hate camp . I have no idea why but it's become a bit of a cult item & isn't it generally true films with big cult followings almost always turn out to be rubbish & / or disappointing ? Not for me at all I'm afraid & I'll give it 1 star for the film itself & another couple for it's stylish good looks , there's a place for DVD's like Dellamorte Dellamore & it's called eBay !
497059	1355507	443450	4.0	" Dead or alive Cold is dangerous . " Poor Steven Seagal thriller .	Black Dawn starts at a Federal Prison in Utah where rouge CIA agent & nuclear weapons expert ( ! ) Jonathan Cold ( Steven Seagal , also producer ) breaks international arms dealer Michael Donovan ( Julian Stone ) out . Impressed with Cold's efficient work Donovan offers him a job , a job to oversee his buying a new nuclear weapon from some crazy scientist dude & obtaining the plutonium to power it . Jump to Los Angeles where the deal is to take place & where CIA agent & Cold's friend Amanda Stuart ( Tamara Davies ) has Donovan's brother James ( John Pyper-Ferguson ) under surveillance , however when she is caught by Donovan's men Cold has to blow his cover & rescue her . Now the Donovan's have plans for a nuclear weapon & the equipment to build it that they intend to sell to a bunch of Russian suicide bombers who intend to become marters when they blow Los Angeles up , that is unless one-man army Cold can stop them . . . Directed by Alexander Gruszynski this was actually a sequel to Seagal's terrible earlier straight-to-video / DVD action thriller The Foreigner ( 2003 ) a couple of years previous in which he played CIA agent Jonathan Cold racing across Europe with a deadly package , so Black Dawn which is titled The Foreigner 2 in some countries moves the story to the US & is the sequel no-one wanted . The plot is short on action & Seagal fans looking forward to some of his trademark martial arts fights will be disappointed as there isn't any , the too complex for it's good plot is all over the place , completely fails to engage or grip & is pretty standard action thriller fare without much action or many thrills . There's this really dumb twist at the end when some guy we have only seen once is revealed to be behind it or something yet for some reason he is there to start the bomb & kill the Russian terrorists , why not just let the Russians start the bomb & blow themselves up & like just make sure your out of Los Angeles well in advance ? Why stick around to potentially be blown up in a nuclear holocaust ? If Donovan was going to double cross the Russians why was he so bothered about finding the real plutonium ? Just give them vials of water or something , how would they know ? Open them up & have a taste ? I don't think so . The pace is alright & it keeps moving along but the plot is weak , predictable & the character's are forgettable . The action is pretty poor apart from a reasonable car chase involving a huge dumper truck which is quite good & probably belongs in a better film than Black Dawn . The only fight scene in Black Dawn sees one of the worst body doubles ever stand in for Seagal who is fat in this , in fact he is really fat & out of shape in this . This fight is filmed so you never see Cold's face but the stunt doubles body is all wrong & you can just tell it's not Seagal . Other than that it's just a fairly dull succession of shoot-outs between people . There's a big CGI computer effects explosion at the end but if it really was a nuclear bomb there would have been an electro magnetic pulse which would have shut down all electrical equipment including the helicopter Seagal was flying & thus send him crashing into the Ocean but Black Dawn isn't that concerned with factual accuracy . With a supposed budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 Black Dawn looks alright , it's a little flat & forgettable but the production values are decent enough . The acting isn't great from no-one of any interest & Seagal again seems dubbed a lot of the time . Black Dawn is a poor action thriller that fails to deliver on any count , it's dull & boring & utterly forgettable . Not quite as bad as The Foreigner but not too far behind it .
498719	1355507	95215	4.0	Nothing special .	Ghost Town starts as Kate Barrett ( Catherine Hickland ) drives along an isolated desert road , her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching . . . Deputy Sheriff Langley ( Frank Luz ) of Riverton County is called in to investigate Kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing . He finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her , unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk . Langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town , much to his shock Langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents & is run by the evil Devlin ( Jimmie F . Skaggs ) who has kidnapped Kate for reasons never explained & it's up to Langley to rescue her & end the towns curse . . . The one & only directorial effort of Richard Governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & I didn't like it all that much . The script by Duke Sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect . Have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there ? Well , neither have I but if I were to ask myself such a question I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it's not very good . The two genres just don't mix that well . There are plenty of clichés , on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them , the shoot-outs in the main street , saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs , some ghosts , an ancient curse , talking corpses & a few violent kills . I was just very underwhelmed by it , I suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well . There are a few holes in the plot too , why did Devlin kidnap Kate ? I know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway ? We never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either , I mean what's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts ? Then there's the bit at the end where Devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for Langley to kill him a few seconds later , I mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place ? Director Governor does alright , there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard Hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it . I wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't , there's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length . Forget about any gore , there a few bloody gunshot wounds , an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that's it . I'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here , it's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else . Credit where credit's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually . The acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards . Ghost Town is a strange film , I'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me . Anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements . It's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good , worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it .
498973	1355507	118643	5.0	Not too bad .	The Prophecy II is set in Los Angeles & starts as nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) runs over a young man named Danyael ( Russell Wong ) , taking him to hospital she makes sure he's OK . Valerie visits Danyael again & they fall for each other , before you know it they are in bed together & have sex which Valerie quickly learns has left her pregnant . If that wasn't bad enough an evil archangel Gabriel ( Christophere Walken ) is out to kill her since Danyael was in fact an angel & their child will unite heaven as told in a prophecy which the evil Daniel doesn't want because he wants to rule heaven himself & destroy Earth in the process . Valerie must stay alive long enough to raise her child or both heaven & Earth will be destroyed , now that's pressure . . . Co-written & directed by Greg Spence I thought The Prophecy II was a decent time waster but nothing particularly special . The script by Spence & associate producer Matt Greenberg is fairly exposition heavy & has some interesting ideas but it's a bit slow even at less than 90 minutes & is sometimes a little hard to follow . I admit that I have never seen the original The Prophecy ( 1995 ) & as such I didn't have a clue what was going on for the first half of this film , this is a sequel where it is advisable that you have seen the original because if your anything like me you'll spend the first half wondering who everyone is what the hell's going on , I mean there's an early scene where some guy in a long coat touches the ground of some parking lot & then cracks in the ground open & Christopher Walken's character emerges & I sat there & thought to myself ' what just happened there & who was that guy ? ' neither of which are satisfactorily explained . There are various religious ideas & themes with horror & supernatural overtones & elements here as one would expect in a film about angels & while they are OK they never really engage or interest that much & are fairly forgettable . I liked the notion that an angel didn't know how to drive or what a computer is with Christopher Walken not even knowing how to use a gun . If you like religious themed horror them you'll almost certainly like The Prophecy II but if you don't then , like me , it may not do too much for you . Director Spence does a good job & the film has a great sense of style , there's some nice colour schemes going on as well . There are a few eerie moments but I wouldn't say it's particularly scary , it does have a nice atmosphere though . There's not much gore on show , there are a couple of ripped out hearts , a few impalings & a messed up body on an autopsy table . Some of it's a bit silly , I mean I don't know how Valerie survives falling off the top of that building , Gabriel's body wouldn't have been enough to break the fall & even if it was why wasn't she impaled on the spike along with him ? By the way if your interested the IMDb has spelt Danyael's name wrong in their ' Plot Outline ' on the main page . . . Going straight-to-video this probably had a decent budget & it show's , it's well made & pretty stylish with it . The special effects are good & the acting is alright with Christopher Walken stealing every scene he's in , the guy is just a great actor . The Prophecy II is an alright religious themed supernatural horror thriller , it's worth a watch but it's nothing special . This was enough of a success to spawn three further sequels , The prophecy 3 : The Ascent ( 2000 ) , The Prophecy : Uprising ( 2005 ) & The Prophecy : Forsaken ( 2005 ) .
497791	1355507	95631	5.0	Didn't do much for me at all .	Midnight Run starts in Los Angeles where ex-Chicago cop Jack Walsh ( Robert De Niro ) works as a bounty hunter looking for & capturing criminals who have jumped bail & then collect the reward from bondsman Eddie Moscone ( Joe Pantoliano ) , Jack doesn't like it but it's a living . Eddie ask's Jack to find ex-accountant Jonathan ' the Duke ' Mardukas ( Charles Grodin ) who stole fifteen million dollars from a Las Vegas mobster named Jimmy Serrano ( Dennis Farina ) & has run out on Eddie owing him $450 , 000 in bail money . Eddie needs the Duke back within five days , Jack accepts the job & finds the Duke in New York but getting him back to Los Angeles turns out to more difficult than Jack had thought with the FBI , gangsters & rival bounty hunters on their tails . . . Produced & directed by Martin Brest ( who also has a small cameo in the film as the Airline ticket clerk at Las Vegas ) I notice that Midnight Run seems to be a very popular film which I can't relate to at all , in fact I think it's average at best & boring rubbish at worst . The script by George Gallo takes the buddy buddy mismatched partners thrown into some comedy crime caper action thriller template & turns it into a staggeringly uneventful two hours . I am sorry but to me the vast majority of Midnight Run is just bland chit chat between Walsh & the Duke as lots of other interested parties chase them across America . A lot of films use the whole mismatched partner thing & use it to create tensions , be it racial tension as in Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) or class tension as in Tango & Cash ( 1989 ) & here in Midnight Run it's the whole criminal vs lawman type tensions . The action scenes are poor & don't live too long in the memory . The script also likes to throw in profanity at every opportunity just for the hell of it , it seems almost every second word is a swear word & while I have nothing against profanity the sheer amount of it in Midnight Run smacks of swearing for swearing's sake . The character's are also poor , we hardly ever find anything out about the Duke , Walsh comes across better but then it's clichés all the way with the typical Las Vegas mobster , the FBI man who Walsh manages to stay one step ahead of all the time & the rival bounty hunter who just can't quite get the better of Walsh . With lots of people chasing around after each I was expecting some sort of huge climax but even that is low key & forgettable . Also I thought Walsh tracked the Duke down rather easily , I mean the FBI couldn't find him , Las Vegas gangsters couldn't find him but little old Jack Walsh could . In the space of a single day too . Director Brest was obviously hired by Paramount to make another comedy action thriller in the vein of his previous film Beverly Hills Cop ( 1984 ) , which coincidentally also contains a foul mouthed cop character , & wanted to cast Cher as Mardukas , & then Robin Williams but Brest hired Grodin against the studios wishes & Paramount dropped the film with Universal then stepping in to take over production . Apparently Bruce Willis was considered for the Mardukas role but was turned down & as such he went on to make Die Hard ( 1988 ) , both films opened on the same weekend & it's fair to say Willis would have the last laugh . The action scenes really are forgettable , there's a crashing helicopter , an average car chase & that's it . With a supposed budget of about $30 , 000 , 000 Midnight Run is well made for what it is but most of it is rather talky for my tastes . The acting is alright , De Niro is just a fine actor anyway but I thought Grodin was poor & uncharismatic . Midnight Run is an average buddy buddy mismatched partner type comedy crime caper , I can't say I hated it but I can't say I loved it either . Followed by three made-for-telly sequels , Another Midnight Run ( 1994 ) , Midnight Runaround ( 1994 ) & Midnight Run for Your Life ( 1994 ) .
497632	1355507	352220	5.0	Despite it not being very good I thought it had a few things going for it .	The Brink starts in ' West Orange , NJ 1931 ' as inventor Thomas Edison's ( Monty Wall ) latest creation has unexpected consequences . . . Jump forward to the present day where engineering student Megan ( Rachel Blazer ) has tracked down the schematics for Edison's invention which supposedly brings ghosts into our world , Megan convinces two of her student friends Bianca ( Heather Chase ) & Todd ( Jason Flowers ) to help her build the machine which they agree to . They set themselves up in an old abandoned & isolated farmhouse 50 miles from anywhere of note & get to work , they quickly discover that Megan's ex boyfriend Leo ( Jeff Ryan ) has joined the party as the ' voice of reason ' . Together they build the machine & turn it on at which point a ghostly figure ( Matt Miller ) appears holding an axe which it then uses to try & kill Todd , whoever said ghosts were friendly . . . Edited , photographed , co-written , produced & directed by Benjamin Cooper I certainly didn't love The Brink but I saw some potential here & thought it was watchable if nothing else . The script by Cooper & John Bowker takes itself extremely seriously & is a little slow to get going which it's main problem , films such as The Brink need to hit you hard straight away & keep you interested throughout , something which the makers of The Brink didn't do & it's over 40 minutes into the film before the four friends turn on the machine by which time it will have probably lost 75 % of it's audience who will have either turned it off & stuck Terminator 2 ( 1991 ) in the DVD player or switched it over to MTV . Hey , I'm all for a slow measured build up but this is ridiculous & quite frankly there's not that much to build up too ! The character's are OK actually & despite being of the teenage variety they didn't annoy me that much , the dialogue was alright & the basic story had potential especially a really neat twist towards the end which a lot more should have been made out of . Generally speaking The Brink isn't a particularly great film & I won't be in any hurry to see it again but there are one or two nice moments here & the story with it's twist had potential which unfortunately wasn't fully realised probably to the low budget & technical restrictions . Director Cooper does a decent job & I have to say The Brink actually looks like a proper film as opposed to a glorified home movie which is how I think a lot of recently made low budget shot on a camcorder type horror junk that litters video shop shelves look . I wouldn't say it's particularly scary but there are one or two atmospheric moments dotted throughout , there's a distinct lack of gore & violence as well . Someone gets her head sliced in half horizontally with an axe accompanied by a sound effect that resembles someone stepping in some mud & there's a chopped off hand but nothing else worth mentioning . I'm not sure what sort of budget The Brink had but I'll bet it was pretty low so bear that in mind , at least it's reasonably well made & watchable if nothing else . The Brink has a similar storyline to White Noise ( 2005 ) & even though it was apparently shot 2 years before White Noise came out The Brink was released straight-to-video / DVD after . The acting was OK but nothing special . The Brink was better than I had expected although to be honest that wasn't going to be hard , I can't really recommend it as my head tells me it's a terrible film but my heart says otherwise . I'll leave this one up to you & give it a middle of the road .
498908	1355507	95454	5.0	Not too bad but not exactly great either , an OK time waster .	The Kiss starts with a caption that informs us that we are in the ' Belgian Congo 1963 ' at a train station . A young girl named Felice Dunbar ( Priscilla Mouzakiotis ) is being sent away by her Father ( Philip Pretten ) with her Aunt Irene ( Celine Lomez ) while her sister Hilary ( Talya Rubin ) stays behind with him . On the journey Irene shows Felice an ancient tribal statue of some sort , not long after Irene's rotted corpse is found . . . The Kiss then informs us that it's ' 25 Years Later Albany New York ' . Hilary ( Pamela Collyer ) is now married to Jack Halloran ( Nicholas Kilbertus ) & together they have & beautiful teenage daughter named Amy ( Meredith Salenger ) . One day out of the blue Hilary receives a phone call from her sister Felice ( Joanna Pacula ) & they both arrange to meet , however on the way Hilary is killed in an accident . It's now ' 5 Months Later ' & while visiting Hilary's grave Amy & her Father meet Felice , after they find out who she is Jack invites her to stay at their house . Amy starts to distrust & dislike Felice as one of her friends named Heather ( Sabrina Boudot ) dies in another bizarre accident & Felice seduces Jack . Amy's suspicions grow when she discovers a strange statue & Heather's sunglasses in Felice's room . More accidents happen & Felice becomes weirder & weirder until all is revealed when Amy realises she is about to become heir to a horrifying family secret & she has to fight for her life against The Kiss . . . Co-produced & directed by Pen Densham I thought The Kiss was a mildly entertaining horror film but nothing that was particularly special in any way shape or form . The script by Tom Ropelewski & Stephen Volk is reasonably well paced , it has one or two slightly slow points but it's not too bad . The script doesn't really try to explain what's going on that much , no explanation for the origins of the statue , the eventual creature or the psycho cat . The Kiss also suffers from the usual silliness one associates with the horror genre , the scene with the propane tank at the end is unrealistic to say the least & this daftness affects The Kiss at times because the film seems to be taking itself quite seriously . There is some gore in it , a burnt hand , a rotten corpse , death by escalator , scissors stuck in someones neck & a couple of nasty car accidents including one with a juicy severed leg . I did like the special effects sequence when Amy is in science class at school & the anatomy dummy comes to life with it's exposed beating heart & lungs , cool eh ? The special effects are OK , except that is the killer psycho cat which looks very fake & somewhat silly throughout I'm afraid . The fine looking Pacula provides the nudity . The acting in The Kiss is adequate by horror film standards although I thought Pacula as the main villain should have had a bit more of an on screen presence . The Kiss is quite well made , nothing stands out as being technically brilliant but nothing stands out as being overly bad either . Generally speaking Densham films The Kiss in a rather bland & uninteresting way which isn't a great surprise I suppose . Overall I thought The Kiss was an OK way to pass an hour & a half but I'll have probably forgotten all about it by the middle of next week , just about worth watching but don't expect a masterpiece .
497908	1355507	650870	5.0	Decent enough Monsters episode featuring a monster .	Monsters : Rouse Him Not starts as painter Linda McGuire ( Laraine Newman ) is visited by a man named John Thunston ( Alex Cord ) who is writing an article about local legends & superstitions & Linda's house that she moved into six weeks ago is top of his list of hot spots . While looking for Linda's dog Hardy in the cellar they notice a large hole in the floor which was done by a workman not long previous & that a star shaped pentagram painted on the floor had been destroyed . Then soon after a large slimy monster rises from the hole in search of fresh blood . John decides to stick around & help rid Linda of her unwanted guest using his trusty silver sword . . . Episode eleven from season one of Mosters this originally aired in the US during December 1988 , directed by special make-up effect's artist Mark Shostrom this is a decent enough way to pass twenty odd minutes but there isn't much to it & it feels like a short promo reel for horror film to attract finance rather than an episodic entry in an anthology series . I mean where's the twist ? The script was based on a story by fantasy author Manly Wade Wellman & is a fairly straight forward tale about a monster that is freed from it's tomb after someone moves into a house & releases it by accident . Not that much else happens , there's some religious nonsense about Witchcraft & a silver sword made by an English Saint but the only reason anyone is watching Rouse Him Not is for the monster & it doesn't feature too often & when it does it doesn't have much to do . Rouse Him Not is alright I suppose but there are better Monsters episodes out there & the lack of any twist doesn't help . Oh , one more thing , what happened to Hardy the dog ? Everyone seemed to forget about it rather quickly & we never find out it's fate , dog's have feelings as well you know . Like usual the main point of interest in this Monsters episode is the actual monster itself which in this case is a tall slimy horned demon thing which looks quite impressive & that's where most of the budget went probably . Like most Monsters episodes there's only two sets to it's quite contained & there's only three people in it including veteran TV actor Alex Cord who I best remember from his limping , white suit , eye-patch wearing role in the cheesy TV action series Airwolf ( 1984 - 1986 ) . Rouse Him Not is a watchable enough Monsters episode but it's not one of the best & it's more of a short horror film than a anthology style short with a twist ending . Not too bad but not great , fans of the show should like it .
499068	1355507	373883	5.0	Re : the Unrated Director's Cut . Rather long & uneventful remake .	Halloween starts in Haddonfield , Illinois on October 31 where abused & psychologically disturbed 10 year old child Michael Myers ( Daeg Faerch ) goes postal & murders his stepfather Ronnie ( William Forsythe ) , his sister Judith ( Hanna Hall ) & her boyfriend Steve ( Adam Weisman ) not necessarily in that order . Michael is convicted of murder & incarcerated in Smiths Grove Sanitarium & treated under the supervision of Dr . Samuel Loomis ( Malcolm McDowell ) . Jump forward fifteen years later & Michael hasn't said a word in that time , he is now just an empty shell of pure hatred & evil . Two guards attempt to rape a female patient late one night & Michael is given an opportunity to escape which he happily takes killing anyone who tries to stop him . Michael heads back for Haddonfield where he intends to find & kill his last remaining relative Laurie Strode ( Scout Taylor-Compton ) who is blissfully unaware that she even has a brother . . . Written , co-produced & directed by Rob Zombie ( real name Robert Cummings ) this remake of John Carpenter's widely considered classic Halloween ( 1978 ) continues the recent trend of Hollywood studios remaking classic horror films such as Dawn of the Dead ( 2004 ) , The Fog ( 2005 ) , The Hills Have Eyes ( 2006 ) , Black Christmas ( 2006 ) , The Wicker Man ( 2006 ) & The Hitcher ( 2007 ) to name but a few of the more recent ones . These remakes are a bit of a mixed bag some being great while others are plain terrible & I would say in my opinion the Halloween remake is somewhere between the two , I didn't like it that much but I didn't flat out hate it either . Like most films are these days Halloween went to theatres as an ' R ' rated version & subsequently released on DVD shortly after in an ' Unrated ' director's cut which not only lasts for twenty minutes longer but has many scenes changed & altered including Michael's prison break which is totally different in the two versions to the extent even different actor's were used in the sequence . Carpenter's original Halloween is considered by many as one of the finest tension filled slasher films ever , it's simple basic self contained story of a psychopath out to kill Laurie . With the remake Zombie has decided to go into Michael's head & give him lots of background & reasoning behind what he does & who he is which I must confess bored me . These explanations offer nothing new or any sort of significant motivation other than he had a difficult childhood . The first forty odd minutes of Halloween sets the Michael character up , the protracted killing of his family , scenes of his treatment & breakout . Carpenter's efficient & economic original did the same in less than half that time . I didn't like the character's that much , Laurie in particular was very annoying & by the end I was rooting for Michael & hoped he would just kill her if not just to stop her irritating screaming . Director Zombie goes the modern route & instead of nice long establishing shots & camera moves there's plenty of quick cuts & shaky hand held camera movement . Not overly pleasant to watch . It's undoubtedly well made but it's shallow , forgettable & at just under two hours far too long & drawn out . It's always a bad sign when you are sitting watching a film & you keep repeating ' please just finish ' in your mind for the last thirty minutes . There's some blood splatter but not much actual gore , there's an impressively bloody slit throat but little else . The nudity count is very high with Zombie never missing an opportunity to undress his actresses & show some breast . In fact he even kills two of his character's off while they are naked . It gives the film a certain sleazy & cheap feel which may be a recommendation for some on it's own . With a supposed budget of about $20 , 000 , 000 Halloween is well made with good production values but at the same time is almost instantly forgettable . There is nothing here for instance to match the long continuous point-of-view shot of Michael putting his mask on , walking through the house , picking up the knife & stabbing his sister as seen in the original . It was nice to hear the classic John Carpenter Halloween theme used here . The acting is alright & there are several familiar faces including McDowell , Brad Dourif , William Forsythe , Richard Lynch , Udo Kier , Clint Howard , Ken Foree & Danny Trejo who all should be familiar to seasoned horror flick fans . Halloween is an average slasher film under any title & in trying to pit itself against what many consider to be the finest slasher film ever ( not me though ) it was on a hiding to nothing before it was even released . A passable modern slasher flick but nothing else .
498176	1355507	366174	5.0	Better than the original , but that ain't saying much is it ?	Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid starts in New York City where company executive Gordon Mitchell ( Chesnut Morris ) is about to lose a huge contract as a pharmaceutical company is about to sever their ties with him , however scientist Dr . Jack Byron ( Matthew Marsden ) manages to convince the top brass that he has potentially discovered the pharmaceutical equivalent of the fountain of youth . A substance that could potentially prolong life , a substance taken from the rare Blood Orchid only found in Borneo & an Orchid which only blooms for 6 months every 7 years & the Orchid is only in bloom for a further two weeks . The top brass are convinced & excited about the prospect & an expedition is set up immediately , unfortunately it's rainy season & no respectable captain will take them so they hire renegade captain Bill Johnson ( Johnny Messner ) & his partner Tray ( Karl Yune ) to take them on their rickety old boat . Gordon , Dr . Byron & his assistant Sam Rogers ( KaDee Strickland ) , company representative Gail Stern ( Salli Richardson ) , team doctor Ben Douglas ( Nicholas Gonzalez ) & computer geek Cole Burris ( Eugene Byrd ) all set off on the long & perilous trip in search of the Orchid , however they must face & overcome plenty of obstacles including giant man-eating anacondas . . . Directed by Dwight H . Little Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is the sequel to the terrible Anaconda ( 1997 ) & is a big improvement but is still by no means a classic by any stretch of the imagination . The script by John Claflin , Daniel Zelman , Michael Miner & Ed Neumeier feels a lot like the original & just about any other giant monster on the loose film if you strip it down to it's most basic as it is pretty much exactly the same , a group of people on a old boat who become stuck in the middle of the jungle where a few insignificant character's are either crushed or eaten by an anaconda before the survivors kill it & sail off into the sunset happily ever after . As a result if you've seen the original there isn't much reason to sit through his , there are no surprises , there's as many clichés as you can shake a stick at particularly the character's . There's the usual bland mix of stereotypes like doctors , scientists , computer guys & the unorthodox hero who saves the day . The story itself has many problems like I could never figure out why they just don't ride in helicopters & it's not because there's nowhere to land as there are helicopters that can land on water , it would have been both quicker & safer . That spider is complete nonsense , why would the snake explode at the end , a lot of the so called facts are utter tosh & the anaconda is a South American species of snake not a South Asian one , anacondas don't live in Borneo - FACT . Having said that it moves along at a fair pace & if you don't go into it expecting too much than you may find it an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes . Director Little does an OK job but you can't help but feel that it's a little on the plain side , there isn't much in the way of shocks or scares & as a whole the film feels more like an adventure as the bulk of it focuses on the the teams attempts to get back to civilisation with the giant anacondas being an almost secondary consideration & a bit of an afterthought . Forget about any gore as there isn't any . With a supposed budget of $25 , 000 , 000 Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid has surprisingly poor special effects for a very modern film , the snake CGI didn't look that good to me . Shot in Fiji & New Zealand the film looks very samey with lots of green jungle which becomes tedious to look at after a while . The acting wasn't that great , does anyone else think Richardson looks like Jennifer Lopez a lot ? Butch hero Messner speaks with a funny voice throughout the entire thing that was supposed to make him sound hard . It doesn't . Byrd as Cole has to one of the most annoying actor / character I've seen in a while & to add insult to injury not only does he not die he actually saves the day at the end , urgh . Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is an OK film if you go into it with low enough expectations & at least it's a lot better than the original . Could have been better could have been worse .
496867	1355507	90190	5.0	Probably the best film Troma have made to date , that ain't saying much though . . .	The Toxic Avenger starts with a shot of the New York City skyline . A narration informs us that ' New York City , the worlds capital of culture & industry . Here , among the towering skyscraper's , civilisation is guided by men of progress & the wonders of technology . But for all this industrial advancement there is a price to pay . Pollution , the unavoidable byproduct of todays society , every year millions of gallons of poisonous wastes , garbage & radioactive chemicals are disposed of in nearby towns such as Tromaville the toxic waste dumping capital of the world . Our story takes place at the Tromaville health club where a young man named Melvin Furd ( forget what the IMDb says , it's definitely Furd not Junko ) works . Melvin's entire life , in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste . . . ' Melvin ( Mark Torgl ) is a real loser , nerd & all round wimp . Melvin is a mop boy at the the Tromaville health club & everyone makes fun of him , especially four local thugs named Bozo ( Gary Schneider ) his girlfriend Julie ( Cindy Manion ) plus Slug ( Robert Prichard ) & his girlfriend Wanda ( Jennifer Prichard as Jennifer Babtist ) . One day the four decide to play a cruel practical joke on Melvin & humiliate him in front of as many people as possible . However things go wrong , or right depending on whichever way you look at it I suppose , & Melvin ends up head first in a barrel of hazardous toxic waste . As a consequence Melvin mutates into the Toxic Avenger ( Mitch Cohen as Mitchell Cohen ) , wow . After saving an Irish cop named Officer O'Clancy ( Dick Martinsen ) from a gang of three thugs , Cigarface ( Dan Snow ) , Knuckles ( Doug Isbecque ) & Nipples ( Charles Lee Jr . ) Toxie discovers that he enjoyed being a hero & so decides to clean Tromaville up by single-handedly wiping out the evil forces which contaminate the town . Mayor Belgoody ( Pat Ryan as Pat Ryan Jr . ) is as bent as they come & starts to notice a drop in his profit margins from his illegal activity , he puts pressure on the Chief of police ( David N . Weiss as David Weiss ) to find the Toxic Avenger & kill him before Toxie finds & kills them . . . Directed by Micheal Herz & Lloyd Kaufman as Samuel Weil I thought The Toxic Avenger was one seriously brain-dead film made for idiots by idiots , you can take that anyway you like considering that I actually quite liked it . The script by Joe Ritter is as stupid as you can imagine , this thing makes the Police Academy films ( 1984 - 94 ) look like the pinnacle of sophistication ! The jokes are really dumb & moronic , furthermore it stretches the boundaries of acceptability & taste . The Toxic Avenger pokes fun at blind people , beating old ladies up , running children over & going back to crush their heads while later on in the film a woman masturbates over some photographs of the incident & putting a dwarf into a washing machine & turning it on . The sort of comedy you can expect in The Toxic Avenger isn't exactly classy either like someone putting a snake down a fitness instructors top & his class copying his silly movements as he tries to grab it or Toxie's blind girlfriend Sara ( Andree Maranda ) making him a sandwich filled with Draino . Subtle obviously isn't a word in director's Herz & Kaufman's vocabulary . There is some over-the-top violence & gore , a squashed head , ripped off arm , fried hands , shotgun blasted guide dogs , intestine ripping , beatings & a bit where a guy has his head crushed by some weights but it's all rather fake looking & presented in a slapstick sort of way . Tecnically The Toxic Avenger is awful , the acting is terrible as is the cinematography , editing as continuity obviously wasn't an important issue for the filmmakers & overall production values . There are some reasonable , if cheap looking , car stunts in a brief action sequence as well . Having said all that I did actually find some of it quite amusing ( I'm not sure what that say's about me ) & in a fun sort of way it , for the most part , works as a whole . It's very well paced , something is always happening whether it's an outrageous bad taste joke or just some good old fashioned violence & gore . I can't really recommend The Toxic Avenger as a good film but it did keep me entertained throughout & that's all I was hoping for , I mean I didn't expect high art , or an educational thought provoking study of modern society did I ? ! Fun , but an acquired taste & only for those with the stomach .
496965	1355507	430239	5.0	Dull creature feature .	It Waits starts in the Canadian wilderness deep in some forest where some cavers discover something nasty inside a newly found cave . . . Jump forward ' Two Months Later ' where forest ranger Danielle St . Claire ( Cerina Vincent ) is stuck in a watch tower on her own grieving for her dead friend who recently died in a car accident which she blames herself for , her friend & fellow forest ranger Justin Rawley ( Dominic Zamprogna ) joins her in an attempt to cheer her up & get into her bed . However they are not alone as an ancient winged creature terrorises them for reasons I have no idea about other than it's an evil creature & that's what evil creatures do for a living . . . Directed by Steven R . Monroe I thought It Waits was average at best . The script by Richard Christian Matheson , Thomas E . Szollosi & Stephen J . Cannell is rather ponderous & pedestrian , in fact the first 20 odd minutes absolutely nothing of merit happens & is a total snooze-fest . Once the creature turns up things begin to pick up although it seems to want to play games with the forest rangers & scare them although it could just as easily kill them & be done with it . We never really learn about the creature , what it is or where it came from . The character's are clichéd & dull , the dialogue isn't anything to write home about & I'll have forgotten everything about them by the end of today & I hated the boring back-story surrounding Danielle & her dead friend . This is also one of those films that spends a lot of time showing people running through a forest doing noting in particular , or that's how it felt . During the final 20 minutes the pace picks up & it becomes a half decent film although I thought it was too little too late . I don't know , I thought it was all very average , it could have been worse but it could have been better . Director Monroe does a decent job , the scenery is quite nice but but as I said there's too many shots of people walking around . There isn't much atmosphere probably because we know so little about the creature & barely see it until the end & there's no tension or proper scares either . One thing I can say about It Waits is that it has some decent if minor gore effects , while there isn't buckets of blood in it what's here is pretty good including an impalement where someone has a huge branch stuck up their bum in a scene that I'd imagine is a rip-off / homage / reference to Cannibal Holocaust ( 1980 ) , a decapitated head & their headless body & a couple of mutilated corpses . I think the gore could have been more plentiful but whats here is quite impressive . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 200 , 000 It Waits was a pretty well funded film , I have to say I'd have liked to have seen more for that sort of money . There's barely any actors in it , the special effects are used sparingly , there's no action scenes or explosions & it takes place in exactly the same location throughout so where did the money go ? I personally thought the acting was poor from everyone involved & the only character to stand out for me was Hoppy the Parrott , enough said . It Waits was average at best & a boring repetitive waste of time at worst , in reality I thought it was somewhere between the two . It's an OK way to pass the time but it's utterly forgettable & a tad dull if I'm honest .
498055	1355507	681740	5.0	" What's the matter Quincy ? You look like you've seen a ghost . " Average episode .	Quincy M . E . : A Ghost of a Chance starts as Harold Markham ( Tom Stuart ) goes under the surgeon's knife for what was meant to be a simple heart bypass procedure , however a few hours later Markham complains of intense chest pains & despite the doctor's best efforts dies shortly after . Harold's brother Ted ( Nicolas Coaster ) is unimpressed by heart surgeon Dr . Stanley Royce's ( Jose Ferrer ) explanation about complications & pays his 575 dollars and 18 cents to the county coroner's office so an autopsy can be performed to discover the truth , Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is on the case & finds out that the surgical technique used on Harold differs from the specialist procedure which Royce is well known for . Quincy believes that Harold was operated on by a ' ghost surgeon ' , an inexperienced intern as opposed to a qualified surgeon who was supposed to operate & in this case happens to be Royce an old friend of Quincy's . Quincy does all he can to uncover the truth & get justice for the Markham's . . . Episode 2 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & I must admit I'm starting to become a little bit concerned about season 8 even in this it's early stages because there has been two episodes & both have been pretty poor . I must admit that before I saw this episode I had never even heard the term ghost surgery , I mean I'd heard of ghost writing & Ghost Rider ( ! ) but not ghost surgery . To be brutally honest I don't particularly believe it's a problem , certainly not here in the UK & I just couldn't get into the story because I couldn't relate to it at all . Then there's the fact that I like Quincy when he's running around shouting at bureaucrat's & solving crimes both of which have been sadly lacking during the first two episodes of season 8 , in fact barely any screen time has been devoted to Quincy solving a crime . What we've been left with are two misjudged moralistic episodes which just don't work , I'm sorry but I'm a huge fan of the show & to me this just isn't Quincy & I hope the show gets back on track soon . This story is pretty predictable , has an inappropriate happy ending & comes across as rather dull . This episode looks alright , there are a couple of surgery scenes but nothing graphic . There's a bit more romance between Quincy & Emily as she show's him her none existent guitar playing skills & she gives a stupid psychological explanation to the story when Quincy asks her opinion . The acting here is alright with Star Trek : The Next Generation's ( 1987 - 1994 ) Jonathan Frakes making his second Quincy appearance having changed careers from a cocaine dealing murderer in The Face of Fear ( 1982 ) to a heart surgeon in this ! A Ghost of a Chance is an average Quincy episode at best , the always excellent Klugman still makes it a worthwhile watch for fans but a silly basic premise & a lack of crime solving means this episode isn't anything to shout about . Hopefully season 8 will improve .
497347	1355507	681799	5.0	Potentially good episode spoilt by a poor ending .	Quincy M . E . : Last Day , First Day starts as Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) introduces new trainee laboratory technician Harriett Bowlin ( Sarah Rush ) who has just arrived straight out of University , it's up to chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to show her the ropes . Meanwhile forensic pathologist of over thirty years Dr . Gill Moore ( Harry Townes ) comes under pressure from his drug dealing son Tony ( Bill Beyers ) to fix an autopsy on a guy named John Rubio to make it look like he died in a car accident rather than being murdered from a huge overdose of heroin by local mobsters . Tony says the people behind Rubio's murder will kill him if he doesn't fix the results , his father agrees & lies about the autopsy findings but since Bowlin took her own samples to process as experience his plan starts to fall apart . . . Episode 3 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Leslie Martinson & Last Day , First Day was a really good episode until the rushed ending which spoilt everything . I liked the setting inside the laboratory & that a crime is being committed there in the way that it was , I think it's different from any other episode in the show thus far & the character of Dr . Moore was quite well conceived as someone who has integrity but ultimately has to put his son first . There's a couple of assassins in here as well , a comedy subplot about Quincy making a fool of himself at a baseball game a few days earlier , a new trainee lab technician & a Rabai . There's a fair amount going on & I suppose it's no great surprise that the production team run out of time & just when you think Dr . Moore , the assassins & Tony are all going to be exposed & caught the episode shifts to Danny's with all the regulars sitting around a table for thirty seconds of exposition where Quincy says the killers were caught & Moore lost his job which is a rather rushed & unsatisfactory way to finish the episode off after I had invested the best part of fifty odd minutes in the character's & the story . How annoying . Worth watching for sure but the rushed ending just doesn't feel right & the plot doesn't feel like it has any closure . There's a really bizarre car crash at the start of this episode which in reality would be impossible , for a start the car is pushed over the edge of a cliff & it explodes in mid air without actually touching or crashing into anything . How did that happen exactly ? Then the driver Rubio who is already dead is thrown from the wreck even though neither doors open & I also think he would have been toast since the car blew up as soon as it left the cliff edge . How did that happen exactly ? The two bumbling killers suspect that the seat beat broke . How ? Seat belts just don't break . Car doors don't just fly open for no reason . The whole sequence is very clumsily put together & thought out . Harry Townes makes the third of his four guest appearances on Quincy each time playing a doctor although different doctor's . Pete the security guard fans should take note he probably has his biggest ever role in Last Day , First Day . The acting is alright but all that painfully fake laughter at the photo slides of Quincy trying to play baseball sounds really bad & forced . Last Day , First Day was going really well until the last two minutes in which the makers try to tie everything that has happened in the episode up in the space of one thirty second conversation at Danny's & needless to say they don't pull it off satisfactorily .
498203	1355507	82804	5.0	Fairly entertaining haunted house horror film .	Lauren Cochran ( Robin Groves ) is a writer who lives in New York City and lately has been suffering from anxiety attacks , which her Doctor , Webb ( Patrick Farrelly ) put down to a condition called agoraphobia , which is a fear of leaving the house . Lauren decides to escape Manhattan and head to a small town called Dover Falls to finish her current novel . Her friend Mark Felton ( Christopher Loomis ) drives her to Dover Falls . They stop by the side of the road , take a break and stretch their legs . Lauren comes across an unusual large octagonal house that she feels she knows . It's exactly the same house she wrote about in one of her previous books entitled ' The Nesting ' . And that the cover illustration on the book that she described for the artist to draw is precisely the same as this house she is looking at now , even though she has never been there before . She immediately decides to rent the property . She makes arrangements with the house's owner , a Colonel Lebrun ( John Carradine ) and his grandson Daniel Griffith ( Micheal David Lally ) and moves in straight away . That night Lauren has a dream about the house , or was it a hallucination or possibly even ghosts ? While visiting , Dr . Webb has an ' accident ' and is killed . The local handyman Frank Beasley ( Bill Rowley ) is mysteriously drowned after trying to attack Lauren . More strange things happen , record players start on their own , words are mysteriously typed onto her work and Lauren continues to see strange people who seem able to just appear and disappear at will . She decides to investigate the house's history , and talks with a local farmer called Abner Welles ( David Tabor ) who becomes violent towards her when questioned about the house . Lauren becomes more and more unsure if what she has experienced is real , hallucinatory or if indeed there are ghosts inhabiting the house . Co-written and directed by Armand Weston I thought this was a decent enough haunted house horror film . The script by Weston and Daria Price takes quite a long time to establish the situation and is fairly slow going at times . But I have to say it kept me pretty interested and watching right through to the end . One thing that disappointed me was the lacklustre ending , after all the build-up I was hoping for something a little more substantial than what was offered , it just ends up being a bit of a let down and rather pedestrian . Robin Groves was good in the leading role , but I thought Micheal David Lally was awful . There's not much gore in it , just a scythe whacked into someones face , someone is impaled and some gunshot wounds at the end . There's a bit of nudity , but not much . The film looks OK and has a decent atmosphere to it , and the octagonal house is both unusual and cool , I don't think I've ever seen another house like it . If you don't mind a horror film with a slightly slow pace then you could do a lot worse than this , but then I suppose you could probably do a lot better as well . Worth watching , if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on T . V . for free .
499498	1355507	239641	5.0	Average straight-to-video sequel .	Mimic 2 starts late one night in the New York City subway , Lincoln Trahm ( Bill Cho Lee ) is walking along when he realise something is after him , some shadowy dark figure that wants to harm him but in his haste to escape Lincoln is run over by a taxi before it can . . . Detective Klaski ( Bruno Campos ) is on the case & his investigations leads him to school teacher Remi ( Alix Koromzay returning from the original ) who doesn't have much luck with boyfriends & when her current romantic engagement Jason ( Brian Leckner ) is murdered & his mutilated corpse is found all roads lead back to Remi , again . while staying late at school Remi & a kid named Sal ( Gaven E . Lucas ) discover that it has become a nest for genetically altered insects from the original Mimic ( 1997 ) whose remaining number have mutated into yet an even more deadly & advanced species that have developed a thing for Remi herself & don't like competition . . . Directed by Jean de Segonzac this was the second film in the Mimic trilogy which started with Mimic , then came this & Mimic : Sentinel ( 2003 ) has been the last entry in the series to date . The script by Joel Soisson is based on the short story by Donald A . Wollheim & is OK but it all feels very average , nothing stands out as being overly enthralling or brilliant . Basically Mimic 2 is a giant monster on the loose attacking humans in an isolated location who have to fight for their lives type film , there are loads of them out there & Mimic 2 isn't exactly the best one . There's the mutated monster plot coupled with a standard stalk'n'slash horror like Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) as they hunt their human victims , usually in very dark corridors . It's clichéd as well , the scientist , the tough cop , the shadowy government officials that could have come straight from The X-Files ( 1993 - 2002 ) & the way the mutant bugs intelligence varies during the film depending on what the script calls for . Mimic 2 is one of those films that is OK for what it is but nothing more , it's not particularly brilliant but at the same time it's not particularly bad just all rather average ' seen-it-all-before ' sci-fi / horror stuff . At only just over 80 minutes long at least it's short . Director Segonzac does an OK as the entire film seems to be lit with bright neon lights which creates some nice scene while at other times it looks very overused & just too staged . It's not that exciting or scary & I thought it was too predictable as well , from who will live right down to the ' twist ' sequel driven ending . There isn't much blood or gore , unfortunately . A mutilated face & some splashes of blood . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 I simply can't see where all that money went , apart from some CGI bug effects there isn't much to it . The special effects are good although it's very obvious that it wasn't shot in New York even though it's supposed to be set there . The acting is OK but nothing special . Mimic 2 is an OK way to pass 80 odd minutes but won't leave a long lasting impression on you . Worth a watch but don't expect a masterpiece .
499086	1355507	117011	5.0	Strictly average JCVD action thriller .	Maximum Risk starts in the South of France where ex-Russian mobster Mikhail Suverov ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) is killed in an accident while trying to escape from two FBI agents chasing him . The police become involved & detective Sebastien ( Jean-Hugues Anglade ) recognises Mikhail as his close friend & fellow cop Alain Moreau ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) , it quickly turns out that Mikhail & Alain were identical twins separated at birth . Wanting to know about his brother & why he was killed Alain follows a trail back to New York where he discovers his brother Mikhail was involved with Russian mobsters & a beautiful waitress named Alex Minetti ( Natasha Henstridge ) , Alain also discovers the Russian mobsters want him dead not to mention the FBI who also want a piece of him . . . Making his American action film debut this run of the mill JCVD action film was directed by Ringo Lam & was the second time a famed Asian action film director made his American feature film debut with JCVD after John Woo made probably JCVD's best film Hard Target ( 1993 ) & JCVD would also star in Hark Tsui's first American film as well with the terrible Double Team ( 1997 ) . Anyway , here the almost humourless script by Larry Ferguson feels like a collection of action film clichés loosely strung together with little regard for a plot , the narrative or the audience . There's the JCVD character who is not only a cop but also an ex-soldier just so he can really handle himself , there's evil mobsters who can't shoot straight , there's a pretty blonde woman who is entirely surplus to the plot & is included solely for her looks , there's various fights & chases , there's a ' big ' tough bad guy who JCVD has to have a climatic showdown with towards the end , there's crooked FBI agents & not much of a plot to speak of . Most of Maximum Risk just feels like JCVD going from one fight to another on the basic pretence that they are after his twin brother & it just gets old very quickly & the whole plot is uninspiring , it's predictable , it's silly & it's throughly routine . I suppose it's watchable , there's nothing spectacularly wrong with it & it moves along at a decent pace but I just can't muster up much enthusiasm for it at all & I consider myself a JCVD fan . Maximum Risk was the second time JCVD played dual roles in a film the first being Double Impact ( 1991 ) where , like in Maximum Risk , he played identical twins & then he went on to play two roles in both Replicant ( 2001 ) & The Order ( 2001 ) . Having said that his twin dies in the opening sequence so there are never two JCVD's on screen at once in Maximum Risk . I have to say that I didn't like the way Maximum Risk was shot at all , the fact I saw a pan and scan version rather than a full 2 : 35 : 1 widescreen edition didn't help but the camera angles are weird & they just don't capture the action that well , the length of shot is very short & the editing is just very bad & annoying as it makes it difficult so get a grip of what is going on & finally there's that horrible shaky camera syndrome which just adds to the general irritation . The action feels routine , the fights are alright but nothing special while the chases are ruined by being poorly shot & aren't much to begin with anyway . Also what does Lam have against plastic garden furniture ? The amount of scenes in which he crashes cars into plastic chairs & tables outside cafés seems to be too numerous to be a coincidence . With a supposed budget of about $25 , 000 , 000 Maximum Risk really should have been better than this , I think it's a throughly routine & badly shot action flick that apart from one or two car chases & some expensive location work looks like it was a made-for-telly effort . The locations sound impressive having been shot in Paris , Canada & New York . The acting is poor , I think JCVD is terrible in this while all the Russian accents are unconvincing although at least Hanstridge is easy on the eyes & she goes topless briefly in one scene . Maximum Risk is one of JCVD's more routine efforts , I found it a really disappointing film that was badly shot & written . Having said that it passes the time & is nowhere near his worst although at the same time it's nowhere near his best . After several big hits like Universal Soldier ( 1992 ) , Hard Target , Timecop ( 1994 ) & Sudden Death ( 1995 ) you can trace the demise of JCVD pretty much back to Maximum Risk .
498172	1355507	330793	5.0	Nothing special , I prefer the Lundgren version from the late 80's .	The Punisher starts as an illegal arms deal goes bad & Bobby Saint ( James Carpinello ) is shot dead by Federal Agents , it was all a set-up & poor old Bobby has ended up in a body bag because of it . The operation was set up by FBI agent Frank Castle ( Thomas Jane ) & Bobby happens to the son of a powerful & wealthy underworld banker named Howard Saint ( John Travolta ) & when Howard learns of Castle he orders his men to kill Castle & his entire family . Howard's men manage to kill Castle's family but not Frank himself who decides to become a vigilante & go it alone in order to punish those responsible for the brutal slaying of his entire family , it's a long dark , bloody & death filled road but it's one Frank is determined to walk down in pursuit of justice . . . This American German co-production was co-written & directed by Jonathan Hensleigh who manages to turn in a film that is strictly average , it should be noted that since the theatrical version was released an extended by 20 odd minutes cut has been released on DVD & I will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical cut as I haven't seen the extended one . The script by Hensleigh & Michael France is based on the Marvel comic book character & strangely doesn't feel like a comic book film at all , the Punisher as a character has no superpowers like say Spider-Man or Superman & even the action scenes are relatively low & disappointingly un-comic book like . I was hoping for huge over-the-top set-pieces & action scenes which never came , as a whole The Punisher feels very much like a routine ' one man army on a revenge mission ' action thriller of which there are countless examples out there . The only distinguishing feature of the Punisher himself is his skull motif on his shirt & that's it . The film is utterly predictable as well with the viewer knowing from the first frame that Castle will kill all the bad guy's & avenge his dead family . The character's aren't great , the three comedy relief teenagers who live near Castle feel out of place , Howard Saint is given no background & Castle himself just doesn't seem that cut up about his family . Director Hensleigh does alright but there's nothing particularly special in The Punisher , the action scenes are well choreographed & there's plenty of blood & dead bodies flying around but there's no ' big ' comic book action scenes here & apart from one or two cool looking guns , a bow & arrow & a butterfly knife the weaponry is also rather dull & routine looking . I personally think The Punisher ( 1988 ) staring Dolph Lundgren is far superior to this , despite the lower budget the action scenes are better , it's better paced & less boring , the villains are better , the weaponry from ninja throwing stars to samurai swords to sawn off shotguns to deadly razor sharp earrings are much more fun & feels much more like a comic book as is the film as a whole . In fact I can't think of one aspect of the new Punisher that I liked more than the Lundgren one , I even preferred his beat up old motorbike he drives around on rather than the car he has in this . The violence isn't that excessive , there's plenty of dead bodies , someone gets a knife stuck under their chin & someone gets an arrow through their neck . I was a bit surprised to learn that The Punisher only had a budget of about $15 , 500 , 000 which isn't a lot of money , in fact until recently Steven Seagal's straight-to-video efforts have had higher budgets . Shot in Florida this is well made but not particularly stylish & the only time it tries to be when an explosion caused by the Punisher causes flames in the shape of his skull motif just look silly . The acting is OK , I'm not sure what Travolta is doing in this & I'm not sure how much he was paid as for his previous film Basic ( 2003 ) & one of his next Ladder 49 ( 2004 ) he was paid $20 , 000 , 000 each which is more than the entire budget for The Punisher ! The Punisher is a bit of a disappointment , this could have been a entertaining & ultra violent action flick with a cool comic book feel but instead it feels like a standard average budget revenge flick . Watch the ' 88 Punisher instead as it's a better film in every respect in my opinion . The sequel The Punisher : Welcome Back , Frank ( 2008 ) has been made & will be out soon , probably straight-to-video .
499404	1355507	91344	6.0	" Well , we should have no problem identifying the enemy , their approximately 50 feet tall & wearing their birthday suit's . " So bad it's good .	King Kong Lives starts off with the final few minutes from the original King Kong ( 1976 ) as the giant Gorilla seemingly falls to his death from the World Trade Center in New York . Jump to ' Atlanta Institute , Georgia Ten Years Later ' where they have Kong ( Peter Elliott ) on a life support system waiting to undergo a heart transplant ( ! ) . Dr . Amy Franklin ( Linda Hamilton ) is ready to perform the operation but Kong needs a steady supply of blood to survive the procedure , as luck would have it diamond mercenary Hank Mitchell ( Brian Kerwin ) has found a lady Kong ( George Yiasoumi ) while trekking through the Borneo jungle . In no time whatsoever the institute has brought the female & the operation has taken place with the artificial heart going in nicely . The operation is a success & Kong lives , the institute decides to keep both Gorillas but when Kong hears the female call out he uses all his strength to break free from his chains & go in search of a mate , obviously the United States Army can't have giant apes running around can they so it's up to Colonel Nevitt ( John Ashton ) to capture them by whatever means necessary . . . Directed by John Guillermin & , according to the IMDb an uncredited Charles McCracken , this is the sequel to the ' 76 remake of King Kong which Guillermin also directed . In my humble opinion I think King Kong Lives is one of those so-bad-it's-good abominations that I simply can't believe someone green lighted & trust me King Kong Lives is a bad film through & through . The script by Roland Shusett & Steven Pressfield is absolutely hilarious at times , you won't know weather to laugh or cry at some of the stuff that makes it's way into this film . I think King Kong Lives is meant to be a serious film but scenes such as the heart transplant complete with massive over-sized medical instruments , the giant artificial heart that needs to be lowered into Kong's chest using a crane ( ! ) & all filmed in complete seriousness , there's a bit when Kong manages to ' sneak ' up behind an entire platoon of soldiers , for Christs sake Kong is a 50 foot Gorilla couldn't any of these dumb soldiers see him ? The scenes in which Kong & Lady Kong romanticise with hugs , ' I love you ' type looks & Kong wanting to give her something so he uproots a bunch of trees & tries to give her those ! The entire concept is bizarre , daft & just complete total & utter nonsense while at times it becomes embarrassing to watch . But having said that it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring , when all said & done I found King Kong Lives to be a throughly entertaining film for all the wrong reasons . Director Guillermin messes everything up , there is no excitement , scares , tension or any action although it is quite funny on numerous occasions . The whole mood of the film is wrong considering just how stupid it is . There are a few snippets of violence & gore , Kong's removed heart , someone is snapped in two , Kong eats someone as well as a load of crocodiles & he gets shot at the end . With a supposed budget of over $30 , 000 , 000 King Kong Lives is a travesty , where did all the money go ? The special effects are worse than the ' 76 version in my opinion because of the 10 year gap , didn't special effects move on at all during that period ? If you put King Kong ' 76 & King Kong Lives side-by-side you would think not . It really is just a man in a rubber monkey suit from beginning to end , the full size hand & arm shots are awful as they just look so stiff & unnatural . For 30 big ones King Kong Lives is a shoddily produced film & doesn't look the part at all . The acting is about as good as you would expect from such a silly film , I wonder if the cast knew how bad this was going to turn out to be ? King Kong Lives provides 100 odd minutes of pure entertainment for me , it's a crap film but it's just so bad it's good . It's a bit like a train wreck , you know you shouldn't look but you can't take your eyes off it . An absolute treat for bad film fans !
498672	1355507	191235	6.0	" You should have learned by now not to ask questions you don't want the answers to . " I quite liked it .	Knocking on Death's Door starts on a dark & stormy night as a policeman ( Philip Sweeney ) & Dr . Hadley ( Colm O'Maonlai ) break into the large isolated house belonging to Elizabeth Cartwright ( Stella Feehilly ) only to discover her dead body , her having apparently committed suicide with an OD . A violent force sweeps through the house & the cop has an axe embedded in his chest , Hadley manages to escape . . . Jump ' Twenty Years Later ' & newly married parapsychologists Brad ( Brian Bloom ) & Danielle Gallagher ( Kimberly Rowe ) are told by their boss professor Paul Ballard ( John Doe ) that he wants them to investigate the ghostly goings on in the notorious Sunset House . They head straight there & set all their scientific equipment up in preparation , Brad is the brains & Danielle is the psychic one who can contact the ' other side ' . It quickly turns out that the house is indeed haunted , from flying red hot pokers to killer Grandfather clocks & ghostly reflections in mirrors . Brad & Danielle feel there is more here than a simple haunting , the name Samuel is written in chalk on the basement floor & as they research Sunset House's history they find a dark & sinister past that still remains unresolved to this day . . . Directed by Mitch Marcus I actually thought Knocking on Death's Door was a decent film , surprisingly enough since it comes from king of the low-budget cheapies Roger Corman & his New Concorde production company . The script by Craig J . Nevius takes itself extremely seriously , it moves along at a fair pace & has most of the traditional haunted house clichés . Knocking on Death's Door concentrates on character's , story & atmosphere rather than cheap scares or gore . The ghost isn't overly hostile & certainly isn't scary as it tries to relay a message & settle old scores using Brad & Danielle . There is a fair amount of soap opera type drama but it sits quite well along side the supernatural happenings . One unusual aspect is that this ghost doesn't like anyone having sex & that's when it attacks people , in my opinion all this plot thread facilitates is to have brad & Danielle have sex & there's one bit when Danielle slips her hand down the front of her jeans & starts to masturbate at which our ghost is not best pleased . . . As one would expect it all rounds off with a twist climax & final revelation that to be honest is a little bit too obvious although is more than passable . Director Marcus manages to create a nice atmosphere overall although there's a lack of decent scares or jump out of your seat type moments . While Knocking on Death's Door doesn't have much in the way of visual style or flair it's well made & isn't as cheap looking as a lot of Corman productions . Apart from a gory axe killing at the start , a cut & some skeletal remains there is no blood or gore whatsoever although there is a fair amount of mild sex . Technically the film is fine & generally well made , it was shot in Ireland & for some reason takes no advantage of the location at all . The acting was decent enough & it's always nice to see David Carradine although bear in mind that even though he gets top billing in the opening credits he gets about 5 minutes of screen time , maybe he took the role because he wanted a free holiday in Ireland ? Knocking on Death's Door is an alright little haunted house horror , I sub-genre that I don't usually like that much . I mean it's not brilliant or anything but you could do a lot worse . Worth a watch .
498147	1355507	840802	6.0	" Remember that living forever thing ? It's just not you . " OK episode .	Blade : The Series : Hunters starts at a metal club called Brash where a young attractive girl named Jennifer ( Melanie Papalia ) is kidnapped along with Nikki ( Katharine Horsman ) one of the waitresses by Kurt ( Dominic Zamprogna ) the human familiar of a sadistic disfigured Vampire known as the White Prince ( Scott Heindl ) who has a liking for torturing young girls . Meanwhile Blade ( Sticky Fingaz ) is having some trouble with his Vampire informant Krista ( Jill Wagner ) but decides to look into the disappearance of Nikki after her sister Bethany ( Lauren Lee Smith ) contacts Blade's sidekick Shen ( Nelson lee ) for help , Blade goes about his work in his usual style which means if he doesn't get what he wants people get hurt . . . This was episode 10 from season 1 of the made-for-TV Blade : The Series , directed by Brad Turner I thought Hunters was OK but nothing special . The script by Geoff Johns isn't anything inspirational & feels too routine & uninspired for my liking with Blade chasing yet another Vampire which ends up in a climatic fight where Blade triumphs so in that respect you could say it's a touch predictable . Then there's the fact since these are 45 minute bite sized chunks it's difficult to build much momentum up although there are a couple of other plot threads which clearly run throughout the series so if you watch Hunters in isolation there may be the odd part here & there which doesn't seem to make much sense . Worth a watch but it won't change your life . There are a few decent scenes here , the parts where the White prince has Nikki tided up & then makes her watch videos of him torturing Jennifer are quite sleazy & his mask of human skin complete with human teeth still attached around the mouth reminds me of Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films & is quite gross . Unfortunately this is pretty tame , just when you think something nasty might happen it chickens out , the fights are OK but not particularly exciting or extravagant . The only real gore is when someone slices their own hand with a cutthroat razor & when someone has their jaw ripped off . It's generally well made for what it is but it's obvious things had to be scaled down from the films . Hunters is an OK way to pass 45 minutes , it's slick enough , it has some fights , a bit of gore & a good looking cast but I'd still rather watch one of the films again .
496935	1355507	338145	6.0	" Put out their eyes & never let them work again in the movie industry . " Reasonable ' Making-of ' .	It's Only a Movie : The Making of ' Last House on the Left ' runs just under 30 minutes & is a reasonable if slight collection of short interview clips with some of the cast & crew , in fact it sometimes feels more like a reunion than a informative documentary . Behind the camera is represented by editor , writer & director Wes Craven , producer Sean S . Cunningham & gopher Steve Miner . In front of the camera participant's are Lucy Grantham , David Hess , Fred Lincoln , Martin Kove & Marc Sheffler . The documentary is presented in a linear way starting with The Last House on the Left's origins & how the film was originally funded by a group of Boston drive-in owners who financed their own second features of a double bill & that's how The Last on the Left was financed . Then it goes into the casting like Martin Kove was originally going to be the main villain Krug but Kove wanted to be the comic relief & suggested his friend David Hess . The interviewees then discuss the filming which took 4 weeks & that it was shot in Westport , Connecticut at Cunningham's house & surrounding land . Then the subject of the films marketing arises with the revelation that it was shot under the title ' Night of Vengeance ' which was then dropped & changed to ' Krug & Co . ' & ' Sex Crime of the Century ' both of which did nothing at the box-office until someone suggested the title The Last House on the Left to Cunningham who gave it a try & never looked back I suppose . There are a few decent anecdotes in here but for the most part I found it largely uninformative & lightweight but since it's a free extra on a DVD I can't really complain & it features a few behind the scenes photos & a little bit of footage for the fans . It's the sort of documentary that is a back patting ' didn't he do well ' type appreciation piece . You will watch it once & then completely forget about it within a week or so , It's Only a Move : The Making of ' Last House on the Left ' is an OK time waster & the only real interest was in seeing what everyone looks like now .
497691	1355507	312399	6.0	A complete autopsy on camera , nothing else .	Autopsy : Through the Eyes of Death's Detectives , the version I saw also had the on screen subtitle ' Voices of Death ' , sees pathologist Dr . Thomas T . Noguchi M . D . who was apparently responsible for autopsy's on Marilyn Monroe & Robert F . Kennedy according to the DVD box I have & two assistant's or two students or one assistant & one students conduct an autopsy in unflinching detail . First the body of a woman is placed on a metal table & a basic examination of the body takes place , the corpses face & genital area are both blurred throughout . Noguchi takes a scalpel & cuts the corpses chest & stomach & peels the skin back , he then uses what looks like a pair of garden clippers to cut through the ribs after which he removes the sternum which exposes the main organs . Noguchi then proceeds to cut out & examine in closer detail the heart , lungs , liver , intestines , brain & finally the spine & spinal cord . One of the assistant's / students then sews her back together again & pops her back in the freezer . This made-for-video documentary was co-produced & directed by Michael Kriegsman & according to the IMDb has the tag-line ' The Dark Side of Medicine ' & the DVD I own features artwork that depicts two surgical saws set against a blood soaked background which leads me to think that it is being advertised as a Faces of Death ( 1979 ) style exploitation shockumentary . Well , I can tell you now that this was intended as a serious documentary as it's full of dry medical terminology & facts . There is no narration , no music , neither Noguchi or his students / assistants are introduced & feels more like a medical training video . No explanation is given for any of the medical jargon or what's happening on screen & as I'm not involved with the medical profession at all I found myself becoming lost & losing interest . One other thing I really need to say in this regard is that Noguchi obviously isn't American or a native English speaker , he mumbles often in broken English in his accent behind a surgical mask which makes the problem even worse ! I could barely understand a word he was saying & couple this with the constant bewildering medical phrases I found it incredibly frustrating to listen to & try to understand . The autopsy itself is presented with graphic detail & only those with strong stomachs need apply , the scene where he slices her scalp & saws her cranium to expose her brain is pretty hard to watch . That's about it really , you get an autopsy complete with live sound as it happens until it's over & then the credits run . There is no context given to anything , it's what you see is what you get . I can't say I particularly enjoyed it but at the same time there is a certain morbid fascination & I definitely have the stomach for this sort of thing which helps . It's fine at what it does but the lack of any explanation , questions , narration or reasoning leaves a very empty somewhat pointless feeling to the whole thing . Could have been better but does what it promises I suppose , worth a watch for those with the stomach .
498903	1355507	74157	6.0	" We've been on top of the Earth long enough , it's about time we found out what's underneath " Entertaining fantasy adventure .	At the Earth's Core begins in a Victorian factory . It moulds special steel parts as workers assemble a strange machine to Dr . Abner Perry's ( Peter Cushing ) specific blueprints . Dr Perry has designed & created what he describes as a ' high calibration drilling machine ' , a machine that he hopes will bore it's way to the centre of the Earth . The day of it's maiden voyage has arrived , the machine nicknamed ' the iron mole ' by it's pilot David Innes ( Doug McClure ) , is taken to a hill somewhere in Wales & Dr . Perry plans to burrow through it to the other side . At first things go well but the machine becomes uncontrollable & both David & Abner lose consciousness . Eventually they come round & discover that they have burrowed to the very core of the Earth where they are shocked to find a whole new world named Pellucidar . It's a prehistoric world full of tribes & monsters , a world where the darkness of night never falls . After an encounter with a large monster that has a parrot's head but the body of a reptile Abner & David are captured by a race known as the Sagoth , humanoid type creatures with pig like facial features . The Sagoth are controlled by the Mahar , a race of intelligent , telepathic flying reptile things that rule Pellucidar with the help of the Sagoth . They capture humans & enslave them making them work , the Mahar's also like to eat pretty young girls which doesn't go down that well . When David & Abner discover what the Mahar's are up to they decide to help out the people of Pellucidar by leading a rebellion & hopefully freeing them from their evil forever . To complicate things even more David falls for a Princess named Dia ( Caroline Munro ) but others want her as well including a dodgy guy named Hoojah the Sly One ( Sean Lynch ) & a fat bloke named Jubal the Ugly One ( Micheal Crane ) , David has to watch his back as if it's not flying telepathic birds & prehistoric monsters trying to eat him he's getting agro from jealous cavemen . . . Directed by Kevin Connor At the Earth's Core was the second in a quartet of similar themed films from the British production company Amicus , the first was The Land that Time Forgot ( 1974 ) , then came this , the third was The People that Time Forgot ( 1977 ) & finally concluded with Warlords of Atlantis ( 1978 ) all starred Doug McClure & were directed by Connor . The script for At the Earth's Core by Milton Subotsky , based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs of the same name , was very entertaining . It moves along like a rocket , we're at the Earth's core & seeing monsters within the first fifteen minutes & generally speaking the film carries on at a great pace . Luckily it never seems to take itself too seriously . It contains likable characters , good action adventure elements , the obligatory monsters & even has time to chuck in a bit of romance . However , I could have done without the mushy sentimentality at the end . A lot of people seem to criticise the special effects in At the Earth's Core & to be fair they ain't all that hot but they add a certain charm & personality to the film overall . I quite liked the monsters in this actually , from the Mahar's to the giant fire breathing frog creature . Just forget about the obvious wire work or the silly man in a rubber monster suit trying to walk menacingly , sit back & enjoy , you never know you might have some fun as I did . The production design was impressive , Pellucidar looks quite good with it's purple sky & jungle landscapes with it's bizarre plants , giant mushroom's & the City of the Mahar's with it's underground caverns & flowing lava . I also really liked the look of the drilling machine , both inside & out . The acting is OK , I'm a huge Cushing fan & think he's a great actor & I really liked him in this . Cushing plays Abner with a goofy charm , referring to the Sagoth as ' unpleasent characters ' or when faced with a rampaging monster he says ' yes , it does seem a somewhat aggressive looking creature ' or when the Mahar's try to control him he comments ' you can't mesmerise me , I'm British ! ' . McClure makes for a decent hero & Munro is fine , if a little underused , as the love interest & again there's a great bit when Dia says ' it's Jubal the Ugly One ' to which McClure replies after seeing him ' you can say that again ' . Personally I like this type of ' lost world ' film & At the Earth's Core is a good example of the genre . On the down side the special effects do hurt it at the end of the day as it's sometimes a little hard to keep a straight face & the film definitely loses some credibility because of it . I also thought that there was a little too much walking around in caves which did start to become annoying , the fact that except for McClure nobody else has that much screen time & I didn't understand the explanation given for the Mahar's power . Overall I think At the Earth's Core is a good Saturday morning fantasy adventure film with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure that's suitable for all ages , all that's left to say is that bad special effects don't automatically make for a bad film just as the opposite is true .
497751	1355507	113636	6.0	" If you want magic bend over & I'll pull a rabbit out of your are . " Entertaining third instalment of the Leprechaun series	Leprechaun 3 is set entirely in Las Vegas where Gupta ( Marcelo Tubert ) runs a shop called ' The Pawn Place ' . One night a man named Lucky ( Richard Reicheg ) walks in & wants to sell a stone statue of an ugly Leprechaun ( Warwick Davis ) , Gupta gives the guy $20 for it but before Lucky leaves he warns Gupta not to remove the medallion from around it's neck . As one would expect Gupta takes the medallion straight away to see how much it's worth & the Leprechaun comes to life & leaves his pot of gold exposed . Gupta decides to take the gold for himself but the Leprechaun kills him to get it back . Meanwhile outside a woman named Tammy Larsen ( Lee Armstrong ) has broken down & good natured teenager Scott McCoy ( John Gatins ) decides to give her a lift to work , the ' Lucky Shamrock Casino ' . Scott is on his way to Los Angeles to go to college but can't resist the temptation to gamble his $23 , 000 college fund , he loses the lot . To try & win some of it back he sets out to pawn his gold watch & discovers one of the Leprechaun's gold pieces which he accidentally finds out can grant the owner a wish , soon other people discover the secret too as the gold passes from person to person who all get a visit from the evil Leprechaun in a search for his gold piece . . . Directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith I thought Leprechaun 3 was OK . The script by David DuBos never takes itself seriously & there are a few amusing moments dotted throughout the film like the bit where the Leprechaun meets an Elvis impersonator . Obviously part of a franchise the Leprechaun character swears & rhymes his way through various one-liners , I have to admit I quite like the little fellow . The film moves along at a nice enough pace & is never boring or dull . The horror is somewhat diluted & the way the Leprechaun dispatches his victims all comes across as very silly so if you want something deep & meaningful then Leprechaun 3 is most definitely not the film for you . I thought the character's were actually quite likable from the talentless magician Fazio ( John DeMita ) to the vain Loretta ( Caroline Williams ) . For whatever reason I found Leprechaun 3 entertaining & at the end of the day that's all I really want from a film . Director Smith gives a nod to one of his previous film Turkey Shoot ( 1982 ) with a bit when the Leprechaun bites someone's toe off . He directs with competence & the Las Vegas setting is cool but nothing really stands out . There's not much gore , a toe & ear biting scene , someone explodes ( but strangely there's no blood ) , someone is bitten & the films best moment when Fazio the magician is cut in half on stage by the Leprechaun , with a chainsaw . Technically the film is fine with good production values & it's generally well made considering the budget must have been pretty small & went straight to video . The acting is alright & Davis seems to enjoy his role as the evil Leprechaun , a special word for Armstrong as Tammy who is one fine looking lady & gets to wear a great outfit for the majority of the films duration which is fine with me . I liked Leprechaun 3 overall & it's far better than than the crap second film Leprechaun 2 ( 1994 ) . Three more straight to video Leprechaun films followed this , Leprechaun 4 : In Space ( 1997 ) , Leprechaun in the Hood ( 2000 ) , Leprechaun : Back 2 tha Hood ( 2003 ) . Definitely worth a watch .
498015	1355507	430334	6.0	Not too bad , at least it was gory .	Mansquito starts as we learn that a deadly virus spread by mosquito's is claiming 1000's of victims across America , scientist's Dr . Aaron Michaels ( Jay Benedict ) & Dr . Jennifer Allen ( Musetta Vander ) are trying to create a mosquito which will mate with normal mosquito's & eradicate the virus or something like that . Convicted mass murderer Ray Erikson ( Austin Jordan ) has enrolled in a medical research program where he lets people like Michaels do stuff to him for a lighter sentence , however en-route to Michaels lab Ray manages to steal a cops gun & in the following gunfight a special reactor in the lab blows up & covers Ray in some slimy blue DNA altered gunk which has the unwanted side effect of turning him into a grotesque 7 foot tall half man / half mosquito creature who needs to drink a lot of blood to survive . Lieutenant Tom Randall ( Corin Nemec ) is on the case as the Mansquito drinks dry everyone it meets . . . Also known as MosquitoMan yes folks here we have yet another Nu Image creature feature that they seem to have an endless conveyor belt of , the one surprising thing about Mansquito is that I didn't think it was half bad & a lot better than just about any other Nu Image creature feature I can think of right now . Directed by Tibor Takacs Mansquito is a throwback to the giant bug flicks from the 50's & 60's with added gore & CGI , the script by Michael Hurst & it's title character also bear more than a passing resemblance to The Fly ( 1986 ) . The usual Nu Image creature feature plot points & clichés are here , genetic scientists experiments create mutant creature , cop tries to track creature down , creature kills lots of unimportant character's & causes general mayhem . However Mansquito manages to stand out as a fairly fun monster on the loose type flick & it also has the added bonus of lots of gore along with a very high body count which Nu Image films usually lack . The makers obviously didn't do much research as male Mosquito's can't suck blood & I don't understand what Ray was going to used for or what the scientists were trying to achieve in their experiments but did you expect common sense & realism from a horror flick called Mansquito ? No , neither did I so just sit back & enjoy it for what it is , a simple by-the-numbers yet effective & fun creature feature with some neat gore . Director Takacs does OK , the film looks nice enough & he keeps things moving along at a reasonable pace . While most Nu Image films use awful CGI computer effects Mansquito pleasingly uses traditional prosthetic & animatronic make-up effects for it's title character & the many gory killings which I'll give the film an extra star for regardless . Actual on set physical effects look so much better than cheap CGI , sure the effects here aren't brilliant but the man in a rubber monster suit still looks better & it's as simple & straight forward as that . When the time comes for the makers to use CGI when Mansquito decides to fly it looks OK . As you would expect there are lots of running around in the dark while Mansquito stalks it's prey & there's a cool hospital massacre sequence at the end . Ther are numerous attack scenes all of which contain fair amounts of blood , there's the usual assortment of dead bodies in various states of mutilation , there's severed limbs , there are shoot outs , someones head is stamped on by Mansquito & splits open & a great scene when someone has half their head diagonally sliced off by Mansquito's razor arm . Luckily the makers weren't afraid to use the fake blood blood either , during the hospital massacre is looks like someone spray painted the walls with the stuff ! With a supposed budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 the reason why Mansquito is better looking , gorier & more impressive than most Nu Image creature features is because it had a bigger budget then most Nu Image creature features & to be fair to it it shows . It's quite well made with decent production values . The acting isn't great from a cast virtual unknowns , unknown to me anyway . Mansquito isn't the best film in the world , it isn't even the best creature feature in the world by I thought it was entertaining enough in it's own right & passed 90 odd minutes harmlessly enough . Nu Image isn't known for the quality of their films so the fact Mansquito is actually quiet good is an achievement in itself , fans should definitely check this one out as it's one of their best in my opinion .
498642	1355507	681756	6.0	" I'm not making any promises . . . but I'll see what I can do . " Decent murder mystery .	Quincy M . E . : Ashes to Ashes starts as Marie Yagher ( Judith Baldwin ) suddenly drops down dead in a bar , she ends up on Los Angeles coroner Quincy's ( Jack Klugman ) autopsy table & he quickly discovers she died from cardiac arrest or to put it more simply a heart attack . Quincy is unsure why she died form a heart attack though , she was seemingly young , healthy & had no heart problems to that point . Then a woman named Tracy Boulder ( Janice Lynde ) confesses to Quincy her suspicions of Marie's husband Richard ( John Fink ) who was married to her sister Donna who also mysterious died from a sudden unexplained heart attack three years ago leaving him free to marry the rich Marie , Tracy is sure it was murder & as the evidence stacks up Quincy becomes convinced of it as well but can he prove it ? Episode 17 from season 3 this Quincy murder mystery was directed by Herb Wallerstein & is an enjoyable enough entry into the series . Once again Quincy has go out on a limb as he puts his reputation on the line to catch a murderer & prove that there was even a murder in the first place , that brief outline sounds familiar because it is familiar as it's been used many time in the series but I must admit I never tire of it . The makers usually throw something different into the mix & try to vary the story lines , in this case Quincy manages to autopsy a pile of ashes to get to the truth ! At the standard 50 minutes ( without commercials ) in length it moves along at a brisk pace & certainly entertained me but then I'm a fan of the show in general so maybe I'm biased . As usual there are one or two things which don't quite add up , for a start that dodgy Doctor Jones who lives in Mexico sure tells Quincy what he wants to know without much resistance doesn't he ? You would have thought spilling the guts & dishing the dirt on your customers wouldn't be particularly good for business but this guy doesn't seem to care , what makes it worse as soon as Quincy leaves he phones Richard to tell him ! Talk about a good way to lose customers , just grass them up to the authorities & implicate them in a murder ! Does Doctor Jones actually want to go out of business ? Then there's the scene when Lt . Monahan is waiting in Asten's office to tell Quincy just by chance that Richard is about to fly to Brazil , why would Monahan be monitoring Richard when he didn't even believe Quincy's story ? Why waste valuable police time waiting for Quincy to come back to the lab to tell him information which might not mean anything ? Competently made but unremarkable to look at this is standard Quincy stuff , there's a very racist & stereotypical studio bound set of a bar that is meant to be in Mexico . The acting is alright , as usual it's the regulars which carry it & as usual the guest cast aren't so hot with John Fink as Richard turning in a poor performance . Ashes to Ashes is a good solid Quincy murder mystery , sure there are a few silly moments in it but most of what makes the series so likable is here .
498797	1355507	209095	6.0	" The only record deal you getting ' is with the L . A . P . D . " I actually quite liked it .	Leprechaun in the Hood starts some years ago as two gold hunters Mack Daddy ( Ice-T ) & Slug following a map to a sealed room containing a statue of a Leprechaun & lots of gold . Slug removes a gold medallion from around the Leprechaun's neck after which the Leprechaun ( Warwick Davis ) comes to life & kills Slug with his comb . Mack Daddy discovers that by putting the medallion back the evil Irish Leprechaun is turned back into a statue , Mack Daddy also steal the Leprechaun's magic flute . Jump forward to present day Los Angeles where three young rappers Postmaster P . ( Anthony Montgomery ) , Stray Bulllet ( Rashaan Nall ) & Butch ( Red Grant ) are trying to make it ' large ' in the world of rap music & want to enter a competition but need money & equipment . Which is where the now successful gangster Mack Daddy comes in , he has the money & connections to help them make it big but tells them to get lost . In revenge Postmaster , Stray & Butch decide to rob Mack's place but end up stealing the magic flute , the gold & in an ensuing struggle accidentally sets the Leprechaun free again . However Mack sees them & goes after them with the intent of regaining his magic flute , the Leprechaun also is on their trail as he also wants his gold & flute back & both will kill to get them . . . Directed by Rob Spera Leprechaun in the Hood was the fifth film in the Leprechaun series ( & the only one I've seen thus far ) following Leprechaun 4 : In Space ( 1997 ) & preceding Leprechaun : Back 2 Tha Hood ( 2003 ) . I have to admit that I actually rather liked it for what it was , it ain't brilliant but I found myself having fun with it . The script by Doug Hall & John Huffman moves along at a nice pace , thankfully never takes itself too seriously & mixes horror & comedy to good effect in my humble opinion . The three central character's were surprisingly likable , there are lots of quite amusing dialogue although the film features non stop swearing with the term Mother Fcker constantly being used throughout . In fact at times it almost seems like a competition to see how many swear words can be inserted into a single sentence . The leprechaun himself gets plenty of one-liners & wise cracks while constantly talking in rhyme , he makes for a decent villain . I particularly liked a scene in a Church when the rappers were singing & swearing all over the place in front of the congregation ! The story was OK & it mixed rap & horror to a reasonable extent which I wouldn't have necessarily expected . There isn't much in the way of blood or gore , some severed body parts in jars , the Leprechaun puts his hand through someones chest & makes a couple of people's stomachs explode & Leprechaun in the Hood is maybe the only film I've seen which features a blood spurting death by plastic comb , stuck into someones throat no less ! There are some seriously hot looking babes in this as well , it's just a shame about those awful green computer generated eyes . Technically Leprechaun in the Hood has the look of a made for TV film , the special effects are OK at best , the film's soundtrack is populated by foul mouthed rap music which I didn't like too much & as a whole it's generally quite well made in a low budget horror sort of way . The acting is alright as long as no one tries to do anything serious which luckily isn't very often , Ice-T is alright but despite his top-billing in the credits has doesn't feature too much , apparently Coolio is in here somewhere but if you blink you'll miss him . For what it was I liked Leprechaun in the Hood , I thought it was quite often funny , had a certain charm & personality & has decent character's . It ain't no masterpiece but then I never expected it to be , hard to recommend but you could do a lot worse that's for sure .
498710	1355507	95063	6.0	" He doesn't need a wife , he needs a bank he can bonk . " Dream Demon had potential but ultimately disappoints .	Dream Demon starts at a wedding as the Minister ( Richard Warner ) ask's the bride Diana Markham ( Jemma Redgrave ) to take her vows but she hesitates & declines so the groom Oliver Hall ( Mark Greenstreet ) slaps her across the face , Diana ain't going to take that sort of thing so slaps him back which makes his head fly off his body & fountains of blood spurt everywhere . Diana suddenly wakes up , it was just a horrible nightmare . Diana is in reality engaged to Falklands War hero Oliver & their wedding becomes a big story with two local scumbag reporters Paul Lawrence ( Jimmy Nail ) & Russell Peck ( Timothy Spall ) who constantly hassle her for a story & try to dig a bit of dirt up if you know what I mean . One day Diana befriends an American teenager named Jenny Hoffman ( Kathleen Wilhoite ) who claims she can't remember anything about her childhood but then confusingly says she remembers growing up in the house in which Diana now lives having just moved in a mere 2 weeks ago . Diana continues to have terrifying nightmares , a doll that a large maggot crawls out off , the basement turning into a labyrinth of dark corridors , a split in the wall appearing & starting to pour with blood & both Paul & Russell turn up horribly disfigured taunting her . Jenny also starts to experience Diana's nightmares , but in reality while Diana sleeps . Diana starts to lose her grip on reality as her nightmares take over , is it all in Diana's imagination ? Is the sudden appearance of Jenny a mere coincidence ? Is the house somehow involved ? Is there a purpose to these gruesome nightmares ? You will have to watch it to find out . . . This British produced film was co-written & directed by Harley Cokeliss & while I thought Dream Demon had potential it ultimately disappoints . The script by Cokeliss & Christopher Wicking is at fault here , basically it's one big unexplained mess . Even now I simply don't know what really happened & I finished watching it mere hours ago , where do the two newspaper journalists come into it ? What were their purpose & why do they just walk off at the end discussing fast food ? Why does not one single person die during the entire film ? Where's the horror & threat ? Why does Jenny not remember anything about her childhood but specifically remembers the exact house she grew up in in London ? I mean London is a pretty big place you know & considering she can't remember anything else . . . What were the meaning & purpose of these nightmares ? I know it recounts the house's past but why ? Nothing is put right , nothing is avenged , nothing is resolved & at the end nothing has changed from when Dream Demon started . One final baffling question , does anyone else think Kathleen Wilhoite looks like a man ? That jaw line , that nose & her face in general screams transvestite ! On the positive side director Cokeliss manages to create some terrific sequences , I absolutely love that wedding scene at the beginning ! The scenes that feature the disfigured Paul & Russell are pretty creepy especially a scene in a lift , I don't know what they did to Jimmy Nail to make him look the way he did but he gave me the creeps big time ! It moves along at a nice pace but for the first hour or so it's just Diana having a nightmare , waking up & telling people about it & then having another nightmare , waking up again & telling people that she's had another one , & so this pattern continues for over an hour & I found it started to become dull as I wanted some sort of explanation of what was going on . The slightest hint of a story would have helped , there are also various plot threads that are left unexplored like the possible child abuse suffered by Jenny , the Angel symbolism , the two-timing fiancé & Diana's virginity & marital fears . There are some impressive gore effects too , the aforementioned decapitation at the wedding , a fist punched through someones head & some gory make-up effects plastered on Spall including him having his ear pulled off . It's just a shame there wasn't more of them & that ultimately they were all only dreams & everyone in the film survives . With a modest budget of about £3 , 000 , 000 Dream Demon has nice production design & is well made with a certain class & the late 80's London setting makes it feel a little different . The acting is surprisingly strong throughout except Kathleen Wilhoite , now I have nothing against her but she does look like a bloke & she is both terrible & annoying in her role , urgh . Well what can I say to sum up ? There is no dream demon that the title refers to , it has a very loose poorly thought out story which is confusing & when all said & done Dream Demon disappointed & in no way could be described as the British A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) . It's unusual & has some great ideas & individual scenes but isn't something that I could recommend to the casual film-goer , however die-hard horror fans would probably get something out of it but just don't expect too much .
498646	1355507	114196	6.0	Passable enough rip-off of John Carpenter's ' The Thing ' , not too bad at all .	Six people board a yacht presumably somewhere in Thailand , it's never revealed exactly where we are at this point . The group comprises three couples . Alex ( Craig Fairbrass ) and his tasty girlfriend Rachel ( Jennifer Calvert , whom I used to have a big crush on when she played Karen Hanson a mean-spirited fast food restaurant boss in the children's comedy T . V . series ' Spatz ' that I used to watch after school ! ) . Linda ( Toni Barry ) and her boyfriend Paul ( Robert Firth ) plus Christine ( Margot Steinberg ) and Mark ( William Marsh ) . It's made perfectly clear in the opening sequence that they are drug smugglers with 600 kilo's of dope on board . All of a sudden , after the opening credits , they are all drifting out at sea in a lifeboat in the middle of the night and it's lashing down with rain . Did I miss something ? What happened to the yacht ? Since the filmmakers probably didn't have the budget to blow the yacht up the six characters just ' discuss ' it on the lifeboat and argue about who's fault it is . Soon after this extremely awkward plot jump they come across a dead body floating in the sea , the name tag says Duncan Jarman ( playing himself ! ) and he appears to be some sort of security officer . Suddenly the lifeboat hits a large structure in the sea , it's one of the huge metal legs belonging to an oil rig . Within a few minutes everyone is safely aboard . Going by first impressions , it seems that the oil rig is deserted . They come across some sort of ' biological research lab ' . Looking at some of the computer screens they conclude that some sort of DNA genetic engineering experiments have been taking place . They decide to stay at least until the morning , and they all find cabins to sleep in . Both Paul and Mark are heroin addicts . While trying to deliver some heroin to Mark , Paul is chased by something rather nasty and slimy . The others search for him . Instead of Paul they find a Dr . Shelly ( Nigel Pegram ) who warns them to leave . To confuse things even further on their travels they also come across a Dr . Carol Soames ( Jordan Page ) and a security officer named Jerry Buckley ( Ricco Ross ) , both of whom act strange and make no sense . Eventually Alex conveniently finds a video tape with the message ' play me ' . On it is a filmed message from Dr . Shelly who rather helpfully says that he and his scientific team have created a genetic mutant with human DNA that kills and adopts it's victims DNA and any individual survival characteristics that might be of use to it , and for it to evolve at an incredible rate . In it's true form becoming more and more mutated and freakish after each victim , victim's that it is able to replicate perfectly . The project was called ' Proteus ' . One by one the heroin smugglers become victims until the oil rigs owner , Leonard Brinkstone ( Doug Bradley ) turns up by helicopter . Will there be anyone left on the oil rig to greet him ? Or will ' Proteus ' escape the isolation of the rig and infect the outside world ? Who know's , watch it too find out ! Directed by Bob Keen I thought this was a perfectly entertaining horror film . It closely resembles John Carpenter's the Thing ( 1982 ) , with it's shape-shifting monster that can turn into anything it infects . And the isolated setting , in this case the oil rig . The script by John Brosnan from his own novel ' Slimer ' as Harry Adam Knight , is fairly well paced , everyone is on the rig and being chased by the monster within 10 or 15 minutes and there aren't many dull stretches . It's a little on the clichéd side though , and there isn't a single original idea in the whole film . But it does what it sets out to do rather well . There is a plot twist towards the end in which certain characters motives and identities are revealed to be different than first thought , but this revelation means nothing to the overall story and is rather wasted . Acting is OK , Fairbrass is alright as the hero and it was cool seeing Calvert again after all these years ! The effects are pretty good , the monster is shown during the last 10 minutes or so and looks decent with quite good movement , but it looks a little silly as the original host for the DNA was a shark and to resemble a shark it has a pointed head , unfortunately this gives the impression of it having a big nose ! Well , that's what I couldn't help thinking anyway . There's not much gore in it except when someone has their throat ripped out , most of the deaths are of the slimy variety rather than having lots of blood . Generally the film is well made , but I think there may be a problem with the sound as the dialogue is virtually indistinguishable in certain scenes , I had to turn the volume up on my T . V . to hear what people were saying but this has the unwanted side-effect of the music and sound effects being loud enough to wake the dead ! Most scenes are lit with bright neon lights , mostly blues that I thought looked really cool . It isn't a masterpiece by any means , but if your looking for a decent time waster then you could do a lot worse than this , worth a watch for horror fans if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on T . V . for free . Entertaining enough , even with it's limited ambition .
498723	1355507	82213	6.0	" We don't want that piece of snot aboard our spaceship . " Nothing special but one or two memorable moments help it .	The Creature Wasn't Nice starts in outer space where the U . S . spaceship Vertigo is on a mission to , well I don't know actually & we never find out . The ship & crew come across a previously unknown & undiscovered planet which Dr . Stark ( Patrick Macnee ) is very exited about , Captain Jamieson ( Leslie Nielsen ) organises an expedition to the surface which is there in no time whatsoever . The team find a small purple blob of jelly which Stark insists he takes back to the ship to study , they get back to the Vertigo & continue on their way . As Dr . Stark studies the blob of jelly he notices that it is growing at an amazing rate until the point where it has become a huge slimy one eyed alien creature that likes to eat people . Captain Jamieson , morale officer Annie McHugh ( Cindy Williams ) , mechanic Rodzinski ( Gerrit Graham ) & trainee John ( Bruce Kimmel ) are now on the creatures menu & must figure a way out to destroy the lump of carnivorous jelly before it eats them all . . . Written , staring & directed by Bruce Kimmel who was also responsible for the songs in the film I thought The Creature Wasn't Nice wasn't anything special but it has a few things going for it that just about saved it from being a complete waste of time as far as I was concerned . The script takes a while to get going & it's not until the 50 minute mark that the alien is seen & takes center stage , the film is supposedly a comedy although most of the jokes & humour don't really work . I would describe the film as being a spoof of Alien ( 1979 ) with a touch of The Green Slime ( 1969 ) & The Blob ( 1958 ) thrown in there for good measure , personally I reckon it would have worked better & had been vastly more successful if it had taken itself a bit more seriously & tried to pay homage to the men in rubber monster suits films from the 40's , 50's & 60's like Invasion of the Saucer Men ( 1957 ) or It ! The Terror from Beyond Space ( 1958 ) although that's just my opinion . Unfortunately for all it's good intentions The Creature Wasn't Nice just isn't a very good film , it's not funny , it's not clever & not that much actually happens in it . For me the film is saved by the alien jelly-baby itself & it's notorious rendition of ' I wanna eat your face ' while dancing , it's certainly a memorable sight & is funny more in a funny peculiar way than a funny laugh out loud way if that makes sense . Director Kimmel was obviously working on a low budge & pads the latter stages of the film out with lots of dull shots of people walking down the same corridor in search of the creature , actually it's not meant to be the same corridor but it's so obvious that it is with just the identification number changed . The film is also horribly dated , apparently set in the future there is a shot of Leslie Nielsen playing Space Invaders from the early 80's & they still use cassette tapes for music , there isn't a CD or iPod in sight . The special effects aren't anything to write home about either although I loved the dodgy looking creature & thought it was a shame that he never ate anyone on screen . Technically the film is rough , the special effects are anything but & the production design is cheap throughout . I personally rather liked the monster but he does look very fake at times . The acting is pretty bad from everyone ( maybe intentional ? Boy they did a good job if it was ) , Cindy Williams as the lone female is sort of cute in an early 80's way . Nielsen & Mcnee are really slumming it here & must have needed rent money badly , all I can say is was it really worth it boys ? The Creature Wasn't Nice has a few decent moments all involving the big crew eating purple jelly alien which amount to 10 or 15 minutes worth . Maybe I'm being a little generous here but I'll go with a stars ( stars , spaceship & aliens ? Get it ? Forget it . . . ) because of the alien & it song & dance routine , definitely an acquired taste . Overall though I'd say it deserves it's low IMDb score . . .
497106	1355507	21884	7.0	" I am astonishingly sane . " Classic film .	Frankenstein starts with Elizabeth ( Mae Clarke ) confiding in her friend Victor ( John Boles ) that she is worried about her fiancé Dr . Henry Frankenstein ( Colin Clive ) , he talks of nothing but his ' experiments ' & locks himself away in an old windmill to conduct them . They both decide to go & see him along with his university professor Dr . Waldman ( Edward Van Sloan ) to try & talk some sense into him . They arrive late one night , as a thunder storm rages outside Dr . Frankenstein admits that he has created a body from stitching corpses together & claims that he has discovered a way to re-animate the body , using his lab equipment & bolts of lightening Dr . Frankenstein's experiments prove to be successful & his creation ( Boris Karloff ) comes to life . However the monster turns out to be very violent & escapes the lab & begins to terrorise a nearby town . . . Directed by James Whale this is the classic Frankenstein film which all others have tried to emulate , this one set the standard & still does . Released by Universal in the same year as the just as influential Dracula both helped start a horror boom . Based on the novel by Mary Shelley the extremely effective script by Francis Edward Faragoh & Garrett Fort moves along at a nice pace & is never boring , it manages to create a fair amount of sympathy for the monster & has a good solid story that works well even today , over 75 years since it was made . It's debatable whether a better adaptation of Frankenstein has ever been made , although having said that I personally still think Flesh for Frankenstein ( 1974 ) is my favourite version of the tale . Director Whale does a terrific job here , there are some truly classic & iconic images in Frankenstein . The sets are great from the stone castle to the run down windmill to a spooky graveyard . The Frankenstein make-up by Jack Pierce is impressive & is the way everyone now envisions the Frankenstein monster to look like with a flat head , bolts through his neck & stitch work across his body . The special effects are actually pretty good including a burning mill at the end . With a supposed budget of about $291 , 000 Frankenstein is well made & pretty impressive to watch even today , I'd have thought a lot of time & effort went into the film . The acting was OK , Clive's Dr . Frankenstein is a touch theatrical at times but he has a certain madness that seems appropriate . Frankenstein is a great film , it's as simple & straight forward as that . Obviously don't expect any explosions or CGI effects as this is a film which relies on a good story done properly . A must for horror fans & definitely worth a watch for anyone else . A sequel Bride of Frankenstein ( 1935 ) was made several years later & in my opinion is actually better than this .
497907	1355507	118771	7.0	" What would you do with 90 , 000 donuts ? " Very enjoyable action thriller .	Breakdown is set in the open desert as married couple Jeff ( Kurt Russell ) & Amy Taylor ( Kathleen Quinlan ) are driving from Massachusetts to San Diego in order to move house , unfortunately their flashy 4x4 jeep breaks down in the middle of nowhere . Luckily helpful truck driver Warren ' Red ' Barr ( J . T . Walsh ) happens to stop & offers them assistance , Amy decides to get into Warre's truck & drive to the next diner to phone for help while Jeff stays with his expensive flashy 4x4 , while on his own Jeff manages to get the jeep working again & sets off to meet up with his wife but when he gets to the diner there is no sign of her & no-one there remembers seeing her . Jeff starts to panic & with good reason as he soon finds out that Amy has been kidnapped by Warren & his gang & want a $90 , 000 ransom or he will kill her . Jeff is on his own & has to think quickly in order to save his wife as he doesn't have the 90 , 000 the thought of which is the only thing keeping Amy alive . . . Co-written & directed by Jonathan Mostow one has to say that Breakdown is a terrific , taught & often quite tense little action thriller that I personally rate highly , in my opinion it's certainly one of the better Hollywood made thrillers out there anyway . The script is nice & focused , there's not too much extraneous exposition & just about every scene moves the story forward in some way . The character's are simple yet you understand them , for instance we never find out too much about Jeff or Amy except they are moving house & find themselves in the situation they do & that's all we really need to know , the bad guy's don't have any deep motivation or anything & quite simply they do what they do for the money which is all that we need to know . The film has a good pace , the script throw's all sorts of difficult situations at Jeff & it's very entertaining & often fairly tense to see how he overcomes them . The script also has a really good balance , there's some gripping & intriguing thriller elements , there's some nice action adventure scenes , there's a touch of mystery & just enough exposition without slowing things down too much . Overall I liked Breakdown a lot & it's as simple & straight forward as that , if you think about it hard enough there are probably certain things that Jeff might have done differently & maybe considered slight plot-holes ( the IMDb message boards for Breakdown are full of ' why didn't Jeff do this ' or ' why didn't he do that ' type threads ) but that's just nitpicking really since Breakdown is a film so just enjoy it as such . There are some nice action sequences here as a jeeps ends up in a river , there's a couple of car chases including a pretty impressive one at the end & a tense scene in which Jeff has to climb along a truck while it is moving . The one part I didn't like was at the very end as the large truck was hanging off the bridge , my main problem with the scene was what was it hanging by exactly ? There's a bit of violence & some profanity but nothing excessive . With a supposed budget of about $36 , 000 , 000 Breakdown is well made with good Hollywood polished production values , filmed in California star Kurt Russell was apparently helicoptered in & out of the shooting location so he could be with his family in Los Angeles at night . I must admit to being a bit of a Kurt Russell fan & have liked him in every film of his I have seen & I think he's great in this while the late J . T . Walsh makes for a cold calculating villain . Breakdown is a terrific action thriller & for me has the added bonus of starring one of my favourite Hollywood actors , I liked it a lot & definitely recommend it . Well worth a watch .
496824	1355507	286106	7.0	I actually really rather like Signs . . .	Signs is set in Bucks County , Pennsylvania where Graham Hess ( Mel Gibson ) lives on a farm with his his two young children Bo ( Abigail Breslin ) & Morgan ( Rory Culkin ) plus his younger brother Merrill ( Joaquin Phoenix ) , one morning they discover elaborate crop circles in their corn fields . At first they think it's a hoax but there are newsflashes all over the TV which say these crop circles have appeared all over the world , then things turn really sinister when UFO's start appearing in the sky by these crop circles & when footage of an alien is caught on a camcorder the Hess family have to consider the possibility of an alien invasion . . . Written , produced & directed by M . Night Shyamalan who also has a fairly big role in the film as Ray Reddy who ran over Mel Gibson's character's wife I actually really liked Signs . The script which takes itself pretty seriously could be described as somewhat slow at times but I thought the story was engaging & pretty intriguing which kept me hooked . I really liked all the character's here , OK maybe the kids are a touch annoying as they tend to be in films but I thought this was pretty well written with a decent balance between humour & seriousness . The alien invasion stuff is kept to a minimum & little is seen of the aliens themselves , this is a film where less is more & it retains a air of creepiness around the aliens . It's not big on action either & concentrates on the Hess family & almost totally ignores the outside world which is unusual for recent alien flicks which tend to be nothing more than showcase's for overblown CGI computer effects as in Independence Day ( 1996 ) & War of the Worlds ( 2005 ) so Signs is a nice change of pace , I mean there's nothing wrong with huge CGI special effects filled films but Signs was just a nice change . Director Shyamalan does a fine job but then he had a mega budget to help him , for those looking for another The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) will probably be disappointed as Signs is a very different film & doesn't have such a great ending . I thought there were some creepy moments here & the restraint in the usage of CGI here helps create an ominous atmosphere & leaves something to the audiences imagination which is a novelty these days . What CGI is here is very good & the alien when eventually seen looks OK if a little unimaginative . With a whopping budget of $72 , 000 , 000 Signs obviously looks the business & has that big budget Hollywood look although that huge figure did surprise me a bit as there's not many special effects , there's only about five character's in the entire film & it takes place in the same location for the most part so 72 big ones does seem like quite a lot considering the end result . I thought the acting was pretty good throughout . Signs in my opinion is a great alien invasion flick that tells it's story in a different sort of way , I liked it a lot although I know for a fact there's a lot of hate out there for it . Personally I think it's well worth a watch .
498656	1355507	337978	7.0	Good but not brilliant .	Live Free or Die Hard , known as Die Hard 4 . 0 elsewhere around the world , starts as New York detective John McClane ( Bruce Willis ) is ordered to pick up a computer hacker geek named Matt Ferrell ( Justin Long ) as a favour to the FBI who are investigating a strange computer hack at Washington . However it appears the FBI aren't the only ones interested in Ferrell as when McClane gets to his apartment several heavily armed men try to kill him , McClane saves Ferrell but finds himself in the middle of a plot to throw the entire United States into chaos by hacking into & disabling everything major system like paralysing the public transportation system , all forms of communication , gas , electricity , the internet etc . A disgruntled ex FBI nut called Thomas Gabriel ( Timothy Olyphant ) & his men intend to use the chaos as a cover for one of the biggest robbery's ever , that is unless McClane can stop them . . . Directed by Len Wiseman this is the fourth entry in the popular Die Hard series of action films & is good but not brilliant & if I'm honest I was a little disappointed with it overall . The script by Mark Bomback was apparently based on an ' artlicle ' called A Farewell to Arms by John Carlin & I've heard of films being based on novels but a newspaper / magazine article ? Although when it comes down to it the plot is basically the same as the original Die Hard ( 1988 ) as a group of thieves use the cover of terrorism to steal lots of money . Anyway , I liked Live Free or Die Hard for what it was as it moves along like a rocket which is good since it lasts for over two hours & it prevents boredom setting in , it's nice to see John McClane back in action & speaking of action there's some truly fantastic set-pieces & stunts . However I also didn't like Live Free or Die Hard for what it wasn't , it didn't feel like a Die Hard film with the obvious toning down of the profanity & violence , I mean the villains in this don't seem to put up any resistance to McClane & he simply ends up shooting them , there's no big fights with bone crunching sound effects at all & the violence is very tame to none existent ( although it'll come as no surprise if a longer more graphic version is released on DVD ) . Then there's the main villain Thomas Gabriel who has to be one of the most bland & dull bad guys ever , he's just some young guy casually dressed who only gets to shoot one person in the leg & that's it , he's just not evil enough & who on Earth decided to kill off Mai ( Maggie Q ) so early into the film ? She was easily the best villain & she was a babe as well , at least she could actually fight . I don't know , I liked it but at the same time I was disappointed . Director Wiseman does OK here & he keeps the action moving along , unfortunately by dragging the Die Hard series kicking & screaming into the new millennium ( the last film in the series Die Hard : With A Vengeance ( 1995 ) was made over a decade ago ) the focus of the storyline is all about modern hi-tech computers , cell phones , the internet , hacking , defence systems & it has the feel of distancing McClane from the action , since a lot of what happens takes place in cyberspace there's nothing physical there if you know what I mean & the film tries to make the point that we rely on such technology too much . McClane & Gabriel never meet until the very end either which also has the unwanted effect of distancing them , sure they talk over the phone but it's not the same as an intense face-to-face meeting is it ? The action set-pieces are at times spectacular with cars launched into flying helicopters , chases , shoot-outs , huge explosions & my favourite sequence when McClane is driving a large semi truck under & over some elevated freeways being fired upon by a fighter jet . Most of it is very over-the-top & not based in reality as McClane can seemingly jump from a jet onto a concrete freeway & survive with no major injuries . With a supposed budget of about $110 , 000 , 000 there's plenty of action on screen for the money but that really does sound like a lot doesn't it ? It extremely well made with high production values & great stunt / effects work . The acting is alright but this isn't classic foul mouthed wise cracking Willis , why oh why did Fox cut this down ? Live Free or Die Hard as a stand alone action film is a pretty darn fine one but as the fourth entry in possibly the greatest action series ever it comes across as a bit of a disappointment , as I said I thought it was good & I liked it but I didn't love it as there's a lot of room for improvement .
499395	1355507	91474	7.0	Solid serial killer thriller .	Manhunter starts with FBI agent Jack Crawford ( Dennis Farina ) trying to persuade friend & former psychological profiler Will Graham ( William Petersen ) to come out of retirement & help him catch a brutal serial killer known as ' The Tooth Fairy ' ( Tom Noonan ) who has slaughtered two entire families already . After a few psychological tricks & emotional blackmail Graham agrees , leaving his wife Molly ( Kim Greist ) & young son Kevin ( David Seaman ) behind Graham travels to Atlanta & the scene of the Leeds family murders . As Graham walks around the Leeds house he begins to get a feel for the killer & his motives but he still has little to go on except that both killings were committed on a full moon & the next one is fast approaching . He still needs help so Graham decides to visit notorious serial killer Dr . Hannibal Lecktor ( Brian Cox ) & ask for his help but doesn't get anything out of him . Then Lecktor's prison Doctor , Frederick Chilton ( Benjamin Hendrickson ) discovers a note in Lecktor's cell from the ' Tooth Fairy ' . Graham quickly figures out that Lecktor & the ' Tooth fairy ' have been communicating with each other by use of a secret code placed in a newspaper advert . Once the FBI have broke the code they find it tells the ' Tooth Fairy ' the location of Graham's wife & son , he becomes even more drawn into the case as he desperately tries to unmask the identity of the ' Tooth Fairy ' & save both his family & sanity . . . Written & directed by Michael Mann I thought Manhunter was a good film but not a brilliant one . The script by Mann based on the novel ' Red Dragon ' by Thomas Harris is slow burning & concentrates on characters rather than action . The bulk of Manhunter is made up of Graham's attempts to capture the ' Tooth Fairy ' rather than showing lots of killings , in fact only two people are actually killed on screen & you can guess who one of those are . Forget about seeing Hannibal Lecktor either , he gets a cameo which amounts to less than five minutes & that's it . Not much background is given to any character as Manhunter likes to deal with the here & now rather than the past , having said that the characters are well fleshed out & you care for them which is essential for a film such as this . Manhunter is a good film that has a gripping storyline , is basically well made & is quite absorbing but was a bit too slow for my tastes & thinking back to it now ( I just finished watching it an hour or so ago ) nothing sticks in my mind & not that much really happened when all said & done . Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any , a few gunshot wounds is your lot I'm afraid . The acting is one of Manhunter's strongest points with great performances all over the place from Cox as Lecktor to Petersen as Graham . Technically Manhunter felt bland & unremarkable except for a cool shot when the sun was setting producing a visually great looking backdrop for one scene . I'm not sure about the use of music & songs either , a couple of the songs in Manhunter seemed really out of place & actually annoyed me . So that's it I suppose , there's nothing really wrong with Manhunter as it tells a good solid story but at the same time didn't do anything spectacular or impress me that much . Definitely worth a watch but I much prefer The Silence of the Lambs ( 1991 ) to Manhunter in every regard .
498788	1355507	65491	7.0	A nasty little film .	The opening sequence is set in the middle of some forest somewhere , the local witch finder known as Albino ( Reggie Nalder ) lies in wait . They ambush a waggon full of nuns , they force it off the road and attack the passengers . We then cut to a town square , a large crowd of people have gathered to witness the torture and execution of the unfortunate people from the waggon . A man has his hand cut off and is coated in feathers , while two women are lowered alive into a huge fire , setting them alight . These are the brutal ways of Albino and his gang of witch hunters . As witchcraft has spiralled out of control Count Cumberland ( Herbert Lom ) and Count Christian Von Meruh ( Udo Kier ) are sent to the area to try and bring some order and check the local witch finders methods . The film thereafter is really just a collection of fairly brutal torture scenes , we see various accused have their thumbs crushed with thumb screws , branded , whipped , beaten , forced to sit on a chair of nails , their tongues ripped out , burned alive , beheaded and various other forms of torture , whats not to like ? ! These scenes are presented in a simple way , their there to shock . The film doesn't try to glamorize them , there brutal acts of torture and are presented that way . Directed by Micheal Armstrong , this is a pretty good horror film . The script certainly fleshes out the characters nicely , the Albino character is shown as a total monster , raping , torturing , making up false charges , murdering , and enjoying the benefits like power and money . Lord Cumberland is basically the same , however he justifies what he's doing in the name god , and seems to believe it . Christian is a young man , learning his trade from Cumberland , he falls for a falsely accused woman from the village , Vanessa ( a sexy Olivera Vuco ) . She manages to plant doubt in his mind about his and Cumberland's brutal ways . Corruption is also explored , and how various individuals could gain from having someone accused of witchcraft and basically murdered , technically within the law at the time . A nicely paced mix of brutal torture / action and plot / character development . The film also seems to have very good production values , great authentic looking period costumes and locations , the music's quite appropriate sounding too . Acting wise , Herbert Lom steals the show as Lord Cumberland . If you can make it through the torture , rape and sex then you should be rewarded with a good little film . I liked it .
497441	1355507	477311	7.0	One of the better ' Films to Keep You Awake ' .	Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir is set in Spain where Mario ( Adrià Collado ) & his pregnant girlfriend Clara ( Macarena Gómez ) need somewhere to live . Mario sees an advert for an apartment , it's 140 square foot , it has three bedrooms , two bathrooms & most importantly it's as cheap as chip's . Upon arrival things don't look too promising , the apartment block is on the outskirts of town in a very rundown area , the building is in a state of disrepair & the place looks so bad even the Cockroaches are moving out . However they decide to give it a chance & meet up with the estate agent Portera ( Nuria González ) who show's the couple around . While looking at the apartment Mario notices the shoes he recently threw out & Clara notices a photo of them both , soon they find out that something evil is happening & the estate agent isn't as nice as she first appeared . . . Also known as Films to Keep You Awake : To Let to English speaking audiences this Spanish production was made-for-telly & directed by Jaume Balagueró & one has to say that Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir is one of the better entries in the Films to Keep you Awake series . The script by director Balagueró & Alberto Marini at least is a straight ahead conventional horror themed story from start to finish , it's not any sort of masterpiece but it passes seventy odd minutes entertainingly enough . Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir starts off very promisingly actually with a nice creepy , overcast , rain sodden opening full of foreboding & promise . Things quickly turn sour for Mario & Clara & I was at there thinking this is pretty good stuff but it reveals it's twist too early & then does nothing with it & by the end Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir had become nothing more than your average slasher set in an isolated location with a couple of young lovers for victims & a crazy homicidal maniac & if that wasn't enough there's a pretty obvious & groan inducing twist ending which we could have done without . So the first half builds up the tension , the atmosphere , the intrigue & the mystery nicely with the second half collapsing into tired genre clichés which on the one hand could be considered a disappointment but on the other I am sure there will be many out there who enjoy your average bog standard teen slasher & will maybe like the second half more than the first . At less than seventy minutes in length it moves along at a decent pace , it's never boring , the character's & dialogue are OK even if the villain is a little sketchy & the basic premise is sound . Director Balagueró does alright , like just about every other horror film ever made all the colours are bleached so the whole picture is dark & moody & overcast . At least Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir actually tries to be scary & crank up the tension , whether you will be scared by it will depend on your disposition but at least I could see what it was trying to do . I doubt most seasoned horror fans will have too much trouble making it to the end . There's not too much gore here , someones fingers are sliced off in a garbage disposal chute off screen , we just get to see the blood splatter & that's about it . Like the other Films to keep You Awake Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir was shot in Spanish , because the film is so dark & grey the white subtitles are very easy to read although some don't stay on screen for too long . Technically the film is good , it's well made with solid production values . Filmed in Barcelona in Spain . The acting appears to be alright but since Spanish isn't my language I have no idea what anyone is saying & have to assume the subtitles are an accurate translation which sometimes they are not . Películas Para no Dormir : Para Entrar a Vivir is one of the better Films to Keep You Awake , it starts off very well & then settles down into a rather predictable & routine second half but overall I thought it was a good effort & I liked it .
497634	1355507	307667	7.0	Good documentary spoilt slightly by poor presentation .	The Wicker Man Enigma is a 35 minute-ish documentary that features on quite a few DVD editions of the classic horror film The Wicker Man ( 1973 ) , as far as these sorts of documentary's go it's a good ' un . A lot of the films production team are featured in the documentary , from the director & writer to the stars . It's basically a chronological story in which the cast & crew detail the making of the film & it's distribution problems starting with writer Anthony Shaffer who goes into the inspiration behind the film saying that he wanted to write a horror film but something significantly different from the likes of what Hammer studios were churning out . Various people talk about the making of the film & there's a neat montage here of locations from the film as they were in 2000 , I'd have said as they are now but this documentary was made 7 years ago & it's not unreasonable to think the locations might have significantly changed again . Christopher Lee again claims that he got paid nothing for making The Wicker Man & he still has his contract to prove it . Then it goes into the problems they had with the distributors & that the head of EMI told Christopher Lee it was one of the ten worst films he'd ever seen , it had chunks edited out of it & placed on a double bill with Don't Look now ( 1973 ) which the company also hated . Then there's the tragic story of how all the negatives , cut footage & outtakes were buried under the M3 by mistake before it goes on to discuss how the film is thought of these days & it's ' revival ' . Now , The Wicker Man Enigma would have been a great documentary as it's very informative , the interviewees speak freely & it's not a back patting self congratulatory promotional piece if not for the bizarre presentation . We have all seen films in widescreen on our TV's where there are black bars at the top & bottom of the screen which is fine but on The Wicker Man Enigma there are horrible distracting black bars on all four sides of the frame , why is the question I ask here , why ? It's almost like there's a TV ' within ' your TV & I am at a loss to see why the makers put a huge black frame around the picture , I personally found it irritating beyond belief but there you go . Overall this is a great documentary but why the black frame ? It's a very odd film-making decision & it bugged me more & more as time went by , I suppose it's a small grumble though when you consider it's a free extra on a DVD . Definitely worth a watch if your a fan of the film .
497688	1355507	75005	7.0	This kid's a little devil . . . Classic demonic horror from the 70's that has stood the test of time pretty well .	The Omen starts in ' Rome June 6th - 6AM ' where the rich & powerful Robert Thorn ( Gregory Peck ) is told by Father Spiletto ( Martin Benson ) that his recently born son is dead , that his wife Katherine ( Lee Remick ) is not aware of it yet & that a replacement new born baby is ready if he wants it . Thorn accepts the offer & brings the boy Damien ( Harvey Stephens ) up as if he was his own , shortly after Thorn is appointed the American ambassador of England where he & his family move . However , when Damien turns the age of five things start to turn somewhat nasty . Holly ( Holly Palance ) , Damien's nanny , decides to commit suicide by hanging herself in front of Thorn & his guests . A vicious Rottweiler starts hanging around the Thorn estate , Father Brennan ( Patrick Troughton ) pays Thorn a visit & desperately tries to warn him of his son , Damien freaks out whenever he goes anywhere near a church , Katherine becomes pregnant but loses the baby in an ' accident ' & they hire the nanny from hell Mrs . Baylock ( Billie Whitelaw ) . A nosey photographer named Keith Jennings ( David Warner ) starts to dig a little & becomes aware of the strange goings-on , he contacts Thorn & as they investigate they slowly arrive at a theory that they may be dealing with the Antichrist himself . . . Directed by Richard Donner The Omen is a classic horror that plays well even today , two decades after it's initial release . The script by David Seltzer is a little slow in places but still managed to engage & interest me throughout , the character's are strong & as a whole the story & plotting are solid . The little kid Damien looks real evil but is barely in the film & most of the running time is spent on Thorn trying to figure out what's going on . The Omen was made in 1976 & has dated extremely well , both in terms of story & it's overall look without many hideous 70's hairdo's & clothes to date it . Director Donner does a good job at building the tension & considering the small sounding $2 , 800 , 000 budget The Omen is remarkably well made . The fantastic decapitation scene is one of the best ever committed to film although the rest of the violence in The Omen is disappointingly tame by comparison . The cinematography is great , very classy & stylish . Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his brilliant music & as a whole The Omen has very nice production values & a polished feel throughout . The acting is strong by a good cast , apparently Charlton Heston , Roy Scheider & William Holden all turned down the leading role eventually taken by veteran actor Gregory Peck who hadn't worked prior to The Omen for five years & took a cut in salary , make of that what you want . . . Overall I liked The Omen , it makes for good entertainment & it has a certain greatness about it . Worth watching just for that cool decapitation scene & Jerry Goldsmith's score alone . . .
499263	1355507	465670	7.0	Fine British survivalist horror film .	Wilderness starts in Moorgate Prison for young offenders where a lad named Dave ( John Travers ) is found dead one morning in his dorm after having slit his wrist's during the night . The Guvenor ( George Shane ) isn't happy & is aware that Dave had been bullied & abused by other unmates so in his anger he sends these other inmates on a free holiday to a picturesque isolated island just off the coast for some fun ( some punishment ! ) . Prison guard Jed Walker ( Sean Pertwee ) gets the job of babysitting them but things get out of hand when the mutilated body of a tramp ( Colin Nicolson ) is found , one of the inmates Callum ( Toby Kebbell ) is accused but the group quickly discover they are not alone on the island as some unseen psycho killer begins to pick them off one-by-one . . . This British production was directed by Michael J . Bassett & I have to say that I was impressed with Wildnerness , I didn't think it was perfect but it's certainly an effective little British horror flick with an edge . Wilderness is a well put together sort of mix of survivalist , horror , action , thriller & teen slasher film all rolled into one & it's very similar to Severance ( 2006 ) another British survivalist horror film made the same year but without the comedy elements . Wilderness takes itself very seriously in fact , there's a fairly disturbing opening sequence showing the bullying & subsequent suicide of a young offender in prison ( with which his tormentors are given a free holiday for as punishment ! ) & it's fairly grim going right through until the end with some brutal murders , some really unlikable character's who do some really nasty stuff & a pretty bleak atmosphere . The film has a good pace , there's plenty going on & there's some very memorable moments here but it's not perfect , the fact that all of the character's are so unlikable is a problem because you end up wanting them to die rather than rooting for them & I was disappointed by a fairly lacklustre twist at the end & an all too predictable killer . The film looks good & there's none of that awful slow-motion , fast-motion , quick cut editing , shaky hand-held camcorder cinematography or any colour bleaching which is great , it's nice to see a film shot pretty much ' as is ' rather than have lots of pointless & often annoying post-production techniques inserted . There's some nice gore here too , there's a fair amount of blood splatter , someone is shot with arrows , dogs tear the side of someone's face off & bite his chest & stomach open leaving his insides hanging out , there's a severed head on a spike , there's a slit throat , a guy has his foot sliced off by a bear trap , there's a severed arm , there are stabbings & the violence levels are up to the required standards . There are one or two really great scenes here , the bit when Callum stands looking around by sees nothing then moves away only for the leaves on the ground to move or when the killer slashes someone's throat from behind without them even noticing them there are very effective . With a supposed budget of about £3 , 000 , 000 this was shot in Scotland & Nothern Ireland here in the UK & the locations are nice enough . The acting is pretty solid although some of the accents are a little off putting & feel very forced & at times dubbed . Sean Pertwee is the only cast member of any real note here . Wilderness is a very good film that will have most gripped , the plot is good & the action & gore is great . Definitely well worth a watch as far as I am concerned .
499061	1355507	51706	7.0	Surprisingly inventive murder mystery .	Grip of the Strangler starts in Victorian London at ' Newgate Prison 1860 ' where a notorious murderer named Edward Styles ( Michael Atkinson ) dubbed the ' Haymarket Strangler ' is sent to the gallows & hanged in front of a cheering cockney public . . . Jump forward 20 years & novelist James Rankin ( Boris Karloff ) also happens to be a social reformer & is taking a great deal of interest in the conviction & hanging of Styles , he believes that had Styles had the money to pay for a decent legal defence in court he would never had been convicted & in an attempt to get good legal aid for everyone Rankin decides to prove that Styles was innocent . Along with his assistant Dr . Kenneth McColl ( Tim Turner ) Rankin collects overwhelming evidence that a doctor named Tennant was responsible for the brutal killings , unfortunately his investigation's take a sinister & unexpected turn as the murders start up once more . . . This English production was directed by Robert Day & was better than I had expected . The script by John Croydon & Jan Read , who also wrote the story ' Stranglehold ' upon which Grip of the Strangler is based , main asset is a couple of neat twists & turns that caught me by surprise & it seems a fair amount of thought went into it . The mystery elements are minimal as it's made clear from the start Styles is innocent & Tennant was responsible but even with this basic framework of a murder mystery about half way through Grip of the Strangler suddenly turns into a 50's slasher film with a neat plot twist . At less than 80 minutes long it never becomes boring , the story engages , the character's are alright & is more than watchable . Director Day does an OK job but you have to take into consideration that Grip of the Strangler is the best part of half a century old , I would have thought it was quite risqué at the time with a knife wielding maniac running around strangling & slashing young women to death & it bar in which scantily clad ( for the 50's ) women perform on stage for men . There's a nice period atmosphere to the film & there's some effective scenes . Technically the film is fine with nice black and white cinematography & good solid production design . The acting was better than expected , Karloff pulls a strange face at the end as he is meant to be paralysed down one side & looks pretty ugly if nothing else . Grip of the Strangler is a good solid British horror film that is well worth watching for fans of the genre or fans of Karloff . Worth tracking down .
498701	1355507	681751	7.0	A good crime solving Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Across the Line starts outside the L . A . branch of the Frasier Pacific Bank where Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) is on a stakeout after an anonymous tip that an armed robbery was going to take place , sure enough two men rob the bank at gunpoint . A gunfight between the cops & robbers takes place where one robber is shot dead while the other hijacks a car , he forces the female driver a Sally Tourneau to put her foot down & get him as far away from the bank as possible but another cop called Brian Taggart ( Jack Kehoe ) shoots at the speeding car & kills Sally . It seems like a clear case of excessive force & a bad shooting so Taggart is suspended & more than likely to be kicked off the force , Taggart asks Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to defend him in a tribunal even though he knows Quincy thinks he's guilty . Reluctantly Quincy agrees but all the evidence points to Taggart having needlessly killed an innocent woman . . . Episode 9 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & I think it's a really well balanced one which hasn't always been the case during season 8 so far . I must say that I thought the season started off really badly & hated the first few episodes but things have definitely picked up & this is a good solid mystery with a social message about trigger happy cops which the producers were obviously so keen on including . I must admit I really liked the idea that Quincy has to prove Taggart innocent even though everyone including Quincy himself thinks he's guilty of killing an innocent woman although as a plot I'm not sure how much sense it makes , I mean would you let someone represent you in what is basically a murder trial who has publicly admitted they thought you were guilty ? No , I wouldn't either but it's an interesting notion that makes for a good Quincy episode where he has to use his medical knowledge & knowhow to get to the truth which is actually a surprise for once . At less than an hour in length it moves along at a nice pace , it never bores & Klugman is just so watchable as usual . This one starts with a shoot out between the cops & robbers , some of the ' ordinary ' cops are actually armed with machine guns ! Don't you think the LAPD would have a special firearms unit that carried machine guns rather than give them to your average cop ? Also wouldn't there be more cops besides two in a van & three hidden behind some beams of wood ? It's nice to see all the regular cast , Asten , Monahan , Brill , Danny & Sam all have reasonable sized parts in Across the Line as so far season 8 hasn't been kind to them . The guest cast do a pretty good job here as do the more familiar faces . Across the Line is a good solid & throughly enjoyable Quincy episode , season 8 is definitely getting better as it goes , I liked this one & thought the story was unusual & interesting while still remaining entertaining & Quincy-like .
496861	1355507	129332	7.0	" If you die first I'm definitely going to eat you . " OK period horror .	Ravenous is set during the 1847 Mexican-American civil war where Capatin John Boyd ( Guy Pearce ) is found out to be a coward & sent to Fort Spencer in California deep in the Western Sierra Nevadas , a station for travellers in the middle of nowhere run by a bunch of social rejects & misfits . It's John's first night there & he notices a man outside , the man is helped inside the fort & given medical treatment . The man identifies himself as Colqhoun ( Robert Carlyle ) & that he was a member of an ill-fated party of prospectors who were caught out by the harsh winter , they all took shelter in a cave but quickly ran out of food . Colqhoun then says that they turned to cannibalism to survive as they began to die from malnutrition . . . Colonel Hart ( Jeffery Jones ) organises an expedition to search for any other possible survivors , Colqhoun , John , Private Reich ( Neal McDonough ) , Private Toffler ( Jeremy Davis ) & an Indian named George ( Joseph Runningfox ) head off to the cave to see what horror lie within . Once there they quickly discover that Colqhoun's story is a lie & he is the cannibal , a cannibal who can't get enough human flesh to satisfy his hunger . . . Directed by Antonia Bird I thought Ravenous was an OK film but didn't quite do enough for me . The script by Ted Griffin is a bit of a mess when you think about it , there are supernatural elements involved which are never fully explained , the character's are a bit thin as Boyd hardly says a word throughout the entire film which make sit almost impossible to care about him & the Colonel Ives character is sketchy to say the least , if he was indeed a Colonel what was he doing stuck in a cave in the middle of nowhere ? Is Ravenous a horror film , or is it a historical drama , a thriller or maybe a black comedy ? I think it tries to all of these things but doesn't quite manage to strike the right balance between any of them . There are scenes of people bing miraculously healed & a stupid bit when Boyd jumps of a cliff & survives ( I don't care that those trees broke his fall , from the height he jumped he would have died ) . There are some decent ideas here & in the right hands it might have made for an effective horror , the twist involving Colqhoun & the subsequent confrontations between himself & Boyd could have been great but instead the best the film can do is have Boyd shut a book loudly next to Boyd so as to make him jump , great stuff . I was also seriously disappointed with the cannibal aspects of the story , it's only ever really talked about & I was hoping to see some nice gore , it never happened . Having said all that the film is pretty fun to watch , there's a fair bit to it , there's some decent plot twist's , it's something a bit different , it moves along at a fair pace & it kept me watching right through to the end if nothing else . Director Bird was the third choice to direct & a last minute replacement for Milcho Manchevski who only lasted two weeks into production , she does a fine job & captures the Czech Republic & Slovakian ( where it was filmed in reality ) scenery very well . There isn't much in the way of shocks or scares & while some say Ravenous is a very gory film I have to disagree , there is not one scene in Ravenous of someone engaging in cannibalism , well there is one brief bit but it turns out to be a dream sequence so it doesn't count , the stew scene doesn't count either as it looks like normal stew . There's a gory bit at the end when Major Knox ( Stephen Spinella ) is killed & chopped up on a chopping block but it lasts for a few seconds at most , the rest of the gore in Ravenous consists of some skeletons with bits of flesh & gristle hanging off , some dead animals , a couple of people with their stomachs cut open , a whole lot of fake blood & the best gore scene when someone has their throat slashed open with much blood spurtage as a result . With a fairly restrained budget of about $12 , 000 , 000 Ravenous still had a decent amount of cash to play with , the film is undoubtedly well made , the costumes & period settings look authentic enough & it has that Hollywood polish about it . The music in Ravenous seems to divide opinion , personally I hated it , it ruins certain scenes that with appropriate music could have been so much more effective . The acting was alright , Pearce hardly says a word & just walks around in a world of his own most of the time , Carlyle is great as the villain . David Arquette as Private Cleaves is barely in it despite almost top billing . Overall I was a bit disappointed by Ravenous , I don't buy the metaphor's , messages & moral dilemmas that the film seems to suggest as I couldn't take it that seriously . I think it's well worth a watch & is an entertaining film but ultimately it could have been so much better , good but not brilliant .
498945	1355507	681819	7.0	Enjoyable classic Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Passing starts in a desert roadside diner as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his lab assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) discuss the coroner's convention they have just attended & returning to LA from , a group of rowdy bikers enter the diner & Sam feels uneasy so he persuades Quincy to leave his hamburger & hit the highway . Outside Quincy notices one of the bikers motorbikes has a human skull mounted on the handlebars , instantly intrigued where it came from Quincy takes a look & sees that the teeth were knocked out to hamper identification & that the person who it belonged to probably died from a massive blow to the head . Quincy buy's the skull from the bikers & calls in facial reconstruction expert Lynn Peters ( Zohra Lampert ) to rebuild the persons face , after a bit of detective work Quincy becomes convinced the skull belonged to missing trade union president David Lockwood who mysteriously disappeared two years , three months & five days prior after supposedly stealing two & a half million dollars from a pension fund . Now Quincy has to find his killer . . . Episode 15 from season 3 this Quincy story was directed by David Alexander this is a good solid Quincy episode . I liked the idea behind the facial reconstruction to identify a body & I would have thought this technique would have been pretty new back in ' 78 , in fact you can tell how dated this episode is when Sam & Quincy are talking in the diner at the start & Quincy says that soon they will be able to identify someone from a single drop of their blood ! We've been able to do that for years already . The mystery elements are good & it draws you in although there are one or two issues which I was less satisfied with . For instance Quincy ask's Monahan for a list of people who have gone missing during the past two years , well it turns out Lockwood went missing two years & three months prior so how did he end up on the list ? Secondly as soon as Monahan says the name David Lockwood Quincy automatically assumes it's him even to extent where he visits his wife & friends at that point without any proof whatsoever , to be honest Quincy could have picked any name from Monahan's list & stood as much chance of being right so why did he assume it was Lockwood ? The very fact he was right is surely a million to one shot ? In a way that's like getting a list of the names of 100's of people you don't know or have never heard of , then being told one of them has won the lottery , randomly picking one & being absolutely right with your first guess ! I suppose if you get over the huge leap of logic Passing is a fun enough episode with enough mystery , incident & some interesting detective work by Quincy using his medical skills to justify 50 odd minutes of your time . This one is competently made as usual but rather bland to look at these days . I'm not happy about the plot point where David Lockwood was apparently a black man but was light skinned enough to pass himself off as white , the part of the story where the title Passing comes from . I'm sorry but by definition a black man has dark skin & I find it very hard to believe anyone of that origin could be light enough to pass themselves off as white , even back in ' 78 I doubt many people were convinced by this part of the plot . The acting is OK , Simon Oakland who played Sal Jarrett makes the first of his four guest appearances on Quincy where he played four different character's in four different episodes ranging from a US senator to a car mechanic ! Passing is a good Quincy episode , your going to have to get over a few plot holes & some rushed logic but overall I liked this one . A must for fans of the show .

E . : Sugar and Spice starts as fashion model Gretchen Stone ( Lori Street ) collapses & dies of a heart attack under the hot lights during a shoot , L . A . coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is on the case but can find no logical reason why Gretchen would suddenly die of a heart attack . Upon talking with Gretchen's sister Penny ( Lisa Jane Persky ) Quincy discovers Gretchen was on a new sort of diet & he becomes convinced that the diet along with drugs she was using caused Gretchen's heart attack . By a strange coincidence Quincy is scheduled to appear on a TV talk show to discuss the safety of plastic surgery but Corinne O'Connor ( Kathleen Nolan ) the inventor of the diet which killed Gretchen is also due to appear on the show & when they both meet they argue & Quincy accuses her diet of being a killer on national TV which gets him into lots of trouble . . . Episode 17 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed Georg Fenady & is one of those Quincy stories which has a central moral issue which revolves a tragedy that Quincy is investigating , in fact there is no crime element in Sugar and Spice at all but don't let that put you off . From a personal point of view even though I love the series I don't normally like these episodes which focus almost entirely on a social or moral issues as I prefer a good murder mystery but I thought this one was pretty good , it's not overly subtle & it's a touch predictable but it gets it's worthwhile message about dieting across effectively enough & the fact that the show does tackle these issues & can vary from murder mysteries to something completely different yet still retain it's entertainment value is one of the reasons why I like Quincy so much . Then there's the fact you get to see Quincy act like a bull in a china shop which is always great fun as Klugman does such a fantastic job of playing him & he gets to make his obligatory passionate speech of which there's at least a couple here . There's a guy in this who plays a photographer & he must have one of the worst ginger handlebar moustaches I've ever seen ! This episode keeps moving at a decent pace , it has some nice humour & Dr . Asten gets a slightly bigger role than normal . The guest cast do OK here , there is no crime in this one so neither Lt . Monahan & Sgt Brill feature until the closing ' feel good ' scene at Danny's at the end . Sugar and Spice is yet another top Quincy episode , I love the series & I could watch Klugman all day long so maybe I'm biased but what the hell I reckon this show is definitely worth watching .

E . : Stolen Tears starts as Jew & Holocaust survivor Issac Koviac ( Tha Wyenn ) is run down & killed in what seems like an open & shut case of hit-and-run , however before he was killed Issac managed to get a written note to his friend & fellow Holocaust survivor Hyam Sigerski ( Martin Baslam ) saying that he saw one of the sadistic German prison guards from the Auschwitz concentration camp where they were held during World War II somewhere in Los Angeles . Hyam believes Issac was killed deliberately by this German guard to silence him & prevent his exposure , Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) & the LAPD aren't interested so in desperation Hyam talks to Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who performed Issac's autopsy to try & convince him it was murder . Meanwhile an organisation lead by Cornelius Sumner ( Norman Lloyd ) is on a campaign to discredit people like Hyam & spread the filthy propaganda that the Holocaust never happen & it was all lies , doctored video footage & photo's plus false confessions . . . Episode 18 from season 7 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & is one of those Quincy episodes where he has to use his medical expertise & detective skills to solve a crime as well as use his stiff moral backbone to confront & tackle a serious issue & I guess they don't come much more political , serious or sombre then the systematic extermination of over 6 million Jews in German concentration camps during the second World War but this is Quincy & he doesn't shy away from anything even an issue as heartfelt & emotional as this . To be honest this is quite a heavy issue & a surprising subject matter for the show to deal with but the one thing I really like about Quincy is the diversity of subjects & issues it can & does tackle , of course I think the show is at it's best when it mixes a solid social issue around an intriguing & entertaining murder mystery which Stolen Tears does quite effectively . I couldn't help thinking that maybe the issue of German concentration camps might be a little heavy for Quincy & at only 50 odd minutes in length it doesn't quite have the time to address some of the issue it raises but as a big fan of the show I still liked this episode all the same & it's as simple & straight forward as that . As usual the show is competently made if a little cheap looking , I doubt the makers had much of a budget or a lot of time . This particular episode also gives the viewer a rare chance to see the inside of Danny's restaurants public toilets which I think has never happened before or since ! The acting here is OK , Klugman as Quincy is just class & I could watch him all day while the guest stars do OK but aren't anything special . Stolen Tears is a pretty sombre Quincy which deals with a difficult & still quite sensitive subject , I can't say it does it complete justice but it tries & there's time for a neat little murder mystery in between all the politics as well .

That isn't Quincy's only problem though as the ship has been refused entry to any country for fear of an epidemic by local authorities & when his close friend Dr . Janet Carlyle ( Diana Muldaur ) becomes one of the victims it becomes personal for him as he faces a race against to prevent her & anybody else's death , but is it already too late . . . Episode 4 from season 7 this two part Quincy story was directed Daniel Haller & while this episode wasn't quite as good as Part 1 overall it's still a good Quincy mystery across it's two parts . The script goes a little off track here as the first half features a dull subplot about two defected Russians & the fact that the two actors portraying them put in terrible performances along with truly awful accents don't help . Then about halfway through they disappear never to be seen again , most of the set up in Part 1 doesn't really come to much like the crew making a film on-board who get a couple of brief scenes here but nothing that important & I also felt the eventual conclusion was a bit rushed where things were wrapped up a bit quickly & a bit conveniently . Having said that it's still a decent episode , Klugman is always watchable & there's no moral issues in this story . Shot mostly on a real cruise ship none of this story is set in the laboratory which makes for a change if nothing else . Sam & Mark feature during the first half of this episode but the other regular cast don't appear until the final feel good moment at Danny's which is as cheesy as ever . Slow Boat to Madness : Part 2 isn't quite as good as part 1 but over the two 50 odd minute episodes I'm going to rate it a throughly respectable & entertaining , I liked it & I'm sure there are many other's out there who will too .
498720	1355507	610961	7.0	" We are all interested in the future for that is where you & I are going to spend the rest of our lives . " Affectionate look at the life & career of Edward D . Wood Jr .	The Incredibly Strange Film Show : Ed Wood , or ' The Son of The Incredibly Strange . . . ' as it's on screen title says , is a 40 odd minute documentary focusing on the life , the career & the death of the infamous Edward D . Wood Jr . . Originally aired here in the UK during 1989 this was episode 1 from season 2 of the short lived TV series The Incredibly Strange Film Show that looked at a variety of oddball filmmakers . This particular episode focuses on the so-called worst director of all time Ed Wood , to be honest I can't see why he merits so much attention or notoriety as his films are simply terrible & being branded as the worst director of all time is nothing to be proud of but each to their own I suppose . As well looking at his films including Glen or Glenda ( 1953 ) , The Bride of the Monster ( 1955 ) & Plan 9 From Outer Space ( 1959 ) it delves into his personal life revealing he was a transvestite & that he died on his own , homeless & penniless in Hollywood . There are filmed interviews with his ex-wife who says he never saw a penny from any of his films , Vampira who appeared in Plan 9 , Paul Marco who also appeared in several of his films & leading lady from Night of the Ghouls ( 1959 ) Valda Hansen which are both affectionate , candid & sometimes sad like Marco's recollections of Bela Lugosi injecting himself with drugs to satisfy his addiction . Overall this is a good solid informative , entertaining & heartfelt documentary that is a must for Ed Wood fans . Shot in Hollywood this , like other Incredibly Strange Film Show episodes , visits some relevant locations & interviews quite a few people who are no longer with us so this documentary couldn't be made today . In fact unlike the rest of the episodes in The Incredibly Strange Film Show's two season stint this is the only one where the main focus of the documentary was dead at the time it was made & could therefore be considered a retrospective piece . There is one hilarious anecdote when someone says that the flying saucers from Plan 9 look like metal pie dishes but has subsequently discovered that the films budget didn't stretch to metal pie dishes & they were actually two paper plates stuck together ! There is also some awful looking footage from the Plan 9 From Outer Space musical which looks absolutely terrible . This is another great show from this great series & series producer & host Jonathan Ross clearly loves the genre , if your a fan of strange films & exploitation cinema then this is a must . It's also a must for Ed Wood fans , if such things exist . This is a notoriously hard series to track down , only illegal bootleg DVD-R's & domestic off-air recordings made at the time it was originally broadcast are currently available which is a shame .

Quincy then thinks that there may be a mercy killer at Valleyview murdering terminally ill patients but no-one will believe him & without any evidence he has nowhere to go . . . Episode 12 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & is a very entertaining murder mystery with which to pass fifty odd minutes . Here the sensitive & emotive issue of euthanasia & mercy killing is brought up but while in later seasons of Quincy this issue would have been explored much deeper , dominated proceedings & been the moral issue of the week here in Valleyview it is merely used as a backdrop & motive for multiple murder that Quincy has to use his medical knowledge & skills to solve & as such doesn't go to much into the moral & social issues , implications & arguments surrounding the delicate topic which is fine with me since I much prefer the murder mystery themed Quincy episodes than the overly heavy handed moralistic ones . Valleyview is solid throughout , there's a steady stream of murder victims , there's a strong mystery element , the final outcome isn't too obvious & will probably keep you guessing until the end , there's the scenes where Quincy comes up against & fights bureaucracy , there's the scenes where no-one will believe Quincy & his ideas & there's that trademark Quincy humour . Pretty much all any Quincy fan would want from an episode really . There's nothing that is particularly memorable in this episode , it's well made but somewhat flat & a bit bland . Have you ever noticed the production team use the same still shot of Quincy's car parked outside Danny's ? I'm sure it's just a single stock photograph that they use as a quick establishing shot to show that Quincy is at Danny's in the same way all the exterior shot's of Quincy's building look exactly the same ! The acting is alright here so there's no problems on that front , TV & Hollywood veteran Ed Begley Jr . makes his first of three Quincy guest appearances & would next feature in the excellent No Way to Treat a Body ( 1978 ) during season four while Carolyn Jones made this the same year she starred in Tobe Hooper's one time ' video nasty ' here in the UK the sleazy killer man eating Crocodile flick Eaten Alive ( 1977 ) . Valleyview is a good solid early Quincy murder mystery that has a hint of a moral message but thankfully doesn't let it overshadow or dominate the mystery crime elements .
499391	1355507	610972	7.0	Two Incredibly Strange Film Show's in one !	The Incredibly Strange Film Show : Tsui Hark & Stuart Gordon , or ' Son of the Incredibly Strange . . . ' to give it it's full title , is a 40 odd minute documentary that for the first 20 minutes focuses on the weird world of Chinese Hong Kong cinema & in particular writer , actor & director Tsui Hark . Once the commercial break is over ( when it was originally broadcast here in the UK anyway ) the show switches to Los Angeles & Hollywood to focus on director Stuart Gordon & in particular his classic splatter film the rather fabulous Re-Animator ( 1985 ) . Originally aired during 1989 here in the UK on Channel 4 this was episode 4 from season 2 of the criminally short lived The Incredibly Strange Film Show presented by a young looking Jonathan Ross who has gone on to become one of the UK's biggest celebrities . The first half of this episode is about the Chinese film industry , although Ross interviews Hark the show covers a broad range of Hong Kong fantasy cinema . Personally I'm not a big fan of Asian cinema & therefore I found this part pretty dull , sure there are the usual nice interviews with various people , plenty of clips ( none of which made me want to watch any of the films presented & in fact put me off Asian fantasy films even more ) & nice location reporting form Hong Kong itself but I'm just not that interested in the subject matter . It's also odd to hear Hark say he has no intention of defecting to Hollywood to make films almost 10 years before he actually did & made the two Jean-Claude Van Damme flicks Double Team ( 1997 ) & Knock Off ( 1998 ) . The show improves from my point of view dramatically as the second half concentrates on Stuart Gordon & his splatter flick Re-Animator , this part was far more interesting & since I'm a huge Re-Animator fan this is just great stuff . The questions Ross puts to him are relevant & Gordon's answers are clear , concise & he doesn't stray off topic . Another great episode from a great series . Again this is actually shot on location in Hong Kong for the Tsui Hark part & Hollywood for the Stuart Gordon interview . While in Hollywood Ross also visits the set of Bride of Re-Animator ( 1990 ) which was being filmed at the time he was there , interviews with director Brian Yuzna & star Jeffrey Combs are forthcoming . There are some nice behind-the-scenes stuff on the set & Ross also interviews special make-up effects man John Carl Beuchler & there is a quick glimpse of some of his effects in his workshop including the Jason Voorhees mask from Friday the 13th Part VII : The New Blood ( 1988 ) & he makes a mechanical Troll from Troll ( 1984 ) sing during the end credits . Another visually interesting & well put together documentary . This is a great documentary , if your a fan of both Chinese fantasy films & Stuart Gordon then you'll be happy as a pig in sit . While not a big fan of the Hong Kong stuff the Stuart Gordon Re-Animator interview more than makes up for it . This is a very rare series that has never been released on VHS or DVD , apart from illegal bootleg copies taken from off-air recording of the original broadcasts . If you can find a copy & you like cult films then this , as is the whole 12 episodes over it's 2 seasons , is a must .
499313	1355507	681867	7.0	" I've got a clock in my head , every tick is like a time-bomb in my mind ! " Classic Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Tissue of Truth starts as Los Angeles cops Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) & Sgt . Brill ( Joseph Roman ) are in the middle of a kidnap case , a young 18 year old boy named Bobby Stoddard ( Steve Burns ) has been abducted by John Westman & he is demanding $500 , 000 from his parents Robert ( Craig Stevens ) & Amanda ( Lenka Peterson ) for his safe return . Weston says that he has buried Bobby in an underground vault with only 36 hours worth of air , unfortunately before Weston can reveal Bobby's location he is involved in a car accident & dies . The only person on Earth who knows where Bobby is has been killed , step in LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who is determined to use his medical & forensic skills to unravel the clues left by Weston & find out where Bobby is , but as time rapidly runs out & with a 200 mile radius to narrow down can Quincy save Bobby ? Episode 6 from season 3 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is one of those episodes which all those people who think Quincy is all about solving murders should watch , I've always said as a series Quinmcy had a wide variety of story lines & wasn't afraid to tack serious social issues & it's a myth that every episode is centered around a murder which Tissue of Truth proves beyond a shadow of a doubt . I liked Tissue of Truth , I really liked the story about Quincy having to use his expertise to figure out where Bobby was & I liked the feeling of a ' race against time ' situation as Bobby slowly ran out of air . However I didn't like all the co-incidences & all the guess work going on here , I mean for instance the police sketch artist who draws virtually a perfect picture of Louise from being told nothing more than this mystery woman has a scar , wears glasses , has long blonde hair & has good jaw alignment ! I'm sorry but those are very vague features to then go on & draw an exact likeness of Louise who he had never met needs one to suspend their disbelief . Then there's the scene when Quincy finds a puddle in a 100 square mile part of San Marco valley at night using a spotlight ! Rather lucky I thought & of course it was the exact puddle that Westman drove his car through . Also there are lots of assumptions & things which didn't quite work for me , the stain on Westman's pants for instance as he could have got that from literally anywhere . The sunflower pollen in his nasal cavity , again he could have got that from anywhere . I liked the story but I didn't like some of the very shaky plot points , I suppose it's a toss up between the two & since I like Quincy as a series I am probably more likely to forgive some silly & downright unrealistic plotting once in a while which Tissue of Truth has it's fair share of . Again like almost every episode from season 3 there's no Danny or his restaurant even though he's mentioned by name at one point . This is well made if rather basic , there's a reasonable car chase & crash in this one too . The acting is good from most of the cast , as usual the regulars are better than the guest stars . Tissue of Truth is a great Quincy episode , sure the actual science in this one isn't great in fact it's terrible but the story is cool & pretty gripping . I liked it , so sue me .
499063	1355507	681856	7.0	" This is more interesting than the anatomy of a bicuspid . " Quincy solves a murder committed with a frozen hot dog !	Quincy M . E . : The Hot Dog Murder starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is giving a lecture at a local University , afterwards he is approached by a dental student named George Talbot ( Jonathan Segal ) , he ask's Quincy to take a look at his findings from the autopsy of maximum security prisoner John Kendall who donated his body to the University for experimentation . Officially Kendall died from natural causes but while dissecting him George found a frozen hot dog in his throat & evidence that it had been forced down there & therefore choking him . Quincy agrees with George's findings & sets out to prove that Kendall was murdered to silence him , but finding proof proves difficult as he tries to uncover the truth of the hot dog murder . . . Episode 9 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Alex March & is a good solid early Quincy murder mystery with a little bit of humour & quirkiness thrown in for good measure . The main aspect of The Hot Dog Murder is obviously the unusual method of murder used , I would imagine there aren't many people killed with a frozen hot dog ! Like a lot of the early episodes from the first couple of seasons a fair amount of the action takes place outside the traditional laboratory setting , here Quincy volunteers to become a prison doctor ( a plot reused in House of No Retrurn during season four ) to gain entry & do a little detective work in order to catch a killer . All in all this is a really good murder mystery & there isn't a moral or social issue in sight . Having said that Quincy as a character was still being developed & he does some uncharacteristic things like deliberately stealing confidential X-rays , torturing an inmate with electricity to gain information & spiking someone's drink in order to give them severe stomach & chest pains in an attempt to make him think he was dying ( Quincy also gives him a set of rosary beads & shouts ' hurry up I've got a man dying back here ' to the ambulance driver ) which when you think about it is a really nasty thing to do & only tells him that he isn't dying when he admits to the murder . I mean he phones an ambulance up to take him to hospital which ties the ambulance up if anyone else needed it & then puts him in a room which ties the room up & all the equipment inside & again I ask what if there was a genuine need for that room or equipment ? Also I would like to know what happened to the large envelope stuffed with money Brandise tries to bribe Quincy with ? He gives it to Sam for safekeeping & then it's never mentioned again so what did they do with it ? Maybe they split the cash between themselves ? This episode is well made & there's a half decent fight in it but it's not exactly stylish or memorable in that regard . The acting is fine form most of the cast . The Hot Dog Murder overall is a good solid quirky Quincy murder mystery that came at a time when the production team were still working the character's out & therefore some of Quincy's behaviour in this is a little odd . Definitely worth a watch & fans of the series should enjoy it .
498397	1355507	82775	7.0	" Of all the nice places in town why'd you bring me down here ? " One of a kind . . .	Mr . No Legs tells the tale of crime kingpin & drug lord D'Angelo ( Lloyd Bochner ) who has the hard as nails Mr . No Legs ( Ron Slinker ) as his bodyguard & as a gangland ' enforcer ' who shoots first & doesn't bother to ask questions later . It's Mr . No Legs job to keep D'Angelo's drug business running smoothly so when one of his drug pushers Ken Wilson accidentally kills his girlfriend Tina when she discovers a load of D'Angelo's heroin in his apartment Mr . No Legs decides to just kill Ken as well & dump both of their bodies . Unfortunately Mr . No Legs didn't count on the fact that Tina's Brother Andy ( Ted Vollrath ) is in fact a cop with the local department , Andy & his partner Chuck ( Richard Jaeckel ) set about discovering Tina's killer & that means getting close to D'Angelo's drug operations which Mr . No Legs isn't happy about & believe me you don't want to make Mr . No Legs angry as I doubt you would like him when he's angry . . . Directed by Ricou Browning ( probably best ' remembered ' as the creature from The Creature from the Black Lagoon ( 1954 ) , how do you go from being a monster in a classic horror to making an obscure film like Mr . No Legs ? ) & also known as The Amazing Mr . No Legs here in the UK this is one unique film that doesn't quite hit the giddy heights that it could have but none-the-less provides a certain fascination & entertainment value . The script by Jack Cowden plays the material 100 % straight , is a bit on the slow side during the first 40 odd minutes & has very little of interest apart from the main title character Mr . No Legs , for most of it's duration Mr . No Legs is a standard implausible 70's cop film ( in fact you could say the story doesn't have a leg to stand on , ha , ha , ha ) about busting up a drug business with little to recommend it except that for some bizarre reason some absolute genius thought it would be a good idea to have a man with no legs to be the films main bad guy , he has shotguns in the arms of his wheelchair , throwing stars & retractable blades . I've never seen anything quite like it that's for sure . Unfortunately Mr . No Legs isn't actually in the film that much , he dies at least 20 minutes before the end & he only has one proper fight scene which comes as a disappointment . I don't know why but I always thought Mr . No Legs would be the hero , you know fighting against all the odds & defeating all the bad guys in his fully equipped wheelchair & when he turned out to be the bad guy I was a bit surprised as I think the film would have worked better with him as someone to root for . Director Browning was obviously working on a low budget & the infrequent action scenes vary , some are very good & well choreographed while other's are slow & sluggish . I must mention the pretty cool car chase at the end which lasts for the whole final 15 minutes , Browning probably didn't have much to work with but he sure tried to put as much action on screen as he could . My favourite scene in the film is when Mr . No Legs is facing up to someone who wants to kill him , Mr . No Legs climbs out of his chair & puts his fists up to the guy even though without legs Mr . No Legs doesn't reach past his waist ! There are several other priceless , strange , funny & bizarre moments in the film but not really enough . Technically the film is a bit rough around the edges , it's reasonably well made but it isn't going to win any awards with bland music , cinematography & production design . The acting is pretty poor , there are lots of dodgy hair-dos & moustaches while the actor who plays Chuck the cop is a William Shatner look-a-like . Mr . No Legs seems to be a pretty obscure & hard to find film which to be brutally honest is no great loss to the world , harsh but true . There are some neat car stunts , a few nice fight scenes & some truly memorable sequences featuring Mr . No Legs as the toughest & meanest guy in the film even though he hasn't any legs . I'm not sure whether to give it a 6 or 7 , I think I'll give it 7 just because I genuinely think the filmmakers tried & it's generally good fun .
497796	1355507	265787	7.0	" How exactly did this happen . . . exactly . " Surprisingly decent little teen horror / Sci-Fi thing .	The Source begins as troubled teen goth Reese Hauser ( Mathew Scollon ) & his Father Jerry ( Johnny Venocur ) look to start a new life in a non discript American town somewhere . Things get off to a bad start as Reese quickly finds himself & his goth lifestyle being ridiculed by just about everyone else , add this to the fact that his Father is the new history teacher , the school principal McKinley ( Ronald Rezac ) is a bit of a bully himself & things are not going well . However Reese is befriended by fellow losers , goth's & nerds Zack Bainbridge ( Edward DeRuiter ) , his sister Ashley ( Melissa Renee Martin ) & their friend Phoebe Lewis ( Alice Frank ) . While out exploring some lithium deposits in some local woods the four discover a magical rock which concentrates all the lithium's power into one stream which , when stepped in , enhances ones psychical attributes as well as unlocking secret dormant powers , Zack calls it ' scionics ' . Zack gains the power of telepathy , Ashley has the power to control others & phoebe has the power of telekinesis while Reese has the power of psychical regeneration & healing . At first they use their new found powers to gain a humiliating but ultimately harmless revenge on their tormentors , that is until one of the group decides use their powers for rather more sinister reasons . . . Edited , co-written & directed by Steve Taylor I was quite surprised at how much I didn't hate The Source , I think that's a better way of putting it than how I much I liked it as I don't really want to give the impression that The Source is any sort of masterpiece . The script by Taylor & Roger Kristian Jones moves along at a fair pace & to be brutally honest rips-off The Craft ( 1996 ) , or should that be borrows some of it's ideas & themes ? I unexpectedly quite liked the character's in The Source , they all have just enough personality to be likable which was essential if The Source is to work as a film & engage the viewer while a special mention goes to the the girls in The Source who are seriously hot which doesn't hurt . Generally it's pretty lightweight stuff , it doesn't even try to say meaningful things about serious issues like bullying , depression , conflicts with parents , theft & friendship that The Source brings up . Instead it skates around them a little which is fine as the acting & writing involved isn't really up to high drama , but we do get lots of special powers being put to good or bad use & where on Earth did the idea of a magical rock come from ? The Source also went into a direction that I didn't expect & a nice climax . Director Taylor turns The Source into a feature length music video . He tries everything , editing tricks , shots where the camera tilt's back & forth for no apparent reason , hand held jerky shots , slow motion , reduced frame rate , the image turned upside down & various other gimmicky techniques . One more thing I have to point out is that The Source is probably the brightest film I have watched , from the garish clothes to the outside scenes where the grass looks so bright it would glow in the dark & for some reason there are flashes of light shooting around the screen all the time almost as if someone was shining a torch on random objects in the scene , very strange & I'm not sure what it's all about . The Source lacks any real violence or gore , a cut arm & a few splashes of blood is about it while there isn't any nudity either . On a technical level The Source isn't too bad considering that the budget must have been small to say the least . It was obviously shot on video rather than film which might explain why it looks so bright , unfortunately when something is shot on video it has that cheap ' n ' nasty look & feel to it . The music sounds like it has come straight from a techno rave CD while generally speaking it's quite well made . Apart , that is , from one or two poor CGI special effects particularly at the end . The acting is decent enough & I think I'm in love with Melissa Renee Martin . . . I wasn't expecting to but I actually rather liked The Source , it's nothing to heavy , it's good fun & provides 100 odd minutes worth of entertainment . Don't get me wrong it isn't brilliant but I personally think it's well worth a watch .
498800	1355507	222812	7.0	Not as good as the previous two but still not too bad .	Beyond Re-Animator starts with an innocent woman named Emily Phillips ( Barbara Elorrieta ) being attacked & killed by a zombie ( Angel Plana ) in front of her younger Brother Howie ( Tommy Dean Musset ) , as the police arrive & blow the zombie away Howie witnesses them arrest & take away Dr . Herbert West ( Jeffrey Combs ) from a nearby cemetery & finds a needle with some strange bright green fluid inside . It's ' 13 Years Later ' & Dr . West has spent those years in Arkham State Penitentiary trying to keep his experiments alive by using rats as test subjects , Howard Phillips ( Jason Barry ) is now a qualified Doctor & has got a job as the prison MD . Howard asks Warden Brando ( Simon Andreu ) if he can have Dr . West as his assistant which he can , their first patient is an inmate named Moses ( Nico Baixas ) who has a heart attack & dies . Howard reveals who he is to West & that he has some of his serum which they use on Moses to bring him back to life . At this point Warden Brando & a journalist named Laura Olney ( the gorgeous Elsa Pataky ) walk in & see Moses as a mindless zombie . Both Warden Brando who senses a ground-breaking discovery & Laura who senses a big story decide to investigate the incident as Howard uses his position to assist West in his experiments , but as usual things quickly spiral out of control & turn into an absolute bloodbath . . . This Spanish American co-production was co-written , co-produced & directed by Brian Yuzna & I thought Beyond Re-Animator was a pretty decent horror film , although not as good as the previous two instalment's Re-Animator ( 1985 ) & Bride of Re-Animator ( 1990 ) . The script by Yuzna & Jose Manuel Gomez based on the story by H . P . Lovecraft moves along at a fairly good pace but does take a while to get going , it doesn't stray too far from the Re-Animator themes & ideas . The character's are OK if a little clichéd . There are plenty of over-the-top sequences & set piece's in Beyond Re-Animator which is what the film is all about when it comes down to it , a prisoner ends up with no lower body , someone explodes , the evil warden gets electrocuted , there's a castration , a cool zombie without any jaw & his tongue exposed , breast biting , zombie rats , decapitation & a babe in a dominatrix outfit who knows how to fight in probably my favourite scene . Beyond Re-Animator never seems to take itself too seriously & it's all good fun if you have the stomach & liking for this type of material . Director Yuzna plays the comedy side of things up a little bit too much for my liking on occasion but films everything with a degree of style & imagination . Technically Beyond Re-Animator is polished & well made although the quality of some of the special effects vary & the use of CGI feels out of place & odd in a Re-Animator film which were always full of fake blood & guts . The traditional Re-Animator theme music is present once again but has been slightly re-arranged by composer Richard Band & the cinematography is fine . Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West is excellent once again , even though the guy is evil you just like him . Spanish actress Elsa Pataky is totally gorgeous & I loved the scenes with her at the end dressed in that cool outfit . . . Everyone else is rather weak & I didn't particularly like Jason Barry as West's new assistant as he is certainly no Dan Cain ( Bruce Abbott ) from the previous two films . Beyond Re-Animator is mindless entertainment , there are enough stand-out scenes to make it highly enjoyable but at the same time it lacked a certain something . The gore wasn't as plentiful as I had expected & it descended into plain silly farce more than I would have liked . Still well worth a watch if only for Pataky whom is seriously hot in leather & high heels . . .
499284	1355507	130018	7.0	" This place never had a murder rate until you people showed up . " I liked it .	I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is set one year after the events of the original I Know What You Did Last Summr ( 1997 ) where Julie James ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) who suffers from terrible nightmares has moved from the small town of Southport & is living in the city with her best friend Karla Wilson ( Brandy ) while her boyfriend Ray ( Freddie Prinze Jr . ) still resides in Southport because of his job . One morning Karla gets a phone call from a radio station which offers her the chance to win four tickets to stay at a posh holiday resort in the Bahamas , all she has to do is answer one simple question correctly which she does . Karla invites her boyfriend Tyrell ( Mekhi Phifer ) & tells Julie she can have the remaining two tickets , Julie wants Ray to come but he says he can't make it so as a last minute emergency invites nice enough seeming Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Very excited they set off & appear to arrive in paradise as the isolated island is simply beautiful , however Julie soon starts to receive notes taunting her about the events of the previous summer & she becomes convinced everyone is in great danger as a torrential thunderstorm moves in . . . Directed by Danny Cannon I'm aware that I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a pretty bad reputation , luckily I'm my own person & I don't pay any attention to reputation so it's with extreme proudness that I announce I really LIKE I Still Know What You Did Last Summer & if you don't agree which I'm positive many don't it's tough . The script by Trey Callaway is your basic teen slasher that were all the rage after the success of Scream ( 1996 ) although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a very serious tone rather than the light hearted one seen in Scream , one of the reasons I liked this is because it reminded of all those old classic slasher films from the 70's & 80's . While most of these films stuck to a simple premise they were pretty popular which is why so many were made I suppose & I Still Know What You Did Last Summer evoked memories of them for me , it's got the thunderstorm , the isolated cut off location , a cool hook handed killer who takes no nonsense , it's got some nice kills with decent amounts of blood & even though it's silly & improbable & they don't always work perfectly I rather liked the twists & turns which added that little something extra to the overall story . On the down side it also retains many of the problems with those early slasher films , the story is a bit one dimensional to say the least , the cast of young American teens are annoying especially Brandy's character who I'd have paid good money to see die , there are the usual fake scares & highly questionable coincidences which do stretch the films credibility to breaking point at times . It certainly moves along at a nice pace , I was never bored , while not the most gripping film ever I did actually want to follow it through & over it's 100 odd minute duration it entertained me & just for the record I also liked the really silly & cheesy ending scene . Director Cannon does fine , I think there's a decent atmosphere here & you can almost feel the warmth of the sun from some of the location shooting . I thought there were a few reasonably effective scare scenes & I have to say I really liked the way it's shot with regular muted soft colour schemes . There's some good gore as well , the killer gets to use his hook by sticking it in peoples hands , slashing their throats , dragging people across the floor with it embedded in their flesh , he sticks some garden shears in someones chest , there's a machete stuck in someones head , people are impaled on a harpoon & someone has the hook shoved through their throat . With a supposed budget of about $24 , 000 , 000 I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has that Hollywood polish about it & it's well made throughout although there is one scene which always bugs me because it could have been rectified so easily , it's at the end when Julie is firing a Colt revolver which holds 6 ( count them 6 ) bullets & she fires at least 8 shots which is psychically impossible because 8 doesn't go into 6 , obviously . Surely someone could have noticed this & just edited the scene down so she fired 6 instead of 8 ? The acting is alright , Hewitt is OK but that Brandy , urgh ! It was nice to see Jeffrey Combs in a small role too . I Still Know What You Did Last Summer seems almost universally hated by just about everyone , that makes me even more pleased to try & balance things out a bit & confirm to a curious world that here are indeed film-goers out here that enjoy I Still Know Whay You Did Last Summer warts & all & if you don't like it sue me ! Followed by the straight-to-video I'll Always Kow What You Did Last Summer ( 2006 ) .

Crucible of Terror starts in a old tin mine forge , an unknown assailant prepares a plaster cast mixture & spreads it over the naked body of Chi-San ( Me Me Lai ) to form a perfect cast of her body & then the unknown psycho pours white hot molten metal into a hole in the cast . . . Jump to London where art dealer Jack Davies ( James Bolam ) is holding an exhibit trying to impress the main investors George ( Kenneth Keeling ) & his wife Joanna ( Melissa Stribling ) as well as trying to sell some of his items . Things don't go so well but one item in particular seems to generate a certain amount of interest , a bronzed sculpture of a Chinese woman by an artist named Victor Clare ( Mike Raven ) supplied by his alcoholic son Michael ( Ronald Lacey ) . Jack ask's Michael if he can supply more of his father's work , Michael says no but he is welcome to talk to his father personally . Jack his wife Millie ( Mary Maude ) , Michael & his wife Jane ( Beth Morris ) all decide to go together & make a weekend out of it . Once there things take a turn for the worse , Victor is stark raving mad as is his wife Dorothy ( Betty Alberge ) & that night someone brutally stabs Jane to death . . . This English production was co-written & directed by Ted Hooker & I found it so bad that it was just so entertaining & funny . The script by Hooker & Tom Parkinson moves along at a nice pace , is never boring or dull & is just so bizarre & funny that I couldn't help but like it . Some of the dialogue in Crucible of Terror is pure gold , " the only spirits you believe in are brown & poured out of a bottle " for instance after two character's discuss a haunted tin mine . There are loads more as well . I also thought the murder mystery elements were cool , I mean you think you have the killer & their motives nailed down but then the twist ending just comes out of nowhere & turns everything on it's head . I just love the silliness of it all . What's up with Victor's wife ? I mean she's probably in her 50's yet she dresses like a little girl , has pig tails plus she talks to & plays with cuddly toys & dolls ! It's never given any sort of satisfactory explanation as to why she is like this but hey , who cares when it's this strange & entertaining . One of the character's commits suicide for no apparent reason & is never explained why . I have no idea why but I liked all the zaniness , idiocy & eccentricity in Crucible of Terror . Director Hooker keeps the film moving , however his red-herrings & throwaway lines make little sense overall . I'm a big fan of 70's British horror & I love the look throughout Crucible of Terror from the clothes & locations to the cars & interior design with some horrible garish wallpaper ! Even the obviously fake mine shafts add a certain feel . I could have used a bit more in the way of violence & gore as well , there is a stabbing , someone has their head bashed in with a rock , some acid thrown on someone's face & a couple of slit wrists , a bit too dry for my liking . With a budget that probably was pretty low Crucible of Terror is generally well made in & around some nice British coastal seaside locations . The best way to describe the acting is over-the-top , Raven used to be a Radio 1 DJ ( anyone from the UK will know what I'm talking about ) & Bolam is more widely known for his role in the successful British TV sitcom ' The Likely Lads ' & it's various follow ups & spin offs . I must admit I wasn't expecting to but I really rather enjoyed Crucible of Terror , it kept me entertained for 90 odd minutes & that's all I could really ask for . I definitely can't recommend it to anyone as I think you need to be of a certain disposition to get anything from it , far from what one would call a good film but a highly entertaining & fun one none the less & how can you not like a film where someone is murdered using a 70's novelty see-thru plastic cushion !

He's actually quite funny as he tries to mock everyone & generally take the mickey . Oh , & he swears a lot too . He certainly has a likability & charisma about him that makes you want more but 7 and a half minutes is all we get . Added to this is the usual behind-the-scenes footage including some of the gory stuff from different angles & as it appeared ' on set ' . Being a ' free ' extra on the Land of the Dead DVD this is certainly worth a watch if you have access to it but it won't stay with you that long & you can't help but wish it was longer .
498862	1355507	87298	8.0	The perfect 80's slasher film ? Maybe . . .	Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter starts as the authorities are cleaning up the dead bodies left by murderer Jason Voorhees ( Ted White ) , he himself was supposedly killed & his body is taken to Wessex County Medical Center . Everyone thinks Jason is dead but they are wrong & it's not long before he has killed yet again & is on the loose looking for more victims . Six teenage friends , lovers Paul ( Clyde Hayes ) & Samantha ( Judie Aronson ) , Doug ( Peter Barton ) & Sara ( Barbara Howard ) plus Ted ( Lawrence Monoson ) & Jimmy ( Crispin Glover ) have hired a log cabin out for the weekend in the Crystal Lake area & become prime targets for the hockey mask wearing homicidal maniac Jason Voorhees who has no intention of stopping his killing spree . . . Directed by Joseph Zito this was the fourth instalment of the highly successful Friday the 13th series of slasher films & there's a strong case to say that it could be the best one of them all . The script by Barney Cohen follows the same simplistic pattern as before but Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter manages to be a lot darker in tone & a lot more brutal than a lot of slashers before or since . The kills come thick & fast , there's never too long to wait before the next victim & the kills are nice & brutal . There's enough nudity to satisfy including a couple of cute twins , the teenage character's aren't that annoying for a change & as a whole the film works very well within the context of what it sets out to achieve . I really like the Friday the 13th series as a whole & this is definitely among the best of them if not the best outright . I liked it , a lot . Director Zito does a pretty good job , he keeps things moving along & manages to inject some tension & atmosphere to the film . The infamous hockey mask barely features in this one as Jason is kept as a killing machine & nothing more , he has no real character or likability in this one . The gore is strong in this one unlike other entries in the series which were cut to shreds , Jason hacksaws someones throat , people are stabbed , have meat cleavers stuck in their heads , people are impaled on various objects , someone has a knife plunged into the back of their head while someone else has a knife stuck through their throat & Jasons death in this one is great thanks to some top special effects by Tom Savini . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 800 , 000 Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter apparently made over $11 , 000 , 000 on it's opening weekend , now you know the reason why this wasn't the final chapter . Generally speaking it's well made & competent throughout . The acting is pretty good all round & better than one might expect from a film of this nature , even Cory Feldman didn't annoy me . Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter isn't art , it isn't going to win any awards & it's not going to change your outlook on life but it is just about the perfect slasher . An absolute must for Friday the 13th fans & those interested in the horror genre .
497577	1355507	681825	8.0	" Dead pigs is just bacon . . . " Classic Quincy episode , one of the ones everyone remembers .	Quincy M . E . : Riot starts as Los Angeles medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his laboratory assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) are called away from their card game at Danny's by their boss Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) . There's a delicate situation at the county prison , an inmate named Ray Stone has been found dead , seemingly beaten to death by a sadistic guard named Bull Stewart ( Taylor Lacher ) while in isolation . Quincy & Sam get down there & examine the crime scene , however news of Stone's death at the hands of a prison guard gets spread around the prison & major league psycho Ed Burley ( Marc Alaimo ) orchestrates a riot in which the inmates take control of the prison & hold the prison guards & Quincy & Sam as hostages . With tensions rising both inside the prison & outside with Warden Tompkins ( John Milford ) refusing to negotiate a way must be found to diffuse the situation before someone gets killed . . . Episode 14 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Rod Holcomb & is one of my personal favourite classic Quincy episodes , I think Riot is one of the episodes that people remember even if they aren't a particularly huge fan of the series . I liked Riot on various levels , for a start in keeping with a lot of season five the main action takes place out of the standard laboratory setting & the majority of the episode is spent in the prison which gives this one a bit of variety . Then there's the funny dialogue , even those these prisoners are hardened criminals like killers , robbers , rapists & the like since Quincy is a TV show they can't swear ! Some of the ' tough guy ' dialogue is truly hilarious to listen to when viewed in 2008 , the harshest thing any of the cons can say is to call the prison guards pigs ! The way someone can coolly say something like ' this could be a real bad scene ' & played absolutely straight is really funny & entertaining in equal measure . You really have to listen to this one to really get what I am saying . Then there's even a decent plot twist as well , just when it seems that Bull Stewart was responsible for Stone's death it turns out he wasn't & there's actually a neat little murder mystery for Quincy & Sam to solve . The resolution of the riot is a little sheepish for my liking , I mean all the prisoners just decide to give up like nice little boy's ? Do you think that would really have happened ? I must admit I am sceptical . . . At only fifty odd minutes this one moves along like a rocket , there's another cheesy comedy moment ending at Danny's , there's another fine performance from Klugman although some of the supporting cast aren't quite as impressive & hike up the unintentional comedy aspect while the production team are still using the same static photo of Quincy's car parked outside Danny's that they have since the fist season ! Either that or Quincy parks in the same spot to the absolute millimetre every time he visit's Danny's ! Riot is quite well made & there are shots from the roof of the prison looking down on the various police cars & such which are very jerky for some reason . The initial riot is never shown , the inmates are seen discussing it & then when Quincy & Sam are about to leave they find out the prison has been completely taken over . Riot is classic Quincy at it's best , it's highly entertaining in a slightly dated but very fun sort of way & there's even a solid murder mystery behind the main action . A great episode from a generally very strong season .
497360	1355507	681824	8.0	Great Quincy episode .	Great Quincy episode . Rating 8 This comment may contain spoilers Quincy M . E . : Requiem for the Living starts late one night as Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) are finally able to leave the laboratory after a long day & head to Danny's for a game of poker with the boy's . However while in the parking lot Quincy & Sam are taken hostage at gunpoint by mob boss Vincent DiNardi ( John Vernon ) , escorted back into the laboratory DiNardi reveals that he has just found out he is dying from lung disease & has less than twenty four hours to live , DiNardi claims that he has been poisoned & that he wants Quincy to perform an autopsy on himself while still alive to determine the cause of the poisoning & who was responsible at which point DiNardi will order that persons death as one final act of revenge . . . Episode 20 from season 3 Requiem for the Living was the final episode of the third season of Quincy & it was a cracking last episode , directed by Rowe Wallerstein this is yet another story which proves how versatile the premise of Quincy actually was & how varied the stories could actually be & certainly during it's first five or six season were . The main gimmick of Requiem for the Living is that Quincy is ordered to perform an autopsy on a living person rather than a cadaver which is a nice twist & one that the series used a number of times as during the eight season run Quincy autopsied animals including horses & goldfish , Egyptian Mummies , murder cases , suicides & even nothing more than a few bones . I enjoy the crime based Quincy episodes much more than the moralistic ones & it's great that there's a murder mystery element here , there's the personal threat as Sam & Quincy are held hostage at gunpoint & there's even a nice little twist at the end which I for one didn't see coming , the killers motives are not exactly brilliant ( why kill someone who has just brought you an entire apartment complex ? ) but it's only a fifty minute episode , what do you want ? This one has a great pace about it , there's some nice interplay & dialogue between Quincy & DiNardi as he tries to convince Quincy that despite his line of work & who he is he is an honourable man . All in all a great episode that Quincy fans should love . As usual this episode of Quincy is not going to win any awards for style but the terrific story more than makes up for the slightly dull visuals . Set almost entirely in the laboratory , we never actually find out what happens to Chuck the security guard . He isn't shown being rescued so maybe poor old Chuck starved to death tied up as everyone forgot about him & his skeleton is lying around somewhere in the Los Angeles county coroner's office ready to be discovered & have a Quincy like pathologist poke around it trying to figure out if it was murder . . . There's some great casting here as the late prolific John Vernon plays the heavy role he is so good at although I can't decide if I liked him better in Requiem for the Living or the amazingly loopy & brilliant Killer Klown from Outer Space ( 1988 ) , Jack Klugman as Quincy is superb as usual but I come to expect no less from such a terrific actor . Requiem for the Living is an absolutely terrific classic episode of Quincy with a great plot , a solid murder mystery where the victim is still alive & some good twists which help make this one of my favourite Quincy episodes .
499389	1355507	681834	8.0	Top quality classic Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Snake Eyes : Part 1 is set in Las Vegas where LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is attending & pathologist convention , all goes well & once it's over he settles down to enjoy the rest of his stay there with his woman friend Lee ( Lynette Mettey ) . However Quincy's enjoyment is rudely interrupted when he gets a call from the assistant manager of the hotel he is staying in , it turns out that there is some sort of disease sweeping through the hotel & dozens of guests are infected . Quincy does his best to help but people start to die , the hotel manager Al Ringerman ( Val Johnson ) wants it kept quiet to avoid bad publicity while Quincy wants it kept quiet so the other guests don't panic leave the hotel & spread a potentially fatal disease across America so they come to a compromise . Can Quincy discover the cause & find a cure while there's still people left alive to save ? Episode 1 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Joel Oliansky & is a terrific way to kick off the second season . A two part story this first part is classic Quincy , as usual whenever he is on holiday or trying to enjoy himself away from the lab a medical emergency occurs & he has to deal with it as well as contend with the usual bureaucracy & uncooperative officials who only look out for themselves . This is also a departure from the murder mystery stories that littered the first season proving the show could tackle a wide variety of issues & story lines . What I like about this one is that it's not political or one of those horrible episodes with a moral & gives Quincy a good mystery to solve , a race against time & some dead bodies as well . It moves along at a nice pace , the character's are good & even at this point you feel like you've known Quincy all your life . There is also a subplot about a gangster gambling all his money away in a casino & a stand-up comedian who spouts some really bad jokes . This one looks alright , it does look dated at times & some of those hair-dos & suits are just plain frightening . The acting is good from all involved & Danny gets a bigger role than usual in this one . One of the few episodes not to feature either Lt . Monahan , Sgt . Brill , Sam or Dr . Asten . Snake Eyes : Part 1 is a great Quincy episode & sets things up nicely for Part 2 , a must for fans & I'm sure a wider audience would enjoy this too . Perfect afternoon viewing .
499069	1355507	681875	8.0	Excellent classic early Quincy murder mystery .	Quincy M . E . : Visitors in Paradise is set in the small rural town of Paradise where Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his friend Danny Tovo ( Val Bisolgio ) intend to spend three days on vacation fishing & relaxing . After checking into their hotel they head straight out onto the lake to fish , another boats pulls up along side them & a young woman named Jessica Casey ( Hilary Thompson ) ask's Quincy for help in proving her father John ( Barry Cahill ) didn't murder her mother Laura . All the evidence is circumstantial , wanting to help Quincy agrees to look into the case & quickly discovers some sort of cover-up & an overwhelming willingness to convict John on flimsy evidence . Local thugs put pressure on Quincy to leave but he is determined to find out the truth & save an innocent man . . . Episode 4 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ivan Dixon & Visitors in Paradise was the first of the fifty minute ( sixty with commercials ) episodes when it got a regular series after several ninety minute feature length ' Mystery Movie ' episodes & is one of the best ever Quincy episodes full stop in my opinion . This is one of those episodes where all the significant action takes place outside the laboratory & Los Angeles in a small town where Quincy & Danny find the locals turn very hostile when they start poking their noses into their business . Visitors in Paradise isn't just a straight forward murder mystery either , Quincy has to prove John innocent , he has to discover the truth & uncover some dodgy dealings in Paradise . There's some really nice humour as Danny gets fed up with it all & as Quincy walks in on a half naked woman in a changing room . The character's are good , the dialogue is fine , it moves along like a rocket , the story is good & isn't too predictable & it's just one of those Quincy episodes which contains everything I like about the show . The half naked girl in the dressing room is actually Jamie Lee Curtis in her first credited screen role & only her second role full stop , she of course would go on to star in the smash hit horror Halloween ( 1978 ) the following year . There are one or two car stunts in this as Quincy is forced off the road & crashes into a shop front ( in slow motion no less ) . The acting is very good & Danny gets to do more in this episode than just about the rest of the seven seasons put together . For continuity nerds Visitors in Paradise features a totally unique opening credits sequence , it doesn't have the large green ' Q ' graphic , it doesn't have the cops fainting as Quincy performs an autopsy , Jack Klugman is not credited during this sequence & it features some alternate footage not seen in the more regularly used one . This not very good sequence was probably made to distinguish the fifty minute episode from the ninety minute ones previous but it didn't last too long & by the time Hit and Run at Danny's aired two stories later the production team had reverted back to the more traditional ones which stayed with the series until it ended six seasons later . Visitors in Paradise is an excellent Quincy episode , some of the medical terminology is a little dated ( they only just are able to tell the difference between male & female blood ) but the murder mystery is one of the best from the entire series , it's funny , it's intriguing & it's just a great episode any fan of the show should enjoy .
498490	1355507	79871	8.0	" You mardy ass little toe-rag . You touch that bell again for no fcking reason , I'll have you down the block before your feet touch the ground . " Brilliant , harsh drama .	Scum starts as three new inmates arrive at British borstal for young offenders , Carlin ( Ray Winstone ) , Davis ( Julian Firth ) & Angel ( Alrick Riley ) are all introduced to Mr . Sands ( John Judd ) the brutal senior officer who runs A wing . The three new inmates quickly discover life at the borstal is brutal & unforgiving , Carlin is known as a hard-case & Pongo Banks ( John Blundell ) the current ' daddy ' on A wing fears competition so beats Carlin up . Carlin decides to take over Banks operation & with the aid of some snooker balls in a sock ' convinces ' Banks & his cronies that he's the new daddy on A wing . However the inmates have as much to fear from corrupt & uncaring screws as they do each other . . . This British production was directed by Alan Clarke & one has to say once you have seen Scum it'll probably stay with you forever . Originally commissioned by the BBC for their Play for Today series in 1977 they refused to broadcast it , this is the TV version referred to in the IMDb's ' Alternate Versions ' section . Writer Roy Minton & director Clarke then went & re-shot it ( Archer for instance is played by a different actor in both versions ) for a theatrical release which is far more violent & has much more profanity in it . I have never seen the original BBC version but it is available on The Alan Clarke Collection as is the theatrical cut as well which is the one I am basing my comment on . Scum is a very harsh & brutal look inside a British borstal for young men during the late 70's , it is unflinching in it's detail & depiction of cruelty , corruption & is utterly damning of a system which was wholly inadequate & didn't work . It's a brilliantly written film , the character's are superb & you really feel for them as people , the dialogue takes no prisoners with lots of swearing & racist insults ( jungle bunny , coon , black barstrd etc . ) that may offend some of the more politically correct members of the audience . In fact the whole of Scum will probably offend the PC brigade . The film presents the borstal as an institution run by violence & fear , both the inmates & prison officers are seen to be guilty of perpetuating the circle of sadism , violence & corruption in a system that is abused by everyone for their own ends . Scum is just a brilliantly compelling , absorbing , shocking & wonderfully written film that tells it like it was & pulls no punches & doesn't try to fool the audience with any sort of Hollywood romanticised ' happy ending ' where everyone happily walks away . The one thing I must say at this point is that I am positive the way borstal is represented here is no longer the case in reality , in that sense you could almost call Scum a period film at this point in time although it was very much contemporary at the time it was made ( these days young offenders in Britain are more likely to have Playstations in their cells ) . The lack of any sort of soundtrack adds to the gritty realism , the borstal is a cold & bland looking place just like it should be . The violence is extreme at certain points , from a very harrowing scene in which a boy attempts to commit suicide to Carlin using snooker balls in a sock to knock someone out to a very unpleasant & graphic sequence showing a boy gang raped . Scum is not an easy ride , it's not a pleasant film to watch although it doesn't set out to pleasant & nor should it . It's scenes of violence are shocking but they have a purpose & are effective in helping to tell a shocking yet always compelling story . Technically Scum is basic but the harsh simple gritty documentary look of it helps immensely , both to make it difficult to watch & keep it very much grounded in reality . The acting is superb from a fantastic cast , everyone here is just utterly convincing , chillingly so at times in fact . Scum ( the theatrical cut anyway ) is a brilliant film & it's as simple & straight forward as that . It's definitely not a film for everyone that's for sure but if you want to watch a challenging film that will stay in your memory for a long time then Scum is it .
498474	1355507	82186	8.0	" Release the Kraken " Highly entertaining fantasy adventure based on Greek mythology .	Clash of the Titans starts with King Acrisius ( Donald Houston ) of Argos ( no not the shop ! ) sealing his daughter Danae ( Vida Taylor ) & her young baby son Perseus in a coffin & throwing it into the sea in an act of defiance against the father of the gods Zeus ( Laurence Oliver ) who happens to be father of Perseus . In anger Zeus commands Poseidon ( Jack Gwillim ) the god of the sea to release a huge monster known as the Kraken to destroy the city of Argos & also tells him to make sure Danae & Perseus make dry land safely . Years later & Perseus ( Harry Hamlin ) has grown into a young man , meanwhile Zeus has to punish Calibos ( Neil McCarthy ) the son of the god Thetis ( Maggie Smith ) for his crimes & evil ways . Zues turns Calibos into a deformed monster who lives like an outcast in a swamp near the city of Joppur where he used to live & was going to marry the beautiful Princess Andromeda ( Judi Bowker ) . In revenge Thetis transports Perseus to Joppur where he falls in love with Andromeda , once again Thetis isn't happy about this & tells Queen Cassieopeia ( Sian Philips ) that in 30 days the Kraken will be set free to destroy Joppur unless Andromeda is chained to a stone & offered as a sacrifice . Perseus sets out on a quest to find the knowledge which will let him defeat the Kraken , a journey which takes him to the Stygian witches , the Isle of the Dead & encounters with various monsters , perils & dangers . . . This English production was directed by Desmond Davis & is a terrificly entertaining fantasy adventure , the like of which they just don't make anymore . The script by Beverley Cross doesn't retell any one particular myth but jumbles several up together & even adds some ideas of it's own . While Clash of the Titans moves along at a nice pace & is never boring or dull the film seems somewhat overly complicated with lots of twist's , turns & distractions which seemed unnecessary while some of the narrative was a bit muddled . Having said that at least it tries to have some depth & it works most of the time . The character's are a bit bland & dull but serve their purpose as the real star of the show are the monsters which are great . I'm not sure about the comedy relief clockwork Owl Bubo though , who at the end turns up with a bandaged foot & mini walking stick under his wing ! Director Desmond does what he can & while the film is competent nothing really stands out except those monsters , of course . The best sequence is when Perseus fights Medusa in her flame lit labyrinth , the lighting is great in this scene & has tension & atmosphere to it . I thought the skeleton ferryman was quite creepy as well . Surprisingly there is a couple of shots with female nudity & a bit of gore as well . With a supposed budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 Clash of the Titans is a well made film with nice varied locations from dark swamps , ancient temples & cities , Medusa's labyrinth & tropical islands which give it an attractive look throughout . The special effects are stop-motion created by the legendary Ray Harryhausen & Clash of the Titans became his last film project to date as CGI & other more sophisticated forms of effects took over . They are generally excellent as you would expect from a giant Vulture , the Kraken a giant four armed sea monster ( actually taken from Scandinavian mythology ) , a two-headed Dog , the deformed Calibos , Pegasus the flying horse & my favourites the fantastic Snake-haired Medusa & the cool Scorpions . On the down side compared to today's multi million CGI effects they come off as a distant second best with a slight jerkiness & grainy blue-screen imposition although they have a certain personality & charm that compensates somewhat . The acting isn't the best , Ursula Andress gets two lines of dialogue during the whole film despite her almost top billing in the credits . Clash of the Titans is a highly entertaining fantasy adventure that I think is well worth a watch , so what are you waiting for ?
499244	1355507	67017	8.0	" I am sure I am the first such experimenter to incorporate the horror of an actual decapitation with the later rejuvenation of the human body " Pure class .	Dracula Vs . Frankenstein starts in ' Oakmoor Cemetery ' on a dark cold & stormy night as Count Dracula ( Zandor Vorkov ) digs the remains of the Frankenstein ( John Bloom ) creature up . The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas . Jodie Fontaine ( Maria Lease ) is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton ( Lon Chaney Jr . as Lon Chaney ) chops her head off with an axe . The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine ( the director's wife Regina Carrol ) is a headlining act , we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical . Afterwards she discusses Jodie with Sargeant Martin ( Jim Davis ) from the missing persons bureau , Judith doesn't receive much encouragement & decides to investigate Jodies disappearance herself . Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr . Duryea ( J . Carrol Naish ) who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family & now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called ' Dr . Duryea's creature emporium ' which exhibits various freaks . One night Count Dracula turns up & convinces Frankenstein to reanimate the monster . Judith teams up with a guy named Mike Howard ( Anthony Eisley ) , a guy known as Strange ( Greydon Clark ) & his girlfriend Samantha ( Anne Morrell ) & they eventually stumble across the truth , which be honest I don't really understand , & have to fight for their very lives against Count Dracula & his silly looking laser beam shooting ring , both Frankenstein's monster & mad scientist , Groton , a dwarf named Grazbo ( Angelo Rossitto ) & a rapist biker named Rico ( Russ Tamblyn ) , whew what a crazy film & I've barely touched the surface of what happens ! Produced & directed by the infamous Al Adamson I loved this crazy , almost unbelievable film ! You can't really judge Dracula Vs . Frankenstein by standard film criteria , instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch . Dracula Vs . Frankenstein quite literary has everything , it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it's face head on , Count Dracula with a silly looking beard & an afro hairstyle , who talks with a bizarre echo throughout & has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth , a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant , a wheelchair bound Dr . Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard , ancient comets , lab equipment that would look dated during 20's , we do indeed see ( well almost as it's filmed in the horrible day-for-night process ) a Dracula Vs . Frankenstein fight at the end , a biker gang & a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend ! The script is all over the place , the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like " your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood " , or a cop that says " if you've got a fireplace burn some wood in it , it'll be a lot better than running around on the streets " to a bemused Judith , Mike & the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue & lets not forget Dr . Frankenstein's mumbo jumbo " we are not butchers . . . we are scientists " , almost every line is an absolute classic laugh-out-loud moment & I loved all of it ! Dracula & Dr . Frankenstein only meet once in the film & generally speaking Dracula & Frankenstein's monster are relegated to bit-part characters as the film focuses on Dr . Frankenstein's experiments & Judith's investigations , which is a shame . Also , the plot is hardly logical , it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr . Frankenstein's serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires & some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining ? The special optical effects are terrible , check out the laser beam from Dracula's ring . I thought the make-up on the Frankenstein monster was OK & it looked quite freaky . There is some gore , a couple of ripped off arms , some neck biting & a few chopped off heads . There is also one brief shot of female nudity . Technically Dracula Vs . Frankenstein is a bit of a mess , there are some awful day-for-night shots , the performances have to be seen to be believed , the music gets on the nerves after a while , the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff . But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs . Frankenstein just so entertaining & loads of fun , & surely that's what watching films is all about ? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it , but I'm not most people am I ? I'll sign off by saying I loved this film , so bad it's utterly brilliant ! ! !
