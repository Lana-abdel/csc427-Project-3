497094	1355507	83901	1.0	Total rubbish , don't waste your time .	Escarabajos Asesinos , or Scarab to English speaking audiences , begins with some silly scrolling text which reads , " long , long ago when there was neither earth nor sky , nothing but a dark , watery mass , there lived a spirit possessing magical powers . One day the spirit took counsel with it's heart and was moved to speak it's own name , brought into being a grand , majestic . This figure-the God , Khepera , whose symbol was the Scarab " grammatical errors aside this piece of text means nothing . We then cut to the laboratory of Wilfred Manz ( Rip Torn ) P . H . D . Physics . Manz is conducting some sort of experiment on an Egyptian artifact that is in the shape of a Scarab . After reciting some silly dialogue nothing happens so Manz punches some glass beakers in frustration and cuts himself . His blood drips onto the Scarab and a shadowy figure rises from a swirl of smoke & bad neon lighting . Jack Murphy ( Robert Ginty ) is an American reporter working in the Spanish capital Madrid , after getting into bed with the wrong woman his editor Raleigh ( Sam Chew Jr . ) says he is going to give him one more chance & sends Murphy to cover a boring press conference by the Spanish Prime Minister ( Hector Alterio ) on ' new morality ' . Half way through his speech the Minister grabs a security officers gun and commits suicide . Murphy notices a Spanish nurse named Elena ( Cristina Sanchez Pascual ) take a small Scarab which had fallen from the Minister's lapel . Sensing a story Murphy follows Elena . After various inane plot devices & coincidences it turns out that Elena is Manz's daughter & that Manz is now the leader of an Egyptian cult ( since it's set in Spain shouldn't it be a Spanish cult ? ) who apparently wants to save the world by bringing back the Dark Ages before mankind destroys itself with an Atom Bomb , makes sense yeah ? Manz & his followers plan on doing this by assassinating heads of state & men in power . I said it was bad , don't blame me . Elena feels she has to stop him , Murphy does too . But in reality Manz has plans for both Murphy & his daughter Elena . Oh , & for some unexplained reason Manz steals some money from a banker named Harrington ( Donald Pickering ) by blowing the Bank of England up . So , in an incredibly lame climax it's Manz & his worshippers against Murphy & Elena in a fight to the death ! First off I should apologise if I've made Escarabajos Asesinos sound exciting or interesting because , frankly , it's as dull as dishwater & about as much fun . Co-written & directed by Steven-Charles Jaffe I absolutely hated this film . I find it incredibly hard to comprehend that it took four people , Jaffe , Robert Jaffe , Ned Miller & Jim Block to write this crap . Four people ? Maybe everyone had their own ideas & that's why it turned into the mess that it did . Maybe there were creative differences , or maybe these four people have no talent & just didn't know how to write a decent horror / thriller . You decide ! Escarabajos Asesinos is extremely slow & uninvolving . I never felt that anyone or anything was in danger , I mean taking over the world by assassinating government figures ? There are only two assassinations throughout the entire film , & then the film tries to surprise us by saying this plan was a front for something else even less exciting and even more boring if that's possible . I hate this film , I almost fell asleep watching it . Ginty has all the personality & acting ability of a peeled Bannana & his falling in love with Elena was hardly a surprise , I mean just once can't the leading man and woman hate each other & resist the temptation to get into bed with each other after less than half a day of meeting each other ? Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a so brief it's almost subliminal cut chest & stomach . There is however plenty of nudity as not only does Manz have a collection of worshippers , he has a collection of young female almost totally naked dancing worshippers , who say things like " don't you want any of us ! ? " ! Manz's lair is totally ridiculous , foam rocks and no walls , just a totally black background that looks like a school stage play with big black curtains hanging down . And there is dry ice swirling around all the time , some stupid looking trees without leaves and some ancient artifacts that glow in the dark ! The costumes look cheap as does the children's face paint they all wear , Rip Torn looks very fetching with silver eye shadow ! There is no atmosphere , gore or excitement during the overly long 90 minute running time . The only good thing I can say about Escarabajos Asesinos is that it is made with a fair amount of competence throughout , bad sets aside that is ! Please do your best to avoid this film as it hurts me to think some other poor soul may have to sit through it , if I can just stop one single person having to endure this piece of crap then this review has been worth it . Avoid at all costs !
498428	1355507	113349	1.0	" He's so blasted he wouldn't know his own mother even if he went to the zoo . " Absolutely terrible .	Howling : New Moon Rising starts out in the open Californian desert as a police Inspector ( John Ramsden ) is faced with the skeletal remains of a man near the isolated locale of Pioneertown . Not only does he have to deal with skeletal remains he has to listen to Father John ( Jack Huff ) who works for the Church investigating supernatural & occult goings-on , Father John claims the man was victim to a Werewolf & that very Werewolf is about to mature into adulthood at which point it will be able to change other's into Werewolves & thus spreading it's race throughout the country . Meanwhile in Pioneertown a stranger named Ted Smith ( Clive Turner , I will come back to this guy later . . . ) has arrived , Ted finds the locals very hospitable as the owner of ' Happy Harriet's ' gives him a job as a barman & they also let him have a room in their motel . However it quickly transpires that Ted may not be what he at first seems as some of the locals begin to become suspicious of him , for instance who was that drunk ( Brett Owens ) who seemed to know Ted & threatened to ' expose ' him for what he really is ? What do the locals of Pioneertown really know about Ted & can they trust him . . . This English production ( at this point I'm embarrassed to be British ) was edited , written , produced , directed & starred Clive Turner who really should never be let anywhere near a film camera again , ever . Howling : New Moon Rising was the seventh , & to date last , film in the Howling series that began with The Howling back in 1981 . The best parts of Howling : New Moon Rising are the bits edited into it from two previous entries , Howling IV : The Original Nightmare ( 1988 ) & Howling V : The Rebirth ( 1989 ) which probably amount to a good 10 or so minutes . The script also tries to tie these films together & even mentions the events from the previous instalment Howling VI : The Freaks ( 1991 ) . Now , as a horror film fan you have to be able to take a chance on a film that you have never heard of but will probably turn out to be complete & utter crap , it goes with the territory . Sometimes you will come across an absolute gem , while other times you find a film that will pass the time reasonably enough & then there's films like Howling : New Moon Rising which are the cinematic equivalent of having your trousers pulled down & having a large vegetable inserted into your rectum . Now I've had my fair share of cinematic vegetable insertions but every once in a while a film comes along so utterly awful that I wonder why I bother , Howling : New Moon Rising is such a film . It is devoid of any entertainment value whatsoever , just take my word for it this deserves it's pathetically low score on the IMDb . Director Turner makes one of the most awful films ever . There is no excitement , tension , atmosphere , blood or gore except in the scenes stolen from the other Howling films & the Werewolf in this one is on screen for all of 30 seconds & I kid you not . Add that to the fact that it's one of the most pathetic looking creations I've seen in a horror film for sometime & this really isn't much of a Werewolf film at all . Then there's the country & western music & the cringe inducing line dancing scenes , don't get me wrong I have nothing against either of these forms of recreational entertainment but here they are just plain embarrassing as every so often the film goes into a line dancing or musical number . The cowboy type clothing , hats , boots & general talk is , quite simply , embarrassing & frankly hideous . There are also elements of comedy like penis size & fart jokes , well I'd didn't find much to laugh at . Going straight-to-video technically Howling : New Moon Rising is rubbish , from the lame story , the unfunny comedy , the naff cowboy character's , the terrible special effects , the lack of any blood or gore & to cap it all off the acting is awful including editor , writer , producer & director Turner who has shoulder blade length hair & silly facial hair . This film is really bad & I've seen some absolute stinkers in my time , it even ends on a nice ' happily ever after ' country & western singalong as the credits rolls . There is not one single aspect by which I could recommend Holwing : New Moon Rising to anyone , avoid at all costs & you have been warned !
497300	1355507	83056	1.0	Awful attempt from Jesus Franco at a jungle adventure / cannibal film .	Dr . Jeremy Taylor ( Al Cliver ) , Jerry to his lady friends ! , is a specialist in tropical diseases . Together with his wife Elizabeth ( Pamela Stanford ) and young daughter Lana ( Anouchka ) he is traveling by boat to a remote jungle Hospital to conduct some research . However the captain of the boat warns Jeremy that a previous expedition was attacked , killed and eaten by a local tribe of cannibals . Some cannibals sneak on board the boat , even though they had to swim across the river to the boat when they board it they are completely dry . The cannibals kill the captain with a spear . They grab Elizabeth and do what cannibals do best , they rip her stomach open , pull her intestines out and eat them . Jeremy witnesses this , the cannibals decide to kidnap Jeremy and take him back to their village . Lana manages to hide from the cannibals and is not seen . Later she is found floating in a river by the tribes leader and his young son , immediately she is worshiped as a ' white goddess ' and is also taken to the village . Once there , the cannibals chop the lower half of Jeremy's left arm off . They cook it over a fire and start to eat it . They are soon distracted by the arrival of their leader and Lana . Jeremy senses his opportunity and makes his escape . He is found and rescued by two men in a jeep . Cut to New York , cue lots of shots of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline . Jeremy is Hospitalized and considered mad , but he does get a sexy nurse , Ana ( Lina Romay ) to look after him and take him for walks around Manhattan . When Jeremy is released he heads straight for Barbara Shelton ( Shirley Knight ) , the president of the Shelton organization who funded his original expedition . He tries to obtain funding for another trip so he can find his now grown up daughter ( Sabrina Siani ) . Eventually she agrees as long as herself , her lover Charles Fenton ( Olivier Mathot ) and some of their rich friends who want to come along for an adventure , can join him . Jeremy's sexy nurse Ana also tags along . While taking some photos of each other Barbara steps onto a severed hand . Jeremy also find his Hospital which has been attacked and all the staff killed . As the remaining group carry on towards the cannibals village they are picked off one-by-one . Directed by Jesus Franco this is a pretty inept film . At least one of the expedition isn't given a name which sums up the depth of character Franco wanted to achieve . The cannibals themselves are laughable , they decorate themselves with children's face paint , and have dodgy haircuts . The village is depicted by two huts . And why do the females in this film wear high heeled boots ? They look good ladies but aren't very practical considering their hiking through the middle of thick jungle . There is also a plastic crocodile at the beginning that looks stupid . Talking of plastic props , Franco uses several plastic skulls that maybe he borrowed from Jerry Warren after he had made Frankenstein Island ( 1981 ) , they don't even have hollow eye sockets . The editing is poor , Lana is seen looking through the window of the boat , the next time she is seen she is floating in a river , thats as clear as mud as to what happened there then . At the end when the main cannibals head is held underwater , when he gets up his hair is wet and his face paint is smudged , in the next shot after that he is dry and his face paint is perfect . The one thing that could have saved this the gore , is also ruined by Franco . He films the cannibal scenes in such a way that they are boring . Unbelievable but true . He uses slow motion , jerkiness , extreme close ups , blurriness , the odd shot in black and white that appear to be placed in there at random , and on the soundtrack he uses chanting , heavy breathing and echoing . It's a shame because the effects aren't to bad , lots of animal intestines , blood , rib cages and fake torn flesh , it's just the way Franco presents it . He makes sure there's plenty of naked flesh around , too . Sabrina Siani is always at least half naked whenever she appears on screen , which isn't a bad thing by any means . Franco has a cameo as a businessman who trades with the cannibals . There are much better cannibal films out there , but this is good for a few unintentional laughs . It keeps moving at a fair pace but overall is very poor . Don't waste your time .
498381	1355507	439479	1.0	" It doesn't matter how ugly the road is , we all have to travel down it . " Could Brain Fix possibly be the worst horror film ever ?	Brain Fix starts with with a narration by Jeff Feud ( Charles Coplin ) who informs us that he has flown to Mexico & drove out into the middle of nowhere to spend the summer in his Father's clinic . However upon arrival he is assaulted by Sven ( Jiri " George " Petracek ) the scumbag orderly who doesn't believe he is Dr . P . Feud's ( Jack Savage ) son . Luckily for Jeff his Father turns up & sets the record straight . Jeff explains that he wants to spend the summer with him & assist him in his experiments on curing schizophrenia & other mental illnesses , his Father just makes him mop the floors which is all he's good for by the look of it . Jeff is introduced to Norm ( Richard Arvay ) , one of his Fathers patients who has been supposedly cured but Jeff isn't convinced as Norm is still a nut case . Jeff also meets & befriends another patient , an attractive female patient named Molly ( Kristin Dean Boswell ) who appears totally normal . Jeff decides to have a look at what his Father's up to so he sneaks into his operating room & is sickened & appalled at what he witnesses . It seems that his Father is conducting hideous experiments with parasitic creatures called Paratosas which excrete a euphoric enzyme directly into the patients brain after it has been surgically implanted into a unfortunate patients head , Dr . Feud hopes that this natural drug will cure all mental disease , I haven't got a clue why so don't ask , but as of now has been unsuccessful . Dr . Feud discovers that Jeff has found out what is happening & together with his new found girlfriend Molly is next on the operating schedule . . . Co-edited , produced & co-directed by Scott Wallace with Jay Amin as the second director I hate Brain Fix with a passion . I see there is only one other review of Brain Fix at the moment & that user has given it , well we were obviously watching different films . Brain Fix is absolutely awful in every single way a film could possibly be . The acting is terrible , for most of this rotten film everyone just stands there & says their lines without the slightest hint of emotion or effort , & when these ' actors ' do try it comes across as totally embarrassing just check out the fight at the end which has to be the most wimpy I've seen as they just sort of hold each other & scratch a bit . Brain Fix is one of the most shoddy & incompetent films I've ever had the misfortune to sit through , basic film-making techniques are either botched or ignored . These filmmakers light scenes from the side which produce glaring shadows in the direction that would be physically impossible if the laws of science are to be believed . For some strange reason half of the sound effects are missing like a gun being fired but with no accompanying blast & a fight with no sound effects either & there is no music whatsoever during Brain Fix even during the opening & ending credits . For the clinic the filmmakers use the same corridor & the same room throughout , one character even says at one point ' all these corridors look the same ' which was maybe an attempt at a joke , well it wasn't funny in the slightest & the corridors look the same because they are the same one used over & over . The one room they use is laughable , it has wooden planks nailed across the window to stop the inmates escaping ! Brain Fix is rock bottom stuff all the way , there aren't even any laughs to be had as it's just so painful & dull to sit through . There are no scares , no sub plots to give us a break from Jeff & his Father , no atmosphere & a complete lack of anything that even remotely resembles entertainment . The script by Ted Chalmers & Tracy Charlton is terrible , the characters will get on your nerves , it's as slow & dull as any horror film I've seen & it doesn't make any sense at all . I mean how come no one else has ever discovered these parasite things ? How do these things cure mental illness ? They also chuck in a lame & predictable ' twist ' ending too . According to the IMDb Brain Fix had a minuscule budget of $10 , 000 & all I can say is where did the money go ? ! Brain Fix looks even cheaper than that . Forget about any gore either , there's a brief operation scene of one of the parasites being implanted but it's short & like everything else cheap looking . There is also a terrible looking slit throat & that's it , that's your lot ! I hate Brain Fix , it's one of those films that you simply can't express in words how bad it is , it commits the unforgivable crime of being boring which is worse than having rubbishy production values because if a film entertains than I can forgive almost anything . Easily one of the worst horror films ever made & with those missing sound effects was Brain Fix ever truly completed ? Avoid at all costs , you have been warned .
498351	1355507	863005	1.0	" The Vatican can go to hell ! " Rubbishy low budget The Exorcist rip-off that's thirty five years too late .	Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood . Her parents Ely ( Randy Colton ) & Blanche ( Leslie Fleming-Mitchell ) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter , recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's . Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel ( Del Zamora ) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it . Blanche calls priest Jacob ( Cameron Daddo ) who is her other daughter Claire's ( Madison Taylor ) ex husband to see Isabelle , he confirms Miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free . . . Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again , why do I do it . Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder ? Right lets honest about this , Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist ( 1973 ) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share . There's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things , the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's , the worried parents , the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's , the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things . I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different ( other than it's total crap ) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring . The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either , the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out . At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof , there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a ' little prick ' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back ! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect . The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama , or it did in my opinion at least . According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on ' Actual Events ' , yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist . . . This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest . There isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up , there's a scene of a cut arm , there's a dead dog , someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it . There's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive . I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen . One pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it . There is zero scares , no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went , the film looks ugly & cheap throughout . There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom . The acting is very poor from all involved , genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time . Even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent , he is better than this . Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway . A total turkey from start to finish .
497741	1355507	884237	1.0	Absolutely dreadful pseudo computer game masquerading as a horror film .	Carnivorous starts as Kate ( Leah Rose ) gets a flat tyre while driving in some isolated woods somewhere , soon after a guy ( Chris Flieller ) comes along in a truck & abducts her after knocking her out with a shovel . Kate wakes up to find herself tapped inside what looks like a huge labyrinth that is populated by awful computer game graphics , sorry I mean scary ten foot tall monsters . Along with various other people Kate has to survive the various traps , dodge the monsters & try to find a way out of the maze like labyrinth & to the safety of the real world . . . Written & directed by Drew Maxwell I watched Carnivorous last night , I actually had the choice of watching this , Southern Comfort ( 1981 ) , Kiss the Girls ( 1997 ) or Saw II ( 2005 ) & I definitely made the wrong decision since Carnivorous is one of the worst films it's been my displeasure to endure . At the time of writing this comment Carnivorous has a lowly User Rating of 1 . 8 on the IMDb & I am wondering why so high ? Also at the time of writing this comment there is only one other User Comment & it starts by asking the question ' Why such a low IMDb rating ? ' , well it has such a low rating because it's truly dreadful . It's abysmal . It's appalling in every aspect . It's an awful film , if you can describe it as a film , & it's as simple & straight forward as that really . I have no connection to the film industry , I had never heard of Carnivorous before I watched it , I don't know anyone involved with the film & the director & producer & actor's are just ' names ' to me & I didn't see it at some obscure film festival with an introduction by the director which is all it takes for some people to rave about the biggest pieces of celluloid crap imaginable . I am just an average guy & I cannot understand or see how anyone could find anything in Carnivorous even in the remotest bit enjoyable or entertaining . Both conceptually & technically Carnivorous is appalling . The story is weak , the character development is none existent , the plot makes no sense , there's barely any exposition , it's impossible to care about what is going on & it's unrelentingly dull & boring to boot . Definitely one to avoid . A lot of Carnivorous was shot in a warehouse against a green-screen & the backgrounds & monsters were digitally put in later & the process looks terrible . The perspective is all wrong , character's just don't look right or stand right against the poorly rendered & detailed backgrounds which look awful . It's so dark you can barely see anything , the lighting is all wrong on character's face's & bodies , the CGI monster look terrible & the average PS3 console game looks better with more convincing graphics . Carnivorous is like a poorly made video game but without the fun of the interaction , you just sit there looking at these awful CGI graphics & praying that it's going to finish sooner rather than later . The film has a really odd look & feel , your brain just know's that something is wrong , that something isn't quite right in the way character's walk around or the perspective of certain shots & it's a very odd viewing experience . There's not much gore either , there's a decapitated , an impaling & a cut head but nothing else & all the actor's obviously were working without any on set props & these scenes just don't work as the CGI animators try to match the live action & the CGI but pretty much fail on every occasion . I have never seen another film quite like Carnivorous & I genuinely hope it's a one off & filmmakers don't go down the cheap CGI route not only for backgrounds but sets & props as well . According to the IMDb this had a supposed budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 , yeah right ! Knock at least three zeros off that & I think that would be nearer the true budget . The film has no scares , the lighting is well off , the CGI backgrounds are far too dark & look terrible & the whole film seems to try & go far a Hellbound : Hellraiser II ( 1988 ) feel with it's Gothic style hellish labyrinth complete with dangling hooks on chains but the CGI is awful . The acting is terrible too from no-one I have ever heard of . Carnivorous is a truly terrible film , it's absolutely dreadful & deserves it's lowly IMDb rating . This is definitely ' worst film ever ' material & I would hate to think the techniques used here to make Carnivorous would become widespread in the industry . One of the worst films I have ever endured & I have endured some real rubbish over the years .
498968	1355507	91142	2.0	Absolutely terrible film which makes no sense whatever anyone says .	Gothic is set in Geneva at the Villa Deodati where English poet Lord Byron ( Gabriel Byrne ) lives in a self imposed exile . Percy Shelley ( Julian Sands ) his lover Mary Godwin ( Miranda Richardson ) & her sister Claire ( Myriam Cyr ) all turn up wanting to spend some quality time with Byron & have some fun , Byron invites everyone in & says they are welcome . Over the course of that very night lots of strange things happen which I'm at a loss to explain & the film itself doesn't do a very good job either . . . This British production was directed by Ken Russell & is a film which almost defies logical explanation or any reasonable critique of it , I don't know what Kenneth was on when he made this but it must have been strong stuff & it's no wonder he's been relegated to appearing on Celebrity Big Brother & making home films which no-ones ever seen . The script by Stephen Volk which takes itself extremely seriously is a strange beast to say the least although one has to bear in mind that what ended up on screen maybe isn't what he actually wrote as many things can happen between writing a script & the finished product , if this finished version was representative of his script though one has to wonder how this piece of crap ever got financed & who did he think this mess of a film was going to appeal to ? Certainly not your average horror film fan that's for sure . The basic plot about the the events which lead up to Mary writing Frankenstein & Byron's doctor John Polidori ( Timothy Spall ) to write The Vampire could have been decent but it's totally lost under loads of pretentious art-house visuals which are far from impressive . As a whole Gothic is bizarre , weird & just totally out there unfortunately it's also pointless , boring , crap , rubbish , meaningless , empty , unsatisfying & what really kills it is that it provides zero entertainment value , yes it really is that bad . It's not even historically accurate , did you know it was actually Byron who visited Shelley & not the other way round as Gothic would have you believe ? Well now you do . I pretty much hated this film from start to finish . Director Russell is in total over-the-top mode here with some strange imagery , unfortunately it's not very striking & it just all comes off a weird & pointless . The whole film is quite abstract & surreal , in fact it's maybe the Salvador Dali of horror films ! Just when you think it's settling down into some sort of proper story as Claire admits that she's pregnant with Byron's child or when they hold a séance around an old skull it goes nowhere & ends back up with some more strange scenes which makes no sense . Although the visuals are strange & weird I don't think they are particularly stylishly filmed or constructed which doesn't help . The film as a whole is quite tame , the nudity isn't excessive & there's no gore or violence to speak of . Technically the film is alright , the location used was Gaddesdon Place in Hamel Hampstead in Hertfordshire which is in good old England & the house in the film just feels very empty & basic although it's obviously of the right period & looks the business . It's generally well made with decent production values throughout . This has a good cast with Byrne , Richardson , Spall & Sands but they ham it up & put in pretty bad overwrought performances . Gothic is a film which I personally hated , I'm positive it has some fans out there but most film-goers will find it an absolute mess . In fact I'd struggle to even call it a proper film it's that bad , who in their right mind actually green lit this piece of crap & how did Kenneth manage to convince anyone to finance it ?
499184	1355507	416821	2.0	A sequel that's just as bad if not worse than the rubbishy original .	Horror 102 : Endgame is set in an old abandoned Insane Asylum where several high school / university students are staying as part of a school project field trip , however the care taker Owen ( Michael Moon ) tells of the asylum's dark past & that it is apparently haunted by the tormented spirits of it's previous abused inhabitants . Spooky eh ? Well none of that really matters as the brave young students are unfazed . Arranged by their mysterious lecturer ( whom none of them has ever met ) Mr . Jacobson he fails to show & the asylum goes into ' curfew mode ' where all the doors & windows are locked tight , trapped inside the run down asylum the students begin to realise that a killer walks amongst them as the bodies start to pile up . Who is the killer ? Why are they killing students ? Who even cares ? Not me . . . No this isn't the one hundred & first sequel to some obscure horror film it is in fact the first sequel to the less than impressive teen slasher with a ( terrible ) twist Horror 101 ( 2000 ) which I endured last week & thought was total crap so I really wasn't looking forward to Horror 102 : Endgame it's low budget straight-to-video / DVD sequel . Horror 101 was written & directed by James Dudelson who acts as producer here on this while he turns the writing & directing duties over to Ana Clavell who also edited the thing & whose only subsequent films are the absolutely dire Day of the Dead 2 : Contagium ( 2005 ) & Creepshow III ( 2006 ) which basically means he hasn't made a single even half way decent film . The original Horror 101 was rubbish so quite why someone felt a sequel needed to be made is a mystery & true to expectation Horror 102 : Endgame is maybe perhaps even worse than Horror 101 which is saying something . The two films have no real connection to each other , none of the original character's return & none of the events of the original are referred to either & apart from the obvious similarities with two sets of teenage character's being killed off by some killer there's nothing to connect the two films at all . Horror 102 : Endgame is your typical shot on a camcorder teen slasher set in a single isolated location that tries to spring a surprise with a Scream ( 1996 ) style twist ending although the twist makes no sense & I can't really figure out what the point of the plot is , there seems to be absolutely no reasoning behind anything that happens that makes any sort of logical sense . The script doesn't even try to give any plausible reason why these teens are staying at this asylum other than it's for some field trip the purpose of which is never revealed or explained . The character's are awful although at least there isn't a clichéd comic relief character , the killer's identity & motives suck & are just almost seemingly random & the pace is very slow as we are treated to almost endless sequences of these teens walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular . One to avoid . The original Horror 101 was very notable for just how bloodless & tame it was in a PG sort of way & while Horror 102 : Endgame is slightly better in this regard it's still PG stuff . At least there's actually some blood splatter in this although none of the death's happen on screen & as such there's no real pay-off or reward for sticking with it . There's nothing scary here , there's nothing memorable here & there's a very flat & bland atmosphere that just makes the whole thing a chore to sit through . The film has reasonable production values but little in the way of style , apparently this old asylum has electrical problems yet after years of being shut down the ' curfew mode ' still works perfectly & on time too . Shot in Los Angeles . The acting by no-one of any note is terrible & character's reactions & decision making are awful although the script doesn't help . Horror 102 : Endgame is the sequel to a rubbish film that no-one wanted & amazingly is maybe even worse than the original which I didn't think would be possible . Two absolute stinkers & if you decide to watch both as a double feature good luck to you since your going to need it .
498803	1355507	117002	2.0	A must for insomniacs .	Mary Reilly is set in Victorian London where Mary Reilly ( Julia Roberts ) is a housemaid to a Dr . Henry Jekyll ( John Malkovich ) , he treats her & the rest of the servants well so she is relatively satisfied with her life . However , the calmness of the household is broken when Jekyll starts to stay out all night , he then says he will be collaborating with an assistant named Mr . Edward Hyde ( John Malkovich ) on his experiments & he should be treated as they treat him . Reilly meets Mr . Hyde who turns out to be a bit of a bad lad , meanwhile she has secret affections for her master Dr . Jekyll & soon realises they are both one & the same person . . . Directed by Stephen Frears I will openly admit right here & now that Mary Reilly bored me stiff , I honestly wanted to switch it off & go to sleep but in the fairness of this comment I decided to endure the final 40 minutes . The script by Christopher Hampton was based on the novel of the same name by Valerie Martin which itself obviously took inspiration from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel The Strange Case of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde , who was it exactly that thought telling the story of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde from the perspective of his housemaid was a good idea ? No offence but it sounds lame just thinking about it & sure enough the finished film is total crap that I personally found ways to hate it on many levels . From the absolute tedium of it all to the snails pace , to the awful romance between the main character's & the slushy sentimental drama to the fact it's one of the most boring films I've seen . I didn't like anyone in it , I didn't like the way the makers have taken a decent horror themed story & turned it into some horrible tedious romance & the lack of any horror or scares just sinks it without trace as far as I'm concerned . By the way did I mention it was boring ? Director Frears does alright , to give the film credit where it deserves it the production design & look of it are fabulous . This would give any period Hammer Horror flick a good run for it's money , then again I suppose you can stage a film like this when you have nearly 50 million dollars as your budget . Apparently Tim Burton was set to direct this but decided to make Ed Wood ( 1994 ) instead , he might have actually injected some horror & mystery into the plot while still retaining the Gothic romance just like he did with his excellent Sleepy Hollow ( 1999 ) . There's no real horror or scares in Mary Reilly , it has a nice fog enshrouded look but little else . Animal lovers beware , there are shots of eels being killed & skinned , being the old romantic that he is Mr . Hyde takes Mary to a slaughter house & again there are various animal carcasses strung up being skinned & gutted along with various organs in buckets & strewn across the floor . A man is also killed with the end of his walking cane in the films most violent scene . I am amazed this had a budget of near $50 , 000 , 000 , it doesn't look like it although it's undeniably well staged & made . According to the IMDb Roberts got paid $10 , 000 , 000 for this , well she's terrible in it & her accent is awful . Shot on location in London , Scotland & in Pinewood studios . Generally speaking though there's a great cast here including Malkovich , George Cole , Kathy Staff , Michael Gombon & Glenn Close as the owner of a London whore house . At the 1997 Razzie Awards Mary Reilly was nominated for two , Julia Roberts as worst actress which she should have won & Stephen Frears as worst director which considering the film looks alright is maybe a bit harsh . Mary Reilly is in my opinion a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that , when I watch a film I want to be entertained & not bored out of my skull & that's just the way it is . Thank god I saw it on cable TV & didn't spend any of my hard earned money on it . Mary Reilly sucks & she should have stuck to being a lowly servant girl .
497317	1355507	466875	3.0	" Your not only telling me I was raped & murdered tonight but my Grandfather was eaten ? " Terrible .	Left in Darkness starts on the 21st birthday of parentless Celia ( Monica Keena ) who goes along to a frat party with her best friend Justine ( Jessica Stroup ) as way of celebration . However a scumbag guy named Doug ( Chris Engen ) & his mates spike Celia's drink & when she's suitably unconscious Doug rapes her . Celia wakes up only to see her own body in the corner of the room , obviously shocked she runs downstairs where she meets her dead Grandfather ( Tim Thomerson ) who tells her that she is dead & stuck in a place somewhere between heaven & hell & that a load of soul eating zombies are trying to , well , eat her soul . Can she survive death , even though she's already dead if you know what I mean & get to heaven where good little girls like he go ? Directed by Steven R . Monroe I personally hated Left in Darkness & it's as simple & straight forward as that . The script by Philip Daay & Jane Whitney tries to be different but ends up being a load of old tosh , it's slow , it's boring & it introduces so many obscure ' rules ' it's hard to keep track of things & even harder to care . Firstly there's the sanctuary bit , the bit about where the zombies are & aren't allowed , the touching the mirror , being able to affect certain objects & situations , some nonsense about a dead persons light that gives protection , a guardian angel dude who becomes the focus of the most obvious ' twist ' ending ever , Celia all of a sudden having to complete tasks , zombies not being able to touch her unless she touches them & more besides . Now don't get me wrong as I love something a bit different , something where you have to think & something totally original but I also hate bad films & ladies & gentlemen I suggest to you that Left in Darkness is a very bad film . All these silly elements are thrown together with one new rule being introduced every few minutes as the previous one is totally forgotten , I found it incredibly tedious to watch , I couldn't get into the story because of all the stupid shifts in the narrative , the film lacks any decent horror elements & as a whole I have no fondness for Left in Darkness at all . Director Monroe does OK although it's neither any better nor any worse than the dozens of low budget straight-to-video horror films that seem to be around at the moment . There's zero atmosphere , there's zero tension & zero gore . I couldn't get over he ridiculous sounding fact that zombies were trying to kill someone who was in principal already dead , the more I think about this film the more I want to lower my IMDb score for it . Technically the film is fine , it's reasonably well made with no obvious problems . Shame about the over-elaborate & confused script which tries to throw some new pointless ' rule ' in every few minutes . The acting wasn't that great either , leading lady Keena was easy on the eyes but I doubt she'll get much work because of Left in Darkness . Left in Darkness is crap , I'll give it because I will openly admit that it does at least try to do something a bit different , it's just a shame it all turned out so terrible . Definitely not recommend .
498202	1355507	264675	3.0	" At least they didn't blow up the toilets like last year . " Terrible low budget slasher .	Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader starts late one Halloween night , also the eve of a big football game , as local high-school caretakers George & Earl remove dead animals hanging from the sports field goalposts , put there as a practical joke by some people who obviously have no sense of humour . However George comes across a bag which contains the decapitated head of a cheerleader named Patricia Bertwood . It's not long before head cheerleader Heather Connelly ( Tasha Biering ) is told the distressing news over the phone by cheerleading coach Elaine Riley ( Debbie Rochon ) , they are somewhat shocked but figure the show must go on . Shortly after putting the phone down coach Riley is murdered . . . Back at home with Heather & the phone calls start , phone calls from the killer who taunts her , scares her & warns her not to set foot outside of her house . Meanwhile three more member's of the cheerleading squad , Molly ( Noelle Manuel ) , Violet ( Beth Hunt ) & Rose ( Amy R . Swaim ) meet gruesome ends at the hands of the axe wielding killer . Heather receives more phone calls informing her of her friends fate but who is responsible ? Her boyfriend Danny ( Daniel Justin Roach ) ? Her jealous & possessive ex Chris ( Andre Walker ) ? Or maybe the local drunk Joseph Hatterman ( Bob Carter ) who has a very dodgy history ? Written , produced & directed by Jeffrey Miller Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a pretty poor film on all accounts . The script obviously takes it's inspiration , or steals it's ideas whichever way you want to put it , from better films from this genre like Scream ( 1996 ) & Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) & unfortunately doesn't do a very good job , it can't even match them let alone surpass them in an already overcrowded sub genre . For most of it's 80 minute duration Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a very uninspired clichéd slasher , think the worst Friday the 13th clone you can & mix it with a right out of nowhere a similar to Scream twist ending which seemed over elaborate but at the same time was surprisingly effective . If the start of the film had built up to this ending better than Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader could have been a decent little film but it comes from absolutely nowhere & just doesn't feel like it belongs to the preceding 70 minutes which are throughly routine & not especially enjoyable . The character's are awful , the dialogue is poor with some really bad red-herrings spread throughout that just don't work although at least there is a fairly steady stream of victims & it's quite short . Director Miller hasn't got a clue how to make a horror film . There is no build up to any of the murders they just suddenly happen which means there is no tension or potential for scares whatsoever . He has no idea how to set a mood as in one scene as Heather is having a ' emotional ' chat with her ex boyfriend Chris his choice of music is bizarre as he uses a tune that would be more appropriate during a murder scene . There are a few murder's but nothing that memorable , a couple of women have their breasts cut off with an axe , someone gets an axe in the head , there is quite possibly the worst looking severed foot I've ever seen , a couple of decapitated heads & a hammer stuck in someone's head . There is some nudity as well which is nice but no actual sex scenes . The budget for Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader must have been minuscule , I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say that 90 % of the film takes place in Heather's front room & house ( that ' don't go out ' warning from the killer was there to save money then ) & it becomes highly irritating . The shot on video photography is point shoot & hope for the best stuff while the special effects are anything but special . The acting is pretty poor , but then did I really expect anything else ? Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a throughly rotten attempt at a slasher film , apart from from a clever & surprisingly effective climax which deserves to be used in a better overall film there is absolutely nothing to recommend here . Stick with the likes of Friday the 13th , The Burning ( 1981 ) , My Bloody Valentine ( 1981 ) & Scream for decent slashers that deliver the goods . Not worth your time or money .
497640	1355507	69994	3.0	Good idea , average execution .	Dr Stephens ( Micheal Harvey ) runs a mental asylum . He has a different approach to the insane . He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment . He treats everyone like family , there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies . He lets Sergeant Jaffee ( Hugh Feagin ) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet ( Camilla Carr ) be a mother to a doll , including letting her put it to bed in a cot . Dr . Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W . Cameron ( Gene Ross ) chop a log up with an axe , it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr . Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder . Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale ( Rosie Holotik ) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr . Stevens about a possible job . She is met by the head Nurse , Geraldine Masters ( Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams ) and is offered a trail position . She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients . However things eventually start to turn sour , the phone lines are cut , an old lady named Mrs . Callingham ( Rhea MacAdams ) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow . Then , one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed . Produced and directed by S . f . Brownrigg this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending , but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope . There are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates , not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes . The film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the Sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere . There's no graphic gore in it , a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot . There's a bit of nudity , but like the gore not much . The acting is pretty strong , especially Holotik and Weenick . The photography is flat and unexciting and I can't even remember what the music was like . The twist ending is great , but it just takes far too long to get to it . A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget . OK I guess , but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour ' Tales form the Crypt ' episode .
498587	1355507	925306	3.0	More ' Creature Feature ' nonsense .	Tyrannosaurus Azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes ( Ian Ziering ) has landed in Mexico with six of his best men including Lieutenant Rios ( Marco Sanchez ) , they intend to claim the land in the name of the Spanish & maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises . Within minutes they have their first sight of local Aztec savages , within minutes after that Cortes & his men are captured & held prisoner . If that wasn't bad enough it turns out that a couple of Tyrannosaurus Rex live there & like to eat the locals , in an effort to win their lives the Spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas & ulterior motives it's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for . . . Directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith ( who , coincidently , made one of my all time favourite exploitations films Turkey Shoot ( 1982 ) which I throughly recommend to one & all ) & also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of Aztec Rex ( the title was changed by the Sci-Fi Channel when they aired it maybe as the original title Tyrannosaurus Azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film ) this is yet another idiotic & cheap looking Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' & that's all you need to know really . Based on & around the real Spanish Conquistador Cortes during his expedition to Mexico the film definitely doesn't strive for historic accuracy although I will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately Tyrannosaurus Azteca is still just a ' Creature Feature ' with a bunch of people running from some poor CGI computer graphic of a monster despite it's period setting . Not too sure what else I can say , despite being set centuries ago the usual clichés are here , the character's are the usual cardboard cutouts , make stupid decisions & the selfish one , the heroic one , the backstabbing one , the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten & the pretty woman are all here & easy to spot . The film is predictable , silly , dull & doesn't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace & there's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you . The story isn't that good & has plenty of holes too , this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days . Now I have seen & commented on plenty of Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Features ' & usually the CGI computer effects are terrible & while Tyrannosaurus Azteca doesn't exactly buck the trend I will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards . There's a few decent gore effects here too , there's a cut out heart , a guy's leg is bitten off , there's some blood splatter , a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur , there's a few dead bodies seen & someone is stabbed with a spear . The T-Rex gets to eat a couple of people too . The production values are really cheap , the Aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from Styrofoam & those Spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist , they could have simply stepped out of it & run away it was so low . With a supposed budget of about $900 , 000 I can't see where the money went , shot in O'ahu in Hawaii in apparently fifteen days . The acting isn't great from no-one I have ever heard of . Tyrannosaurus Azteca really isn't any better than any other cheap Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' despite an almost interesting & unusual premise , that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not ( at a guess probably not ) .
498321	1355507	78398	3.0	" You will be a vegetable when I've finished with you . " - They're not wrong either !	Tigress , or Ilsa , Tigress of Siberia as I'm positive it's more commonly know as , starts in ' Serbia 1953 ' where Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne ) runs a prison camp for Russian dictator Josef Stalin who sends various enemies of the state there for readjustment , if that's the right word . Ilsa runs Gulag 14 with an iron fist , anyone who tries to escape is killed , anyone who refuses to work is killed & anyone who steps out of line is killed . One fateful day the news reaches Ilsa that Stalin has been overthrown , Ilsa orders the destruction of the camp & the execution of all the prisoners but one inmate , political dissident Andre , manages to escape with his life along with Ilsa & a couple of her sadistic guards . Jump to ' Montreal 1977 ' & Andre is in town to accompany a Russian hockey team for some sort of Olympic tournament when a couple of the team want to go to a brothel & have sex with a couple of prostitutes . However this particular brothel is run by Ilsa who spots Andre & thinks his appearance is far from a coincidence , Ilsa has Andre kidnapped for reasons that aren't overly clear or logical but both parties have vengeance on their minds . . . This Canadian production was directed by Jean LaFleur & Tigress was the fourth Ilsa film in a series that began with Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS ( 1975 ) . To be honest I think all of the Ilsa films are pretty rotten & Tigress isn't any different . The script by Marven McGara starts off impressively with Ilsa the Commander of an isolated prison camp , this is probably the best 40 odd minutes that the entire series has to offer as it has a nice exploitative feel with plenty of torture , executions , sex & some unintentionally funny dialogue . Unfortunately for the remainder of Tigress it shifts to Canada & a really boring soft core sex / gangster type film that is absolutely excruciating to sit through . The first & second halves of Tigress are as different as can be , it's almost as if two separate films had been spliced together ( badly ) & the only common threads are Andre & Ilsa . The first half of the film moves along at a nice pace & actually pretty good while the second half is as dull as dishwater & complete total & utter crap . I really don't know who this film would appeal to or who it would please , overall it's a pretty rubbish film taken as a whole . Director LaFleur does a good job for the first half as he keeps things moving along but the second half ruins everything . Don't expect much style or visual flair but it has a nice sleazy atmosphere at times during the first half . I personally think Tigress is the most gory of the Ilsa films , the fights & shootouts feature lots of blood , there are impalings , stabbings , someone has their head smashed to pieces with a hammer , someone gets chopped up in one of those snow clearing machines , people are fed to Tigers & a really graphic scene of a guy having his hand chainsawed off while playing the ultimate game of arm wrestling . There is a fair amount of nudity & some really unsexy sex scenes which are about as much of a turn on as a slap in the face with a wet fish . Technically Tigress is alright , it's competently made throughout although some it is rather bland . The music used is the same as various cues from Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . The acting is poor especially Thorne as Ilsa whom I think is ugly , old , a terrible actress & her large saggy breasts leave me cold & her shower scene had me reaching for the stop button but since I'm such a masochist I stuck with it . Tigress is a poor exploitation film , the first half is as good as the Ilsa series gets but the second half is probably as worse as it gets which takes some doing , it's as simple & straight forward as that . Definitely not recommended as there are far better exploitation films out there .
498116	1355507	339135	3.0	" Your more useful to me as a btch . " Terrible Van Damme flick .	In Hell is set in Russia where American contractor Kyle ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) arrives home one night to discover his wife Grey ( Marnie Alton ) dead & some Russian scumbag with a knife , Kyle gives chase but loses him . When the police finally catch up with the guy he pays the judge off & walks away scott free , Kyle takes exception to this & using a cop's handgun dishes out his own justice . Before Kyle can say ' I did it for my wife ' he's been sentenced to life in a prison called Kravovia , it's a hell hole where they give you slop to eat , where the guards regularly beat you , your fellow inmates are big hairy ugly Russian mother fers & it's the sort of establishment where you definitely don't bend over in the shower . Kyle quickly discovers that the guards put on fights between two inmates to amuse the sadistic warden so he pours a frying pan of chip fat over his hair , grows a stupid gay looking goatee beard & decides to join in . . . Directed by Ringo Lam I am genuinely surprised at how many positive comments In Hell has on the IMDb , although while I'm surprised I don't really care as I thought it was crap . The script by Eric Jmaes Virgets , Jorge Alvarez , Steve Latshaw & Les Weldon tries to be some serious prison drama as in Midnight Express ( 1978 ) & The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) but falls totally flat on it's face , by the time the ghost of JCVD's dead wife show's up all credibility had gone out of the window & the scenes where he takes inspiration from a flying magical moth are hilariously bad & out of place . Then there's the action , or rather the disappointing lack of it . JCVD doesn't get into a fight until over an hour into the thing & even then it's uninspiring stuff before he suddenly sees the error of his ways & that fighting is ' wrong ' before he gives an embarrassing emotional speech to the rest of his fellow inmates at the end which is accompanied by violins on the soundtrack ! I also thought In Hell had an unhealthy preoccupation with gay sex & was very homophobic , I mean there's plenty of butt raping action going on as inmates rape one another just about every night & there's even a flashback sequence which show's why JCVD's cell mate is in prison which revolves around him setting someone on fire who was going to butt rape him . I mean every gay bloke in In Hell is portrayed as some big , brutish , rapist freak of nature ! Director Lam is sandbagging it here , the entire first hour is nothing more than constant tedious scenes of JCVD having a hard time , getting picked on by the guards & inmates , given slop to eat , left in solitary confinement & just about every other prison film cliché that establishes that it's not a very nice place to be . JCVD starts off OK in this but then he grows his hair long & a beard as he resembles a homeless wino before he slicks it all back & has this awful looking little goatee beard on his chin . The action scenes are poor , there's no slow motion roundhouse kicks here , it's pretty dull pub brawl type fights . The violence is also tame & there's never any reason given for why that guy kills JCVD's wife at the start . With a supposed budget of about $17 , 000 , 000 this had a fair amount of money spent on it & I have to say apart from the sets & locations I can't really see where the money went . It was shot in Bulgaria & it's well made for what it is but there are loads of well made films out there that actually have a decent story too . The acting isn't great & I can't believe anyone actually says JCVD is good in this . In Hell is a film that tries to be something it's not , it tries to be a prison drama but the character's & situations are so bad it all ends up coming across like a comedy as the action scenes feel like an afterthought . Personally I thought it was pants .
498652	1355507	377707	3.0	' Jaws of Steel ! ' The best giant killer crocodile film to come out of Thailand , ever .	Excellent , I've always wanted to be the first to review a film on the IMDb ! A fierce hurricane devastates an island somewhere just off the coast of Thailand . It destroys model houses and trees as if they weren't there . Thunder , lightening , lashing winds and torrential rainfall cause tidal waves and mudslides that wipe's an entire village community out . During this footage we get several shots of a group of crocodiles caught up in the hurricane . After witnessing this destruction we head into the opening credits . They alternate between shots of two topless women being eaten by a giant crocodile , two on screen credits for the producers and director ( this film has no other credits besides these even at the end ) , and a still of what looks like a watercolour painting where all the colour's have run and mixed into each other , bizarre . We are introduced to a Dr . Anthony Akom ( Nat Puvanni ) , Tony to his mates , his wife Angela plus their two daughters Linda and Ann , plus Linda's fiancé Dr . John Strom who are all having dinner together . Linda comments on a newspaper headline and asks whether the rumour's are true that the hurricane was caused by an atomic explosion . They all decide to take a short holiday and before we know it they've travelled to a luxury beach-side hotel . While swimming in the sea Dr . Akom's daughters Ann and Linda , plus his wife Angela are all eaten by a giant crocodile . To have one member of your family eaten by a giant crocodile would be considered unfortunate but have have all three would probably hurt on an emotional level . Dr . Akom resigns his position and together with John he sets out to destroy the giant crocodile . First Akom talks to an expert on reptiles a Professor Lowes who somewhat jumps to conclusions and suggests that it could be possible for a crocodile to survive in the sea and says that atomic radiation might have created a giant mutant . The crocodile attacks and destroys a few riverside villages and eats a few people . Akom enlists the help of a local fisherman named Tanaka ( Kirk Warren ) who says they can use his boat , and talks about legends where sea monsters rise from the sea and thus he feels it's his duty to help . Meanwhile the Thai police decide to try and kill the crocodile themselves , by setting an over-sized bear-trap at the bottom of a river and baiting it with a joint of meat ! I'm not joking either . In another poorly edited sequence the plan fails miserably . The police admit defeat , and it's up to our hero's Akom and John to save the day ! Akom has worked out that the crocodile is heading to the open sea , hang on a minute wasn't it in the sea when it ate his family ? They lie in wait where the river joins the sea for the giant crocodile ready to fight it to the death ! Oh , and a reporter named Peter goes along as well , for some reason . Directed by Sampote Sands this is one pretty bad film . It tries , but rarely succeeds . Just think Jaws ( 1975 ) set in Thailand with a giant crocodile and a lot less money , in fact the ending is practically the same as Jaws and I'm surprised Spielberg hasn't sued ! The special effects are poor , miniature sets and a real crocodile look fake as does the full size crocodile and the various stiff looking puppet shots . When the crocodile is seen at night it has light's in it's eye's which almost look like headlights on a car ! There's a bit of blood here and there and a cool shot where a man with no legs after the crocodile had bitten them off and eaten them tries to swim away . There is also a totally unnecessary scene where a real crocodile is stabbed in the head and killed for no apparent reason , in graphic close-up . The film is obviously dubbed , badly too . And it wouldn't surprise me if the music has been redone for this English version as it seems so out of place and doesn't react to the on screen action at all , and the main theme appears to be the same piano note being played over and over and it becomes highly irritating . The editing on this film is terrible , we get random shots of things just appearing out of nowhere and in context having absolutely no relevance to anything else that is happening on screen at that particular time , like the crocodile being killed for instance . Quite often the entire frame is devoid of any action , almost as if the camera wasn't pointed in the right direction , during one scene which last for about a minute , which is why it stands out , we get a shot of a hut and someones hand poking out of the corner of the screen and I have no idea what he was meant to be doing because during the whole shot we just see one of his hands and nothing else ! Bizarre . The film moves along at a fair pace and is sort of entertaining on a ' bad ' level . Towards the end the sloppiness starts to wear thin and it becomes a bit of an endurance test , to sum up I'll end by saying this is the best giant killer crocodile film from Thailand , but then again please bear in mind that it's the only one . Impossible to recommend to anyone , but I just about managed to watch it all the way through .

Bloodrage starts with a small town prostitute named Beverly ( Judith-Marie Bergan ) seeing a regular named Charlie ( Jerry McGee ) out the door as her boyfriend arrives , a local cop named John Ryan ( James Johnson ) who knows about her chosen career but turns a blind eye . Once he leaves Beverly is visited by a young , shy & sexually repressed man named Richard ( Ian Scott ) who , in certain scenes , is a dead ringer for Christopher Walken . Anyway , Beverly invites him in & says that she has noticed him watching her & that he has to pay her for her time whether he stays or not . Richard doesn't like her demanding money from him & when she threatens to call her boyfriend Ryan , Richard becomes violent & aggressive .

Richard has to think & act quickly , he cleans the blood up ( gee , large amounts of blood sure does come off white walls without leaving a single trace easily & quickly doesn't it ? ) & hides Beverly's body in a closet just as Ryan enters the house . Even though he thinks it seems a little strange that Beverly has all but disappeared eventually Ryan leaves & then Richard disposes of Beverly's body out back , Richard then hitch hikes & gets into a truck which takes him to Times Square , New York City .

However , because of the pressures of living in New York Richard soon feels the urge to kill again & singles out yet another prostitute , this time named Lucy ( Blair Trigg ) . By some bizarre coincidence Ryan feels that Beverly might have gone to New York & sets off to find her , he contacts detective Tom Malone ( Lawrence Tierney ) & asks around at various strip bars . By an even more amazing chain of coincidences Ryan becomes aware of Richard & sets out to stop him & gain some revenge . . . Produced & directed by Joseph Zito I thought Bloodrage was a little bit too dull & slow for my liking . The script by Robert Jahn is poorly paced as it starts out very well with the brutal murder of Beverly but then goes into a real lull for an absolute age from which it never really recovers . The character of Richard is a problem , he never interacts with anyone at any point in the film as a normal person except his neighbour Candice & even then it's hardly a normal relationship . We know virtually nothing about him when Bloodrage starts & more or less the same when it finishes , Richard is given a few monologues to try & give him some personality , background & motivation but they aren't overly effective or insightful . The script tries to paint Richard as a normal everyday person living a dull 9 to 5 life in isolation , that's fine I suppose but it's not what I personally want to see in a film as most of us live that life anyway . Occasionally Richard decides to take out his pent up frustrations out on women & he justifies his actions by the fact they are prostitutes & strippers . The coincidences which lead Ryan to both New York & Richard are rather far fetched , Bloodrage ends very abruptly as well . This is a film which concentrates on set up so don't expect a high body count , in fact Richard only kills three people during the film , & one dog . There's not much blood or gore , the slit throat by broken glass is quite nasty but the other two are strangulations & contain no blood even though they are surprisingly brutal & cold . Technically Bloodrage is generally fine throughout even if it isn't going to win any awards , the acting was surprisingly strong & the seedy late 70's New York Times Square locations really add to the unsettling atmosphere , it's just a shame the film plods along at such a slow pace . Even at a relatively short 77 minutes I won't be watching Bloodrage again anytime soon that's for sure , having said that I didn't think it was a complete waste of time just a somewhat misguided attempt at a serious portrait of the beginnings of a serial killer . Unfortunately I can't recommend Bloodrage to anyone as it's just too slow , dull & ultimately provides little in the way of entertainment value but it isn't without one or two merits .
497080	1355507	681741	3.0	The first of the moralistic episodes .	Quincy M . E . : A Good Smack in the Mouth starts late one Californian night as Melissa Asten ( Barbara Babcock ) stops to pick up a young nine year old boy named Joseph Harrison ( Shane Sinutko ) who is standing on the side of a freeway hitching a ride , a short time later Melissa is involved in an accident & her car ends up in a ditch on the side of the road . Since Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) is out of town his friend Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is informed that Mrs . Asten is in hospital , he visits her & also visits the boy Joey & after looking at his x-rays is shocked to see lots of injuries , the only explanation is child abuse & he is determined to protect Joey from his abusive parents . . . Episode 8 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Jackie Cooper & has the ( unwanted in my opinion ) distinction of being the first almost entirely social or moralistic issue based episode of Quincy & I pretty much hated every heavy handed preaching second of it . The main theme that A Good Smack in the Mouth tackles is the sensitive issue of child abuse which is fine but I don't really want to be watching such things , I want to be entertained & I much prefer the murder mystery episodes which involve laboratory work & Quincy playing detective . Here there is no laboratory work at all , A Good Smack in the Mouth is also one of the very few Quincy episodes not to feature a single autopsy or even so much as a dead body . I also thought the story was poor & badly written , it is claimed that the victim of abuse will show much , much more love towards the abuser . Eh ? How does that work ? I simply cannot believe a nine year old child will show more love towards someone who is beating them , I would buy that the boy wouldn't want to make him angry but to show that much affection is just hard to believe . Even sub consciously through the likes of body language & tone of voice would have given the boy away . Then there's the idea that one parent would just stand by & let the other beat their child , I would buy that if both parents were beating the child or if one of the parents simply didn't care but in A Good Smack in the Mouth the mother clearly states she does care & I just can't believe one caring parent would let their partner beat their child for years & not do a thing about it . There's an amusing scene in A Smack in the Mouth when Quincy visits a bored half naked housewife named Mona who gives Quincy the come on until her big burly bearded husband comes home , it's a funny little scene & probably the best in the programme . The acting is pretty good here with Klugman shining as the caring coroner , he gets to show a bit of fatherly love as well towards the boy . A Good Smack in the Mouth is maybe the very first totally moralistic based Quincy episode & it's not a good one . I really didn't like it at all & thought the story was just unbelievable & didn't convince me at all .
498734	1355507	681823	3.0	Predictable soap opera .	Quincy M . E . : Quincy's Wedding : Part II ( it says ' Part II ' on screen & not ' Part 2 ' not that it matters much ) starts as Quincy's ( Jack Klugman ) & his fiancé Emily's ( Anita Gillette ) relationship lays in tatters after the wedding is called off . Meanwhile Edna ( Jeanette Nolan ) goes back to the rest home in order to flush out her husband's killer at her own risk . . . Episode 18 from season 8 this two part story was written & directed by Jeri Taylor & predictably revolves around Quincy getting married to Emily . To be honest I don't like the way Quincy has gone during season eight in particular & Quincy's Wedding feels more like some horrible soap opera with a highly predictable murder mystery sub plot that is so contrived & downright silly it's hard to keep a straight face when the killer is revealed . So Quincy finally gets married but why wasn't Brill or Eddie or Diane or even Pete the guard invited to the wedding ? They have been with Quincy since the series started seven & a half seasons ago so why were they left out ? I'm not being funny but I'd have been pretty upset at not being invited & I thought Quincy was better than that . During the wedding Quincy is only ever referred to by simply Quincy & his first name is never revealed . Quincy also says his vows to Emily which are quite poetic & sweet but then the scene is absolutely ruined by Emily who then bursts out in song & sings her vows , it's a truly teeth clenching moment of embarrassment that I don't want to even think about anymore . Speaking of Emily the actress who plays her Anita Gillette is awful , just look at the scene at the start of this episode when she overacts horribly on the phone to her mum when she's supposedly upset & crying . Quincy's Wedding : Part II is another terrible soap opera style Quincy episode where the makers are trying to change so many of the things which made me like the series so much until now that I just can't like it & as such I didn't like it .
498612	1355507	745522	4.0	Forgettable episode .	Werewolf : Blood on the Tracks starts as drifter Eric Cord ( John J . York ) follows a train track into a small town where he finds a job working on the railroad . While there Eric meets his boyhood hero ex-professional heavyweight boxer ' Sweet ' Jake Williams ( Everett McGill ) who is in hiding with his wife Louise & young daughter Linda ( T . J . Wornalla ) from the mob who wants him dead after he refused to throw a fight . Eric gets into a barroom fight with a guy named Dil ( Tyler Tyhurst ) & Jake comes to Eric's rescue , however Dil goes to the local police & the fight attracts the wrong sort of attention as the mob soon turns up & starts looking for Jake . Together Eric & Jake decide to stay & fight . . . Episode fifteen from the first & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during November 1987 , directed by Rob Bowman ( who went on to direct The X-Files ( 1998 ) film & over thirty episodes from The X-Files ( 1994 - 2000 ) telly series ) this is probably one of my least favourite episodes from the series so far , there really is very little to recommend here as far as I am concerned . The whole boxer on the run from the mob after refusing to fix a fight plot is a well used one & was maybe most famously used in Daredevil ( 2003 ) as the reason why Matt Murdock decides to become a superhero . It's not a very captivating or particularly interesting storyline & what's worse is that it has no supernatural overtones at all apart from the rather predictable ending where Eric turns into a Werewolf & sorts Jake's problem out for him . Also this type of episode is starting to become a bit routine , the sort of episode where Eric meets some stranger on his travels who then pours their heart out to him & in some way or another Eric uses his Werewolf abilities to solve said strangers problems . The main problem with Blood on the Tracks is that basic central story revolving around a boxer is utterly forgettable , dull & not really suited to a horror themed series such as Werewolf . Neither regular character's Skorzeny or bounty hunter Rogan appear in Blood on the Tracks & as such this is one of those stand alone episodes which doesn't really move the overall story of the series as a whole along . There's not really much Werewolf action here , the Werewolf appears without any transformation scene & claws a guy's throat in one of the bloodier scenes from the show & then kills another off screen which amounts to about two minutes . The rest of this episode is spent on rather dull exposition that you will probably have forgotten by the time the end credits have finished . Lead guest star Everett McGill went on to star in the Twin Peaks ( 1990 - 1991 ) TV series . Blood on the Tracks is one of the most forgettable , routine & uninspiring Werewolf episodes . I didn't really like this one at all I'm afraid , definitely one you could skip & not really miss anything important or stimulating .
497048	1355507	171497	4.0	" This guy was ugly before he became a Werewolf . " Cheap horror film .	Lycanthrope starts in a top secret Government laboratory somewhere underground in the middle of the Amazon , a lab where a team of scientists were conducting experiments into the depletion of the o-zone layer & the effects that the suns ultra violet rays have on animal & plant life . Unfortunately something has gone very wrong so the top brass in the American Government send in special forces man Bill Parker ( producer Robert Carradine ) & his sidekick Lee Davis ( Michael Winslow ) to escort Dr . Ivan Stein ( Jeffery Alann Chase ) & his wife Sheila ( Rebecca Holden ) to the lab , assess the situation & ' clean up ' any mess there might be , have you lost the will to live yet ? I had by this point . Some army bird named Rosary ( Dalia Garcia ) & military dude Cody ( Bruce Gregory ) also go along . Once there they discover the various mutilated corpses of the scientific team & some fat black guy wearing an American football shirt who thinks he's a Werewolf because he's been exposed to the suns ultra violet rays . . . Written & directed by Bob Cook who also has a small role in the film as a dead body Lycanthrope is a pretty bad film all round . First it's very clichéd & predictable , for instance the scientists in the team want to study the Werewolf guy while the army dudes just want to kill it . At least a couple of the character's are there merely to pad the film out & become victims , I would also imagine that the pseudo psycho analytic explanation for the Werewolf seemed like a good idea at the time but unfortunately it doesn't translate very well to the screen & it just comes off as completely ridiculous . I suppose the filmmakers wanted to mix the Eco-disaster film with plenty of preaching together with low budget horror , as far as I'm concerned it doesn't work . Having said that the films stuffed with loads of unintentionally hilarious & stupid dialogue , it moves along at a reasonable pace , it's fairly short & it's good for a few laughs . Director Cook was obviously working on a really low budget , the special effects are rubbish including a simple shot of the sun in the sky ! Apparently set in the Amazon it is painfully obvious that it was shot in some local woods , every time the Amazon was mentioned I laughed ! There isn't really a traditional Werewolf in Lycanthrope , only a fat guy who thinks he's one so forget about seeing one . There isn't much gore , only a few after-the-fact dead bodies & a severed hand . Technically Lycanthrope is rough & that's being kind , it's poorly made with very low production values . Now on to the single most interesting aspect of Lycanthrope , have you ever wondered what happened to various stars from the 80's & 90's ? You know who I mean , people like Bill Murray , Steve Guttenberg & Rick Moranis . Well have you ever wondered what happened to the black guy from the Police Academy films who used to make all the funny noises ? Wonder no more as I can reveal he is starring in crap like this ! Yes , in case you want to know he does make lots of funny noises in this as well , talk about type casting ! Unfortunately the budget was so low on Lycanthrope that they couldn't afford him the entire shoot so he was killed off with the first 40 odd minutes . Yep , Lycanthrope really is that low budget ! I bet he & Steve Guttenberg could share some great ' crap films I've been in ' stories during the Police Academy cast union party ! Lycanthrope is a pretty crap film , it's badly made , it's stupid & there aren't any proper Werewolves in it . It's good for a few unintentional laughs & ' that guy from Police Academy ' but otherwise there is very little here to recommend .
497126	1355507	431418	4.0	" It's like someone came in here & tore through these guys like tissue paper . " Below average creature feature .	Stinger starts ' 3 Months Ago ' on the submarine the SS Newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions . . . Jump to ' Camp Pendleton ' a couple of months later where General Ashford ( James Cagnard ) brief's Lieutenant Williams ( John Miranda ) on his mission to board the Newark & assist genetic scientist Dr . Carly Ryan ( Michelle Meadows ) , before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the Newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from Dr . Mike Thompson ( Casey Clark ) who doesn't make much sense . It's not long before the scorpions attack , first to fall is Lt . Williams so Sergeant Sam Harmon ( Christopher Persson ) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever . . . This Sweedish America co-production was directed by Martin Munthe & he also handled the cinematography & I thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature . It's early into the new year & Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster / creature / insect type film I've seen in 2007 , hopefully things can only get better . . . The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clichéd & gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably Aliens ( 1986 ) , lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine , there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film , there's the scientists including a blonde Sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster / alien / insect or whatever , in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers . Yeah , it's all here , unfortunately Stinger isn't an Aliens if you get what I mean . It's a touch long at over 100 minutes & it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the IMDb . . . Director Munthe doesn't distinguish himself , it's not scary , there's a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting . There's not many scorpion attacks & it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs , the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but I have seen worse that's for sure . I mean that's not to say the effects in Stinger are good but I've seen worse . There isn't much blood or gore , there's some mutilated bodies , some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half . The only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked Sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions . . . However there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply / computer boards with a hammer & it works as well . . . Technically Stinger is average at best & there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous . Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if your interested . The acting was poor & there's nothing else to say . Stinger isn't a great film & it isn't a great horror film either , I can't recommend it at all but I've seen worse . If you liked Stinger ( unlikely ) you might like the similarly themed ' giant scorpions on the loose ' films Tail Sting ( 2001 ) or Scorpius Gigantus ( 2006 ) ( just as unlikely ) .
498563	1355507	83793	4.0	" It's too terrifying to even try & visualise it . " Another average one-time-watch horror / thriller / mystery at best .	Dark Sanity starts with a seemingly happy married couple named Alan ( Chuck Jamison ) & Karen Nichols ( Kory Clark , the IMDb listing is wrong her name is definitely spelt with a ' K ' in the credits ) moving into a new house in Los Angeles area having relocated from San Diego . Karen is an ex-alcoholic & has in the past suffered from ' visions ' , things begin badly as no soon has Karen set foot in the house she has a horrifying psychic vision of a severed head . . . Alan tries to comfort her & they both try to forget the incident & get on with moving in . Alan is a salesman & invites his boss & his wife Mr & Mrs ( Clarine Jackman ) Jacobs round for dinner , an idea with which Mr Jacobs agrees to . At first the casual dinner party goes well but while going upstairs Karen suffers from another vision , this time a cloaked figure appears to attack her with an axe . The Jacobs quickly make their excuses & leave as Karen shouts , screams & acts like a real loon . Karen's visions continue & she thinks about starting to drink again when an ex-police Sergeant named Larry Craig ( Aldo Ray ) talks about the house's dark past . Craig says that a woman named Lucy Duncan ( Iris Bath ) was decapitated in the house about a year ago & he thinks that the wrong man was put away , Lucy's son Edward ( Dennis Barnett ) . Craig also says that he had strange visions in the house as well & that he was a personal friend of Lucy's . Craig believes that the murderer is still at large & Karen's visions can help him unlock the mystery , find the real killer & bring them to justice . But who can it be ? Surely it's not Benny the retarded gardener as that would be far too obvious , but who else is there . . . ? Directed Martin Green Dark Sanity is a strictly by-the-numbers murder mystery with a few horror elements thrown in for good measure . The script by Larry Hilbrand & Phillip Pine isn't exactly gripping edge-of-the-seat stuff as it plods along at a fairly pedestrian pace . The murder elements aren't introduced until the 30 odd minute mark when Craig eventually shows up , what proceeds that is Karen having a couple of very brief visions . Frankly I'm surprised at the IMDb on this occasion , they insist on no spoilers without warning readers yet the ' Plot Outline ' section on Dark Sanity's main page gives away the twist ending revealing Karen's visions weren't flashbacks to the past but in fact flashfarwards to the future , her future . The person who wrote that is fired ! Empty your desk now ! Anyway , it works OK as an overall storyline but seemed a little lightweight & the eventually unmasking of the killer was somewhat underwhelming & the motive was about as simplistic & dull as it could have been & it's a shame that such little effort appeared to go into this potentially make-or-break aspect of the script . Dark Sanity felt more like a Saturday afternoon crime mystery episode like Columbo ( 1971 - 2003 , wow has it really been that long ? ! ) or Quincy ( 1976 - 1983 ) just without the intelligence or personality . The psychic investigator portion of the script is also severely underdeveloped & this could have been a great plot thread but instead it's reduced to the cheapness of having Karen scared by her visions & being able to have a severed head turn up once in a while , the marital dramatics between Alan & Karen also seem unnecessary & are frankly tedious to sit through . One more thing , what has that black cat that keeps turning up got to do with anything ? There's not a lot of gore , just a couple of OK looking severed heads , one cat & one human & a severed hand . The acting is OK & varies throughout the film . Technically Dark Sanity looks rather cheap through it's relatively short 85 odd minute running time , it ain't going to win any awards that's for sure . The music sounds like it was composed for a completely different film & doesn't compliment the on screen action at all . Overall I thought Dark Sanity was an OK time waster , I don't think I will ever want to see it again but as a one-time-watch it was satisfactory . Average at best & a good episode of Columbo would probably be a better alternative , difficult to recommend .
497620	1355507	303773	4.0	" They looked like flying Piranha for Christ's sake . " Dull as dishwater killer bugs film .	Deadly Swarm starts in ' Central Guatamala ' where evil misguided scientist Dr . Schroeder ( J . Patrick McCormack ) has found a new species of Wasp , a deadly species of Wasp known as ' Black Fire ' that he hopes will help him create a cure for various diseases , don't ask . Dr . Schroeder pays a local drug runner to take the deadly Wasp's over the border & back into the U . S . but en route the truck crashes & the deadly Wasp's are released ! At a nearby Mexican town American entomologist Daniel Lang ( Shane Brolly ) is conducting research on Mosquito's when his friend Commandante Alvarez ( Pepe Serna ) ask's him to take a look at the crash site because the first Officer on the scene is now dead covered in stings & since Daniel is an expert on insects , well you get the idea . At first Daniel isn't sure but finds a large hive made from bone fragments in a box in the back of the truck which he takes away for analysis . Meanwhile nosey novelist Sandra Kern ( Kaarina Aufranc ) senses a story & sticks close to Daniel as he discovers that these deadly Wasp's lay eggs in their victims which eventually hatch sending 1000's more Wasp's on their way to repeat the process , they must be stopped as does the dangerous experiments of Schroeder . . . This American Mexican co-production was directed by Paul Andresen & is a bit of a snooze-fest . The script takes itself extremely seriously & is rather mundane & predictable not to mention the fact that it's a little on the clichéd side . I mean there's the good looking hero , a good scientist , an evil misguided scientist , a reporter , the uncaring Mayor who doesn't want to cancel a local festival for money reasons , the police guy & the disposable victims , they're all here . The film is pretty dull to watch , it's far from exciting as it plods along in a fairly standard linear way , there is at first an unidentified threat , hero identifies threat & then destroys threat & gets the girl & that's it , that's as much & as original as Deadly Swarm strives to be , it's as simple & straight forward as that . The character's are OK & it moves along at a reasonable pace but I just couldn't stop myself from becoming bored with it . There's a real lack of action or Wasp attacks & the climax absolutely sucks & isn't worth watching the preceding 80 minutes to see . I'm not sure about the start either , are the filmmakers really trying to tell us that a deadly species of Wasp lives only in the abandoned ruins of a Aztec temple ( or whatever it is ) & never leave it's confines , I mean Wasp's can fly can't they ? Why don't they just fly away ? Why live in some ruins ? What do they eat ? Why has no one ever seen them before ? Also , while on the subject of these Wasp's they're a bit dull & mundane in themselves aren't they ? I mean their not mutated Wasp's , not genetically engineered Wasp's , giant over-sized Wasp's or anything like that they're just , well ordinary looking Wasp's which just didn't inspire or excite me at all . Director Andresen doesn't do anything particularly memorable , the film has a certain made-for-TV look & feel to it . When you think about it Deadly Swarm doesn't make a whole lot of sense , there are no scares , there's no shocks & the Wasp attack scenes are pretty bad with terrible CGI . There is no gore whatsoever , a few people covered in stings but that's it apart from a scene when a swarm of Wasp's emerge from someones stomach but the CGI is so bad during this scene it doesn't count & there's no blood either . Technically Deadly Swarm is competent & generally well made except for some awful special effects , the Mexican locations are quite bright & nice but hardly worth watching the film for . The acting wasn't up to much & didn't do anything for me . Deadly Swarm is a lame killer bug film that lacks any gore , any action & has a predictable & dull story . If you haven't already seen 100 films like this ( which I have unfortunately ) then you may like it as it's watchable but it won't knock anyone's socks off that's for sure . Only if your desperate or easily pleased .
499164	1355507	486099	4.0	Another Nu Image creature feature , average at best .	Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep is set in a stretch of Ocean called the Desolation Passage where marine archaeologist Nicole ( Victoria Pratt ) & her crew are searching for a couple of legendary Greek artifacts , a ceremonial Trojan war mask & a hugely valuable Opal . Unfortunately Nicole & her crew are hampered by a few unforeseen problems , first off is Maxwell Odemus ( Jack Scalia ) the son of a Greek mafia gangster who wants the two relics returned to Greece by any means necessary & there's also the small fact that a gigantic squid is guarding the precious bounty & basically kills anyone who goes near it . Can Nicole beat the odds , find the treasure & become famous or will she & her crew end up as squid food ? Directed by Tibor Takacs this is yet another by-the-numbers Nu Image produced creature feature the likes of which I'm sick of . The script by Sean Keller & Brian D . Young has all the usual clichés & plot devices these creature features do , there's the beautiful female scientist , a rugged male hero type , there's the disposable character's who are included for no other reason other than to be killed & of course there's the assortment of bad guys who want something valuable that some mutated badly CGI animated creature of some sort is either guarding or is just generally in the way of . There really isn't anything original , fresh or new about Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep at all & quite frankly it's a bit of a chore to sit through , there are already loads of these bad killer creature feature type films out there & this doesn't do the sub genre's reputation any favours . I sat there thinking I'd already this dozens of times before & I'm right , scientists look for something , get attacked by monster , hero kills monster & saves girl at the end , that's all there is too it . The character's are bland & forgettable as is the dialogue , the giant squid isn't in it nearly enough & doesn't do anything particularly special when it does make an appearance . It's all very predictable & isn't even unintentionally funny , if you really like these creature features , someone out there has to or they wouldn't keep making them , then you'll probably enjoy Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep to some extent but for those of us who are really bored of this type of film I urge you to steer well clear of it . Director Takacs was once a decent genre filmmaker with titles like The Gate ( 1987 ) & I , Madman ( 1989 ) but he seems to have gone down the creature feature route with dreck like this , Rats ( 2003 ) , Mansquito ( 2005 ) , Ice Spiders ( 2007 ) & his latest epic MegaSnake ( 2007 ) ! This made-for-TV film is quite well made , the giant squid CGI computer effects aren't as bad as I had expected although that's not to say they are good . The version I saw was titled Deadly Waters which is what it was shot under , apparently the Sci-Fi Channel's website held a competition for fans to come up with a better title & I guess Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep won which I suppose is why the word ' Kraken ' is never used in the film itself . Forget about any gore , there's a severed leg , some blood & a cool decapitation by fishing line but nothing else that graphic or worth mentioning . I'm also sorry to inform you that there is no nudity at all . The supposed budget of about $2 , 100 , 000 doesn't sound too bad actually so it's a surprise that overall the film is rather flat , bland & forgettable . The acting isn't great from nobody worth mentioning . Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep is another creature feature that is virtually indistinguishable from any other , catch it on the Sci-Fi Channel for sure but don't go wasting your money on it .
499397	1355507	79135	4.0	Not for all tastes , including mine unfortunately . . .	Fascination is set in the year 1905 & starts ( properly ) when thief Mark ( Jean-Marie Lemaire ) double crosses a gang of crooks & runs off with a bag full of gold & the crooks in hot pursuit . Mark happens upon a large Château surrounded by water with only one bridge offering access , Mark feels this would make a perfect hiding place until the cover of night . Inside he finds two young attractive women , Eva ( Brigitte Lahaie ) & Elisabeth ( Franca Mai ) who just happen to be lesbians . Mark holds them hostage at gunpoint & has sex with one of them . Eva & Elisabeth try to convince Mark to stay for a mysterious reunion that they are having that very night , Mark sticks around , out of curiosity apparently , until the first guest arrives Helene ( Fanny Magier ) . As four more female guests arrive it fast approaches midnight which seems to hold some significance that when Mark discovers what it is he wish he hadn't . . . This French production was written & directed by Jean Rollin & it didn't do much for me . While I respect other people's opinions that Rollin's films are artistic , dream like & visually stunning I don't think that about Fascination at all . Don't get me wrong there are some very nice shots & imagery in Fascination , Eva wandering around with a long robe & scythe being a particularly memorable scene , the pigeon loft scene is visually unusual & the Gothic Château setting is impressive & adds a great deal to the film , but overall I just felt it was cheaply filmed with Rollin lingering on shots & keeping his camera rolling for far too long , as a consequence at times this slows Fascination down to a virtual stand still . The one area that I do agree with the general opinion is that Rollin isn't particularly interested in story telling or a coherent plot which is a shame because if he put some of the effort that he puts in his visuals into a decent entertaining film than he'd have a winner on his hands . There is virtually no dialogue in Fascination & the plot is basic & somewhat predictable . One more thing I must state at this point is that there are no traditional Vampires in Fascination at all , no fangs , no stakes through the heart & no sleeping in coffins . There is some brief blood drinking but it's not for any sort of supernatural reasoning . I also found Fascination's exploitation elements lacking , maybe I was expecting too much but there is virtually no blood or gore & the sex & nudity seemed very tame , there is one lesbian scene & two sex scenes & that's your lot . Having said that these French women are very pretty & easy on the eyes . I don't know , maybe I'm missing something here but I just didn't find anything here to gain any sort of enjoyment from apart from some nice looking locations & a bit of nudity . Finally Fascination commits the fatal mistake of being boring & slow & at just under 80 minutes that's not a good thing to think , I can forgive almost anything as long as a film entertains me & Fascination simply didn't . I just can't imagine any regular modern cinema goer getting much from this arty mess .

Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) gets the job of finding out how Frank died , after the autopsy & some tests it becomes clear to Quincy that Frank died from a cyst in his brain that became detached when he was tackled on the field . Quincy knows his stuff & determines that the cyst was congenital & that Franks brother Steve ( Scott Colomby ) might have the same rare condition , Quincy warns the boy's father Walter ( Eugene Roche ) but he wants his son to compete in an important game the following Friday , a game which if he is right Quincy fears could kill Steve . . . Episode 8 from season 3 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton ( also co-writer ) & without wishing to sound unkind is for my money the worst Quincy episode from the whole of the third season which otherwise is pretty much uniformly excellent with some great episodes . Now , I like the Quincy episodes where he has to use his medical knowledge & skills to uncover a crime & / or catch a murderer while I find the stories which concentrate on some moral issue very dull , usually patronising & when viewed today often very outdated . Unfortunately for Main Man it falls very much into the later type of story & therefore I didn't like it , simple as that really . You know while watching this yesterday I was thinking to myself what possible reason could either Steve or his dad Walter have to make him play that football game when he might have the same brain condition that killed Steve's brother & Walter's other son less than a week before ? I know about the nonsense where Walter wanted Steve to succeed but at the cost of his life ? I'm sorry & I know people do all sorts of strange things but I was never convinced by anything either Steve or Walter said that prevented him getting checked out at the Hospital . At the usual 50 minutes ( without commercials ) in length Main Man had little to sustain my interest , there's no murder mystery , there's no suspense or intrigue & this one is more about Quincy's diplomatic skills rather than his medical ones , a disappointment & not an episode I'd ever be in any hurry to see again . This time around Quincy gets assaulted & roughed up by a team of American football players repeatedly throwing the ball as hard as they can into his stomach ! Also check out Quincy's stylish 70's shirt during this scene , it's well groovy . Otherwsie Main Man is pretty unremarkable & forgettable . I did spot a goof at the end though , the football game where the end scenes are shot is supposed to be between the ( obviously fictitious ) Bears & Bobcats but there's a banner in the stands which clearly says ' Go Bulldogs ' which I would assume is the name of one of the real football teams that were playing when this was shot . The acting is alright , again though it's the regular's that impress while Julie Adams makes the first of her three guest appearances on Quincy all playing different character's although she is perhaps best known for her role as the love interest of the fish-man from The Creature from the Black Lagoon ( 1954 ) ! Main Man is in my opinion the worst Quincy episode of season three & it's as simple & straight forward as that . No murder , no mystery & no entertainment , even the cheesy happy comedy ending involving pizza can't save it .
499085	1355507	681827	4.0	Not the sort of episode I enjoy but I can see what it's trying to do .	Quincy M . E . : Scream to the Skies starts as Transglobal passenger flight 442 carrying 147 crew & passengers from Los Angeles to Chicago is struck by lightening & is forced to land in the Ocean just off the coast . Word quickly reaches the emergency services & a full scale rescue is mounted , the Los Angeles county coroner's office has the unpleasant task of performing the autopsies & identifying the dead including Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who is devastated by what he sees . Upset by all the needless death & fully aware that most if not all of the passengers exited the crashed plane safely only to die of hypothermia in the freezing Ocean waters Quincy sets out on a campaign to make sure all commercial flights over water are equipped with life rafts . . . Episode 11 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Ron Satlof & is an odd episode for a few reasons . For a start I should say that Scream to the Skies is an entirely moralistic episode that was produced solely for the reason of highlighting inadequacies in airline safety & in particular the absence of life rafts on planes although sitting here writing this in 2008 some twenty seven years after Scream to the Skies was made I am not sure if that message is still relevant or whether planes are now obliged to carry life rafts . The one unusual aspect of Scream to the Skies as a Quincy episode is that Quincy spends the first half of the episode really depressed , not talking to anyone & refusing to go back to work which is totally unheard of for the character . But then about halfway through he miraculously snaps out of it & tries to get the Government to force the FAA to make life rafts compulsory before a strangely downbeat ending in which the airline takes out a court order against Quincy saying anything that might hurt their business . I must admit that I like the murder mystery episodes of Quincy & Scream to the Skies has no murder , no mystery , Quincy doesn't get to use his medical skills & knowledge to solve a crime & the first half of the episode is quite annoying watching Quincy sit around feeling sorry for himself . Scream to the Skies features some Plan 9 from Outer Space ( 1959 ) style special effects , the model plane that crashes at the start looks terrible & you can see it held up by wires . Also while watching the start I was wondering where all the other emergency services were , why would Qyuincy a medical examiner be the first one on the scene & as far as I could see the only doctor there ? Wouldn't there have been helicopters & dozens of boats ? According to the IMDb certain scenes in this were shot at Bob Hope Airport . The one thing that makes Scream to the Skies watchable is another compelling performance from Klugman who is again superb in the role , from sadness & sorrow to anger & determination he gives a terrific performance here . Scream to the Skies is not the sort of Quincy episode that I enjoy & I will say right now that I didn't like it at all but for another top performance from Klugman . There are much better episodes out there than this heavy handed moralistic nonsense .
497744	1355507	840304	4.0	" We gotta go down there & blow those hairy mother's away . " Better than average Sci-Fi Channel Creature Feature .	Ice Spiders is set in the Lost Mountain skiing resort in Logan County in Utah where hotshot skier Dan ' Dash ' Dashiell ( Patrick Muldoon ) works as a ski instructor , local ranger Rick Dickerson ( K . Danor Gerald ) ask's Dash for help in searching for two missing hunter's on a nearby mountain range which Dash dutifully agrees to . They find one of the hunters dead , horribly mutilated & the other cocooned in what looks like Spider's silk . Then they are attacked a giant genetically created Spider that has escaped from a nearby Government laboratory , with six deadly giant Spider's on the loose in total no-one is safe as it's up to ex-marine & all round hero Dash to go way beyond the call of duty to save the day . . . Directed by Tibor Takács this is yet another ' Creature Feature ' Sci-Fi Channel original that is far from original & is pretty standard stuff from start to finish . The script features everything any seasoned ' Creature Feature ' lover would expect , there's the young teenage cast , the all American hero who has to overcome some sort of fear to save the day , genetically created creatures of some sort developed for military purposes , bad CGI computer effects , an isolated location for the Spider's to attack & the human cast to get stuck in , a corrupt scientist who only cares about the experiment & not human life , a military presence & of course a love interest for the lead hero . It's all here in abundance . Ice Spiders is far from the worst of it's kind that I have seen , it's still not a particularly good film by any stretch of the imagination but I did enjoy it to a certain extent more than I thought I would . The pace is good & from the opening Spider attack scene right through to the end the film never slows down & I can't say I was bored although what I was more than aware that what I was watching was still pretty average stuff . The character's are alright & aren't as annoying as usual , the plot is fairly standard stuff & it's clear not much thought went into other than to hang the basic ' genetically creature giant creature on the loose ' plot around & there's a few amusing scenes here if your in the right mood I suppose . The dialogue is of often unintentionally funny & the film doesn't seem to take itself too seriously & while I would hesitate to describe Ice Spiders as a good film I certainly don't think it's a terrible one either . There is no build up to the revelation of the Spider's in Ice Spiders & one is seen in it's full CGI glory within the first three minutes , the cheap looking CGI computer effects range from the strictly average to the absolutely awful . There's no real build up of tension to any of the attack scenes either so the film lacks any scares or any atmosphere & the entire thing takes place during the day which makes things easy to see but setting a horror film about giant Spider's in broad daylight cuts down the options for suspense sequences & as such the film lacks any . There's some minor gore here , someone is seen ripped in half , there are a few mutilated bodies , some blood splatter & some mutilated animal bodies too . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 the production values are alright , the mountain wilderness scenery is nice enough to look at & poor CGI computer effects apart it's reasonably well made . The acting is mostly poor from people who look like they don't want to be there , Patrick Muldoon in particular looks to be putting zero effort into things . Even though Vanessa Williams was forty three when she shot Ice Spiders she looks about nineteen in it . Ice Spiders is a slightly better than usual Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' although that in itself isn't saying much & is certainly no recommendation . Not bad for it's type but since it's type is usually so awful it's still nothing worth busting a gut to see .
497791	1355507	95631	5.0	Didn't do much for me at all .	Midnight Run starts in Los Angeles where ex-Chicago cop Jack Walsh ( Robert De Niro ) works as a bounty hunter looking for & capturing criminals who have jumped bail & then collect the reward from bondsman Eddie Moscone ( Joe Pantoliano ) , Jack doesn't like it but it's a living . Eddie ask's Jack to find ex-accountant Jonathan ' the Duke ' Mardukas ( Charles Grodin ) who stole fifteen million dollars from a Las Vegas mobster named Jimmy Serrano ( Dennis Farina ) & has run out on Eddie owing him $450 , 000 in bail money . Eddie needs the Duke back within five days , Jack accepts the job & finds the Duke in New York but getting him back to Los Angeles turns out to more difficult than Jack had thought with the FBI , gangsters & rival bounty hunters on their tails . . . Produced & directed by Martin Brest ( who also has a small cameo in the film as the Airline ticket clerk at Las Vegas ) I notice that Midnight Run seems to be a very popular film which I can't relate to at all , in fact I think it's average at best & boring rubbish at worst . The script by George Gallo takes the buddy buddy mismatched partners thrown into some comedy crime caper action thriller template & turns it into a staggeringly uneventful two hours . I am sorry but to me the vast majority of Midnight Run is just bland chit chat between Walsh & the Duke as lots of other interested parties chase them across America . A lot of films use the whole mismatched partner thing & use it to create tensions , be it racial tension as in Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) or class tension as in Tango & Cash ( 1989 ) & here in Midnight Run it's the whole criminal vs lawman type tensions . The action scenes are poor & don't live too long in the memory . The script also likes to throw in profanity at every opportunity just for the hell of it , it seems almost every second word is a swear word & while I have nothing against profanity the sheer amount of it in Midnight Run smacks of swearing for swearing's sake . The character's are also poor , we hardly ever find anything out about the Duke , Walsh comes across better but then it's clichés all the way with the typical Las Vegas mobster , the FBI man who Walsh manages to stay one step ahead of all the time & the rival bounty hunter who just can't quite get the better of Walsh . With lots of people chasing around after each I was expecting some sort of huge climax but even that is low key & forgettable . Also I thought Walsh tracked the Duke down rather easily , I mean the FBI couldn't find him , Las Vegas gangsters couldn't find him but little old Jack Walsh could . In the space of a single day too . Director Brest was obviously hired by Paramount to make another comedy action thriller in the vein of his previous film Beverly Hills Cop ( 1984 ) , which coincidentally also contains a foul mouthed cop character , & wanted to cast Cher as Mardukas , & then Robin Williams but Brest hired Grodin against the studios wishes & Paramount dropped the film with Universal then stepping in to take over production . Apparently Bruce Willis was considered for the Mardukas role but was turned down & as such he went on to make Die Hard ( 1988 ) , both films opened on the same weekend & it's fair to say Willis would have the last laugh . The action scenes really are forgettable , there's a crashing helicopter , an average car chase & that's it . With a supposed budget of about $30 , 000 , 000 Midnight Run is well made for what it is but most of it is rather talky for my tastes . The acting is alright , De Niro is just a fine actor anyway but I thought Grodin was poor & uncharismatic . Midnight Run is an average buddy buddy mismatched partner type comedy crime caper , I can't say I hated it but I can't say I loved it either . Followed by three made-for-telly sequels , Another Midnight Run ( 1994 ) , Midnight Runaround ( 1994 ) & Midnight Run for Your Life ( 1994 ) .
497632	1355507	352220	5.0	Despite it not being very good I thought it had a few things going for it .	The Brink starts in ' West Orange , NJ 1931 ' as inventor Thomas Edison's ( Monty Wall ) latest creation has unexpected consequences . . . Jump forward to the present day where engineering student Megan ( Rachel Blazer ) has tracked down the schematics for Edison's invention which supposedly brings ghosts into our world , Megan convinces two of her student friends Bianca ( Heather Chase ) & Todd ( Jason Flowers ) to help her build the machine which they agree to . They set themselves up in an old abandoned & isolated farmhouse 50 miles from anywhere of note & get to work , they quickly discover that Megan's ex boyfriend Leo ( Jeff Ryan ) has joined the party as the ' voice of reason ' . Together they build the machine & turn it on at which point a ghostly figure ( Matt Miller ) appears holding an axe which it then uses to try & kill Todd , whoever said ghosts were friendly . . . Edited , photographed , co-written , produced & directed by Benjamin Cooper I certainly didn't love The Brink but I saw some potential here & thought it was watchable if nothing else . The script by Cooper & John Bowker takes itself extremely seriously & is a little slow to get going which it's main problem , films such as The Brink need to hit you hard straight away & keep you interested throughout , something which the makers of The Brink didn't do & it's over 40 minutes into the film before the four friends turn on the machine by which time it will have probably lost 75 % of it's audience who will have either turned it off & stuck Terminator 2 ( 1991 ) in the DVD player or switched it over to MTV . Hey , I'm all for a slow measured build up but this is ridiculous & quite frankly there's not that much to build up too ! The character's are OK actually & despite being of the teenage variety they didn't annoy me that much , the dialogue was alright & the basic story had potential especially a really neat twist towards the end which a lot more should have been made out of . Generally speaking The Brink isn't a particularly great film & I won't be in any hurry to see it again but there are one or two nice moments here & the story with it's twist had potential which unfortunately wasn't fully realised probably to the low budget & technical restrictions . Director Cooper does a decent job & I have to say The Brink actually looks like a proper film as opposed to a glorified home movie which is how I think a lot of recently made low budget shot on a camcorder type horror junk that litters video shop shelves look . I wouldn't say it's particularly scary but there are one or two atmospheric moments dotted throughout , there's a distinct lack of gore & violence as well . Someone gets her head sliced in half horizontally with an axe accompanied by a sound effect that resembles someone stepping in some mud & there's a chopped off hand but nothing else worth mentioning . I'm not sure what sort of budget The Brink had but I'll bet it was pretty low so bear that in mind , at least it's reasonably well made & watchable if nothing else . The Brink has a similar storyline to White Noise ( 2005 ) & even though it was apparently shot 2 years before White Noise came out The Brink was released straight-to-video / DVD after . The acting was OK but nothing special . The Brink was better than I had expected although to be honest that wasn't going to be hard , I can't really recommend it as my head tells me it's a terrible film but my heart says otherwise . I'll leave this one up to you & give it a middle of the road .
498175	1355507	70622	5.0	Average 70's mad scientist film .	Sssssss starts as brilliant herpetologist Dr . Carl Stoner ( Strother Martin ) approaches a fellow colleague & high school teacher Dr . Ken Daniels ( Richard B . Shull ) about the possibility of taking on one of his students as a lab assistant as his last one suddenly left , Daniels recommends David Blake ( Dirk Benedict ) who accepts the position . Dr . Stoner conducts his research & experiments in a laboratory in his large isolated country house who he shares with his daughter Kristina ( Heather Menzies ) , Stoner puts David to work straight away & also informs him that he will have to have a series of immunisation jabs in case he is bitten & gives him his first . However , Dr . Stoner is in fact injecting David with a serum that will transform humans into half snake , half human hybrids that will be able to survive the apocalypse & / or global warming due to pollution ( the answer to two everyday problems in one small syringe ! ) . Dr . Stoner didn't count on the fact that his daughter Kristina & David become romantically involved ( before he turns green ) which leaves him with a moral dilemma , it also appears that his previous assistant has been reported missing . As Dr . Stoner's experiments & misdemeanours come to light just how far will he go to protect & further his work . . . Released in 1973 on a double bill with The Boy Who Cried Werewolf & also known under the much better title of Ssssnake in the UK Sssssss was directed by Bernard L . Kowalski & I personally thought it was average . The script by Hal Dresner could have been better , it takes itself extremely seriously which considering the material probably wasn't the best idea ever . It's a bit on the pedestrian side too , by far the most interesting plot thread in Sssssss is David being turned into a man snake but until the final 15 or so minutes this aspect of the film feels almost secondary to the various other dull sub plots , themes & ideas . The killing of the bully Steve ( Reb Brown ) seems very tacked on & completely unnecessary , the in fighting between Stoner & Daniels over the grant money amounts to nothing & has no bearing on anything when the film finishes & what about the snake man at the carnival ? What happens to him ? ! I also couldn't figure out the end , why did he let the cobra bite him again ? Why does the film just suddenly finish ? Having said that if you've got nothing better better to do for 100 plus minutes then Sssssss will pass the time harmlessly enough , just don't expect an action packed masterpiece . Director Kowalski does an OK job , the film looks & feels very 70's . The set pieces are a bit disappointing as most of the snakes that are supposed to look menacing just lie there doing nothing in particular , this especially hurts the scene when Daniels has to grab a key from inside a tank with a very docile looking snake inside . The bit when he's attacked by a lethargic lazy looking python doesn't fare much better in this respect . Forget about any blood or gore & the version I watched has Heather Menzies nude scene covered up with some superimposed leaves ! With a supposed budget of about $1 , 300 , 000 Sssssss seemed a fairly well funded film , it's generally well made throughout & the snake man make-up effects are pretty good although the final transformation looks very dated & the final ' creature ' looks suspiciously like a normal snake , where did David's body mass go exactly ! ? Apparently the poisonous snakes weren't milked or defanged during production , just think one wrong move & we may never have had Face in the A-Team ! The acting was OK . Sssssss is an OK way to pass the time but there are plenty of unanswered questions & a loose narrative . Fun in a ' they don't make ' em like this anymore ' sort of way but by no means brilliant .
497251	1355507	105414	5.0	Largely uneventful psychological thriller .	Single White Female is set in New York City where Allison Jones ( Bridget Fonda ) shares an apartment with her boyfriend Sam ( Steven Weber ) , unfortunately Allison finds out that Sam has slept with his ex-wife & kicks him out . Feeling lonely in a large apartment Allison advertises for a flatmate eventually letting a room to a seemingly normal & pleasant young lady named Hedra ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) . At first things are fine but when Allison decides to take Sam back & wants Hedra to move out things take a sinister turn as Hedra turns out to be a bit of a psycho . . . Produced & directed Barbet Schroeder one has to say I was looking forward to watching Single White Female but ended up being disappointed with it . The script by Don Roos was based on the novel ' SWF Seeks Same ' by John Lutz & is a rather slow moving & tame psychological thriller that takes absolutely ages to get to where it's going . I was sat down watching this last night & it felt like I had been watching it for hours before anything of any note had happened , I'm all for a good solid steady build up that develops the character's & story but there has to be something there to maintain ones interest , right ? Also when all said & done I found Single White Female disappointing tame & very predictable , there's nothing here to get you on the edge of your seat , there's nothing here that is going to shock & the character's who you think will survive do & those you think won't don't . A lot more could have been done with the story , Hedra isn't given much background at all & we never really get inside her head to understand her motives or what she's thinking , most of the film is set in the same apartment & again I'd have liked Hedra to maybe ruin every aspect of Allison's life including her profession . As a whole Single White Female is a passable if forgettable thriller that could have been so much better if the makers had taken a few more risks & upped the pace a little . Director Schroeder does alright , he uses the large apartment set quite well but there's not much style to the film & it's largely forgettable . The makers have been rather conservative & it's not what i would call scary , there's not much tension & the violence levels are virtually zero . There a few gunshot wounds , someone is stabbed with a screwdriver & someone is killed by having the stiletto heel of a shoe stuck into their eyeball but otherwise nothing . There is some nudity though from both Fonda & Leigh including a brief masturbation scene ( it's not graphic so don't get excited ) . Technically the film is good with high production values , it's well made without ever being spectacular in any way . The acting is fine from a decent cast but they really aren't given much to do . Single White Female could have been a great film if the makers had cranked up the tension , scares & thrills unfortunately they didn't so it isn't . Worth a watch if there isn't anything else on the other side or if your desperate but it's all rather average so don't bust a gut to see it .
498816	1355507	451134	5.0	" My girls aren't whores , their escort entertainers . " Not too bad considering .	Mustang Sally starts as six young guys , Josh ( Mark Parrish ) , Mike ( Erik Fellows ) , Toby ( Sonny Marler ) , Luke ( Garrison Koch ) , Seamus ( Sean McGene ) & Ryan ( Al Santos ) are sitting in the local small town diner where they overhear some bikers talking about a nearby brothel run by a woman named Mustang Sally ( Elizabeth Daily ) & decide they'd all like a piece of the action , so to speak . They jump in Josh's car & head right on over there , when they arrive they are greeted by Sally & introduced to her ' girls ' whom all pick a guy ( shouldn't it have been the other way round ? ) & then head off to the various bedrooms for some fun . Unfortunately for the boys these hookers are homicidal maniacs with revenge on their minds . . . This Canadian American co-production was co-scored , written , co-produced & directed by Iren Koster who also had a part in the film as someone called Popsie , I actually thought Mustang Sally was an OK film by which to pass 90 odd minutes . The script for the first half of the film plays like a cheap porno with these guys being introduced to some hot birds & then going off together for some fun & it's not until past this point that the horror kicks in , in fact the first half of Mustang Sally has no horror elements in it at all . Now this would have been fine but the sex scenes are really tame , there's barely any nudity , there's no variety apart from the dominatrix who gets someone to kiss her boots & ties him up & it may disappoint some in that regard , at this point I just felt a golden opportunity to be totally perverted , sleazy & exploitative had been missed . However the horror kicks in & there's some decent bloodletting & a surprisingly effective little twist at the end . It moves along at a good pace & I was never bored unlike a lot of low budget horror these day , the teenage character's weren't that annoying & it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously . Director Kastor does alright , it's not exactly the most visually stylish film you'll ever see but it's quite well shot all the same . There's nothing particularly sexy in this , nothing explicit & the film doesn't seem to want to build up any tension or shocks . The gore levels aren't high , someone is stabbed , there's a scythe in someones chest & neck , someone has their tongue cut out & people are shot although it's not that graphic , the nudity count is also surprisingly low considering the potential of the situation & the basic material . The budget was probably low as seen in the end when Mustang Sally's house blows up for no apparent reason , it is shown as a blurred reflection on the Sheriff's sunglasses as he ' talks ' us through what's just happened because he reports it over his own radio back to the police station . As a whole it's a bit cheap looking . The acting isn't great but it ain't too bad I suppose considering the material . Mustang Sally , maybe better known as Mustang Sally's Horror House , is a reasonably decent horror / wannabe porn film that doesn't really excel in either genre but is an OK watch if you've got nothing better to do .
498005	1355507	485774	5.0	" He killed , like , a gazillion people . " Straight-to-DVD slasher , average at best .	Heartstopper starts late one stormy night as convicted serial killer Jonathan Chambers ( James Binkley ) is executed in the electric chair , he is pronounced dead & taken to a nearby hospital to undergo an autopsy . However en-route Sheriff Berger ( Robert Englund ) runs into a suicidal teenager named Sara Wexler ( Meredith Henderson ) crouched in the middle of the road , she is put in the ambulance along with Chambers dead body & taken to the hospital . Sara is seen to & Chambers body is taken to be autopsied , however Chambers isn't dead & comes back to life . He needs to change bodies & Sara is it , he stalks the corridors of the hospital looking for her & ripping out the heart of anyone who gets in his way . . . This Canadian production was directed by Bob Keen & one has to say that Heartstopper isn't the most enjoyable was to spend 85 minutes . The script by Vlady Pildysh & Warren P . Sonoda takes itself very seriously & seems to have taken it's inspiration from Wes Craven's Shocker ( 1989 ) & House III : The Horror Show ( 1989 ) with it's evil deranged killer back from the electric chair type plot , in fact when I think about it there hasn't been an evil deranged killer back from the electric chair type horror film for quite a while which is understandable really . Here in Heartstopper no explanation is given as to why or how Jonathan Chambers survived & came back from the dead , none . Sure there's some sort of living tattoo on his arm & he has some sort of magical pendant around his neck but no concrete explanation is given at any point . Once Chambers comes back to life Heartstopper goes into standard clichéd & predictable teen slasher mode as the rest of the film is spent running around the darkest hospital in film history with Sara & some black dude trying to survive , at no point does anyone suggest they should try to phone anyone which is odd . When the lights go out why don't the generators come on ? Why is it so hard to find a way out ? Can't they just open a window & climb out or something ? One character remarks whether it's a hospital or a prison which is a very good point , I can't believe there is not one single exit or window they could have left through . The character's aren't great , the main teenage leads are annoying & Chambers as a villain is awful as he spouts some really bad dialogue which I suspect was meant to be scary & meaningful but ends up sounding terrible , he just has no on screen menace at all . Director Keen started off in the horror film biz as a special effects make-up man working on films such as Krull ( 1983 ) , Lifeforce ( 1985 ) , Highlander ( 1986 ) , Hellraiser ( 1987 ) , Waxwork ( 1988 ) , Candyman ( 1992 ) , Event Horizon ( 1997 ) & Dog Soldiers ( 2002 ) amongst others & has more recently turned his attention to directing . No offence Bob but stick to what your good at & directing isn't one of them . Heartstopper is set in probably the darkest & most underpopulated hospital in history , there's about six doctors & six patients ! There is a fair amount of gore which saves Heartstopper from being a complete dud , there are the expected ripped out hearts , someones stomach & chest are torn open , there's scalpels in eyeballs & slashed throats , there's mutilated bodies & corpses with their faces torn off & there's plenty of blood splatter too . I wouldn't say Heartstopper is scary , in fact because of the distinct lack of lighting it becomes very frustrating to watch . There's an annoying scene near the start where the doctor is about to perform the autopsy on Chambers body & ask's for the lights to be turned out ! I have never performed an autopsy myself but I would imagine being able to see & having the lights on was a basic requirement ! According to the IMDb Heartstopper had a budget of about $3 , 000 , 000 which I must say does sound quite a lot for what actually ended up on screen , there's nothing here which stands out although it is well made with good special effects . Shot in Ontario in Canada . The acting isn't great , it's alright but not great . Mr cameo himself Robert Englund makes yet another smallish appearance in a cheap horror flick , he's made a career out of it hasn't he ? Heartstopper is an OK teen slasher , it only lasts for 80 odd minutes so at least it's short & there's a fair amount of pleasing gore but a silly script that has lots of loose ends & an annoying location means this is average at best . Heartstopper isn't the worst slasher out there but it's far from the best , you can do better if you try .
497310	1355507	74483	5.0	Didn't do much for me .	The Enforcer is set in San Francisco & starts as a terrorist organisation that calls themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force break into an arms warehouse & steal a load of rock launchers & various other weapons , homicide cop Frank DiGiorgio ( John Mitchum ) catches them in the act but is shot by the gang . DiGiorgio dies in hospital the next day & his partner ' Dirty ' Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) is annoyed , very annoyed & together with his trusty Magnum sets out to bring the People's Revolutionary Strike Force down single handedly if necessary . Things get complicated though when he gets a new rookie female partner Inspector Kate Moore ( Tyne Daly ) & the People's Revolutionary Strike Force decide to kidnap the mayor ( John Crawford ) & hold him to ransom . . . Directed by James Fargo this was the third entry in the popular Dirty Harry series of action flicks to star Clint Eastwood as the title character & I must admit The Enforcer didn't do a great deal for me . The fairly routine script by Stirling Silliphant & Dean Riesner which was apparently originally called ' Moving Target ' takes itself pretty seriously & just isn't that good I'm afraid , it's well short on action & set-pieces , the story is dull & turns out to be nothing more than a simple kidnapping & as a whole it never got me going . The bad guy's are also underused here , they barely feature at all & after the first few minutes they completely disappear until near the end , the main bad guy Bobby Maxwell has to be one of the weakest on screen baddies ever , he doesn't get any decent lines , he doesn't get much of an opportunity to be evil & he puts up virtually no resistance at the end as Harry blows him away . The one aspect of the film I did like was Harry's partner , I did think The Enforcer was going to turn into a mismatched cop buddy buddy type flick as he is paired up with a woman but it doesn't quite work out that way & while there's mutual respect by the end it never falls into the established clichés . In a way The Enforcer could be described as the very first mismatched partner action flick but it doesn't follow the same path many other's would take after 48 Hrs . ( 1982 ) which is more suited to the accolade . Director Fargo does alright but the film is pretty bland , a bit lifeless & the action scenes are low key to say the least . There's no car chases , very few shot outs , one fight & little in the way of anything spectacular or particularly memorable including a rushed ending . The Enforcer has a somewhat sedate pace & I just found myself losing interest at various points , the whole film just feels lacklustre & like no-one had any enthusiasm apart from Tyne Daly who is pretty good in this a full 6 years before her stint as New York cop Lacey in Cagney & Lacey ( 1982 - 1988 ) . Technically the film is alright , there's nothing here that stands out as being particularly good or bad although I really hated some of the 70's style jazz music that played in the background especially during the scene when Harry chases the black dude . Actually shot in San Francisco & on Alcatraz this definitely has a somewhat gritty 70's feel to it . The acting is OK but nothing special . The Enforcer is an average 70's cop thriller , it doesn't really have enough action for modern audiences tastes & the story itself isn't anything to shout about either . It's OK but nothing special . The Enforcer was the third Dirty Harry film coming after Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) & Magnum Force ( 1973 ) & was itself followed by two sequels Sudden Impact ( 1983 ) & The Dead Pool ( 1989 ) .
498625	1355507	74408	5.0	" I made this myself with pure hog fat . " Director Franco's dull take on the Jack the Ripper legend .	Jack the Ripper starts at the ' Pike's Hole ' a whore house in the London district of Whitechapel as one of the girls Sally Brown ( Francine Custer ) rejects the advances of a client due to his unusual request & trudges off home on her own . While walking down the narrow back streets Sally is attacked & murdered by the now notorious serial killer known as ' Jack the Ripper ' ( Klaus Kinski ) who then takes the body to his female assistant Frieda ( Nikola Weisse ) who disposes of the messy remains the next morning in the Thames . Chief Inspector Anthony Selby ( Andreas Mannkopff ) of Scotland Yard is on the case but totally baffled & clueless . His only witnesses are a blind man named John Pritchard ( Hans Gaugler ) who seems able to identify the Ripper by use of smell , an old woman named Miss Higgins ( Ursula van Wiese ) , a fisherman named Charlie ( Herbery Fux ) who has found a severed hand & a couple of whores whose friend Jeanny ( Esther Studer ) has become the latest victim of the Ripper's killing spree . Inspector Selby starts to feel the pressure & has next to nothing to go on , feeling neglected his girlfriend Cynthia ( Josephine Chaplin ) decides to help him out . Cynthia dresses up as a whore & puts herself about hoping that she will attract the attentions of Jack the Ripper . . . This Swiss German co-production was written & directed by Jesus Franco & while a lot classier than his usual output his take on Jack the Ripper isn't particularly good . The script & how Franco approaches the story is a problem for starter , the identity of Jack the Ripper is revealed within the first few minutes so there is no mystery element whatsoever which then basically turns the film into a slasher like Halloween ( 1978 ) or Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) . Franco never really develops any aspect of his script to any degree of satisfaction , the incompetent Selby comes & goes & doesn't do much , the blackmailing of the Ripper is given a few minutes & nothing more , nothing about his assistant is explained like the small matter of why she helps him , Cynthia for most of the film doesn't feature until the end where she offers herself up as bait which raises questions in itself . Why ? What if she did meet the Ripper ? No one knew what she was doing so why wouldn't he just slice her up like his other victims ? No one she knew was threatened by the Ripper so why go it alone & risk her life ? The only connection she has to the case is that her boyfriend was working on it , not good enough motivation for me I'm afraid . There are obvious glaring inaccuracies as well , this is definitely not based on any solid evidence & feels like a slasher film with Jack the Ripper as the killer , nothing more . The Swiss locations double up as Victorian London surprisingly well except for the Thames for which Franco uses a stream & as someone who lives in the UK these scenes are actually quite funny to me . The film has an end which feels rushed & as a whole the film is far too slow & frankly dull while the Ripper's motivations are barely touched upon & are lazy & unoriginal to say the least . Director Franco has gained a reputation for sleaze so it may come as a surprise that Jack the Ripper is disappointingly tame , there are three or four scenes with nudity & only one big gore scene when the Ripper stabs a woman , starts to have sex with her & slices her breast off , other than that there is a severed hand , an eyeball & a couple of stabbings . On the positive side it's very well made for a Franco film & he shows that he does have at least some basic talent behind the camera if he puts the effort in . The cinematography by Peter Baumgartner & Peter Spoerri is very good for the most part with some excellent & atmospheric location shots plus a strong sense & use of colour throughout . The sets are convincing enough & pleasantly detailed while the costumes look a little suspicious like Franco stole or hired them from a local fancy dress shop but serve the film well . The dialogue & dubbing are ridiculous & totally remove any credibility the film may have had , people just don't naturally talk like this & you have to listen to some of this stuff to believe it . Basically the story isn't great , it just didn't grip or engage me as we all know who the Ripper is from the start . It's very slow , has a low body count with just three & very little exploitation with barely any nudity or gore & just didn't do much for me overall although having said that it's fairly watchable if your desperate . Stylish & well made but nothing special , probably just about worth a watch I suppose .
498400	1355507	95924	5.0	" I didn't tell nobody round here nothing . . . I'll be glad to tell you the same thing . " Average horror / thriller .	Pulse starts in an ordinary L . A . street which is disturbed by the antics of one of it's residents named Hank Jordan who is wrecking his house with a baseball bat , the police are called & break into Hank's house but find him dead . Young David Rockland ( Joseph Lawrence ) is flying into L . A . from Colorado to spend some time with his Father & Stepmother Bill ( Cliff De Young ) & Ellen ( Roxanne Hart ) , things go well at first but one night when David is left home alone the T . V . & other various electrical appliances seem to take a life of their own & after almost being burned alive by a pilot light David is understandably nervous . Then David hears about the stories concerning the Jordan's & what happened , David becomes convinced that there is an evil presence in his Father's house that will try to kill them , at first Bill isn't having any of it but as the mysterious ' accidents ' begin to add up he starts to change his mind . . . Written & directed by Paul Golding I thought Pulse was an average horror / thriller that never even came close to getting my pulse racing . The script doesn't seem to know what it wants to be or who it wants to appeal too & is loose to say the least , nothing is explained in any sort of detail . What the evil electrical force is or where it came from or what it's trying to do , absolutely nothing about it is revealed . I also think that Pulse will disappoint most potential viewers in the sense that as a fan of horror films which Pulse supposedly is I was expecting a widespread outbreak of electrical devices turning against their owners all across America but in actual fact the pulse never leaves the confines of one house even though it could go anywhere & it doesn't kill a single person on screen , that's right not one person is killed in Pulse which just isn't good enough as far as I'm concerned . Instead director Golding thinks his audience would rather sit through chunks of boring dialogue , stupid unexplained narrative & an annoying teenage kid as the lead , well Mr . Golding I can tell you now that most horror fans like films which are scary & contain some semblance of horror . As it is Pulse tells it's story competently enough despite it's lack of any explanations & while there's nothing spectacular about it it's an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes if you don't expect too much . Director Golding films everything without much style or visual flair but there are a few really effective scenes in which his camera goes ' into ' the electrical equipment & there are some nice close-up shots of the circuit boards & wiring as the pulse melts the solder & rearranges it for reasons I'm not sure about , these shots are easily the most memorable thing about Pulse which says it all really . Pulse isn't scary & there's not much of a horror atmosphere to it either . There are some really dumb bits at the end when David a young kid manages to stop his Father falling back by grabbing him even though his Father probably weighs three times that of David , it wouldn't work in reality would it ? Neither can I forget the scene when a circular saw manages to fire a screw at Bill & hit him in the forehead ! Forget about any proper gore , someone's hand gets cut , someone is burnt & a screw hits someone's forehead is all we get . Technically Pulse is alright , there's nothing really wrong with it . The acting is OK but again nothing special , Lawrence as the young kid gets very irritating . Pulse is an OK film , I'm sure there are people out there who will like it but for me it was too dull , it never explained itself & the decision not to kill anyone during the entire duration of the film was a bad one , a very bad one . There are better films out there .
498598	1355507	57295	5.0	" I bet this didn't happen in your filthy novels . " Good premise but ultimately wasted .	Matango , or under one of it's alternate titles Attack of the Mushroom People , Curse of the Mushroom People , Fungus of Terror , Matango the Fungus of Terror or Matango : Fungus of Terror as I saw it under , starts off the shores of Japan where five friends including businessman Fumio Kasai ( Yoshio Tsuchiya ) , an author named Etsuro Yoshida ( Hiroshi Tachikawa ) , radio & TV presenter Mami Sekiguchi ( Kumi Mizuno ) , University professor Kenji Murai ( Akira Kubo ) & his student Akiko Soma ( Miki Yashiro ) have hired a yacht owned & run by captain Naoyuki Sakeda ( Hiroshi Koizumi ) & a sailor named Senzo Koyama ( Kenji Sahara ) . They are caught in a vicious thunderstorm , the yacht is damaged & they become lost . They are very lucky that they drift towards an island & potential safety , once ashore they discover another wrecked ship that they use as a base . It appears to be some sort of scientific research ship on a mission to study the effects of nuclear testing & radiation . They also find books which warn not to eat the mushrooms which grow in abundance on the mysterious island but with food running very low , seven mouths to feed & tension growing several of the group cannot resist the temptation . Unfortunately for them the mushrooms have strange side effects , strange mutating side effects & the survivors quickly realise that they have to fight the mushroom men as well as hunger . . . This Japanese production was directed by veteran Ishiro Honda , Matango had a great premise & could have made for a good horror / monster film but when the finished product is viewed it has to go down as a big disappointment . The script by Takeshi Kimura & an uncredited Sakyo Komatsu takes itself 100 % seriously & is based on the on story ' The Vioce in the Night ' by William Hope Hodgson which I have not read so I cannot compare them . The film starts out promisingly enough with the group being stranded on the island & the scene being set but then it goes absolutely nowhere as the following 40 odd minutes is constant moaning & arguing amongst the group trying to decide what to do & petty squabbling as everyone tries to get the upper-hand . OK , listen I'm all for character development & a strong story but I really started to dislike these selfish annoying & irritating people which in turn made Matango hard to watch & like . I just wanted to see the mushroom people attack , unfortunately that doesn't happen until the last 10 minutes or so , until that point the mushroom people only make two brief appearances & are almost inconsequential to the dull melodramatics . I just found it a bit tedious & boring , I actually started to check my watch to see how long was left even though the film only lasts for a relatively short 70 minutes . Director Honda does a good job & he manages to create a great atmosphere especially the deserted ship with it's rundown equipment & fungus covered walls , it's a pretty creepy place . The mushroom people themselves aren't shown in any great detail & don't feature that much but they're pretty freaky looking & very effective when they make an appearance , I just wish they were in the film more . Technically Matango is very good , it's competent & generally well made throughout . The version I saw was a panned & scanned English dubbed travesty , huge chunks were obviously cut off each side of the frame & the dubbing was absolutely terrible . I'm not sure an original ratio Japanese language version would greatly improve it but it certainly couldn't be any worse . It's hard to tell whether the acting was good or not since the English dub was hardly the fault of the original Japanese cast , was it ? Matango was a huge disappointment for me , it's not a bad watch I suppose & at least it's short but when ' The End ' credit card appeared I couldn't help but feel short changed . Could have been great , as it is it's strictly average at best .
498533	1355507	94602	5.0	" You fckin Italian puke . " Steven Seagal's first film back when he was thin !	Above the Law is set in Chicago during 1988 where Nico Toscani ( co-producer Steven Seagal ) works as a tough narcotics cop , while forcibly removing his niece from a crack house he beats some information out of a punk & learns of a large shipment of drugs being imported into the country . Toscani sets a bust up & local drug dealer Salvano ( Daniel Faraldo ) is arrested , however instead of drugs Toscani finds lots of C4 explosives . After a C4 bomb goes off in his local Church Toscani digs deeper & discovers a plot by evil corrupt CIA agent Kurt Zagon ( Henry Silva ) to assassinate a senator who might expose him , once Zagon realise Toscani knows his plans he also becomes a target . . . This American Hong Kong co-production was co-written , co-produced & directed by Andrew Davis & is probably more notable for being Steven Seagal's feature film debut back when he was thin than for being any good , to be frank I don't think it's one of Seagal's better action films but it's far from his worst . The script by Steven Pressfield , Ronald Shusett & Davis is actually a touch dull , it aimlessly wanders between OK action set-pieces without much of a story to maintain ones interest . The basic message of Above the Law is that it is dangerous to have organisations which are , well , above the law & not accountable to anyone . It's not much of a message to be honest & the only reason anyone would be interested in watching Above the Law is for the action & violence , there are some trademark brutal fight scenes with Seagal chopping bad guy's hands off , breaking necks & beating people with baseball bats but it's a little low key at times . The character's are a bit clichéd & not particularly good , there is also a lot of profanity & bad language . In fact by the end of Above the Law I thought everyone's favourite two words were ' fcker ' & ' mother ' , not necessarily in that order of course . . . Director Davis & Seagal team up for the first time & would reunite for the much better Under Siege ( 1992 ) a few years later , here he directs the action in a rather workmanlike fashion with competence but nothing outstanding or that memorable . I just didn't think the action scenes were ' big ' enough if you get what I mean . I couldn't quite believe how young & thin Seagal looked in this , I really can't . Despite his stupid looking pony-tail he's quite impressive in this & looks as if he could kick your ass . Technically the film is fine , it's well made & functional but nothing that's going to win any awards . Shot on location in Illinois in Chicago . The acting is OK but everyone seems to swear constantly which gets annoying , Pam Grier & Henry Silva have roles while Sharon Stone gets almost top billing in the credits for about three minutes of screen time . Above the Law ( originally called Nico here in the UK ) is an average Seagal action flick , the only really notable aspect of it is that it was Seagal's feature film debut but that doesn't automatically make it any good , does it ?
496868	1355507	79285	5.0	" Your inadequate Major , in every area . . . " - " You have a beautiful body , may I use it ? " Watchable enough Sci-Fi horror film .	Saturn 3 starts just like Star Wars ( 1977 ) with a shot of space in which a giant spacecraft slowly enters the top of the frame & flies ' over ' the camera . Onboard Captain James ( an uncredited Douglas Lambert ) prepares to depart in a small spacecraft when a mysterious spacesuit & helmet wearing person named Benson ( Harvey Keitel , hideously dubbed throughout by Roy Dotrice ) opens an airlock & blasts the Captain into some protective wires which make him explode . This impostor takes the place of the Captain & leaves on his own for one of the moons of Saturn . Once there Benson lands in an experimental food research station called Saturn 3 . There are only two people who live on Saturn 3 , reclusive lover's Adam ( Kirk Douglas ) & Alex ( Farrah Fawcett ) . It seems that Adam & Alex are making slow progress with their work so Earth has sent the first of the Demigod series of robots lovingly named Hector to help assist them in their research & hopefully speed things up a bit . At first Hector is in pieces , but it doesn't take long for Benson to screw him together & for the fun to start . Hector has the ability to learn directly from Benson , Benson has a special device implanted into the back of his neck which leads to his brain & Hector is able to absorb Benson's thoughts & personality through this device , or something like that . Unfortunately since Benson is a liar , murderer & a mentally unstable drug user Hector starts to develop some worrying personality traits from him . Including an unhealthy obsession with Alex , eventually Hector goes completely berserk & decides that nothing or nobody will stop him from achieving his slightly distorted orders . To make matters even worse Saturn 3 has just entered a 22 day eclipse & cannot contact anyone until they come out of it . . . Saturn 3 is one of those films with a troubled production history , John Barry started the film as director but was either fired or left depending on who you believe & the films producer Stanley Donen took over & completed the filming . I quite liked Saturn 3 , it isn't brilliant but it wasted an hour and twenty minutes painlessly enough . The script by Martin Amis is not without it's problems , for most of the film there are only three human characters in it . Saturn 3 could have done with a few more disposable cast members for Hector to kill . Benson's motives are almost totally ignored , why kill Captain James & go to Saturn 3 anyway ? About two thirds of the way through Hector kills him before he says anything to suggest why is is there , some of Benson's other actions throughout the film were also a bit of a mystery to me . How could Benson pass himself off as Captain James so easily ? I was also confused about Hector's motives , what were his eventual plans for Saturn 3 , Adam , Alex & why ? Some of the dialogue is a little silly as well . The taking of drugs is mentioned but not tackled in a serious way as is the pollution of Earth . The ' Trivia ' section on the IMDb states that Saturn 3 only has music during the opening & closing credits , well I can tell you now that I watched it mere hours ago & although the music is used sparingly in Saturn 3 it is scored throughout by Elmer Bernstein . I would also like to mention the sound effects at this point as they really got on my nerves , every time something happened there was an annoying exaggerated electrical sound like when Hector walks or does something , when a door opens or shuts or just operating a computer . The part of Saturn 3 which stands out is the production design & sets which are very impressive , Saturn 3 obviously had a fair amount of money spent on it's overall look . The deranged robot , Hector , looks quite good even if it's head is rather stupid in appearance & it's obviously just a poor actor encased in a robotic suit . It's just a shame he didn't get to do more , preferably killing people . Some of the spacecraft in Saturn 3 look extremely silly , impractical & are obviously just plastic models . The special optical effects are OK , they're not great but they are just about acceptable without becoming too distracting . The acting isn't that great , Douglas looks a little bit old for the role , the best thing I can say about Fawcett is that she's pretty to look at & Keitel complete with pony-tail is dubbed throughout so his original performance is lost . There is a brief nude scene with Fawcett , forget about any gore or violence as all we get a severed hand , a dead dog & a novel use of a decapitated head . Saturn 3 is generally well made & has a reasonable polish to it , nothing stands out as being particularly brilliant but at the same time nothing stands out as being particularly bad . Overall I found Saturn 3 to be an OK way to spend 85 odd minutes , with a bit more thought in the script it could have been really good . As it is it's average at best , watch it if there's nothing else to do .
497217	1355507	113690	5.0	" I was born to murder the World . " Average & overlong horror .	Lord of Illusions starts with a paragraph of text that reads ' There are two worlds of magic . One is the glittering domain of the illusionist . The other is a secret place , where magic is a terrifying reality . Here , men have the power of demons . And death itself is an illusion . ' The film then cuts to the ' Mojave Desert 1982 ' where at an isolated house an evil magician named Nix ( Daniel von Bargen ) & his brainwashed cult of followers have sex , walk around naked , write messages in blood on the walls & generally behave in an anti-social way . Phillip Swann ( Kevin J . O'Connor ) , Casper Quaid ( Joseph Latimore ) , Jennifer Desiderio ( Sheila Tousey ) & Maureen Pimm ( Susan Taylor ) pull up outside , they enter the house fully armed with the intention of putting an end to Nix's evil ways & rescuing a young girl ( Ashley Cafagna-Tesoro as Ashley Lyn Cafagna ) whom he has taken hostage . They all think they put an end to Nix when Swann screws a metal mask onto his face , they then bury him deep in the desert . A rainy ' New York 13 Years Later ' where private detective Harry D'Amour ( Scott Bakula ) is given a insurance fraud job by a friend named Loomis ( Wayne Grace ) which involves tracking a man named Tapert ( Johnny Venocur as Johnny Venokur ) down in Los Angeles . While following Tapert D'Amour discovers Casper Quaid dying having been cut up by one of Nix's cult members Butterfeild ( Barry Del Sherman ) , D'Amour quickly becomes involved in his death & is hired by Dorothea Swann ( Famke Janssen ) the wife of Phillip who is now apparently the best illusionist in the world . Dorothea knew that Phillip & Quaid have connections & fears that Phillip may be next on the killers hit-list . What D'Amour finds is a trail of lies , deceit , murder & the possible resurrection of the evil Nix . . . Written , co-produced & directed Clive Barker I thought Lord of Illusions was an OK film , nothing more . I should point out at this time that the version I am reviewing is the longer ' director's cut ' released on DVD so bear that in mind , there are also some extra ' deleted scenes ' on the DVD which are short & offer nothing in the way of additional story development . The script by Barker based on his novel ' The Last Illusion ' tries to mix horror , mystery & the private detective genre with little success . Put quite simply there wasn't enough of a mystery element for me , I found the story extremely uninvolving & dull to watch . In fact Lord of Illusions totally ditches the detective story well before the end & goes into straight horror mode as Nix comes back from the grave for a standard ' hero kills bad guy & gets the pretty girl ' ending , very disappointing as there is no twist or anything that I really didn't see coming . I never really cared for any of the characters & the silly plot devices Barker employs to further the already ridiculous premise stretch Lord of Illusions credibility to breaking point as Barker treats the material with deadly seriousness . On a positive side Lord of Illusions looks great with it's cinematography & use of colour showing how Barker has developed since his debut , the infinitely superior Hellraiser ( 1987 ) . Tecnically Lord of Illusions is great apart from a couple of the optical effects which don't impress . Barker also continues his love affair with religious symbolism & bondage imagery , I mean just check that metal spiked mask out . There are one or two decent gore scenes but don't expect another Hellraiser , someone is impaled with swords , gunshot wounds splattering blood everywhere , nails being screwed into peoples heads , dead animals , stabbings with scalpels & peoples skin coming off their faces . The acting is OK but I thought Bakula was miscast & didn't feel right for the role , Janssen is still a babe & easy on the eyes . Overall I thought Lord of Illusions was an OK horror film which for the most part unsuccessfully tries to blend various genres , it's a bit different if not exactly gripping in the way I'm sure Barker had intended & it has it's moments but at the end of the day it provides little entertainment , nothing in the way of surprises & you will have forgotten about it within a week . Average at best , but still worth watching if your desperate .
497616	1355507	114367	5.0	" Are you coming . . . or are you just breathing hard ? " Average sci-fi / horror .	Screamers is set on the war ravaged mining planet of Sirius 6B during the year 2078 , a group of rebellious miners who call themselves the ' Alliance ' revolted against their company N . E . B . or the New Economic Block when it was discovered that the revolutionary fuel they were mining for them called Berynium produced lethal amounts of radioactive gas & as a result a long 10 year war between the two has raged . Joe Hendricksson ( Peter Weller ) is the commander of the Alliance when one day a lone N . E . B . soldier ( Sylvain Masse ) hand delivers a plea for peace & to set up a meeting . Soon after a N . E . B . spacecraft crashes near the Alliance's headquarter's which contained soldiers & weapons on their way to another planet rich in Berynium , the N . E . B . were going to leave everyone else on Sirius 6B to rot as a new source of Berynium has been found . Hendricksson decides to head to the N . E . B . base & discuss terms with whoever is left & takes the one & only survivor from the crash Jefferson ( Andrew Lauer ) along with him . Once there they discover almost everyone slaughtered & the few survivors talking of killer robots left over from the war known as Screamers that have evolved to mimic a human being perfectly , trusting anyone suddenly becomes very difficult . . . This Canadian , American & Japanese co-production was directed by Christian Duguay & is an average sci-fi horror at best . The script by Dan O'Bannon & Miguel Tejada-Flores was based on the short story ' Second Variety ' by Philip K . Dick & to be honest it feels like it as there just wasn't enough of a story here to maintain my interest . For a start Screamers is far too slow , after a promising opening scene things settle down & plod along for the next 90 odd minutes & I just found it very difficult to get excited about anything in Screamers . Don't get me wrong as I don't think it's not without some merit but I thought it was pretty forgettable stuff . The character's are clichéd , the situations they find themselves in are & various other films have more than a passing influence on Screamers like The Thing ( 1982 ) & the mistrust of each other , lots of soldiers with guns in futuristic settings reminds of Aliens ( 1986 ) & robotic killing machines mimicking people was done decades earlier ( & better ) in The Terminator ( 1984 ) . There is also a fair bit of political nonsense & a slightly over complicated war that seemed a bit too complex . Director Duguay does a pretty good job , some of the snow covered , post apocalyptic wasteland landscapes give Screamers a nice atmosphere & feel to it with some really good matte painting as well . The action scenes are flat & not very exciting unfortunately , just imagine lots of people running around in dark corridors . Screamers could have done with some decent action scenes , the opening sequence of the N . E . B . soldier being sliced ' n ' diced by a Screamer is as good as it gets . There is also a disappointing lack of gore , a few severed limbs & some splashes of blood is as good as it gets . With a supposed budget of about $20 , 000 , 000 I have to admit that I would liked to have seen more on screen , there are no big name actors , no big action scenes , limited special effects , limited locations & a few run down factory locations . As a whole 20 big ones seems like a lot of money considering the end product . The acting was OK but no one will remember Weller for anything other than Robocop ( 1987 ) will they ? Screamers is an OK film , it's generally well made with that Hollywood polish to it but I found it rather forgettable , a bit dull & lacklustre . Don't expect an all guns blazing sci-fi shoot-'em-up because Screamers isn't it , watch Aliens again instead as it's far superior in every way .
496935	1355507	338145	6.0	" Put out their eyes & never let them work again in the movie industry . " Reasonable ' Making-of ' .	It's Only a Movie : The Making of ' Last House on the Left ' runs just under 30 minutes & is a reasonable if slight collection of short interview clips with some of the cast & crew , in fact it sometimes feels more like a reunion than a informative documentary . Behind the camera is represented by editor , writer & director Wes Craven , producer Sean S . Cunningham & gopher Steve Miner . In front of the camera participant's are Lucy Grantham , David Hess , Fred Lincoln , Martin Kove & Marc Sheffler . The documentary is presented in a linear way starting with The Last House on the Left's origins & how the film was originally funded by a group of Boston drive-in owners who financed their own second features of a double bill & that's how The Last on the Left was financed . Then it goes into the casting like Martin Kove was originally going to be the main villain Krug but Kove wanted to be the comic relief & suggested his friend David Hess . The interviewees then discuss the filming which took 4 weeks & that it was shot in Westport , Connecticut at Cunningham's house & surrounding land . Then the subject of the films marketing arises with the revelation that it was shot under the title ' Night of Vengeance ' which was then dropped & changed to ' Krug & Co . ' & ' Sex Crime of the Century ' both of which did nothing at the box-office until someone suggested the title The Last House on the Left to Cunningham who gave it a try & never looked back I suppose . There are a few decent anecdotes in here but for the most part I found it largely uninformative & lightweight but since it's a free extra on a DVD I can't really complain & it features a few behind the scenes photos & a little bit of footage for the fans . It's the sort of documentary that is a back patting ' didn't he do well ' type appreciation piece . You will watch it once & then completely forget about it within a week or so , It's Only a Move : The Making of ' Last House on the Left ' is an OK time waster & the only real interest was in seeing what everyone looks like now .

Stallone on the Edge : The Making of Cliffhanger is a 20 minute documentary found on the American special edition DVD of the rather fabulous action flick Cliffhanger ( 1993 ) & is one that was made to promote the film around the time of it's original release , in fact Stallone is interviewed in it wearing his costume from Demolition Man ( 1993 ) . This is made up almost entirely of sound-bites & clips from on the set itself , lots of people repeatedly say how high they are & how dangerous it is . Stallone comes across alright in this , director Harlin comes across as stiff & most of it is shameless back patting self promotion . There are some neat behind the scenes segments although there isn't much information on the actual making of it , nothing on the effects or the story & little on the actors . You know the sort of thing it's just some on the set footage mixed with some of the best actions scenes from the finished film itself . Stallone on the Edge : The Making of Cliffhanger is an OK way to pass 20 minutes but don't expect to learn much about the making of it , this is self promotion all the way with a few nice behind the scenes moments . Worth watching if your a fan of the film , like me .

' s Captain Sam Cage ( Clayton Rohner ) & Major Callie O'Grady ( Chase Masterson ) dispatched to a military base in the Antartic named Arebus , officially a research facility but in reality an illegal mining base . Their brief is that Arebus has a crew of six & one of them has gone ' postal ' , it's their job to sort things out . A helicopter drops them in & they quickly find Major Frank Whittaker ( Stephen Hart ) frozen solid in the snow outside the base , upon entering the base they find medical officer Dr . Jennifer Wills ( Faith Ford ) & technician Lieutenant Brian Shebanski ( Max Perlich ) who show them the frozen body of Lieutenant Baines ( Douglas Stoup ) & say that the remaining two members of the crew , Captain Robert Reynolds ( Michael Stadvec ) & Dr . Carl Schilling ( Damian Chapa ) are somewhere outside in the tunnels they have mined . The mystery deepens as Baines body disappears & the radio is trashed , could the puzzling events be connected to something Dr . Schilling discovered in the icy tunnels below the Antartic surface . . . Directed by Daniel Zelik Berk I thought Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More was an OK way to pass the time but ultimately disappointed . The script by Adam Grossman & Darryl Sollerh starts off really well as everything is kept as mysterious as possible , the film gradually unravels into a weak climax involving Brothers who are 1000's of years old & the resurrection of Satan which is all rather silly & doesn't sit that well with what has gone before . The character's are pretty good , the dialogue is fine , it moves along at a fair pace & the basic story manages to do a decent job of both gripping & engaging the viewer . The film obviously reminds of The Thing ( 1982 ) although that's where the comparisons stop . It kept me watching throughout but I couldn't help but think that the climax isn't worth watching the first 90 minutes for which is a shame as I thought the set-up was well executed & deserved better . One more thing , I don't think the U . S . military would send just two soldiers ( no medic either ? ) out for a rescue mission in horrendous weather & just leave them there with no radio contact except what was available at Arebus ( what if it was broken ? ) , I don't think so . . . Director Berk does an OK job here & there is some decent atmosphere & tension . The Antartic is a great place to set a horror film & makes for a harsh , cold , desolate , unforgiving & isolated location . I don't know why more horror films aren't set in either Pole , perhaps it's the technical problems associated with filming in the conditions . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any but the film relies more on atmosphere & story for it's effectiveness . With a budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More is technically a very solid film , it's far from spectacular but since it was actually shot in Antartica , according to the IMDb , it has a definite chilly feel throughout . The acting was pretty good although I wasn't to impressed with leading man Rohner . Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More started well & showed promise but it's almost as if the filmmakers didn't know where to go with the set-up & it all ends rather lamely with a weak climax . Worth a watch but don't expect a masterpiece . The third in the Sometimes They Come Back . . . series of films this has no connection with the previous two & in fact is also known as Frozen & Ice Station Erebus & I wonder whether this was even conceived as a sequel or a stand alone film ?
499057	1355507	109415	6.0	" What ya gonna do ? Preach me to death ? " Not as good as the first two . . .	Children of the Corn III starts in the small American farming town of Gatlin where Joshua ( Ron Melendez ) runs from his drunk & abusive Father , Joshua runs into his younger adopted Brother Eli ( Daniel Cerny ) who promptly turns his stepfather in a scarecrow with a little help from a field of corn & ' he who walks behind the rows ' . . . With their Father suddenly disappearing Joshua & Eli are sent to the big city of Chicago & placed with foster parents William ( Jim Metzler ) & his wife Amanda Porter ( Nancy Grahn ) . While Joshua seems like a nice lad Eli is a bit of a freak , he won't change his old fashioned clothes , his suitcase is full of corn & at school he begins to brainwash his fellow pupils into joining his religious cult who worship ' he he walks behind the rows ' , as there aren't many corn fields in Chicago Eli grows one in an abandoned factory near his home . However Eli isn't growing any old corn , no he is growing super strong corn & super tasty corn but this corn comes at a price as once you eat it your body magically fills with cockroaches who then exit through your mouth . Eli convinces William to use his contacts at work & sell the corn worldwide & thus commencing his evil plan for world destruction ! Directed by James D . R . Hickox this is the third entry in the Children of the Corn series of films that now numbers seven including this , out of those seven films I have personally seen the first three & I thought Children of the Corn III was inferior to the previous two instalments . The script by Dode B . Levenson is based on the story by Stephen King but I would imagine in name only . In my opinion the big mistake it makes is transferring the basic plot of the first two films & sticking it in a modern urban setting , in the small community of Gatlin the premise worked , was effective & plausible in context . However shifting the action to Chicago things seem out of place , I can't for the life of me see a freaky kid like Eli being able to convince what seems like the entire high school into joining him & his cult , I mean these are guys with serious attitudes who would hit you as soon as look at you or pull a butterfly knife out on you if you even looked at them in the wrong way . I found it all rather difficult to swallow & then there's magical corn this time that kills you if you eat it , fireball fights , killings , there's even more confused religious nonsense & a book that seems nothing more than a convenient way to end the film . It's a bit of a mess although having said that it's fairly watchable if you like the horror genre , it moves along at a fair pace , is never too boring & it has a few nice deaths especially towards the end when it picks up for a action & special effect packed climax . Director Hickox does an OK job , there's a few decent scenes here & some gore , various corn related deaths occur as the corn leaves come to life & rip people's heads off , poke their eyes out & generally mistreat them , someone falls over & is impaled on a pipe , various people spew up cockroaches , someone has their face burnt off & there's a massacre at the end with some gory deaths by scythe & more corn leaves . Technically Children of the Corn III is pretty sound , it's competent & generally well made except for the variable special effects & in particular the absolutely awful looking monster at the end which is one of the worst I've seen in a long time & brings back memories of terrible rubber monsters from the 50's & 60's as this one really doesn't look any better . Some of the optical effects are also best described as poor . The acting isn't up to much to be honest , apparently this was Hollywood superstar Charlize Theron's first film appearance in an uncredited role which must have been small , I don't think she boasts about it . Children of the Corn III didn't really work for me , it's watchable , has some decent horror scenes but at the end of the day placing the action in Chicago was a mistake . At the time of my writing this comment Children of the Corn III is languishing on the IMDb's bottom 100 films list , while those who have a fondness for horror may like it & tolerate it's shortcomings other's should note it's on that list for a reason .
497410	1355507	435617	6.0	" This thing is bulletproof ! " I actually though it was a decent watch .	Chupacabra Terror , or Chupacabra : Dark Seas as it's also known , starts as a cryptozoologist ( someone who searches for mythical creatures ) named Dr Pena ( Giancarlo Esposito ) & his bunch of hired South American mercenaries are on the hunt for a Latin American creature known as a Chupacabra , they set traps which capture the Chupacabra & Dr . Pena manages to bring it under control with a dose of special tranquiliser . The cruise ship the ' Venician Queen ' is about to set sail as Captain Randolp ( John Rhys-Davis ) introduces himself to U . S . Marshall Lance ( Dylan Neal ) who has been brought aboard to try & unmask a thief . Dr . Pena also boards at this point with a suspicious looking wooden crate , the crate goes into storage & the Venician Queen sets sail . Two of the ships crew become curious as to what is in the crate & decide to open it , which in retrospect turned out to be a bad idea as the vicious Chupacabra jumps out brutally kills them both . It's not long before the mutilated bodies are found & Captain Randolph alerted , he tries to recapture the creature but as the body count grows Randolph has no choice but to call in the Navy Seals headed up by Commander Link ( Matthew R . Anderson ) but will it be enough to prevent the Chupacabra from slaughtering the entire ship . . . ? Co-written & directed by John Shepphird I actually thought Chupacabra Terror was a fairly entertaining ' creature feature ' type film . The script by Shepphird & Steve Jankowski ( who has a small role in the film as Admiral Williams ) moves along at a fair pace & at least it knows what it is & doesn't really try to be anything else other than a slimy monster-on-the-loose sci-fi / horror film . The character's aren't great , neither is the dialogue but it helps when there aren't huge chunks of time wasting exposition & unnecessary character development to pad the running time out , thankfully Chupacabra Terror sticks to the monster killing people which in itself wasn't a bad decision on behalf of the filmmakers since they obviously knew they weren't making high drama or an Oscar worthy epic . Chupacabra Terror reminded me of Deep Rising ( 1998 ) which itself was basically Titanic ( 1997 ) crossed with Aliens ( 1986 ) & while Chupacabra Terror definitely doesn't have the scope , scale or excitement of those films it's not a bad watch & is better than a lot of these Sci-Fi Channel films that I've sat through , I will take this opportunity to remind you of the cinematic masterpiece that is Python ( 2000 ) , now look me in the eye & say Chupacabra Terror is a bad film . Director Shepphird does an OK job , it doesn't have much visual flair or style but it looks alright considering it's straight-to-video origins . I really liked the monster in this , sure it's just a guy in a rubber monster suit but I liked it & though it looked pretty good most of the time . Also I'm pretty sure throwing grenades around a ships engine room would cause more damage than is suggested . There is a fair amount of blood & gore here , while not particularly graphic there is plenty of bloodshed , there are various ripped throats , mutilated bodies , dog munching & a bit where someone is chopped in half & their intestines are splattered are all over the place . With a budget of about $1 , 200 , 000 , filmed in the Turks & Caicos Islands Chupacabra Terror technically is a decent film , some of the special effects aren't the best but none are that bad , it can't really escape it's low budget made-for-video origins but it's certainly watchable . The acting is average , hey I'm trying to be kind here . While it's not going to win any awards for artistic merit or originality I thought Chupacabra Terror was a good , fun & entertaining monster film but going by some of the other comments here on the IMDb I think I'm in the minority with that opinion . Personally I think it's worth a watch & who cares what other people think anyway . . .
498870	1355507	87051	6.0	Decent Hammer House of Horror episode .	Hammer House of Horror : Children of the Full Moon starts as married couple Tom ( Christopher Cazenove ) & Sarah Martin ( Celia Gregory ) are driving down to Tom's bosses cottage deep in the English countryside , however en-route their car breaks down . They have no choice but to get out & walk , they come across a dirt track which leads to a large house where they are invited to stay the night by Mrs . Ardoy ( Diana Dors ) . At first things seem nice but the large amount of children unnerves them as does the howling outside & when Tom is attacked by a mysterious creature they come to the conclusion something sinister might be going on . . . Children of the Full Moon was episode 8 from this unfairly short lived British horror anthology TV series produced by Hammer studios , this originally aired during November 1980 here in the UK & was the second of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Tom Clegg ( along with The House that Bled to Death ) & is far from the series finest 50 odd minutes but I still thought it was alright none the less . The script by Murray Smith starts off at a cracking pace & feels like classic Gothic Hammer horror as a couple break down on a isolated country road & end up in a spooky English mansion that hides a shocking secret & are invited to stay the night but about half way through it changes direction & tone significantly as the story revolves around the supposed mystery of whether Sarah is a Werewolf or not & whether Tom dreamt the whole incident but to be honest it doesn't take a genius to work it out . The short 50 odd minute duration helps keep things moving along & it entertains to an extent but it's just that compared to other's in this series it's not that great , it's worth a watch but nothing particularly special . The low TV budget doesn't help things here , luckily the experience in making feature films probably helped the boys at Hammer turn in a surprisingly cinematic looking show obviously shot on 35mm film & if you keep an eye out during the series you will notice the same locations & props crop up on a regular basis . The locations are nice enough & it's generally well made except for the Werewolf masks which are OK I suppose but not that great an effect . There's not much gore here except a lamb with it's throat bitten out & some blood splatter on an axe . The acting is OK & I love the accents including Diana Dors who made this towards the back end of her career & didn't deserve the ' English Marilyn Monroe ' tag anymore when she appeared in this . Children of the Full Moon is a decent way to spend 50 odd minutes especially if your a horror fan or have an interest in Hammer studios , for me I liked it for sure but considering the other surprisingly excellent episodes in this series Children of the Full Moon pales a bit in comparison .
498104	1355507	113845	6.0	Not too bad but not brilliant .	Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching , subway decoy squad cop Charlie ( Woody Harrelson ) owes $15 , 000 of gambling debts to Mr . Brown ( Scott Sowers ) a very unpleasant mobster . Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him , Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John ( Wesley Snipes ) gives him the $15 , 000 but Charlie loses it . If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson ( Robert Blake ) , out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue . . . Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was . The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job ( 1969 ) or The First Great Train Robbery ( 1979 ) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller , the signs are there for all to see . The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags , the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's , there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down . There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many ' F ' swear words in as possible , the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed , Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe . A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal , starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here . Having said that I quite liked it , I did think certain parts of it were amusing , some of the one-liners & dialogue worked , there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out . The character's are a mixed bag , Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place , it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson , then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing , they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage . Director Ruben does alright , I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business . There's not much action until the end , a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though . The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model . The pace is uneven , until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story . With a supposed budget of about $68 , 000 , 000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures , the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story ( 1995 ) , Goldeneye ( 1995 ) & Ace Ventura : When Nature Calls ( 1995 ) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million . Ouch . The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much . Money Train was a disaster at the box-office , it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it , it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun . Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free .
498728	1355507	94597	6.0	" If you value your life I suggest you leave me alone . " I thought it was OK .	976-Evil starts with a dodgy game of cards where Leonard Johnson whose nickname is Spike ( Patrick O'Bryan ) loses his Harley to local thug Marcus ( J . J . Cohen ) & his gang , Spike refuses to hand his bike over & says he will have the monetary equivalent tomorrow . Back home Spike finds an advertisement for something called a ' Horrorscope ' which you have to phone 976 Evil to hear your horoscope , Spike decides to give it a go & the resultant advice turns out to be the solution to him keeping his Harley . Spike is hooked but as he continues to phone the number the messages become more menacing , meanwhile Spikes nerdy cousin Hoax ( Stephen Geoffreys ) finds the card & also decides to phone the number which results in advice about how to pick a good looking bird up . Much to Hoax's surprise it works a treat but thug Marcus & his gang show up & ruins things , after this somewhat embarrassing & humiliating experience Hoax continues to phone the number but receives advice on Satanic rituals & the more Hoax calls 976 Evil the gates of hell begin to open in Hoax's house & he becomes possessed by evil forces which turn him into a brutal Demonic killer . . . Directed by Robert Englund I personally thought 976-Evil was a decent time waster & a pretty watchable horror film . The script by Brian Helgeland & Rhet Topham moves along at a fair pace although it does drag in a couple of places & it does take itself a little seriously at times although to it's credit it is something a bit different , I mean it doesn't always work brilliantly but at least I didn't sit there thinking I'd seen it all before already like so many horror films & I wasn't bored either . Most of the character's are actually quite likable & well fleshed out except Hoax's mum Lucy ( Sandy Dennis ) who is awful as an overbearing religious fanatic . The story itself is fairly engaging & entertaining although it perhaps could have done more with the basic premise than it did & two early death scenes seem so unconnected & come & go so quickly they could almost be from another film . 976-Evil isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's better than a lot of horror films out there & it has a certain something about it that manages to distinguish it from the crowd . Director Englund is far better known to horror film audiences the world over as the child murderer Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) & it's numerous subsequent sequels . 976-Evil was Englund's first theatrical feature & after a bit of a battering from the critics he has only just completed his second directorial effort Killer Pad ( 2007 ) which is currently in post-production . He does a more than acceptable job actually despite not being able to resist those Freddy Krueger inspired one-liners & puns towards the end ( although there is a cool one involving a game of cards & two ripped out hearts ) , the film is pretty stylish , well made & uses lots of neon lighting to give it a distinctive look & feel . Generally speaking it's low on proper scares but it has that 80's horror film vibe about it , there's also some decent gore . Someone has their hand cut off with a knife , there is a scene of a couple of cats feeding on someone's intestine's , there are ripped out hearts , slashed faces , spurting blood , someone is impaled on a neon lit sign ( more neon ? ) & people burnt alive . Technically 976-Evil is surprisingly good , the special effects are fine , the cinematography & lighting is cool & it's well made throughout . The acting is also pretty good , except the terrible Sandy Dennis & her almost as terrible hair-dos . 976-Evil isn't the greatest film ever made but it's a decent effort that I enjoyed watching , it won't be the best horror film you've ever watched but I doubt it'll be the worst either . Personally I think it's well worth a watch if you can find a copy going cheap somewhere or catch it on late-night cable TV . It spawned the sequel 976-Evil 2 : The Astral Factor ( 1991 ) which I will be watching & reviewing within the next week or so . . .
497078	1355507	257516	6.0	I thought it was pretty fun .	Cursed is set in Los Angeles & starts on a road in the hills as brother & sister Ellen ( Christina Ricci ) & Jimmy Meyers ( Jesse Eisenberg ) are driving along & hit some sort of animal on the road which causes them to crash into another car which in turn ends up off the road . While trying to help the driver ( Shannon Elizabeth ) they are attacked by & Werewolf who kills the woman & scratches both Ellen & Jimmy . The authorities put the incident down to some mountain tiger or bear attack , case closed . However strange things start to happen to both Ellen & Jimmy who undergo odd changes , they both have the ' mark of the beast ' on their palms , they are warned by psychic's , they develop heightened senses & immense strength & they develop a taste for raw meat as they succumb to the curse of the Werewolf . . . This American German co-production was directed by Wes Craven & is a fairly fun light hearted teen horror that I admit I quite liked . Cursed underwent a very troubled production , while being filmed in early 2003 the production company Miramax pulled the plug after not liking what they were seeing . The script was almost totally rewritten & subsequently shot during late 2003 at which time several of the principal cast were unavailable to complete filming so entire character's & sequences were cut , rewritten & re-shot . It is then perhaps somewhat surprising that the script by producer Kevin Williamson is as coherent & enjoyable as it is , it certainly isn't any sort of masterpiece but it is fairly likable forgettable fun that I enjoyed . Maybe more than I should have but I did enjoy it , so sue me . I would say Cursed is a sort of mix between The Lost Boys ( 1987 ) with it's youth culture & character's & An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) with people attacked by a Werewolf who then find themselves turning into Lycanthropes & waking up naked in public . There's a fair amount of personal drama & angst as a fair amount of the script focuses on the two main leads coping with finding out they are Werewolves & the impact that has on their lives although there are a few decent Werewolf scenes & a reasonable climax which is maybe a little too predictable but at least the makers tried to stick a twist in there . Director Craven has had better days , from classic pioneering horror like The Last House on the Left ( 1972 ) , The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 ) , A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) , The People Under the Stairs ( 1991 ) & Scream ( 1996 ) to the likes of Vampire in Brooklyn ( 1995 ) & this . Cursed is not the sort of film that you would associate with a master of the genre , maybe Craven just got lucky on a few occasions & he was never that good a director to begin with ? There's nothing scary here , it's very glossy , over-lit & very much a safe product of a Hollywood studio but I still liked it all the same . Available in both PG & Unrated versions the Unrated cut is obviously the way to go with some alright blood & gore scenes . You know the incredible Werewolf transformation scene by Rick Baker from An American Werewolf in London is now almost thirty years old yet in today's CGI computer effect driven film industry nothing has even come anywhere near it in terms of impact or realism which for me says everything about horror these days . The CGI Werewolf transformation in Cursed looks terrible , it's probably the single worst moment of the entire film & is unintentionally funny when it should have been the best & most dramatic moment like it was in An American Werewolf in London . With a supposed budget of about $35 , 000 , 000 Cursed is well made with good polished production values . The acting is alright , I liked Ricci in this & thought she put in a reasonable performance & had a nice look about her too . Genre icons Robert Forster , Corey Feldman & Heather Langencamp filmed scenes for Cursed during the initial shoot but weren't involved in the re-shoots & all of their scenes ended up on the cutting room floor & unused . Cursed is a film with a bad reputation but I couldn't help but quite like it , I'm not really sure why but I just did . It moves along at a good pace , there's some gore , there's Werewolves , there's some fun performances & some amusing scenes . It's not perfect that's for sure but I didn't think it was all that bad & it's as simple & straight forward as that .

E . : Deadly Protection starts as a young girl named Emily Stapleton ( Kristin Gamboa ) is happily playing in her yard when the family's new German Shephard guard dog named Samson goes crazy & attacks her , L . A . county coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is deeply upset & moved at having to perform an autopsy on her . Quincy speaks with Emily's father Jay ( Sam Groom ) & promises him he will look into the regulations surrounding the training & selling of guard dogs before anymore innocent lives are lost to killer dogs , as he digs deeper Quincy discovers a virtually unregulated business & he uses his influence to try & warn the general public of the dangers . . . Episode 23 from season 7 ( the IMDb is wrong because it also states that Expert in Murder aired on / 82 yet lists it as episode 20 from season 6 , a season which aired in 1980 & 1981 , when it was in fact episode 20 from season 7 & Deadly Protection actually aired on / 82 which makes it episode 23 from season 7 , got that ? Good ) this Quincy story was directed by Paul Krasny & is yet another diverse story from this very adaptable & varied series , it's not the best Quincy episode ever but it's still a decent watch & a perfectly entertaining way to pass an hour . Disappointingly there isn't much of a crime here for Quincy to solve for mot of it's duration & when one does finally arise it's painfully obvious what's going on , the issue it tackles though is still very relevant & I can recall several high profile attacks here in the UK on children by vicious dogs which have left them either dead or horribly scarred although as far as I remember they were from family pets as opposed to guard dogs . It's not a pleasant subject to be honest & I didn't think it made the basis for a particularly good story , it's Quincy & I like the show even when it's not as good as usual but other's may not have the same tolerance levels . There's a cheesy comedy gag running through Deadly Protection as Quincy adopts a cute little doggy from the pound & has to hide it from his boss Asten ( John S . Ragin ) whom the dog keeps peeing on , very funny if you like that sort of thing . The acting is alright here but Sam Groom as the father who has lost his only daughter doesn't convince . Deadly Protection isn't the best Quincy episode , it focuses too much on it's moral issue & for the most part leaves Quincy on the sidelines which is never a good idea , it's a perfectly watchable story but there are better ones out there .
497387	1355507	681774	6.0	Decent Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Diplomatic Immunity starts as Armando Sarejo ( Rudy Solari ) the President of a small Latin American country is awaiting a life saving liver operation in Los Angeles , together with his wife Isabella ( Ana Navarro ) & the people closest to him Sarejo waits for his operation . With security guards everywhere the much hated dictatorial President is supposedly safe , then Marcos ( Ivan Saric ) his Vice President dies suddenly of a heart attack . State department man Allen Stewart ( George Wyner ) requests LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) perform the autopsy , initial finds suggest Marcos died of a heart attack but it wasn't a natural death . With murder confirmed officials are convinced that Sarejo was the target & have a race against time to discover the would be assassin with Quincy using his medical skills to try & get to the truth . . . Episode 13 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is a pretty good murder mystery themed story but it's not up there with the very best & I wouldn't call it classic Quincy . The script revolves around the potential assassination of the brutal President of a Latin American country which is fine & a good solid base but there are things which didn't really add up for me . I mean if you were trying to kill Sarejo why kill anyone else ? I know killing the Vice President as well would leave power up for grabs ( just killing the President would mean the Vice President would automatically become President ) but it's not really made that clear in a sloppy script . Surely the murder of someone close to the President would merely have raised suspicions & ultimately tightened security & made it even more difficult to carry out your intended assassination ? It's not even made clear who killed the Vice President , was it the Doctor who intended to kill the President & if it was why ? Was it the fake Hospital orderly ? Again if so why ? Why not just kill Sarejo to start off with ? The person who is responsible for those two death's is never made totally clear , the death's occur off screen so we , the audience that is , never actually find out the person behind the two murders or the reason behind at least one . Having said that Diplomatic Immunity is a decent murder mystery , it moves along at a good pace , there's no moral message to be found anywhere & most of the regular character's get a sizable role . Monahan gets to play detective & Asten gets to play pathologist as Quincy is tied up in a separate court case in a silly subplot which distances him from the main action although like the super coroner he is Quincy pretty much solves the case over the phone between the court & laboratory ! This one is well made as usual but remarkable , there's a tiny bit of action as a car speeds out of a Hospital car park & is shot at & a little bit of blood is seen . With a lot of the supporting character's from some unnamed Latin American country there are some seriously poor accents going on , some of the acting here is dire & some of the fake moustaches aren't that impressive either . The comedy ending sees Quincy sentenced to three days in prison for contempt of court which he has to serve on three consecutive Sunday's , surely he would have been in big trouble with his superiors for that & possibly even sacked ? Diplomatic Immunity is a decent if severely flawed murder mystery Quincy episode , it's not awful but it doesn't quite work either . Fans of the show should still like though as I did .
497993	1355507	681806	6.0	Solid if unspectacular Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Mode of Death starts as Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is called to a seedy cheap motel room where the body of evangelist & founder of the Devine World Church religion Franklin Osborne ( Byron Morrow ) has been found dead with a half empty bottle of Scotch Whiskey & a half empty bottle of pills found nearby . At first Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) suspects suicide , Quincy's autopsy proves inconclusive since the amount of alcohol & drugs in Osborne's system is marginal both ways & could have been a deliberate suicide or a simple accident . Quincy decides to delve further & orders a psychological autopsy to be carried out to find out Osborne's mental state & whether it was an accident , suicide or maybe even murder . . . Episode 7 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Rob Holcomb & is a good solid Quincy episode that entertains & is perfectly watchable although it's doesn't stay too long on the memory . The script was in part written by Jack Klugman's sister Deborah ( keeping it in the family . . . ) & starts off reasonably well with a dead body found in mysterious circumstances in a motel room that at first looks like a typical case for Quincy to get his investigative teeth stuck into but after about the ten minute mark the episode shifts rather suddenly into moralistic message mode as Quincy orders a psychological autopsy & we follow Dr . Chase around as he treads very carefully around Osborne's friends & family to try & decide if he committed suicide or not hence the title Mode of Death . During this period Quincy takes a back seat & he's barely in it , apart from a classic scene between him & Asten over money & who is paying for the psychological autopsy as Quincy waves a dollar bill in his bosses face . Then about five minutes before the end Quincy does what he should have in the first place & proves Osborne was murdered . There's a fair amount of preaching about suicide & those who are contemplating it , it's the usual ' they need help ' message with a bit of ' if they didn't need help then they wouldn't be trying to commit suicide ' thrown in there as well . At only fifty odd minutes the episode moves along at a decent pace , the murder mystery element is packed into the last five minutes with a fairly dull psychological autopsy subplot taking up much of the duration & overall it's watchable if ultimately a bit forgettable . As usual this episode is well made & competent but hardly going to win any awards for style . There's some nice humour like usual & the killer isn't too obvious . The acting is alright , as usual the regular's outshine the guest star's by a large margin . The guy who plays Kenneth Ross in particular is poor with a terrible accent & voice . Mode of Death isn't the best episode of Quincy out there but it's still perfectly watchable & entertaining , maybe the fact Quincy isn't in it that much doesn't help & there are other Quincy episodes I would rather watch over Mode of Death but even average Quincy is still better than most telly show's at their best .
499333	1355507	681849	6.0	Decent Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : The Eye of the Needle starts with Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his boss Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) attending a lecture about holistic medicine by Dr . Barri Stodder ( Frances Lee McCain ) who is a practitioner of the controversial technique . The next morning & Quincy is outraged to find that the body of Helen Burnett ( Sally Kemp ) has ended up on his autopsy table after an ulcer burst killing her , Quincy is shocked that the ulcer was in such an advanced & untreated state . After learning that Dr . Stodder treated Helen with naturalistic techniques rather than proved medical ones Quincy talks to her & becomes convinced that she was not responsible for the death , Quincy then has to investigate Helen's death further in order to find out what killed her before Dr . Stodder's holistic clinic is closed down for good . . . Episode 23 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & one can't help but notice & comment on the similarities between The Eye of the Needle & another Quincy episode from season four Death by Good Intentions since they are virtually the same in both plot & resolution . Like in Death by Good Intentions here Quincy has to go back & examine a case to uncover the truth in order to save a friends career which is put in jeopardy when one their patients die & they are blamed for it , Quincy uses his medical expertise to prove that they weren't responsible & that someone committed murder . It's actually quite striking how similar the two episodes are right down to an antagonistic fellow professional who wants to see the said Doctor in question ruined & an expensive lawsuit issued by the relatives of the deceased . So in essence they are pretty much the same & in that regard they are both perfectly entertaining episodes that have a moral message put to the viewer from both sides ( although it's made clear which side ' we ' should be on ) for the first half & more of a murder mystery during the second half as Quincy does what he does best . Not a bad episode at all . This is yet another unremarkable episode that is functional but not much to look at , the one thing that does stick out in The Eye of the Needle is that it must feature the tallest mugger in history ! The guy who plays the mugger is huge ! Just look at how long his legs are in full length shots . The Eye of the Needle is a perfectly entertaining episode of Quincy that mixes the usual moral messages & murder mysteries well enough , I liked it . It's not a classic episode but I liked it .
499090	1355507	681878	6.0	Decent Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Welcome to Paradise Palms starts as Los Angeles medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) gets a call from Roberta Wanaka ( Silvana Gallardo ) saying that her son & his foster son Chester ( Eddie Garcia ) is badly ill & ask's him for help . Quincy sets off for the town of Paradise Palms where Roberta & her son Chester lives nearby on a native Indian reservation , once there Quincy quickly diagnoses Chester with the bubonic plague , also known as the Black Death . Then more bubonic plague cases start being reported , with the grand opening of a new hotel & golf course Quincy & local doctor Paul Minnara ( Ronald Joseph ) face a race against time to find the source of the bubonic plague before the guests arrive & an epidemic occurs but local officials don't want any bad publicity & are very unhelpful . . . All the six's episode 6 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & one has to say that while it's alright it's nothing amazing & is a fairly standard ' race against time & bureaucracy ' type plot , considering it's set on or near a new golf course it's all rather par for the course . Welcome to Paradise Palms is one of those Quincy episodes which ditches the traditional & familiar Los Angeles laboratory setting & takes place almost entirely in the small town of Paradise Palms where Quincy's foster son Chester lives . After a potentially deadly outbreak of botulism in Deadly Arena ( 1980 ) from the end of season five here Quincy has a race against time to find the source of bubonic plague & prevent an epidemic & again much like Deadly Arena Quincy works with another doctor & they both come up against unhelpful officials who are only interested in money rather than public health . Instead of the football stadium in Deadly Arena it's a hotel here , instead of the football spectators who are in danger in Deadly Arena it's the hotel guest's here , instead of botulism in Deadly Arena it's bubonic plague here , instead of the little girl Pele in Deadly Arena it's the young boy Chester here & instead of the unhelpful stadium manager refusing to start a panic & seemingly only interested in money here it's the unhelpful hotel manager who has the same motivations . To be honest the whole episode feels very familiar & there really isn't anything new here although it is fun & passes fifty odd minutes harmlessly enough . This episode also has a stab at highlighting the exploitation of native Indians , their land & the evils of big business which is also rather unoriginal but at least it tries . As usual this episode is well made but unremarkable , I would have imagined the shooting schedule was tight & it was a pretty much ' point the camera in the right direction & shoot ' type policy on Quincy . The scenery is quite nice I suppose if nothing else . The acting is alright & there's a nice sentimental moment for Quincy as he speaks with his ill foster son Chester referring to why he never had children of his own . Welcome to Paradise Palms is a pretty good ' race against time & bureaucracy ' type Quincy episode although Deadly Arena is better , there's a moral & social message which gets in the way at times but overall this is well worth a watch especially if you like the show anyway .
498963	1355507	681859	6.0	Good Quincy episode without much Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : The Law is a Fool starts as Carl Norman ( Jeff Pomerantz ) kidnaps a young girl named Debbie Hillman by taking the place of her usual cab driver . A search gets underway & Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is brought in to help with any forensic evidence , however after a picture of Norman is broadcast on the news he turns himself in to the police . He won't tell anyone where Debbie is & demands to be tried for her kidnap , all of the D . A . ' s evidence is circumstantial & if he is acquitted the double jeopardy law comes into effect in which he cannot be tried for the same crime twice no matter what happens . Norman says that if he is acquitted he will tell them where Debbie is for a small half a million dollars & even if he does tell them therefore admitting to the crime he can't be tried for her kidnap because he'll have already been found not guilty . . . Episode 11 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & is a decent episode of Quincy even though he only gets about 5 minutes worth of screen time & is probably one of the few episodes where he doesn't perform an autopsy on anyone . Since this is the moral heavy season 8 there just has to be a social issue here & it comes down to believing in the law or whatever you place your faith in & sticking with it as it'll work out for the best in the end & won't let you down if you put the effort in , I mean they were always going to find a way to nail Norman weren't they ? The lack of any real Quincy related action does hurt this episode somewhat & I'd have liked to have seen Norman get away with it & his plan work which technically it should have but you can't have everything I suppose . The Law is a Fool is a perfectly entertaining way to pass 60 odd minutes although as usual it's rather predictable & has a bit too much moralising & not enough detective work . This one looks alright , lots of studio bound offices & prison cells you know the sort of thing . You know based on the evidence I don't think Norman would have been acquitted either , the fact that his were the only finger prints on the steering wheel , the cab drivers testimony , the lack of any other suspects , his connection to Debbie's Grandfather & the fact he didn't deny kidnapping her would have probably been enough for a majority verdict , what do you think ? The acting here is OK but nothing Oscar worthy . The Law is a Fool is an OK Quincy episode for sure , it's a fine way to pass an hour but Quincy's barely in it & he doesn't perform an autopsy either which just seems plain odd , a Quincy episode without much Quincy .
497132	1355507	365748	6.0	A good horror / comedy but somewhat overrated .	Shaun of the Dead is set in London where Shaun ( co-writer Simon Pegg ) has problems , his fat mate Ed ( Nick Frost ) is holding him back , his girlfriend Liz ( Kate Ashfield ) dumps him & then there's the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living . However , Shaun has a plan to save himself , his mate , his ex-girlfriend & his mum & step-dad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub . . . This British French co-production was co-written & directed by Edgar Wright & I have to say I was left a little disappointed by it & I can't quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from . The script by star Pegg & Wright is obviously a nice homage to George A . Romero's ' Dead ' films although to be honest I'd sooner watch Romero's splatter / gore films than this odd mixture of comedy , romance & horror . Shaun of the Dead is all very British & maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who don't live here in Britian , unfortunately I do live here & it just doesn't have quite the same affect on me . Apparently both Pegg & Wright were involved in the British comedy series ' Spaced ' which to be honest I've never heard of & maybe that's where a lot of it's fans come from . Anyway , it's a moderately successful film & certainly a watchable one , it's amusing , it's pretty clever & well written , it has plenty of fun references to other films , it's a fairly fun film but I found it to be too spoofy , it goes to far into the direction of silliness & some of the things that happen just annoyed me . I'm in two minds really , I will openly admit it's a fun watch but I didn't think it was as brilliant as many seem to think , I doubt I'd watch it again anytime soon & I didn't have as much fun with it as I'd hoped , overall I'd say I was a little disappointed . Director Wright does a good job , it's shot like a TV soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy , romance & horror quite well . It's not scary & I didn't find it laugh out loud funny either but I'm sure many of you out there do / will . I like the laddish approach that the modern British male would barricade themselves in a pub & wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush & sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . There's some gore , someone is torn apart at the end , there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioning . With a supposed budget of about $4 , 000 , 000 Shaun of the Dead is well made although there isn't a great deal of style or flair to it . The acting is good & the cast make their character's pretty likable . Shaun of the Dead is a decent fun homage to Romero's zombie films , to be brutally honest I'd rather see one of those again than this though . Worth a watch for sure but not as good as I'd hoped & I feel it's slightly overrated .
499123	1355507	95088	6.0	" I'm never working for that sleaze-ball again . . . I have to find another sleaze-ball . " Watchable comedy .	Elvira , Mistress of the Dark starts with cable TV horror show hostess Elvira ( Cassandra Peterson who also co-wrote ) having a run in with her new boss Earl Hooter ( Lee McLaughlin ) & getting herself fired . However Elvira doesn't care as she is about to star in her own show in Las Vegas , that is until her manager Manny ( Charles Woolf ) says she needs to raise $50 , 000 of the production costs herself . Elvira thinks she's screwed , that is until she learns that her great aunt Morgana has recently died & left her something in her will . Elvira senses money so heads for the small town of Fallwell in Massachusettes where Morgana lived . Once there Elvira discovers that she inherits Morgana's house , dog & cookbook . With no money Elvira decides to stick around & sell the house but the conservative locals think Elvira is immoral , cheap & bad for the town so lead by the righteous Chastity Pariah ( Edie McClurg ) they start a campaign to oust her from Fallwall . Meanwhile Elvira's evil Satan worshipping uncle Vincent ( William Morgan Sheppard ) is plotting to get his hands on Elvira's cookbook , which is in fact a book of powerful spells , by any means necessary . . . Directed by James Signorelli I thought Elvira , Mistress of the Dark was a decent watchable family comedy horror . I have to state straight away that I am perhaps at a disadvantage as here in the UK we have no exposure to the character Elvira unlike in the States where I think she gave introductions to horror films , right ? Anyway I'm not sure as we don't , & never had , have anything like that here & I have never seen the Elvira character in anything before this . The script by Sam Egan , John Paragon & Peterson is silly & really plays the comedy elements up , I'd have perhaps preferred the horror angle to come through a bit more , I mean wasn't she a horror film hostess ? Having said that it provides fair entertainment & a some mildly amusing moments here & there & at least it knows what it is & has no aspirations to be anything else other than a collection of puns , boob jokes , sexual innuendo & slapstick . As a whole Elvira , Mistress of the Dark works quite well with likable character's , just enough horror to maintain my interest & Elvira herself is pretty charismatic , very sexy in her skin tight low cut dress , high heels & I wouldn't mind her introducing my horror films . Look out for her Las Vegas show at the end where she twirls some tassel's attached to her breasts , even managing one at a time . Director Signorelli keeps things moving at a nice pace , the jokes & puns come thick & fast & it never becomes dull or boring . There is one effective jump scene that involves a slimy creature that feels like it belongs in a different film . Forget about any violence , someone has their hand cut off with an axe & Elvira throws her high heeled shoe at someone & the heel becomes impaled in their forehead ! I did think he overdid the sentimentality a little at the mushy feel good ending though . With a healthy budget of about $7 , 500 , 000 I must admit I'm not sure where all the money went , there are few special effects , no big name actors or huge action scenes . Anyway , it's well made & Elvira's spooky house , inside & out , looks cool which probably cost a few quid to make . The acting is OK & everyone comes across as likable enough , Elvira obviously steals the show with her outfits & attitude . Elvira , Mistress of the dark is a nice enough way to pass 95 odd minutes & offers a few amusing moments . A lot of the jokes feel dated & the overall story is weak but I still think it's worth a watch .
497128	1355507	59821	6.0	" Not ten minutes ago I tried to kill a stray cat with a cabbage . " Great to look at but lacking elsewhere .	The Tomb of Ligeia starts with the chance meeting of Lady Rowena ( Elizabeth Shepherd ) while out fox hunting & the recently widowed Verden Fell ( Vincent Price ) , she becomes interested in the mysterious Fell & despite him trying to strangle her once it's not long before wedding bells chime & the two are ' happily ' married . Verden lives in a large Abby with his previous wife Ligeia buried nearby but Verden doesn't believe she's dead , he is obsessed with his dead wife & neglects Rowena who to be fair to her has problems of her own as a sinister black cat keeps turning up & she starts to have nightmares & hallucinations which she believes may be the ghost of Ligeia haunting her . . . This British production was directed by Roger Corman The Tomb of Ligeia was the eighth & last of his Edgar Allan Poe adaptation's coming after The Masque of the Red Death ( 1964 ) & while I don't claim to have seen them all I would imagine that The Tomb of Ligeia is probably one of the lesser films of the eight . The script by Robert Towne is based on the story by Edgar Allan Poe which was apparently entirely narrated & had a significantly different ending so I would guess that this filmed adaptation bears little resemblance to the story bar the title & character's . It's rather ponderous & slow with very little happening within it's short 80 odd minute duration . I also felt the film was far too predictable , if there's anyone out there who can't guess the basic outcome of this I'd be pretty surprised . It's not particularly scary & as a whole I felt the story lacked a hook , it didn't engage or draw me in & a lot of it goes relatively unexplained like the stray cat which has something to do with it but Corman never explains what exactly . Director Corman does a great job here & it's the films rich visual style & appearance that saves it from being a complete dud . The Gothic spiderweb encrusted Abby sets are brilliant & provoke real atmosphere , the period production design is first class & this has to be one of the best looking horror films of the 60's . However seeing the character's run around these impressive sets not really doing much isn't actually that much fun I'm afraid although I would actually probably watch The Tomb of Ligeia again just for the cool sets . There's no blood or gore so don't worry about that & unfortunately it's not scary either . Technically The Tomb of Ligeia is top notch with wonderful production values , good special effects & it's very well made with nice attention to the period detail for the probably low budget . This was shot in England in Norfolk using the Castle Acre Priory & Stonehenge also gets a few scenes shot there . Vincent Price puts in his usual over-the-top performance minus any facial hair which makes him look really strange when your used to seeing him with a beard , everyone else puts in a decent shift . The Tomb of Ligeia looks great but the story just lacks punch & it didn't entice me into it at all , overall I'd say The Tomb of Ligeia was a disappointment although it's nice to look at . Worth a watch but just don't expect too much substance .
497527	1355507	82334	6.0	Surprisingly good supernatural shocker .	The Entity is set in California where single mother of three Carla Moran ( Barbara Hershey ) happily lives in a home with her teenage son Billy ( David Labiosa ) & her two young daughters Julie ( Natasha Ryan ) & Kim ( Melanie Gaffin ) . One night her cosy life is turned upside down when Carla is attacked & raped by some invisible force , she seeks help from psychologist Dr . Phil Sneiderman ( Ron Silver ) who tries to help Carla from the medical scientific viewpoint that she is imagining it all . However Carla is not imagining it & she is attacked & raped at least two more times before she decides that she has to turn to more unorthodox methods of two parapsychologists who think they can trap the violent entity & get it out of Carla's life for good . . . Directed by Sidney J . Furie this interesting often quite absorbing supernatural horror film turned out much better than I had expected . The script by Frank De Felitta was based on his own novel of the same name that was supposedly partially based upon a true story takes itself very seriously & set out to tell the somewhat grim story of a woman who is raped by a ghost & the effect this has on her & her family & friends . It's a very character driven story that has a lot of parallels to The Exorcist ( 1973 ) , the female central character who starts out happy & normal before evil supernatural occurrences begin to ruin her life , the contrast between character's who suspect a plausible scientific & medical explanation based in reality against those who believe a more supernatural explanation for the sinister goings-on to the general feel of the plot & story which moves in a very similar way to The Exorcist as it builds up to a big set-piece climax in which some sort of evil demonic spirit is fought . Having said that The Entity is still a good film & one that turned out better than I expected , it can be a bit slow at times but it is spent on purposeful character development which really helps draw you into the story & actually care about whats going on . The Entity is a good solid character driven supernatural horror film that won't suit all tastes since it's not flashy or gory or has any big name stars in it & it can be slow going at times but it's a fairly intense film that overall I liked . The first ninety odd minutes of The Entity is pretty low key with the bare minimum of special effects , set-pieces & ghostly goings-on while the final thirty odd minutes goes over the top with plenty of optical effects , laser beams , spirits , jets of hydrogen & even a collapsing house . Even though special make-up effect man Stan Winston gets a prominent ' special make-ups effect by ' at the end I didn't see any make-up effects at all in this . In fact I don't think there is a single drop of blood during it's entire two hour plus duration & nobody dies or gets murdered . The rape scenes are not graphic , since Carla is raped by an invisible force it's difficult to make these scenes graphic anyway . There's a couple of scenes where her nipple gets played around with & a scene featuring full frontal nudity on her part but to me it didn't look like a rape purely because there was no-one else there . Luckily Barbara Hershey puts in a really good & credible performance which brings some intensity to scenes which could have come across as ridiculous . Production wise the film is well made with competence & has good solid production values , you can definitely see that The Entity is a Hollywood film . The acting is alright , it goes from the excellent Barbara Hershey to the flat & dull Ron Silver who is probably the one weak link in the cast . The Entity is a good solid psychological horror thriller that is supposedly based on true events which I find difficult to believe but there you go . This turned out better than I had anticipated but it's a bit too long in places & I doubt I would ever want to see it again . The Hollywood remake predictably called The Entity ( 2010 ) is currently in development & you can bet anything you like if it ever gets made it will be loaded with CGI . . .
497423	1355507	430926	6.0	I thought it was OK , better than I had expected .	Bloodsuckers is set in the year 2210 where mankind has spread out into space , unfortunately most of space is occupied by various different breeds of blood sucking Vampires . That's where the likes of Captain Churchill ( Joe Lando ) & his crew come in , you see he leads a team of soldiers killing Vampires wherever they find them . A sort of intergalactic Vampire sanitation service if you can imagine such a thing . They relentlessly fight the good fight against alien Vampires for a crappy wage but at least they get job satisfaction . . . Retitled to Vampire Wars : Battle for the Universe when released on DVD this made-for-TV Canadian production was executive produced , written & directed by Matthew Hastings & I have to say I didn't think it was too bad , it certainly passed an hour & a half harmlessly enough if nothing else . The script mixes a bit of Aliens ( 1986 ) , a touch of Starship Troopers ( 1997 ) with a smidgen of John Carpenter's Vampires ( 1998 ) & adds a dash of Blade ( 1998 ) & starts of very brightly with a surprisingly gory & fast moving opening twenty odd minutes , unfortunately the film can't really sustain this & never recaptures the heights of this opening sequence . My overwhelming problem with Bloodsuckers is that there is a definite lack of story here , the film just goes from one sub plot to another & never really settles down into one consistent story . For instance it starts out with the Vampire hunters hunting down some Vampires & you think this will be the common theme throughout the film but no , then there's a rescue mission on a planet where they are almost overrun by Vampires but nothing long lasting becomes of it , the film then introduces a new kind of parasitic worm like Vampire & again I thought this is what the film is going to be about but again it quickly forgets about it & shifts onto yet another different race of Vampires & yet another different planet . The whole film feels very fragmented & disjointed as a result . The character's are awful clichés & a few of them are very annoying especially the ugly Chinese girl Rosa who thinks she's ' hard ' & is basically a Vasquez from Aliens rip-off only not as good . Director Hastings does alright , despite what people on the IMDb say I thought the special effects are surprisingly good with reasonably good looking CGI computer effects which aren't overused & I was pleased to see all the blood & gore effects were actually physical on set make-up effects . This has a pleasing amount of blood & gore , from bodies with legs ripped off , stakings , blood spurts , gory gunshot wounds , Vampire worms bursting out of people's chests & severed limbs Bloodsuckers is a pretty gory film & that's a good thing in my book . There are a few homages in here as well , in particular one set of Vampires are called Leatherfaces as in Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films while another race are know as the Voorhees which is obviously a nod to Jason Voorhees the zombie killer from the Friday the 13th films , or then again maybe it's just a coincidence ? With a modest budget of about $1 , 700 , 000 Bloodsuckers is well made , the futuristic sets are pretty good & as already mentioned the effects are more than satisfactory . Shot in British Colombia in Canada . The acting isn't good , the usually brilliant Michael Ironside is only in for about 10 minutes & he gives a terrible performance but he's no worse than anyone else & he's got every right to be pssed off if this is the sort of crap he's been reduced to . A special mention for Leanne Adachi as Rosa who not only gives an awful performance but makes her character so irritating & unlikable you want her to die , horribly ( the character that is , not the actress ! ) . Bloodsuckers is a better film than I had any right to expect , it's not perfect but as a one off watch to pass the time it's reasonably good , gory fast moving fun . It ' borrows ' heavily from other films but that gives it a certain familiarity .
497356	1355507	86154	6.0	Pretty good sequel to Hitchcock's classic .	Psycho II is set twenty two years after the events of the original Psycho ( 1960 ) & starts as Norman Bates ( Anthony Perkins ) is declared legally sane & released from the asylum . Norman heads back to his home town & his motel , while working in a roadside diner Norman meets & befriends young waitress Mary Samuels ( Meg Tilly ) . After Mary is dumped by her boyfriend Norman invites her to stay with him in his large house which she does . At first Norman seems fine & perfectly sane but he starts receiving phone-calls & hand written notes from his mother , his dead mother . Then when dead bodies start to turn up it seems Norman may be up to his old tricks . . . Directed by Richard Franklin this sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's classic original is actually a pretty good psychological thriller with a hint of teen slasher film thrown in there for the 80's crowd's . Hitchcock made the original Psycho in 1960 & I guess no-one wanted to make a sequel while the great man was still around so when Hitchcock died in 1980 it's no real coincidence that both this filmed sequel & Robert Bloch's novel Psycho II ( both of which are completely different ) were produced . The script here by Tom Holland ( who appears in the film as Deputy Norris ) is a clever follow up to the original , there's plenty of good twist's & turns especially at the end when all the the events of the film come together really nicely in a somewhat bleak series of incidents & coincidences . I liked it but the problem with a film such as this where all it's impact & effectiveness comes from it's surprises & twist's is that once you've seen it the main strengths of the film are lost forever & as such has little in the way of replay value . The character's are all well written & fleshed out , there's some good dialogue & I like how the plot progresses . At around 110 minutes long there's plenty of time for the plot to develop , the pace is pretty good although a bit slow on occasion so don't expect lots of action as Psycho II relies on clever storytelling & some great twist's . The motel was rebuilt for the film in meticulous detail & the sets & look of the film overall feels a lot like the original . To cater for the 80's audience there's some nudity here as this time a shower scene yields some naked female flesh rather than a brutal murder & there's some slasher style murders with a stabbing , slashings , someone gets a large knife stuck into their mouth & a rotten corpse is seen . Apparently the telly version is padded out with extra scenes although at 110 minutes I think it's long enough as it is . With a supposed budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 Psycho II has good production values & some stylish cinematography with some very effective lighting . Shot mostly on the Universal Studios back-lot , the same one that recently burnt down . Meg Tilly has publicly gone on record as saying her worst experience in the film business was working with Anthony Perkins in this while both Perkins & Vera Miles return from the original . Robert Loggia & Dennis Franz supply good support . Psycho II was a much better film than I was expecting , it does try to please the 80's crowd a bit & once you know the twist's you will never be able to watch it in quite the same way again but for a first time viewing this is a clever psychological thriller with some neat surprises . Followed by Psycho III ( 1986 ) & Psycho IV : The Beginning ( 1990 ) .

Written , co-produced & directed by Glen Stephens I have mixed feelings about Hoboken Hollow , I sort of liked it & hated it in equal measure . The script starts off extremely promisingly in an isolated way out in the sticks The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) , The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 - 2006 ) & Wrong Turn ( 2003 ) sort of way as it sets the story up . Unfortunately while I was hoping for a slick , nasty atmospheric gore filled slasher by the mid way point of Hoboken Hollow I thought I was watching a prison drama as the story settles down & focuses on the trials & tribulations of the workers rather than the activity of the homicidal Broderick's , I'm all for a good story but this goes off the rails so to speak & once it had settled down I started to find myself becoming bored & a bit disinterested . Having said that it's still a decent little horror / thriller with some nice exploitation , some rape & a fair bit of torture although the final twist is as obvious as they come & I'm not convinced the guys kept there would have been so co-operative , I mean why didn't they just take the chainsaw they had been given to chop wood & use it against their captors , torturers & eventually murderers ? I know I would have at least tried to get away & a good old fashion chainsaw would have made for a decent weapon , right ? I'm confident I would have been able to convince my captors to hand over the keys to the pick-up truck with the aid of a trusty chainsaw . Director Stephens does a fine job , Hoboken Hollow is surprisingly well shot & has that isolated , baking hot Texan outback feel to it . The family & their house reminds of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre although Hoboken Hollow is more graphic & doesn't go for atmosphere or scares as much . The gore is OK , there's a severed arm , a severed foot fed to the pigs , someones leg is repeatedly stabbed , someone is impaled on a large spike & there's some torture where people are hanged , electrocuted & peed on . I think this is one of those films where you think you see more than you actually do . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 100 , 000 Hoboken Hollow is very well made with impressive production values & it actually looks like a proper film , the special effects are decent & there's a surprisingly good cast here including Sean Connery's son Jason ! I wonder if his dad's seen Hoboken Hollow because if he has I'd be more than interested to know what he thinks of it ! Michael Madsen , the great Dennis Hopper , Robert Carradine & Michelle's sister Dedee Pfeiffer who I haven't seen since her role in Vamp ( 1986 ) ! Hoboken Hollow is OK overall but I thought it had both good & bad points , unfortunately the bad points are pretty crucial to how I feel about it . It's an OK watch but I'd be hard pushed to recommend it to anyone .
497773	1355507	160620	7.0	" Tell me , does your purple little husband lend you some of his tampons ? " Nice enough thriller .	Oxygen starts one sunny afternoon in New York City as Frances Hannon ( Laila Robins ) is walking her pet dog around the block , a man ( Adrien Brody ) approaches her a begins to chat to her , at first he seems a pleasant & charming young man but he soon changes as he becomes aggressive , he threatens her & makes her get into a nearby car . He , & his accomplice ( Michael Henderson ) , drive off to a wood where they bury Frances alive in a wooden coffin , she has about 24 hours worth of air left & the clock is ticking . . . Detective Madeline Foster ( Maura Tierney ) & her partner Jesse ( Paul Calderon ) are called onto the task force to find Frances & apprehend her kidnappers . They are both briefed , Frances rich husband Clarke ( James Naughton ) has received a videotape that demands he pay a $1 , 000 , 000 ransom or Frances will be left to suffocate & die an agonising & terrifying death . The money drop off goes OK until the kidnapper figures out the police are watching him , Foster has no choice but to arrest him without the knowledge of where Frances is & once in custody he refuses to say anything , will Frances be found in time before she runs out of air & why does her young kidnapper seem so clam , almost as if he is enjoying himself or maybe there are other less clear motives behind the events of the previous day . . . Written , co-produced & directed by Richard Shepard I thought Oxygen was a nice tight , taut little thriller that isn't the sort of thing I usually like but it has a certain something about it . The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping & absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police & FBI , although I have to say once Harry is arrested & stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably . I would say that what Oxygen deals with is what many would consider their worst nightmare , being buried alive & slowly running out of air & perhaps more could have been done with this concept as it concentrates a little too much on the games played by Harry with the authorities . One more thing , Harry's precise & exact plans rely far too much on luck & things he simply has no control over to make me convinced that he could have come up with such an elaborate & implausible scheme . I mean his whole plan is based on the fact that he would be placed in one room , in that they would handcuff him in a certain way & that he would definitely be able to pick the locks , that they would agree with his demands to the absolute letter & that there is a air conditioning vent in the room just big enough to crawl through & that he could actually reach it as well as being able to keep total control over a hostage so they don't raise the alarm . That's an awful lot of coincidences & a whole lot of luck as well . The character's are well developed & fleshed out , they have a little bit more depth than usual I loved the monologue about the lethal injection from the FBI agent who was meant to be intimidating . Director Shepard does an OK job without being particularly outstanding , as a whole Oxygen is a little bland & forgettable but the solid story should paper over the lacklustre visuals . The film lacks any real tension or excitement but it does retain ones interest throughout , again thanks to the story . There isn't any violence to speak of except a gory gunshot wound at the end . Technically Oxygen is OK , it's competently made , there are a few nice New York shots & a couple of minor car chases although there isn't much action as it's a dialogue & storyline driven film . The acting is good especially from the two leads , Tierney as the cop & the effective Brody as the cold , calculating villain . Oxygen is a good thriller , it's short on action or violence but it has a good strong story to compensate . Personally I think it's well worth a watch .
496928	1355507	95330	7.0	" This may appeal to your lurid taste in fiction Watson . " Fine adaptation of Holmes most famous case .	The Hound of the Baskervilles starts late one night at ' Baskerville Hall ' as Sir Charles Baskerville ( Raymond Adamson ) waits outside in his gardens , suddenly he hears a chilling howl coming from the moors . . . Dr . Mortimer ( Neil Duncan ) contacts contacts Sherlock Holmes ( Jeremy Brett ) & his assistant Dr . John Watson ( Edward Hardwicke ) & tells them of Sir Charles untimely death which he feels is suspicious , he talks about a 200 year old legend about a huge demonic hound that has terrorised the Baskerville family & that paw prints were found near Sir Charles body . Dr . Mortimer also says that the last remaining Baskerville Sir Henry ( Kristoffer Tabori ) is travelling from America to claim his inheritance . Upon arrival Sir Henry receives a threatening letter telling him to stay away from Baskerville Hall which he ignores & together with Dr . Watson & Dr . Mortimer travels to Devon & settle into Baskerville Hall . The list of suspects is long with the servants Mr . ( Ronald Pickup ) & Mrs . Barrymore ( Rosemary McHale ) acting strangely & the escaped murderer Selden ( William Ilkley ) running around the moors . . . Made for British TV by Granada & directed by Brian Mills this adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles is the second version of this classic tale I have seen this year & both were almost exactly the same . The script by T . R . Bowen based on the novel by Arthur Conan Doyle retains all the basic story elements , it moves along at a nice pace & is involving although if you know anything about the well told tale then nothing here will come as a surprise which isn't a problem with this version in itself it's just that there are so many versions around which I would imagine don't differ that much . Holmes takes a back seat for a large chunk of the film & I thought the ending was somewhat underwhelming & felt a little rushed which was probably down to it's budget & tight TV shooting schedule . The film was obviously shot on location & you couldn't ask for more of the British countryside & the manor house used . The budget probably wasn't as high as the other one I saw as it looks a little basic at times , there is no extravagant production design & everything is kept quite simple yet still maintains it's effectiveness . The Hound itself has a silly green glowing special effect to it & isn't really in the film that much . The acting is strong throughout but I'm not sure about Brett as Holmes , don't really know why but I didn't like him that much . Overall it's a good solid engaging adaptation of what now must surely be a story told far too often as once you've seen one of them there isn't much interest in seeing any other . If you have never seen a Hound of the Baskervilles before than I can easily recommend this one but if you have I can't see the point in sitting through this . Good for Holmes virgins & completest's but old hat if your familiar with the story .
498788	1355507	65491	7.0	A nasty little film .	The opening sequence is set in the middle of some forest somewhere , the local witch finder known as Albino ( Reggie Nalder ) lies in wait . They ambush a waggon full of nuns , they force it off the road and attack the passengers . We then cut to a town square , a large crowd of people have gathered to witness the torture and execution of the unfortunate people from the waggon . A man has his hand cut off and is coated in feathers , while two women are lowered alive into a huge fire , setting them alight . These are the brutal ways of Albino and his gang of witch hunters . As witchcraft has spiralled out of control Count Cumberland ( Herbert Lom ) and Count Christian Von Meruh ( Udo Kier ) are sent to the area to try and bring some order and check the local witch finders methods . The film thereafter is really just a collection of fairly brutal torture scenes , we see various accused have their thumbs crushed with thumb screws , branded , whipped , beaten , forced to sit on a chair of nails , their tongues ripped out , burned alive , beheaded and various other forms of torture , whats not to like ? ! These scenes are presented in a simple way , their there to shock . The film doesn't try to glamorize them , there brutal acts of torture and are presented that way . Directed by Micheal Armstrong , this is a pretty good horror film . The script certainly fleshes out the characters nicely , the Albino character is shown as a total monster , raping , torturing , making up false charges , murdering , and enjoying the benefits like power and money . Lord Cumberland is basically the same , however he justifies what he's doing in the name god , and seems to believe it . Christian is a young man , learning his trade from Cumberland , he falls for a falsely accused woman from the village , Vanessa ( a sexy Olivera Vuco ) . She manages to plant doubt in his mind about his and Cumberland's brutal ways . Corruption is also explored , and how various individuals could gain from having someone accused of witchcraft and basically murdered , technically within the law at the time . A nicely paced mix of brutal torture / action and plot / character development . The film also seems to have very good production values , great authentic looking period costumes and locations , the music's quite appropriate sounding too . Acting wise , Herbert Lom steals the show as Lord Cumberland . If you can make it through the torture , rape and sex then you should be rewarded with a good little film . I liked it .
497597	1355507	70047	7.0	A genre classic ?	The Exorcist is set in Georgetown in Washington DC where famed actress Chris MacNeil ( Ellen Burstyn ) & her twelve year old daughter Regan ( Linda Blair ) live in a large house . Having recently moved there after separating from her husband Chris becomes increasingly worried by her daughter's odd behaviour , Regan spouts obscenities , masturbates with a crucifix & acts very violently towards people . After various tests Doctor's are at a loss to explain medically what is wrong with Regan & suggest Chris contacts a psychiatrist or even stage a exorcism . Things continue to get worse as is turns out Regan is responsible for the murder of film director Burke Dennings ( Jack MacGowran ) , desperate Chris turns to Father Damian Karras ( Jason Miller ) for help who after his own investigation is convinced Regan is possessed by a demon & recommends to the Church that an exorcism be performed . . . Directed by William Friedkin one probably has to say that The Exorcist is one of the most famous & widely regarded horror films ever made with reports of audience members vomiting , fainting & mass walk-outs in theatres the film has a definite controversy & legacy surrounding it . Originally released on Boxing Day 1973 in the US at around the two hour mark The Exorcist was re-released in 2000 with about twelve minutes of restored footage & some subtle CGI work under the title The Exorcist : The Version You've Never Seen & it is this longer cut that I will be basing my comments on . The script by William Peter Blatty which was based on his novel stands up pretty well when viewed today , there's real building of momentum as the film starts off with a very normal mother & daughter only for the film to show Regan get worse & worse & the effect it has on the people around her & as it all snowballs . At first Regan's mother tries to cure her daughter with modern medical science but when that fails more unorthodox methods are used . The film has lots of religious overtones which probably didn't go down to well at the time of it's release with some really foul language , scenes of defiled statues in Church , Regan masturbating with a crucifix & the eventual exorcism which the film ultimately builds up to . The character's are very good , the film certainly held my interest throughout even though I generally dislike long films & there are one or two iconic & memorable set-pieces like the head twisting scene & of course the green vomit the possessed Regan spews over Karras . My only real problem is that The Exorcist goes on for a bit too long , while I didn't get bored I did start to look at the clock , it's never explained what the mysterious noises in the attic were & I wasn't keen on the new ending with Kinderman & Dyer walking off to the ' this could be the start of a beautiful relationship ' line . With a filming schedule that was originally planned for 85 days yet went on for 224 the film has a certain intensity & a cold matter of fact style about it , the camera remains quite static & the shots are very long unlike films today where it looks like the cameraman is having a fit & the editing is so quick you can barely tell whats happening . There are some great moments & I especially love the unexpected jump scare in the attic when the candle bursts into flame , it's such a cheap scare effect yet so effective . The Exorcist isn't the goriest or most violent film ever made , there's only two dead bodies in it , some blood in a medical scene & that's about it , it's probably the disturbing nature of the things that happen that are so effective & memorable rather than because they are graphic . The special make-up effects by Oscar winner Dick Smith are superb as you would expect . Watching the extended version last night I was very aware of how little music there is in the film , in fact apart from the opening & closing credits I can't actually remember any during the film itself at all . There's a definite sense of unease & dread as the film builds up to it's climax & this is where I personally think the film fails to deliver , after such an excellent sustained build up the ending is nothing more than two guy's standing around a bed chanting silly sounding religious lines of dialogue . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 The Exorcist is very well made & certainly looks good if a little basic by todays standards . The special effects are good & the new extended cut doesn't go overboard on the CGI . Filmed throughout New York , the Warner Bros . studios in California , Washington & Iraq in which an all British film crew were hired since the US had no diplomatic relations with Iraq back then , not that they do now of course either ! The acting is very good from a strong cast , although Linda Blair played the possessed Regan & was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for the role she was actually dubbed throughout . The Exorcist is regarded as some sort of landmark classic in the horror genre which I suppose it is & while it's an undeniably great film all round I don't hold it in such high regard since it's just not that much fun to watch . Followed by the entertainingly awful Exorcist II : The Heretic ( 1977 ) , the average Exorcist III ( 1990 ) & the rather excellent prequel Exorcist : The Beginning ( 2004 ) which itself was re-cut & altered & re-released as Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist ( 2005 ) .
498618	1355507	96098	7.0	Great little discussed thriller .	Shoot to Kill starts late one night in San Francisco as diamond merchant Mr . Berger ( Milton Selzer ) sets the alarm off in his jewellery shop & the police show up , still in his pyjama's with a couple of pounds of diamonds it's clear that he's being forced to act against his will & when questioned by special FBI agent Warren Stantin ( Sidney Poitier ) he admits that an armed man has his wife as a hostage . The local police & Stantin try to negotiate the release of Mrs . Berger ( Janet Rotblatt ) but the plan only ends up getting her killed & the killer escaping with the diamonds . The next day & the killer is trying to cross the border into Canada through a small town called Bishop Falls but is spooked when he sees a large police presence & decides to kill a member of a hiking group & take his place so he can cross the border on foot . Meanwhile Stantin learns of the man's death which was in the same unique manner Mrs . Berger was killed & sets off after his man through the tricky & rough mountainous terrain . . . Directed by Roger Spottiswoode & known under the better title of Deadly Pursuit here in the UK I thought this was a great action thriller which doesn't often get mentioned . The script by Harv Zimmel , Michael Burton & Daniel Petrie Jr . takes itself pretty seriously although there are one or two light hearted moments surrounding agent Stantin's ' fish out of water ' type situation even if the scene where he confronts a Grizzly Bear & scares it off by flapping his arms in the air is a little too silly . The film moves along at a nice pace & mixes the genres of thriller , action & whodunit very effectively . The character's are good & I liked the way that despite working together agent Stantin & his guide didn't suddenly become the best of friends & have long deep , meaningful conversations about their lives as in say Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) because that's just so clichéd . In fact there isn't that much dialogue spoken in the film & poor Kirstie Alley barely says a word ! Shoot to Kill starts off as a whodunit mystery but about half way through it reveals the killer & it changes in tone & becomes a taught thriller & I actually rather liked this abrupt & unexpected change in direction it took . A good solid throughly entertaining thriller with a decent cast that's worth a look but won't have much replay value as once you know the killer the films twist won't have any impact & the entire first half will lose it's effectiveness . Director Spottiswoode does a good job here , the isolated forest locations are well used & the film has a nice tension to it especially during it's first half when we don't know who the killer is . There are some good action scenes including chases , a car chase , some shoot outs & people hanging over cliffs on rope although when John hits that cliff face the force & impact would have broken just about every bone in his body . The violence & body count are relatively low as is the profanity but that makes a nice chance . Technically the film is fine with nice location shooting , it was shot largely in Canada with the opening sequence shot in San Fransico . It's well made & I would have imagined it had a decent budget coming from the Disney owned Touchstone Pictures . The acting is good & there's a pretty impressive cast here . Shoot to Kill , I much prefer the title Deadly Pursuit , is a neat little action thriller with a good concept that's not predictable has unusual relationships between the character's & is well worth a watch .
497319	1355507	57129	7.0	Overrated , good but not brilliant .	The Haunting starts with anthropology university professor Dr . John Markway ( Richard Johnson ) gaining permission to investigate the notorious Hill House from it's current owner Mrs . Sanderson ( Fay Compton ) , a supposedly haunted property . He assembles a team of assistant's , Eleanor ' Nell ' Lance ( Julie Harris ) who had paranormal experiences as a child , clairvoyant Theodora ( Claire Bloom ) & the house's cynical heir Luke ( Russ Tamblyn ) . They all meet up at the large foreboding Hill House & quickly settle down to work , as time passes it becomes very apparent that Hill House is indeed haunted by an unseen presence . . . Produced & directed by Robert Wise I have to go against ' popular ' opinion here & say that I think The Haunting is far from the classic that many here seen to make it out to be . The script by Nelson Gidding was based on the novel ' The Haunting of Hill House ' by Shirley Jackson & I thought it was pretty dull , it's too long & rather slow . Then there's the character's , I have to say that I absolutely loathed Nell as a character & she annoyed me immensely & I just couldn't feel anything for her at all . Then there's Theodora & Luke who are given virtually no screen time compared to Nell , in comparison they are very underdeveloped & as a result I felt very little for them as well . Many people like the fact that all the horror in The Haunting is suggested , it's all built up & left to the imagination , this is fine if you like this sort of technique but I just thought sitting through this film felt like a lot of effort for not much reward . Having said that it's still a good film , it does what it sets out to do perfectly well , it's well written , it ticks all the right boxes & it has a few decent scenes but overall I have to say I was disappointed by it , ironically probably because of all the overwhelmingly positive comments I've read about it it ended up being a disappointment . Director Wise does a good job here , this is where The Haunting excels . The crisp black and white photography works perfectly to create some very atmospheric scenes , the Hill House sets are also very evocative & create a nice sense of dread . However , the pace of the film drags & it starts to become a chore to watch it . Wih a supposed budget of about $1 , 400 , 000 The Haunting obviously had a fair amount of time & effort spent on it's look & feel & in this respect it's very good , unfortunately the acting & character's don't help the film . The Haunting is a good film to be sure , to be fair I think it's a film of it's age & those who like these slow moving films will have a ball while other's may want to stock up on coffee to get through it . Overall I'd say I was very disappointed but I can certainly see some merit in it .
497634	1355507	307667	7.0	Good documentary spoilt slightly by poor presentation .	The Wicker Man Enigma is a 35 minute-ish documentary that features on quite a few DVD editions of the classic horror film The Wicker Man ( 1973 ) , as far as these sorts of documentary's go it's a good ' un . A lot of the films production team are featured in the documentary , from the director & writer to the stars . It's basically a chronological story in which the cast & crew detail the making of the film & it's distribution problems starting with writer Anthony Shaffer who goes into the inspiration behind the film saying that he wanted to write a horror film but something significantly different from the likes of what Hammer studios were churning out . Various people talk about the making of the film & there's a neat montage here of locations from the film as they were in 2000 , I'd have said as they are now but this documentary was made 7 years ago & it's not unreasonable to think the locations might have significantly changed again . Christopher Lee again claims that he got paid nothing for making The Wicker Man & he still has his contract to prove it . Then it goes into the problems they had with the distributors & that the head of EMI told Christopher Lee it was one of the ten worst films he'd ever seen , it had chunks edited out of it & placed on a double bill with Don't Look now ( 1973 ) which the company also hated . Then there's the tragic story of how all the negatives , cut footage & outtakes were buried under the M3 by mistake before it goes on to discuss how the film is thought of these days & it's ' revival ' . Now , The Wicker Man Enigma would have been a great documentary as it's very informative , the interviewees speak freely & it's not a back patting self congratulatory promotional piece if not for the bizarre presentation . We have all seen films in widescreen on our TV's where there are black bars at the top & bottom of the screen which is fine but on The Wicker Man Enigma there are horrible distracting black bars on all four sides of the frame , why is the question I ask here , why ? It's almost like there's a TV ' within ' your TV & I am at a loss to see why the makers put a huge black frame around the picture , I personally found it irritating beyond belief but there you go . Overall this is a great documentary but why the black frame ? It's a very odd film-making decision & it bugged me more & more as time went by , I suppose it's a small grumble though when you consider it's a free extra on a DVD . Definitely worth a watch if your a fan of the film .
497608	1355507	55304	7.0	" Am I not the spawn of his depraved blood ? " Impressive 60's Edgar Allan Poe adaptation from Roger Corman .	Pit and the Pendulum ( there is no ' The ' at the beginning of the on screen title ) starts in 1546 somewhere in Spain . Francis Barnard ( John Kerr ) has travelled from England to investigate his sister Elizabeth's ( Barbara Steele ) sudden death . Francis arrives at a large foreboding mist enshrouded castle that sits on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean & belongs to Elizabeth's husband , Nicholas Medina ( Vincent Price ) . Francis knocks the door and Maximillian ( Patrick Westwood ) the butler answers . Nicholas's sister Catherine Medina ( Luana Anders ) also turns up and invites Francis in . Nicholas tells Francis that Elizabeth died unexpectedly three months ago from a condition of the blood . Francis is unimpressed by Nicholas's explanations and feels he is not being told the truth . The only other person in the castle at this point is the maid , Maria ( Lynette Bernay ) . At dinner that night Dr . Charles Leon ( Antony Carbone ) turns up . His side of events differ from Nicolas's . Leon claims that Elizabeth died from sheer fright as she became obsessed with a torture chamber situated in the bowls of the castle that belonged to Sebastian Medina ( Vincent Price , again ) , Nicolas's Father who was one of the most cruel and feared members of the Spanish Inquisition . Catherine's body has been resting in the Medina's families tomb for months but the distraught Nicholas fears that Catherine may have been buried alive , like his Mother . Strange occurrences start to happen , whispering voices & unexplained incidents that suggest Nicholas may be right and somehow Catherine has returned for revenge ! As the night draws on the sinister goings-on are revealed as a thunder storm rages outside , but can anyone survive the ultimate terror of the Pit and the Pendulum ! ? Produced and directed by Roger Corman I was pretty impressed with this adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe novel of the same name . Pit and the Pendulum was the second of Corman's Poe adaptations coming after the House of Usher ( 1960 ) & before Premature Burial ( 1962 ) . The script by Richard Matheson effectively mixes haunted house horror & psychological terror with a satisfying twist ending . An ending that may not come quite as much of a surprise these days but is still very good all the same . I also loved the final ' poetic justice ' shot . There aren't many characters in the film but the ones there count . The acting is good all round but I did think Price went over the top a little at certain points , although one could argue that this was deliberate and was intended to be relevant to the twist ending . Having said that I wouldn't want any other actor but Price in the role . Forget about blood or gore as there isn't any , but don't let this put you off as a horror film doesn't have to be gory or violent to be good . One thing about Pit and the Pendulum that really stands out is the overall production design , sets , costumes and lighting . The film has a wonderful Gothic look throughout . The castle's cobweb strewn torture chamber , or it's gloomy flickering candle lit rooms and corridors with it's stonework walls . The solid antique looking furniture and props . The whole film is lavish and really looks the part , the evocative sets create half of the wonderful atmosphere on their own . Quite amazing considering that the budget was apparently only $200 , 000 which probably wasn't a lot even back in 1961 . Generally speaking the film is also well made throughout and at just under 80 minutes it never drags and is consistently both interesting & entertaining . On the negative side I'm not too sure I would watch it again now I know the twist ending and when all said and done not a great deal actually happens . But it's still a great character and plot driven Gothic horror / thriller from the early 60's that stands up very well even today & should be seen by all fans of the genre , so what are you waiting for ? Watch it !
497160	1355507	214950	7.0	" In regards to your Goose I'd say it was well & truly cooked . " More classic Midsomer Murders .	Midsomer Murders : Blood Will Out is set in the Midsomer village of Martyr Warren where traveller Orville Tudway ( Kevin McNally ) & a few of his friends arrive , they park their caravans on Will ( John Duttine ) & Muriel Saxby's ( Elizabeth Garvie ) land which annoys & irritates rich local magistrate & Falkland's war hero Major Hector Bridges ( Paul Jesson ) . When one of the Major's Geese mysteriously disappears he calls in DCI Tom Barnaby ( John Nettles ) & Sgt . Troy ( Daniel Casey ) to investigate , the Major points the finger at Orville . Then another group of travellers pitch up on a green outside the local Church , during a pony chariot race organised by the travellers Major Bridges is shot dead in his own manor house & a simple PR exercise to keep a powerful magistrate happy becomes a full blown murder investigation for Barnaby . He has to sort through all the lies to find the killer , a task not made any easier by the fact the entire village seemed to hate the Major who was a pretty nasty piece of work . . . Episode 4 from season 2 this Midsomer Murders mystery was the final story from the second season & out of the first two seasons which contain nine stories there hasn't been a bad one yet , while Blood Will Out doesn't quite reach the lofty heights set by some of the earlier stories it's still a great crime drama & it's as simple & straight forward as that . Directed by Moira Armstrong & written by Douglas Watkinson this story has all the essential parts for a terrific mystery , there's the usual assortment of fine character's many of whom could have done it , there's the careful well thought out back-story & various red herrings which are thrown in there to confuse us & the part I like best it has a great twist ending which I admit I did guess before it was revealed although I doubt many will , maybe I was just lucky . One part of this story I didn't think worked that well was the second death of John Smith the traveller , once it has been committed Barnaby almost seems to ignore it on purpose & continues to exclusively concentrate on the Major's death & I'd almost forgotten about it by the time an explanation for it was given . Also why didn't Barnaby charge Orville for cruelty to animals or theft in regards to the Goose he stole & ate ? Still , they are small quibbles as the Major's murder was at the center of everything anyway so it doesn't matter a whole lot . This is yet another top murder mystery from this quality crime drama that's as good as anything out there in this genre , as usual I liked it & found it both engrossing & intriguing which is one of the show's real strengths . This story features a humorous subplot about Barnaby being forced to diet by his wife & daughter , it doesn't get in the way of the main story but is a light hearted & amusing addition to the script . The English locations are nice to look at , the real life village of Hambleden in Buckinghamshire was used as Martyr Warren . This would be a great show to film in HD ( High Definition ) as the extra detail on the beautiful locations would make it worthwhile right down to the individual blades of grass . There's a scenes when someone is killed with a shotgun which has some blood splatter & there's a dead body with a head wound so if you don't like the sight of blood be warned . The acting as always is top notch . Blood Will Out doesn't quite reach the standards of the earlier Anthony Horowitz written / Jeremy Silberston directed episodes but is still a great Midsomer Murders & isn't too far behind them . This is the last episode of season 2 & there hasn't been a bad one yet !

E . : The Final Gift starts as two old Korean war buddies of Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who co-own ' California Air ' a small plane business take off on a business flight . On route the plane develops a problem & they are forced to crash land , Max Carson ( Tom Troupe ) is badly cut & needs medical help . Luckily a local man named Pete ( James Whitworth ) saw the plane crash & offers assistance to Max & his partner Charlie Barnes ( Joseph Campanella ) . Pete drives them to the local doctor where Max is given an emergency transfusion of Charlie's blood . Later at Hospital & Max suddenly & mysterious dies , Quincy says he will do the autopsy himself & finds that Max died from arsenic poisoning . Suspecting foul play Quincy sets out to discover the truth . . . Episode 20 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & is a pretty fun fifty odd minutes that fans of the show should like . The plot here in The Final Gift is quite good although I wish the makers hadn't made what was going on so bleedin obvious , every time Charlie is given a cup of coffee there's a great big close-up on the mug just so we know that he is being given lots of coffee that is laced with arsenic . A bit of subtlety might have been nice , the plot is still solid though & it will probably keep you guessing until the end , hell I'd have put my mortgage on that secretary having something to do with it . As usual it is proved that knowing Los Angeles coroner Quincy can be very bad for your health as yet another one of his friends / acquaintances dies , the guy is just a jinx . At fifty odd minutes The Final Gift moves along at a good pace & there's a nice irony in the ending as the killer only ended up killing themself & if the killer hadn't tried to kill his victim they wouldn't be dead . The budget here couldn't stretch to the plane crash so it happens off screen , I would have thought it would have been too dangerous to do in reality anyway . Joseph Campanella makes the second of his four guest appearances on Quincy playing different character's in all of them while Edward Grover makes the fifth appearance of his eight on the show . The acting is pretty good all round with Klugman again shining as usual . The Final Gift is a good solid Quincy murder mystery , while it's nothing that original it's a fun episode fans of the show should enjoy as well as armchair detectives everywhere .
498349	1355507	890870	7.0	I am still enjoying the series anyway .	Saw IV starts as Detective Hoffman ( Costas Mandylor ) , SWAT team leader Officer Rigg ( Lyriq Bent ) & their team find the dead mutilated body of Detective Kerry ( Dina Meyer ) in one of notorious killer Jigsaw's ( Tobin Bell ) traps . FBI agents Strahm ( Scott Patterson ) & Perez ( Athena Karkanis ) both feel Jigsaw has some sort of accomplice & are determined to find out who it is , meanwhile with Detective Eric Matthews ( Donnie Wahlberg ) still missing & the bodies continuing to pile up Officer Rigg just can't let it go & somehow feels responsible & helpless . Later that night in his apartment Rigg is knocked out & comes round in his bathroom faced by Jigsaw on his telly as Rigg finds himself part of the horrific games that Jigsaw likes to play . Jigsaw gives Rigg ninety minutes to save both Detectives Matthews & Hoffman who are now both at the mercy of Jigsaw in one of his deadly traps but Jigsaw makes sure it's not easy for Rigg who has lots of difficult decisions to make along the way . . . Like Saw II ( 2005 ) & Saw III ( 2006 ) this third sequel to the surprise sleeper smash hit horror thriller Saw ( 2003 ) was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman & I have to say that at this point I am still enjoying the Saw franchise . While maybe not quite as good as Saw II or definitely not as good as the rather excellent Saw III one has to say that I enjoyed Saw IV , it moves along like a rocket , there's a few decent twist's & turns although if you have seen the previous Saw films they will perhaps seem a little familiar but they are still good twist's . Now , I think the main problems with Saw IV are that it tries to shoehorn too many bit part character's from the previous three films into the script , there were a few times when I was confused about who was who & what connection they had to the series if any . While Saw IV works as a stand alone film for the majority of it's 90 odd minute duration it's definitely an advantage if you have seen the other films prior to watching this & then there's the ending which I liked but it could have been scripted a little better so it was a bit clearer about what had actually happened & this is the one aspect of the film that pretty much relies on you having seen at least Saw III . Basically the twist is that the film is actually a flashback after the gruesome opening autopsy which makes the audience think they are watching a straight chronological sequel to Saw III when in fact you are not , the events of Saw III & Saw IV take place simultaneously in a rather neat & clever twist that a lot of viewers ( judging by the IMDb message board for Saw IV & a few of the User Comments I have read ) don't seem to understand , get or even comprehend which is partly down to the filmmakers as I have already said since the ending is a bit abrupt , a little underwritten & relies on the audience having seen ( & remembering ) Saw III . Overall though I liked Saw IV , the character's are good with yet more back-story for the character's especially Jigsaw & the relationship between him & his ex-wife , the plot is pretty clever & it does all come together nicely at the end without any apparent plot holes & there's some more crackingly gory set-pieces that I personally just can't get enough of . Well one has to say if your looking for some blood , sadism & gore then you could do a lot worse than Saw IV , it starts off with an extremely graphic autopsy sequence the likes of which I have never seen in a major film before . I was amazed at how nasty the autopsy scene is , from the skin on Jigsaw's scalp being pulled back over his face to the top of his skull being sawed off & his brain removed to his chest being sliced open , his ribcage opened up & his stomach removed . It's actually pretty gruelling stuff & if your easily squeamish you may want to give Saw IV a miss . Other gore highlights include mutilated rat infested bodies , a woman having her scalp torn off , a guy getting his eyeball pierced , some guy's head being crushed between two huge blocks , two people are skewered with metal spikes with predictably bloody results & a scene which even made me wince a little when a guy has to free himself from a trap by pushing his face through two columns of razor sharp knives therefore slicing his face to bits . If that wasn't enough the poor guy then falls into a cage full of barb wire ! Ouch . Having said that I don't think this is quite as gory or brutal as Saw III though . Apparently Saw IV was given the green-light before Saw III was even made or released as both were commissioned at the same time shortly after Saw II opened to huge box-office business . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 & apparently shot in just 32 days in Ontario in Canada Saw IV took over $31 , 000 , 000 during it's opening weekend at the box-office , the production values & special effects are slick & I particularly liked some of the neat editing transitions between scenes . The acting is fine if nothing spectacular , quite a few of the cast return from previous instalments . Saw IV is another great entry in a pretty good horror franchise which I suppose you will either love it's twist's & scenes of brutal torture & gore or simply hate it as sick pointless rubbish , in my opinion I'd vote for the former any day of the week . Being such a big financial hit Saw V ( 2008 ) was guaranteed while yet another sequel Saw VI ( 2009 ) is in production .
499185	1355507	805570	7.0	I liked it but it could have been even better .	The Midnight Meat Train is set in New York City where freelance photographer Leon Kauffman ( Bradley Cooper ) lives with his waitress girlfriend Maya Jones ( Leslie Bibb ) taking & selling pictures of crime & accident scenes . Leon thinks he can do better & his mate Jurgis ( Roger Bart ) introduces him to super rich & super influential socialite it girl Susan Hoff ( Brooke Shields ) who says that she is not too impressed with his work , determined to prove her wrong & start making some money Leon sets out to take some great pictures & ends up at a subway station where he photographs a model ( Nora ) being attacked by a gang of thugs & subsequently saves her . Then it's reported soon after that the model has disappeared , retracing & investigating the events of that night Leon discovers that something very grisly is happening on the late night trains that run in the subway . . . Directed by Japanese filmmaker Ryuhei Kitamura this feature length horror film was based on a short story by British horror author Clive Barker that was published way back in 1984 in Volume One of his six volume Books of Blood series & it does show since the first hour or so of The Midnight Meat Train does tend to go round in circles with seemingly little happening in the script by Jeff Buhler . Once the initial premise that Vinnie Jones is going round slaughtering people on the subway is set-up the film doesn't do anything with it until the final twenty or so minutes where the twists & explanations kick in although strangely enough the ending is the worse part of the film with some feeble & oddly unclear attempts at trying to tie the loose ends up but there are more than a few unanswered questions left . For instance no explanation is given for the marks cut into Leon's chest , no explanation is given to the warts on Mahogany's chest , no explanation is given to who the conductor is , who cleans the blood stained trains , what the creatures are & why they are being helped or why Leon suddenly becomes the next butcher so easily . Ironically enough even though the film version could have devoted some of it's increased duration on solving these loose ends the short story actually makes a better fist of it with Barker giving much more reasoning behind the grisly events like explaining that the creatures were apparently called ' Father's ' & were a secret society that ran the world but they need human flesh to live & that the rulers of our society provided it with the mobile slaughterhouse the midnight meat train that is delivered to them every night . The cuts on Leon's chest were symbols to signify that the ' Father's ' had chosen him to become the next butcher & the warts on Mahogany's chest were to signify he was dying & that he needed to be replaced which obviously ties everything up quite nicely so why these vital points were left out of this filmed adaptation is a mystery to me . The pace is good , there's quite a bit of incident , the early mystery elements are fairly intriguing & certainly kept me watching wanting to see where it was going although there's hardly any dialogue or character's & apart from the main plot there really isn't anything else going on at all & you can sort of tell it was based on a very limited idea . One has to say that The Midnight Meat Train looks fantastic with some really stylish & cool cinematography as the camera is placed in various positions & CGI is used to provide some memorable shots like a following a bullet through someone's head or a scene in which a woman is decapitated & the shot is from her point of view before the camera zooms out of her eye showing her head lying on the floor to a fight on the train at the end & the camera does several consecutive 360 sweeps around the action as the camera goes in & out of the train in one consecutive unbroken move . In my opinion The Midnight Meat Train looks fabulous & is one of the most stylish horror flicks of recent times . There's a fair amount of gore but maybe not as much as some would have you believe , someone is hit on the back of the head & their eyeball flies out , there's plenty of blood splatter , someone is shot through the eye , there are stabbings & impalement's , people are hung up on meat hooks through their ankles , someone has their heart cut out , someone's tongue is ripped out & the whole film has a raw brutality with the art & imagery of butchery dominating the look of the film as slaughterhouses are seen & all manner of butchers implement's are used throughout . With an estimated budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 The Midnight Meat Train was dumped into 102 discount theatres by Lionsgate rather than given a full release at regular first run cinemas which is undoubtedly why it flopped . The film looks great although one or two CGI shots are poor especially some of the CGI blood which doesn't convince at all . Although set in New York this was filmed entirely in Los Angeles . The acting is good from a decent cast with Hollywood hard man Vinnie Jones only getting two words of dialogue during the entire film while Brooke Shields has a small role . The Midnight Meat Train had great potential & to be fair to it I still liked it but the ending doesn't do it any favours although the visual flair & style & some cracking gore scenes certainly make it well worth a watch if your interested in the horror genre & it's miles better than most of the recent low budget horror crap coming out & littering video store shelves at the moment .
499145	1355507	350663	7.0	" Just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist . " Decent ' creatuire feature ' , one of the better examples in fact .	Bugs starts with a cop ( Xuan Fraser ) chasing a suspect into subway tunnel construction site , once inside the cop is killed by something nasty lurking in the shadows . . . FBI agent Matt Pollack ( Antonio Sabato Jr . ) is called in when the cops limbless torso is discovered & is thought to be the work of a serial killer whom Pollack is after . Pollack disagrees but stays on the case when he finds some strange slime on the body , it is sent to entomologist Emily Foster ( Angie Everhart ) who confirms the substance is insect enzyme & she has never seen anything like it before . Meanwhile the half completed subway tunnel is hosting a VIP party on a train when the guests are attacked & slaughtered by large scorpion type insects that have been awoke from they're centuries long hibernation by the construction . Word of the massacre gets to Pollack & Foster who call in a special marine unit lead by officer Benton ( Duane Murray ) to prevent whatever's lurking down there from making it out . . . This Canadian production was directed by Joseph Conti & I personally thought Bugs was a throughly entertaining & harmless way to pass 80 odd minutes ( it states on the IMDb that with commercials it runs 120 ! Talk about ruining the pacing & flow of a film ! But not the version I saw thankfully . . . ) . The script by Robinson Young , Patrick Doody & Chris Valenziano is at heart a pretty clichéd creature feature but I think one of the better ones that I have seen . Bugs has a conveyor belt script , the monster threat that become intelligent when the story needs them to be , the isolated location , the race against time , the hero , the scientist , the marines with big guns , the corrupt corporate official & the disposable creature food . Having said that the clichés aren't as annoying as usual , it moves along at a really nice pace has surprising amounts of gore , decent CGI & puppet creature effects , a neat underground subway location & has a good feel to it . One thing I did notice is how much it rips-off or pay homage , whichever way you want to look at it I suppose , to the film Aliens ( 1986 ) which in itself isn't a bad thing because every sci-fi horror lover knows how great Aliens is . I mean the marines sent into the creatures nest & their extermination relayed back via a video link & radio , the retreat from the nest to the safety of a getaway vehicle with the creatures in hot pursuit , the forming of barricades , the character's , one problem cropping up after another one being caused by an explosion , lots of dark tunnels & corridors , the strong female & male heroes , the fight with the queen at the end & just the overall feel of Bugs resembles Aliens very closely . Director Conti does an OK job & it is certainly better than it's made for TV status would have suggested , it isn't the best film ever but I think Bugs is far from the worst . The creatures themselves look like a cross between a scorpion & spider & are pretty cool , Conti wisely keeps them in the shadows & flickering lights to maintain their creepiness & try to hide any deficiencies in the CGI which I thought was actually rather good . There are pleasing amounts of gore , the cop at the beginning is impaled & his limbless torso is found & medically examined , there are severed arms , sliced throats & Conti doesn't forget about the red stuff either as every attack seems to feature fountains of blood spraying everywhere which is by no means a bad thing . Technically the Bugs is very good considering the TV budget limitations , it's somewhat bland & forgettable but it's well made & doesn't embarrass itself in any department . I must mention the computer systems in Bugs as they actually look plausible & realistic for a change . The acting was OK . Bugs was a pleasant surprise , maybe I've seen so many bad ' creature feature ' type films that a film like Bugs seems like a masterpiece . Hell , it's definitely better than Python ( 2000 ) . I think Bugs is well worth a watch especially if you like these monster films .
497290	1355507	82431	7.0	Pretty good Sci-Fi horror film from Roger Corman , you could do a lot worse .	Galaxy of Terror tells the tale of a rescue mission attempts to discover the fate of a spacecraft that landed on a planet called Morganthus & has not been heard from since . The spaceship Rebus takes off & within what seems like minutes arrives at Morganthus where they are drawn to the planet surface by an unknown force . Commander Ilvar ( Bernard Behrens ) , Captain Trantor ( Grace Zabriskie ) , the cook Kore ( Ray Walson ) & an engineer named Ranger ( Robert Englund ) remain aboard the Rebus as an exploration party is dispatched . First in command Baelon ( Zalman King ) , Cabren ( Edward Albert ) , a female telepathic Alluma ( Erin Moran ) , Dameia ( Taaffe O'Connell ) , Quuhod ( Sid Haig ) & a rookie named Cos ( Jack Blessing ) make their way to the crashed spacecraft . Inside as they discover the bodies of the previous crew Cos becomes very scared & sees a strange alien like spider creature which kills him . Back on Rebus they decide to investigate a strange area of landscape which their instruments cannot scan . Upon arrival they discover a large organic looking pyramid type alien structure , they decide to investigate . It's not long before more start to die in various gruesome ways . . . Co-written & directed by Bruce D . Clark I actually thought Galaxy of Terror was a much better film than I was expecting . The script by Clark & Marc Siegler is often referred to as an Alien ( 1979 ) rip off & while it obvious rides on the commercial success of Alien it tries to stand out a little more than a generic ' alien on the loose ' cash in , it actually has little in common with Alien besides being set in outer space . Galaxy of Terror has some nice ideas especially the pyramid which has the power to turn one's imagination & fears into one's deadliest enemy . Unfortunately more often than not director Bruce just uses this idea to kill people off in gory ways , I felt more could have been done with the idea than just use it to conjure up a few rubber monsters . One more complaint I have with Galaxy of Terror is that there are far too many pointless scenes of people walking around doing nothing in particular . The characters aren't that well developed & predictably clichéd but we know enough about each of them to get by & at least no one got on my nerves even if their silly sounding futuristic names did ! Technically Galaxy of Terror is surprisingly impressive & I'm pretty certain that has a lot to do with a young James Cameron who as the production designer works miracles on what must have been a low budget . The Morganthus landscape looks good while the alien pyramid & it's interiors look particularly impressive . I suppose the spacecraft sets look a little dated at times with the old fashioned flip switches used to operate things & some very dated looking computer graphics on it's monitors , but again given the budget their decent enough . The special optical effects less so , some look alright while others look poor although none really stand out either way except the guy with a red blur where his face should be which is accomplished with an awful super-imposed special effect . The deaths are cool & quite graphic , a slither of glass embeds itself in someone's arm & starts to travel upwards under their skin which results in them cutting their own arm off , there's plenty of alien tentacles & things sticking in people , a scene where a woman gets wrapped in blue alien vines & as they constrict she explodes , someone loses all their facial skin & the absolute showstopper of a sequence when Taaffe O'Connell is raped by a giant maggot alien creature which you have to see to believe . The cast has some familiar genre faces amongst it , Robert Englund & Sid Haig stand out . For what it is the acting is OK but nothing Oscar worthy . Generally speaking I found Galaxy of Terror a more than acceptable way to spend 80 odd minutes , it moves along at a fair pace & certainly isn't dull . Definitely worth a watch for enquiring Sci-Fi & horror fans .
498019	1355507	66993	7.0	" Sin may be caught as easily as the plague . " Controversial mix of sex , violence & religion .	The Devils is set in France during 1634 in a walled protestant town called Loudun which has just reached a truce with the rest of a mainly catholic France , the town is run by Father Urbain Grandier ( Oliver Reed ) an adulterous God loving man . However the power hungry Cardinal Richelieu ( Christopher Logue ) wants the catholic church to seize complete control of France & orders the destruction of Loudun , Father Grandier knows King Louis XIII ( Graham Armitage ) would not have sanctioned it & manages to stop the destruction . Cardinal Richelieu sees this as a temporary set back since he cannot convince King Louis to allow it , Richelieu sends in magistrate Baron Laubardemont ( Dudley Sutton ) & extremist Father Barre ( Michael Gothard ) to discredit Grandier & see that the destruction of Loudun can continue . . . This British production was written , produced & directed by Ken Russell & is certainly a memorable way to spend a couple of hours . The script was apparently based upon a play by John Whiting & the novel ' The Devils of Loudon ' by Aldous Huxley & claims to be based on truth . To be honest I am not a religious person & I openly & freely admit I haven't even read the bible so I cannot express any personal opinion about how The Devils relates to anything in either a good or bad way in the bible or religion in general . What I can express an opinion about though is whether The Devils is a good film or not & I firmly believe it is for those with loose enough sensibilities , it's a powerful film that maybe has some truth behind it , it paints a somewhat unflattering picture of the Church & the abuse of the power it had during the 17th Century over God fearing people , a power which it brutally exploited to it's own ends according to The Devils . From torture to false confessions to sexual deviancy The Devils isn't dull that's for sure , whether or not you will enjoy it depends on your tolerance levels for such material which deliberately mixes sex , religion & violence in a provocative way . I think it's a good film with strong character's , a good solid plot which you have to concentrate on to follow & some poetic dialogue . It's a bit slow in places & some of it is a little over-the-top but that adds to the entertainment value . Director Russell does a great job & The Devils looks simply sumptuous with brilliant sets including the white tiled Loudun which gives the film a clean sort of feel & an unusual look . The costumes are detailed as is the period setting in general . The film oozes style & visual flair with some beautiful yet at the same time disturbing scenes featuring naked Nun's , torture , religious fanaticism & sex set against the impressively realised backdrop of 17th Century France . The Devils has become controversial because of it's mix of sex , violence & religion & while there are a few graphic scenes this probably shocked more back in 1971 than does in 2007 . There is a fair amount of nudity but only one tame sex scene , while most of the female cast get their clothes off there is no male nudity , there are a couple of off screen enemas , there's a couple of torture scenes involving someones legs being broken & a pin stuck through someones tongue , there is implied masturbation , someone is agonisingly burned at the stake , victims of the plague are seen dumped into huge pits that contains 100's of bodies & a scenes when a sick woman has wasp's in jars attached to her body as a ' cure ' . I personally didn't think it was quite as shocking as it's generally made out to be . Technically the film is top notch with fine cinematography , high production values & good music . Set in France The Devils was actually shot at Pinewood Studios here in England . The acting is very strong here with a career best from Oliver Reed , he certainly though it was his best performance . The Devils has a big reputation to live up & while I think it can't quite manage it it's still a challenging film which deals with issues many may not agree with or want to watch . I liked it for what it is but then I'm not religious in any way so it didn't offend me in the way it might other's . A strong film & worth watching for those with the stomach .
496915	1355507	104688	8.0	" My boot , you kiss my boot if you want it so bad . " Another fine Holmes mystery .	The Last Vampyre starts with a prologue set in times past where a group of villagers burn a house down belonging to someone they believe is a vampyre . Fastforward 100 odd years later & Reverend Augustus Merridew ( Maurice Denham ) contacts legendary detective Sherlock Holmes ( Jeremy Brett ) & his assistant Dr . Watson ( Edward Hardwicke ) about the mysterious goings on in the village of Lambery since a stranger named John Stockton ( Roy Marsden ) arrived . The local villagers believe Stockton is a vampyre , Carter ( Andrew Abrahams ) the Blacksmith gorily died shortly after having an argument with Stockton , Miss Ruddock ( Hilary Mason ) an old spinster who lives opposite Stockton claims he never sleeps & the Reverend himself has seen Stockton prowl the church graveyard many times during the dead of night . At first Holmes seems uninterested but the Reverend goes onto say that Recardo ( Anthony Price ) the baby of Bob ( Keith Barron ) & Carlotta Ferguson ( Yolanda Vazquez ) died shortly after coming into contact with Stockton & that a unexplained plague is spreading through the village . Holmes accepts the case & faces superstitious locals & growing evidence that something supernatural may indeed be going on particularly after the Ferguson's maid Dolores ( Juliet Aubrey ) is found with two puncture wounds on her neck . . . This made-for-TV English , American co-production was directed by Tim Sullivan & a fine adaptation it is too . I will openly admit now that I have not read the short story ' The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire ' by Arthur Conan Doyle on which The Last Vampyre is based upon so I simply cannot compare the two , sorry . The script by Jeremy Paul is nice & involving as it draws you into the mystery but I was surprised that for the most part it doesn't centre on a murder . In fact Holmes states early on that no crime has been committed but accepts the case out of curiosity & it's mysterious elements . Once I got over that fact I became interested & engaged in the story which gripped me throughout as I really wanted to see where it was going . The character's are strong with plenty of mistrust , arguments , affairs & friendships & I liked where the story went as it built up to a pretty decent double twist ending as all is revealed . I have too say I didn't guess the outcome & bizarrely I couldn't stop thinking about the cool scene near beginning when Dolores the maid tries to make her boss's son Jack ( Richard Dempsey ) kiss her boots & what significance it had , or indeed will have , to the plot although to be fair the scene does have meaning in the context of the film , it's just a brief scene for some reason I couldn't stop thinking about whenever the character's reappeared on screen . Technically The Last Vampyre is very solid , while the budget probably wasn't huge the production is suitably impressive although there are still villages that look like the one in this in the UK even now , the props & settings are not too extravagant or detailed which gives it a certain bleak minimalist look & the costumes look & feel right . The acting is impressive from a good cast & I'm warming to Brett as Holmes having also seen his portrayal of the character in The Hound of the Baskervilles ( 1988 ) made a few years prior to this . Despite the fact that there is no murder for Holmes to investigate the other mystery elements of the story managed to grab & maintain my interest right through to the very satisfying climax where all is revealed . I think this is a must for Holmes & mystery fans alike & definitely worth a watch for more casual viewers as well , recommended .
497045	1355507	100814	8.0	" I vote for outer space . . . noway these are local boys . " Highly entertaining monster film .	Tremors is set in the small isolated American desert town of ' Perfection ' population 14 where friends Valentine McKee ( Kevin Bacon ) & Earl Bassett ( Fred Ward ) work as handymen & general dogs-bodies . One day they decide enough is enough , pack their things into their truck & head for a better life . However while driving along they discover the dead body of a local drunk named Edgar ( Sunshine Parker ) stuck up an electricity pylon . Val & Earl do the decent thing & report it but still plan on leaving Perfection but again while driving along they discover the decapitated head of Fred ( Michael Dan Wagner ) a local farmer & the remains of his sheep that have been torn to pieces . It's not long before they discover the cause of these deaths , huge worm like creatures that burrow just under the surface & eat just about anything that moves . Together with seismologist Rhonda LeBeck ( Finn Carter ) & her equipment they come to the conclusion that these creatures are headed straight for Perfection whose population is rapidly decreasing . . . Directed by Ron Underwood I thought Tremors was a great way to pass 90 odd minutes . The script by producers S . S . Wilson & Brent Maddock is an affectionate homage to all those giant monster films from the 50's & 60's , Tremors moves along at a nice pace & it never becomes either dull or boring as our human cast have to outwit the giant worms & stay alive . Tremors never takes itself seriously & is also quite light-hearted with various one-liners & jokes although some of Val & Earl's dialogue is pretty humorous as well plus they have a good on screen chemistry . The character's are a little clichéd , the good looking hero , the attractive female , the annoying kid & a store owner but they are all given a bit more life & depth than usual . My one real complaint is that Tremors seems to be trying to cater to the younger teen audience with an almost inevitable happy ending & a sense that nothing will happen that's going to shock or surprise . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 Tremors has some nice special effects with the worm creatures looking suitably monstrous & impressive , there isn't much in the way of blood or gore just a few splats of blood , some mutilated sheep & some exploding worms . It is well made throughout with nice cinematography that capture the expanse of the desert valley locations , good music & has that Hollywood polish too it . The acting is pretty good especially from Bacon & Ward who make this film although Michael Gross & Reba McEntire as the over-the-top gun toting survivalists Burt & Heather Gummer descend into annoying silliness a bit too often . Personally I think Tremors is well worth watching especially if your a horror fan but also those just looking for something fast paced , fun , entertaining & doesn't take itself seriously should find something here to enjoy , I reckon you should give it a go .
498876	1355507	496776	8.0	Decent special effects documentary .	Land of the Dead : Bringing the Dead to Life is a short 9 and a half minute documentary that looks at the special make-up effects used in George A . Romero's 2005 zombie film Land of the Dead . There isn't much to say about this one except it ' a precession of people who worked on Land of the Dead giving praise to Greg Nicotero the special effects guy . There are some nice behind-the-scenes stuff as they prepare the effects , apply the make-up & some initial screen tests but it's all too brief & a bit random . This can be found on the Land of the Dead DVD & it's an OK watch but it's not that informative . Worth it for the behind-the-scenes footage but it could have been presented better .
498875	1355507	381966	8.0	" How many different ways can sht smell ? " I rather liked it .	Creep starts as two London sanitation workers Arthur ( Ken Campbell ) & George ( Vas Blackwood ) are clearing a blockage deep under the streets when Arthur notices a new passageway that wasn't there before , venturing inside Arthur quickly becomes aware that something nasty has broken free & is lurking in the shadows . . . Meet Kate ( Franka Ptente ) who knows where George Clooney is hanging out & fancies a piece of the action so gets herself to the nearest tube station , unfortunately she falls asleep on the platform & misses her train . She searches for a way out but finds the station locked up , then another train stops at the platform & she gets on it in the hope that it will take her to a manned station . However the train suddenly stops , the lights go out & her nightmare is just about to start . . . This British German co-production was written & directed Christopher Smith & I have to say I rather liked it for a few reasons . The script of Creep takes itself extremely seriously & is all about the build-up , in fact the entire film is pretty much one long stalk ' n ' slash chase with all the false scares , the discovery of dead bodies strewn everywhere , the bit part character's being killed off & a shocking revelation . It's all here , present & correct . I don't usually like slow films but I think the build-up here is well handled & I found it quite watchable due to a certain air of mystery as the film doesn't try to give too much away to begin with although to be fair it's hardly rocket science & when it does shoot it's load it's not exactly life changing stuff but it'll do , hey this is just a horror film after all & doesn't try to be anything else . Whether you like the character's will depend , I can see both cases for liking them & hating them especially Kate who seems somewhat cold & isn't developed that much . To be honest I liked her , I don't want to hear her entire life story with long boring stretches of pointless dialogue , I liked the fact that she found herself in this horrible situation & just got on with it & nothing else really mattered . At least she didn't transform into some kung fu kick-boxing action hero that a lot of films would have turned her into . Plus thank god there wasn't any annoying American teenagers in this film , you see not all horror films need them . The creep himself isn't given any concrete story but there are clues to his origins here so make up your own mind , to me it's perfectly simple & easy to figure out . Creep probably bears a strong resemblance to another British horror film set on the Undrground called Death Line ( 1972 ) AKA Raw Meat in the US . Director Smith does a good job , I liked the way it looked even if it was a touch too dark at times . There's also something quite cool to know that I've been there , I've used the Underground many times & this is a perfectly reasonable representation of it & there wasn't anything that I thought was particularly far-fetched or unrealistic in it's portrayal . There's a nice atmosphere , a nice claustrophobia & a certain tension along with one or two cheap scares . The scene when the creep ' prepares ' for surgery is very effective & the London Underground is used pretty well throughout . I was disappointed with he gore on offer , it goes for realism rather than over-the-top fountains of blood . There's a decent slit throat , there's a fair few dead mutilated bodies , someone has the high heel of a stiletto shoe shoved in their eye , someone has their head impaled on a spike & in the films best death there's a really cool & gory demise at the end involving a hook , a speeding train & someones throat . . . Technically Creep is good & in fact better than I had expected , it's definitely well made & it's also nice to see a modern low budget horror actually shot on film in a 2 . 35 : 1 full widescreen ratio rather than a digital camcorder . The special effects are good & the make-up on the creep himself looks suitably , erm creepy . The acting was OK , no-ones going to win any Oscars but it was OK . Creep was a pleasant surprise for me , I rather liked it . I liked the atmosphere , I liked he setting , I liked the fact I've been there & it's all very British & I liked it as a horror film . Personally I think it's well worth a watch , but then that's just my opinion .
497643	1355507	182996	8.0	I love this cheap and cheerful horror film ! It's so gloriously entertaining in it's badness !	A woman ( Alma Ramas ) is murdered in a mountain stream deep in a remote Utah wood , the running water turns red with her blood . Shortly after a bird watcher ( McCormick Dalten ) has his arm chopped off with a machete and is also murdered . Meanwhile four young friends Peter ( Jack McClelland ) , Craig ( James Hayden ) , Ingrid ( Mary Gail Artz ) and Joanie ( Angie Brown ) are back packing through the mountains for a relaxing and fun few days in the wilderness . Back at the local town , the grossly overweight Sheriff ( Ken Carter ) and his Deputy ( David Barth ) have been getting lots of missing person reports . The Sheriff quickly dismisses them as nonsense . A man named Dale ( Dale Angell ) in the most garish horrible looking bright pink shirt and matching beret , along with his mother ( Ruth Grose ) is taking pictures of the beautiful scenery . They are both quickly killed by the as yet unknown psycho . The four back packers carry on deeper into the woods . After Craig , Ingrid and Joanie tease and make fun of Peter he decides to sleep on his own away from the others . That night more innocent people are killed . The next morning while by a stream on his own Peter sees a fisherman ( Hank Zinman ) killed by a ' wild man ' ( Tom Drury ) , we know he's a wild savage because he has a long beard , scruffy hair and makes funny noises . Peter rushes to warn his friends but it's too late as the maniac has butchered Craig . Will he be able to save Joanie and Ingid ? It certainly doesn't help when the three become separated . The maniac is in constant pursuit , who will survive and can the murderer be stopped before even more innocent lives are lost ? Directed by James Bryan I loved this film , it's just so entertaining , despite or should that be because of it's faults and all round awfulness . The music grates on your nerves after a while and large chunks of it appear to have been taken directly from an earlier horror film called Frozen Scream ( 1975 ) , the acting is bad and the whole film looks dubbed , the special effects are cheap but that's the way it should be , plus the editing and photography aren't exactly brilliant . The script by Garth Eliassen is great fun . It's never explained where the killer comes from or his motives for killing everyone he meets , and he doesn't say a word throughout the entire film which is just fine with me , who needs a story anyway ? There are so many people running around these ' remote ' woods it's unbelievable , roller skating chicks , artists , bird watchers , tourists , fishermen , ramblers , people making out in the back of camper vans and wheelchair bound cripples who think it's a good idea to travel deep into thick forest on their own ! The so-called twist ending is totally stupid as well , just like the rest of the film so I didn't mind in the slightest ! There are plenty of death scenes , people being hack up with a machete , people are impaled , decapitations , a painful looking death by bear trap , and being thrown off waterfalls , all with plenty of blood and gore , good stuff . Some very funny scenes in this too , like when Peter accidentally stabs a man thinking he is the killer only to keep saying " I'm sorry " over and over as he dies . And the two idiots in the camper van , Dick ( Frank Millen ) and Cherry ( Carolyn Braza ) who has the one of the biggest and crooked noses I've ever seen , and she's so dumb she can't even shut the doors on the camper van properly . A special mention goes to composer H . Kingsley Thurber who is credited with the closing song , to the tune of the ' the teddy bears picnic ' : " Don't go in the woods tonight , you probably will be thrilled . Don ' go in the woods tonight , you will probably be killed . There's a friendly beast that lurks about , and likes to feast , you won't get out . Without being killed and chopped up in little pieces . " You should hear how this guy sings this , it's absolutely hilarious and well worth watching the film all the way through to the end credits alone . Totally impossible to recommend as it's awful , but at the same time I just found it so entertaining to watch . A great ' bad ' film .
497493	1355507	650857	8.0	" How can I prove I don't want to eat you ? " Classic episode .	Monsters : My Zombie Lover starts on the ' night of the dead ' when in a small town the dead return to life as flesh eating zombies , the locals all tool themselves up with guns & go zombie hunting including mom ( Mrcella Lowery ) & dad ( Ed Wheeler ) of two . While out shooting zombies the daughter Dottie ( Tempestt Bledsoe ) decides to stay at home , a short time later there is a knock at the door by a guy Dottie used to know at school named Paul Nichols ( Steve Harper ) the only problem is he was killed in a car accident . Now a flesh eating zombie Paul remembers Dottie & as they spend the night together begin to fall for each other but Dottie's family hates zombies & Paul needs human flesh to live which may be big problems for the relationship in the long run . . . Episode five from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during November 1988 , written & directed by David Misch I have to say that I loved this quirky zombie love story & thought it was a perfectly judged mix of laughs , morals & light hearted chills . The character's really make My Zombie Lover , from the funny young kid who is an anti-zombie killing protester to the all American shoot first don't bother to ask questions later father to the self conscious zombie Paul who is all too aware that bits of himself are falling off ! There's some hilarious one-liners too delivered in a very funny deadpan way like after Paul proposes to Dottie she says ' you don't want my hand in marriage you want it in a sandwich ' in regard to his carnivorous tendencies & after finding true love Paul's exclamation that ' today's the first day of the rest of my death ' had me laughing to the ' I thought you ate my daughter ' line said in total seriousness at the end by the father . Talking of the ending the twist is pretty good too & well as being funny like the rest of the episode . My Zombie Lover is a very funny twisted cross between Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) & Casablanca ( 1942 ) if you can imagine such a thing . The script also tries to deliver a potent social message too & has a thinly veiled dig at racism & American attitudes towards those they fear . Highly amusing & at only just over twenty minutes in length you won't get the chance to become bored . Like many Monsters episodes ( & Tales from the Darkside that preceded it ) My Zombie Lover takes place on a single set with only five cast members so it has a staged in front of a studio audience sitcom sort of feel to it that suits the material perfectly . The monster in this episode is obviously Paul the zombie , while his make-up is alright I've seen better zombie make-up effects although the makers couldn't make him too disgusting since that would have affected the way we the audience felt about him . The only gory moment is when the zombies ear falls off onto the floor . The acting is good although everything is played for laughs . My Zombie Lover is a hilarious twenty minutes that spoofs both the horror & romance genres down to a tee , I thought it worked perfectly & I found it very funny although the other IMDb user ratings suggest I seem to be in the minority ( until now no-one else has rated it over 6 ) .
497487	1355507	650852	8.0	One of the best episodes from the series .	Monsters : Mannikins of Horror ( the IMDb is definitely wrong , the on-screen title says Mannikins rather than Mannequins ) is set in a mental institution where one time brilliant surgeon & inmate Dr . Collins ( William Prince ) resides , Dr . Jarris ( Glynis Barber ) feels she can help him but Collins obsession with the little clay men he sculptures with great anatomical detail including giving them hearts & brains convinces the institute warden Dr . Starr ( Brian Brophy ) that Collins is a hopeless case & beyond help . Starr removes the clay men from Collins room but soon discovers to his cost that that Collins & his creations have a unique bond . . . Episode twenty three from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during May 1989 , directed by Ernest D . Farino & the second Monsters episode to be based upon a story by famed horror author Robert Bloch after The Legacy ( 1988 ) from earlier in the season I am not sure why the word mannequins is spelt so oddly in the title ( as it was in Bloch's original story ) but it's a cracking episode all the same & one of the best from the entire series . I was very impressed with this on both conceptual & technical levels , maybe I'm overrating it but that's how I genuinely feel about it . The story based on one by Bloch had already been adapted & filmed as part of an anthology in the Amicus horror flick Asylum ( 1972 ) & the two share some similarities like character names , the setting & various incidents but feel quite different & I would say this is probably the better version . There's a subplot where it's hinted that it's set in a Government controlled state which doesn't really go anywhere but apart from that it's a terrific piece of horror writing & there's a really good solid intriguing story , some creepy scenes & a great ending which if you know the original story won't be a surprise but I suspect most won't have . One aspect where this version of Mannikins of Horror is far superior to the one in Asylum are the killer puppets themselves which in Asylum were chunky toy like robots that never convinced you they were alive & move about freely while here they are sleek carved men from clay even including genitals for the males ! The special effects used here is stop-motion animation & it works really well & a lot of time was obviously spent on it . In fact this whole episode looks quite high budget & polished with good production values , the sets are good & they are more convincing than usual & there's a certain expansive feeling to this episode as well . There's a couple of good gore scenes as well , someone has a knife stuck in their eyeball in close-up while someone else has their face squashed & mangled . The cast do alright & minor star Glynis Barber does OK . Mannikins of Horror is another excellent episode of Monsters that has high production values & a filmic look , at twenty minutes the story could have used a bit more time but it works very well . Add that to some good special effects , a couple of decent gore scenes & a twist ending you have something a lot better than it has any right to be . I was impressed , an excellent episode .
497240	1355507	104808	8.0	" The network won't even consider it unless unless there's at least three confirmed dead . " Another great Maniac Cop film .	Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence starts where Maniac Cop 2 ( 1990 ) ended with the funeral of the Maniac Cop himself Matt Cordell ( Robert Z'Dar ) . However at the same time a Voodoo priest brings him back to life , with the aid of a little bit of black magic & a severed head . It's just another ordinary crime ridden night in New York as Officer Kate Sullivan ( Gretchen Becker ) responds to a pharmacy robbery where high on drugs junkie Frank Jessup ( Jackie Earle Haley ) is shooting dead any police that get anywhere near him , Kate manages to shoot Jessup but is shot herself by the crooked shop assistant who organised the robbery & badly injured but also manages to shoot & kill the assistant . Two freelance cameramen Bishop ( Bobby Di Cicco ) & Tribble ( Frank Pesce ) capture the incident on film & re-edit it so it appears that Kate shot two unarmed suspects hoping to cause controversy & make lots of money , her close friend Detective Sean McKinney ( Robert Davi ) sets out to clear her name . The Maniac Cop Matt Cordell takes an interest in Kate & starts to kill those wanting to switch off her life support . . . The third , & thus far the last , entry in the Maniac Cop series of films Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence was originally going to be directed by William Lustig but was completed by co-producer Joel Soisson after Lustig walked out , apparently even scriptwriter Larry Cohen voiced a dissatisfaction at how the film ended up . The truth of what actually happened behind the scenes may never be known but it makes you wonder , doesn't it ? While parts of the film don't work as well as they could have I still think Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is a really good horror film . First the negative things , the film never really explains why the Voodoo priest guy brings Cordell back from the dead . He doesn't make Cordell do anything or try to control him so why bring him back ? The ending is very silly , why does the seat Cordell is sitting in not catch fire ? It's not made clear why Cordell takes such an interest in Kate , I think maybe because he sees much of what happened to him in her but the link is somewhat tenuous . Now the positive , Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is well written , a bit different , witty , clever while it also tries to say things & in this regard it has a certain amount of success like city corruption , the importance of money over human life , biased edited for TV news coverage , an uncaring medical profession & the legal right's of a criminal over those of the innocent . It moves along at a nice pace , is never boring & entertains from start to finish . Director's Lustig & Soisson give the film a nice look & special mention goes to cinematographer Jacques Haitkin ( who has worked on over 75 films ) as Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence looks fabulous throughout , from the candle lit Voodoo rituals to the cold , clinical & sterile Hospital interiors this is one great looking , atmospheric & moody film . The gore was disappointing , I have no idea if the version I saw was uncut but apart from a severed head & it's headless body , a few gory gunshot wounds & someone with their face melted there isn't much to speak of . There is a really cool car chase at the end with a burning Matt Cordell behind the wheel of a police car trying to catch McKinney . Technically Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is very good , the stunts at the end are great , the photography is great , I really liked the music & it's generally well made . The acting is pretty strong by all involved & Caitlin Dulany as Dr . Fowler is a bit of a babe & easy on the eye's . I really liked Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence , it lacks a bit of logic but it tries to raise a few issues & have some twisted fun with them . Not as good as the first two entry's but still a great film in it's own right , in my humble opinion . Definitely worth a watch .
498311	1355507	55505	8.0	A top psychological horror from the boys at Hammer .	Taste of Fear starts as a woman's body is pulled from a lake . . . Jump forward two weeks later as a wheelchair bound young lady named Penny Appleby ( Susan Strasberg ) touches down in France , she is met at the airport by Robert ( Ronald Lewis ) her father's chauffeur & is driven to his house . After not seeing her father for 10 years having lived with her mother until she recently drowned he invited her to live with him & his wife & her step-mom Jane ( Ann Todd ) who are now her only legal living relatives , however Jane says that her father suddenly left for work reasons a few weeks ago & has not returned . Penny becomes suspicious when investigating a light in their summerhouse she sees what she thinks is her father's dead body but then disappears shortly after , is Penny losing her mind or is something more sinister going on . . . Also known as Scream of Fear this British production was directed by Seth Holt & is a different sort of Hammer film than one might associate with the studio but is still one of their best films , period . The script by producer Jimmy Sangster is a well written & makes for an excellent & very effective psychological horror thriller . At only 80 odd minutes in length it moves along at a great pace but still manages to develop it's character's & it's engaging storyline . Then there's the really good twists which basically turns everyone & everything on it's head & completely reverses & twists almost everything that has gone before & while one might say what happens is implausible it makes for a terrific film . Director Holt does OK on what was probably a low budget , the film has a simple yet effective style to it & the 50's / 60's decor gives the film a nice look . Some of the sets don't overly convince that your in France all the time & Christopher Lee's French accent isn't great but the film has a nice atmosphere & manages to build up a fair amount of tension & intrigue . Don't expect any gore or violence as there isn't any as Taste of Fear relies on excellent storytelling rather than special effects . Technically the film looks nice enough with clean , crisp & clear black and white photography & generally speaking it's well made throughout . The acting is very good by a decent cast & despite his French accent Christopher Lee is somewhat underused . Taste of Fear is a great film & it's as simple & straight forward as that really , definitely worth a watch & highly recommend if you like your horror psychological .
497355	1355507	681810	8.0	Really fun episode .	Quincy M . E . : New Blood starts as Dr . Robert Asten ( John S . Ragin ) forces Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to take some of his outstanding vacation time . As his replacement Asten calls in pathologist Dr . Jerri McCracken ( Beverly Adams ) who has her hands full straight away when a controversial councilman running for Governor named Lawrence Bridges ( James Callahan ) is found dead , her initial finds suggest a heart attack but the results also suggest that the body had been moved & placed at the bottom of some stairs to make it look like an accident . Learning of the situation Quincy can't help but take a look at the case which irritates McCracken as he insinuates she can't handle it , eventually they decide to work together to discover the truth . . . Episode 18 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by John Peyser & is a really fun episode that I enjoyed a lot & thankfully a huge improvement on the previous story The Winning Edge ( 1980 ) which was terrible . Here in New Blood there's a great story about Quincy getting upset when an attractive woman gets his job while he is on vacation & he gets all sexist & says she isn't up to the job while she argues that she is . These scenes between Quincy & McCracken arguing are a lot of fun actually , then they eventually decide to work together & solve the case . I mean it is Quincy's show after all isn't it ? He ultimately is the one who cracks the case which is fine , he's the star so he gets to solve the crime & get the glory ! Besides McCracken is just a woman , she could never have handled it on her own ! The whole episode is a little sexist actually & I must admit I rather liked that , in today's ultra PC world an episode such as New Blood probably wouldn't get made now . Then Quincy the sly old dog not only solves the case & makes McCracken respect him he actually gets her in the end as well as they both go off on his boat ! Other than the fun plot revolving around the personality clash between Quincy & McCracken there's a pretty good murder mystery here in this episode as well , there are some decent twists & turns & the killer isn't too obvious either so a good fun , amusing , entertaining & enjoyable episode all round really . What more do you want ? Here in New Blood the glamour is provided by pathologist Jerri McCracken & she looks quite nice in a 70's sort of way , I am surprised the production team never asked her to come back as I thought she was a good character & a good foil for Quincy . Bizarrely in New Blood Lt . Monahan puts a pair of glasses on to read a piece of paper which is odd because he has never wore glasses before or since that I can remember so quite why he wears a pair here in this single scene is a mystery . The acting is good as usual , Klugman shines as always while veteran TV actor Dennis Haysbert better known as the President in the series " 24 " makes an early screen appearance . New Blood is a great Quincy episode full of fun & a little 70's sexism that I personally found rather amusing , the murder mystery element of the programme isn't too bad either . Classic Quincy at it's finest .
497360	1355507	681824	8.0	Great Quincy episode .	Great Quincy episode . Rating 8 This comment may contain spoilers Quincy M . E . : Requiem for the Living starts late one night as Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) are finally able to leave the laboratory after a long day & head to Danny's for a game of poker with the boy's . However while in the parking lot Quincy & Sam are taken hostage at gunpoint by mob boss Vincent DiNardi ( John Vernon ) , escorted back into the laboratory DiNardi reveals that he has just found out he is dying from lung disease & has less than twenty four hours to live , DiNardi claims that he has been poisoned & that he wants Quincy to perform an autopsy on himself while still alive to determine the cause of the poisoning & who was responsible at which point DiNardi will order that persons death as one final act of revenge . . . Episode 20 from season 3 Requiem for the Living was the final episode of the third season of Quincy & it was a cracking last episode , directed by Rowe Wallerstein this is yet another story which proves how versatile the premise of Quincy actually was & how varied the stories could actually be & certainly during it's first five or six season were . The main gimmick of Requiem for the Living is that Quincy is ordered to perform an autopsy on a living person rather than a cadaver which is a nice twist & one that the series used a number of times as during the eight season run Quincy autopsied animals including horses & goldfish , Egyptian Mummies , murder cases , suicides & even nothing more than a few bones . I enjoy the crime based Quincy episodes much more than the moralistic ones & it's great that there's a murder mystery element here , there's the personal threat as Sam & Quincy are held hostage at gunpoint & there's even a nice little twist at the end which I for one didn't see coming , the killers motives are not exactly brilliant ( why kill someone who has just brought you an entire apartment complex ? ) but it's only a fifty minute episode , what do you want ? This one has a great pace about it , there's some nice interplay & dialogue between Quincy & DiNardi as he tries to convince Quincy that despite his line of work & who he is he is an honourable man . All in all a great episode that Quincy fans should love . As usual this episode of Quincy is not going to win any awards for style but the terrific story more than makes up for the slightly dull visuals . Set almost entirely in the laboratory , we never actually find out what happens to Chuck the security guard . He isn't shown being rescued so maybe poor old Chuck starved to death tied up as everyone forgot about him & his skeleton is lying around somewhere in the Los Angeles county coroner's office ready to be discovered & have a Quincy like pathologist poke around it trying to figure out if it was murder . . . There's some great casting here as the late prolific John Vernon plays the heavy role he is so good at although I can't decide if I liked him better in Requiem for the Living or the amazingly loopy & brilliant Killer Klown from Outer Space ( 1988 ) , Jack Klugman as Quincy is superb as usual but I come to expect no less from such a terrific actor . Requiem for the Living is an absolutely terrific classic episode of Quincy with a great plot , a solid murder mystery where the victim is still alive & some good twists which help make this one of my favourite Quincy episodes .
499389	1355507	681834	8.0	Top quality classic Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Snake Eyes : Part 1 is set in Las Vegas where LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is attending & pathologist convention , all goes well & once it's over he settles down to enjoy the rest of his stay there with his woman friend Lee ( Lynette Mettey ) . However Quincy's enjoyment is rudely interrupted when he gets a call from the assistant manager of the hotel he is staying in , it turns out that there is some sort of disease sweeping through the hotel & dozens of guests are infected . Quincy does his best to help but people start to die , the hotel manager Al Ringerman ( Val Johnson ) wants it kept quiet to avoid bad publicity while Quincy wants it kept quiet so the other guests don't panic leave the hotel & spread a potentially fatal disease across America so they come to a compromise . Can Quincy discover the cause & find a cure while there's still people left alive to save ? Episode 1 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Joel Oliansky & is a terrific way to kick off the second season . A two part story this first part is classic Quincy , as usual whenever he is on holiday or trying to enjoy himself away from the lab a medical emergency occurs & he has to deal with it as well as contend with the usual bureaucracy & uncooperative officials who only look out for themselves . This is also a departure from the murder mystery stories that littered the first season proving the show could tackle a wide variety of issues & story lines . What I like about this one is that it's not political or one of those horrible episodes with a moral & gives Quincy a good mystery to solve , a race against time & some dead bodies as well . It moves along at a nice pace , the character's are good & even at this point you feel like you've known Quincy all your life . There is also a subplot about a gangster gambling all his money away in a casino & a stand-up comedian who spouts some really bad jokes . This one looks alright , it does look dated at times & some of those hair-dos & suits are just plain frightening . The acting is good from all involved & Danny gets a bigger role than usual in this one . One of the few episodes not to feature either Lt . Monahan , Sgt . Brill , Sam or Dr . Asten . Snake Eyes : Part 1 is a great Quincy episode & sets things up nicely for Part 2 , a must for fans & I'm sure a wider audience would enjoy this too . Perfect afternoon viewing .
496933	1355507	120841	8.0	" Welcome to the maternity ward . . . from hell . " The sexiest alien in the universe is back . . .	Species II starts with the first manned mission to Mars code named ' Excursion ' manned by Patrick Ross ( justin Lazard ) , Dennis Gamble ( Mykelti Williamson ) & Anne Sampas ( Myriam Cyr ) reaching it's destination after 11 months in space . Patrick Ross becomes the first person to walk on Mars , he takes various soil samples & heads back to the Excursion . When back on board some strange slime starts to pour out of the sample cannister . . . Back on Earth the astronauts are treated like hero's but while at a fund raising event Patrick has sex with two débutant's ( Nancy La Scala & Raquel Gardener ) whose stomachs open up & human like baby alien creatures emerge . Patrick asks his Father Senator Judson Ross ( James Cromwell ) for help but is ignored as Judson doesn't want any bad publicity , Patrick continues to create alien offspring using various prostitutes , pole dancers & horny housewives . Meanwhile Dr . Orinsky ( Baxter Harris ) is attacked & killed by Patrick's mutant alien blood & General Carter Burgees ( George Dzundza ) calls in professional hit man Preston Lennox ( Michael Madsen , returning from the original ) & Dr . Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger , also an original cast member ) who has created Eve ( Natasha Henstridge , yet another returnee ) from a frozen alien embryo ( mentioned in the original ) who seems to have a telepathic link with Patrick , but to use Eve's vital ability to it's maximum potential they must turn her almost completely alien . . . Directed by Peter Medak I have to admit I get a real kick out of Species II & I like it more than the original Species ( 1995 ) , I just love the thing & for that I apologise to no one . The script by Chris Brancato moves along at a nice pace & is never dull or boring which is always a good start & it features more blood , gore , sex & nudity than just about any other major studio film I can think of . This is pure exploitation for the modern generation ! Species II knows that it's all about blood & nudity & doesn't shy away from it , in fact it revels in it ! The actual plot is about as silly as you could imagine , it doesn't make a whole lot of sense & is somewhat clichéd & suffers from simplistic one liner type dialogue but what the hell , I just like to sit back & enjoy the bombardment of nastiness that Species II takes great pleasure in serving up . The characters are a bit dumb especially the comic relief black guy & the fat General with one eye but hey , it's all good fun . There are some great gore scenes in Species II , exploding stomachs , a cool effect when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun & it grows back , slimy alien tentacles , a nasty looking cut up blood splattered corpse on an autopsy table , someone has their guts pulled out & lots of blood splattered all over the shop . Species II doesn't skimp on the sex & nudity either as it's all here , a threesome , straight sex , alien sex , a motel complex full of prostitutes , a strip club & rape . Trivia : there is even a deleted scene on the DVD in which Patrick picks up a woman who turns out to be a transsexual so after finding out he breaks her neck . Technically Species II is pretty good , director Medak uses some cool shots like zooming into people's eyes & nice angles like the Star Wars ( 1979 ) rip off start as the spaceship zooms across the screen only this time Medak places his camera above it instead of underneath . The special effects are actually very impressive & hold up well even now & don't forget Species II is over 7 years old & that's a long time in effects development . The CGI is solid & doesn't embarrass itself while Steve Johnson & his team pile on the slime & blood in some great yucky over-the-top scenes . The aliens designed by H . R . Giger look organic & visually cool especially Eve although this is where some of the effects become a little bit ropey . I liked the production design with the contrasting hi-tech labs & the old dark run down outhouse building at the end complete with pulsating purple alien cocoons ! The acting is not going to win anyone any awards but Madsen as the cool hit man Lennox is likable as usual , strangely the gorgeous Henstridge isn't in the film that much & only gets topless at the end but it's worth the wait boys . . . Species II is terrific entertainment as far as I'm concerned , I just loved all the nudity sex & gore , I was in heaven ! Species II has a bad reputation which is fair enough , but to be honest I don't give a sit if anyone else likes it because I did & that's all that matters to me . Great entertainment for those with the stomach but anyone with delicate moral sensibilities should stay away . . .

Five years later and Cropsy is strong enough to leave , the voices of several Doctors inform us that ' the skin grafts just didn't take ' and that he has to try and adjust to a normal life . He walks down some dark sleazy street in New York ( I bet it doesn't look like this anyone ) and is enticed into an apartment by a prostitute . In her apartment she can see how badly burned and deformed he is , at this stage however , we don't . She asks him to leave , he is obviously upset at her repulsion and grabs her throat , picks up a pair of scissors nearby and stabs her , large amounts of blood splat on a mirror . Camp Stonewater is the camp where Cropsy decides to lurk around and extract his revenge . We are introduced to all the main characters . The main counsellors are Todd ( Brian Mathews ) and Michelle ( Leah Ayres ) , they are taking a group of kids on a field trip deep into a nearby forest . Going along are Alfred ( Brian Backer ) who is the creepy weirdo who likes to spy on girls in the shower . Glazer ( Larry Joshua ) is the stud who loves himself , Sally ( Carrick Glenn ) is his girlfriend . Eddy ( Ned Eisenberg ) is the cool ladies man , he's trying to have sex with Karen ( Carolyn Houlihan ) who admits she is sometimes afraid of him . Dave ( Jason Alexander ) and Woodstock ( Fisher Stevens ) are both practical jokers . Tiger ( Shelly Bruce ) is one of various other kids who come along . During the first night Karen has her throat slashed with a pair of garden shears and someone lets all the canoes go . The surviving kids soon realize that their not alone and are in great danger as Cropsy has returned for a murderous revenge . Directed by Tony Maylem this is a solid slasher film from the early eighties . Great musical score by Rick Wakeman , good production values and solid if unspectacular performances help , but the real star of this film is Tom Savini's excellent special make up effects . Including extremely graphic and convincing shots of slit throats , chopped off fingers and limbs , and vicious stabbings . All in lingering close ups . Check the scene out where Glazer is killed , Cropsy sticks his shears through his throat , the tips stick out from his back . Blood spurting all over the place , and Glazer is choking on his own blood which is pouring from his mouth , the gore and violence in this film is brutal and shown in unflinching detail . The biggest problem is the script by Peter Lawrence and Harvey Weinstein , the pacing over the fist half of the film just isn't right . After Cropsy kills the prostitute the films focuses on introducing the characters for too long . It's the best part of 40 odd minutes later before Karen has her throat slit . It gets a little dull waiting for Cropsy to show up again and drags along a bit . Also , at the end when Todd supposedly find Karen's body the filmmakers just use a still shot from her murder , you can even see the tree in the background even though she's meant to be hung up in some abandoned mine of some sort . Overall though I really liked this , it delivers the gory goods and has plenty of nudity as well , what more do you want from a film like this ? As long as it's the uncut version I highly recommend this to horror and slasher fans alike , I enjoyed it .
497374	1355507	82418	8.0	The first Friday the 13th to feature the infamous Jason , solid entry in the series .	Friday the 13th Part 2 starts with the surviving Alice Hardy ( Adrienne King ) having a nightmare about the events of the original Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) in which she beheaded mass murderer Pamela Voorhees ( Betsy Palmer ) with a machete & had a close encounter with her supposedly dead son Jason . It's been several months since the gruesome events at Camp Crystal Lake & Alice is trying to get her life back on track , however her progress is cut short when one night she finds Mrs . Voorhees severed head in her fridge & is then brutally killed by having an ice pick shoved into the side of her head . It's now been 5 years Camp Crystal Lake has been closed & abandoned , the surrounding area is trying to forget about the horrific legacy left behind by Mrs . Voorhees killing spree . Two teenagers , Jeff ( Bill Randolph ) & Sandra ( Marta Kober ) drive into town looking for a new counsellor training centre that has recently opened in the area , just across the lake from Camp Crystal in fact . A old man known as Crazy Ralph ( Walt Gorney ) warns them both that they're " all doomed " , Jeff & Sandra ignore his ramblings & continue on their way . The new camp is run by Paul Holt ( John Furey ) & his girlfriend who doubles up as his assistant Ginny Field ( Amy Steel , apparently her character Ginny Field is named after Virginia Field this & the original Friday the 13th's production designer ) , there is a good turn out & things start well . After some initial light training Paul says that the hard works begins tomorrow & anyone who wants to have a big night out do it now . Half the group go & half stay behind , those staying include the attractive Terri ( Kirsten Baker ) & her unwanted admirer Scott ( Russell Todd ) , Terri's friend Vicky ( Lauren-Marie Taylor ) , a guy in a wheelchair named Mark ( Tom McBride ) plus Jeff & Sandra . But there is someone else there as well , as the rain begins to fall & lightening starts to strike a mysterious hooded figure is stalking the camp brutally killing everyone one-by-one . . . Produced & directed by Steve Miner Friday the 13th Part 2 is a solid entry in the Frday the 13th series of films which have become my favourite horror film franchise & Jason my favourite killer , I have to say that I really missed the iconic hockey mask Jason has for the remainder of the series though as here all he gets is a bag over his head . The script by Ron Kurz is not a huge departure from what has gone before , or indeed since . It isolates a group of typical teenagers deep in the woods & has Jason kill them off in various ways . I found the stalking & slashing in this entry pretty neat , director Miner manages to create some decent tension & a few scares . The script throws in a bit more motive for Jason's killing spree than usual as it suggests that Jason is out for revenge after witnessing his Mother's death & whose head he still has on a table surrounded by candles . But what it basically all boils down to is that these films are all about the kills & they're pretty good in Friday the 13th Part 2 even though it's obvious that they are censored , which is a shame . There's an ice pick in the head , a machete slitting a throat , a double impalement , someone has a hammer whacked into the the back of their head , Jason cuts someones throat with some wire & someone ends up with a machete planted in their face . While none of these murders are particularly graphic I liked them , as usual Jason is unmasked at the end & here he looks like a deformed man rather than the rotting zombie he would latter become . The teenage character's are clichéd for sure but having said that I thought they were surprisingly all quite likable & no one really annoyed me , well except Jeff I suppose but then there's always one isn't there ? The cinematography by Peter Stein in Friday the 13th Part 2 is very stylish & classy , the daytime shots are very rich in colour & the nighttime shots are well lit to create a good atmosphere . As a whole the production values on Friday the 13th Part 2 are above average & it has a nice polish about it . The cool sounding score & especially the main theme by Friday the 13th regular Harry Manfredini is unmistakably Friday the 13th & I think adds a little something all on it's own . Overall I'm a huge fan of the Friday the 13th series of films & this is a good one , while not terribly original it goes about it's job with professionalism & turns out to be an enjoyable slasher . You know what to expect so have a reasonable level of expectation & I'm sure most slasher fans will find something here to entertain & enjoy .
499244	1355507	67017	8.0	" I am sure I am the first such experimenter to incorporate the horror of an actual decapitation with the later rejuvenation of the human body " Pure class .	Dracula Vs . Frankenstein starts in ' Oakmoor Cemetery ' on a dark cold & stormy night as Count Dracula ( Zandor Vorkov ) digs the remains of the Frankenstein ( John Bloom ) creature up . The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas . Jodie Fontaine ( Maria Lease ) is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton ( Lon Chaney Jr . as Lon Chaney ) chops her head off with an axe . The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine ( the director's wife Regina Carrol ) is a headlining act , we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical . Afterwards she discusses Jodie with Sargeant Martin ( Jim Davis ) from the missing persons bureau , Judith doesn't receive much encouragement & decides to investigate Jodies disappearance herself . Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr . Duryea ( J . Carrol Naish ) who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family & now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called ' Dr . Duryea's creature emporium ' which exhibits various freaks . One night Count Dracula turns up & convinces Frankenstein to reanimate the monster . Judith teams up with a guy named Mike Howard ( Anthony Eisley ) , a guy known as Strange ( Greydon Clark ) & his girlfriend Samantha ( Anne Morrell ) & they eventually stumble across the truth , which be honest I don't really understand , & have to fight for their very lives against Count Dracula & his silly looking laser beam shooting ring , both Frankenstein's monster & mad scientist , Groton , a dwarf named Grazbo ( Angelo Rossitto ) & a rapist biker named Rico ( Russ Tamblyn ) , whew what a crazy film & I've barely touched the surface of what happens ! Produced & directed by the infamous Al Adamson I loved this crazy , almost unbelievable film ! You can't really judge Dracula Vs . Frankenstein by standard film criteria , instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch . Dracula Vs . Frankenstein quite literary has everything , it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it's face head on , Count Dracula with a silly looking beard & an afro hairstyle , who talks with a bizarre echo throughout & has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth , a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant , a wheelchair bound Dr . Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard , ancient comets , lab equipment that would look dated during 20's , we do indeed see ( well almost as it's filmed in the horrible day-for-night process ) a Dracula Vs . Frankenstein fight at the end , a biker gang & a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend ! The script is all over the place , the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like " your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood " , or a cop that says " if you've got a fireplace burn some wood in it , it'll be a lot better than running around on the streets " to a bemused Judith , Mike & the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue & lets not forget Dr . Frankenstein's mumbo jumbo " we are not butchers . . . we are scientists " , almost every line is an absolute classic laugh-out-loud moment & I loved all of it ! Dracula & Dr . Frankenstein only meet once in the film & generally speaking Dracula & Frankenstein's monster are relegated to bit-part characters as the film focuses on Dr . Frankenstein's experiments & Judith's investigations , which is a shame . Also , the plot is hardly logical , it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr . Frankenstein's serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires & some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining ? The special optical effects are terrible , check out the laser beam from Dracula's ring . I thought the make-up on the Frankenstein monster was OK & it looked quite freaky . There is some gore , a couple of ripped off arms , some neck biting & a few chopped off heads . There is also one brief shot of female nudity . Technically Dracula Vs . Frankenstein is a bit of a mess , there are some awful day-for-night shots , the performances have to be seen to be believed , the music gets on the nerves after a while , the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff . But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs . Frankenstein just so entertaining & loads of fun , & surely that's what watching films is all about ? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it , but I'm not most people am I ? I'll sign off by saying I loved this film , so bad it's utterly brilliant ! ! !
498378	1355507	78748	9.0	The Sci-Fi horror film that set the standard all others have to match .	Alien starts with the seven crew-members of the huge commercial spaceship the Nostromo being awoken from their sleep . It quickly turns out that the ship's computer named Mother has received a ' transmission of unknown origin ' & has woken everyone to investigate . The crew set off in a smaller craft to the planet where the transmission is being sent from , once there Captain Dallas ( Tom Skerritt ) , Kane ( John Hurt ) & Lambert ( Veronica Cartwright ) don their spacesuits & go to track the source of the transmission down . Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) & the chief science officer Ash ( Ian Holm ) stay behind & co-ordinate things . Dallas , Kane & Lambert discover an alien ship & inside Kane is lowered into a huge chamber full of eggs one of which opens & a creature attachés itself to his face . Back on board the Nostromo Kane is given medical treatment but the creature cannot be removed & it has acid for blood . Eventually the creature seems to come off by itself & Kane regains consciousness & appears fine . However while eating dinner Kane has a fit as an alien creature bursts out of his chest . The crew decide they must arm themselves & the two engineers Parker ( Yaphet Kotto ) & Brett ( Harry Dean Stanton ) manage to come up with some basic weapons , they all quickly discover this alien has grown to an enormous size & is very hostile . . . Directed by Ridley Scott Alien really is just about the best of it's type , period . The script by Dan O'Bannon is a little slow to get going by todays standards but I felt this build up is essential as Scott piles on the tension , isolation & mistrust among the crew before they are systematically hunted down by a seemingly invincible killing machine that is the alien . You feel for the characters of which there are only seven during the whole film which makes what happens even more effective . While the pace may be measured Alien is never boring & it provides terrific scary entertainment , even after all this time I think it still manages to be creepy , frightening & very effective at what it sets out to do . Technically Alien is top-notch , a lot of the special effects hold up very well even today next to all the flashy soulless CGI that fill films up . Obviously a few are a little unconvincing but I can easily forgive this , I mean it was made over 25 years ago wasn't it ? The production design is great as well , Alien doesn't depict it's spacecraft as sterile white & perfectly clean but as something far more realistic , all the dirt , grime & grated floors that look like a mining ship would . Having said that some of the computer equipment looks a little dated even now which along with the slightly slow pace is my only real complaint . The alien itself was designed by H . R . Giger & looks very impressive , very organic & menacing even though it isn't seen that much it's definitely one of the most memorable of all on screen aliens . Director Scott also manages to use sound & music to good effect , I found Alien quite a quiet film which works well . There isn't much in the way of blood or gore , just that alien bursting out of Hurt's chest . The acting is great from all involved & director Scott manages to retain an air of mystery about who will survive as he gives no obvious indication of a hero type character . Alien is a true classic , the chest-burster scene will live on forever & it's a film everyone should see at least once . Watch it as soon as you can .
497696	1355507	280609	9.0	" I hope I give you the shts " Brilliant stuff , ' Werewolves ate my platoon ' , I loved it .	Dogs Soldiers is set in the isolated Highlands of Scotland where a platoon of soldiers lead by Sergeant Harry Wells ( Sean Pertwee ) are dropped off on a regular training exercise . However things take a turn for the worse when they discover a special ops platoon totally slaughtered & the only survivor being Captain Ryan ( Liam Cunningham ) , they are then attacked by Werewolves who kill one of the soldier's . The remaining troops run & luckily run into Megan ( Emma Cleasby ) who all then drive off to the nearest house for shelter , unfortunately the Werewolves destroy their jeep & there are no phones to call for help & they are a four hour drive from the nearest town . Their problems mount as they quickly run out of ammo , the Werewolves start to pick the platoon off one-by-one & as the night draws on their chances of survival seem very slim . . . This British Luxembourg co-production was edited , written & directed by Neil Marshall & I thought Dog Soldiers was a totally brilliant horror film & over several viewings since it first came out has become an absolute fave of mine . The script has a definite sense of humour & doesn't take itself too seriously although it is at heart quite basic with a platoon of under-equipped soldiers stuck in a dangerous situation with monsters coming at them from all directions , yep I've got an Aliens ( 1986 ) with a little Evil Dead ( 1982 ) thrown in there feeling as well , but it never tries to be anything else & taken on that premise , as pure thrilling entertainment , it's as good as anything out there in the horror genre as far as I'm concerned . The character's are perfect & there isn't an annoying American teen in sight , the dialogue is great & these feel like real people as they talk dirty , talk about football & just seem natural & very likable . The film moves along at an almost perfect pace , it keeps on going but it also manages to take the time to develop the character's which makes what happens on screen so much more engaging . The film doesn't mess around with Werewolf film-lore too much & there are some top gore moments . I don't really have anything negative to say about Dog Soldiers , I thought it was brilliant , top-drawer entertainment all the way & it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Marshall does a great job , the action scenes & shoot-outs are cool & he works wonders on what must have been a low budget . The special effects are great & very impressive while I cannot applaud the decision to not use CGI enough , he films the Werewolves with quick cuts & the camera never lingers on them for too long but crucially the action always remains clear throughout & you can tell what's happening despite the quick editing . There's some nice touches here & there , there's a good atmosphere & there are a few good old fashioned scares here as well . There's some good gore here , there's plenty of blood & intestines splattered around , someone is impaled on a branch , someone has their stomach torn open & their guts spill out & there's a nice decapitation in here as well . There's plenty of the red stuff , sorted . Technically Dog Soldiers is better than it has any right to be with surprisingly good effects apart from the exploding toy house at the end & despite being set in Scotland it was actually filmed in Luxembourg not that you would ever know unless someone told you . The acting was very good by an unknown cast . Dog Soldiers is absolutely top-notch stuff from start to finish , sure not every single person out there will agree but films are all about personal opinion & I thought it was most brilliant . Nothing else to say other than watch it as soon as you can . Director Neil went on to make the almost as excellent The Descent ( 2005 ) while according to the IMDb a sequel Dog Soldiers : Fresh Meat ( 2007 ) is currently in pre-production .
497289	1355507	144120	9.0	" You looked in the mirror lately ? Now's not the time to get picky . " Wonderful horror with lashings of dark humour .	Bride of Chucky starts late one night as Officer Bob Bailey ( Vince Corazza ) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the Chucky doll that serial killer Charles Lee Ray possessed way back in the original Child's Play ( 1988 ) . He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex girlfriend Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) slashes Bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer . There Tiffany stitches & staples Chucky ( voiced by Brad Dourif ) back together again & using a ' voodoo for dummies ' book brings him back to murderous life . Thing don't go as Tiffany had hoped & Chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which Chucky is less than happy . While Tiffany takes a bath Chucky escapes , electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride . Neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies . The bodies of Tiffany's neighbour Jesse ( Nick Stabile ) & his girlfriend Jade ( Katherine Heigl ) , who are both on the run from Jade's corrupt uncle Chief of police Warren Kincaid ( John Ritter ) , will do nicely . . . Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky . The script by Don Mancini is great fun , very fast moving , highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection . From the opening sequence where we see Jason Voorhees hockey mask from the Friday the 13th films , Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series & Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise . To the clips used from Bride of Frankenstein ( 1935 ) when it virtually recreates the same scene . Bride of Chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well , there are lots of one liners , self referential gags that Scream ( 1996 ) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general . I love the scene when Jesse & Jade are having a clichéd slushy romantic conversation that Chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout . That's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is . Director Yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun , both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause . Technically Bride of Chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25 , 000 , 000 I should hope so . The only thing that I will say is that some of the puppet effects by Kevin Yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing , I can't remember any CGI scenes in Bride of Chucky either . Thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat , nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a Hellraiser ( 1987 ) homage , people impaled on shards of glass , someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck , a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots . The acting is pretty good & Dourif as Chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out . I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear , I can't be the only one surely ? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic film , total entertainment from start to finish , great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull . A personal favourite of mine , watch it as soon as you can !
497185	1355507	82694	9.0	" All the juice I can carry . . . " Top notch Post Apocalyptic action .	Mad Max 2 is set in a post apocalyptic Australia after World War III has left the landscape a barren wasteland ruled by thieves , murderers , scavengers & general scum . Max ( Mel Gibson ) drives along in his V-8 Interceptor with his dog trying to keep out of trouble & simply survive , gasoline has become the new currency & is in short supply so when Max stumbles upon a small community who refine gasoline & have loads of it he tries to do a deal with them to fill his car up & get as much juice as he can carry . However a gang of thugs & killers lead by Lord Humungus ( Kjell Nilsson ) want the refinery for themselves & will kill to get it , Max becomes involved & agrees to help the community out . . . This Autralian production was co-written & directed by George Miller & was the second in the Mad Max trilogy of films & in my humble yet worthwhile opinion is easily the best of the three . The script by Miller , Terry Hayes & Brian Hannant is a fantastic action flick from start to finish , it's a ' pure ' & ' raw ' action film in the sense there's a simple yet effective story in which the makers have crafted some truly exhilarating stunts & actions scenes around . The character's are surprisingly well developed & fleshed out considering there is actually very little dialogue with Max himself a man of few words , this works well though . The film moves along like a rocket at 95 odd minutes there's barely time to catch your breath before the next explosion or car chase . I loved it from start to finish , the explosions , the car chases , the wanton destruction , the vehicular mayhem , the violence & there's even a very good story here as well . I watched this last night on cable TV & the announcer said ' Now it's Mad Max 2 which contains strong language & violence ' then he paused for a few seconds & then in a very self assured voice said ' It's like Waterwolrd but better ' ! He was right on all counts & this is just an absolute top action film without any one-liners , silly romances or stupid sub plots that get in the way & slow things down . Director Miller obviously used the experience he gained on the original Mad Max ( 1979 ) on this sequel & improved everything along with making the explosions bigger & the stunt work better , the stunt work is amazing without any CGI computer effects in sight . Everything was done as a physical stunt on set & it looks brilliant , the final chase with the truck & the gang has to be maybe my favourite vehicle chase ever . There's lots of individual scenes which are just works of art in the action film genre in Mad Max 2 , there is also one of the biggest explosions your ever likely to see on film at the end as the compound is blown to ( very little ) pieces . I don't know how I can praise it more to be honest . Then there's the wonderfully realised post apocalyptic setting , obviously a lot of Australia is a barren wasteland so in that regard it was shot in the right place but the costumes , guns , crossbows & vehicles just look right & haven't dated at all , if Mad Max 2 came out this week it would still look good & futuristic . I'm not sure about the homosexual tone some of the gang members have though . There isn't much graphic violence but there's enough here & the amazing stunt work more than compensates . There is one queasy scene though when Max eats a can of dog food & seems to be enjoying it a little too much . . . This was apparently the most expensive Australian film made up to that point & it shows with terrific production values . It's very well made with impressive sets & the already mentioned fantastic stunt work . The acting is as what it needs to be , Mel Gibson who wasn't a big star at the time does a decent job . Mad Max 2 is a fantastic old school action flick where stunt men & women actually put their lives on the line to produce some spectacular action scenes unlike these days of course where it's all computer effects so in that regard I doubt we'll see another film like it . Absolutely brilliant & it's one of my all time favourite action films .
