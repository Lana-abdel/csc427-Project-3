498293	1355507	260162	1.0	By the time a character in The Mangler 2 says " useless piece of American garbage " you'll know exactly how he feels , absolutely awful film .	The Mangler 2 starts with a rebellious teenager named Jo Newton ( Chelse Swain ) being sent to a private school by her displeased billionaire Father ( Ken Camroux ) after breaking into one of his hi-tech computer lab thingy's & hacking the main computer , or something like that . Headmaster Bradeen ( Lance Henriksen ) holds a school assembly ( consisting of about 50 students ) to inform everyone that while they have been away on their spring break the school has been fitted out with the latest computer system called M2K from ' Newton Industries ' that will safeguard the students needs & safety . As it happens everyone is going away on a geography trip , everyone that is except the five head prefects , Jo , Dan Channa ( Will Sanderson ) , Corey Banks ( Miles Meadows ) , Will Walsh ( Dexter Bell ) & Emily Stone ( Daniella Evangelista ) who have to stay behind because of a practical joke played on the schools website which ' degrades ' the school & it's pupils . Bradeen specifically accuses Jo so as revenge she downloads a virus called the ' Mangler ' & infects the schools brand new computer systems with it . Before long Bob the maintenance man ( Jeff Doucette ) has been murdered by the schools computer as it decides to kill everyone currently within it's walls . . . Written & directed by Micheal Hamilton-Wright The Mangler 2 has no connection to the previous Tobe Hooper directed The Mangler ( 1995 ) & is truly one of the worse films you will ever have the opportunity to witness . It's absolutely abysmal on every conceivable level you care to think of . The script is so slow & boring it could probably put most people into a coma , Bob the maintenance man isn't killed until the 36 minute mark so that means there is 36 painful , dull , uneventful & frankly god awful minutes before anything that even approaches horror takes place . Up to this point it's just totally unnecessary chit chat & character development that instead of making the viewer care about these people does exactly the opposite , I hated every single annoying , unfunny spoilt brat in The Mangler 2 & it's been a while since I've hated every character in a film . I mean take Jo for instance , besides being a sort of anti-hero she is always in a mood but what has she got to be in a mood about exactly ? Her Father's a billionaire , life can't be that bad for her surely ! So you just sit there hoping they will be killed off in very painful ways , well you can forget about that as almost all of the murders , of which there aren't many anyway , are off-screen , incredibly dull & bland . There is no gore in The Mangler 2 just a burned guy & a few splashes of blood , really that's it , in fact there isn't an effect in The Mangler 2 that you couldn't create at home with a bit of fake blood . From a technical point of view it ain't bad but the direction sucks , director Hamilton-Wright fails miserably to create any tension , atmosphere , scares or anything that resembles entertainment . How can a computer control things which aren't electrical like a washing machine lid or a wheelchair ? How can it makes wires come alive & wrap themselves around people ? How was this film ever allowed to get past the script stage ( if there was a script ) ? Why are the characters so dumb ? Why don't they just stand out in the open where there are no electrical appliances ? Why do they split up & constantly argue ? Why don't they just walk out of the door instead of having to run across the roof ? Why has no one got a mobile phone ? Doesn't everyone have mobile phones these days ? The unbelievably mushy ending when the annoying character who started it all in the first place finds a new found appreciation for her Father & they both live happily ever after just compounds the fact that I wanted to slit my wrists after suffering 90 odd minutes of this crap , Micheal Hamilton-Wright bow your head in shame ! A quick word about the acting , first everyone's terrible & really unlikable . Second , oh dear what on Earth was Lance Henriksen thinking ? ! This piece of straight-to-video , or maybe it was made-for-video ? , turgid rubbish really blots his copybook as far as I'm concerned . A special mention goes to the highly irritating & annoying techno music that director Hamilton-Wright insists on abusing our ears with . According to the IMDb The Mangler 2 had an estimated budget of $4 , 000 , 000 , all I can say is that where did the money go because it's a cheap looking film with few effects & actor's . Currently almost 70 % of the votes on the IMDb give it 1 star which it fully deserves & I honestly can't see what anyone would get out of The Mangler 2 in terms of entertainment . Apparently there is a yet another sequel called The Mangler Reborn ( 2005 ) at which I shudder at the mere thought . There really is nothing that I can compliment The Mangler 2 on , it is one of the very worst films it's been my misfortune to endure & generally speaking it is just an astonishingly bad film that I hope you never have to sit through & if you already have then I feel your pain . . .
498428	1355507	113349	1.0	" He's so blasted he wouldn't know his own mother even if he went to the zoo . " Absolutely terrible .	Howling : New Moon Rising starts out in the open Californian desert as a police Inspector ( John Ramsden ) is faced with the skeletal remains of a man near the isolated locale of Pioneertown . Not only does he have to deal with skeletal remains he has to listen to Father John ( Jack Huff ) who works for the Church investigating supernatural & occult goings-on , Father John claims the man was victim to a Werewolf & that very Werewolf is about to mature into adulthood at which point it will be able to change other's into Werewolves & thus spreading it's race throughout the country . Meanwhile in Pioneertown a stranger named Ted Smith ( Clive Turner , I will come back to this guy later . . . ) has arrived , Ted finds the locals very hospitable as the owner of ' Happy Harriet's ' gives him a job as a barman & they also let him have a room in their motel . However it quickly transpires that Ted may not be what he at first seems as some of the locals begin to become suspicious of him , for instance who was that drunk ( Brett Owens ) who seemed to know Ted & threatened to ' expose ' him for what he really is ? What do the locals of Pioneertown really know about Ted & can they trust him . . . This English production ( at this point I'm embarrassed to be British ) was edited , written , produced , directed & starred Clive Turner who really should never be let anywhere near a film camera again , ever . Howling : New Moon Rising was the seventh , & to date last , film in the Howling series that began with The Howling back in 1981 . The best parts of Howling : New Moon Rising are the bits edited into it from two previous entries , Howling IV : The Original Nightmare ( 1988 ) & Howling V : The Rebirth ( 1989 ) which probably amount to a good 10 or so minutes . The script also tries to tie these films together & even mentions the events from the previous instalment Howling VI : The Freaks ( 1991 ) . Now , as a horror film fan you have to be able to take a chance on a film that you have never heard of but will probably turn out to be complete & utter crap , it goes with the territory . Sometimes you will come across an absolute gem , while other times you find a film that will pass the time reasonably enough & then there's films like Howling : New Moon Rising which are the cinematic equivalent of having your trousers pulled down & having a large vegetable inserted into your rectum . Now I've had my fair share of cinematic vegetable insertions but every once in a while a film comes along so utterly awful that I wonder why I bother , Howling : New Moon Rising is such a film . It is devoid of any entertainment value whatsoever , just take my word for it this deserves it's pathetically low score on the IMDb . Director Turner makes one of the most awful films ever . There is no excitement , tension , atmosphere , blood or gore except in the scenes stolen from the other Howling films & the Werewolf in this one is on screen for all of 30 seconds & I kid you not . Add that to the fact that it's one of the most pathetic looking creations I've seen in a horror film for sometime & this really isn't much of a Werewolf film at all . Then there's the country & western music & the cringe inducing line dancing scenes , don't get me wrong I have nothing against either of these forms of recreational entertainment but here they are just plain embarrassing as every so often the film goes into a line dancing or musical number . The cowboy type clothing , hats , boots & general talk is , quite simply , embarrassing & frankly hideous . There are also elements of comedy like penis size & fart jokes , well I'd didn't find much to laugh at . Going straight-to-video technically Howling : New Moon Rising is rubbish , from the lame story , the unfunny comedy , the naff cowboy character's , the terrible special effects , the lack of any blood or gore & to cap it all off the acting is awful including editor , writer , producer & director Turner who has shoulder blade length hair & silly facial hair . This film is really bad & I've seen some absolute stinkers in my time , it even ends on a nice ' happily ever after ' country & western singalong as the credits rolls . There is not one single aspect by which I could recommend Holwing : New Moon Rising to anyone , avoid at all costs & you have been warned !
497537	1355507	439309	1.0	There are bad films & then there's Swamp Zombies .	Swamp Zombies starts as a FBI inspection of his Hospital forces misguided scientist Dr . Phillips ( Shannon Solo ) to call in his shady contacts to quickly dispose of his unethical experiments into the re-animation of the dead . Unfortunately they dump the cadavers into the nearest swamp ( looks like a lake to me ) & think the job is done , however these corpses were injected with Phillips re-animation serum & , surprise surprise , come back to life as rotting flesh eating zombies ! A student field expedition will provide plenty of fresh meat , can the local kick boxing Ranger Jack ( writer , producer , director & coward Len Kabasinski hiding from embarrassment under the pseudonym of Leon South ) save the day & can Dr . Phillips bizarre experiments be stopped ? Starring , written , produced & directed by the aforementioned Len Kabasinski there are films which are so bad it's untrue , then there's the celluloid abomination that is Swamp Zombies . This is quite possibly the worst film I've seen since the last worst film I saw , seriously though Swamp Zombies has made it into my prestigious worst ever films list & boy have I seen some stinkers in my time , to gain a place on this list a film has to have certain qualities , a certain type of badness , it has to be a so mind-numbingly bad film as to make me want to me poke my eyes out & Swamp Zombies has those unique , hard to achieve qualities . For a start the character's are awful , to call them one-dimensional & bland would be too kind , the dialogue is terrible as for some reason these people can't seem to string a proper sentence together , it's an absolute bore to sit through with a predictable & clichéd ' plot ' although I use the term plot very loosely , all the zombie attacks are virtually the same & end up with the human character's having a karate fight with them , however on the plus side Swamp Zombies might just be the best horror / zombie / martial arts film ever made , not that I can think of any others mind you . Then there's the fact that Swamp Zombies lasts for more than two hours ! Jesus Christ almighty , how the hell did I make it through two hours of this cinematic turd ? I could go on all day about how bad this is but that would be silly so I'll just say I hate Swamp Zombies & I hate every single aspect of it , it's as simple & straight forward as that . This is one of the worst directed films I've ever seen , there's virtually no direction at all . No-one puts any effort into anything & they just sort of either stand there or jog depending on the scene , the scene when the old man is first attacked by the zombies & runs through the wood waving his arms in the air letting out a little wailing noise is hilarious & the bit when a fat redneck guy comes face-to-face with a zombie & he says ' oh my god ' like he was asking someone to change the channel on the TV . There's also another fight scene set atop a car park where it starts out during the day & after a few punches have been thrown it's pitch black . There's absolutely no scares , there's no tension or atmosphere & most of it is shot during the day with lame scenes of people practising kick boxing on the zombies . There's no real gore either , there's the usual blood splattering but no proper graphic gore effects & the zombies themselves look awful . With an ultra low $12 , 000 budget it shows , I don't wish to be unkind but Swamp Zombies is nothing more than a glorified home film & has the production values to match . This is just terrible in every respect including the acting which is awful . Swamp Zombies is possibly the worst film I've ever seen , I'm sure no-one sets out to make a bad film but when it's this bad & we have to spend our hard earned money & time watching it it's difficult to cut it any slack or have any sympathy for the filmmakers . I hated it , plain & simple .
497657	1355507	74434	1.0	Awful horror film , the sort of film the fast forward button was invented for .	This film opens with the on screen caption " on August 10th in a California Drive-In it all began . . . " A young couple are murdered while sitting in their car at a drive-in watching a film , by an unknown psycho with a large oriental sword . Two fat cops Mike and John ( James Barnes and Micheal Alden ) are put on the case , but unfortunately when it comes to solving the crime and capturing the killer these guys are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard . They interrogate a few people connected with the drive-in , Germy ( Douglas Gudbye ) the all round dogsbody , and Atkin Johnson ( Newton Naushaus ) the hilariously bad tempered and foul mouthed manager . This leads to a funny conversation between the two cops and Atkins , Atkins says teenagers are dicks and one of the cops replies " well , I have two of them " referring to the two dead kids from the opening sequence , the other cop quickly buts in and says " teenagers that is ! " , funny stuff and it doesn't end there . The cops helpfully observe " well , she's in pretty bad shape , she was murdered with a sword " and when they want to talk with Atkins again one says " lets go get that bald headed garbage can ! " Anyway , they are baffled , the only lead they have is a man named Orville ( Norman Sherlock ) who hangs around the drive-in and spy's on people in their cars having sex , but when questioned by the two cops he claims he had nothing to do with the killings and he says " I just wanted to beat my meat ! " , hey that's what the guy said . All their leads come to dead ends . Will the two cops be able to unmask the killer in time , before more innocent lives are lost ? Co-written , produced and directed by Stuart Segall this is just plain terrible . The acting is awful as is the photography and music . There are a couple of good gore scenes , a decapitation , a slit throat and an impaling , there just should have been more of them . But that's nowhere near a good enough reason to sit through this rubbish . The script by George ' Buck ' Flowers and John F . Goff is slow , dull , boring and predictable . There's a scene where the two fat cops stakeout the drive-in , in disguise . One of them dresses in drag , he looks ridiculous and then they start to have a stupid conversation about where he's going to pee ! There is also another scene where two victims are watching an unknown film in their car , the guy says " what a turkey ! " and " this plots been done before " , you will know exactly how he feels , I also wondered if his dialogue was included by the filmmakers as a little self referring joke , it sums up the film well . Half the film appears to be padding , there's a five minute sequence in which Germy walks around a funfair for absolutely no reason whatsoever , among other pointlessly drawn out scenes . The ending is also one of the worst ever , nothing is concluded . One to avoid . This does have a great tag line on the video cover though , ' You'll pay to get in . . . and pray to get out ! ! ' , that's true enough , you'll pray to get out alright , just way before this thing finishes .
497741	1355507	884237	1.0	Absolutely dreadful pseudo computer game masquerading as a horror film .	Carnivorous starts as Kate ( Leah Rose ) gets a flat tyre while driving in some isolated woods somewhere , soon after a guy ( Chris Flieller ) comes along in a truck & abducts her after knocking her out with a shovel . Kate wakes up to find herself tapped inside what looks like a huge labyrinth that is populated by awful computer game graphics , sorry I mean scary ten foot tall monsters . Along with various other people Kate has to survive the various traps , dodge the monsters & try to find a way out of the maze like labyrinth & to the safety of the real world . . . Written & directed by Drew Maxwell I watched Carnivorous last night , I actually had the choice of watching this , Southern Comfort ( 1981 ) , Kiss the Girls ( 1997 ) or Saw II ( 2005 ) & I definitely made the wrong decision since Carnivorous is one of the worst films it's been my displeasure to endure . At the time of writing this comment Carnivorous has a lowly User Rating of 1 . 8 on the IMDb & I am wondering why so high ? Also at the time of writing this comment there is only one other User Comment & it starts by asking the question ' Why such a low IMDb rating ? ' , well it has such a low rating because it's truly dreadful . It's abysmal . It's appalling in every aspect . It's an awful film , if you can describe it as a film , & it's as simple & straight forward as that really . I have no connection to the film industry , I had never heard of Carnivorous before I watched it , I don't know anyone involved with the film & the director & producer & actor's are just ' names ' to me & I didn't see it at some obscure film festival with an introduction by the director which is all it takes for some people to rave about the biggest pieces of celluloid crap imaginable . I am just an average guy & I cannot understand or see how anyone could find anything in Carnivorous even in the remotest bit enjoyable or entertaining . Both conceptually & technically Carnivorous is appalling . The story is weak , the character development is none existent , the plot makes no sense , there's barely any exposition , it's impossible to care about what is going on & it's unrelentingly dull & boring to boot . Definitely one to avoid . A lot of Carnivorous was shot in a warehouse against a green-screen & the backgrounds & monsters were digitally put in later & the process looks terrible . The perspective is all wrong , character's just don't look right or stand right against the poorly rendered & detailed backgrounds which look awful . It's so dark you can barely see anything , the lighting is all wrong on character's face's & bodies , the CGI monster look terrible & the average PS3 console game looks better with more convincing graphics . Carnivorous is like a poorly made video game but without the fun of the interaction , you just sit there looking at these awful CGI graphics & praying that it's going to finish sooner rather than later . The film has a really odd look & feel , your brain just know's that something is wrong , that something isn't quite right in the way character's walk around or the perspective of certain shots & it's a very odd viewing experience . There's not much gore either , there's a decapitated , an impaling & a cut head but nothing else & all the actor's obviously were working without any on set props & these scenes just don't work as the CGI animators try to match the live action & the CGI but pretty much fail on every occasion . I have never seen another film quite like Carnivorous & I genuinely hope it's a one off & filmmakers don't go down the cheap CGI route not only for backgrounds but sets & props as well . According to the IMDb this had a supposed budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 , yeah right ! Knock at least three zeros off that & I think that would be nearer the true budget . The film has no scares , the lighting is well off , the CGI backgrounds are far too dark & look terrible & the whole film seems to try & go far a Hellbound : Hellraiser II ( 1988 ) feel with it's Gothic style hellish labyrinth complete with dangling hooks on chains but the CGI is awful . The acting is terrible too from no-one I have ever heard of . Carnivorous is a truly terrible film , it's absolutely dreadful & deserves it's lowly IMDb rating . This is definitely ' worst film ever ' material & I would hate to think the techniques used here to make Carnivorous would become widespread in the industry . One of the worst films I have ever endured & I have endured some real rubbish over the years .
499149	1355507	346811	1.0	" We just landed on monster island . " Awful , awful , awful , avoid at all costs .	The Curse of the Komodo starts on an isolated island near Hawaii as an army special forces operation is secretly taking place which ends up with them all being killed by a huge genetically engineered Komodo . The army have gotten cold feet over the experiment & orders the project leader Professor Nathan Phipps ( William Langlois ) & his assistant Dr . Dawn Porter ( Gail Harris ) back to the island to destroy all evidence of the experiment that was designed to produce huge genetic mutations to used as weapons against the enemy . . . Meanwhile thieves Drake ( Paul Logan ) , Tiffany ( Melissa Brasselle ) & Reece ( Cam Newlim ) make good their escape in a chopper after robbing a casino but they run into bad weather & their pilot Jack ( Tim Abell ) has to land anywhere he can & in one of the film only type coincidences they land on Komodo island . They meet up with Phipps his daughter Rebecca ( Glori-Anne Gilbert ) & Porter who are protected by armed guards Jason ( Jay Richardson ) , Hanson ( Ted Monte ) & Blake ( J . P . Davis ) . Things quickly spiral out of control as the huge Komodo begins to systematically eat everyone in sight , will any of them survive ? Directed by Jim Wynorski as Jay Andrews The Curse of the Komodo is one awful creature feature & just a downright terrible film . The script by Steve Latshaw is predictably rubbish , the rules for this type of film aren't hard to follow are they ? You have your isolated location & stranded monster food , there's the giant dinosaur , genetically engineered creature or alien or whatever to eat the cast members one-by-one & the corrupt military involvement to introduce lots of guns & weaponry , simple right ? Well not to Mr . Latshaw & Wynorski as The Curse of the Komodo fails in every department , there isn't one positive thing I can say about this film . The character's are boring cardboard stereotypical clichés the least about whom the better . The Komodo barely does anything & why did the military create giant Komodo lizards in the first place ? Maybe they could have genetically engineered a huge hamster or something docile & cuddly , it would have been easier to control if anything went wrong , right ? The film is really slow , dull & very boring as it's over forty minutes before the Komodo even shows up ( not counting the opening sequence ) . The attack scenes are dull , unexciting & repetitive as the giant Komodo just stands there as our cast of humans just shoot at it for what seems like ages as their guns never run out of ammo . I have an intense dislike for films like The Curse of the Komodo , it's boring , poorly written & it's a film of absolutely no redeeming qualities . If the military had no conscience about napalming the island why didn't they do that to start with instead of sending in two scientists ? It would have saved a lot of time , trouble & pain for everyone involved especially us the poor viewer having to sit through this crap ! Director Wynorski has made over sixty of these low budget horror / sci-fi films & to be fair he knows how to make a film , unfortunately he doesn't know how to make a good film . The special effects are terrible , the plotting is awful , the logic is absurd , it rips off various other films & as a whole The Curse of the Komodo is seriously crap . Forget about any sort of gore or violence , the Komodo only eats one person on screen & even then just to their legs . Technically the film isn't too bad but it's all rather bland & forgettable . The acting is pretty bad & I didn't think the women were good looking enough either , Anne Gilbert gets her breasts out but that's about it . The Curse of the Komodo is total rubbish , it provides no entertainment value whatsoever & there are far better creature feature films out there . This is not a sequel to & has nothing to do with the film Komodo ( 1999 ) which is far better than this . According to the IMDb Komodo Vs . Cobra ( 2005 ) directed by Wynorski is in post-production , I shudder at the mere thought of it .
497081	1355507	681788	1.0	When is an episode of Quincy not an episode of Quincy ?	Quincy M . E . : Has Anbody Here Seen Quincy ? sees Los Angeles coroner & chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) having car trouble , he just can't make it into work . Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) exasperated , he then gets a visit from the chief coroner Dr . Hiro ( Yuki Shimoda ) who Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) has personally asked to perform an autopsy on a body flown in from Italy which he suspects is being used to smuggle millions of dollars of diamonds into the country . As Dr . Hiro runs around trying to sort various problems out things get more & more complicated . . . Episode 7 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Steven Hilliard Stern & I really hated it , in fact it's one of only two Quincy episodes I would never watch again . First lets take a look at the title which is in the form of a question , Has Anbody Here Seen Quiny ? Well actually yes , in fact I would go as far as to say that I have seen every episode of Quincy that was ever made more than once so the answer to the question is a definite yes . When I sit down to watch an episode of Quincy I expect at the very least to see Quincy involved in some capacity & usually he always is , however the one exception to that rule is Has Anybody Seen Quincy ? since Quincy doesn't appear in the episode at all & as such this episode has the distinction of being the only one in the entire eight seasons not to feature Jack Klugman as Quincy except during the opening titles . So there's no Quincy , right . Instead we get a annoying little Japanese coroner who speaks very slowly often in silly little proverbs & phrases with an irritating accent . Not pleasant . This guy isn't even second rate Quincy , he's more like twentieth rate Quincy . When I want to watch an episode of Quincy I expect him to be in it , if I didn't want to watch an episode of Quincy I would just turn the telly over / the DVD off so the fact the production team give us a Quincy free episode is neither here nor there . Dr . Hiro is awful , Quincy is fantastic . Dr . Hiro in an episode equals crap , Quincy in an episode equals entertaining . Here Dr . Hiro gets caught up in several bitty little sub plots none of which are particularly interesting , a young boy is poisoned by cigarette butts ( how , you can't get poisoning from sucking on a cigarette butt otherwise everyone who has ever smoked a cigarette would be dead ) , a woman who was brought into the morgue but wasn't dead is never explained ( I mean how did the Hospital pronounce her dead in the first place ? ) & capturing some diamond thieves for the LAPD even though he doesn't actually do anything & the thieves come to him . I am not happy about Quincy's situation either , I mean Los Angeles as a city isn't that big you know & besides hasn't he ever heard of the bus ? Or the train ? Then again he does have two legs that he can walk on doesn't he ? He didn't have to miss the whole day , he could found his way into work & put in a few hours , right ? Most of the regulars have a fair amount of screen time but none more so than usual , the guy who plays Dr . Hiro is awful & his jive talking chauffeur is irritating . Has Anbody Seen Quincy ? is right down there with the very work Quincy episodes ever made , it's awful & doesn't feature Quincy which for me is an absolute minimum requirement for a Quincy episode . This Japanese Hiro guy doesn't even make a decent replacement , to me this isn't an episode of Quincy .
496919	1355507	273057	2.0	Rubbishy horror / thriller / mystery type thing .	Jon Good's Wife ( simply one of the worst titles for a film ever ) , or The Red Right Hand ( another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing & has no relevance to the film ) under which I saw it , is set in ' Salem , Massachusettes 1978 ' ( incidently the year I was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days ) where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion , gay-boy fagot Roger Mather ( John Kuntz , is that surname for real ? Just say it out loud . . . ) , Martha Alden ( Kim Brockington ) , Rebecca Lawson ( Jenna Stern ) & her boyfriend Jake Stabler ( John Doe ) , Alan Hobbes ( Michael Kevin Walker ) & his wife Sandy ( Megan Rawa ) plus John Good ( Marc Ardito , why is the spelling of ' John ' different in the title ? ) & his wife Sara ( Abigail Morgan ) . From the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air & when someone mentions their ' missing ' friend Calef ( Jason Winther ) lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back . Then comes the phone calls , the mysterious nose-bleeds , hallucinations & guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light . . . Produced , executive produced & directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the thing & Kurt St . Thomas who gets the art direction credit too & if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well ! Personally I thought Jon Good's Wife was awful , I mean she can't cook or anything ! Ha ha ha , only joking ! Seriously though I didn't think much of the film overall , for a start it's pretty slow going & the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other & dull character building exposition . The film never explains itself , what's with those weird nose-bleeds for god's sake , the mysterious phone calls , the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural & what the hell was Sara all about ? She comes across as some nosey , sex crazed , dirty talking , shameless , bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets ! Some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno & it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror / thriller it was supposedly meant to be . Then there's the ending , if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever I have yet to see it . The whole thing was very predictable as well , I mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend Calef went ' missing ' there wouldn't be more to it ? Directors Gioscia & Thomas make an infuriating film , on top of the predictability & annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by Alan which I simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else & at what point in time is he narrating from ? The reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon . There's no tension because the whole things so by-the-numbers . Technically the film is OK but nothing special & some of the locations & clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me , this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's . The acting was alright & what about actor John Kuntz last name ? I suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of Kuntz , right ? ! I really didn't think much of Jon Good's Wife ( a blow up doll would have been better ! Ha ha ha ) & I'm not sure who it would appeal to . Forget about any gore , horror , violence , scares , atmosphere or excitement , in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here . Not recommended .

Swamp Devil starts as city girl Melanie Blaine ( Cindy Sampson ) gets a phone call from a guy named Jimmy Fuller ( Nicolas Wright ) who claims to have known her when they were young children in Melanie's home town of Gibbington , Jimmy pleads with Melanie to come back to Gibbington to see her father Howard ( Bruce Dern ) who is dying . Although Melanie hasn't been in Gibbington for twenty odd years she feels she should make the effort to be with her father so she drives up there where she discovers that her father Howard isn't dying at all & in fact he is wanted for the brutal murder of a teenage girl . The local Sheriff ( James Kidnie ) & a posse of local men are on the hunt for Howard who is hiding out somewhere in the vast local swamps & marshes , Melanie decides to stick around to find her father but there's more going on that at first appears . Was all the crazy talk of monsters living in the woods by Howard just trying to shift the blame from himself or is there more to it than that ? This Canadian production was the third & to date final Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' directed by David Winning after he had previously directed the equally awful Something Beneath ( 2007 ) & Black Swarm ( 2007 ) , unfortunately it's not so much a case of third time lucky as third time even worse than the first two . I suppose in broad terms one could say Swamp Devil is a cross between Swamp Thing ( 1982 ) with it's similar sounding title & similar looking monster made from swamp weed or branches or whatever it is & A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) with the central concept of a brutal child murderer being killed by vigilantes ( including the local Sheriff ) & coming back for revenge although one also has to say that Swamp Devil is as bad a cheap ' Creature Feature ' as you can imagine . I have seen so many of these things I am beginning to wonder why I bother watching them as they are all generally awful from rubbish scripts that are very predictable & make no sense ( there's absolutely no explanation whatsoever as to why or how the killer was resurrected as a Swamp Thing rip-off , there's no reason given as to why it can't cross the county boundary & there's no reason why it hasn't already killed Howard ( I mean he's been running from this thing for twenty odd years ? Why didn't he just move house ? ) ) to clichéd cardboard cutout character's ( a typical local Sheriff , one character who know's about the monster but no-one else believes them ) to forgettable dialogue to yet more truly awful CGI computer effects work that render any of the scenes with the monster laughable . The pace is slow , the film is boring & apart from some dull mystery elements that are easy to work out Swamp Devil really doesn't have much , if anything , going for it . The one thing that might have saved Swamp Devil was some good solid exploitation but unfortunately this is pretty much PG rated stuff all the way with only one scene featuring any blood when someone has possessed vines poked through his leg & shoulder very briefly , otherwise Swamp Devil doesn't feature a single drop of blood . The CGI computer effects are mostly poor , the actual Swamp Devil creature itself when seen looks terrible & has very awkward stiff animation although I will say the possessed vines effects are quite good . The end is very poorly shot & edited with the viewer having to guess what is going on most of the time . There's nothing scary here & apart from the opening & closing sequences it's set entirely in the day which doesn't help the atmosphere , I mean a nice dark spooky swamp at night would be a perfect place to set a horror film but during the day it just doesn't have the same sort of ominous feel . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 one wonders where all the money went , there's an exploding pick-up truck at the end but apart from that nothing happens & you can't tell me those CGI effects cost that much . Although set in the deep south in the US this was filmed in Montréal in Québec in Canada . Most of these ' Creature Features ' have at least one name actor & here it's the turn of the Oscar nominated Bruce Dern , Cindy Sampson as Melanie does alright & it helps that she's quite hot . Swamp Devil is another faceless Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' the likes of which sort of melt into one another , basically if you have seen a few of these ' Creature Features ' before then you have seen Swamp Devil & the lack of any sort of gore or explanations for the events contained within doesn't help matters .
499237	1355507	65727	2.0	" Police speculate that this bizarre crime is the work of a psychopath . " Fantastic title for a terrible zero-budget horror film .	Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport , ace reporter Dan Carter ( Harry Kerwin , he is also credited as production designer ) phones his mate Ed Casey ( Phil Philbin ) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he has been investigating Carl Schuman ( Doug Foster ) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed . Schuman meets Dr . Elaine Frederick ( Veronica Lake , she also executive produced ) who has recently been released from a mental institution , together they discuss their grisly plans . The news of Cater's death has reached Casey & he decides to take the story up himself & do some investigating , well actually he gets his secretary Viginia Day ( Marth Mischon ) to do most of the investigating & just report back to him , lazy bugger . Virginia informs Casey that they have someone on the inside named Kristine ( Heather Hughes ) since Dr . Frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses , Kristine reports back to Casey about Schuman & Dr . Frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh & specially cultivated maggots . . . Co written , co-produced & directed by Brad F . Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts . First lets start with the script by Grinter & Thomas Casey who was also responsible for the cinematography ( you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job ) , basically it's terrible . The character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality , I didn't like anyone in this film . For what it's worth I quite like some of the ideas here , the flesh-eating maggots , the basement laboratory , stealing bodies from a hospital & that unforgettable ' twist ' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own . Unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written , stiff & unnatural sounding it's untrue , I mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they " won't let us out of the house " which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking OUTSIDE in the garden to someone . No thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth , in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing Dr . Frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either ! Even at an extremely short 68 minutes long Flesh Feast is very slow & dull , the poor editing doesn't help with scenes & shots lasting for far too long , for example there is a scene in which an Ambulance pulls up outside a Hospital , drives up to the doors , the guy gets out , he walks to the back doors & opens them etc . etc . did we really need to see every single detail ? There is also another sequence in which Dr . Frederick enters room & puts some gloves on , then she takes them off walks into the opposite room & puts another pair on ! I personally think that Grinter probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up . I do like that bizarre ending though , I really do . Technically Flesh feast is complete crap , I'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small , very small . Just about the entire film takes place in one house , Dr . Frederick's laboratory consists of a table , some plastic beakers & test tubes , some ancient looking electronic medical equipment & a strange screen with funny colours on it ( don't ask ) . The cinematography is poor , the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed , badly dubbed too . The exploitation elements are also disappointing , there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than wriggle a bit , there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg sawn off & a OK looking dismembered corpse & limbs hanging on hooks . The acting is awful from everyone concerned , & I mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse . Do yourself a favour & avoid Flesh Feast , yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments & that ending is , well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film-making that quickly becomes painful to watch . I doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting , I can tolerate just about anything but even I considered switching it off . Definitely one to avoid , you'll be pleased you did & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned !
499101	1355507	95889	2.0	Pretty bad haunted house horror film .	After the spooky events of Poltergeist ( 1982 ) and Poltergeist II : The Other Side ( 1986 ) Carol Anne ( Heather O'Rourke ) now lives in a high-rise apartment block somewhere in Chicago with her Aunt , Patricia ( Nancy Allen ) her husband Bruce Gardner ( Tom Skerritt ) and his daughter from a previous marriage Donna ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) . Carol Anne is attending a school for infant children with emotional problems , run by Dr . Arthur Seaton ( Richard Fire ) . Strange things start to happen , mirrors crack for no reason and a ghostly apparition begins to appear . Soon this ghost takes Carol Anne , Donna and one of Donna's friends named Scott ( Kipley Wentz ) to the other side . A dwarf named Tangina Barrons ( Zelda Rubinstein ) turns up and tells Pat and Bruce where Carol Anne is and how to get her back . But this ghost won't let her go easily . Bruce and Pat must fight dark forces to save themselves and their family . Co-written and directed by Gary Sherman I thought this was a waste of 100 odd minutes of my life . The script by Sherman and Brian Taggert is about as dull and uninteresting as you could hope for . Nothing exciting or in the least bit scary happens at all , a few lights , a bit of mist / dry ice and some failed attempt at spooky noises & voices . There's no gore to speak of , just a couple of dead bodies and a stupid scene where someone bursts out of another's body . On the positive side it's competently made and to be fair the second half moves a long at a fair pace , although the love conquers all ending is unoriginal and far too predictable . There's not much else to say , don't bother with this one as there are much better films out there worthy of your attention .
498530	1355507	118604	3.0	" I don't know what kind of friend this jerk is to you but he ate my spleen . " Absolutely terrible sequel to the original classic .	An American Werewolf in Paris follows the fortunes of three young American tourists , Andy ( Tom Everett Scott ) , Chris ( Phil Buckman ) & Brad ( Vince Vieluf ) who arrive in Paris where Andy decides he wants to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower , whatever turns you on I suppose . They hide in the Tower & when the coast is clear Andy rigs his bungee cord up but as he is about to jump he hears footsteps belonging to a attractive young woman named Serafine ( Julie Delpy ) . Serafine also wants to jump off the Tower but for a different reason to Andy , to commit suicide . Serafine jumps & Andy throws himself after her & manages to catch up with her on the way down , grab her & deposit her on the ground without leaving a single scratch on her while he recoils back & knocks himself out on a beam . When he comes round Andy is determined to find her which doesn't take long as she just happens to be a nurse at the very same hospital he has been taken too , gee what a coincidence . Andy pesters her for a date to which Serafine eventually agrees , Andy quickly falls in love with her & when one of her friends Claude ( Pierre Cosso ) says Serafine will be at a club that night the three friends go . However Andy soon discovers that Serafine is a Werewolf & her friends are Werewolves , Andy is drawn into a underground world of Werewolves & a sinister plan to overthrow mankind using a serum which lets those infected turn into a Werewolf at any time . . . Executive produced , co-written & directed by Anthony Waller I think An American Werewolf in Paris fails miserably at just about everything that it sets out to achieve . The script by Waller , Tim Burns & Tom Stern tries to be many things & ends up as a complete mess . First it tries hard to be a comedy with lots of stupid inappropriate slapstick that isn't funny in the slightest , Andy knocking himself out on a beam , a Doctor emerging from a room knocking Andy to the ground , a zombie trying to whistle & their eyeball popping out , a bumbling cop & a scene in a café where Andy blows a condom up in front of Serafine because it's supposed to be bubble gum . It also tries to mix in horror elements with the Werewolves , massacre of American teenagers , rotting undead zombies , human hearts in blenders & mad scientist serums . There are also brief snippets of action in here as well with a psychically impossible bungee jump from the Eiffel Tower , a few shoot outs , plenty of hand to hand fights & a chase through a train . An American Werewolf in Paris fails to combine these genres effectively , everything feels out of place , very awkward & odd especially if you have seen the brilliant original An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) which is vastly superior to this in every possible way . I was never quite sure what I was supposed to be watching , whether I was supposed to be laughing , screaming or on the edge of my seat & in the end I did none of these things at any point . An American Werewolf in Paris moves along at a fair pace & at it's most basic provides sporadic glimmers of entertainment but not packaged into one coherent film . The characters are dumb & unlikable , the words stereotype & clichéd come to mind . One more thing is it true that everyone in Paris speaks English but with a French accent ? With a budget of about $22 , 000 , 000 An American Werewolf in Paris is technically OK but the special effects aren't the best & the Werewolves themselves look like the fake CGI computer graphics that they so obviously are , Rick Baker's Oscar winning animatronic & puppet effects in the original look far better even with a 17 year gap in special effects development between the two films . The gore is tame by comparison to the original as well , just a few severed limbs , a few boring Werewolf attacks & a couple of rotting zombies , yawn . A word about the music which I hated , full of rock & rave type crap director Waller once again tries to pander to the teenage audience along with he casting of handsome teenage leads who can't act . Because An American Werewolf in Paris flirts between lame comedy & lame horror it fails to build any sort of rhythm or atmosphere either way & almost comes across two different films pasted together , by a chimpanzee . Forget about this pile of crap & watch the original again instead & remember how great a film that is . Definitely one to avoid .
498202	1355507	264675	3.0	" At least they didn't blow up the toilets like last year . " Terrible low budget slasher .	Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader starts late one Halloween night , also the eve of a big football game , as local high-school caretakers George & Earl remove dead animals hanging from the sports field goalposts , put there as a practical joke by some people who obviously have no sense of humour . However George comes across a bag which contains the decapitated head of a cheerleader named Patricia Bertwood . It's not long before head cheerleader Heather Connelly ( Tasha Biering ) is told the distressing news over the phone by cheerleading coach Elaine Riley ( Debbie Rochon ) , they are somewhat shocked but figure the show must go on . Shortly after putting the phone down coach Riley is murdered . . . Back at home with Heather & the phone calls start , phone calls from the killer who taunts her , scares her & warns her not to set foot outside of her house . Meanwhile three more member's of the cheerleading squad , Molly ( Noelle Manuel ) , Violet ( Beth Hunt ) & Rose ( Amy R . Swaim ) meet gruesome ends at the hands of the axe wielding killer . Heather receives more phone calls informing her of her friends fate but who is responsible ? Her boyfriend Danny ( Daniel Justin Roach ) ? Her jealous & possessive ex Chris ( Andre Walker ) ? Or maybe the local drunk Joseph Hatterman ( Bob Carter ) who has a very dodgy history ? Written , produced & directed by Jeffrey Miller Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a pretty poor film on all accounts . The script obviously takes it's inspiration , or steals it's ideas whichever way you want to put it , from better films from this genre like Scream ( 1996 ) & Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) & unfortunately doesn't do a very good job , it can't even match them let alone surpass them in an already overcrowded sub genre . For most of it's 80 minute duration Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a very uninspired clichéd slasher , think the worst Friday the 13th clone you can & mix it with a right out of nowhere a similar to Scream twist ending which seemed over elaborate but at the same time was surprisingly effective . If the start of the film had built up to this ending better than Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader could have been a decent little film but it comes from absolutely nowhere & just doesn't feel like it belongs to the preceding 70 minutes which are throughly routine & not especially enjoyable . The character's are awful , the dialogue is poor with some really bad red-herrings spread throughout that just don't work although at least there is a fairly steady stream of victims & it's quite short . Director Miller hasn't got a clue how to make a horror film . There is no build up to any of the murders they just suddenly happen which means there is no tension or potential for scares whatsoever . He has no idea how to set a mood as in one scene as Heather is having a ' emotional ' chat with her ex boyfriend Chris his choice of music is bizarre as he uses a tune that would be more appropriate during a murder scene . There are a few murder's but nothing that memorable , a couple of women have their breasts cut off with an axe , someone gets an axe in the head , there is quite possibly the worst looking severed foot I've ever seen , a couple of decapitated heads & a hammer stuck in someone's head . There is some nudity as well which is nice but no actual sex scenes . The budget for Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader must have been minuscule , I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say that 90 % of the film takes place in Heather's front room & house ( that ' don't go out ' warning from the killer was there to save money then ) & it becomes highly irritating . The shot on video photography is point shoot & hope for the best stuff while the special effects are anything but special . The acting is pretty poor , but then did I really expect anything else ? Head Cheerleader Dead Cheerleader is a throughly rotten attempt at a slasher film , apart from from a clever & surprisingly effective climax which deserves to be used in a better overall film there is absolutely nothing to recommend here . Stick with the likes of Friday the 13th , The Burning ( 1981 ) , My Bloody Valentine ( 1981 ) & Scream for decent slashers that deliver the goods . Not worth your time or money .
499382	1355507	451187	3.0	Pretty bad , ineffective psychological horror film .	Room 6 starts normally for Amy ( Christine Taylor ) & her fiancé Nick ( Shane Brolly ) just like any other day of the week until he proposes to her , on their way home that afternoon they are involved in a car crash where Nick injures his leg . Help soon arrives & Nick is taken away in an ambulance along with the sister of Lucas ( Jerry O'Connell ) who were also involved in the accident , however neither Amy or Lucas are told which Hospital their loved ones are taken too . Amy & Lucas both head for the nearest Hospital but they know nothing of who they seek , in fact they phone all the Hospital's in the local area & none of them seem to have admitted Nick or Lucas's sister . Where are they ? The police won't help them & they have to find them on their own , but where do they even start ? Co-written & directed by Michael Hurst Room 6 seems to be one of those films which divides opinion having looked at various other reviews & comment on it from around the internet & the IMDb , personally I'm firmly in the camp that dislikes it . The script by Hurst & co-producer Mark A . Altman takes itself very seriously & starts off promisingly enough with an intriguing premise that grabs you , unfortunately it all falls apart as it goes all weird with scenes that make no sense in context with the rest of the film , the character's are poor , the dialogue not much better & then there's the terrible ' twist ' ending which had me reaching for the ' off ' button on my remote , as soon as the credits started to roll it was pressed . To my eyes it never tied things together properly or with any great satisfaction , it all left me rather unmoved & the fact that it's pretty slow going doesn't help either . I think the length might have been a problem as well , to fill out a 90 odd minute feature film the filmmakers obviously had to pad the simplistic story out , it relies on it's ' twist ' ending for it's impact & a lot of what goes before just seems pointless , I think overall Room 6 would have been so much better if it was a tight little 30 odd minute Tales from the Crypt ( 1989 - 1996 ) episode , then again thinking about it Room 6 & the 90 minutes I spent last night watching it would have been much better if it had never been made . . . Director Hurst doesn't do anything special , it's got cheap TV film written all over it . It's all rather flat , bland & forgettable . He goes for psychological horror rather than in your face horror , unfortunately the story is weak , the ' twist ' at the end is poor & as a whole I found it all very unsatisfying & a bit of a waste of time . Forget about any violence or gore as there isn't any . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 Room 6 is an average production at best , I'll probably have completely forgotten about it by the end of tomorrow . The acting was poor , I never cared for anyone & again since the ' twist ' ending relies on you doing so so much the film suffers . Room 6 is one of those films which seems to think having a clever ' twist ' ending is all that matters , unfortunately Room 6 doesn't have a clever twist ending . I pretty much hated it , definitely not recommended .
497775	1355507	396938	3.0	Another masterpiece from DeCoteau , not .	Witches of the Caribbean starts late one night on a picturesque Carribbean island where a young guy named Dino ( Owen Steuart ) hears someone calling him , he wanders around trying to find out who but a mysterious cloaked figure rips his heart out . . . Professor Avebury ( Joanna Cassidy ) runs a program for troubled teens & has decided to hold sessions on a Caribbean island , perk of the job I suppose . Avebury's last guest has just arrived , Angela ( Nicole Cavazos ) who has been suffering from a recurring dream of a witch being burned alive 100's of years ago . Angela is introduced to everyone , Bethany ( Nicole Marie Monica ) , Clara ( Kelli Giddish ) , Enid ( Nina Tapinin ) , Cutter ( Micael King ) & Jerry ( Kyle Jordon ) . Bethany is a self proclaimed witch & befriends Angela , she influences her & reveals to Angela that they share the same dream . As the dream becomes more & more vivid Angela changes , Bethany twists the facts & convinces her that only she can help her . But what is Bethany's motivation , how come she appears to have magical powers & what sinister plan does she have in store for the vulnerable Angela ? Directed by David DeCoteau I thought Witches of the Caribbean was a poor attempt at a horror film . The script by Janna K . Arnold is simplistic , unoriginal & doesn't really interest . At points the film is OK & it moves along at a fair pace while at other's it becomes mind numbingly tedious to sit through . The story itself about a reincarnated witch isn't anything particularly new & Witches of the Caribbean does nothing to distinguish itself apart from the location but even then that was probably chosen so the filmmakers could have a nice holiday in the Caribbean for a few days , it's nice work if you can get it ! The cast is made up entirely of teens most of whom annoy & the climactic showdown at the end is pathetically staged & I'm pretty sure I could have done a better job , if that wasn't bad enough DeCoteau then has the nerve to make us watch one of those predictable throwaway sequel driven twist endings . Overall there is very little by which I can recommend Witches of the Caribbean as there are so many more better horror films out there . Director DeCoteau has over 50 low budget sex / horror films to his ' credit ' , he usually hides under a pseudonym ( in some case under a woman's name ) so for him to put his real name to this I shudder to think of the quality , or lack of , of the other films he's made . There is no excitement , atmosphere or scares but I have to give him some credit for assembling a fine looking cast of young ladies . . . There are one or two gory moments all revolving around people having their hearts ripped out . Going straight to video , where it belongs I might add , Witches of the Caribbean was filmed in the Turks & Caicos Islands wherever they are & amazingly , according to the IMDb , was shot between 14th December 2003 & 19th December 2003 ! It took five days to shoot this ? What took them so long ? It's also interesting to note that it sat on a shelf for two years before being released in ' 05 . As a whole it's reasonably well made considering the budget , shooting schedule etc . There is quite a catchy pop tune as part of the soundtrack which I found myself liking . Again , a mention for the ladies whom are all very easy on the eyes especially when they get the black goth look going . Witches of the Caribbean is watchable at best & that's being generous . At least it doesn't last for very long & isn't as bad as some low budget straight to video crap that I've sat through lately . You could do worse , but not much , but you could do better , a lot better .
497519	1355507	126816	3.0	" Your sunglasses are the only protection you have from all the white out there . " Bad made-for-TV action flick .	Blackjack starts as former FED Jack Devlin ( Dolphh Lundgren ) is called in by his brother to protect his young daughter Casey ( Padraigin Murphy ) with good reason because shortly after an attempt is made on her life , luckily Devlin is pretty much bullet proof & hard as nails so a heavily armed gang of mercenaries is no problem although one throws flash grenade which temporarily blinds Devlin but simply not being able to see isn't enough to stop Devlin killing all the bead guy's & saving his niece . However the attack has left Devlin with a phobia , he is afraid of the colour white which is a bit of a problem . Anyway , when his former FED buddy Tim Hastings ( Fred Williamson ) is shot while protecting a supermodel client named Cinder James ( Kam Heskin ) Devlin takes over the operation & sets about finding out who wants to kill Cinder & stopping them , obviously . . . This made-for-TV American Canadian co-production was surprisingly executive produced & directed by John Woo who deserves better than this & one wonders why he made Blackjack straight after the big budget futuristic action flick Face / Off ( 1997 ) , to me it seemed like a step backwards although having said that his next film after Blackjack was the big budget Tom Cruise flick Mission : Impossible II ( 2000 ) so I can only assume he made this over a couple of weekends to pass the time . Anyway , the script by executive producer Peter Lance is to be blunt tripe . For a start it's unoriginal , it's predictable , it has very low key action scenes & set pieces , bad dialogue , clichéd character's & it's dull . Then there's this nonsense about Devlin being afraid of the colour white , I'm sorry but I was like sitting there thinking so what ? It's hardly the most exciting plot device in the world is it ? The only reason it's original & hasn't been used in any other film is because it's such a stupid notion nobody ever wanted to use it before . The scene when the bad guy gets away because he drops a large white sheet down in front of Devlin is hilarious & stupid in equal measure as is the fight in a huge pool of milk . The bad guy's motives suck , the script takes itself very seriously & there are no one-liners or wisecracks to lighten the tone & there's no chemistry between any of the character's either . Director Woo is on autopilot here , sure there are maybe a couple of decent motorbike stunts but apart from that there's some shoot outs with his traditional slow motion shots there but very little else , it's certainly not exciting & where do I get some of those razor sharp playing cards that Devlin has ? Devlin is hard , in fact he's so hard he even has a butler who wears an eye-patch . . . You have every right to expect better from Woo . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 Blackjack had a much bigger budget than I first thought although Lundgren was paid $2 , 000 , 000 & the film looks like what it is , a low budget made-for-TV action flick , there's no style or substance here at all although it's well made for what it's worth . The cast are alright although Heskin never convinces as a supermodel in either looks or acting department . Fred Williamson is wasted in small cameo . Blackjack feels like something Woo made during his weekends , I don't really understand what anyone would see in it as it's not exciting & it's action scenes are below average .
499139	1355507	67140	3.0	I didn't like it at all & it felt like it went on forever .	Giù la Testa is set in Mexico where Irish IRA explosives expert John Mallory ( James Coburn ) is on the run from one revolution & fight but soon finds himself in the thick of another when he teams up with Mexican bandit Juan Miranda ( Rod Steiger ) & his gang , Juan forces John to help him & his gang rob the gold from a bank in the city of Mesa Verde using explosives but soon both are considered hero's for their antics . Drawn into the revolution Juan & John become important figures & commit themselves to the cause against oppression & their capitalist leaders . . . More commonly known amongst English speaking audiences under titles such as A Fistful of Dynamite & Duck , You Sucker ( worst title for a film ever ) this Italian production was co-written & directed by Sergio Leone & despite the whole world & it's brother seemingly liking it I personally hated Giù la Testa & it's as simple & straight forward as that . When originally released in the US Giù la Testa was heavily edited to a little over two hours & I thought it was that shorter version I was going to watch last night but due to a mistake the version I saw was the life sapping two & a half hour plus cut which bored me to tears , hell I was sat there watching this & for the last hour all I could think to myself was how much more of this crap do I have to sit through . I know Giù la Testa has a good reputation but I really saw nothing here to enjoy or recommend , I thought the tone was very uneven , I thought the plot was weak & could be more accurately described as a collection of loosely connected incidents , I thought the themes about revolution , war , redemption , running , honour , family & betrayal had little dramatic impact & it bored me stupid . I can't stress enough how bored I was watching Giù la Testa & the worst sin a film can commit in my eyes is to be boring . The film has a few sporadic moments of action , there's a few explosions , some shoot-outs & a crashing train but they are few & far between . Despite what anyone says the violence is tame , there's no blood or gore for instance . I will give Giù la Testa some credit for it's nice production design & cinematography , the film certainly looks nice if nothing else but that's not really enough . I mean if something bores you to tears it doesn't really matter how good it looks , does it ? I don't quite understand where all the love for Giù la Testa comes from , I honestly didn't enjoy it at all & after a fairly striking opening thirty odd minutes I found myself losing all interest in it & becoming increasingly bored . It's never a good sign when you sit there & just keep saying to yourself that you wish something would just finish ! Although set entirely in Mexico Giù la Testa was filmed almost entirely in Spain apart from some studio work in Italy . As I have said the film is visually nice with some nice cinematography but it's just so dull & boring . Rod Steiger & James Coburn make for decent leads . Giù la Testa is a film with a good reputation that I hoped I would enjoy but at over two & a half hours it bored me half to death , nope I am sorry but I don't have any love for Giù la Testa at all . I am sure there is an audience out there for a film such as Giù la Testa but it's not for me .
498095	1355507	117688	3.0	Really bad sci-fi action flick .	Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip , joining them is a robot named Solo ( Mario Van Peebles ) who can use any weapon ever made , is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being . Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden ( William Sadler ) isn't happy about , back at base & General Haynes ( Barry Corbin ) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed . One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it . . . This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful . The script by David Corley was based on the novel ' Weapon ' by Robert Mason & is one cliché after another , robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop ( 1987 ) , Universal Soldier ( 1992 ) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator ( 1987 ) . This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people , at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people , sounds like Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ) to me . The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it . You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free ( thank god I didn't spend any money on it ) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said ? My TV guide described Solo as a ' dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels ' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo . In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head , I mean it's a sci-fi action film , it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire . Enough said really . Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot . So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right ? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a ' self destruct ' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened ? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time ? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong ? The violence is mild , there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really . Technically the film looks alright & is competently made , it was actually shot in Mexico . The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red ( 2000 ) edited footage from Solo into that film . The acting is poor , Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot . . . William Sadler deserves better than this , it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2 : Die Harder ( 1990 ) . Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop , Universal Soldier & the Terminator films . Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch . . .
498648	1355507	257510	3.0	The sequel that nobody wanted , at least it's not as bad as Tobe Hoopers original .	Four heavily armed men wearing balaclavas burst into the ' Arizona Millennium Bank ' and proceed to rob it . Before they can escape the police turn up and the following shoot-out ends in a massacre of both police and innocent customers . The four robbers manage to escape unharmed . Then it's off to ' Orange County Airport ' . One of the stewardess on flight 211 to Accapulco named Mia ( Heidi Lenhart as Heidi Noelle Lenhart ) talks to her boyfriend , Zach ( Chuck Walczak ) who's already there sunning himself by a pool . Mia says she'll be there soon . The four bank robbing murderers from the opening sequence , Max ( Darryl Theirse ) , Sol ( Jon Sklaroff ) , Squid ( James Parks ) and Pete ( Billy Reick ) are also going to Accapulco on flight 211 , and manage to smuggle guns , ammunition and stolen money on board . Crocodile 2 was obviously made before a certain date that will go down in history . Julie ( Anna Cranage ) is the other stewardess . As they fly , the plane encounters awful weather conditions , a violent thunder storm . The pilot ( Dan Martin ) is told to turn back . Max , Sol , Squid and Pete are rather unhappy about this and hijack the plane . Max and Squid burst into the cockpit and force the pilot to carry on to Mexico . Sol and Pete try to keep the passengers under control , to prove his point Sol shoots a kid in the face called Sean ( Sean Euro ) . Hearing the gunshot Max and Squid are distracted in the cockpit and the pilot and his co-pilot ( Eddy Chamichian ) sense their chance and try to disarm Max and Squid . In the ensuing struggle the planes instruments are damaged and the plane crashes in ' Devils Swamp ' , somewhere in Mexico . Max , Sol , and Squid survive . As does Julie and Mia , plus the obligatory teenager Brian ( Steve Moreno ) , a lawyer named Justin ( David Valcin ) , a nurse ( possibly Rachel Henry who is listed as ' injured passenger ' , the filmmakers don't even bother to give her an on screen name ) and the pilot . Max convinces the survivors to carry their stolen money across the swamps to a village named Santa Christo , by pointing guns at them and shooting the already injured nurse dead , because she will slow them all down . The pilot is suddenly attacked and killed by a crocodile . Max and Co . shoot the crocodile dead . They all head off into the swamp . A massive crocodile finds it's mate floating dead on the surface of the swamp . It sets out for revenge . First of all it eats Julie . Meanwhile , in Accapulco Zach has heard about the plane crash on the box . He hires Roland ( Martin Kove ) to help him track down Mia who he believes may still be alive . They manage to find Mia , and the rest of the survivors . Zach and Roland are then also thrown into the situation and have to survive the killer crocodiles constant attacks . Will they be able to make it back to civilisation or possibly be rescued before they all end up as crocodile food ? Watch it to find out ! Directed by Gary Jones this isn't a particularly great film but is a lot better than Tobe Hoopers original Crocodile ( 2000 ) . The script by Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch , who both helped write the screenplay for the original , is split in two . The first half is a bank heist film , the robbery and the plane hijack . The crocodile doesn't appear until after the 45 minute mark and then the film becomes a pretty straight horror for the rest of it's run time . The ending is a bit stupid and I'm not entirely convinced that what happened would be possible in reality . The script features a silly amount of bad language , in fact it becomes extremely irritating as the bad guys have to swear every couple of words . It's reasonably well paced and mildly entertaining for what it is . This is a film where the script probably looked half decent , unfortunately the filmmakers didn't really have the money or dare I say it , the talent to make it work . I mean the plane crash probably sounded cool as the written word but the finished sequence ended up rather lame with poor special effects , the same could also be said for the fight Roland and Max have in a helicopter as it flies over the swamp . The special effects are mixed , they range from awful to OK but their generally better than the original's . There's not much gore , but the attacks all contain a fair amount of blood . Most of the actors are forgettable except Martin Kove who is pretty watchable and doesn't deserve to be reduced to making films like this . Not particularly good , but it just about kept me entertained for 90 odd minutes on a certain level .
498196	1355507	339288	3.0	Really awful low budget horror film , real life leeches don't suck as much as this .	Leeches ! is set in & around ' Lakecrest College ' somewhere in California where lately hunky dude Jason ( Josh Henderson ) has been having disturbing nightmares . Together with his girlfriend Casey ( Stacey Nelson ) they come to the conclusion that the steroids he has been taking may be responsible , you see Jason is aiming to get a swimming scholarship & has been taking steroids supplied by his best friend Stevo ( Matthew Twining ) . It's not like the rest of the swimming team aren't taking them is it ? As Stevo & Jason take a dip in a river blood-sucking leeches attach themselves to their backs & start drinking . They eventually discover the leeches & pull them off but don't kill them . . . Having drunk steroid loaded blood the leeches mutate into , well , bigger leeches . As an important swimming contest fast approaches Stevo puts pressure on another team member named Tony ( Stephen Swan ) to take a whole bag of steroids for even better performance , unfortunately Tony ends up in the river where even more leeches feast upon his blood which has a seriously high steroid content . It's not long before Lakecrest College is overrun with giant blood-sucking slimy mutant leeches & the students are on the menu . . . Co-produced & directed by David DeCoteau , who according to the IMDb also has a small uncredited role in the film as Franklin the Walkie Talkie Voice ( ! ) , Leeches ! is a very poor film throughout . The script by Michael Gingold could have been decent fun as a creature feature type horror but instead it's just lame , it's boring & has no depth as it skates over & all but ignores the drug usage issue . The character's are awful , the dialogue sucks & everyone is one dimensional teenage leech food & wouldn't you notice or feel a huge mutant leech crawling up your naked back ? It's one of those films which has an outrageous premise & promises so much but in the end I simply couldn't wait for it to end , speaking of the end there's a ' twist ' which comes from nowhere & seemed totally pointless . The body count is low & the leeches themselves are far from scary or threatening , in fact the real leeches used at the start are more effective than the stupid rubber ones . Leeches ! was one of two films director DeCoteau made during ' 03 , the other being Speed Demon ( 2003 ) , so you can probably guess the sort of time & commitment spent on Leeches ! First of all it's true what everyone says about Leeches ! , DeCoteau uses & films as many half naked young guys as he can . I can't remember a shot where a guy actually had a shirt on to be honest , constant shots of young men in their speedos as DeCoteau's camera can't get enough of it ! Surprisingly this was shot in a 2 : 35 : 1 aspect ratio ( basically you will have thick bars at the top & bottom of the screen if you see it that way ) which could have given DeCoteau the opportunity to make a nice looking & stylish film , he obviously passed the opportunity up . The violence & gore is as restrained as possible , someone coughs some blood up , a few leech bite marks & a decent bit where a wire slices through someone's throat . For some bizarre & highly annoying reason DeCoteau films the weak attack scenes with quick cuts & with strobe lighting effects which happen during the attack's but not before or after , the words cheap ' n ' nasty spring to mind . With a budget that probably wouldn't cover a round of drinks Leeches ! is a pretty shoddy production that was probably made with the video / DVD market in mind . Low production values , really poor special effects as the leeches themselves are mostly just glove puppets & are only filmed from half way up their bodies & Leeches ! just has that cheap vibe throughout . Leeches ! is a pretty poor film , to it's credit it's short & it moves along at a fair pace although generally speaking it's just poor . If you enjoy looking at half naked young guys then Leeches ! is definitely for you , if you enjoy a good horror film then Leeches ! definitely isn't for you .
498108	1355507	681871	3.0	Moralistic Quincy with plot holes galore .	Quincy M . E . : Unhappy Hour starts as two drunk teenager lovers Leonard Miller ( Ross Rhodes ) & Melody Stedman ( Karlene Crockett ) crash their car on a dirt road , both are thrown clear of the wreck & Leonard is killed . The next morning & Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) orders coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to swap jobs with him for a few days to prove a point , the first body on Asten's autopsy table is Leonard & Asten quickly learns that his niece Melody is being blamed for the accident that killed him . Unable to prove conclusively who was driving Asten talks to Melody's friends & discovers that she is an alcoholic while her parents put pressure on him to sweep any findings that may implicate Melody as the driver under the carpet . . . Episode 16 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & not only takes the moral high ground has plenty of plot holes . The Quincy production team were obviously keen to promote & raise serious moral & social issues using the flexible format of the show & here they turn their attentions to underage drinking & alcoholism . For what it's worth I agree with the basic stance the production team make & that alcohol is as dangerous as any other addictive drug & merely because it's legal , unlike say heroin , doesn't mean it's safe unless it's used responsibly . Those sentiments are fine & commendable , it's just when the show gets so preachy & heavy handed the entertainment values drop like a lead balloon . Quincy just isn't fun when it's off on one . Unhappy Hour tries to have a mystery element as well since the driver of the car remains a mystery but this subplot is very flawed , at the end of the programme some insurance guy uses a computer to recreate the accident & what happened exactly . I am no expert in law but a theoretical crash devised by a computer would get laughed out of court , there are too many variables that no-one could know . The speed the car was travelling at , the angle it hit the mound of dirt , what initially caused the car to hit the dirt ( did it swerve , was there a mechanical fault , did the driver just lose control ) & the indisputable fact that no computer in the world could definitely work out when the door opened which is the biggest variable of the lot & one crucial to determining what happened & who was driving . Also the crash at the start didn't look anything like the insurance guy's reconstruction either . Unhappy Hour is one of those episodes which ends on a really sombre & downbeat note , if anyone tells you that there is always a happy ending to Quincy then show them this one . Unhappy Hour started off quite promisingly with a decent car crash & a potentially funny subplot as Asten & Quincy exchange jobs for a few days as Asten wants Quincy to know how hard his job actually is but this is quickly dumped & Quincy takes a back seat as Asten is the main focus of the episode . Unfortunately Asten just isn't Quincy & his speech at the end proves that , in fact Quincy is barely in this episode . There's also a bit of a production goof here , when Asten visits his niece Melody in hospital he refers to the accident as being ' last night ' yet at the start of the programme the crash clearly takes place during the day . I would suspect both scenes were filmed well out of sequence which might explain it . The acting is alright but Klugman hardly features in this one & everyone just comes across as , well not as good frankly . Unhappy Hour is far from my favourite Quincy , it's boring , dull & has several plot holes . There are much , much better Quincy episodes out there that you could be watching instead .
498392	1355507	338095	4.0	Starts good , ends crap . . .	Haute Tension , or either High Tension or Switchblade Romance as it's know to English speaking audiences , starts as two college friends Marie ( Cecile De France ) & Alexia ( Maiwenn Le Besco ) head to Alexia's parents house for the weekend . Marie is given the uppermost room in the large house & that night sees an old rusty van pull up outside & the guy inside gets out & rings the doorbell , Alexia's Father Daniel ( Andrei Finti ) answers the door & is brutally murdered . The killer then systematically slaughter's everyone else in the house except Marie who manages to hide & Alexia who the killer ties up & locks in the back of his van , however before he can drive off Marie sneaks into the van with the intention of saving Alexia before she becomes his next victim . . . This French production was co-written & directed by Alexandre Aja & for the first 70 odd minutes Haute Tension is a top horror film but then Aja & co-writer Gregory Levasseur decide to ruin it by throwing in what must be the second worst twist ending I've ever seen , I mean what on Earth were they thinking ? For those interested Breaking Dawn ( 2004 ) still has the worst twist I've seen though . The film starts out very promising with a scene of someone using a decapitated head to sexually please themselves & the wonderfully staged massacre of Alexia's family along with the ensuing cat & mouse game between Marie & the killer as in a way the tradition slasher film roles are reversed as Marie has to stalk him to an extent in an attempt to save her friend . I was really enjoying Haute Tension & thought it was quite fresh & very effective , at this point the film was on for an from me but then that ending spoiled it big time & frankly I think I'm being generous by still giving it a 4 . Basically the truly awful twist killed the entire film for me , I thought it ruined everything that had gone before & turned what was up to that point a nice exercise in savage cinema into a complete mess . Haute Tension uses the same split personality twist used so effectively in the brilliant Fight Club ( 1999 ) although here it feels like an afterthought & makes absolutely no sense within the context of the rest of the film , how can someone have a fight with themselves ? Where did the old van come from when Marie & Alexia clearly drive together in a Citreon ? Why kill the gas station attendant ? In fact almost everything that has gone before in Haute Tension seems like a contradiction , the scene at the start with the killer & decapitated head now is totally meaningless & the filmmakers just don't get the whole point-of-view thing & it just doesn't work with the rest of the film . Neither was I convinced by the killers motives , oh that's right they aren't really given any so that's probably why . . . Director Aja does a great job with the violence , the tension , atmosphere & it's a pretty stylish film all round . It's a very tense film with some great sequences but what's the point with that ending where everything good the film had managed to build up is lost , honestly . Like a lot of these muddled ' cult ' type films there are plenty of internet message board activity about the ending with lots of people trying to explain in minute detail everything , personally I think life is too short to worry about a stupid nonsensical film such as Haute Tension , there are better things to do . To it's credit there's some top gore here , there's one of the best slit throats your likely to see , there's a decapitation , a severed hand , someone is sliced up with a cement saw , someone is axed to death & there are large helpings of blood splattered all over the shop . With a supposed budget of about $430 , 000 the makers of Haute Tension didn't have much to work with & they do wonders , to it's credit it's very well made with a definite slickness , it's just a shame about the end . Shot in French it's hard to know how everyone acts but they all seem to scream & cry in the right places so I'll assume it's decent . Haute Tension is top-notch for 70 odd minutes & complete total & utter crap for the remaining 20 odd that ruins everything that has gone before , a real disappointment considering how well it had started . It's a difficult one to call as I'm sure there are people out there who will love it but overall it's not a film I look back on with any fondness apart from one of the coolest slit throats in cinematic history , the choice is yours .
498042	1355507	83624	4.0	OK ultra low budget horror film , but not as good as some make out .	Dr . Julius Lifflander ( Bill Freeman ) has just left his house and is walking down his garden path when he hears noises coming from some nearby bushes . He returns to his house and locks himself in . The phone lines are cut . He is then killed by someone or something with a grotesquely disfigured hand . Duane Bradley ( Kevin Van Hentenryck ) walks through the streets of New York City holding tightly on to a wicker basket past drug dealers and porno cinemas ( is this what Times Square really used to be like ? ) , he comes across and decides to stay at a cheap ' n ' nasty , low rent , flea pit of a hotel in Times Square called the Broslin . He tells the Broslin's manager ( Robert Vogel ) that he wants to rent a room for an indefinite period of time , he is given room No . 7 . The next day Duane visits a seedy and inept doctor named Harold Needleman ( Lloyd Pace ) , while there Duane and Dr . Needleman's receptionist , Sharon ( Terri Susan Smith ) arrange to meet up and for her to show him some of New Yorks sights . That night Needleman is killed by Belial , Duanes deformed freakish Siamese twin who Duane carries around in his wicker basket and has a psychic link with . It seems that Duane and Belial were born joined together at Duanes waist , in upstate New York Glens falls . Their mother died giving birth , which left their father ( Richard Pierce ) a little bitter and resentful towards Belial . On Duane's and Belial's twelfth birthday their father hires three unscrupulous doctors , Lifflander , Needleman and a female doctor named Judith Kutter ( Diana Browne ) who perform the surgery to separate the twins . Belial takes revenge on his father by cutting him in half with a buzz saw . Their loving aunt ( Ruth Neuman ) looks after them both from this point onwards , but after she dies Belial convinces Duane to travel to Manhattan and gain revenge on the doctors that separated them . Thing get even more complicated when Duane falls in love with Sharon , a situation Belial is far from happy about . Belial is one mad twisted freak who wants revenge at any cost ! Edited , written and directed by Frank Henenlotter I thought this was average at best . The low budget really hinders it , everything just looks so cheap . To Henenlotter's credit though he seems to have had lots of enthusiasm for the film and makes the most out of what he had , which probably equalled more or less nothing . The acting is atrocious , the romantic scenes between Van Hentenryck and Susan Smith are embarrassingly badly written and performed especially the one set in front of the Statue of Liberty . The only cast member who comes away with any credit is Vogel as the sleazy Broslin's overworked and underpaid manager , he's really funny and steals every scene he's in . The pacing is a little off , as is the dialogue sometimes which doesn't do the film any favours . And what's with Belial's glowing red eyes at the end ? The gore is OK , mostly just splashes of blood but the sequence where Belial and Duane are separated is quite explicit and there is a fun scene as someone gets a face full of scalpels . There is some stop motion animation for Belial that looks absolutely terrible , some of the worse I've ever seen ! The sleazy 80's New York setting is a little underused in my opinion , apart from the opening when Duane walks through Times Square at night , the Statue of Liberty scene and one or two other little shots here and there you wouldn't really be able to tell where this was set . Worth a watch for horror fans to be sure , but just don't go in expecting the classic many seem to make out .
498038	1355507	91343	4.0	John's got a half brother . Half brother , half something else . Below average late 80's ' mad scientist ' horror film , pretty bad actually .	The Kindred opens to shots of a Porsche racing along a highway , it catches up with an old pick-up truck and gets held up . As it speeds past the pick-up the driver ( Benjamin J . Perry as Ben Perry ) shouts obscenities and honks his horn . Distracted he doesn't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his Porsche . He is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital . On the way the Paramedic ( Randy Harrington ) trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it . Then the Ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van . The driver of the van , Jackson ( Jim Boeke as James F . Boeke ) beats the Paramedic up and steals the patient . The Ambulance driver , Harry ( Charles Grueber ) makes no attempt to stop him . Once the injured man has been placed into the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry whom seem to know each other . Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw ' last time ' . Jackson punches Harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him . The film then makes it perfectly clear we are in San Fransisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge . Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend Dr . John Hollins ( David Allen Brooks ) to inform him that his Mother , Amanda ( Kim Hunter ) who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness . Hollins works for a company called the ' Geneticell Corporation ' and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her . Once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments , especially the ' Anthony journals ' which Hollins has never heard of , she also claims that he has a brother named Anthony . Back at Geneticell , Hollins talks with a Dr . Phillip Lloyd ( Rod Steiger ) about his Mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other , and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called Anthony . He claims he knows nothing . When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr . Lloyd , Hollins decides to carry out his Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is . While paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named Melissa Leftridge ( Amanda Pays ) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big admirer of his Mothers work and research after she helped her . Because Melissa seems to know so much about his Mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has . Hollins , Sharon , Melissa and three lab assistants , Brad Baxter ( Peter Frechette ) , Hart Phillips ( Timothy Gibbs ) and Cindy Russell ( Julia Montgomery ) plus a girl with a watermelon ( ! ) named Nell Valentine ( Bunki Z , great name what were her parents thinking ! ? ) . They get down to business straight away but find little of any interest . For some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement , which is just as well as there's something down there , something large , slimy and has lots of tentacles . First it kills Duke , the dog . Then it moves on to larger prey . When Hart is attacked by something in a barn Hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his Mothers work and whatever Anthony is . Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow , Carpenter also acted as cinematographer and Obrow as producer . This is a pretty poor film in my opinion . The script is credited to five ( ! ) writers , Carpenter , Obrow , Earl Ghaffari , John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this . Nothing is explained that well , why did Amanda create these monstrous sea creature / human hybrids ? What is Dr . Lloyd's interest and his motives ? Why does he steal bodies from the back of Ambulance's ? Why does he have a basement full of mutants ? Why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think to check the basement out ? Could Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried ? Why are none of the characters given any background ? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99 . 9 % of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about ? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore , only one person dies on screen , just one ! And all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy ' happy ending ' . This is a horror film guys , all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways . The one on screen death is actually quite cool , someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin , in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence . To try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where Dr . Lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds , and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing . Melissa also turns into a fish , don't ask . There's no nudity either , which isn't a surprise . The film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace , we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late , when it does make an appearance the effects are OK and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more . Overall I was very disappointed and I was expecting a lot better . A horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total , what's the world coming too ?
499341	1355507	290334	4.0	Didn't do much for me at all .	X2 starts as an attempt is made on the US President's ( Cotter Smith ) life in the Oval office by a teleporting mutant called Nightcrawler ( Alan Cumming ) , the President sees this as an act of aggression on the part of all mutants & orders Willaim Stryker ( Bran Cox ) a military General to tighten up on mutant security . However it is in fact Stryker who was responsible for the attack & with the President's authority as well as some forged documents he sets out on his own personal crusade to rid the entire world of mutants , Stryker learns from Magneto ( Ian McKellen ) that Charles Xavier ( Patrick Stewart ) runs a school for mutants & the existence of the Cerebro machine in which Xavier can telepathically communicate with any living creature on the planet . Stryker intends to force Xavier to make contact with every mutant on Earth & telepathically kill them all . . . Directed by Bryan Singer who also has a small cameo in the film as one of the security men in Magneto's plastic prison this was the sequel to the original X-Men ( 2000 ) film the huge financial success of which pretty much got the whole Marvel superhero comic book adaptation thing going with such large box-office returns , the likes of Spider-Man ( 2002 ) , Daredevil ( 2003 ) , Hulk ( 2003 ) , Elektra ( 2005 ) , Fantastic Four ( 2005 ) , Ghosr Rider ( 2007 ) , the Blade trilogy & Iron Man ( 2008 ) duly followed to cash in on the cinema going publics craze for these superhero flicks . To be brutally honest I've never really been that impressed with the genre with the notable exceptions being the excellent Blade films & the fun Spider-Man flicks & the silly titled X2 ( why not X-Men 2 ? ) does nothing to change my overall opinion . I think one factor is these larger than life superhero character's with all manner of odd abilities were designed for a 2-D comic book rather than a 3-D film & with a few expectations they look better as a comic strip than a live action character , the basic mechanics & demands of a full length feature film are just very different than a simple comic strip . The script by Michael Dougherty , Dan Harris & David Hayter is really weak , the character's are poor & lets not forget that not everyone will have read the comics or seen the original film , the story is also very poor . It feels very slow & pedestrian , most of it takes place between mutants in imaginary settings & therefore I found it very hard to think of the film taking place in reality . I know it's pure sci-fi but for it to work it needs to be grounded in some sort of recognisable reality otherwise where's the threat coming from ? Also the X-Men themselves are too powerful , between them they can do just about anything including Wolverine who can get shot on the head yet heal himself . You just always felt they would be able to overcome any situation they find themselves in & it just kills any excitement or tension . At well over two hours X2 feels like it goes on forever , there aren't that many memorable set-pieces & as a whole I think X2 is one of the poorer Marvel superhero comic book films . Director Singer does alright but there's not much here that really stands out , there are a few forgettable fights , some exploding cop cars , a bust dam spewing water & a few flashy CGI computer effects . In fact I was quite surprised at how bland & routine feeling the action scenes were considering the budget . I also didn't like the way this was filmed , the scene at the end when Xavier & the rest of the X-Men turn up in the President's office with lightening flashing outside is truly embarrassing . I suspect that it was meant to be sinister & atmospheric but I just thought it looked awful & over dramatic . The special effects are generally very good but like most CGI computer effects you just ' know ' what your watching is an effect . With a supposed budget of about $110 , 000 , 000 one has to say X2 is well made with high production values & that big budget Hollywood look & feel to it . I personally thought the acting was awful , the scenes at the end as they mourn Jean Grey are embarrassing , the shots around the camp fire as Magneto fills the rest of the X-Men in on Stryker's plans & they all try to look worried & concerned is another cringe worthy moment as is Rouge's ' scared ' reaction when she lands the jet plane at the end . Hugh Jackman can't act , Halle Berry can't act ( how did she ever win an Oscar ? ) although she does look good in tight leather & even great actors like Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart seem off colour . X2 was a big disappointment to me , I was expecting lots of action & great effects but what I ended up with was a passable superhero comic book adaptation & nothing more . The story is very weak , the character's are weak & the action is forgettable . Followed by X-Men : The Last Stand ( 2006 ) .
499088	1355507	87985	4.0	Not that good .	Red Dawn starts like any other day in a small Colorado town , however the normal tranquillity is soon shattered when Russian soldiers parachute out of the sky & start killing everyone . In a systematic coordinated attack right across America starting in Mexico allied Soviet & Cuban forces have invaded the US & World War III has begun . Brother's Jed ( Patrick Swayze ) & Matt Eckert ( Charlie Sheen ) along with several of their high school buddies manage to escape the initial invasion & make it to the relative safety of the Colorado mountains . With no option but to fight the teenagers take arms & wage their own personal war against the Soviet Cuban scum who have invaded their homeland & killed innocent Americans . . . Co-written & directed by avid gun collector & pro-gun activist John Milius one has to say that I really didn't think too much of this overly sentimental teenage action film . The script by Milius & Kevin Reynolds takes itself deadly seriously & is very pro the right to bear arms all the way , it says that the right of each American to own a gun is good because America is the land of the free & in the event of an attack by the Russians or any other evil superpower individual Americans will be able to defend themselves . I suppose Red Dawn tries to tap into the fears people had at the time , fears about Cummunism , about Russia , about World War III , about nuclear warfare , about increasing legislation in owning a gun which Red Dawn repeatedly says owning a gun is every American's God given right & the whole survivalist movement . The character's aren't great , there's the clichéd action film theme of ordinary people being thrust into an extraordinary situation & having to toughen-up & overcome the odds , you know the sort of thing I mean . Nothing really works that well , while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's , in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart . The film never leaves the confines of the Colorado town either & I for one never really felt like the whole of the US was at war . At almost two hours it felt like it went on forever , the action isn't anything special & it's hard to believe a group of teenagers could take on & defeat a heavily armed platoon of highly trained soldiers . I read somewhere once that someone thought Red Dawn resembled The Goonies ( 1985 ) but with guns & rocket launchers which I think is actually quite an apt description . Director Milius nails his allegiances down here , there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which I found rather laughable . The scene of the teenagers listening to the radio & the American national anthem comes on to keep the nations spirits up is just so forced & cheap it's untrue . Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states , The Flamingo Kid ( 1984 ) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it . There is a fairly high body count & a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent & whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable . Amazingly the term ' Red Dawn ' was the given code name for the military operation in Iraq that captured Saddam Hussein back in 2003 ! The film is well made with decent production values , the military vehicles & the like look very authentic I suppose & the New Mexico location shooting has some nice scenery . There are several sizable parts of the film which are subtitled . The acting is in my opinion very poor , the likes of Patrick Swayze , Charlie Sheen in his film debut , C . Thomas Howell , Lea Thompson , Harry Dean Stanton & Powers Boothe are capable of much better than this & some of the performances are truly dire . Red Dawn is not a film that I can say I liked , it's pro-war pro-gun patriotic nonsense that has dated very badly & is a bit of a chore to sit through in one sitting . Apparently set to be remade as Red Dawn ( 2010 ) .
497126	1355507	431418	4.0	" It's like someone came in here & tore through these guys like tissue paper . " Below average creature feature .	Stinger starts ' 3 Months Ago ' on the submarine the SS Newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions . . . Jump to ' Camp Pendleton ' a couple of months later where General Ashford ( James Cagnard ) brief's Lieutenant Williams ( John Miranda ) on his mission to board the Newark & assist genetic scientist Dr . Carly Ryan ( Michelle Meadows ) , before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the Newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from Dr . Mike Thompson ( Casey Clark ) who doesn't make much sense . It's not long before the scorpions attack , first to fall is Lt . Williams so Sergeant Sam Harmon ( Christopher Persson ) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever . . . This Sweedish America co-production was directed by Martin Munthe & he also handled the cinematography & I thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature . It's early into the new year & Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster / creature / insect type film I've seen in 2007 , hopefully things can only get better . . . The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clichéd & gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably Aliens ( 1986 ) , lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine , there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film , there's the scientists including a blonde Sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster / alien / insect or whatever , in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers . Yeah , it's all here , unfortunately Stinger isn't an Aliens if you get what I mean . It's a touch long at over 100 minutes & it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the IMDb . . . Director Munthe doesn't distinguish himself , it's not scary , there's a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting . There's not many scorpion attacks & it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs , the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but I have seen worse that's for sure . I mean that's not to say the effects in Stinger are good but I've seen worse . There isn't much blood or gore , there's some mutilated bodies , some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half . The only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked Sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions . . . However there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply / computer boards with a hammer & it works as well . . . Technically Stinger is average at best & there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous . Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if your interested . The acting was poor & there's nothing else to say . Stinger isn't a great film & it isn't a great horror film either , I can't recommend it at all but I've seen worse . If you liked Stinger ( unlikely ) you might like the similarly themed ' giant scorpions on the loose ' films Tail Sting ( 2001 ) or Scorpius Gigantus ( 2006 ) ( just as unlikely ) .
497614	1355507	83722	4.0	A nation of animal lovers ? Yeah , but this is quite literally going too far .	Irena Gallier ( Nastassja Kinski ) arrives in New Orleans for the first time . Irena is greeted at the airport by her brother Paul ( Malcolm McDowell ) who she has never met . Paul takes Irena back to his house but soon disappears . A prostitute named Ruthie ( Lynn Lowry ) is late for a client . She enters the seedy room and finds a strange slimy substance on the bed . She also notices a black fury thing sticking out from under the bed , she kicks it with her high heeled shoes and it turns out to be the tail belonging to a huge black Leopard which mauls her ankle but she manages to escape . Oh , and her bra ' rips ' in the middle exposing her breasts . The massage parlour's manager ( John H . Fields ) traps the Leopard in the room and calls the authorities . The city zoo's curator Dr . Oliver Yates ( John Heard ) and his team , Alice Perrin ( Annette O'Toole ) and Joe Creigh ( Ed Begley Jr . ) are called in to capture the Leopard . Irena decides to see the sights that New Orleans has to offer . Irena eventually ends up at the zoo where she sees the Leopard , now safely behind the bars of a cage . Irena stays behind after the zoo closes and is found by Oliver . They strike up a friendship and within a few hours Oliver has given Irena a job in the zoo's gift shop . One day while Joe tries to feed the Leopard it rips his arm off and Joe dies , Oliver decides to shoot the Leopard but when he returns with a gun he finds the Leopard gone and a strange slimy substance on the floor . That night Paul returns home and confronts Irena , making sexual advances towards her . Irena runs from Paul and stops a police car . Back at Paul's house they make a grisly discovery in the basement . Paul needs Irena and will do whatever it takes to convince her she needs him too . Things become even more complicated when Irena and Oliver fall in love but Irena refuses to have sex with him , as events unfold it becomes clear that Irena and Paul both harbour a dark secret . Extensively re-written and directed by Paul Schrader I thought this was one of the dullest and most boring nothing horror films that I have seen in some time . The script that was originally written by Alan Ormsby before the re-write by Schrader is so slow it's frightening , and at almost two hours long the Cat People outstays it's welcome well before the end credits roll . For most of the first hour , maybe a little more , it's no more than a drama as the film focuses on Oliver's and Irena's relationship and not much else . The film also has many unnecessary sequences and drags , badly . Another small problem is that the film tries to present it's story as some kind of mystery , well I don't want to seem fussy but the films title is ' Cat People ' and that sort of gives it away and it doesn't come as a surprise that people turn into Leopards if you know what I mean . One more thing I don't understand , if these cat people turn into Leopards during or after sexual contact why has Paul already turned into one before the prostitute even enters the room ? Most of the characters are a little on the bitty side and somewhat underdeveloped . I also think it was a mistake to cast Kinski who can't act and on occasion looks like a man with her short hair ( hey , it's true ) and McDowell seems uninterested and unsuited to the role of the bad guy . I have to say that I didn't care about any of the characters involved which is never a good thing in a film . The film has lots of nudity with Kinski the main culprit as she exposes her breasts and body numerous times during the last 30 or so minutes , having said that though most of the female cast take their tops off at some point . There are some strong sex scenes too , especially at the end when Oliver ties a naked Kinski to the bed by her wrists and ankles and then has fairly explicit sex with her . Unfortunately the horror element of the story is severely lacking , in fact there is very little horror in it . There is very little gore either , an autopsy on a Leopard , a bitten off arm and a mangled dead body is about it . The transformation sequence is so short as to be almost inconsequential , although the meagre screen time it does get the transformation looks quite cool . However I will admit that the film has a really nice look throughout and great cinematography by John Bailey which captures the New Orleans locations extremely well . Personally I really didn't find much in this film to like , I will admit that it's well made and tells a story competently enough but I just found the whole thing so dull and uneventful . This is not a film that I can recommend , there are much better horror films out there .
497219	1355507	96109	4.0	" Alright fellows , it's kick-off time . " Bad 80's action that has a certain entertainment value .	Silent Assassins must be seen to be believed . Here's a quick run down of the clichés , erm sorry I mean plot . Wise cracking cop Sam Kettle ( Sam J . Jones ) & his partner Danny ( Dan Beder ) are on a bust to capture big time ex-CIA part criminal all psychopath & all round evil bloke Kendrick ( Gustav Vintas ) but unfortunately Danny gets himself killed . Cliché # 1 , unorthodox cop now has a personal vendetta against a major criminal who killed his partner . Cliché # 2 , said cop has to track said criminal down . Cliché # 3 , even if it costs him his marriage to Sara ( Linda Blair ) which is a breaking point as it is . Kendrick , his sexy side kick Miss Amy ( Rebecca Ferratti ) kidnap Government biological scientist Terrence London ( Bill Erwin ) & an innocent little girl named Joanna ( Joanna Chong ) . Cliché # 4 , cop becomes saddled with innocent parties uncle , Jun Kim ( Jun Chong ) who is instantly transformed into the obligatory fish-out-of-water character who through spending time together befriends cop whose partner was killed & now works alone . Cliché # 5 , despite an entire police force on the case super cop & an ordinary member of the public manage to track evil bad guys down . Cliché # 6 , bad guys try to kill cop & new partner but fail miserably . Cliché # 7 , cop & new found best friend kill all the bad guys with guns that never run out of ammo & don't even get scratched . I could go on & on forever but hopefully you get the idea . . . Directed by Doo-yong Lee & Scott Thomas I actually didn't mind Silent Assassins too much . The script by Will Gates ( I hope that's not some sort of joke ) & Lin Ada isn't going to win any prizes for originality or dramatic content but to it's credit it moves along like a rocket & is quite funny if approached in the right manner & frame of mind . Silent Assassins obviously had zero budget & the fights look a little cheap but they are violent & contain scenes of people having their hands chopped off , being disembowelled , someone is blown up & a brief decapitation with a Samurai sword , while none of this looks particularly impressive it's quite bloody . There is also a torture scene where Dr . London has spikes inserted under his finger nails , ouch ! Forget about Linda Blair getting in on the action despite the artwork on the box where she is shown in black holding a large gun , she is purely to add dramatic impact ( yeah right ! ) & some personal angst between the fights . The fights are OK at best , their reasonably choreographed & to their credit they use lots of weaponry like swords , Freddy Krueger type gloves , knives , guns , rocket launchers ( that you don't have to reload ) & various axes . The filmmakers managed to chuck in a couple of cheap explosions as well . There is a funny bit where Sam glues a mans mouth shut because he was following him & another one when Sam is interviewing a top Government scientist & on his office door it say ' Private No Admittance ' written in blue ink on a piece of paper sellotaped to the door ! Hardly a top scientist's office ! On a technical level the film is rough , it looks like it was shot wherever they could get permission , the music is terrible & sounds as if it was recorded in a tin shed . The cinematography is static & dull as is the whole film generally speaking . Acting wise Jones is OK & makes for a likable enough hero , Blair is awful as is everyone else . Good for a few laughs but not much else especially as it can get a bit nasty at times , having said that it provided a certain charm & had some basic entertainment value . Still , probably best give this one a miss if you can .
497315	1355507	95904	4.0	Almost story free ghost flick .	Prison is set in Wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re-open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years , Warden Eaton Sharpe ( Lane Smith ) is put in charge . 200 odd prisoners are shipped in & they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including Burke ( Viggo Mortensen ) who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber , he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out & all the electrics , gas & fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes . Burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing & no-one is safe . . . Directed by Renny Harlin I thought Prison was a poor late 80's horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story . The script was by Empire Pictures regular C . Courtney Joyner who was responsible for writing such ' classics ' as Class of 1999 ( 1990 ) , Puppet Master III : Toulon's Revenge ( 1991 ) & Puppet Master vs . Demonic Toys ( 2004 ) amongst other low budget horror crap that even I haven't heard of & seems to take itself very seriously . The biggest problems I have with Prison are that it's far too slow , it's over 30 minutes into the film before the ' evil force ' is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as I was concerned , then there's the fact there's no discernible storyline here at all . For a start it never tries to explain why there's an ' evil force ' bricked up in the old execution chamber , it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it's supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn't kill Warden Sharpe straight away , no explanation is given to where Burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted & has come back , there's no real explanation as to how the Warden is connected to everything that's going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it's never revealed what it is or why . To be honest I couldn't really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn't have a rigid story which it follows all the way through . The character's are dull & forgettable , the murders are few & far between , the pacing is way off , the whole film is a mess & even ghosts can't shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero . A less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes , there really are better things you could be doing . Director Harlin's full American flick debut he does a good job & there's a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab , dull , dark prison cells & corridors I started to get bored . I just think the look of the film is far too repetitive , bland & frankly lifeless . I didn't think it was scary & the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body & face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open . Other than that there's a burnt corpse & a mangled body which falls from the ceiling & very little else . There is a scene when the Warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them & then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard , I was watching this scene & thought that you'd never get away with doing something like that . Over here prisoners have rights & if the Warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians & every prisoner would sue the Warden , the prison service & the Government for everything they had & they'd win ! With a supposed budget of about $4 , 000 , 000 Prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn't really look like it on screen , sure there's a decent cast & the few special effects that are included are good but overall it's set in the same location with limited ambition . Prison was actually shot in a real Wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business . The acting is alright , Prison proves that sometimes Hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of Mortensen he has two with this & the awful The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1994 ) both of which I'm sure he'd like to forget about . . . Prison is a dull , lifeless , colourless & humourless waste of 100 minutes , despite one good gore scene I didn't like it at all as I actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events & incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense .
499020	1355507	772172	4.0	" Is my fear fuelling my imagination or is my imagination fuelling my fear ? " Average supernatural horror cheapie .	The Chair starts as psychology student Danielle Velayo ( Alanna Chisolm ) moves into 216 Archwood Drive , a large three storey Victorian house . Initially excited at moving in Danielle starts to get second thoughts when strange , ghostly & supernatural occurrences begin to happen . Doing some research on the house Danielle discovers that 100 years ago a mesmerist named Mordachai Zymytryk ( Paul Soren ) hypnotised sadistic child killer Edgar Crowe ( Adam Seybold ) at the point of his death leaving his soul in limbo . However Crowe's soul is back & begins to possess Danielle in order to carry on his murder spree , can Danielle's loving sister Anna ( Lauren Roy ) save her from Crowe's evil soul & influence ? This Canadian production was directed by Brett Sullivan & I am constantly amazed at how much an audiences opinion can differ , I mean I had a quick scan through the other IMDb comments for The Chair & quite frankly I'm wondering if they saw a completely different film than I did ! I'm sorry but I can't see how anyone could use words like ' awesome ' , ' great ' & ' I loved it ' to describe The Chair , I just can't . Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course but even so . Anyway , I personally thought The Chair was a pretty slow going fairly dull supernatural horror flick that I admit passes the time but there's not enough story here to fill a 90 odd minute film , it's pretty repetitive & I will probably have forgotten everything about it by the end of the weekend . There are a couple of plot holes that I found distracting here , for start how was Danielle connected to the house & the plot twist at the end when her tutor turns out to be Mordechai is just daft beyond belief & doesn't make a blind bit of sense . I mean if Mordechai knew that Crowe's evil spirit was still around & he knew how to stop him ( obviously he does since he does at the end ) then why didn't he kill Crowe before ? Why wait until Crowe possessed someone & started to kill innocent people ? Also there is supposedly footage shot by Mordechai back in 1902 when he first hypnotised Crowe & he talks to the camera & explains everything in a quick & easy exposition scene . Right , well that's OK if it wasn't for the fact film cameras couldn't record speech back then in 1902 ! In fact the very first ' talkie ' film was The Jazz Singer & wasn't made until 1927 . I usually don't mind the odd goof in a piece of fiction but this really bugged me & I picked up on it straight away , it irritated me the entire film ! Then there's the question of how an unemployed student could afford to rent & run a huge three storey house on her own , lets keep it real people OK ? Then there are some truly bizarre scenes like a shot of a hand pushing Danielle under water while she takes a bath but the film suddenly cuts & the next time we see Danielle she's alright & the hand is never mentioned or seen again . There's also a strange scene in which Anna comes home & her sister Danielle is hiding from her on the top shelf in the bathroom ! What's wrong with a cupboard or something simple like that ? Then Danielle gets down & walks around the house naked for no apparent reason ! What makes it even stranger is that Danielle isn't even hiding from Anna so why the top shelf ? The first hour or so is pretty slow going , the last thirty odd minutes is better & at times is even quite good but overall The Chair didn't do much me at all & a glaring plot hole or two doesn't help . According to the IMDb this was shot in director Brett Sullivan's own house , I suppose it keeps the budget down . There is very little variety in The Chair & the film takes place almost entirely in this one location which becomes boring . The chair of the title refers to a torture device the killer Crowe made & uses in the films best moments . Gore wise there's very little here , a screwdriver in someone's head & a bit of blood on a cut . Director Sullivan places his camera all over the place , there are extreme close-ups , there are lots of shots from the ceiling looking down presumably to give some impression of space & he thankfully keeps the CGI computer effects down to a minimum . There's nothing that scary here & as a whole you won't be on the edge of your seat ! Shot in Toronto in Canada the film actually looks quite nice , it certainly looks a lot better than a lot of recent low budget horror & the lack of awful CGI really helps too . The acting is average , I thought the leading lady lady Chisholm looked nice but her performance was wooden , there wasn't any difference between her being possessed by Crowe & not being possessed by him . The Chair is a film that is just about watchable but isn't anything great , I think it would have worked much better as a thirty minute Tales from the Crypt style episode with a dark twist ending which the material lends itself to perfectly . Not to be confused with The Chair ( 1989 ) which is another horror film & is about a cursed electric chair in a prison .
497320	1355507	473553	4.0	" What's your dick doing over there Chuck ? " Another poor low budget straight-to-video horror .	The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell ( Lochlyn Munro ) has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn , he is joined by his girlfriend Darcy Wagner ( Chandra West ) & her young 12 year old daughter Pamela ( Nicole Munoz ) who arrive to help for the weekend . While exploring the property Pamela meets another young girl named Emma ( Jianna Ballard ) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home , she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the Tooth Fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them . Pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out , it's not long before the evil ghost of the Tooth Fairy has her eyes on Pamela's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across . . . Directed by Chuck Bowman I thought The Tooth Fairy was just another poor straight-to-video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable TV schedules , basically it's not very good . The script by producer Stephen J . Cannell , Corey Strode & Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snooze-fest for the first 40 odd minutes , nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone . It introduces the character's , sets the Tooth Fairy legend up & that's it . The second half of the film improves slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff , there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable & forgettable stuff . The character's aren't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off , the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Tooth Fairy herself , it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth ? What happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 ? Why has she come back as a ghost ? Despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people , there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment . Director Bowman does OK , it's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about . There's nothing I would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & don't take any notice of the comparisons between this & Darkness Falls ( 2003 ) as besides the teeth thing they're quite different . The gore is OK , someone is shoved into a wood-chipping machine , there's a decapitation , someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 500 , 000 The Tooth Fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here . The acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad & unusually I didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something I suppose . The Tooth Fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight-to-video horror fare that seems everywhere these days , if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor & forgettable stuff .
498498	1355507	785533	4.0	Another disappointing Masters of Horror episode .	Masters of Horror : The Black Cat starts as the broke Edgar Allan Poe ( Jeffrey Combs ) tries to sell some poetry to his publisher George Graham ( no not the Arsenal football club legend ! ) but he thinks Poe should get back to writing what he writes best , fantastical stories of horror . Poe disagrees & continues to squander his money on drink , however his priorities have to chance when his wife Virginia ( Elyse Levesque ) becomes seriously ill & he has to find money for her medicine . As Poe sit down to write the sort of story Graham ( Aron Tager ) wants his wife's black cat Pluto seems to haunting him & driving him mad . . . This Canadian American co-production was episode 11 from season 2 of the hit-and-miss Masters of Horror TV series , the second Masters of Horror story to be directed by Stuart Gordon I was deeply disappointed by The Black Cat . The script by Gordon & Stuart Paoli feels more like an autobiographical character study rather than horror for the first 40 odd minutes before it finally gets going during it's last quarter . As a lover of the horror genre myself I should be fascinated with this episode which bases it's central premise around Edgar Allan Poe who was responsible for the source material & ideas for a lot of genre films but to be honest I couldn't give a toss about him , I haven't got a clue whether this is an accurate representation of him & what he was like & frankly I couldn't care less either way . So straight away I've got a problem with it , then there's the fact that the majority of the time Poe is painted as some drunk , aggressive , rude , lying brute who I really disliked & that made it very difficult for me to care about anything which was going on . Then there's the clichéd lame cop-out ending which destroy just about everything that has gone before although I admit I didn't see it coming mainly because I thought the likes of Gordon was better than it . I was pretty bored during the opening half but at least things pick up towards the end , it's well written enough I suppose & I can see how some might be drawn in & like it but it didn't do much for me . Director Gordon does a fine job , this one looks good with great period sets & detail as it was set in the first half of the 19th Century ( Poe himself lived between 1809 & 1849 ) . Almost all the colour has been removed & this isn't too far away from being black and white apart from the brilliant creative decision to emphasise all the reds , from the bright red wine to the predictable spurts & splatterings of bright red blood , it's a nice touch which works very well & gives The Black Cat a bit of style . There's not much gore here although there is one big special effect when someone gets an axe stuck in their head in a great scene with plenty of blood , a cat has it's eye poked out , someone coughs up loads of blood & animal lovers should beware a few critters bite the dust so bear that in mind . This one lacks any great scares & there are only a couple of horror themed sequences throughout . Technically The Black Cat is excellent with great production values & it's very well made with a convincingly realised & authentic looking period setting . The acting is good although while I've liked Combs in just about everything I've seen in him I thought he was a bit bland & unlikable in this . The Black Cat certainly isn't a Masters of Horror I will look back on with any great fondness , I'm sorry but it's as simple & straight forward as that . Another week , another Masters of Horror episode , another disappointment .
497645	1355507	71233	4.0	Disappointingly dull companion piece for Flesh for Frankenstein .	Count Dracula ( Udo Kier ) is dying . He needs fresh human blood , the blood of a ' pure wirgin ' as Dracula pronounces it . Dracula is to well known in Romania to be able to locate a virgin , so together with his servant Anton ( Arno Juerging ) he sets out to Italy to find one , because of the Italians strict religious upbringing they believe the chances of finding a virgin will be high . Upon arrival they question some locals and learn of a married couple who live nearby , the Marquis ( Vittorio Di Sicca ) and Marquise Di Fiore ( Maxime McKendry ) who have four unmarried daughters , Esmeralda ( Milena Vukotic ) , Saphiria ( Dominique Darel ) , Rubinia ( Stefania Casini ) , and Perla ( Silvia Dionisio ) . The Marquis has gambled the Di Fiore's family money away and by marrying one of their daughters off to a sick looking Dracula they think they will inherit his money when he dies . Dracula and Anton are invited to stay at their large , but run down house . Once there Dracula has the opportunity suck all the blood he needs , but thanks to Mario Balato ( Joe Dallesandro ) the Di Fiore's servant , some of the girls aren't as pure as Dracula needs . Before long Mario becomes suspicious of the Count , but will he find out the truth too late ? Written and directed by Paul Morrissey I was very disappointed by this extremely talky , overlong and rather dull excuse for a horror film . In fact it's more of a historical drama / sex film rather than horror . There's a lot of naked flesh and sex on show , the girls even go topless when gardening . There are only three gore scenes in the whole film , two scenes where Kier violently throws up impure blood and when Dracula is gorily killed at the end with an axe . After the funny black humour and over the top gore of Flesh for Frankenstein , which was made at the same time with some of the same cast and crew , I was expecting more of the same . Unfortunately I didn't get it . The film looks quite nice having being filmed in real historic locations in Europe and Kier is watchable as Count Dracula , as he always is . But the film just takes too long for anything interesting to happen and it becomes very boring to watch . There are very few characters in the film , once Dracula arrives at the Di Fiore's house the Di Fiore's themselves , their daughters , Mario , Dracula and Anton are the only characters seen on screen for the whole of the rest of the film . Apart from some nice scenery there is very little to recommend here for horror fans , disappointing .
499035	1355507	681842	4.0	Slightly below average Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Sweet Land of Liberty starts late one night as LAPD cops Kemper ( Paul Tuerpe ) & DiGregorio ( Bert Santos ) investigate a possible stolen car parked outside a house , they knock on the door of the house & a Japanese woman named Lee ( Nobu McCarthy ) answers . The two cops ask to speak to her husband Steve ( Bill Saito ) who panics & has a violent attack in which he shoots Kemper dead . Kemper ends up on Los Angeles coroner Quincy's ( Jack Klugman ) autopsy table , it seems an open & shut case . But then Sam ( Robert Ito ) notices on the police report who is accused of killing the cop , Steve was like a brother to Sam while he was growing up & Sam refuses to believe that Steve could kill a young cop in cold blood for no reason . Then the next morning & Steve is found hanged in his cell , Sam is determined to clear Steve's name & find out what made him kill a cop & take his own life . . . Episode 6 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Robert Loggia & one has to say that I didn't think that much of it . For a start there's no real mystery element in it at all , there's no murder to solve or killer to find & that hurts the overall interest level . Then there's the fact that Quincy takes a back seat for this episode & it's Sam who orchestrates the moral crusade , in the case of Sweet Land of Liberty against the US Army for giving experimental drugs to interrogation victims . This of course raises the issues surrounding human experimentation , the US Army thinking it can do whatever it wants & the after effect of such treatment on it's soldiers which can last for decades . This isn't anything new though , is it ? I mean we have had all sorts of films & telly programmes in which Vietnam vets go mad , go on killing sprees & / or are unable to readjust to normal civilian society . Despite Sam being a good character he usually plays second fiddle to Quincy which is just the way it should be , I mean this episode proves that beyond any shadow of a doubt . Sam's alright but he ain't no Quincy ! Then again who is ? At fifty minutes it's a little slow at times , the story lacks a hook or any intrigue , the character's are pretty clichéd & it's far too predictable . Does anyone out there not believe Sam & Quincy will not prove Steve innocent ? Also the fact that the young cops death seems secondary to everyone doesn't help matters , it's clear that Steve killed the cop & that's that . I don't care whether he wasn't responsible for his actions he still killed him & yet he is talked about like a hero . Didn't sit too well with me at all , just like the episode in general . The climax of Sweet Land of Liberty sees Quincy & Sam in Washington attend a full military funeral at Arlington , this is probably one of the few times they filmed outside California . Unusually this is a Danny free episode , in fact Danny's bar doesn't even feature either . The acting is alright , Klugman is just brilliant as usual ( his arguing with Jim at the end in particular ) but he doesn't get much to do as this episode is all about Sam & I'm sorry but Ito just isn't a strong enough performer to carry a emotionally loaded episode such as this . Ex professional baseball player Stack Pierce makes the second of his three Quincy guest appearances here . Sweet Land of Liberty isn't classic Quincy , in fact one could rename this episode to Sam L . A . ( Laboratory Asisstant ) ! This one didn't do much for me at all & the cop that Steve killed was too easily forgotten .
497077	1355507	595624	4.0	One of the poorer Hammer House of Horror episodes . . .	Hammer House of Horror : Visitor from the Grave is set in rural England & starts late one night as rich American Penny Van Prutten ( Kathryn Leigh Scott ) is home alone in her isolated cottage in the woods , loud banging on the front door wakes her & a man named Charles Willowbee ( Stanley Lebor ) breaks in . Charles says he wants her boyfriend Harry Wells ( Simon MacCorkindale ) but he isn't there so Charles turns his attention to Penny & tries to rape her but Penny grabs a double barrelled shotgun & shoots him . The next morning & Harry arrives back at the cottage to find blood on the floor , Penny is hysterics & Charles dead body . Harry says he will bury the body & no-one will ever know what happened , unfortunately Penny is haunted by visions of Charles whose ghost seems to want revenge on her . . . Visitor from the Grave was episode 11 from the one & only season of this British horror anthology series of macabre tales produced by Hammer studios for TV , originally airing over here during November 1980 one has to say that Visitor from the Grave is one of the poorer episodes from this generally high quality series . The script was by Anthony Hinds who had written many scripts for Hammer including The Brides of Dracula ( 1960 ) , The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) , The Evil of Frankenstein ( 1964 ) , Dracula : Prince of Darkness ( 1966 ) , Dracula Has Risen from the Grave ( 1968 ) , Taste the Blood of Dracula ( 1970 ) , The Scars of Dracula ( 1970 ) & Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell ( 1974 ) to name but a few & with this sort of pedigree one would have thought Hinds might have been able to come up with something a little better than this contrived , insanely convoluted & downright silly piece of telly . You can see the twist ending coming quite literally a mile off , it's so obvious & predictable it's almost embarrassing when it happens . The whole thing is one big con but there are many flaws in the plan , for a start what if Penny had called the police after shooting Charles ? That would have buggered their plans up wouldn't it ? The whole fifty odd minutes is full of holes , script problems , improbabilities & just poor plotting which makes Visitor from the Grave a less than satisfying way to spend fifty minutes . Director Peter Sasdy does alright but no-ones heart seems to be in it , the opening scenes of Charles breaking into the cottage are quite effective but some of the set-pieces thereafter are hilariously bad including the climatic séance which has to be seen to be believed . It's a wonder any of the actors involved kept a straight face especially the guy in the bad false beard , turban & dark sunglasses . There's no blood or gore in this one , unfortunately . Visitor from the Grave is one of the poorer Hammer House of Horror episodes with a bad script & a bad central premise , I don't know what else to tell you really other than there are better episodes out there to watch instead of this .
497744	1355507	840304	4.0	" We gotta go down there & blow those hairy mother's away . " Better than average Sci-Fi Channel Creature Feature .	Ice Spiders is set in the Lost Mountain skiing resort in Logan County in Utah where hotshot skier Dan ' Dash ' Dashiell ( Patrick Muldoon ) works as a ski instructor , local ranger Rick Dickerson ( K . Danor Gerald ) ask's Dash for help in searching for two missing hunter's on a nearby mountain range which Dash dutifully agrees to . They find one of the hunters dead , horribly mutilated & the other cocooned in what looks like Spider's silk . Then they are attacked a giant genetically created Spider that has escaped from a nearby Government laboratory , with six deadly giant Spider's on the loose in total no-one is safe as it's up to ex-marine & all round hero Dash to go way beyond the call of duty to save the day . . . Directed by Tibor Takács this is yet another ' Creature Feature ' Sci-Fi Channel original that is far from original & is pretty standard stuff from start to finish . The script features everything any seasoned ' Creature Feature ' lover would expect , there's the young teenage cast , the all American hero who has to overcome some sort of fear to save the day , genetically created creatures of some sort developed for military purposes , bad CGI computer effects , an isolated location for the Spider's to attack & the human cast to get stuck in , a corrupt scientist who only cares about the experiment & not human life , a military presence & of course a love interest for the lead hero . It's all here in abundance . Ice Spiders is far from the worst of it's kind that I have seen , it's still not a particularly good film by any stretch of the imagination but I did enjoy it to a certain extent more than I thought I would . The pace is good & from the opening Spider attack scene right through to the end the film never slows down & I can't say I was bored although what I was more than aware that what I was watching was still pretty average stuff . The character's are alright & aren't as annoying as usual , the plot is fairly standard stuff & it's clear not much thought went into other than to hang the basic ' genetically creature giant creature on the loose ' plot around & there's a few amusing scenes here if your in the right mood I suppose . The dialogue is of often unintentionally funny & the film doesn't seem to take itself too seriously & while I would hesitate to describe Ice Spiders as a good film I certainly don't think it's a terrible one either . There is no build up to the revelation of the Spider's in Ice Spiders & one is seen in it's full CGI glory within the first three minutes , the cheap looking CGI computer effects range from the strictly average to the absolutely awful . There's no real build up of tension to any of the attack scenes either so the film lacks any scares or any atmosphere & the entire thing takes place during the day which makes things easy to see but setting a horror film about giant Spider's in broad daylight cuts down the options for suspense sequences & as such the film lacks any . There's some minor gore here , someone is seen ripped in half , there are a few mutilated bodies , some blood splatter & some mutilated animal bodies too . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 the production values are alright , the mountain wilderness scenery is nice enough to look at & poor CGI computer effects apart it's reasonably well made . The acting is mostly poor from people who look like they don't want to be there , Patrick Muldoon in particular looks to be putting zero effort into things . Even though Vanessa Williams was forty three when she shot Ice Spiders she looks about nineteen in it . Ice Spiders is a slightly better than usual Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' although that in itself isn't saying much & is certainly no recommendation . Not bad for it's type but since it's type is usually so awful it's still nothing worth busting a gut to see .
497986	1355507	745532	5.0	Thematically odd moralistic episode .	Werewolf : The Boy Who Cried Werewolf starts as bounty hunter Alamo Joe Rogan ( Lance LeGault ) chases Eric ( John J . York ) the Werewolf through some woods late at night , Rogan manages to shoot & wound the beast . While outside a young monster mad boy named Davey ( Danny Cooksey ) finds the injured Werewolf & takes it to his tree-house . The next morning & the Werewolf has changed back to Eric & Davey agrees to help him as Rogan continues his relentless search . . . Episode three from the first & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during July 1987 , directed by Larry Shaw this is probably the first stand alone episode after the feature length pilot & the second episode Nightwatch which followed directly on from it . Here in The Boy Who Cried Werewolf we see some serious stereotypes , the young boy who is mad about monsters , disbelieving parents & an abusive drunk who is dating his mum who does nothing but shout , drink beer & behave violently towards those who can't stand up for themselves at even the slightest provocation . The writing really isn't that great here & it's a rather predictable episode too with Eric transforming into a Werewolf at the end & dishing out some just desserts to you know who . At only twenty five minutes in length at least it's short but with a rather clichéd & tired moral message & an equally tired & clichéd plot The Boy Who Cried Werewolf isn't the best episode the series has to offer while the whole Eric the Werewolf on the run from Rogan stopping to sort out a bully just seem at odds with each . The production values are strong , the opening sequence set at night in the woods as Rogan chases & shoots the Werewolf look really good with some nice lighting effects . Again like Nightwatch the actual Werewolf transformation is not shown but the when seen the Werewolf looks pretty good although they insist on showing it in slow motion , maybe to hide it's lack of movement ? Not overly violent , there's a fight at the end & someones face is scratched where some blood is seen . Davey's tree-house has a huge poster inside it for the Paul Naschy flick The Werewolf Versus Vampire Women ( 1971 ) better known these days on DVD as Werewolf Shadow which provides a nice little homage . The Boy Who Cried Werewolf is a largely forgettable episode where Eric uses his Werewolf powers to help solve a domestic dispute , it just seems a little tired & inappropriate really .
497585	1355507	745520	5.0	Another average episode .	Werewolf : Big Daddy starts as Eric ( John J . York ) arrives at a small Louisiana town called Lanier Parish where he is arrested by local Sheriff Bobby LeCroy ( Brian Libby ) & taken to the mansion of ex-state Governor Will Fraser ( Howard Duff ) also known as ' Big Daddy ' . Big Daddy tells Eric that he is dying of cancer & needs Eric to pass on his Lycanthropy to him so he can live forever . Eric isn't keen on the idea but Big Daddy has ways of getting what he wants by whatever means necessary . . . Episode nineteen from the one & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during November 1987 , directed by Larry Shaw one has to say that Big Daddy is another pretty average episode just like the previous three or four although it's still watchable & fans of the show should still like it . The show has settled down into a regular pattern with each story revolving around the same sort of plot where Eric drifts into some town or job & meets some people , one usually good & one usually evil & finds himself in some sort of situation which he uses his unique Werewolf changing abilities to solve some problem or other usually in favour of the good character & Big Daddy follows that premise pretty closely with the nasty Big Daddy wanting to prolong his life by becoming a Werewolf & his good natured abused daughter Emily who he treats like dirt & has become his personal slave ( the fact that she is black has shades of racism ) coming out on top . The one aspect of Big Daddy that makes it watchable is the twist ending , while it won't knock your socks off it's suitably unpredictable & a fairly satisfying way to round the episode off . There are a couple of Werewolf scenes in Big Daddy but nothing spectacular , there's no blood or gore worth mentioning either . Neither regular character's Skorzeny or bounty hunter Rogan appear in this episode . The whole episode takes place in a big Louisiana plantation mansion which looks nice enough & the episode is nicely lit as usual but the story really isn't up to much & won't live that long in the memory . Big Daddy is an average Werewolf episode , it follows the same sort of pattern a lot of episode from this series have & there's just not much here to get excited about . One for the fans of the show .
496988	1355507	411868	5.0	" After running you over the least I can do is buy you a cup of coffee . " Good story , poor execution .	She Lives by Night starts with sexy Vampire Angela ( Liliana Cabal ) feeding on an unlucky male victim on the side of a road . Once finished she hitchhikes to try & get a lift back to town but is hit by Roger Spellman ( John Woodhouse ) as she steps into the road . Roger stops & runs to Angela but finds that she is totally unharmed except that she has amnesia & can't remember anything about herself . Feeling responsible Roger offers Angela a place to stay until she can sort herself out but they quickly become romantically involved . As the days pass Roger becomes increasingly concerned about Angela & her behaviour , she hates sunlight , never eats proper food & a dark sinister side begins to emerge that Roger really doesn't like . Roger's best friend Carl ( Pat Collins ) disappears & their friend Helen ( Shauna Scott ) suspects Angela & eventually discovers the truth , but will anyone believe her . . . Co-produced & directed by Brett Hull I liked the storyline in She Lives by Night but the final delivery leaves a lot to be desired . The script by co-producer James Stewart has a neat premise & I found the first half of the film a good watch as Angela slowly realises that she is a Vampire & the affect that has on her & Roger , however the second half of the film degenerates into a low-budget boring standard Vampire tale as Angela kills a few people while trying to keep Roger happy . There are only four people in the entire film & they're quite well fleshed out & I thought the dialogue was also pretty good & seemed relaxed & natural . The film is surprisingly long at almost one hour & fifty minutes & I think it would have played a lot better if it had been shortened by ten minutes or so . There is a distinct lack of exploitation elements too & was extremely tame . Director Hull does an OK job , it won't win any awards but it looks alright . There isn't much atmosphere , there aren't really any scares & forget about any sort of blood or gore because there isn't any . She Lives by Night was more of a story driven film which was fine during the first half when it was mildly interesting but towards the end it became rather dull . Technically the film is alright , it's competent throughout at least & considering that it went straight-to-video I couldn't really complain . The acting was pretty decent & Cabal makes for a quite hot looking Vampire . She Lives by Night had a certain potential which it never really fulfilled , I thought it was something a little different to start with but it soon descended into clichéd horror fare that became a chore to sit through . Just about worth a watch if your a fan of the genre but anyone else should probably give it a wide berth .
498730	1355507	52611	5.0	" Extra ! Extra ! Monster attacks London ! " Pretty good by 50's monster film standards .	Behemoth , the Sea Monster begins as American scientist Steve Karnes ( Gene Evans ) lectures his British counterparts in London about the threat of Nuclear testing & the resultant radioactive materials released into the atmosphere , the British upper-class idiots scoff at his theories . Meanwhile in Cornwall a Fisherman named Tom Trevethan ( Henri Vidon ) has a close encounter with a giant radioactive sea monster & ends up dead , shortly after lots of dead fish wash up onto a beach . Back in London Steve hears the news on the TV & thinks that atomic radiation may be responsible so he heads over to his mate & Government minister Professor James Bickford ( Andre Morell ) who heads the Atomic Energy Commission , together they decide to check the situation in Cornwall out & upon examination of the dead fish their worst fears are realised when it is confirmed that they are radioactive . Karnes eventually discovers that a 70 foot tall , 200 foot long prehistoric Dinosaur has been revived by radiation & is heading towards London destroying all in it's path , it's up to Karnes & Bickford to find a way to destroy it . . . This English American co-production was directed by Eugene Lourie who also co-wrote & gets a production design credit as well together with Douglas Hickox who according to the IMDb was uncredited , well not that it matters but I promise you now the version I saw yesterday definitely credited both directors . The script by Lourie & Daniel James is your standard 50's giant monster / Dinosaur created by radiation on the loose causing huge amounts of property damage type film , Behemoth , the Sea Monster isn't the best example in the genre but it's far from the worst & it's watchable if nothing else . The first half is pretty slow going with lots of people trying to act very seriously & warn all of us about the dangers of radiation ( you see even horror films have messages ! ) but it just about held my attention before the behemoth himself rises from the Thames & attacks a ferry & eventually London itself . This part of the film is pretty fun as we get to see a giant Dinosaur walk through the streets of London , it doesn't do much other than walk around a bit but it's still cool to watch although I'm not sure about this radiation nonsense . I mean every so often the monster emits loads of radiation along with an annoying computer beeping sound when it does ! Films have come a long way since Behemoth , the Sea Monster & anyone who has seen any monster film post Jurassic Park ( 1993 ) will be disappointed , extremely unimpressed with the somewhat stiff looking stop-motion special effects & probably bored but I thought the monster & the film as a whole had a certain likability & innocent charm about them plus it runs for less than 80 minutes so that means it won't take too much of your life up . Directors Lourie & Hickox do alright , most of the film isn't anything special & their overall ambitions were probably fairly low in a ' lets make a monster film where a Dinosaur tramples it's way through London ' sort of way . The monster itself looks OK , it's a bit rubbery & looks a bit too much like a model at times but for the majority of the time it's on screen it's a reasonably decent looking thing animated by Willis H . O'Brien & his team . I particularly liked the shot at night when the monster walks in front of a silhouetted Houses of Parliment & Big Ben , it's actually quite a cool looking scene . The shots of it rising up from the water were achieved using a glove puppet which was so cheap the jaw doesn't even move . Just in case your wondering the monster doesn't get to eat anyone which definitely loses it a star . Technically Behemoth , the Sea Monster is OK , the special effects are alright & it's competently made if nothing else . The acting was OK & everyone did their best . Behemoth , the Sea Monster won't go down as a classic in the genre of giant radiation mutated monsters & Dinosaurs on the rampage films but manages to hold it's head above water & is a decent , fun & entertaining little monster film in it's own right . Don't expect the Earth , don't spend too much money on it & you may just enjoy it .
498005	1355507	485774	5.0	" He killed , like , a gazillion people . " Straight-to-DVD slasher , average at best .	Heartstopper starts late one stormy night as convicted serial killer Jonathan Chambers ( James Binkley ) is executed in the electric chair , he is pronounced dead & taken to a nearby hospital to undergo an autopsy . However en-route Sheriff Berger ( Robert Englund ) runs into a suicidal teenager named Sara Wexler ( Meredith Henderson ) crouched in the middle of the road , she is put in the ambulance along with Chambers dead body & taken to the hospital . Sara is seen to & Chambers body is taken to be autopsied , however Chambers isn't dead & comes back to life . He needs to change bodies & Sara is it , he stalks the corridors of the hospital looking for her & ripping out the heart of anyone who gets in his way . . . This Canadian production was directed by Bob Keen & one has to say that Heartstopper isn't the most enjoyable was to spend 85 minutes . The script by Vlady Pildysh & Warren P . Sonoda takes itself very seriously & seems to have taken it's inspiration from Wes Craven's Shocker ( 1989 ) & House III : The Horror Show ( 1989 ) with it's evil deranged killer back from the electric chair type plot , in fact when I think about it there hasn't been an evil deranged killer back from the electric chair type horror film for quite a while which is understandable really . Here in Heartstopper no explanation is given as to why or how Jonathan Chambers survived & came back from the dead , none . Sure there's some sort of living tattoo on his arm & he has some sort of magical pendant around his neck but no concrete explanation is given at any point . Once Chambers comes back to life Heartstopper goes into standard clichéd & predictable teen slasher mode as the rest of the film is spent running around the darkest hospital in film history with Sara & some black dude trying to survive , at no point does anyone suggest they should try to phone anyone which is odd . When the lights go out why don't the generators come on ? Why is it so hard to find a way out ? Can't they just open a window & climb out or something ? One character remarks whether it's a hospital or a prison which is a very good point , I can't believe there is not one single exit or window they could have left through . The character's aren't great , the main teenage leads are annoying & Chambers as a villain is awful as he spouts some really bad dialogue which I suspect was meant to be scary & meaningful but ends up sounding terrible , he just has no on screen menace at all . Director Keen started off in the horror film biz as a special effects make-up man working on films such as Krull ( 1983 ) , Lifeforce ( 1985 ) , Highlander ( 1986 ) , Hellraiser ( 1987 ) , Waxwork ( 1988 ) , Candyman ( 1992 ) , Event Horizon ( 1997 ) & Dog Soldiers ( 2002 ) amongst others & has more recently turned his attention to directing . No offence Bob but stick to what your good at & directing isn't one of them . Heartstopper is set in probably the darkest & most underpopulated hospital in history , there's about six doctors & six patients ! There is a fair amount of gore which saves Heartstopper from being a complete dud , there are the expected ripped out hearts , someones stomach & chest are torn open , there's scalpels in eyeballs & slashed throats , there's mutilated bodies & corpses with their faces torn off & there's plenty of blood splatter too . I wouldn't say Heartstopper is scary , in fact because of the distinct lack of lighting it becomes very frustrating to watch . There's an annoying scene near the start where the doctor is about to perform the autopsy on Chambers body & ask's for the lights to be turned out ! I have never performed an autopsy myself but I would imagine being able to see & having the lights on was a basic requirement ! According to the IMDb Heartstopper had a budget of about $3 , 000 , 000 which I must say does sound quite a lot for what actually ended up on screen , there's nothing here which stands out although it is well made with good special effects . Shot in Ontario in Canada . The acting isn't great , it's alright but not great . Mr cameo himself Robert Englund makes yet another smallish appearance in a cheap horror flick , he's made a career out of it hasn't he ? Heartstopper is an OK teen slasher , it only lasts for 80 odd minutes so at least it's short & there's a fair amount of pleasing gore but a silly script that has lots of loose ends & an annoying location means this is average at best . Heartstopper isn't the worst slasher out there but it's far from the best , you can do better if you try .
498400	1355507	95924	5.0	" I didn't tell nobody round here nothing . . . I'll be glad to tell you the same thing . " Average horror / thriller .	Pulse starts in an ordinary L . A . street which is disturbed by the antics of one of it's residents named Hank Jordan who is wrecking his house with a baseball bat , the police are called & break into Hank's house but find him dead . Young David Rockland ( Joseph Lawrence ) is flying into L . A . from Colorado to spend some time with his Father & Stepmother Bill ( Cliff De Young ) & Ellen ( Roxanne Hart ) , things go well at first but one night when David is left home alone the T . V . & other various electrical appliances seem to take a life of their own & after almost being burned alive by a pilot light David is understandably nervous . Then David hears about the stories concerning the Jordan's & what happened , David becomes convinced that there is an evil presence in his Father's house that will try to kill them , at first Bill isn't having any of it but as the mysterious ' accidents ' begin to add up he starts to change his mind . . . Written & directed by Paul Golding I thought Pulse was an average horror / thriller that never even came close to getting my pulse racing . The script doesn't seem to know what it wants to be or who it wants to appeal too & is loose to say the least , nothing is explained in any sort of detail . What the evil electrical force is or where it came from or what it's trying to do , absolutely nothing about it is revealed . I also think that Pulse will disappoint most potential viewers in the sense that as a fan of horror films which Pulse supposedly is I was expecting a widespread outbreak of electrical devices turning against their owners all across America but in actual fact the pulse never leaves the confines of one house even though it could go anywhere & it doesn't kill a single person on screen , that's right not one person is killed in Pulse which just isn't good enough as far as I'm concerned . Instead director Golding thinks his audience would rather sit through chunks of boring dialogue , stupid unexplained narrative & an annoying teenage kid as the lead , well Mr . Golding I can tell you now that most horror fans like films which are scary & contain some semblance of horror . As it is Pulse tells it's story competently enough despite it's lack of any explanations & while there's nothing spectacular about it it's an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes if you don't expect too much . Director Golding films everything without much style or visual flair but there are a few really effective scenes in which his camera goes ' into ' the electrical equipment & there are some nice close-up shots of the circuit boards & wiring as the pulse melts the solder & rearranges it for reasons I'm not sure about , these shots are easily the most memorable thing about Pulse which says it all really . Pulse isn't scary & there's not much of a horror atmosphere to it either . There are some really dumb bits at the end when David a young kid manages to stop his Father falling back by grabbing him even though his Father probably weighs three times that of David , it wouldn't work in reality would it ? Neither can I forget the scene when a circular saw manages to fire a screw at Bill & hit him in the forehead ! Forget about any proper gore , someone's hand gets cut , someone is burnt & a screw hits someone's forehead is all we get . Technically Pulse is alright , there's nothing really wrong with it . The acting is OK but again nothing special , Lawrence as the young kid gets very irritating . Pulse is an OK film , I'm sure there are people out there who will like it but for me it was too dull , it never explained itself & the decision not to kill anyone during the entire duration of the film was a bad one , a very bad one . There are better films out there .
499361	1355507	175253	5.0	OK tale from the crypt .	Tales from the Crypt : The Trap starts as Lou Paloma ( Bruce McGill ) loses yet another job , his worried wife Irene ( Teri Garr ) reminds him of how much debt they are in & that they have big money problems . Lou becomes desperate & comes up with a plan to defraud his insurance company & cash in on his life policy , blackmailing his mortician brother Billy ( Bruno Kirby ) into helping him they come up with a story that a burglar killed Lou , local mortician Billy would step in & officially pronounce him dead , Irene would receive the insurance money & they would fly off to Rio & live a life of luxury . Could it really be that simple ? This Tales from the Crypt story was episode 1 from season 3 , directed by Michael J . Fox who also has a small role in The Trap I thought this was a disappointing opener to season 3 . The script by Scott Alexander was based on a story from the ' Shock SuspenStories ' comic book & is more of a crime thriller than horror which isn't the type story I want to see while watching Tale from the Crypt , generally speaking The Trap is a pretty straight forward crime thriller with the usual Tales from the Crypt twist at the end which really isn't that surprising & if you think about it has plenty of plot holes & just doesn't work . Directed by Michael J . Fox himself I'm sure he didn't appreciate the story he was given as there's no horror , no suspense or gore in this episode , I mean what the hell was the point ? The acting is OK & there's a few decent over-the-top performances here especially McGill . The Trap is average Tales from the Crypt & one for the fans only really as there are far better stories out there , hopefully this isn't representative of the rest of season 3 .

Episode twelve from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during January 1989 , the one & only directorial effort from special make-up effects man Greg Cannom ( whose higher profile make-up effects credits include the likes of Titanic ( 19970 ) , Blade ( 1998 ) , Hannibal ( 2001 ) , The Passion of the Christ ( 2004 ) , Van Helsing ( 2004 ) , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( 2008 ) & Watchmen ( 2009 ) as well as a whole slew of low budget horror ) & isn't a bad installment but isn't amongst the show's best . The one surprise is that the script doesn't go down the moralistic route in the sense I thought the character's involved would either die or be killed because of their own stupidity or greed trying to steal the gold & I actually think Fools ' Gold would have been much more satisfying if that's the way the script had gone . The fact two of the three main character's survive seems a little pointless & to me this episode felt like a missed opportunity . A bit . Still , at only twenty odd minutes in length it moves along at a good pace & at least merits a watch if nothing else . This one has an 80's horror film feel to it with the lighting & the sets being quite atmospheric . The featured monster in Fools ' Gold is an ugly little Troll that looks like a smaller version of the monster from The Crate segment from the fun George A . Romero anthology horror Creepshow ( 1982 ) & the creature effects here are pretty good although it's kept mostly in the shadow's until the end & you can tell it's just a person in a monster suit although to be fair it's a good monster suit . There's not much gore here , there's a burned face & some bright green spraying Troll blood but little else . Monsters : Fools ' Gold is a decent enough way to spend twenty odd minutes but there's not that much to it & the ending isn't very satisfying either , not too bad but not that great either .
497950	1355507	117506	5.0	Inferior remake to a exploitation classic ! Disappointment all round !	Humanoids from the Deep is set in the small American coastal town of ' Harbor Shores ' where ' Canco Industries ' cannery plant is located , lately they have been suffering from protests by environmentalist's who believe that the manager Bill Taylor ( Mark Rolston ) has been dumping chemicals into the sea . Bill's friend Wade Parker ( Robert Carradine ) confronts him about it & is given assurances that no dumping of chemicals is taking place which is a lie as Bill has been dumping a growth hormone called ' Synestin ' into the sea to accelerate the growth of the fish . An attack on a group of activists leaves four missing , including Wade's daughter Kim ( Danielle Weeks ) , & one guy named Matt ( Justin Walker ) talking about sea monsters which no one believes , at first that is anyway . Genetic scientist Dr . Drake ( Emma Samms ) shows up & tells Wade that an army experiment to create amphibious soldiers went wrong & the mutated results are now loose in Harbor Shores . . . Written & directed by Jeff Yonis this was a made-for-cable TV remake of Humanoids from the Deep ( 1980 ) , both were executive produced by Roger Corman . The script changes a few things & not for the better , for a start it brings in the obligatory teen cast , it cuts out all the gore , rape & exploitation from the original & introduces the clichéd army involvement & secret Government experiments as an explanation for the origins of the sea monsters , what I want to know is how Emma Samms kept a straight face as her character explained to Wade that these sea monsters are in fact death-row prisoners whose DNA had been mixed with that of a fish to try & create an amphibious soldier ! This short passage of dialogue has to be heard to be believed , extremely silly & funny sounding stuff . It's a much smaller scale film , in the original it really felt like the whole town was under attack but in this there are only a few basic character's , the introduction of the army doesn't help & I just thought it was a step down from the original on every level . Having said that it moves along at a fair pace , the basic story of raping sea monsters is still the same & if you don't expect too much it provides a fair amount of fun & entertainment . Director Yonis does a pretty decent job & it looks slightly better than the average TV film , there isn't much in the way of scares , tension , shocks or atmosphere . To save money this uses footage from the 1980 original particularly during the scene set in the funfair , it comes as no surprise that our heroes are nowhere to be seen when all the carnage is taking place as they are seemingly stuck in a funhouse as the sea monsters attack outside , this footage is badly edited into the main feature & looks out of place . The gore is severely toned down , a ripped off arm , an Alien ( 1979 ) rip-off monster birth sequence & a guy with one leg missing is about as nasty as it gets . No nudity this time either . Technically Humanoids from the Deep is alright , it was obviously made on a low budget . The monsters themselves look like men in rubber suits because that's what they are although they don't look too bad . The acting was pretty bad . Humanoids from the Deep the remake is not as good as the original in any way but when all said & done I thought it was OK , it certainly passed the time harmlessly enough . Probably just about worth a watch but nothing overly special .
497247	1355507	40068	5.0	Not too bad but not my sort of film .	Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein start as baggage handlers Chick Young ( Bud Abbott ) & Wilbur Grey ( Lou Costello ) are asked to deliver two crates to McDougal's House of Horror wax museum which contain two new exhibits , Dracula ( Bela Lugosi ) & the Frankenstein ( Glenn Strange ) monster . However it turns out that Dracula is alive & brings the Frankenstein monster back to life as well , he teams up with scientist Dr . Sandra Mornay ( Lenore Aubert ) who plans to transplant Wilbur's docile & child like brain into the Frankenstein monster as it can be controlled much more easily to do Dracula's evil bidding . . . Directed by Charles Barton this was the first team up between Universal studios classic monsters & the prolific comedy duo of Bud Abbott & Lou Costello who had appeared in dozens of films together , Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein came at a time when both franchises had been pretty much exhausted & it's a fair light hearted horror comedy with much more emphasis on the comedy while the monsters are there mainly for show . The script by Robert Lees & Frederic Rinaldo was originally called The Brain of Frankenstein & actually has Dracula as the main bad guy of the film , in fact despite the title Abbott & Costello never meet Frankenstein only his monster which doesn't get a lot of use for the majority of the film . Bizarrely the script also throws in the Wolfman for no apparent reason other than to have another classic monster in it . A lot of the comedy in this film is of the physical variety with people falling over things & the like as well as a constant stream of verbal jokes which you may or may not find funny depending on your sense of humour . One has to remember that Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein was made sixty years ago & tastes , attitudes & humour has moved on since then . I'm sure a lot of people won't find this squeaky clean humour that funny & I have to say I didn't but I did like the film on a basic level & at only 80 odd minutes in length I think it's worth a watch & it moves along at a decent pace . Director Barton does alright , the sets are actually quite good & fairly atmospheric & it's a shame in my opinion that the film didn't have a bit more straight forward horror in it . The special effects are alright to although the flapping rubber toy bat on strings looks awful . I wouldn't say there's anything scary here & this is a film that could be enjoyed by all the family . Technically the film is quite impressive considering , it's well made with reasonable effects ( rubber bat apart ) , decent black and white photography & good sets . The acting is OK although I have never seen another Abbott & Costello film so I can't compare this to anything else they have appeared in . This was the final time Bela Lugosi donned the cape as Dracula while the same goes for Lon Chaney Jr . reprising his Wolfman role from The Wolf Man ( 1941 ) . Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein is quite a fun little comedy horror that certainly passes 80 odd minutes but I didn't think the old school humour stands up today & I definitely wouldn't want to watch it again . Proved successful enough to be followed by several more similar themed film including Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man ( 1951 ) , Abbott and Costello Meet Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( 1953 ) & Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy ( 1955 ) .
498093	1355507	25169	5.0	Average but short 30's mystery film .	The Ghost Walks starts late on stormy night as theatrical producer Herman Wood ( Richard Carle ) & his secretary Homer Erskine ( Johnny Arthur ) are being driven from New York to Cragdale by playwright Prescott Ames ( John Miljan ) who is going to read Wood his latest play . However a fallen tree on the road prevents that as their car becomes stranded , the three decide to head to the nearest house for help & shelter . They arrive at a large mansion where Dr . Kent ( Henry Kolker ) lives , he is treating a patient named Beatrice ( Eve Southern ) who has psychological problems after the murder of her husband three years ago in that very mansion . With other assorted guests Ames , Woods & Erskine decide to stay the night but strange things begin to happen & when Beatrice is found dead it seems that there is a killer amongst them . . . Directed by Frank R . Strayer this obscure hard to find old dark haunted house type horror mystery from the 30's is alright but nothing overly special . The script by Charles Belden shoots it's load far too early for my liking , the main plot twist is revealed about 20 minutes in & isn't a bad twist at all but afterwards the films becomes a rather bog standard mystery with an extremely predictable & routine ending which I was surprised the makers went for purely because it is so obvious & because they tried to inject some mystery & suspense in the film which the ending is totally at odds with . Maybe back in the mid 30's audiences hadn't seen too many films like this but then again you would have to be pretty dumb not to figure this one out even back in the 30's . The character's are alright but the comedy relief Woods & his secretary Erskine become extremely annoying , the running gag about being stuck in a play is frankly irritating . On the bright side it only lasts for 63 minutes so at least it's short & sweet , it's watchable I suppose & will pass an hour harmlessly enough but it's not something that I think is anything special or would want to watch again anytime soon . Director Strayer does OK but of course you need to take into account the fact it was made back in the early 30's , just think about that for a moment because that's over 75 years ago . It was released on December 1st 1934 & that's literally a lifetime ago . The scenes set outside at night during a thunderstorm are quite atmospheric but the interior scenes are dull & bland . Unfortunately I think The Ghost Walks is a public domain film & therefore the print is not going to get cleaned up anytime soon , the print quality is atrocious with a huge whacking great white line running down the right hand side of the picture for the first 15 minutes & plenty of scratches , pops , crackles & damage for the rest of it . Even if a big Hollywood company decided to release it would they bother to remaster it ? Would they really spend time , effort & money cleaning the prints up ? I seriously doubt it'll ever happen & therefore The Ghost Walks will probably alway look terrible . Being shot in the 30's this is squeaky clean without any death's , violence or profanity so it's family friendly stuff all the way . Technically the film is fine considering it was made over 75 years ago , the black and white photography is alright although as I've mentioned the quality of the prints make it sometimes hard to sit through . The acting is OK but there are a few wooden performances here , actually now I think about it there's lots of wooden performances . The Ghost Walks is an OK time waster , it passes an hour but I doubt the twists will surprise anyone these days & I doubt it'll live that long in anyone's memory either . If you can actually find a copy & can live with the bad picture quality then it's just about worth a watch .
497351	1355507	681815	5.0	Good episode let down by a terrible ending .	Quincy M . E . : No Way to Treat a Patient starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) meets up with his old friend Tony Carbo ( A Martinez ) who is working at the Sunset Memorial Hospital . While working the late shift a man stumbles in with a gunshot wound to his lower back , Dr . Carbo treats him & sends him off to a bigger better equipped Hospital for an operation . However by the time the man gets there he is dead & suddenly has another bullet wound in his back , the man ends up on Quincy's autopsy table & he can't believe the medical records written by Carbo only list one bullet wound . Not the most popular doctor Carbo is accused of negligence & not noticing the second gunshot wound . . . Episode 22 from season 5 this Quincy story was the final one from the fifth season & it was great until the last few minutes . For the majority of No Way to Treat a Patient there's a pretty good murder mystery & one of Quincy's friends is accused of incompetence so there's a couple of nice plot threads running through the episode but just as it starts to get good & the episode starts to get going we cut to Danny's bar at the end & Quincy merely says the killers were caught & Carbo was cleared . There's no investigation , there's no real detective work & the ending is just very unsatisfying all round as if the production team knew they were running out of time & just had to resolve the episode as quickly as possible . I liked the story about two assassins posing as ambulance drivers too , it's a shame that more couldn't be made of it . There's some funny scenes here , the authoritarian Nurse Miss Russell is played almost entire for laughs & she has a thick Scottish accent & at times sounds like Edward Woodward from The Wicker Man ( 1973 ) ! Her & Quincy's arguing at the start is pure gold . You know I have always been surprised that more character's don't return to Quincy but here in No Way to Treat a Patient I think one does , or then again maybe he doesn't . You see Quincy & Dr . Carbo recognise each other & even mention the University , Dr . Carbo is played by A Martinez who starred in the Quincy two parter Walk Softly Through the Night ( 1979 ) from season four in which he played a student studying to become a doctor in University but in those two episodes his character's name was Marty Herrera so why the change of name ? Is he meant to be the same character or not ? If not why did Quincy recognise him & why is it made clear that they knew each other ? Strange . In this episode we get some good location footage of Sunset Strip with it's bright neon signs ( one clearly advertising ' Filthy Magazines ' ! ) , prostitutes , pimps & a strip club called The Purple Peacock ! A real document of the time , I doubt it's like that anymore . The acting is alright , oddly Quincy isn't in this one that much as there's a large twenty odd minute gap during the middle where he doesn't appear at all . No Way to Treat a Patient had potential & was going really well until one of the most abrupt endings ever , it's still worth a watch but you will feel that a large chunk of it is missing .
499080	1355507	102067	5.0	Average name only 5th sequel , could have been much better .	A mysterious British drifter named Ian Richards ( Brendan Hughes ) wanders into the small desolate town of Canton Bluff in Southern California . After a run in with the local Sheriff named Fuller ( Gary Cervantes as Carlos Cervantes ) he finds work with the towns Reverend named Dewey ( Jered Barclay ) fixing up his run-down church . Soon after Ian's arrival , a carnival called ' Harker's world of wonder ' rolls into town . The owner R . B . Harker ( Bruce Payne ) collects freaks and shows them off to the paying public , along with various other lame fairground attractions that try to please any potential customer . Harker's latest freak is a man named Winston ( Sean Gregory Sullivan ) who has a deformity that makes his skin look like lizard scales , Harker decides to call him ' Alligator Boy ' . At first the locals of Canton Bluff seem to enjoy Harker's carnival . Ian decides to take Dewey's daughter Elizabeth ( Michele Matheson ) to the opening night . They meet Harker . Harker feels he knows Ian but cannot remember from where or when . Harker tells one of his workers , Bellamey ( Antonio Fargas ) to spy on Ian . That night the full moon causes Ian to change into a werewolf which Bellamey sees and reports back to Harker . Harker captures Ian and puts him in his freak-show . Also that night Miss Eddington ( Carol Lynley ) who owns the town's bank , disappears . The town's mayor Roger Pruitt ( Randy Pelish ) and the locals believe Ian is responsible . But it seems that Harker himself isn't quite what he appears to be at first and is in Canton Bluff for rather more sinister reasons than he leads everyone to thinks . Who is Harker ? Who is Ian ? Why are they both in Canton Bluff ? What secrets do they hide ? Who will be able to halt the sudden and somewhat startling decline in the town's population ? Watch it if you want to find out . Directed by Hope Perello this is the fifth very loosely connected sequel to the Howling ( 1981 ) and was made between Howling V : The Rebirth ( 1989 ) and Howling : New Moon Rising ( 1995 ) . As it stands Howling VI : The Freaks ain't actually that bad a film , it's just that it's not a particularly good one either . The script by Kevin Rock supposedly based on the novels by Gary Brandner ( the film gives him a ' based on ' credit at the beginning ) is just too slow . The story definitely has potential which , in my opinion , has not been fulfilled or realised for the most part . The filmmakers should have had more confidence in their abilities and should have been more adventurous as this film could have been really good , there are good parts here and there but their too few and far between , which is a shame . If this had been cut down by around 10 or 15 minutes it would have flowed a lot better and kept my interest more . Or , alternatively the filmmakers could have written in a few more horror sequences . It's over half and hour into the film before any horror of any description happens . Prior to this it's character development and exposition , like letting the viewer know that the town is holding mayoral elections which in the eventual context of the film as a whole means absolutely nothing and past the opening few minutes it's never mentioned again . The special make-up effects are surprisingly impressive , especially Winston's lizard make-up and Harker's cool vampire make-up . There isn't much blood or gore , a chicken has it's head bitten off and a torture scene where someone is poked with a spike . Vampire Harker's final death sequence is also quite cool and impressive looking . The acting is OK with Bruce Payne's performance as the main villain Harker being quite enjoyable . The film is generally well made , not outstanding but perfectly acceptable under the low-budget circumstance's . Having said that the low-budget comes through when Harker captures Ian and locks him in a cage . The cage is supposed to be made from iron bars but whenever someone touches one they wobble , shake or bend rather easily considering their supposed to be solid iron . Don't lose any sleep if you haven't seen it as it's not that good but you could do a lot worse . Worth watching if you can catch it on T . V . for free or buy it on DVD cheap . I will give it a respectable but unspectacular .
498633	1355507	71222	5.0	Horrendously overrated as far as I'm concerned .	Black Christmas is set in a girls sorority house around Christmas , one of the girls Clare Harrison ( Lynne Griffin ) is spending the festive season with her father at home but is brutally killed in her room before she meets up with him . The next morning & her dad ( James Edmond ) raises the alarm & contacts the police who organise a search where they find the dead body of a young child , meanwhile the sorority house has been receiving obscene phone calls which they tell the police about . Lieutenant Fuller ( John Saxon ) decides all the clues point the the sorority house with very good reason as there's a killer on the loose inside . . . This Canadian production was produced & directed by Bob Clark & I have to say I think Black Christmas is vastly overrated , considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made I'd personally say it's more of a thriller although I can see why some would say that . The script by Ray Moore is very serious & tries to build tension up & remain quite taught but I have to say I was pretty bored by it . It takes ages to do anything & then we get the god awful ending , some people complain about horror films not having much of a story & Black Christmas would almost certainly give those people more ammunition as the killer is never seen , the killer's motives are never revealed neither is the basic question of who he is . I'm sorry but even Jason Voorhees & Freddy Kruger had back stories , at least they had some sort of motive no matter how flimsy it was while here in Black Christmas there is nothing . Some may like the ambiguity & sure it works well enough for most of the film but I'd have liked some sort of pay-off , some sort of explanation , some sort of twist , some sort of story behind the killer & a proper ending , you see Black Christmas doesn't so much as end as just stops . On the plus the plus side it's watchable , the character's are good & more human than in a lot of horror films although for me that's just not enough to want to sit through 100 minutes of this again . Since it was Chritsmas Day only a few days ago Black Christmas was an appropriate film to sit down & watch last night & director Clark does a really good job here & the films best asset is it's atmosphere & style , there are some great point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective & there's definitely a creepy chilly atmosphere to it . The film looks quite gritty & is far less glossy than the average Hollywood flick which helps it as well but despite some good visuals & a nice dark atmosphere I still didn't like the story & that's what really sinks Black Christmas for me . The body count is low & there's absolutely zero gore . Was it just me or did anyone else have problems understanding the obscene phone calls ? I mean the guy speaking sounding like he was doing a bad Donald Duck impression ! The ending doesn't work either on a factual level , the cops wouldn't leave Jessica alone in the house after what she had just gone through & considering what had just taken place they wouldn't have left the house anyway let alone not even bother searching the attic . Technically the film is well made & is pretty impressive , shot on location in Toronto , Ontario in Canada . The acting is fine , the likes of Kier Dullea , Ovlia Hussey , Margot Kidder & genre favourite John Saxon put in good performances . Black Christmas is considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made which I can see why while other's claim it's the best slasher ever made which I can't agree with at all as I think it's one of the most overrated , I'm not saying it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination it's just one that I personally didn't like & can't see why so many people do despite their reasoning . Remade by Hollywood as Black Christmas ( 2006 ) which I actually prefer as it has more of a story .
497574	1355507	681872	5.0	Average Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Unreasonable Doubt starts as Lillian Preston ( Kres Mersky ) arrives home with her baby son Charlie after visiting a doctor about his rare condition Sturge Weber disease , visibly upset her husband Jerry ( Jim Antonio ) puts Chalie down on a metal tray & goes to comfort her . By the time Jerry gets back an electrical wire from a TV being repaired has electrocuted Charlie , since Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is an old friend of Jerry it is decided to give the autopsy to Walter Ross ( John Rubinstein ) who comes to the conclusion that Charlie was deliberately electrocuted & the fact he had Sturge Weber disease meant there was no way he could have freed the wire that killed him . Quincy refuses to believe it & sets out to prove that Jerry didn't kill his own son but the evidence against him is strong . . . Episode 5 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Richard Benedict & is better than that which has come before during season 8 but still not exactly brilliant . At least Quincy gets to investigate something this time & use his medical skills & knowledge to uncover the truth even if the truth ends up being a bit dull & some might say a touch predictable . The episode moves along at a nice enough pace & features an attempt to say something about the pressure of father's on their son's which gets a bit lost but there just had to be a moral issue somewhere . This episode also features a handicapped pathologist although while he walks around on crutches & at times is confined to a wheelchair absolutely nothing is made of it & it isn't even mentioned , his disability is screaming at you in the face from the screen as you can't miss it but the story completely ignores it which is strange . I mean why have a disabled pathologist & then do absolutely nothing with him or his condition ? Unreasonable Doubt is an OK time waster if there's nothing else on the other sides but it's hardly classic Quincy . This episode looks alright , Quincy's soon to be wife Dr . Emily Hanover ( Anita Gillette ) gets a few seconds in this one . The regular cast members besides Quincy seem to be getting less & less screen time & I really don't like what's happening with the show here . Unreasonable Doubt is the best story so far in season 8 , it isn't classic Quincy but it's more like the old days if you know what I mean .
498203	1355507	82804	5.0	Fairly entertaining haunted house horror film .	Lauren Cochran ( Robin Groves ) is a writer who lives in New York City and lately has been suffering from anxiety attacks , which her Doctor , Webb ( Patrick Farrelly ) put down to a condition called agoraphobia , which is a fear of leaving the house . Lauren decides to escape Manhattan and head to a small town called Dover Falls to finish her current novel . Her friend Mark Felton ( Christopher Loomis ) drives her to Dover Falls . They stop by the side of the road , take a break and stretch their legs . Lauren comes across an unusual large octagonal house that she feels she knows . It's exactly the same house she wrote about in one of her previous books entitled ' The Nesting ' . And that the cover illustration on the book that she described for the artist to draw is precisely the same as this house she is looking at now , even though she has never been there before . She immediately decides to rent the property . She makes arrangements with the house's owner , a Colonel Lebrun ( John Carradine ) and his grandson Daniel Griffith ( Micheal David Lally ) and moves in straight away . That night Lauren has a dream about the house , or was it a hallucination or possibly even ghosts ? While visiting , Dr . Webb has an ' accident ' and is killed . The local handyman Frank Beasley ( Bill Rowley ) is mysteriously drowned after trying to attack Lauren . More strange things happen , record players start on their own , words are mysteriously typed onto her work and Lauren continues to see strange people who seem able to just appear and disappear at will . She decides to investigate the house's history , and talks with a local farmer called Abner Welles ( David Tabor ) who becomes violent towards her when questioned about the house . Lauren becomes more and more unsure if what she has experienced is real , hallucinatory or if indeed there are ghosts inhabiting the house . Co-written and directed by Armand Weston I thought this was a decent enough haunted house horror film . The script by Weston and Daria Price takes quite a long time to establish the situation and is fairly slow going at times . But I have to say it kept me pretty interested and watching right through to the end . One thing that disappointed me was the lacklustre ending , after all the build-up I was hoping for something a little more substantial than what was offered , it just ends up being a bit of a let down and rather pedestrian . Robin Groves was good in the leading role , but I thought Micheal David Lally was awful . There's not much gore in it , just a scythe whacked into someones face , someone is impaled and some gunshot wounds at the end . There's a bit of nudity , but not much . The film looks OK and has a decent atmosphere to it , and the octagonal house is both unusual and cool , I don't think I've ever seen another house like it . If you don't mind a horror film with a slightly slow pace then you could do a lot worse than this , but then I suppose you could probably do a lot better as well . Worth watching , if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on T . V . for free .
497616	1355507	114367	5.0	" Are you coming . . . or are you just breathing hard ? " Average sci-fi / horror .	Screamers is set on the war ravaged mining planet of Sirius 6B during the year 2078 , a group of rebellious miners who call themselves the ' Alliance ' revolted against their company N . E . B . or the New Economic Block when it was discovered that the revolutionary fuel they were mining for them called Berynium produced lethal amounts of radioactive gas & as a result a long 10 year war between the two has raged . Joe Hendricksson ( Peter Weller ) is the commander of the Alliance when one day a lone N . E . B . soldier ( Sylvain Masse ) hand delivers a plea for peace & to set up a meeting . Soon after a N . E . B . spacecraft crashes near the Alliance's headquarter's which contained soldiers & weapons on their way to another planet rich in Berynium , the N . E . B . were going to leave everyone else on Sirius 6B to rot as a new source of Berynium has been found . Hendricksson decides to head to the N . E . B . base & discuss terms with whoever is left & takes the one & only survivor from the crash Jefferson ( Andrew Lauer ) along with him . Once there they discover almost everyone slaughtered & the few survivors talking of killer robots left over from the war known as Screamers that have evolved to mimic a human being perfectly , trusting anyone suddenly becomes very difficult . . . This Canadian , American & Japanese co-production was directed by Christian Duguay & is an average sci-fi horror at best . The script by Dan O'Bannon & Miguel Tejada-Flores was based on the short story ' Second Variety ' by Philip K . Dick & to be honest it feels like it as there just wasn't enough of a story here to maintain my interest . For a start Screamers is far too slow , after a promising opening scene things settle down & plod along for the next 90 odd minutes & I just found it very difficult to get excited about anything in Screamers . Don't get me wrong as I don't think it's not without some merit but I thought it was pretty forgettable stuff . The character's are clichéd , the situations they find themselves in are & various other films have more than a passing influence on Screamers like The Thing ( 1982 ) & the mistrust of each other , lots of soldiers with guns in futuristic settings reminds of Aliens ( 1986 ) & robotic killing machines mimicking people was done decades earlier ( & better ) in The Terminator ( 1984 ) . There is also a fair bit of political nonsense & a slightly over complicated war that seemed a bit too complex . Director Duguay does a pretty good job , some of the snow covered , post apocalyptic wasteland landscapes give Screamers a nice atmosphere & feel to it with some really good matte painting as well . The action scenes are flat & not very exciting unfortunately , just imagine lots of people running around in dark corridors . Screamers could have done with some decent action scenes , the opening sequence of the N . E . B . soldier being sliced ' n ' diced by a Screamer is as good as it gets . There is also a disappointing lack of gore , a few severed limbs & some splashes of blood is as good as it gets . With a supposed budget of about $20 , 000 , 000 I have to admit that I would liked to have seen more on screen , there are no big name actors , no big action scenes , limited special effects , limited locations & a few run down factory locations . As a whole 20 big ones seems like a lot of money considering the end product . The acting was OK but no one will remember Weller for anything other than Robocop ( 1987 ) will they ? Screamers is an OK film , it's generally well made with that Hollywood polish to it but I found it rather forgettable , a bit dull & lacklustre . Don't expect an all guns blazing sci-fi shoot-'em-up because Screamers isn't it , watch Aliens again instead as it's far superior in every way .

Written & directed by Stephen Carpenter a lot of people seem to hate Soul Survivors which is fair enough , there's absolutely nothing that says anyone has to like it in any way shape or form but I have to say I did actually like it to a degree . Originally made as an ' R ' rated film Soul Survivors was cut down to get a ' PG-13 ' & thus appeal to a larger audience with the obligatory uncut version ( called the ' The Killer Cut ' ) being released on DVD shortly after , I will be basing my comments on the original shorter theatrical cut . The script has a few interesting ideas that I liked , I never quite knew what the makers were aiming for as it seems to switch between a psychological supernatural horror & a plain teen slasher ( it starts off like a carbon copy of I Know What You Did Last Summer ( 1997 ) with a car accident involving drunk teens ) & I quite liked the unpredictability of it . At just over eighty odd minutes at least it's short , it's not the quickest film ever or even the most incident packed but it kept me interested throughout . I liked the character's & the mystery based plot had me fairly intrigued & I definitely wanted to know how it was going to finish . While watching Soul Survivors I suspect many people just thought it was various unconnected subplots that go nowhere & make no sense but I thought the ending was great & while it's a bit silly & maybe a bit of a cop out I thought it explained all the mysterious events neatly & tidily enough . I was going to say that Soul Survivors stole it's twist ending from Dead End ( 2003 ) but then I realised Soul Survivors was made two years prior , in fact both twist endings are basically exactly the same but since Soul Survivors came first I have to give this film the credit for it . Director Carpenter does alright , there could have been a few more scares & more gore ( even ' The Killer Cut ' is supposedly pretty tame & bloodless ) but it sure does look good with some great cinematography . Although having said that I brought a new High Definition Sony telly yesterday & Soul Survivors was the first film I had seen on it so maybe it was just the sheer quality of the picture that impressed me , it did look bloody good though . There are some lesbian overtones but like the gore they are played down & very tame . With a supposed budget of about $14 , 000 , 000 Soul Survivors flopped at the box-office but it has good production values & is very well made . Filmed largely in Cicago in Illinois . The acting is alright , I quite liked all the character's & the young teen actors are suitably good looking . Soul Survivors is a film that most people seem to dislike , I wasn't expecting much at all with it's bad reputation but I actually ended up rather liking it for some strange reason I can't quite put my finger on .
498283	1355507	460898	5.0	As low brow as a film can get .	Pervert ! starts as James ( Sean Andrews ) arrives at his father's ranch after a term in college , he plans to stay there for the summer . His father Hezekiah ( Darrell Sandeen ) has shacked up with the ample chested young girl Cheryl ( Mary Carey ) who happens to be young enough to be his daughter , James & Cheryl quickly fall for each other & have sex , lots of it . Hezekiah finds out , the next morning & Cheryl has mysteriously disappeared . Hezekiah quickly finds another young girl Alisha ( Sally Jean ) , she to falls for his son James & she too disappears although both her's & Cheryl's dead bodies eventually turn up much to Hezekiah's & James ' surprise . Who , or what killed them & why ? Co-produced & directed by Jonathan Yudis who also appears in the film as the greasy gay car mechanic this is an unashamed homage , or rip-off whichever way you look at it , of the exploitation / sexploitation films of the 70's & 80's & I can see how some might like it but I personally didn't think much of it . The script by co-producer Mike Davis certainly tries to pack in as many bad taste gags , bare breasts , nudity , sex , cheap looking gore & silly plot twists in it's slight 80 odd minute duration as it can which in a way makes it watchable on a stupid juvenile level . If you think the idea of seeing a pretty girl torturing a man by sticking her bum in his face & farting , watching a big burly man ( played by director Yudis ) literally drop kick his young son like he was a football or seeing an evil stop-motion animated penis with a face trying to murder people sounds funny then you'll love Pervert ! , if however you like your entertainment with a little more class then this is not the film for you . At just over 80 minutes it moves along at a fast pace , I will admit there's always something happening as it's pretty successful at what it sets out to do . Unfortunately I didn't like the pre pubescent jokes which are a naughty school boys dream come true , I have to say I didn't laugh once during Pervert ! & in fact I didn't even smile either . Take away all the silliness & homages the actual story is terrible with some awful plot twists & character's . Director Yudis shoots this on what looks like a camcorder , it's certainly not shot on film . There are loads of naked female breasts although no full frontal nudity . The blood & gore isn't anything to shout about , there's a decapitated head & some very watery looking blood . The film is quite annoying to watch at times , there's loads of comedy sound effects , stupid editing , random shots of naked women that have nothing to do with anything & pretty low production values . I'd have thought this was pretty low budget , no one of any note is in it & it looks cheap with a terrible looking sop-motion animated penis . I kid you not . The acting is rubbish , I didn't recognise anyone in it although I wouldn't be surprised if some of the girls in this were better know for porn film . Pervert ! can be quite fun in a really low brow juvenile camp sort of way , as a dramatic film it's absolutely worthless though & apart from the exploitation / bad movie crowd this isn't going to really appeal to anyone . I thought it was worth a one off watch but I doubt I'll want to see it again .
498172	1355507	330793	5.0	Nothing special , I prefer the Lundgren version from the late 80's .	The Punisher starts as an illegal arms deal goes bad & Bobby Saint ( James Carpinello ) is shot dead by Federal Agents , it was all a set-up & poor old Bobby has ended up in a body bag because of it . The operation was set up by FBI agent Frank Castle ( Thomas Jane ) & Bobby happens to the son of a powerful & wealthy underworld banker named Howard Saint ( John Travolta ) & when Howard learns of Castle he orders his men to kill Castle & his entire family . Howard's men manage to kill Castle's family but not Frank himself who decides to become a vigilante & go it alone in order to punish those responsible for the brutal slaying of his entire family , it's a long dark , bloody & death filled road but it's one Frank is determined to walk down in pursuit of justice . . . This American German co-production was co-written & directed by Jonathan Hensleigh who manages to turn in a film that is strictly average , it should be noted that since the theatrical version was released an extended by 20 odd minutes cut has been released on DVD & I will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical cut as I haven't seen the extended one . The script by Hensleigh & Michael France is based on the Marvel comic book character & strangely doesn't feel like a comic book film at all , the Punisher as a character has no superpowers like say Spider-Man or Superman & even the action scenes are relatively low & disappointingly un-comic book like . I was hoping for huge over-the-top set-pieces & action scenes which never came , as a whole The Punisher feels very much like a routine ' one man army on a revenge mission ' action thriller of which there are countless examples out there . The only distinguishing feature of the Punisher himself is his skull motif on his shirt & that's it . The film is utterly predictable as well with the viewer knowing from the first frame that Castle will kill all the bad guy's & avenge his dead family . The character's aren't great , the three comedy relief teenagers who live near Castle feel out of place , Howard Saint is given no background & Castle himself just doesn't seem that cut up about his family . Director Hensleigh does alright but there's nothing particularly special in The Punisher , the action scenes are well choreographed & there's plenty of blood & dead bodies flying around but there's no ' big ' comic book action scenes here & apart from one or two cool looking guns , a bow & arrow & a butterfly knife the weaponry is also rather dull & routine looking . I personally think The Punisher ( 1988 ) staring Dolph Lundgren is far superior to this , despite the lower budget the action scenes are better , it's better paced & less boring , the villains are better , the weaponry from ninja throwing stars to samurai swords to sawn off shotguns to deadly razor sharp earrings are much more fun & feels much more like a comic book as is the film as a whole . In fact I can't think of one aspect of the new Punisher that I liked more than the Lundgren one , I even preferred his beat up old motorbike he drives around on rather than the car he has in this . The violence isn't that excessive , there's plenty of dead bodies , someone gets a knife stuck under their chin & someone gets an arrow through their neck . I was a bit surprised to learn that The Punisher only had a budget of about $15 , 500 , 000 which isn't a lot of money , in fact until recently Steven Seagal's straight-to-video efforts have had higher budgets . Shot in Florida this is well made but not particularly stylish & the only time it tries to be when an explosion caused by the Punisher causes flames in the shape of his skull motif just look silly . The acting is OK , I'm not sure what Travolta is doing in this & I'm not sure how much he was paid as for his previous film Basic ( 2003 ) & one of his next Ladder 49 ( 2004 ) he was paid $20 , 000 , 000 each which is more than the entire budget for The Punisher ! The Punisher is a bit of a disappointment , this could have been a entertaining & ultra violent action flick with a cool comic book feel but instead it feels like a standard average budget revenge flick . Watch the ' 88 Punisher instead as it's a better film in every respect in my opinion . The sequel The Punisher : Welcome Back , Frank ( 2008 ) has been made & will be out soon , probably straight-to-video .
498388	1355507	403885	5.0	" I never ask a question that I don't know the answer to . " I didn't think it was too bad .	Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill starts as five college kids , Gwen ( Chelsea Jean ) , Mandy ( Denise Boutte ) , Sondra ( Kandis Erickson ) , Jerry ( Matt Marraccini ) & Buck ( Steve Glinn ) plus they're teacher Avery ( Scott Carson ) set off across country to Phoenix . En-route they are taken hostage by a drug dealer named Earl ( Gregory Bastien ) who is looking for his fellow drug dealer Darrel ( Dean N . Arevalo ) whom he thinks has ripped him off . They find Darrel's car & follow the road to a old town called Sunset Valley where they find Darrel injured & covered in blood , he warns them to leave but before they can they are all attacked by a horde of flesh eating zombies lead by evil Confederate soldier William Anderson AKA Bloody Bill ( Jeremy Bouvet ) who has placed a curse on the town & it's residents for his & his sister's executions centuries ago . It's either the flesh eating zombies or the kids & it's a fight to the death . . . Photographed & directed by Byron Werner I thought Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill was an OK low budget zombie film . The script moves along at a fair pace & entertains on a basic level . It isn't anywhere near the likes of Night of the Living dead ( 1968 ) or Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) in terms of quality but it does it's best . The character's are the typical bunch of stranded would-be victims as they eventually start to argue & bicker at each other as the situation becomes ever worse & their number begins to dwindle . Of course you don't really go into a film such as this expecting high art or a meaningful story which is just as well because this definitely isn't high art & certainly doesn't have a meaningful story . Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill is one of those films that if you turn your brain off , can ignore a few rough edges & don't set your expectations too high can be enjoyed in a dumb mindless sort of way . It ain't exactly brilliant but it ain't too bad either . Director Werner tries all the flashy & somewhat annoying editing tricks there is , bleached colours , slow-mo , fast-mo , frame skipping & quick cuts . The special effects aren't that great but I've seen worse , there's no real scares , tension or atmosphere probably because it's set entirely during the day which doesn't help the ambiance , does it ? One aspect of Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill that I hated was the music , it was absolutely awful & there were times that I pressed mute on my TV remote control because it was giving me a headache . There is also a stupid bit with a grenade , I mean that grenade would have done more damage than cause a bit of smoke , I mean it was a wooden house it would have set in on fire at least , wouldn't it ? The gore is tame & lacking , there's a couple of flesh eating scenes , there's a decapitated zombie head & a few gun shot wounds , I was pretty disappointed with the gore levels here to be honest . Technically Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill is OK , it's nothing special but considering the low budget it could have been worse . It looks like it was shot on a digital camcorder like a lot of low budget horror films are these days , personally I really don't like how these digitally shot films look & I much prefer proper good old fashioned film . The acting sucked , but then what did you expect ? Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill is an average low budget horror film that isn't exactly spectacular but it's sort of watchable in it's own crap way , I doubt I'll ever want to see it again though . Worth a watch if your bored & have lots ( & I mean lots ) of love for the horror genre .
499233	1355507	66160	6.0	" There are many other interesting things in our village , like our peaceful little cemetery . " Watchable enough Euro horror .	La Noche de Walpurgis , or the ridiculous sounding The Werewolf Vs . Vampire Woman or the better sounding but still irrelevant Werewolf Shadow as it's known amongst English speaking audiences , starts at a local mortuary where Dr . Hartwig ( Julio Pena ) & his assistant Muller ( Bernabe Barta Barri ) are carrying out a postmortem on Waldemar Daninsky ( Jacinto Molina under his usual pseudonym Paul Naschy ) a suspected Werewolf who has been shot with silver bullets . After removing the bullets Daninsky comes back to life as a werewolf , attacks Hartwig & Muller then kills a local girl . Meanwhile a student named Elvira ( Gaby Fuchs ) is writing an essay on black-magic , witchcraft & in particular a Countess Wandessa d'Arville da Nadasdy ( Patty Shepard ) whom was said to be a Vampire & Satan worshipper 100's of years ago . Together with her friend Genevieve ( Barbara Capell ) & a document which reveals where Wandessa's tomb is located Elvira travels to a remote part of North France & bumps into Waldemar who offers the two women a place to stay . It's not long before things take a turn for the worse as Waldmar's mentally disturbed sister Elizabeth ( Yelena Samarina ) warns them to leave the area , they discover blood stained walls & manacles in the shed , Waldemar somehow isn't as he appears & when Wandessa's tomb is opened she is resurrected form the dead to terrorise the local area once again with various bodies turning up having been drained of blood . . . This Spanish German co-production was directed by Leon Klimovsky & isn't as bad as I was anticipating , it's far from a masterpiece but I thought it was a fairly decent way to pass an hour & a half . The version I saw was the Anchor Bay DVD with the extra few minutes of dialogue that was obviously never dubbed into English & therefore is presented in Spanish with subtitles , this extra footage adds nothing & in fact I'd prefer to have not had this put back in as it slows the pace of the film down & is frankly boring . Anyway , the script by star Molina as James Molin ( how many pseudonym's does this guy have ? ) & Hans Munkel has plenty of the elements that most rabid Euro horror fans will be looking for like Vampires , Werewolves , blood , superstitious locals , pretty girls , idiotic dialogue & nudity . Hey , what more do you want ? A decent coherent story perhaps ? The character's are dull & don't act in the way a normal human being would in the situations they find themselves in , I didn't buy the relationship between Daninsky & Elvira for a second & it just seemed so fake & contrived . The various themes & ideas in La Noche de Walpurgis come & go without much regard for continuity , the Werewolf & Vampires appear sporadically throughout often being completely forgotten about for long period's . Having said that that the film moves a long at a nice pace & never really becomes boring ( expect at the end but that's the extra footage for you ) with a decent amount of monster action although the climatic fight at the end is nothing more than two people rolling around on the floor . Director Klimovsky manges to create some great scenes & atmosphere with the Vampires moving in slow motion & for some reason he has them jump off something whenever they appear , I also liked Wandessa's outfit with her black veil . On the down side the constant day-for-night shots become irritating & undo some of his good work . I loved the locations used , the Church ruins & local architecture is fantastic & gives La Noche de Walpurgis a really nice look that the film itself doesn't deserve . Technically the film is solid with nice production values , cinematography , music & special effects . There are some gore scenes here , a woman is bitten on the neck with lots of her blood running over her naked breasts , a couple of stakes through the heart , some Vampirism & neck biting , a decapitation & a melting Vampire . The acting is obviously lessened by the bad English dub but it probably wasn't any good anyway , leading ladies Fuchs & Capell are both very attractive if you know what I mean . . . I quite liked La Noche de Walpurgis , it's far from the best Euro horror I've ever seen but it's far from the worst . It's simple , silly & slightly uneven story entertains to an extent but it isn't going to stay with you for that long afterwards . If your a Euro horror or Naschy fan than it's definitely worth a watch , for those who aren't would be advised that there are better alternatives out there .
499097	1355507	78749	6.0	I didn't think I would but despite it's many faults I actually quite liked it for what it was !	The version I watched was a UK tape called Alien Terror . A couple named Thelma ( Belinda Mayne ) and Roy ( Mark Bodin ) are keen potholers and along with six of their friends , Bert ( Michele Soavi ) Maureen ( Judy Perrin , this is where the credit information on the IMDb stops and the film doesn't list the characters on the credits ) , Jill , Bill , Cliff and Rod are planning a weekend exploring some caves somewhere in the Californian wilderness . As they drive out of the city ( the closing credits mentions San Diego so maybe that's where these city shots were filmed ) the local T . V . and radio news shows report that a space capsule returning from space has crash landed in the Ocean and it's crew are missing . The potholers stop at a roadside café and Bert ( the idiot of the group ) takes a slash against a wall and notices a strange blue football sized rock , he picks it up and gives it to Thelma , oh and by the way Thelma is a psychic and she has a ' bad ' feeling . Once deep inside the cave they all have a good time until Jill and Thelma goes off on their own . Jill notices the blue thing in Thelma's rucksack is pulsating . Jill grabs it and has a closer look , it bursts open and something attach's itself to her face . Next thing we know Thelma is screaming for help , she explains to the others that Jill has fallen off a ledge and is lying hurt at the bottom . Everyone rushes to help her . Rod is left up top to operate the stretcher and crane to lift her up . Once Jill is up top her face splits open and a snake like alien thing emerges . Rod is taken by surprise and the alien attach's itself to his throat . Rod falls back and his feet get caught in some rope , as he hangs there over the edge the alien does something that makes his head fall off . The others below watching this are understandably shaken and even worse are trapped in the lower levels of the cave . They must use all their experience and know how to find a way out and survive the Alien Terror ! Written , produced and directed by Ciro Ippolito under the pseudonym Sam Cromwell , rumour has it Umberto Lenzi might have been involved too . I have to admit I actually quite liked it , it has it's faults for sure and it certainly isn't a masterpiece but for what it was I thought it was an hour and a half well spent . The script drags a little in places and some of the dialogue is as absurd as we've come to expect from these 80's Italian produced low-budget horror films , but that's half their charm and entertainment . The ending was strange and somewhat of a let-down , nothing is really explained or concluded properly and just sort of ends suddenly it also went on for too long and would have been better served a few minutes shorter , Thelma's apparent psychic powers are never really made use of except her ' feelings ' that she has . I liked the cave setting , I thought it was quite unusual and for the most part helped to create an atmosphere of isolation . The acting isn't up to much but then I didn't really expect it to be . There is some pretty good gore sequences in this too , Rods head oozing off and some of his insides following it down out of his neck stump is a definite highlight as is Jills face splitting open just prior , the special make-up effects are decent enough too . The aliens themselves are never really seen in their entirety , I felt there should be a big alien at the end ( we get an alien point-of-view camera shot that towers above Thelma ) but we never see ' it ' . Mostly they look like mutant snake things . A special mention goes to Guido De Angelis & Maurizio De Angelis who provide the music and hide under the wonderful pseudonym of Oliver Onions ! I don't really know why but this is one of those films that should be absolutely awful , and probably is to most people , but for some unexplainable reason I liked it . It's a film that for me has a indefinable ' X ' factor . Impossible to recommend to the casual viewer and it's probably quite difficult to track down , but there are much worse out there .
498463	1355507	650900	6.0	The one with Meat Loaf as a mad scientist .	Monsters : Where's the Rest of Me ? is set on a civil war torn Caribbean island where scientist Doctor Willard Wingite ( Meat Loaf ) lives & conducts his groundbreaking if somewhat unethical organ transplant experiments . Joining him there are three of his success stories , singer Regina ( Black-Eyed Susan ( ! ) ) who had her vocal chords replaced , star football player Joe ( Franco Harris ) who had a new knee & property mogul J . J . ( Drew Eliot ) whose sight was restored by Wingite with a cornea transplant . Doctor Wingite urges the three to invest in his organ preservation serum which they are happy to do , but the original donor of the various body parts is still alive in Wingite's laboratory thanks to the serum & wants his missing organs back . . . Episode six from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during November 1988 , written & directed by Richard Benner this a pretty good mad scientist / Frankenstein themed episode of the horror anthology show Monsters that in all fairness probably is closer to Re-Animator ( 1985 ) than Frankenstein but you get the general idea . Like all of these twenty odd minute episodes of Monsters this episode finishes just as your getting into it but Where's the Rest of Me ? is good ghoulish fun while it last's & I liked it , I liked that the zombie here actually had some motivation & a purpose as it tried to get it's stolen organs back including a gory demise for rock singer Meat Loaf who here looks quite slim . The character's are alright but Wingite remains a little bit too calm for me & are you telling me he wasn't aware that giving Adam the corpse a load of his serum would have revived him ? There's a sub-plot about a revolution going on in the background on the island which doesn't amount to much to be fair . A good episode overall with some nice gore although once the plot reveals that Adam is after his stolen organs it's pretty predictable for the most part but the ending is still quite good & rounds things off nicely . It's amazing how the production team of Monsters made so much out of such meagre resources , here there's only two sets & five people in the entire thing but it works & you don't feel there needs to be anything else . The sets that are here look good & I think there's a definite nod towards Re-Animator with it's bright green life giving serum although one has to say Meat Loaf is no Jeffrey Combs . Here Meat Loaf wears a horrible white suit , red shirt & multi-coloured tie which would have been bad enough on it's own but Meat Loaf also has a ponytail as well just to top the look off . Meat Loaf has actually been in a few horror anthology show's including this , What's Cookin ' ( 1992 ) from Tales from the Crypt , Gettysburg ( 2000 ) from The Outer Limits & Pelts ( 2006 ) from Masters of Horror . There's a bit of gore here including a cut out knee cap , poked out eyeballs & a ripped out heart . Where's the Rest of Me ? is a watchable mad scientist Frankenstein style Monsters episode that I actually liked , there was a decent enough story , the main monster had purpose & the two sets look rather nice . A good solid episode , by no means the best but nowhere near the worst .
499150	1355507	106449	6.0	OK horror anthology .	Body Bags starts in a morgue where the attendant ( John Carpenter ) enjoys his job , he particularly likes the stiffs that come in in black body bags for they contain the murder , accident & suicide victims . Each one seems to have they're own morbid tale of how they ended up on the coroners autopsy table . . . Jump to Haddonfield where our first story titled ' The Gas Station ' is set . A serial killer is on the loose & new gas station employee Anne ( Alex Datcher ) is preparing for a long lonely night-shift . Anne becomes increasingly paranoid about everyone who turns up believing any of them may be a serial killer . . . The next body belongs to a someone who committed suicide in a story called ' Hair ' . Richard Coberts ( Stacy Keach ) is losing his hair & it's ruining his life , confidence & self esteem . Wanting to impress his girlfriend Megan ( Sheena Easton ) he contacts Dr . lock ( David Warner ) who promises a miracle hair regrowth treatment , unfortunately the procedure has some unexpected & very much unwanted side-effects . . . The final segment is entitled ' Eye ' & features pro baseball player Brent Matthews ( Mark Hamil ) who appears to have an almost perfect life , that is until he is involved in a car accident in which he loses his right eye . However Dr . Lang ( John Agar ) has spent the past 10 years of his life perfecting an eye transplant & Brent becomes the first beneficiary of the treatment , unfortunately the operation is not without it's problems . . . Featuring & co-executive produced by John Carpenter who also co-composed the music & directed two of the three segments , The Gas Station & Hair while Tobe Hooper directed Eye & he also has a small cameo in the film at the very end . I generally really like anthologies & Body Bags is fair entertainment I suppose but it could have been so much more . The first story The Gas Station is predictable & feels more like a slasher condensed into 30 odd minutes . The second story Hair is anything but predictable , this is one bizarre idea & is by far the most effective of the three stories as long as you can suspend your disbelief long enough . God knows who came up with the idea for this segment but they sure have one hell of an imagination . The third story Eye is also predictable as it's just a clichéd body part taking over type scenario & most disappointingly of all I guessed the ending within two minutes of Brent having the transplant . The script by Billy Brown & Dan Angel really could have done with stronger ideas & should have included twist ending for all three segments . Director's Carpenter & Hooper film with competence but the low TV budget & production values are hard to ignore . Carpenter seems to pay homage to himself as he sets The Gas Station in Haddonfield while the film is littered with genre personalities , from director's like Wes Craven , Sam Raimi & Roger Corman to actor's like Tom Arnold , David Naughton , George ' Buck ' Flower , Deborah Harry , Twiggy & John Agar besides those I've already name-checked . There is some gore here , various plucked out eyeballs rolling around & a graphic operation sequence when Brent has his new eye implanted , a silly autopsy scene , a slit throat , someone is crushed under a car with loads of blood gushing everywhere , a pair of hedge trimmers in someones eye & a cut arm . Technically Body Bags is pretty solid considering it's a TV produced film , nothing spectacular but at the same time it's generally well made . There is some decent stop motion animation in Hair while the other special effects are also OK . The acting was fine & there are plenty of familiar faces . Body Bags isn't the best horror anthology out there by any means but I've always liked this sub-genre so maybe I'm being a bit generous . Disappointing in some respects but still worth a watch if you've got nothing else to do .
498718	1355507	681784	6.0	" Gentlemen , you are about to enter the most important and fascinating sphere of police work the world of forensic medicine . " The first we got to hear those words .	Quincy M . E . : Fight City Hall . . . To the Death ! starts as LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) examines the dead body of Diane Johnson ( Martha Smith ) on a beach , LAPD cop Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) sees it as a open & shut case of rape & that Peter Gordon ( Rick Podell ) who was shot by some of his men while in possession of Diane's handbag is guilty . Quincy is positive Peter isn't though , trying to use scientific methods to convince Monahan fails & he decides to investigate Diane's murder himself . He starts at city hall where Diane worked but before long more dead bodies turn up & Quincy feels the answer lies in city hall itself with corrupt counsellors . . . Episode 1 from season 1 this is where it all started for Quincy , this is where we got our first glimpse of the much loved Los Angeles coroner & I have to say I didn't actually like this one that much . I first have to say I will be basing my comment on the cut down 45 minute version rather than the longer original one which is available in the DVD set , it seems the short one only gets played on TV to bring it & the other feature length episode down to the standard 45 minute duration . I must admit that if I had seen this back in ' 76 I probably wouldn't have bothered sticking with the show because this is one of the weaker murder mystery episodes . I found the way Monahan constantly dismissed Quincy's findings as stupid , sure if Quincy was going on a hunch I could understand it but Quincy presented solid medical facts especially regarding the guy who supposedly hanged himself & he would have been obliged to accept Quincy's findings . Then there's the fact Quincy , at least in this short version , isn't in the lab at all in this episode & flies off to Mexico to do some investigating & it just felt like a routine cop show rather than the interesting mystery show Quincy would become . The character's are nothing special , there's some humour here but not much & overall while it's still watchable I didn't think it ranked up there with the best Quincy stories . This one looks OK , I'm not sure about some of the fashions but it was made in ' 76 which was before I was even born . In a way it's amazing to think episodes of Quincy are still being played even now . The end features some truly awful dubbing & some of the grunt noises Quincy comes out with are pretty funny because they so obviously are dubbed , badly dubbed too . This is the episode which features the two cars falling over a cliff seen in the opening titles for the rest of the show's entire run . The acting is good & Klugman just fits into the role perfectly from the word go . Go Fight City Hall . . . To the Death ! is an OK Quincy episode , it's probably more notable for being the very first one rather than for being a particularly good story . A must if your a fan otherwise there are better stories out there .

Episode 1 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is far from the best season opener but is an entertaining way to kick off the fifth season of Quincy all the same . While No Way to Treat a Flower is a moralistic episode focusing on the social issue surrounding drugs , the taking of unknown chemicals & the inadequacies surrounding the advertising of said chemicals & drugs there's some nice little sub plots including a race against time to save Kathy's boyfriend Scott & yet more examples of bureaucracy & red tape as Quincy tries to do something about the problem but finds himself hitting a brick wall at almost every turn . There's some really nice humour here too , during season four is when the production team & actors really ' got ' the character's & everyone is like a family now , the dialogue is often funny yet still has a message , everyones quirks & personalities shine through & if your a fan of the series the interaction between the character's is joy to watch during this period of the show before the writers watered Quincy down , married him off , made him sell his boat , etc . Also if there is anyone out there who thinks every Quincy episode ends on a happy note then watch No Way to Treat a Flower since it has a poignant , sombre & fairly downbeat ending & is one of many Quincy's which blows the myth that there's a murder every episode out of the water . Klugman puts in a powerhouse performance here , the guy is just a wonderful actor . Here he show's real emotion ranging from anger , frustration , sorrow , exasperation , happiness , grumpiness & the whole lot played perfectly . The scenes where he comes up against red tape & the drug magazine publisher are just great . He was born to play Quincy & I can't imagine anyone else in the role ( see the awful Has Anybody Here Seen Quincy ? ( 1977 ) from season two for proof of that & how ordinary the show is without Klugman ) . Veteran Hollywood & TV actor Whit Bissell has a small role in this as a botanist . No Way to Treat a Flower is a good Quincy episode , it has a strong well written story , some nice humour & a fantastic performance by Klugman although that in itself is nothing new . Well worth a watch .
498546	1355507	366555	6.0	Better than I was expecting . . .	The Hazing , or Dead Scared as I think it was commonly released under , starts with crazy Professor Kapps ( Brad Dourif ) murdering one of his students in some sort of occult ceremony . . . Delia Rodgers ( Nectar Rose ) , Marsha Glaser ( Tiffany Shepis ) , Tim Fields ( Parry Shen ) , Doug Leary ( Phillip Andrew ) & Roy Moore ( Jeremy Maxwell ) all want to join a sorority house but they have to go through ' the hazing ' in which challenges are set that they have to achieve . The first part of the hazing is to collect specific items including a book called the ' Saviour of Souls ' from Professor Kapps house , Marsha & Doug are on the case . They break into Kapps house & discover that he is a homicidal maniac , he ends up dead after a struggle & they take the book . The next part of the hazing is stay a night in the ' Hack House ' , an old empty house where a couple of murders were committed . The friends meet up & settle down for the night but little do they know that Kapps soul has the power to possess & kill , with the supernatural power in the Saviour of Souls book he hopes to become immortal . . . Written & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought The Hazing was an OK teen slasher , I've seen better but I've seen worse . The script never takes itself too seriously which helps & there's some nice light humour here . The character's are slightly better than usual as well , most of them are at least likable & the fact that they are given specific costumes gives them a little bit more personality & identity . The basic story is a bit of a mess & the set-up never really convinces , I can understand why Professor Kapps would need to kill to activate the spell but why carry on randomly killing people ? There is simply no need whatsoever , if he was immortal & could possess anyone he wanted why would he decide to use his powers to just kill ? Wouldn't he possess someone like Bill Gates the richest man on Earth & just live it up ? I know damn well sure I would ! I mean it would make more sense wouldn't it . Anyway , the other aspect of The Hazing I was disappointed with was the body count & exploitation elements , I have to say that The Hazing was far too tame for my tastes . There's some nice boobs on show but there weren't enough kills & as a whole the first hour of the film felt very slow as a result . However if your looking for a half decent modern slasher than The Hazing is a decent watch . Director Kanefsky does a really good job & The Hazing is a surprisingly stylish & good looking film . The cast are all very good looking & since I'm a bloke I will specifically point out the babes here who are really rather nice looking . There's a fun atmosphere & it's not really scary . As a whole it's pretty tame , there's some splattered blood , a decapitation , an axe in someone's head , someone is shot , someone bites their huge tongue off & that's just about it I'm afraid , pretty low on the gore meter . There is a scene in which a blonde bird is assaulted by a long demon tongue but even that feels strangely soft & has little impact . Technically The Hazing is pretty impressive , it looks the part & is much better than the usual low budget shot on a digital camcorder type crap us horror fans have had to suffer over the past few years . The acting wasn't too bad & I quite liked everyone in it , Nectar Rose ( ! ) in particular is hot in her bunny outfit . . . The Hazing was better than I expected but at the same time I wasn't expecting much so that still doesn't make it any sort of masterpiece as far as I'm concerned . It's worth a watch , sure it is but just don't expect too much .
496864	1355507	105527	6.0	" I'd rather face the truth than wallow in deception . " Slow but moving tale of a Vampire !	Tale of a Vampire starts with immortal Vampire Alex ( Julian Sands ) reminiscing about the way things used to be , about his one true love Virginia ( Suzanna Hamilton ) who he lost many years ago . Alex then picks a cat up & drinks it's blood . . . Alex is currently writing a thesis on religious marters , those burned at the stake for their beliefs & that sort of thing . Alex regularly frequents a library full of the reference & old manuscripts he needs but the library only has one employee at the moment Denise ( Marion Diamond ) so she plans to advertise for an assistant when Anne ( Suzanna Hamilton again ) walks in & offers her services despite the job not being formally advertised yet , seeing it as a stroke of luck Denise gives Anne the job . Alex instantly recognises the resemblance Anne has to Virginia & starts to get close to her , taking her to dinner , walking her home & having strange cryptic conversations with her . Anne knows something isn't right about Alex & her fears are seemingly confirmed when a man named Edgar ( Kenneth Cranham ) suddenly shows up & explains to Anne that Alex is a Vampire & that he must be destroyed . . . This English production was written & directed by Shimako Sato & I saw some nice ideas & elements in here that were ultimately lost amongst the sedate pacing . The script really is about as threadbare as one could imagine , the whole first forty minutes of Tale of a Vampire is nothing more than Anne getting the job at the library & meeting Alex , that's it . Alex is a bit of a dull Vampire , all he does everyday is sit in a library reading books which in the end has no real relevance to the story & pine over Virginia . On the positive side Tale of the Vampire is a quite emotive film & I ended up feeling for the character's , I started to feel somewhat sorry for everyone involved & a little sad for Alex at the downbeat climax . The story of Virginia unfolds through flashbacks that Alex has so that subplot punctuates the slowness of the main story at times . Tale of a Vampire is a different sort of Vampire film , it's very story & character driven , there's no big action or horror scenes even though it is gory on occasion & it's not very traditional in the sense that Alex never grows fangs , he's not afraid of the daylight & he doesn't sleep in a coffin . There are only two or three main character's in Tale of a Vampire & the dialogue is kept to an absolute minimum which may be a problem for some as it definitely doesn't help the pace of the film . Japanese director Sato has created a visually stylish film , because of the minimal dialogue & story Tale of a Vampire relies heavily on it's imagery . The cinematography & lighting are both great & Tale of a Vampire is a nice looking film with some cool shots , lighting & angles . Having said that where did that kid who falls from the sky with a sword stuck in him come from ? Anyone whose seen it will know the scene I'm talking about , I couldn't work out what was supposed to have happened in that scene . Set in London the dark back alleys make for a grimy setting & give the film a nice familiar & modern but sinister & creepy atmosphere throughout although there aren't many libraries like that in London , if any . There is some nice gore , most of it involves fountains of blood pouring from wounds , someone has their throat slit , people are stabbed with swords & old piping , cats are mutilated & someone has their head bashed against a wall which results in gallons of blood spurting everywhere . Technically Tale of a Vampire is top notch considering the budget it must have had , the photography , production design , special effects & music are all impressive & it's generally well made throughout . The acting was OK , I liked Sands as Alex , the way he looks & his subdued lonely performance worked well . Hamilton as Anne didn't do much for me but she was alright . Tale of a Vampire isn't a film for everyone , it's a challenging piece of film-making . Sure it's just about as slow as a film can be but the way it's filmed & put together I found it watchable & I actually cared for those on screen for a change .
497983	1355507	745533	7.0	Unusual , but great , episode .	Werewolf : The Wolf Who Thought He Was a Man starts with Eric Cord ( John J . York ) hiking on a mountain road & meeting a German man named Hugo who picks him up , Hugo claims to be a keen hunter & is the owner of the Owl Mountain Lodge . Hugo offers Eric a job as a handyman which Eric accepts . At night Hugo entertains Eric with stories about hunting & the old days , Hugo also seems very interested in Wolves . Then four guests turn up at the lodge & one is brutally killed shortly after by what appears to be a Wolf of some sort . . . Episode six from the first & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during August 1987 , directed by David Hemmings I actually rather liked this installment which is markedly different than the previous five . I must admit I wasn't expecting the twist in this episode , the fact that Hugo respects the Wolf as a hunter so much that he wants to be one going to the extent of running around at night dressed in a Wolfskin hunting his guest's at the lodge is quite a novel idea & the exposition at the start between himself & Eric sets his character & motivations up really well . Then of course Hugo finds out that Eric is a real Werewolf & he puts an end to Hugo's murderous ways during a slightly rushed climax , in fact that's the main problem with The Wolf Who Thought He Was a Man as it's just too short to really develop a surprisingly strong concept & story . Obviously the twenty five made for telly limitation is the main problem but at the same time at least it moves along at a good pace & is never boring but here the character's do suffer a bit especially the lodge guest's who are given next to no screen time . The Wolf Who Thought He Was a Man is also the very first episode of Werewolf not to feature either Skorzeny or bounty hunter Rogan . Although it has little to do with the actual episode I have to say I really liked the clever title too , I like the way the title refers to a Wolf thinking he was a man rather than the more literal explanation for the episode a man thinking he was a Wolf . All very meaningful & deep I'm sure ! You can tell that the makers weren't allowed to show much gore , the opportunity to show a mangled corpse is not taken although there's a shot of a decapitated head in a bag . The Werewolf make-up effects are as usual very good . After the rather lacklustre looking Spectre of the Wolf here the series goes back to a creepy horror film atmosphere with some well shot scenes , the inside of Hugo's shed with it's knives , stuffed animal heads , various bones & skull's with shaft's of moonlight coming in through cracks in the wooden walls is very evocative & just has a good horror film atmosphere about it . The Wolf Who Thought He Was a Man is a good stand alone episode of Werewolf , with none of the regular character's featuring apart from Eric this is one you could easily watch on it's own in isolation & it has nice glossy production values which help .
499008	1355507	745524	7.0	Good Werewolf episode with an abrupt ending .	Werewolf : King of the Road starts as drifter Eric Cord ( John J . York ) jumps on a goods train just outside Portland that is headed towards Kansas City . When aboard Eric discovers that he is not the only stowaway on the train hitching a free ride as he meets a group of homeless bums trying to get as far away from Portland as possible after six of their homeless bum friends had been brutally murdered . Later that night while the men sleep someone slits the throat of another & Eric is blamed being the new boy but he manages to convince the other's that he didn't do it & a impromptu murder trial is set up with Eric as the judge , as the evidence is heard & examined Eric realises that the case has more to do with him & his Werewolf curse than it first seemed . . . Episode twenty three from the one & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during February 1988 , directed by Richard Colla this is a fine episode with a very good story that is slightly let down by a very abrupt ending which rounds things off in unsatisfactory fashion . I must say I really liked the setting here the old rickety train as it rolls along at night & I also really liked the murder mystery story in which a group of homeless men hold a trial to discover who slit the throat of one of their number with Eric as the judge & the dovetailing of his Werewolf curse with the mystery as it unfolds . So up to a certain point King of the Road is actually a nice taught murder mystery that eventually turns into an out & out horror but one couldn't help but feel the ending was rather rushed , we don't even get to see the supposed Werewolf on Werewolf fight as the programme just cuts away as they start to fight & never returns . I liked the story & the twists , I liked the character's & I liked the setting but the ending is a bit of a downer . King of the Road is the second episode of Werewolf which is set around train tracks coming after Blood on the Tracks ( 1987 ) in which Eric was a railroad worker . As usual there are one or two nice Werewolf transformation special effects scenes but no real blood or gore apart from a dead body or two . Like a lot of this series there's a great atmosphere in King of the Road with a really well lit set with plenty of shadows & patches illuminated by flickering fire , this looks very nice indeed just like the majority of this series . Veteran actor Sid Haig who is probably better known as the star of Rob Zombie's two films House of 1000 Corpse ( 2003 ) & The Devil's Rejects ( 2005 ) as captain Spalding makes a guest appearance here . King of the Road is for twenty odd minutes a great Werewolf episode that has some nice atmosphere , twists & character's but I can't help feel the rushed ending lets it down somewhat .
499007	1355507	745516	7.0	Werewolf goes Dawn of the Dead !	Werewolf : A Material Girl starts as teenage drifter Eric Cord ( John J . York ) gets a definite lead on his Werewolf nemesis Skorzeny who has been killing homeless teenagers . Eric manages to catch up with a Werewolf killing two homeless teens & chases it into a nearby shopping mall , trying to shoot & kill Skorzeny with his silver bullets Eric quickly runs out of ammo but is determined not to let Skorzeny escape & miss the opportunity to break the Werewolf curse . At the mall while searching for Skorzeny Eric meets a homeless teenage girl named Michelle ( Lisanne Falk ) who claims to have met Skorzeny . With just one silver bullet left & the vicious Skorzeny on the loose can Eric end the curse once & for all ? Episode twenty four from the one & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during Februrary 1988 ( the IMDb is wrong , how could it have aired back in October 1987 ? ) , directed by James Darren & seemingly taking it's title from a Madonna song A Material Girl is another impressive episode from a generally very good show . I suppose the one thing that stands out about A Material Girl is that it's set largely in a huge shopping mall just like George A . Romero's classic zombie film Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) & the remake ( 2004 ) , it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the inspiration for A Material Girl came from Dawn of the Dead . Although not as rich in themes & allusions as Dawn of the Dead there's still some time for a little bit of social commentary & what shopping malls mean in society to various people . The episode is split into two really with the first half consisting of Eric chasing Skorzeny through a darkly lit & empty shopping mall where it's firmly in horror territory & the second half sees him meet up with Michelle when the episode becomes more of a character driven piece . The twist ending might surprise you but if your a regular watcher of the series & have seen the previous twenty three episodes of Werewolf then it might not be quite as surprising & despite Skorzeny being constantly mentioned he doesn't actually feature in this episode at all . As usual for this series A Material Girl is well shot with lots of atmosphere & nice cinematography . There's a couple of clichéd jump moments including a satisfying ' jack in the box ' scene , there are quite a few effective sequences set in a toy store where creepy child's toys that are seem eerily lit . There's a little in-joke here in this episode as Eric walks past an electronic cash register in a shop & the counter reads 6 . 66 ! No real gore in this one & this is one of the few episodes that Eric doesn't change into a Werewolf . A Material Girl is another very good episode of Werewolf that mixes good character's & a really good horror atmosphere although the fact that they are so short can be frustrating as the endings are usually rushed .
499226	1355507	65163	7.0	Enjoyable monster flick .	The Valley of Gwangi is set in Mexico ' Somewhere South of the Rio Grande . . . At the Turn of the Century ' where the Breckenridge Rodeo Wild West Show stops & perform their cowboy routines for the locals . The show is owned by T . J . Breckenridge ( Gila Golan ) & has hit upon hard times , it seems no-one wants to pay to see staged cowboy show's , I can't blame them really . Anyway , her ex-boyfriend & ex-partner Tuck Kirby ( James Franciscus ) working for rival show Buffalo Bill's wants to buy her out . Breckenridge isn't interested & show's Tuck her latest big star attraction , a miniature prehistoric ancestor of the modern day horse called an Eohippus . English paleontologist Professor Horace Bromley ( Laurence Naismith ) learns of the Eohippus & discovers it was found in the ' Forbidden Valley ' where all sorts of dinosaurs & prehistoric creatures roam including Gwangi an Allosaurus . . . Directed by Jim O'Connolly the idea for a film that mixed monsters & cowboys was originally conceived by stop motion animator Willis O'Brien in a story he called ' Valley of the Mist ' which he pitched as a sequel to King Kong ( 1933 ) but couldn't get it made , eventually O'Brien's protégé & probably the most famous stop motion animator ever Ray Harryhausen managed to use the concept here in The Valley of Gwangi . The script by William Bast ( IMDb lists Julian More with ' additional material ' ) is actually very similar to King Kong & the two films are very alike , the discovery of a land that time forgot where prehistoric monsters & dinosaurs roam , the superstitious locals , the capture of a wild & dangerous monster , people putting it on public display to make money & the obligatory ending where the creature escapes & goes on a destructive rampage through some sort of civilised location with hordes of locals running & screaming in panic , all you have to do is change the locations & change the giant ape of King Kong to a dinosaur here in The Valley of Gwangi . The story also bears more than a passing resemblance to The Beast of Hollow Mountain ( 1956 ) & takes a while to get going , it's a good fifty odd minutes before the dinosaurs appear although once they do it's monster sized fun & action all the way until the end credits . The character's are poor broad stereotypes , silly quaint cowboys , an annoying kid for comedy relief , the fragile woman who falls for the male hero & although the script tries to say something meaningful about the exploitation of animals & the pursuit of scientific knowledge it never really follows through on the ideas & themes it raises . But then again no-one is going to watch The Valley of Gwangi for it's moralistic , deep & meaningful story are they ? No , they will be watching it for the monsters & dinosaurs & on that score there is much to enjoy here . Harryhausen animates some truly superb set-pieces here from the capture of Gwangi to the fight between Gwangi & a Styracosaur to Tuck's fight with a Pterodactyl to Gwangi's rampage through the town to his fight with an Elephant ( that has a ridiculous sound effect accompanying it ) to the climatic fire inside a cathedral ( which considering it's made of stone burns very quickly ) . Since Gwangi & the other dinosaurs are animated by a real person as opposed to a computer they have real personality & the effects are generally excellent throughout . My only real problem is that there's nothing that memorable here , a dinosaur is a dinosaur & Gwangi doesn't hold up well against some of Harryhausen's other creations . Gwangi is meant to be an Allosaurus but he was actually modelled on a Tyranosaurus . Apparently the word Gwangi is native American & means lizard . Technically the film is very good , the special effects are the obvious highlight although the depiction of the wild west & cowboys in general is extremely dated . There are some animal cruelty issues here as well , there are a lot of horse falls here as well as a brief bull fight which both look like the animals safety was a secondary consideration . Set in Mexico the film was actually shot in Spain . The acting isn't great , it's all rather wooden & stiff with the rubber dinosaurs having much more life to them . The Valley of Gwangi is a treat for giant monster , dinosaur & Harryhausen lovers out there like myself , however the story really isn't that great & is pretty much King Kong with cowboys . Once it gets going in the second half then it's fantastic but I don't think the first half will last long in ones memory .
499395	1355507	91474	7.0	Solid serial killer thriller .	Manhunter starts with FBI agent Jack Crawford ( Dennis Farina ) trying to persuade friend & former psychological profiler Will Graham ( William Petersen ) to come out of retirement & help him catch a brutal serial killer known as ' The Tooth Fairy ' ( Tom Noonan ) who has slaughtered two entire families already . After a few psychological tricks & emotional blackmail Graham agrees , leaving his wife Molly ( Kim Greist ) & young son Kevin ( David Seaman ) behind Graham travels to Atlanta & the scene of the Leeds family murders . As Graham walks around the Leeds house he begins to get a feel for the killer & his motives but he still has little to go on except that both killings were committed on a full moon & the next one is fast approaching . He still needs help so Graham decides to visit notorious serial killer Dr . Hannibal Lecktor ( Brian Cox ) & ask for his help but doesn't get anything out of him . Then Lecktor's prison Doctor , Frederick Chilton ( Benjamin Hendrickson ) discovers a note in Lecktor's cell from the ' Tooth Fairy ' . Graham quickly figures out that Lecktor & the ' Tooth fairy ' have been communicating with each other by use of a secret code placed in a newspaper advert . Once the FBI have broke the code they find it tells the ' Tooth Fairy ' the location of Graham's wife & son , he becomes even more drawn into the case as he desperately tries to unmask the identity of the ' Tooth Fairy ' & save both his family & sanity . . . Written & directed by Michael Mann I thought Manhunter was a good film but not a brilliant one . The script by Mann based on the novel ' Red Dragon ' by Thomas Harris is slow burning & concentrates on characters rather than action . The bulk of Manhunter is made up of Graham's attempts to capture the ' Tooth Fairy ' rather than showing lots of killings , in fact only two people are actually killed on screen & you can guess who one of those are . Forget about seeing Hannibal Lecktor either , he gets a cameo which amounts to less than five minutes & that's it . Not much background is given to any character as Manhunter likes to deal with the here & now rather than the past , having said that the characters are well fleshed out & you care for them which is essential for a film such as this . Manhunter is a good film that has a gripping storyline , is basically well made & is quite absorbing but was a bit too slow for my tastes & thinking back to it now ( I just finished watching it an hour or so ago ) nothing sticks in my mind & not that much really happened when all said & done . Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any , a few gunshot wounds is your lot I'm afraid . The acting is one of Manhunter's strongest points with great performances all over the place from Cox as Lecktor to Petersen as Graham . Technically Manhunter felt bland & unremarkable except for a cool shot when the sun was setting producing a visually great looking backdrop for one scene . I'm not sure about the use of music & songs either , a couple of the songs in Manhunter seemed really out of place & actually annoyed me . So that's it I suppose , there's nothing really wrong with Manhunter as it tells a good solid story but at the same time didn't do anything spectacular or impress me that much . Definitely worth a watch but I much prefer The Silence of the Lambs ( 1991 ) to Manhunter in every regard .
498788	1355507	65491	7.0	A nasty little film .	The opening sequence is set in the middle of some forest somewhere , the local witch finder known as Albino ( Reggie Nalder ) lies in wait . They ambush a waggon full of nuns , they force it off the road and attack the passengers . We then cut to a town square , a large crowd of people have gathered to witness the torture and execution of the unfortunate people from the waggon . A man has his hand cut off and is coated in feathers , while two women are lowered alive into a huge fire , setting them alight . These are the brutal ways of Albino and his gang of witch hunters . As witchcraft has spiralled out of control Count Cumberland ( Herbert Lom ) and Count Christian Von Meruh ( Udo Kier ) are sent to the area to try and bring some order and check the local witch finders methods . The film thereafter is really just a collection of fairly brutal torture scenes , we see various accused have their thumbs crushed with thumb screws , branded , whipped , beaten , forced to sit on a chair of nails , their tongues ripped out , burned alive , beheaded and various other forms of torture , whats not to like ? ! These scenes are presented in a simple way , their there to shock . The film doesn't try to glamorize them , there brutal acts of torture and are presented that way . Directed by Micheal Armstrong , this is a pretty good horror film . The script certainly fleshes out the characters nicely , the Albino character is shown as a total monster , raping , torturing , making up false charges , murdering , and enjoying the benefits like power and money . Lord Cumberland is basically the same , however he justifies what he's doing in the name god , and seems to believe it . Christian is a young man , learning his trade from Cumberland , he falls for a falsely accused woman from the village , Vanessa ( a sexy Olivera Vuco ) . She manages to plant doubt in his mind about his and Cumberland's brutal ways . Corruption is also explored , and how various individuals could gain from having someone accused of witchcraft and basically murdered , technically within the law at the time . A nicely paced mix of brutal torture / action and plot / character development . The film also seems to have very good production values , great authentic looking period costumes and locations , the music's quite appropriate sounding too . Acting wise , Herbert Lom steals the show as Lord Cumberland . If you can make it through the torture , rape and sex then you should be rewarded with a good little film . I liked it .
498618	1355507	96098	7.0	Great little discussed thriller .	Shoot to Kill starts late one night in San Francisco as diamond merchant Mr . Berger ( Milton Selzer ) sets the alarm off in his jewellery shop & the police show up , still in his pyjama's with a couple of pounds of diamonds it's clear that he's being forced to act against his will & when questioned by special FBI agent Warren Stantin ( Sidney Poitier ) he admits that an armed man has his wife as a hostage . The local police & Stantin try to negotiate the release of Mrs . Berger ( Janet Rotblatt ) but the plan only ends up getting her killed & the killer escaping with the diamonds . The next day & the killer is trying to cross the border into Canada through a small town called Bishop Falls but is spooked when he sees a large police presence & decides to kill a member of a hiking group & take his place so he can cross the border on foot . Meanwhile Stantin learns of the man's death which was in the same unique manner Mrs . Berger was killed & sets off after his man through the tricky & rough mountainous terrain . . . Directed by Roger Spottiswoode & known under the better title of Deadly Pursuit here in the UK I thought this was a great action thriller which doesn't often get mentioned . The script by Harv Zimmel , Michael Burton & Daniel Petrie Jr . takes itself pretty seriously although there are one or two light hearted moments surrounding agent Stantin's ' fish out of water ' type situation even if the scene where he confronts a Grizzly Bear & scares it off by flapping his arms in the air is a little too silly . The film moves along at a nice pace & mixes the genres of thriller , action & whodunit very effectively . The character's are good & I liked the way that despite working together agent Stantin & his guide didn't suddenly become the best of friends & have long deep , meaningful conversations about their lives as in say Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) because that's just so clichéd . In fact there isn't that much dialogue spoken in the film & poor Kirstie Alley barely says a word ! Shoot to Kill starts off as a whodunit mystery but about half way through it reveals the killer & it changes in tone & becomes a taught thriller & I actually rather liked this abrupt & unexpected change in direction it took . A good solid throughly entertaining thriller with a decent cast that's worth a look but won't have much replay value as once you know the killer the films twist won't have any impact & the entire first half will lose it's effectiveness . Director Spottiswoode does a good job here , the isolated forest locations are well used & the film has a nice tension to it especially during it's first half when we don't know who the killer is . There are some good action scenes including chases , a car chase , some shoot outs & people hanging over cliffs on rope although when John hits that cliff face the force & impact would have broken just about every bone in his body . The violence & body count are relatively low as is the profanity but that makes a nice chance . Technically the film is fine with nice location shooting , it was shot largely in Canada with the opening sequence shot in San Fransico . It's well made & I would have imagined it had a decent budget coming from the Disney owned Touchstone Pictures . The acting is good & there's a pretty impressive cast here . Shoot to Kill , I much prefer the title Deadly Pursuit , is a neat little action thriller with a good concept that's not predictable has unusual relationships between the character's & is well worth a watch .

The only other surviving footage is a three second clip of two Daleks from Episode Seven which , lets face it , amounts to just about nothing .

Anyway , directed by Derek Martinus from a script by David Whitaker it's difficult to comment on one episode in isolation but I have to say I quite liked this & after seeing it I am slightly disappointed that I will in all probability never get to see the other six episodes . The story is quite good here , obviously it has a long way to go with a further five episodes & a lot can or indeed can't happen but it looked a good story & by all accounts it was / is . It moves along at a nice pace , it didn't seem to have any padding & I actually got quite into the action . I liked it , a shame I'll never get to see the rest of it . This story also features the debut of Victoria played by Deborah Watling who would go on to travel with the Doctor in TARDIS & become a regular companion until Fury From the Deep ( 1968 ) at the end of the following season . This one looks good with a large part of it being set in 1866 , the BBC even back then were damed good at period costume dramas ( certainly better than they ever have been at staging convincing sci-fi ) & the production design on this is pretty impressive . Was it just me or did the Daleks in this look really short ? I mean when one confronts Patrick Troughton who isn't exactly the tallest man ever himself it's actually shorter than Troughton is which just look a bit odd . There is also a very noticeable goof in this , when the Dalek puts Victoria on the scales after the close-up on her face if you look at the left hand side of the screen during the shot straight after you can see part of a TV camera move out of shot ! Probably the one that had just filmed the close-up on Victoria's face in fact . Evil of the Daleks : Episode 2 is a tantalising & frustrating glimpse into what seems like a good Dalek story ( contary to popular belief there aren't that many about . . . ) & I'm a tad disappointed I'll never be able to see the other six episodes . Oh well , I suppose in the grand scheme of life it doesn't matter that much . This can be found on the 3 disc Lost in Time Doctor Who DVD release & is a must for fans who have to see everything otherwise I doubt there's much point for more casual viewers .
497042	1355507	95863	7.0	" Small town's are like people , some grow old & die a natural death , some get murdered . " Enjoyable sequel , & a decent film in it's own right .	Phantasm II sees Mike ( James LeGros ) now residing in ' Morningside Psychiatric Clinic ' after his tales of the Tall Man ( Angus Scrimm ) & mutant midgets fail to explain & convince the authorities why his friend Reggie's ( Reggie Bannister ) house was blown to pieces during the opening sequence . After 7 long years & lots of lying to the Doctors Mike is set free & immediately heads for the nearest graveyard where he discovers that all the bodies have been dug up & stolen & the prime suspect is the Tall Man . Mike also meets back up with Reggie who then invites Mike back to his ( new ) house to meet his family , unfortunately as they approach Reggie's house explodes , again . Since Mike is a bit of a psychic he knows that the Tall Man was responsible so he teams up with Reggie to track him down & put an end to his corpse stealing , mutant slave midget creating & murdering ways . Oh , & they would probably like to stop him blowing anymore of Reggie's homes & family members up too . They eventually track him down to a small town in Oregon called Perigord where he is in the middle of wiping out the entire town , together with a hitchhiker named Alchemy ( Samantha Phillips ) & an attractive woman named Liz ( Paula Irvine ) who both feature heavily in Mike's psychic visions he sets out for a final showdown to the death . . . Written & directed by Don Coscarelli this , the second of four Phantasm films so far , is probably as good as the series gets . The script is fast paced ( not one but two house's are blown up within the first 15 minutes ) , never boring or dull & doesn't seem to treat itself too seriously which considering the overall silliness of it is a good thing . The character's aren't developed that much & are a little one-dimensional but they just about come across as likable enough for us to care about them . Phantasm II feels very 80's with everything done to excess , the car they drive around in , the over-the-top weapons they construct like the home made flamethrower & the double double barrelled ( or maybe that should be quadruple barrelled ) sawn off shotgun ( wouldn't the recoil alone break your arm ? ) , a chainsaw fight , lots more make-up effects than the original & , of course , the hairdo's . I'm not sure about the psychic stuff & if the Tall Man can make a house explode why can't he just , for example , make the car that Reggie & Mike are driving in explode ? I liked the idea that the Tall Man travels across America robbing small town's of the contents of their graveyard's & as a whole the film worked well & has a certain engaging narrative . Director Coscarelli piles on the atmosphere & manages to film some cool horror sequences , the death of Father Meyers ( Kenneth Tigar ) by the series trademark silver sphere is memorable as it slices his ear off then drills into his forehead & there is a creepy scene when a worm like creature emerges from someones back & starts to talk . The girls look nice & even nicer without their tops on as we get a fair amount of nudity , in terms of gore there is the aforementioned death of Father Meyers , a sphere impales someones hand forcing them to chop it off with an axe & one works itself into someone's back & semi exit through their mouth , people are burned alive , embalmed with acid , a rat is blown to pieces & some unlucky guy has a chainsaw shoved between his legs , ouch . Made for about $3 , 000 , 000 Phantasm II easily has the biggest budget of the series , technically it shows with a very well made solid film throughout with some neat special effects , nice cinematography , good music & better than expected production values . The acting is OK but then again look at what these people had to work with , on a side note apparently according to the IMDb's ' Trivia ' section Brad Pitt auditioned for the role of Mike . . . I liked Phantasm II , sure it's silly & ultimately isn't going to change anyone's life but it is entertaining & fun & as far as I'm concerned that's the only reasons I watch films , to have fun & be entertained . There are much worse ways to spend 90 odd minutes , definitely worth a watch .
497135	1355507	106220	7.0	" You'll meet someone , someone very special , someone who won't press charges . " Good sequel .	Addams Family Values starts with the news that Morticia ( Angelica Huston ) is about to give birth , she does & everyone including the Father Gomez ( Raul Julia ) are very excited .

Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld Addams Family Values is a worthy sequel to the original Addams Family ( 1991 ) & a good watch in it's own right . The script by Paul Rudnick takes the usual standard social situations & twisting them into a ghoulish gag , joke or set-piece & there's plenty here to smile at . While I didn't find any of it laugh out loud hilarious I found it consistently amusing , it runs for 90 odd minutes & it moves along at a nice pace , there's enough happening to keep one entertained for it's duration . All the usual character's are there & well represented , the dialogue is good & the story is also pretty good . Director Sonnenfeld does a good job , there's that fantastic morbid atmosphere running through the film & the Addams Gothic mansion looks the business . Technically the film is very well made & has great production design & it has that big budget Hollywood look about it . The acting was good & the cast bring the character's to life . Addams Family Values is a good film , it's pretty morbid when it wants to but it also has that dark comedic edge as well . What more can I say , it's well worth a watch .
497608	1355507	55304	7.0	" Am I not the spawn of his depraved blood ? " Impressive 60's Edgar Allan Poe adaptation from Roger Corman .	Pit and the Pendulum ( there is no ' The ' at the beginning of the on screen title ) starts in 1546 somewhere in Spain . Francis Barnard ( John Kerr ) has travelled from England to investigate his sister Elizabeth's ( Barbara Steele ) sudden death . Francis arrives at a large foreboding mist enshrouded castle that sits on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean & belongs to Elizabeth's husband , Nicholas Medina ( Vincent Price ) . Francis knocks the door and Maximillian ( Patrick Westwood ) the butler answers . Nicholas's sister Catherine Medina ( Luana Anders ) also turns up and invites Francis in . Nicholas tells Francis that Elizabeth died unexpectedly three months ago from a condition of the blood . Francis is unimpressed by Nicholas's explanations and feels he is not being told the truth . The only other person in the castle at this point is the maid , Maria ( Lynette Bernay ) . At dinner that night Dr . Charles Leon ( Antony Carbone ) turns up . His side of events differ from Nicolas's . Leon claims that Elizabeth died from sheer fright as she became obsessed with a torture chamber situated in the bowls of the castle that belonged to Sebastian Medina ( Vincent Price , again ) , Nicolas's Father who was one of the most cruel and feared members of the Spanish Inquisition . Catherine's body has been resting in the Medina's families tomb for months but the distraught Nicholas fears that Catherine may have been buried alive , like his Mother . Strange occurrences start to happen , whispering voices & unexplained incidents that suggest Nicholas may be right and somehow Catherine has returned for revenge ! As the night draws on the sinister goings-on are revealed as a thunder storm rages outside , but can anyone survive the ultimate terror of the Pit and the Pendulum ! ? Produced and directed by Roger Corman I was pretty impressed with this adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe novel of the same name . Pit and the Pendulum was the second of Corman's Poe adaptations coming after the House of Usher ( 1960 ) & before Premature Burial ( 1962 ) . The script by Richard Matheson effectively mixes haunted house horror & psychological terror with a satisfying twist ending . An ending that may not come quite as much of a surprise these days but is still very good all the same . I also loved the final ' poetic justice ' shot . There aren't many characters in the film but the ones there count . The acting is good all round but I did think Price went over the top a little at certain points , although one could argue that this was deliberate and was intended to be relevant to the twist ending . Having said that I wouldn't want any other actor but Price in the role . Forget about blood or gore as there isn't any , but don't let this put you off as a horror film doesn't have to be gory or violent to be good . One thing about Pit and the Pendulum that really stands out is the overall production design , sets , costumes and lighting . The film has a wonderful Gothic look throughout . The castle's cobweb strewn torture chamber , or it's gloomy flickering candle lit rooms and corridors with it's stonework walls . The solid antique looking furniture and props . The whole film is lavish and really looks the part , the evocative sets create half of the wonderful atmosphere on their own . Quite amazing considering that the budget was apparently only $200 , 000 which probably wasn't a lot even back in 1961 . Generally speaking the film is also well made throughout and at just under 80 minutes it never drags and is consistently both interesting & entertaining . On the negative side I'm not too sure I would watch it again now I know the twist ending and when all said and done not a great deal actually happens . But it's still a great character and plot driven Gothic horror / thriller from the early 60's that stands up very well even today & should be seen by all fans of the genre , so what are you waiting for ? Watch it !
497038	1355507	67229	7.0	" I knew I should never have picked up that broad . " Surprisingly good little exploitation film from the 70's .	I Drink Your Blood starts late one night in some woods just outside the small American town of Valley Hills where the self proclaimed first born son of Satan Horace Bones ( Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury as Bhaskar ) & his gang of hippie Satanists are holding a ritual as a local girl named Sylvia Banner ( Iris Brooks ) looks on , she is discovered , caught & beaten up . Sylvia manages to stumble back to town & ' Mildred's Bakery ' run by ( surprise ) Mildred Nash ( Elizabeth Marner-Brooks ) , Sylvia is taken home to her Grandfather ( Richard Bowler ) who eventually manages to extract the truth from her . He decides to confront Horace & his gang who are now squatting in the now abandoned hotel , taking LSD , performing more Satanic rituals & generally behaving in an antisocial manner . They beat him up , give him LSD & send him home with his young Grandson Pete ( Riley Mills ) . Pete is upset at the treatment of his Grandfather & as luck would have it a dog with rabies turns up which Pete shoots dead , extracts some of it's blood & infects some meat pies in the local bakery which the hippies buy the next day . In no time at all most of the hippies have gone psycho & are killing each other & anyone else they come across , it's up to the final few residents of Valley Hills & some construction workers lead by Mildred's boyfriend Roger ( Jack Damon as John Damon ) to save the day & stop the disease from spreading any further . . . Written & directed by David Durston I thought I Drink Your Blood was better than I had expected , I will be commenting on the uncut 83 minute version released on DVD & billed after the end credits as a ' Director's Cut ' although I'm not sure as to how this version differs from any other . The script is a bit slow at times but generally it moves along at a nice pace & at least it's not boring . I Drink Your Blood is exploitation motivated for sure , there's rape , torture , hard drug usage , animal cruelty , nudity , Satanic rituals & as much murder & mayhem as the filmmakers could fit into 83 minutes . Maybe not as shocking or extreme when viewed today compared to when it was originally made over 35 years ago it still has a nice nasty streak running through it . My only real complaint with I Drink Your Blood is between the exploitation moments I found it a bit dull & not much fun to watch as it seems to take itself quite seriously with slightly stiff & somewhat boring dialogue & character's , I just wish it was a bit more fun if that's the right word . On the negative side as well I found it somewhat silly that these crazed rabid psycho's are scared of water to the extent that they are unable to even step in a shallow stream or resist a hose pipe , also if your an animal lover you may want to avoid I Drink Your Blood as director Durston seems to stick some dead animals or animal cruelty in the film at regular intervals , a chicken has it's throat slit , a dog is shot dead , rats are caught killed & cooked , a dead rabbit is beaten against a tree & for some unexplained reason a dead goat with a cut throat is dragged around during the climax with some nice close ups just so we don't miss it . Director Durston manages to create that essential unique 70's grimy , sleazy atmosphere that almost makes you feel dirty for just watching it . He handles everything very well & injects some pace & energy into the film . There is a pleasing amount of gore as well , beside the animal cruelty someone's feet are cut open , a leg is chopped off , someone is stabbed , a hand is cut off with an electric carving knife , someone stabs themselves in the stomach with a wooden stake , someone is impaled with a sword that ends up coming out of their mouth , someone is gorily stabbed in the stomach & someone is decapitated . Probably made on a shoestring budget I Drink Your Blood is technically a very accomplished film & much better made than I had expected , the production values are good , the photography is surprisingly fluid & not static , the music is OK & it is competently made throughout at some nice locations . The acting is also pretty good although I have a problem with Mills as Pete the young boy , he is very annoying as most leading children are in horror films . I Drink Your Blood was an unexpected surprise for me , it has the gore & exploitation elements that I was hoping for but it has a definite polish & exceeded my admittedly low expectation's . I personally think I Drink Your Blood is an absolute must for exploitation fans & most horror fans will probably also enjoy it on some level , well worth a watch for those with the tolerance for these type's of films .
498839	1355507	408236	7.0	Entertaining adaptation of the musical .	Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street starts as wrongly convicted escaped penal colony prisoner Benjamin Barker ( Johnny Depp ) arrives back home in London 15 years after he was imprisoned at the behest of the corrupt Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ) leaving behind a beautiful wife & a young daughter named Johanna for the lecherous old Judge to prey on . Barker heads back to where he used to live & finds Mrs . Lovett ( Helena Bonham Carter ) running a meat pie shop , she claims his wife committed suicide & the Judge now keeps Johanna ( Jayne Wisener ) imprisoned in his house . Changing his name from Barker to Sweeney Todd to hide his real identity he sets up a barber's above the meat pie shop where he plots his gruesome revenge . . . This British American co-production was directed by Tim Burton & is a gory Gothic & darkly morbid film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical as opposed to a straight adaptation of the infamous story which has been around since the 19th Century , apparently . The musical adaptation was by Christopher Bond while the films screenplay is credited to John Logan , I will admit right here & now that I haven't seen Sondheim's musical this is based on so I have no idea if it's faithful but by all accounts there are several songs missing from this & it goes without saying that this film version has far more flexibility in what it shows than a live stage musical ever could . I liked the story , I liked the setting , I liked the character's & for the most part I liked the songs too but I did think the first half was a little slow at times . It's fair to say right now a few weeks after Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opened it has reached # 189 in the IMDb's ' Top 250 ' films list although I doubt very much that it will stay there especially when it comes out on home video . This is a hard film to call & recommend , apart from some isolated sequences with dialogue the entire film is sang & that in itself may put many off , it can look a bit strange at times & I must admit that I did start & get a little bored with it as the entire first half of the film is song after song with very little incident . Once the killings & gore start the films picks up immeasurably but that's probably down to the fact that I love horror films & gory horror films at that so one could argue that my liking for such things carried me through . If you don't like musicals where everyone bursts into song every few seconds & you don't like blood drenched darkly Gothic horror films then Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is your worst nightmare come true . This really is down to personal taste , if you have no interest in musicals or gore then give it a miss since I think it's a very acquired taste . Director Burton knows how to turn in a visually interesting & stylish film with Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street no exception , there's some wonderful camera shots & plenty of little visual gags & clever touches . It's certainly a great & often ghoulish film to sit down & watch . The sets are superb , they really give you a feel of the run down rat infested back streets of Victorian ( modern ? ! ) London & are totally convincing . Large parts of the film are gore free but once the blood flows there's plenty on show with some of the coolest slit throats out there , huge spurts of crimson red blood look great as do the various minced up bodies & mutilated human remains seen at the end of the film . Talking of the end it's all rather morbid & downbeat , personally I thought it was an appropriate & fitting way to round the film off but just don't expect a Grease ( 1978 ) style happy ending ! Over here in the UK the trailers that have run on TV have all been dialogue based & make no indication that Sweeney Todd : The Barber of Fleet Street is 95 % musical , I could certainly see people mislead by the trailers into thinking they were going to see a Tim Burton Gothic horror gore-fest rather than a sprightly musical which I think is rather naughty . . . With a supposed budget of about $50 , 000 , 000 Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is superbly made with exquisite production values , the sets look gorgeous although Burton tends to bleach a lot of the colour out of the shot & at times it's not far from being black and white . Actually shot here in the UK this certainly looks very nice . The acting is alright , the singing is alright & I have no major problems with either although I doubt anyone will be singing any of the songs on show here to themselves on the way home & the heavy cockney accents might put some off . Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an acquired taste for sure , I'm positive it won't stay in the IMDb Top 250 for very long & I don't really think it deserves to be there now . This one really is down to personal tastes , bear in mind that it's a musical & that it's quite bloody & if it still appeals to you then your more than likely going to enjoy it .
497418	1355507	681794	7.0	The cut down 45 minutes version .	Quincy M . E . : Hot Ice , Cold Hearts starts in Mexico city where thieves Alex ( Andrew Prine ) & Lisa ( Marianna Hill ) break into the national museum & steal $4 million worth of diamond jewellery . Cut to Catalina where LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his woman Lee ( Lynette Mettey ) are planning to enjoy the Independence Day 4th July celebrations on his boat , unfortunately it's not long before Quincy is called into action when a man named Juan ( Ron Hasson ) is taken seriously ill & later dies under mysterious circumstances . Quincy thinks he has been poisoned by a Stonefish but all the local marine experts say there are no Stonefish in Catalina , after several more suspicious incidents Quincy believes Juan was murdered but no-one will take his claims seriously . . . Episode 4 from season 1 this Quincy story was directed by Bruce Kessler & is more classic Quincy that should please fans of the show . I should say that Hot Ice , Cold Hearts was originally a feature length episode but was edited down at some point to make it run the same time as the episodes when Quincy became a regular series & it's this shorter 45 minute version that I will be basing my comments on although the version readily available on DVD is the longer one , it's all very confusing . . . The script on this one has a decent enough mystery behind it & develops the Quincy character as someone who can't let go & always fights for the truth , the diamond heist theme is pretty good as well . This one moves along at a fast pace & at times this shorter version seems to take huge strides forward in a very short space of time & I would image thats down to the editing out of 30 odd minutes of footage . I prefer it when Quincy is in the lab rather than on a holiday & I must admit I don't like his female friend Lee either , I just find her annoying & superficial . She feels almost like a token woman just because there has to be one in the cast . This one hasn't dated too badly , it still looks OK but isn't going to win any awards for style . It's well made enough on location . The acting is alright & it was nice to see Stuart Whitman turn up as a Sheriff . Hot Ice , Cold Hearts is a solid classic early episode of Quincy , if you don't like the show they you won't like this but if your a fan then it's a must see .
498720	1355507	610961	7.0	" We are all interested in the future for that is where you & I are going to spend the rest of our lives . " Affectionate look at the life & career of Edward D . Wood Jr .	The Incredibly Strange Film Show : Ed Wood , or ' The Son of The Incredibly Strange . . . ' as it's on screen title says , is a 40 odd minute documentary focusing on the life , the career & the death of the infamous Edward D . Wood Jr . . Originally aired here in the UK during 1989 this was episode 1 from season 2 of the short lived TV series The Incredibly Strange Film Show that looked at a variety of oddball filmmakers . This particular episode focuses on the so-called worst director of all time Ed Wood , to be honest I can't see why he merits so much attention or notoriety as his films are simply terrible & being branded as the worst director of all time is nothing to be proud of but each to their own I suppose . As well looking at his films including Glen or Glenda ( 1953 ) , The Bride of the Monster ( 1955 ) & Plan 9 From Outer Space ( 1959 ) it delves into his personal life revealing he was a transvestite & that he died on his own , homeless & penniless in Hollywood . There are filmed interviews with his ex-wife who says he never saw a penny from any of his films , Vampira who appeared in Plan 9 , Paul Marco who also appeared in several of his films & leading lady from Night of the Ghouls ( 1959 ) Valda Hansen which are both affectionate , candid & sometimes sad like Marco's recollections of Bela Lugosi injecting himself with drugs to satisfy his addiction . Overall this is a good solid informative , entertaining & heartfelt documentary that is a must for Ed Wood fans . Shot in Hollywood this , like other Incredibly Strange Film Show episodes , visits some relevant locations & interviews quite a few people who are no longer with us so this documentary couldn't be made today . In fact unlike the rest of the episodes in The Incredibly Strange Film Show's two season stint this is the only one where the main focus of the documentary was dead at the time it was made & could therefore be considered a retrospective piece . There is one hilarious anecdote when someone says that the flying saucers from Plan 9 look like metal pie dishes but has subsequently discovered that the films budget didn't stretch to metal pie dishes & they were actually two paper plates stuck together ! There is also some awful looking footage from the Plan 9 From Outer Space musical which looks absolutely terrible . This is another great show from this great series & series producer & host Jonathan Ross clearly loves the genre , if your a fan of strange films & exploitation cinema then this is a must . It's also a must for Ed Wood fans , if such things exist . This is a notoriously hard series to track down , only illegal bootleg DVD-R's & domestic off-air recordings made at the time it was originally broadcast are currently available which is a shame .
499391	1355507	610972	7.0	Two Incredibly Strange Film Show's in one !	The Incredibly Strange Film Show : Tsui Hark & Stuart Gordon , or ' Son of the Incredibly Strange . . . ' to give it it's full title , is a 40 odd minute documentary that for the first 20 minutes focuses on the weird world of Chinese Hong Kong cinema & in particular writer , actor & director Tsui Hark . Once the commercial break is over ( when it was originally broadcast here in the UK anyway ) the show switches to Los Angeles & Hollywood to focus on director Stuart Gordon & in particular his classic splatter film the rather fabulous Re-Animator ( 1985 ) . Originally aired during 1989 here in the UK on Channel 4 this was episode 4 from season 2 of the criminally short lived The Incredibly Strange Film Show presented by a young looking Jonathan Ross who has gone on to become one of the UK's biggest celebrities . The first half of this episode is about the Chinese film industry , although Ross interviews Hark the show covers a broad range of Hong Kong fantasy cinema . Personally I'm not a big fan of Asian cinema & therefore I found this part pretty dull , sure there are the usual nice interviews with various people , plenty of clips ( none of which made me want to watch any of the films presented & in fact put me off Asian fantasy films even more ) & nice location reporting form Hong Kong itself but I'm just not that interested in the subject matter . It's also odd to hear Hark say he has no intention of defecting to Hollywood to make films almost 10 years before he actually did & made the two Jean-Claude Van Damme flicks Double Team ( 1997 ) & Knock Off ( 1998 ) . The show improves from my point of view dramatically as the second half concentrates on Stuart Gordon & his splatter flick Re-Animator , this part was far more interesting & since I'm a huge Re-Animator fan this is just great stuff . The questions Ross puts to him are relevant & Gordon's answers are clear , concise & he doesn't stray off topic . Another great episode from a great series . Again this is actually shot on location in Hong Kong for the Tsui Hark part & Hollywood for the Stuart Gordon interview . While in Hollywood Ross also visits the set of Bride of Re-Animator ( 1990 ) which was being filmed at the time he was there , interviews with director Brian Yuzna & star Jeffrey Combs are forthcoming . There are some nice behind-the-scenes stuff on the set & Ross also interviews special make-up effects man John Carl Beuchler & there is a quick glimpse of some of his effects in his workshop including the Jason Voorhees mask from Friday the 13th Part VII : The New Blood ( 1988 ) & he makes a mechanical Troll from Troll ( 1984 ) sing during the end credits . Another visually interesting & well put together documentary . This is a great documentary , if your a fan of both Chinese fantasy films & Stuart Gordon then you'll be happy as a pig in sit . While not a big fan of the Hong Kong stuff the Stuart Gordon Re-Animator interview more than makes up for it . This is a very rare series that has never been released on VHS or DVD , apart from illegal bootleg copies taken from off-air recording of the original broadcasts . If you can find a copy & you like cult films then this , as is the whole 12 episodes over it's 2 seasons , is a must .
497209	1355507	871197	7.0	" " I don't know about soul's , I'm a lawyer . " Another decent Masers of Horror episode .	Masters of Horror : Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby ( Julia Anderson ) & Ciff Addison ( Martin Donovan ) are driving home , however while talking Cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road . Cliff's airbag works OK & he walks away with minor injuries , unfortunately for Abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body . Abby's life is saved , just . She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns . Cliff decides that she should die , his selfish lawyer Ira ( Corbin Bersen ) thinks they should let Abby die , sue the car manufacturer & get rich while Abby's mum Pam ( Linda Sorenson ) wants to blame Cliff , get rich & save Abby . However Abby has other plans of her own . . . This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt ( whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn ( 2003 ) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode ) & was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series , while I didn't think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution ( 2006 ) . The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I'd say it's a bit uneven , the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abby's life & the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart . The character's are a bit clichéd , the weak man , the bent lawyer , the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough , the dialogue is OK , the story moves along at a nice pace & overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit & I wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending . Director Schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes , this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore . There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual , there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross ( images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser ( 1987 ) & it's sequels ) , then there's the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box ! Very messy . There are also various assorted body parts . There's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked . . . Technically Right to Die is excellent , the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of Horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is . The acting was fine but there's no big ' names ' in this one . Right to Die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene ! Well worth a watch . . . for those with the stomach .
498683	1355507	120902	7.0	" The impossible scenario we never come up with a plan for ? Well , we'd better come up with a plan . "	The X Files starts in ' North Texas 35 , 000 B . C . ' which at that point in time looks more like the Artic . Two primitive cavemen ( Craig Davis & Carrick O'Quinn ) find shelter from the harsh elements inside a cave . They also find an alien creature that kills one of them before the other caveman stabs it to death , however the aliens spilt blood seems to be alive . . . Jump forward to ' North Texas Present Day ' where a young boy named Stevie ( Lucas Black ) falls into the cave that has lied undisturbed for 1000's of years , it's not long before he is infected with the alien blood . Soon after a group of sinister men in suits arrive to clean up . . . The X Files are now closed & both FBI agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) & Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are assigned to more mundane tasks like dealing with terrorist threats in Dallas where Mulder discovers a bomb which ends up detonating & destroying a building , causing $45 , 000 , 000 in damage & killing five people . Someone has to take the blame & Mulder & Scully are it , however a Dr . Alvin Kurtzweil ( Martin Landau ) contacts Mulder & says that the explosion was in fact planned by his own people to dispose of three bodies infected with the alien virus . Mulder decides to investigate Kurtzweil's claims & discovers aliens , conspiracy's , cover ups , shadowy figures & a sinister plan that could wipe out the entire human race . . . Directed by Rob Bowman the only , thus far , big screen outing for Mulder & Scully is a pretty good film , I have seen most of the TV series although not since they were first aired here in the UK probably over 10 years ago now so it is hard for me to compare the two . The script by Chris Carter works well , the basic story is good although I have to say any fan of the series may find it somewhat linear & predictable . The film also has a big climax in which it starts to resemble Aliens ( 1986 ) . I think I'm right in saying that the alien blood featured in this film is also present in some of the TV episodes so I guess it doesn't really take things in any new direction . I also thought that it went on for too long , I personally like short films as my interest begins to wain easily & I must admit I did start to look at the clock to see how long was left . I would have preferred if the story had more of a mystery element , we the viewer know what's happening & we have to wait for Mulder to catch up , as it were . Director Bowman , a veteran of the series , does nothing spectacular . There are a few nice wide aerial shots of deserts , snow covered landscapes but for the most part it looks like the TV series . There are a few aliens in it , a fairly tame autopsy & a few splashes of blood but nothing too graphic . With a budget of about $66 , 000 , 000 all I have to say is where did the money go ? That's a hell of a lot of money for a mostly character driven film with two big CGI effects ( a building blowing up & a huge spacecraft at the end ) & no major stars . It's well made & has that Hollywood polish to it but that is a lot of money considering what ended up on screen , to my eyes anyway . The acting is OK but it's not like Duchovny or Anderson haven't had practise in the roles , is it ? The X Files is a good film with a entertaining sci-fi type plot , fans would probably be disappointed as I don't think it's a radical departure form the TV series but , as I said , I think it's a solid film . Definitely worth a watch especially for sci-fi fans .
497695	1355507	120912	7.0	" Your attracted , she's not even my species & I'm attracted . " Fun if somewhat familiar sequel .	Men in Black II starts one dark New York City night , an intergalactic spacecraft crashes in Central Park , an alien life-form named Serleena emerges & takes the form of a underwear model ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) , Serleena is looking for the powerful Light of Zarthar & heads straight for two-headed alien Charlie ( Johnny Knoxville ) who tipped her off about the Light being on Earth . Eventually the trail leads to an alien named Ben ( Jack Kehler ) who runs a pizza place who Serleena kills as witnessed by shop assistant Laura Vasquez ( Rosario Dawson ) who then comes into contact with the Men in Black as Agent Kay ( Will Smith ) & Agent Tee ( Patrick Warburton ) are sent to investigate . When it becomes clear that Serleena is after the Light of Zarthar the MIB boss Zed ( Rip Torn ) says only one person knows about the Light , Agent Kay ( Tommy Lee Jones ) who has been neutralised . Agent Jay must convince Agent Kay to come out of retirement , help regain his memory , stop Serleena & save the planet Earth ! Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who also has a small cameo role , I thought Men in Black II was pretty good if undemanding fun & personally that's all I really think it sets out to achieve . The script by Robert Gordon & Barry Fanaro based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring with some huge special effects sequence not too far away . From flying cars & spacecraft chasing each other over Times Square & a spacecraft travelling through space destroying every planet as it goes to huge alien worms half eating a New York subway train & a variety of bizarre aliens . The humour is still here but somehow doesn't seem as funny this time around as Men in Black II as a whole is very similar to the original Men in Black ( 1997 ) , I often smiled but I never flat out laughed . The character's are still very likable but basically the same as the original with Laura becoming Agent Jay's love interest & the sexy Serleena the obligatory villain dressed in black leather , hey it works for me ! One thing that Men in Black II lacks is a decent interesting story for it's character's , everything that happens in the film seems to be there purely to show off an effect , in fact Men in Black II could be described as one overblown & silly special effect after another with very little regard to what takes place between . While on the subject of the special effects I must admit that I wasn't that impressed with some of them , Will Smith riding Jeff the huge alien worm at the start look fake as does Creepy ( Michael Baily Smith ) the O-Zone stealing large headed flying saucer riding trio of duplicate aliens , the two headed alien played by Johnny Knoxville is both highly irritating , has probably the poorest effects & strangely just disappears two thirds through the film never to be seen again ! Considering Men in Black II wasn't made that long ago I'd say the special effects are actually quite poor . With a massive estimated budget of $140 , 000 , 000 & at less than 90 minutes long it's difficult to see where all that money went , unless it was on Smith's salary . It definitely has that big budget Hollywood look & polish about it although nothing really impressed or stood out that much . The acting is OK & both Smith & Jones work well together as mismatched MIB partners . Dawson as Laura is hardly in it while the same can be said for both Knoxville & Flynn Boyle as the villains which is a shame as Boyle makes for a good baddie , in leather . I have given Men in Black II as I was entertained , had fun watching it & as a mindless way to pass 90 odd minutes it's great but as a proper emotive , thought provoking film with a moral or a message then it falls well short of the mark . I think it's well worth a watch as long as your expectations aren't too high & are just able to have fun with it .
498820	1355507	805420	7.0	" You are so full of sht your eyes are brown . " Decent Masters of Horror episode .	Masters of Horror : Valerie on the Stairs starts as wannabe author Rob Hainsey ( Tyron Leitso ) pitches up outside Highberger House , a place for unpublished authors to stay & write . Rob is welcomed by the owner Nancy Bloom ( Nicola Lipman ) & is given a small room from which he can work in peace , however things turn creepy very quickly . At first there is constant loud knocking on Ray's door but when he answers it no-one is to be seen anywhere until he finally sees a young woman named Valerie ( Clare Grant ) sitting on the top of a flight of stairs but as Ray approaches her she disappears into the shadows & behind a brick wall . After several more encounters with the mysterious Valerie Ray becomes convinced that she is a ghost , however things aren't quite that simple . . . This Canadian American co-production was episode 8 from season 2 of Masters of Horror , written & directed by Mick Garris who is also the shows permanent executive producer I quite liked Valerie on the Stairs although it's not the best episode I've seen . The script was apparently based on a short story by Clive Barker ( why hasn't he made a Masters of Horror episode yet & while I'm thinking about it where's David Cronenberg's entry ? ) & starts out as a fairly effective ghost story but turns into something else completely by the end , in typical Barker style it turns into a story about twisted imagination , demons & torture . I have to mention the strange ending which literally comes from nowhere , I have to say I really liked it although I have to admit I didn't really understand it or what it represented but what the hell it just looked cool & felt right somehow . At less than an hour it moves along at a great pace so becoming bored shouldn't be a problem & it manages to sustain it's stories change in direction pretty well . On the negative said the ending felt rushed & the demon guy dies too easily . Director Garris does a good job & there's a nice bleak atmosphere running through Valerie on the Stairs , there's not much colour to it & Garris like to place his camera at the foot of narrow stairs looking up or at the end of a long cramped corridor which gives a nice claustrophobic feel . As a a whole this episode of Masters of Horror reminds of the film I , Madman ( 1989 ) which has a similar theme & basic idea . There's some nice gore as usual , someone has their spine ripped out through their mouth , someone has their breasts slashed open with a fountain of spurting blood the result & someone has a chunk bitten out of their neck . The special effects are top notch as always & the demon guy looks impressive . Techncially it's well made with good production values & to it's credit it doesn't look like a cheap TV show . The acting is pretty good , the ' name ' actor in this episode is Christopher Lloyd who puts in a good shift , Tony Todd also makes a appearance under layers of latex so you may not recognise him straight away . Valerie on the Stairs is a decent Masters of Horror episode , it's not the best one I've seen but it's far from the worst . I reckon it's worth a watch but I think most self respecting horror fans will anyway regardless of what anyone says .
496897	1355507	308541	7.0	A behind-the-scenes look at the special effects of Evil Dead II .	The Making of ' Evil Dead II ' or The Gore the Merrier is a short 30 odd minute documentary that was produced by Anchor Bay for their DVD release . The documentary almost entirely focuses on the special make-up effects , it features retrospective interviews with effects team Robert Kurtzman , Howard Berger & Gregory Nicotero who filmed all the camcorder behind-the-scenes footage featured . As you would expect they discuss the effects in a fairly obvious way in the sense of ' we moulded a fake head for that bit ' or ' he had a full latex body suit on ' sort of thing . What really makes this documentary invaluable for Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) fans is the candid on set footage shot by Nicotero , everyone seems very natural & like their having lots of fun . Sam Raimi , Bruce Campbell & various other cast & crew members are present in this raw footage but don't appear as interviewees which is a little disappointing as the documentary is very one dimensional & you wish other areas were discussed , nothings perfect I suppose . There are a few brief camcorder shots of scenes that didn't make it into the final cut of the film including the chopped up body of Ed ( Richard Domeier ) & the puppet with half of his head sliced off along with a scene where the possessed Ash eats a squirrel & one where the possessed head of Linda ( Denise Bixler ) in the vice vomits green slime over Ash . They talk about some of the effects & scenes that didn't go as planned . The documentary finishes of with a spoof of Re-Animator ( 1985 ) called Evil Dead Baby filmed by the effects crew in their spare time , probably . For what it is this is a great insight into the effects of Evil Dead II but I felt it was far too shallow & I would have liked to have seen a bit more participation from other members of the crew . This is essential for Evil Dead II fans but even they may be a little disappointed by how limited it actually is . Having said that it's still definitely worth watching especially since it's a free extra on a DVD .
497104	1355507	359013	7.0	" Pants down ? They pretty much fcking ass raped us . " Enjoyable third Blade film but not as good as the previous two . . .	Blade : Trinity starts in the Syrian Desert where the Vampire race have discovered the ancient resting place of Drake ( Dominic Purcell ) , or rather the original Vampire commonly known as Dracula . Meanwhile Blade ( Wesley Snipes ) is wanted by the FBI after his Vampire hunting exploits & using Whistler ( Kris Kristofferson ) they find Blade & capture him , Blade is saved from both the FBI & the Vampires by Hannibal King ( Ryan Reynolds ) & Whistler's daughter Abigail ( Jessica Biel ) who are part of a new , young breed of Vampire hunters who call themselves Nightstalkers . With Whistler gone & Dracula the most powerful Vampire ever resurrected Blade joins forces with the Nightstalkers to develop a virus which will hopefully wipe out the Vampire menace from Earth once & for all . . . Written & directed by David S . Goyer Blade : Trinity was the third & to date final film to feature the Vampire hunting Marvel comic book character Blade , while not as good as either the original Blade ( 1998 ) & the sequel Blade II ( 2002 ) this is a fine film in it's own right but it was always going to be hard to follow two class acts & as such Blade : Trinty suffers from not being as good as it's predecessors rather than just being a bad film which in my opinion it isn't . Annoyingly this is yet another film which was released theatrically & then released as a ' director's cut ' on DVD soon after which restores about ten minutes of cut footage although there's no extra gore despite being ' Unrated ' . Like the previous Blade films Goyer was on script duties & he introduces the character of Dracula , unfortunately this is one of the films weaker aspects as he is relegated to a bit part & leaves little impression with the delicious Parker Posey as Danica Talos the most memorable & interesting villain although frustratingly she isn't in it that much either . Also one has to say the story is a little simplistic & maybe isn't as involving as it should have been & the introduction of the new Nightstalker character's feels a bit forced & like the film is deliberately trying to start a franchise going that doesn't include Blade . On the positive side , of which there are many , Blade : Trinity looks fabulous , at almost two hours it doesn't feel like it & it moves along like a rocket , there are some good ideas here like the human blood bank set up by the Vampires as they literally farm the homeless for their blood , there are loads of fights , cool weaponry , good solid dialogue with some amusing one-liners & a bit of light hearted comedy as the script throws in a Vampire poodle ! Blade : Trinity is a film for lads , it provides bags of violence , good looking girls & plenty of slick action that barely lets you catch your breath . Director Goyer does a great job here & the film as a whole is so stylish it's a joy to watch , from slow motion to some cool camera angles & a stylish flashback sequence Blade : Trinity just looks fabulous . He also packs the film with wall to wall action , from a spectacular opening sequence where Blade blows a Vampire factory up & an ensuing car chase where there's a cool highly detailed slow motion shot of a car crashing into a post to dozens of brilliantly choreographed martial arts fights to shoots out & the use of all sorts of cool looking chrome plated weaponry like swords , guns , triple barrelled shotguns , bows & arrows , knives & throwing blades ( wouldn't they attract more attention walking through a street in broad daylight tooled up with bows & arrows , swords & some serious guns ? ) . The whole film looks incredibly cool & stylish with much to enjoy . I was a bit disappointed with the gore levels , there's nothing in Blade : Trinity that compares with the exploding Vampires from the original or the scene in Blade II when the Vampire hunter has half his head sliced off , there just aren't any really big crowd pleasing moments of gore that I both expected & hoped for . There's a brief decapitation & some blood splatter but very little else . With a supposed budget of $65 , 000 , 000 & opening with very lukewarm reviews & disappointing box-office returns Blade : Trinity certainly has that Hollywood gloss about it , it looks great , it sounds amazing & has coolly stylised production design that gives it a wonderful graphic novel sort of look . Shot in Vancouver , British Columbia in Canada . The acting is alright with everyone posing in very cool & stylistic ways as they kick ass , was it just me or did Wesley Snipes look a lot older in this compared to the first two films ? The wrestler Triple H makes an appearance , Jessica Biel is cute but it's Parker Posey as the sexy sadist Vampire with an attitude who steals the show & is as memorable as anything else in the film . Blade : Trinity is not as good as the previous two sterling efforts but don't let that put you off since it's a throughly entertaining , action packed & stylish action horror film in it's own right . Well worth a watch . Followed by the made-for-TV series Blade : The Series ( 2006 ) which wasn't too bad but got cancelled after only 12 episodes .
496827	1355507	288477	7.0	Decent haunted ship horror film .	Ghost Ship starts as Artic weather patrol pilot Jack Ferriman ( Desmond Harrington ) approaches Captain Sean Murphy ( Gabriel Byrne ) & his crew of professional salvager's , Jack says that while flying his route over a remote part of the Bering sea he spotted a huge seemingly abandoned ship & that if they cut him in on the salvage money he'll show them where it is . Murphy & his crew agree & they set sail , they find the boat which happens to a huge Italian cruise liner called the Antonia Graza which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 without trace . As salvage the Antonio Graza is worth a fortune so they quickly set about getting back to dock , however in an accident their own boat is blown to pieces so they are stuck on the Antonia Graza . To make matters worse it has a huge hole in it & will sink within a few days , then there's the strange ghostly goings on which become ever more unpleasant & deadly as the truth behind the ship's dark past is revealed . . . This American Australian co-production was directed by Steve Beck for the then newly formed Dark Castle Entertainment production company , Ghost Ship was the third film from Dark Castle following the two remake's House on Haunted Hill ( 1999 ) & Thir13en Ghosts ( 2001 ) both of which were perfectly entertaining films , Ghost Ship was the first of their films to be based on an original idea although I use the word original rather lightly . Anyway , the script here by Mark Hanlon & John Pogue is reasonable fun & makes for a decent enough haunted ship chiller . It moves along at a nice pace although by the end of the film I was becoming bored of seeing people randomly walk around dark corridors , luckily to balance these scenes things always seem to happen to them at some point so all the walking around to pad the running time out does have it's pay-off which is nice . The character's are a touch one dimensional but no ones going to watch a film called Ghost Ship & expect anything deep or meaningful , are they ? I must admit I quite liked the satisfying twist ending ( s ) & I didn't see it coming either , I also liked the back-story given to the ghost ship with the haunted & cursed gold & the events of it's dark past . So what we have in a nutshell is a decent teen horror with some gory moments , a fair amount of bad language some gratuitous nudity & a run time that doesn't outstay it's welcome , I liked it because it entertained me & it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Beck OK , the film is nice enough to look at & there are a few stylish scenes especially the niftily edited fun flashback when the original passengers were killed . This film is not a remake of or has any connection to either The Ghost Ship ( 1943 ) or Ghost Ship ( 1952 ) & in fact has more in common with Death Ship ( 1981 ) although they are still two very different films . There's some gore here although after the initial showstopper gore filled scene at the start it becomes surprisingly tame , expect for that totally cool opening massacre there's a slit throat , some gory gunshot wounds , someone is literally mashed to pieces between to huge cogs & someone swings when they get a crane hook stuck under their chin . With a supposed budget of about $35 , 000 , 000 this had a decent budget but when compared to the $100 , 000 , 000 plus budgets of the biggest Hollywood productions it pales into comparison , it's well made which is alright but it can feel a bit too ' staged ' at times if you know what I mean . The CGI effects are good , the make-up effects are as well & it has good production values . The acting is serviceable , most of the bland cast members put in forgettable if adequate performances . The only actor with any class here is Byrne who does OK . Ghost Ship is an enjoyable big budget popcorn special effects laden horror which provides both a fair amount of undemanding fun & entertainment , well that's my opinion anyway & I'm sticking to it !
498128	1355507	462499	8.0	Loved it , one of the best lads action films in a long time with a body count to rival World War II .	Rambo starts in the river village of Mae Sot in Thailand where John Rambo ( Sylvester Stallone ) earns a meagre living as a boatman , he is approached by Michael Burnett ( Paul Schulze ) who works for a pan Asian ministry church & is trying to lead a small team of volunteers up river North & into Burma to deliver medical aid & relief for those caught up in Burma's sixty year civil war . Reluctantly Rambo agrees , takes the team into Burma & than heads back . While in Burma helping people in a small village called Klaw Kbe Lo it is attacked by the Burmese military with many brutally killed & some taken prisoner . Word gets back to Rambo who then helps a small band of hired mercenaries to get the survivors back , lots & lots of people start to die . . . This American German co-production was co-written , produced & directed by Rambo himself Sylvester Stallone & one has to say I loved just about every gory minute of it . The fourth Rambo film I must confess that out of the previous three I have only seen Rambo III ( 1988 ) which I also loved & this one lives up to my high expectations . The script by Stallone & Art Monterastelli stays true to the Rambo character in these politically correct & sensitive times , I love the fact Rambo by todays standards is a dinosaur as he doesn't believe in negotiation , he doesn't believe aid workers can make a difference & he thinks to beat the bad guy's you have to blow them all to pieces ! A simple yet undeniably effective philosophy . Of course the script also paints the opposite opinion with the aid workers trying to help & frowning on any sort of killing but luckily for the audience Rambo's point-of-view wins out in the end & we are treated to some spectacularly gory & action packed set-pieces which I thought were tremendously fun & entertaining . The basic plot is pretty much the same as any action film , the good guy has to stop the bad guy's give or take a few minor differences like settings & motivation . Here the bad guy's are very bad as they kill women , children & babies , they rape , torture , execute & abuse the innocent in some very graphic sequences so it's even more sweet when Rambo turns the table on them & dispenses a bit of bloody retribution . At just over 75 minutes ( the closing credits last near 10 minutes ) the film moves along like a rocket , there's more than enough bloody violent action to keep most action junkies more than satisfied & the story is based around something that is actually taking place right now as I write this , the civil war in Burma which gives it a certain uneasy credibility although I'm not saying for one second Rambo is realistic in any way other than where it's set . Director Stallone does a fine job here , he makes the nice looking locations work very well & he doesn't disappoint when it comes to the action . Rambo has to be one of the most violent & bloody films ever to go into mainstream theatres , people literally explode in a shower of blood & limbs , arms are chopped off with machetes , women , children & babies are graphically killed , people are hanged , someone has both his legs blown off while someone else has his legs beneath his knees eaten by ravenous pigs , there's rape , there's loads of blood as head are literally blown off , the backs of peoples heads explode everywhere , limbs are blown & cut off & the scene at the end when Rambo climbs aboard the jeep with the huge gun on the back & lets rip is just one of the single greatest scenes ever in any film . Watch as all the bad guy's explode everywhere ! If that isn't enough Rambo also rips someones throat out , beheads someone with a machete & guts someone with a huge knife , all in a days work I suppose ! According to the IMDb this has a kill count of 236 which averages at 2 . 59 killings a minute . There are also plenty of explosions & action as well . All of the action scenes are well shot occasionally with a shaky camera but it's always clear what is going on which is a factor many filmmakers seem to ignore these days . With a supposed budget of about $50 , 000 , 000 Rambo is well made with high production values . Rambo is apparently banned in Myanmar , formally Burma , by the military Government which says something ! Actually filmed in Thailand the locations look very nice . The acting is alright , Stallone was never the greatest actor anyway but he does fine here & plays Rambo with a nice bitter cynicism , although he does look a bit old at times it never bothered me as he still looks in pretty good shape . Rambo is not a film for everyone , it's incredibly violent & some of the stuff the Burmese military get up to may distress but in reality war doesn't care about race , creed , religion , sex or age & I believe that Rambo merely tells it , OK more like graphically show's it like it is . If you like your action films violent then Rambo is the film for you , if not then it isn't . Maybe the best film I've seen in 2008 so far .
497069	1355507	77945	8.0	I liked it .	Bond girl Ursula Andress plays Susan Stevenson who travels to New Guinea with her brother Arthur Weisser ( Antonio Marsina ) to look for her husband , Professor Henry Stevenson ( Tom Felleghy , uncredited ) who has disappeared in the jungle and hasn't been heard from for weeks . They persuade a Professor named Edward Foster ( Stacy Keach ) to guide them into the jungle and help them look for the lost man . On their adventures they come across a guy named Manolo ( Claudio Cassinelli ) who decides to travel with them as they are all banished from Father Moses ( Franco Fantasia ) peaceful village he has set up with some of the local natives , lots of animal cruelty and the odd cannibal , however the cannibals don't really make an appearance until the final third of the film . But it turns out they could each be there for very different rather selfish reasons than first hinted at . Co-written and directed by Sergino Martino I rather liked this , nice authentic jungle locations that create good atmosphere , shot quite well too , with really nice colourful widescreen photography by Giancarlo Ferrando ) . The script by Martino and Cesare Frugoni moves along at a pretty good pace , it certainly keeps the story moving along nicely and tries to add the odd twist here and there , whether it succeeds will probably depend on how many of these types of films you've seen before . The effects are pretty good too , there's some fairly impressive gore , rotten bodies , intestine eating , spearing , decapitations , someone is attacked and eaten by an Alligator and at the end Andress is stripped and has her dead husbands rotting flesh smeared all over her body , nice . Like most of the other Italian made cannibal films Mountain of the Cannibal God contains a fair amount of real animal cruelty , including various animals fighting and eating each other in unnecessary detail , a lizard is skinned and gutted , some snakes are torn to pieces and a tarantula is chopped in half by a machete so be warned ! There are also pleasing amounts of nudity as well . Overall the film is very well made and seems to have good production values courtesy of Massimo Antonello Geleng . The down side would be the rather slow pace at a couple of points here and there , and if your an animal lover forget it !
498223	1355507	74285	8.0	One of the best Stephen King adaptations around .	Carrie starts in a girls locker room ( which , in my opinion as a bloke , is a good place to start ) where the girls are getting changed & Carrie White ( Sissy Spacek ) is having a shower . As she soaps herself down she begins to bleed , she is having her first menstrual period but thinks she is bleeding to death as she knows nothing about what is happening to her because her strict fanatical religious mother Margaret ( Piper Laurie ) hasn't told her about the facts of life . The rest of the girls taunt & tease her , throwing tampons at her & laughing , the gym teacher Miss Collins ( Betty Buckley ) comes to Carrie's rescue . The Bates High School prom is fast approaching & the nasty mean Chris Hargensen ( Nancy Allen ) is barred from going , she blames Carrie & together with her boyfriend Billy Nolan ( John Travolta ) plans to gain a cruel revenge . Meanwhile Sue Snell ( Amy Irving ) feels sorry for Carrie & tells her boyfriend Tommy Ross ( William Katt ) to ask Carrie to the prom , he agrees & Carrie accepts despite strong protests from her loony mum . At the prom things go well to start with but Carrie is humiliated in front of the entire school by Chris , in a rage of anger Carrie uses her powers of telekinesis , the ability to move or change objects through the power of the mind , to gain some sweet revenge of her own . . . Directed by Brian De Palma Carrie is a good horror film . The script by Lawrence D . Cohen is based on the 1974 novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I cannot compare them , in fact Carrie was King's very first novel & in turn became the first to be adapted into a film . Carrie is all about character's , feelings & it tries to say something meaningful , it's not an easy film to pigeonhole as it could be described as a horror , thriller , drama or fantasy with strong elements from all . Every emotion in the book is here , sadness , sorrow , pity , anger , hate , happiness , jealousy , fear & it even touches upon the taboo subject of child abuse . The film does a brilliant job at portraying these emotions so that you really care & feel for these people which makes what happens so much more meaningful . There is an ' Ugly Ducking ' vibe to it as Carrie starts off shy , unhappy & suffers plenty of growing pains before she transforms into something different at the prom . Carrie is pretty slow going for the majority of it's 100 odd minute duration but this is essential as things build up superbly towards the climax where the horror really kicks in . I don't usually like slow character driven films but Carrie worked for me & I enjoyed it but don't expect a happy ending as Carrie is most definitely not a feel good film . Director De Palma does a first class job here , the character's are brilliantly drawn & developed . He gives the film some style with a few really cool memorable shots like the dizzying spinning camera scene when it revolves around Carrie & Tommy for what seems like ages , the split screen effect at the climax where we see Carrie's anger as she dishes out some revenge & , of course , that opening shower scene . . . Forget about any violence or gore as that's not what Carrie is all about , just a few stabbings . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 800 , 000 Carrie is well made throughout , good special effects , some nice stunts , good music & solid production values throughout . The acting is simply superb from everyone involved , Spacek is absolutely brilliant here & was rightly nominated for a best actress Oscar in ' 77 & Laurie was nominated for best supporting actress although neither won ( I have no idea who did that year but they must have been good ) . A young John Travolta does well . Carrie is a classic piece of horror that has impact & is quite a powerful watch , it's well made & stands up well even today although the slightly slow pace & lack of gory action may put some off . I'm sure you can get this cheap on DVD these days & it probably turns up on TV all the time too so there's no excuse not have seen , or see sometime in the near future , Carrie . Definitely worth watching .
497658	1355507	92147	8.0	A good , solid and enjoyable mix of comedy and horror .

Nah , I didn't think so . " Later on in the night he also asks a different waitress " what time do you get off ? " she replies " 2 . 30 " Duncan then says " can I watch ! ? " When AJ doesn't reappear from backstage Keith becomes suspicious and starts asking questions . As the night draws on Keith realizes this is no ordinary strip club and as his night continues to go from bad to worse will he live to see the morning and save his friends ? Written and directed by Richard Wenk I liked this and thought it was good fun . The way Wenk films the night scenes is highly stylized , he uses a pink and green neon lighting effect . For instance there is a scene when Keith is walking in an abandoned sewer system , as he walks down a tunnel one side of it is bathed completely in pink and the other side in green , almost all of the exterior night shots are lit this way , it looks quite cool if a little unusual . The special make up effects by Greg Cannom are for the most part impressive , we get a ripped out heart , bitten necks , slit wrists , death by high heeled shoe , a melting face and decaying vampires . Surprisingly , considering it's set in a strip club there isn't a lot of nudity , hardly any in fact . The acting was fine even if Chris Makepeace makes for a slightly dull leading man on occasions , Dedee Pfeiffer makes for a very sexy heroine , and best of all Grace Jones didn't say a single word throughout the entire film which is just the way it should be . The script is a little slow to get going , it takes over half an hour for the horror elements to kick in , but when it does it's great fun . Although Duncan as the comedy relief didn't always work and became annoying on occasions , and why when their running around in Los Angeles is there no one else anywhere ? Not one single person , or car . Overall I liked it , you could certainly do a lot worse . Recommended for some fun .
498572	1355507	78474	8.0	" You could always stay here & get turned into a Goldfish . . . " Classic monster film , they don't make ' em like this anymore .	Warlords of Atlantis starts deep in outer-space as the credits play over a large ball of flaming Martian rock as it hurtles towards a prehistoric Earth & ends up in the Sea . . . The film then switches to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean during the Victorian period . A boat named the ' Texas Rose ' slowly sails along , on-board is a rich Professor ( Donald Bisset ) & his son Charles Aitken ( Peter Gilmore ) who hope to find the legendary lost underwater city of Atlantis using American Greg Collinson's ( Doug McClure ) specially designed diving-bell . Captain Daniels ( Shane Rimmer ) warns the Professor about these waters , waters where boats have been known to just vanish but no one is interested & they carry on regardless . Both Charles & Greg dive deep under the Ocean's surface & encounter an aquatic dinosaur that tries to eat them , they also discover a solid gold ancient relic which the crew above manage to get aboard . Unfortunately for them a giant Octopus attacks the Texas Rose & the crew , Grogan ( Hal Galili ) , Fenn ( John Ratzenberger ) , Jacko ( Derry Power ) & the Captain are taken while the young deckhand Sandy ( Ashley Knight ) is left behind with the now wounded Professor . I'm not quite sure how but everyone ends up in a huge underwater bubble which houses the world of Atlantis & it's various cities . They are welcomed by a guy in a silver sequin dress named Atmir ( Micheal Gothard ) who takes them to the 3rd city of Troy , Charles is deemed clever so is separated from the group & taken to meet the supreme council who appear to be lead by Atraxon ( Daniel Massey ) & Astril ( Cyd Charisse ) while the others are condemned to a life of slavery & thrown into the dungeon's . Being a slave for the rest of his life is an idea which Greg isn't too keen on so with the help of a rather good looking female slave named Delphine ( Lea Brodie ) who luckily for any male viewers wears a skimpy cleavage revealing dress & some of the local wildlife they decide to make a break for it , but will they be able to rescue Charles & make it back to the diving-bell before they are either eaten by some monster or killed by the Atlanteans ? Directed by Kevin Connor this was the fourth & final ' lost world ' film he & star Doug McClure made together , the first being The Land that Time Forgot ( 1974 ) , the second was At the Earth's Core ( 1976 ) , after that came The People that Time Forgot ( 1977 ) & Warlords of Atlantis rounded of the loose series of films which is probably my favourite overall . The highly entertaining script by Brian Hayles moves along like a rocket & is never neither dull or boring which always helps & it also manages to combine the swashbuckling adventure , fantasy & Sci-Fi elements that make these types of films so much fun to good effect throughout . It never takes itself too seriously with references to the Mary Celeste coming to mind & the bizarre notion that the Atlanteans are in fact Martians . There are a few plots holes & slightly underdeveloped ideas but hey , nothings perfect right ? The characters are likable & the treacherous crew sub plot worked well , I was a little surprised about the end as Doug strangely didn't get the girl this time . Like the previous Connor films the monsters aren't exactly the pinnacle of realism , in fact most people would probably describe them as poor but I'd rather have the charm & personality of a man in a rubber monster suit than a cold lifeless fake looking computer graphic any day of the week . Along with the giant Octopus , flying prehistoric Piranha fish , dinosaurs & large Eels I especially liked the giant Millipede / fish creature that rises out of the water a couple of times , great stuff . I was impressed with the production design credited to Elliot Scott & the sets in particular , some of the Atlantis cityscapes were obviously just flat matte paintings but they looked good overall , from the dungeons to the higher cities which have a palatial feel to them & as a whole Warlords of Atlantis is quite a handsome film to watch . Forgetting about some of the less than spectacular special effects on a technical level Warlords of Atlantis is solid throughout , the acting is OK & I personally think the hot Lea Brodie as the love interest Delphine is easily the most attractive out of the four films & makes for the best heroine , the photography is nice enough & it has an all round decent polish about it . I really liked Warlords of Atlantis , much like Connor's other monster films this is terrific fun if your in the right mood & can forgive the generally dodgy special effects & as we all know good special effects don't necessarily guarantee a good film so surely the opposite is true as well , right ? Well it is in this case , great entertainment for all the family & well worth watching .
498291	1355507	1065293	8.0	Another fabulous Doctor Who DVD documentary .	Are Friends Electric ? is a 38 minute long documentary featured on the special edition DVD of the Doctor Who story Robot ( 1975 ) & a fine documentary it is as well . To start off with the documentary focuses on the change of Doctors between Jon Pertwee who left the role in the previous story Planet of Spiders ( 1974 ) at the end of the previous season & Tom Baker who took over the role in Robot . Various people are interviewed including producer Barry Letts , script editor Terrence Dicks & Tom Baker himself as they describe his getting the role from their own perspective . At this point Letts also mentions a few other actors who were in line to become the fourth Doctor & I have to admit I had never heard of any of them . After 20 odd minutes discussing Tom Baker's casting the documentary changes gear & focuses on the making of his first story Robot , again there's plenty of information & interviews with the cast including the guy who actually played the Robot & Christopher Barry the guy who directed the story . There are also some scenes from the Doctor Who museum in Blackpool where I presume the Robot suit has been kept as there are shots of it as it is today . There are enough clips , photos , anecdote's & personal insight to satisfy the most rabid of Doctor Who fans like myself & Are Friends Electric ? is one of my favourite DVD documentary's featured on the Doctor Who DVD range which is generally excellent & the only full price DVD's I bother buying these days . It's hard to imagine a time when Tom Baker wasn't universally known as the Doctor but there was & this documentary brilliantly tells the story of how it all came to be , how he got the part & ends on the admission regarding his overnight fame that he'd rather be rich & have no privacy than poor & anonymous which is fair enough I suppose . Are Friends Electric ? is an excellent DVD documentary , it's as simple & straight forward as that & is far better than one would expect & much better than the usual bland self promoting Hollywood ' making of ' documentary's . A great documentary on a great DVD for a great Doctor Who story .
496942	1355507	681736	8.0	" If you want to get into bed with Quincy it's up to up . " The butchered 44 minute edit . . .	Quincy M . E . : . . . The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone . . . starts as LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) gets ready to take a forensic pathology class at a local university , one of the students has brought in a thigh bone she found on a nearby building site for Quincy & the class to have a look at . Quincy's interest in immediately raised when he discovers not only is the bone human but show's signs of a nick which was probably caused by a bullet , attempts to find the rest of the bones at the building site fail & neither his boss Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) or LA cop Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) are as convinced as Quincy the bones owner was murdered . Together with his enthusiastic students & his lab's equipment Quincy sets out to discover as much as he can about the bone , who it belonged to & if they were murdered . . . Episode 3 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Alex March & I have to say that this is perhaps the absolute quintessential Quincy episode that showcases everything that was great about the show . Before I carry on I have to say that I saw the butchered 44 minute version rather than the original 75 minute one , I presume these longer episodes ( which this was the last ) were edited down to the standard Quincy length for maybe repeat runs to bring them in line with future shorter episodes that were made after the 75 minutes ones or to conform to a specific one hour time slot , certainly here in the UK Quincy has always been shown in a standard weekly one hour time slot . Anyway , while I have never seen the longer edit of this one the short one works perfectly well & is one of my very favourite Quincy episodes that contain many of my favourite Quincy traits , the humour & banter between character's , the way he uses his medical skills & knowledge to reconstruct an entire person from one single bone , the way he solves a murder because of it , the way he fights bureaucracy including his own boss & the police force , the way he sticks up for & defends his own opinions & findings when all around him are questioning them , his obligatory impassioned speeches , the character relationships are just great with real chemistry & there's a really neat murder mystery plot here as well that grips & holds one interest right through to a good solid ending . Since this has over half an hour cut out of it one would hope it moves along at a nice pace & it certainly does , I'm not sure if the extra footage really changes the episode or whether anything vitally important was cut but it seemed fine to me & all the major plot points seem to be there & it makes perfect sense . The one thing that sticks out during this episode as a plot hole is that the killer managed to convince the victims father that his son volunteered for & was killed during fighting in the Vietnam war in 1957 , I'm not being funny here but the first U . S . combat troops didn't arrive in Vietnam until 1965 . . . This one also has some horrible opening credits which omit the ' gentlemen you are about to enter the most fascinating . . . ' speech at the start & an episode of Quincy without that just seems odd to me , I'm not sure if the rest of season 2 also used these credits though . The acting is alright although it's Klugman again who is just brilliant in the role , I also have to mention Asten & the horribly dated hat he wears at the start as it looks ridiculous ! . . . The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone . . . is brilliant Quincy , from the fascinating medical techniques he uses to uncover & solve a murder to everything that makes Quincy great as a series , it's all here although bear in mind I saw the 44 minute edit . . .
499130	1355507	36027	8.0	" Your not seriously trying to tell me my patient is a zombie ? " Fantastic , atmospheric early 40's horror .	I Walked with a Zombie starts in Canada where a nurse named Betsy Connell ( Frances Dee ) is offered a job in which she would have to travel to an island named St . Sebastian in the West Indies to care for Jessica Holland ( Christine Gordon ) the invalid wife of a plantation owner named Paul ( Tom Conway ) , she accepts the position . Once there Betsy discovers that Jessica has no will or mind to call her own as she just walks & stares into space , nothing else . As the days pass Betsy begins to hear stories about how Jessica ended up in the state that she has , Dr . Maxwell ( James Bell ) claims a tropical disease that damaged her spinal cord while she also hears tales of Voodoo curses & the like . Betsy feels sorry for the Holland's , when medical science fails to provide a cure & not knowing what to believe anymore she turns to the ancient tribal Voodoo rituals of the natives to try & cure Jessica . . . Directed by Jacques Tourneur & produced by the legendary Val Lewton for RKO pictures I Walked with a Zombie is one of the finest early horrors out there that I have seen , if not the finest . The script by Curt Siodmak & Ardel Wray is apparently based on the novel ' Jane Eyre ' by Charlotte Bronte & is wonderfully structured , there is always a fine between the real cause of what has happened to Jessica , whether it's sinister Voodoo or something more mundane like disease . Maybe Paul was responsible out of revenge because Jessica wanted to leave him for his half-brother Wesley ( James Ellison ) or maybe their mother ( Edith Barrett ) didn't want Jessica to break the family apart , the superbly written dialogue really helps to keep things murky & interesting . The story is strong although it's up to the viewer to decide in the end , I liked the openness of I Walked with a Zombie . The love affair between Paul & Betsy is a bit abrupt & unrealistic but I suppose it could happen . On the negative side not that much actually happens & if your looking for hordes of flesh eating zombies then forget it , it's not even made totally clear whether Jessica is a zombie . Director Tourneur does a marvellous job here & creates some wonderful atmosphere throughout using light & shadow to fantastic effect , I absolutely loved the shots of Jessica & Betsy walking through the cane field at night as the wind blew & ruffled the crop & their long elegant dresses , I could almost feel the cold chill of that wind in my front room . The spooky tower with it's spiral staircase , the Voodoo rituals & more besides . I Walked with a Zombie is a very visual film that evokes emotion , I loved the look & feel of it . Forget about any violence , just a hanging animal but that's not what I Walked with a Zombie is about . Technically the film is a good as any from 1943 can be , sure it may not impress too many people these days but I think a lot of time & effort was put into I Walked with a Zombie & is far superior to most horror films from this period that I have seen . The acting is OK although some of it is a bit wooden by the supporting cast members , Gordon as Jessica doesn't say a word during the film yet you still feel for her . I Walked with a Zombie is surely a true classic of the genre & I wholeheartedly recommend it to all horror fans & anyone else who enjoys well written , well made films . Having said that if you want explosions , blood , bad language , computer effects every few minutes & can't sit through a black and white film then I Walked with a Zombie is not for you . A bit of a gem .
497071	1355507	82000	8.0	silly and stupid but also fun and entertaining	I really like this movie , I don't care what anyone says . The opening shots of this movie are of a cargo ship drifting into new york , and two people in a helicopter watching it and reporting back to base . The next scene is at the docks , we are informed that pilots boarded the ship and docked it safely . Three men in white radiation suits and masks enter the ship and start looking around . They find lots of mutilated corpses . In the hull they also find a green pulsating egg / pod thing which explodes and sends lots of green slime / goo everywhere . Two of the men make the mistake of taking their masks off and as a result their chests and stomachs explode sending lots of blood and intestines flying everywhere . The third man who kept his mask on escapes and reports back to his superiors . The alien contamination of our planet has begun . So someone has to stop it , but who ? Who do the United States government pick to save the world ? The bloke ( Marino Mase ) who survived in the ship , sexy Col . Stella Holmes ( Louise Marleau ) and a boozy ex astronaut Hubert ( Ian McCulloch ) . Great choice I feel safer already . I think this is a great movie . A great musical score , good gore efx , goofy overacting , a silly script that moves like a rocket and a tacky rubbery monster at the end , what more do you want ? This movie seems to get a lot of harsh things said about it , well what I say is that if a movie entertains you for an hour and a half then it must have done something right , right ? Lots and lots of fun to be had , give it a chance .
497947	1355507	257106	9.0	" I'm fine . . . I broke my fall . " Absolutely hilarious to those with a slightly twisted sense of humour , like me . . .	Scary Movie 2 starts at ' Hell House ' as Father Mceely ( James Woods ) & Father Harris ( Andy Ritcher ) perform an exorcism on the possessed Megan Voorhees ( Natasha Lyonne ) . . . Jump ' One Year Later ' where professor Oldman ( Tim Curry ) & his wheelchair bound assistant Dwight Hartman ( David Cross ) select various students to accompany them to Hell House to experience & measure paranormal activity . Cindy Campbell ( Anna Faris ) , Buddy ( Chris Masterson ) , Brenda ( Regina Hall ) & Shorty Meeks ( co-writer Marlon Wayans ) , Ray Wilkins ( co-writer Shawn Wayans ) , Theo ( Kathleen Robertson ) & Alex Monday ( Tori Spelling ) are all told by professor Oldman that they have been selected to stay at Hell House for a weekend to study various sleep disorders for a school project . Once there they discover the freakish servant Hanson ( Chris Elliott ) who quickly becomes the least of their worries are they encounter the evil ghost of the previous owner Hugh Kane ( Richard Moll ) & a whole host of other spooky goings on . . . Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans Scary Movie 2 was the first sequel to the horror spoof Scary Movie ( 2000 ) , the series is now up to Scary Movie 4 ( 2006 ) , & I personally thought it was better than the original & quite simply I found it totally hilarious . The script by Marlon Wayans , Shawn Wayans , Alyson Fouse , Greg Grabianski , Dave Polsky , Michael Anthony Snowden & Craig Wayans spoofs just about every well known horror film there is from The Legend of Hell House ( 1973 ) , The Exorcist ( 1973 ) , Poltergeist ( 1982 ) , The Shining ( 1980 ) , Hollow Man ( 2000 ) to Hannibal ( 2001 ) & it spoofs all other sorts of film from various genres like Charlies Angels ( 2000 ) , Harry Potter , Mission : Impossible II ( 2000 ) , Rocky ( 1976 ) & Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) to name but a few . I must admit I had a great time trying to spot them all & I'm sure any film buff would , although I doubt many film buffs would agree with the way Scary Movie 2 treats these classic films . There are also some swipes at a few topical issues that were prevalent back then like the Bill Clinton ' affair ' . At only 85 odd minutes long Scary Movie 2 moves along like a rocket with a constant stream of bad taste & gross out gags that I just found really funny , I haven't laughed so much during a film for ages , I don't really know what that says about me & frankly I don't care either . Director Wayans keeps the humour coming thick & fast , he seems to want cater for the lowest common denominator with a succession of gross bad taste gags from toilet humour , poo , fart , puke , spunk , sex , masturbation , drugs , paedophile priests , racism , sexism , gay jokes , a ghost helping himself to a blow-job in a pretty female students mouth , plenty of foul language including a funny Budgie & even the disabled aren't safe as Scary Movie 2 is one of the most politically incorrect films I've ever seen . There are plenty of jokes in Scary Movie 2 that I would imagine many would find offencive which is fine I suppose but I will openly say right now that I found the disabled jokes funny , the racist humour amusing & all the bad taste gags hilarious & frankly I have no problem saying that although I would imagine many would . It doesn't make me a racist or look down on those with disability , I think the whole world's gone political correctness mad anyway . With a supposed budget of $45 , 000 , 000 Scary Movie 2 very well made with great special effects & loving recreation of various classic scenes from films . The acting was good & everyone played their parts really well whether they were serious or campy & that Anna Faris is really rather hot . I loved Scary Movie 2 , I found it hilarious , it's as simple & straight forward as that . In a world that's gone mad with political correctness Scary Movie 2 isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything & seems to have no boundaries , I really can't remember laughing so much during a film , I really can't . If your prudish or easily offended then avoid Scary Movie 2 like the plague but if you like crude juvenile gross out humour then it's an absolute must see !
497918	1355507	95444	10.0	" They took your wife away in a balloon ? You don't need the police pal you need a psychiatrist . " Brilliant .	Killer Klowns from Outer Space is set in the small Californian town of Cresent Cove where Mike ( Grant Cramer ) & his girlfriend Debbie ( Suzanne Snyder ) witness what they think is a shooting star land in some nearby woods , they decide to investigate & come across what looks like a huge Circus tent . They venture inside only to discover a room with what looks like cotton candy cocoon's hanging from rails , they take a closer look & discover that dead people are wrapped in the stuff . They run for their lives as large alien killer klowns chase them , they manage to escape & get back to town in an attempt to warn the local Sheriff ( John Allen Nelson ) but he understandably doesn't believe them when they talk of killer klowns from outer space . However it's true as the rest of Cresent Cove start to find out to their cost as these klowns intend to either have some fun by killing us in increasingly bizarre ways or cocoon us to use as food ! Co-written , co-produced & directed by Stephen Chiodo I think Killer Klowns from Outer Space has possibly the greatest film title ever & more importantly is total brilliance , it's twisted & bizarre & messed up & outlandish but it's still brilliant , this is probably my favourite horror comedy that I have seen & one of my very favourite films period . The script by brother's Stephen , Charles & Edward Chiodo moves along like a rocket , it never takes itself seriously & could easily be seen as an affectionate homage to the small town alien invasion sci-fi horror films of the 50's . I love it's twisted sense of humour , I love the messed up idea of these killer klowns who use all sorts of Circus & Carnival type tricks with a dark & sinister edge to them to kill people , from killer hand shadows to a lethal puppet show to fatal acid pie throwing ! I love it , the contrast between our normal concept of a clown being all funny & innocent is used to great effect as these klowns are pretty creepy . The various set-pieces have & show good imagination & are easily recognisable as to what clown routine is being twisted for evil purposes . The character's are OK although the Terenzi brother's in their ice cream van start to become annoying . I don't know what else to say really other than I love this film & just about everything about it . Director Chiodo does a great job on what was probably a low budget for such an ambitious film , first thing to say is that the killer klowns themselves look fantastic . They really do have the perfect blend of clown cuteness & dark ugly menace , I could watch these guys all night long . The special effects range from very impressive to just about the worst you've ever seen , the majority of the effects are very good with the klowns themselves standing out as being just plain brilliant creations & the huge ' klownzilla ' at the end is also impressive although the effect where the klown is riding thin air alongside the car is quite simply one of the most embarrassing effect scenes I've seen . Still , only one truly bad effect in a film such as this isn't bad going , is it ? The whole film has a nice dark sense of humour with a scene involving a klown using a dead body as a ventriloquist's dummy by sticking it's hand into the bodies back is particularly eerie & effective . The gore is tame , there's nothing more than a decapitated head & a melted skeleton . If you get the opportunity check out the funny music video by The Dickies to their ' Killer Klowns from Outer Space ' theme song , which I have on my iPod ! With supposed budget of $2 , 000 , 000 there's a lot to this film & you get the feeling a lot of time & effort was put into it . The production design is good with the interior of the killer klowns spaceship looking suitably psychedelic & colourful . I liked the soundtrack especially the erm , ' unique ' theme song by The Dickies . The acting was OK from an unknown cast but it's definitely the killer klowns who steal he show here . The late John Vernon makes an appearance as a bigoted cop . Killer Klowns from Outer Space is absolutely brilliant as far as I'm concerned , you know when you sit down to watch a film & everything works for you & you just end up loving it but your maybe not quite sure why , well that's Killer Klowns from Outer Space for me . I've seen Killer Klown from Outer Space numerous times now dating back to the late 80's & I've loved it every time I've seen it , I'm not sure I can recommend it to everyone as it probably takes a certain type of film-goer to appreciate it but it's a film that I adore on many levels , hell I even like the way they changed the word clown to klown in the title !
