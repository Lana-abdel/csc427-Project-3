552686	989035	289879	1.0	Pushy , ugly disenfranchised youth flick disguised as a thriller . . .	Young boy with a perplexing , unexplained medical condition - - blacking out at crucial points in his life , only to wake up later confused about what has transpired - - grows into a rambunctious college student proud that he hasn't had a black-out in seven years ( I would think the fact he has avoided jail-time after his run-ins with delinquency would count for much more ) . After re-reading his childhood journals , he finds he has the ability to go back in time and change the past , which gets him into more trouble . Written and directed by J . Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress , " The Butterfly Effect " is a supremely crass , supremely empty movie . It wants to be audacious and button-pushing , but for whom ? Disenfranchised , multiplex kids with bad manners ? It presents its supernatural hook only to dress up a much more familiar issue : why unsupervised , anti-social teens turn to violence . In the lead , Ashton Kutcher , also an executive producer , walks through the picture hunched over , rolling his eyes ; if its possible that the movie represents anything - - such as , say , a lobotomized society of young people - - Kutcher's non-acting does nothing to give us hope . Kutcher is not rebellious , nor alienated , nor intrinsically smart . He's not a funny wise-ass . His vacuousness is used for guilt - - not shame , just boring old guilt - - and yet his expression barely changes in between ghastly episodes . The film is targeted at audiences of the lowest common denominator ( much like the characters depicted on-screen ) . They will surely praise it . . . to put the movie down would be admitting self-defeat . NO STARS from
553205	989035	113303	1.0	The pits . . .	Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident , family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily ; a doctor brings him back to life , but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side : he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women . Based on a Dean Koontz novel , this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across . Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters - - nobody behaves the way regular people would . Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife , Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor , Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective . They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation , which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz ( if it didn't , it should have ) . Just back from the hospital , Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video ; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking - up - with - a - jolt - from - a - nightmare close-up ( and the movie doesn't disappoint ) . Turns out there's a killer in town ( Jeremy Sisto ) who gets around from place to place with effortless , alarming accuracy ; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel - - which isn't even listed with information - - he's holed up at a derelict amusement park ( seems he conveniently has the place all to himself ) . Of course , nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter ( Alicia Silverstone , who does nothing but whine ) , nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger . The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point , though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride . The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful , one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged . NO STARS from
551569	989035	818516	1.0	Bottom-dweller David Lynch-wannabe co-starring Martin Sheen's brother . . .	While at a wedding reception for another couple , a self-doubting groom-to-be spies a platinum blonde in a white satin dress giving him the eye ; intrigued , he follows her into the ladies room , but she vanishes . Later , out on the road with his fianc√©e , the young man apparently hits the girl with his car , only to learn that she's a ghost - - the legendary jilted tramp from years gone by who perished with a doomed soul ! What might have passed muster as a short-subject from a student filmmaker is elongated here to an excruciating length , filled with amateur performances , crass dialogue , flashy editing which serves no purpose except to confuse , T & A interludes , and bright red blood . Star Jason Ryan Lovett has the granite jaw and solemn manner of a misunderstood hero from a 1960's B-flick , but he isn't given the proper material to showcase a personality . Low-budget film isn't ghastly , though it shows no imagination , no style . Hopefully for Lovett , better projects are around the corner . NO STARS from
551001	989035	95924	1.0	A thriller on life-support . . .	Writer-director Paul Golding's abysmal , completely forgettable thriller distributed by a major studio ( Columbia ) but filled with low-rent talent . Story has a young boy ( Joey Lawrence ) attempting to save his dad and stepmother from evil , unseen forces within their home . As the stubborn father , Cliff De Young once again gives his usual knucklehead performance ; he has made a specialty out of playing impatient grown-ups who have no ear ( or use ) for the truth , and yet we're supposed to care what happens to the guy ? Lawrence is kept near the verge of hysteria throughout , but this begins to look pretty silly - - especially when there's not much happening plot-wise . from
552269	989035	113497	1.0	Recommended only to those who find elephant destruction awe-inspiring	It took four - - count ' em , FOUR - - screenwriters to conjure up this adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's book about a man imprisoned in a supernatural board-game , freed by two precocious tots , setting off a chain-reaction of incredible disasters . Muddy , confused sideshow is mindlessly busy , held together for the most part by the special effects . The film is slickly designed to appeal to hyperactive kids , yet it hasn't an ounce of brains - - or any sensitivity to the humans or animals involved . Directed in a soulless , sledgehammer style by Joe Johnston and starring Robin Williams , sadly at his lowest ebb . from
552646	989035	113729	1.0	Teen rubbish	Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse , along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance . I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence ( scored with an abominable rock song ) ; unfortunately , it does . Boy meets girl at school , they flirt , they date , they run off together . The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced . It isn't a fresh spin , although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new , and who knows ? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments . To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating , not to mention terribly irresponsible , and not quite the " wild and sexy adventure " advertised . NO STARS from
551359	989035	114658	1.0	Whoopi Goldberg is almost always worth watching . . . almost	From the What Was She Thinking ? file : Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur ( ! ) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age . Straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous , a high-concept in search of itself . Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director , Jonathan Betuel ( who also served as one of the producers ) ; sadly , the end results are anemic , to be charitable . Goldberg's mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script , but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results . NO STARS from
552343	989035	120382	2.0	An unattractive idea , given an unfocused treatment	Rarely have I seen a major motion picture that looked as awful as this one does . We get the fact that modern suburbia is supposed to look like a plastic paradise out of a TV commercial , but the colors here are tepid , the camera set-ups dull and unimaginative , and the direction mechanical and without a hint of inspiration . Jim Carrey , playing Truman ( whose life is a TV show though he doesn't know it ) , shows off his dreaded " range " as a performer ; he's always on-camera a second too soon and stays there seconds too long . This is also the fault of the director ( Peter Weir ? ! ) and the editor , who hope we in the audience don't miss any of their tricks . How could we when the whole set-up of this story is as plastic as the town's inhabitants , or when every gesture is as subtle as a pack of stampeding elephants ? from
552362	989035	80881	2.0	Pre - " Porky's " smut	Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer are ostensibly the stars of " The Hollywood Knights " , but cheap , flashy Robert Wuhl walks away with the picture ( though that's not a mean feat ) . Playing hell-raising youth Newbomb Turk , Wuhl is glinty-eyed like a mischievous pervert , causing non-stop comic chaos on Halloween in Beverly Hills , 1965 . Predating " Porky's " with the same locker-room humor , the flick apes " American Graffiti " and " Animal House " but substitutes wit with raunch , sexual embarrassments , and male-bonding over smut . It didn't catch on with audiences in 1980 but gained a small cult on cable . If there's anything good about the picture it is Wuhl : taking charge , as if he were the visiting brother of Belushi , Wuhl bellows and cackles and urinates in the punch bowl . It's tough for any actor to upstage Michelle Pfeiffer , but Wuhl proves it can be done ( and with C-minus material ! ) . from
551326	989035	466909	3.0	Jazzier violence , otherwise pointless . . .	It's almost impossible to discuss this remake of the 1976 thriller without constantly comparing the two versions - - it's a very basic updating , using much of the same screenplay and yet upping the ante on the violence ( for that extra , " Final Destination " - like kick ) . An American Ambassador and his wife living in England find the behavior of their young child Damien strange and foreboding , while the husband hides the secret he exchanged the baby at an Italian hospital when theirs was allegedly stillborn and yet another child was orphaned at birth . Doomsday thriller wasn't exactly a masterpiece back in ' 76 but did have a chilly look and atmosphere , terrific lead actors , and even a little boy who - - with very few lines - - managed to convey an eerie impertinence with his expressions . This kid is a vacant , heavy-lidded , older-seeming child who looks too lanky to be carted around in his mother's arms ( he seems like an extra from a Goth-rock music video ) ; as the Thorns , Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber have the opposite problem - - they're too young . Stiles in particular fails to convince as a political wife ; she tries for an authoritative presence , but she's neither this nor the motherly type - - she's just playing dress-up . Mia Farrow is interesting as the boy's evil nanny , but this version has her feeding the boy chunks of meat ( what ? ? ) and playing goody-two-shoes with the hospital staff that drains all the immediacy out of the suspense . Quite lackluster overall , mismanaged from the outset and not very scary . from
550580	989035	190590	3.0	Handsome production , but awkward , detached serio-comedy isn't too funny . . .	Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached , occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen . Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune , and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process ! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum . It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic , Gableesque mugging , and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music . Otherwise , the screenplay ( by the Coens ) is seriously lacking in humor and interest , supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift , and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence . from
551383	989035	44665	3.0	Bourbon Street balderdash . . .	Would-be ' hard-bitten ' product from MGM suffers from too many disparate ingredients . A retiring newspaperman in New Orleans reflects on his best subject : a prize-fighter named Socks ( ! ) who infamously deserted a boxing match at the eleventh hour ; after stints as a huckster and as a soldier in the Korean War , he makes a celebrated comeback . This may very well be revered director Raoul Walsh's worst film - - but really , no director could segue smoothly between these slabs of superficial melodrama , including a fighter with neuroses , his ballet-dancing girlfriend , her blind father the Judge , and a jazz-singing , trumpet-playing member of the troupe . As an early vehicle for Ralph Meeker and Leslie Caron , it's a wash-out ; neither star is shown to a good advantage , although Caron's jerky choreography is an odd hoot and Meeker does look great in boxing gloves . Louis Armstrong's final musical number in a barroom is rousing - - and his general good will is infectious - - yet the music , the milieu , and the material never quite come together . from
551908	989035	59462	3.0	" Merlin Jones " is back . . . but film looks like some quickie B-flick	Say what you will about Walt Disney's silly suburban comedies of the 1960s , they at least LOOKED good . Walt always ensured a decent production and usually threw in some nifty visual effects for the fun of it . The exception is " The Monkey's Uncle " . After a spunky start with Annette Funicello singing on-stage with The Beach Boys , this movie settles into Sitcom-ville with tired results . Worse , it looks terrible , with flimsy walls that are supposed to pass as sets and terrible use of color photography . Rarely have I seen a movie that looked so bad , with lots of yellow meringue and pea-green curtains and costumes . Having enjoyed " The Misadventures Of Merlin Jones " for what it was , I expected Disney to up the fun-quotient with this sequel , but it's a real snooze . from
552412	989035	59453	3.0	Moody , curious , but ultimately unenthralling melodrama	Amnesiac James Garner tries to sort out his apparently complicated past . This adaptation of Evan Hunter's book " Buddwing " ( and retitled " Woman Without a Face " for its overseas release ) looks terrific but is a distressingly unsatisfying soaper . Photographed by the great Ellsworth Fredericks in crystalline black-and-white on autumnal New York City locations , the movie is saddled with an annoying plot which never comes together . Full of top talent , but only Suzanne Pleshette gives off some heat as a savvy actress . The film attempts to be modern and risqu√© , but the writing is so ham-handed and the direction so self-consciously arty that the final result just seems alienating and unabsorbing . from
552968	989035	134630	3.0	Too-slick valentine to karaoke . . . with no vitality off the stage	Writer John Byrum and director Bruce Paltrow ostensibly had a good idea - - to catch the fever of semi-professional karaoke singers in action - - but maybe this subject might have been better served by a documentary . Byrum's hackneyed plots involving the troubled performers never take off , and Paltrow's staging of the musical numbers is far too slick . How much excitement can you work up when your karaoke singers are lip-synching ? Gwyneth Paltrow , playing a child-like woman who is reunited with her estranged father , is a lovely presence , yet hiding her intrinsically smart and savvy personality here does her no favors . The most surprising thing about the picture is that Paul Giamatti can carry a tune , although he's distinctly studio-enhanced , as if the producers were hoping to get a hit soundtrack out of this thing . Small wonder the movie flounders ; it's calculated and colorless . from

Hollywood great Michael Curtiz directs Boris Karloff in this middling thriller about an ex-con , just out prison , who is framed for a judge's murder by racketeers ; after he's convicted and killed in the electric chair , a team of scientists revive him . Fatigued entry in the 1930's horror-movie cycle doesn't allow Karloff to do anything fresh or substantial ( indeed , several of his big moments seem lifted straight from " Frankenstein " ! ) . Curtiz can't do much with this hackneyed scenario , and he's certainly not helped by the unsurprising script , though there is one strong sequence at a piano recital . Otherwise , " The Walking Dead " is d . o . a . from
551471	989035	72253	3.0	Frigid drama of Cold War romance = icy bore	It's nice to see Julie Andrews trying a straight dramatic role here - - something she hadn't done in awhile - - but her character of Judith ( wise they didn't try to pass her off as a ' Judy ' ) has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore , and Andrews enacts ' grown-up ' as any other actress would interpret frigid . It's a surprisingly bland drama set in Barbados involving Omar Sharif ( not the liveliest leading man around - - not even in 1974 ! ) hoping to make Andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom . Unmemorable outing does have some camp value : the James Bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot . As for Julie : she's quiet and contemplative , but that doesn't do much for the audience , or for the film . Blake Edwards paces the freakin ' thing like a funeral . from
553480	989035	250720	3.0	Just the thing to kill off the motion picture once and for all . . .	Blatantly ridiculous . Decorated , heroic canine ( who apparently has the strength of a large man and understands the entire English language ) is separated from the FBI and ends up with an unwashed postal carrier and the little boy he's currently babysitting . David Arquette , talking like the first white hip-hop mailman , sputters about trying to be zany , and fares even worse when the paltry script suddenly requires him to be paternal to the kid ( who is either giggling or sulking ) . The sub-plot about mob boss Paul Sorvino putting out a hit on the dog actually provides the brightest moments , and hit-men Joe Viterelli and Steve Schirripa are able to come up with some funny repartee . Restless kids may go for it , and it isn't a completely shoddy production . from
553365	989035	212985	3.0	Withered sequel . . . with Hannibal our new Freddy Krueger	Overdue follow-up to Jonathan Demme's " The Silence of the Lambs " from 1991 reportedly cost a bundle to make , yet it looks grimy and ugly throughout . Where did all the money go ? Ridley Scott directed from Thomas Harris ' lackluster bestseller , bringing back both escaped killer Hannibal Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling , though only Anthony Hopkins returns from the original's stellar cast . Hopkins retains his evil panache , but it's the Freddy Krueger syndrome : more of him is really less . Julianne Moore is a weak Clarice , and our first glimpse of her - - asleep in a van next to a block of dry ice ! - - is immediately disconcerting not only because this is Jodie Foster's role , but also due to the fact Moore changes positions in the long-shot . Scott goes for a straightforward approach , yet this is nothing more than a thriller in shorthand . We get none of the mystery or suspense of the previous film , everything here is laid out quickly and then slashed at ( probably the best moment is the opening , which has an icy kick ) . The entire ending , much discussed here I'm sure , left me groaning . It's shock-stuff gone too far . from
552137	989035	78111	4.0	All style	At the beginning of this film , there's a tight shot on Brooke Shields ' baby face : she's watching something with interest and we hear a woman moaning just in front of her . Since we all know what " Pretty Baby " is about , one is to assume the child is watching some sexual act with curiosity . Actually , it's just the opposite . This is writer-director Louis Malle's clever way of laughing at the viewer , saying " You have the dirty mind , not I . " It's a very smart way to begin to the picture , but little else occupied my mind after it got going . Why would Keith Carradine's colorless older man want to marry a pubescent prostitute ? Nobody here is saying , especially not Carradine ( who has one sullen expression to express every emotion ) . The photography and background scoring are gorgeous , however the story and characters provide no passion , no emotion . The film is like a stylish painting , but one full of dullards . from
551511	989035	122689	4.0	A 1968 vanity project for the Stones , who get upstaged by the Who . . .	Long-shelved concert film was originally intended for British television in 1968 , but the Rolling Stones were unhappy their musical sequence was not as dynamic as that of the Who . The project languished in obscurity until it was found and received a theatrical release Stateside in 1996 . It's a raucous , shapeless extravaganza , a perfect example of content without form , providing some great music , a decadently cavalier atmosphere ( which is intriguing ) , but no food for thought . This is the only known appearance of the Dirty Mac ( who perform John Lennon's " Yer Blues " ) , but everyone gets upstaged by the Who , who really whip up a frenzy . As for the Stones : they clearly felt no threat another rock group was out to steal their limelight ; they are indeed exciting , but even more endearing is the old-fashioned , fire-eating circus stuff which doesn't quite jell with the music on hand but is amusingly presented nonetheless . from
552387	989035	52325	4.0	Run away , skiddaddle , skidoo	Painful farce , adapted from Peter De Vries ' novel which then became the kind of play dinner-theaters specialized in . It features Richard Widmark in a humiliating ' comedic ' role as a man whose wife can't get pregnant , leading him into a drunken excursion with a sexy adoption agent , whom he later believes he has knocked up . Widmark is not suited to this material , which should be played nimbly and without force . Director Gene Kelly , of all people , is likewise not suited to guide an intense actor like Widmark through the rigors of light comedy ( which can be more precarious than a gangster drama ) . Doris Day is the put-upon wife , and I felt for her . Even with a feeble script and dim handling , Day manages a ray of sunshine or two . Gig Young , in the patented Gig Young / friendly neighbor role , helps out a little bit , but " The Tunnel Of Love " is a frigid affair . from
552472	989035	312329	4.0	100 % formula	Sloppy , sentimental boxing comedy-drama is based on successful female boxing manager Jackie Kallen's tough rise to the top ( ' loosely inspired ' seems a more appropriate term ) . Meg Ryan plays Kallen with a streetwise edge in her voice and is appropriately cast , but her outlandish wardrobe certainly belies the salary of a glorified secretary , and Tony Shalhoub embarrasses himself as a ' Godfather'-styled kingpin of the boxing mecca ( he dresses and talks like John Gotti , but only seems to have one client ) . Charles Dutton directed , and his own performance as the veteran trainer ( yet another clich√© ) is at least warmly thought out - - ironically , it's the best acting here . " Ropes " is a lackluster film , put together and distributed as if nobody involved had a hope in hell for it . The boxing scenes are slapdash , with Ryan walking right across the ring at one point to deliver a last-second pep-talk to Omar Epps , the kind of conspiratorial speech that is older than dirt ( why doesn't she just say , " Win one for the Gipper " ? ) . Omar's rise to success is swifter than a bad odor , which is pretty much what this misfire leaves in its wake . from
553424	989035	78034	4.0	Caustic comedy with leering , mean-spirited asides . . .	Two years before he wrote and directed " Arthur " , Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for Henry Winkler , then TV's " The Fonz " . A 1950s college thespian ( and all-around jerk ) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon ; to make ends meet , he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling , eventually becoming a " Gorgeous George " - like celebrity . Turning likable Winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time ( and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego ) , but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean , staged rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner . Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving Herv√© Villechaize ( of " Fantasy Island " ) putting the moves on Polly Holliday ( Flo from " Alice " ) . As Henry's beloved , Kim Darby looks a little out of her element - - particularly when surrounded by all these TV hams - - rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential . from
553724	989035	78721	4.0	Sloppy mixture of slapstick and a hipster's idea of smut . . .	Writer-director Blake Edwards is so out of the loop he can't even fake being hip . This middle-age-crazy concoction , about a self-absorbed songwriter chasing after a youthful vision of beauty , has elements of lust without passion , broad comedy without skill , and pathos without anything substantial in the screenplay to back them up . When he's not tumbling , bumbling , or shrieking like a Cockney banshee , Dudley Moore struts smugly through the film , narrowing his eyes and pursing his lips in a fake imitation of an older man trying to look cool . There's nothing witty or surprising in this lumpy set-up , which includes Julie Andrews as a salty toughie with a sentimental side and Robert Webber as Moore's gay writing-partner ( far be it for Edwards to miss out on a stereotype : the broken-hearted homosexual ) . Dudley can't even hide behind some flowers without getting a bee-sting to the schnoz , and he can't get a bee-sting without his nose naturally swelling up like a balloon . Bo Derek's corn-rowed infatuation inadvertently becomes the picture's drawing card , and for good reason : she's the only one here not putting on airs . from
553684	989035	183649	4.0	Everyone is on the phone in New York City !	Joel Schumacher's mercilessly overheated " suspense " drama has cocky publicist Colin Farrell trapped in a phone booth by a sniper who knows all his dirty secrets . Seems cell-phone addict Farrell uses the public phone to ring his girlfriend , thus his wife of one year won't get suspicious when she sees the bill . Beginning with the caveat this slick , smarmy player is actually married ( to a clean-cut good girl ! ) , none of the details in " Phone Booth " manage to convince , least of all the psychopath ( voiced by Kiefer Sutherland ) who turns out to be smarter than his victims and the entire New York City police department combined . There's a surprising amount of talent behind this film , but it's a one-trick pony , resting on a mighty thin script which doesn't allow for any spontaneity . Farrell does a good job under the cramped circumstances , but Forest Whitaker's police Captain seems to take an awfully long time to assess this situation correctly . So , the hookers across the street saw a gun in Farrell's pocket ? Well , they must be right ! Aren't prostitutes the most reliable witnesses in the Big Apple ? from
551003	989035	473174	4.0	Another failed gay comedy , this one with tacky stereotypes	A frightened-seeming heterosexual in his mid-30s and an eyeball-rolling gay salon owner " meet cute " and , despite their differences , become movie buddies ; still , everyone close to the straight guy misinterprets this friendship as an intimate relationship , causing him to question his own sexual preference . Simplistic , unamusing comedy of misunderstandings , with overdrawn , ' kooky ' supporting characters and a basic lack of verisimilitude in the leading ones . Strictly as a superficial light entertainment , this low-budget film is relatively harmless and friendly enough ; dig deeper however and it's really rather offensive - - both to straight and gay audiences . Jonathan Bray's Todd , with his perpetually astonished expression , is like a walking loaf of white bread , complete with uptight clothes and a clenched jaw ; neither sex could loosen this man up . . . and neither sex would take the time to . from
552883	989035	95178	4.0	Molly Ringwald : camp Lolita or serious thespian ?	Molly Ringwald , softer and more contemplative than in her John Hughes / high school comedies , plays a shady girl from the wrong side of the tracks who meets and has an affair with preppy Cincinnati college kid Andrew McCarthy ; the fact his rich friends disapprove and she has such a questionable background may prevent things from going further . Not a terrible movie , but filled with self-defeating clich√©s and occasionally overwrought dialogue . Ringwald struggles a bit with her redneck accent , and McCarthy does nothing to elevate his pinched , emotionally-parched persona , but the look of the film is quite vivid and the atmosphere is well-captured . Perhaps it was a good idea to re-team the teen lovers from " Pretty in Pink " in a more grown-up setting , but the filmmakers didn't go far enough with the idea , and the coy finale seems a little undernourished . from
551405	989035	59496	4.0	Not a thriller - - and not much as a drama - - it has almost nil appeal . . .	Evelyn Piper's novel becomes another Bette Davis vehicle made in the wake of Davis ' second-act success starring in creepy melodramas ; unfortunately , the tools are not present in Piper's material for Miss Davis to make a grand show of it , and the film version seems strictly bush-league as a result . Prim English governess may or may not be responsible for the drowning death of a young child . Potentially intriguing scenario never livens up , and director Seth Holt restrains Bette to the point of her seeming catatonic . Hammer Films production is overwhelmingly gloomy , not scary , and the supporting players are of little help . Colorless and largely forgettable . from
550849	989035	114478	4.0	Improvisational drama without much on its mind . . .	Character-oriented piece from director Wayne Wang centering on the owner of a New York-based smoke shop , his offbeat client√®le and assorted colorful friends . Heavily improvisational - - yet only intermittently interesting - - " Smoke " managed to create a small cult with audiences and critics , although neither the actors nor Paul Auster ( the credited screenwriter ) have anything important to say . It's imperative in a talking-heads movie like this to create a beguiling inner-sanctum , a small universe within this store with its rapidly changing groups , but Wang only gets strong scenes out of Harvey Keitel and Ashley Judd . Some interesting bits and pieces ( and a moving finish ) make the picture worthwhile for art-films fans . Followed by the sequel " Blue In The Face " in 1995 . from
550616	989035	149691	4.0	Phony star-driven vehicle . . .	Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior . Apart from several good sequences , I didn't quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake ( she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady ) , and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent . Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid , and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work ( and some of her scenes , such as the one where she asks a boy to strip , are misguided and uncomfortable to watch ) . Certainly not an incompetent piece , " Anywhere But Here " does have moments that work , but it isn't an embraceable film , nor has it proved to be an important one . from

Two-and-a-half hours of grim uncertainty , staged by Robert Aldrich like a cross between " And Then There Were None " and " Lawrence of Arabia " . With Captain Stewart over-enunciating all his dialogue ( as if he'd gone deaf or , perhaps , thought the rest of us had ) and the other men performing in a game of one-upsmanship , the drama at hand becomes stilted and inert . The characters are stock anyway , and the clich√©s begin to pile up like sand dunes . Turgid , occasionally laughable adventure , remade in 2004 . from
553682	989035	134619	4.0	Thriller about robotized teens - - made for robotized teens . . .	Youthful variation on " The Stepford Wives " ( and perhaps even " The Parallax View " ) has square-jawed James Marsden - - a jock-equivalent of Tom Cruise - - playing a high school misfit ( ! ) , relocated East from Chicago and finding a clique of sweater-wearing , easy listening-loving teenagers to be more dangerous than they first appear . In a movie about kid-zombies , Marsden is the biggest fake of all ; with the built-in apologia that his character has gone off-course because of his brother's suicide , it is still completely unacceptable for model-perfect Marsden to be palmed off as a have-not ( he'd be readily accepted at any high school , and the stoners who befriend him here wouldn't stand a chance ) . It's a disastrous piece of casting , not helped by the slang-heavy dialogue , sounding as if it were written by a high school drop-out armed with a thesaurus . Katie Holmes attempts to smolder as another hellion , complete with nose-ring , but her jaded eye-rolls and expressions don't do much for her or the picture . The heavy whiff of cynicism throughout is daunting ; and though the movie is remarkably well-produced , it hasn't an original thought or idea in its head . from
551774	989035	88044	5.0	Sick ! Stupid ! . . . but I certainly wasn't bored	Call " Savage Streets " what it is : trash . However , it is amusing , lowest-of-all-levels trash , and I enjoyed Linda Blair's upfront , colorful performance as the vengeful big sister of a rape victim . The dialogue is hilariously vulgar and self-conscious , and the girls ' locker room sequence ( filled with naked babes - - as if this were a women-in-prison flick ) provides just about the final word in exploitive cat fight scenes . The tone wavers from campy juvenalia to psychotic melodrama , and the extreme violence ( as well as the rape scene ) is tough to stomach . However , the film's goal is to be cartoonish junk , and that is surely realized . from
553309	989035	78158	5.0	Good cast and interesting teenage characters sacrificed for yahoo thrills . . .	Disney's sequel to their not-bad 1975 hit " Escape To Witch Mountain " brings back Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards as the teen-tykes from outer space , here battling wits and powers with villainous Bette Davis and Christopher Lee ( and their chauffeur , Anthony James , who also played a chauffeur alongside Davis in " Burnt Offerings " ! ) . Well-enough made , but the movie loses sight of what was so special about the first film ( a kid's flick with the emphasis on character , not overtly outlandish special effects ) . Davis is alert and anxious , but she's practically smothered under the gaudy make-up and is left to chew the scenery without benefit of a strong script . Poor Christopher Lee has it even worse , blending into the foreground action while the kids steal all his scenes . The plotting gets too heavy in the final third , what with Los Angeles about to be decimated and delinquent children running amok , but the worst decision was to separate siblings Tony and Tia for much of the movie . Some good sequences , Jack Soo does nice work in a warm supporting bit , and a goat nearly saves the day ( and gets a big " thank you " to boot ! ) . from
552413	989035	43859	5.0	Nobody ever had as sane a freak-out as Jimmy Stewart . . .	Rather unpleasant melodrama , often referred to as " No Highway in the Sky " , has fidgety scientist James Stewart flying in a crowded plane that he believes will suffer from metal fatigue ; convincing the other passengers they are in great danger becomes quite a problem . Although the film stretches its central idea out to the breaking point , resulting in some highly annoying theatrics , this is the perfect showcase for Stewart to exercise his now-perfected brand of nervous shtick . He stutters and stammers trying to make his logistics palatable , only causing consternation . Stewardess Glynis Johns and cool-headed actress Marlene Dietrich attempt to decipher Stewart's post-textbook noodlings , and both performances are exceptional . Otherwise , it's a squarely straightforward " disaster " movie without much gripping action . from
552856	989035	352248	5.0	Hoary boxing-movie clich√©s abound !	Heavyweight champ James J . Braddock looks back on his humble beginnings : in the Depression Era as a washed-up boxer with a broken hand and a revoked license , he struggles to take care of his wife and three kids before making a miraculous comeback . Director Ron Howard builds every scene as something extraordinary , while his throwaway bits ( such as a married couple fighting in front of a church , or a man walking out on his wife ) are hammered home with little subtlety . Howard constructs the film disappointingly , with a flashback segue intervening about seven minutes in , and with principal actors who look pained , perplexed or disinterested . Ren√©e Zellweger , playing Braddock's fiercely devoted wife Mae ( who sews under a single lamp while her kids always seem to be in bed ) , is stuck with lines like , " When you get hit , I feel it , too " . This is the passive , loving wifey movie fans have seen since the beginning of time , and Zellweger does absolutely nothing original with the part ; Russell Crowe has some strong scenes as Braddock , but our introduction to him , smugly collecting his money after a fight , is curiously sour . He and Zellweger have no screen chemistry whatsoever , and their dialects and acting styles clash . The smaller roles are filled with scenery-chewing overachievers , and Howard is shameless in allowing them to hold nothing back ( everything is done ' colorfully ' , for effect , and the film plays like a ham sandwich ) . This true story comes hilariously " pre-approved " with a quote from Damon Runyan , with period detail that is careful but disappointing . The whole enterprise suffers from boxing fatigue . from
551174	989035	87799	5.0	Lively , sloppy Valley girl sci-fi . . .	Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney are exceptionally cute as cynical California siblings from the Valley who survive the nuclear holocaust and spend the rest of the movie fending off radioactive mutants . Mary Woronov , always a great presence in B-flicks like this , is unfortunately stuck in the draggy sub-plot about brain-dead scientists , and the film's sloppy continuity and muddy cinematography are poor , yet the two girls are wisecracking fun . The movie , lively and silly , adopts a rather enjoyable slant on the marauding zombie genre , sending up the precarious scenario - - the end of civilization as we know it - - in such a campy , overtly-dumb fashion that it couldn't possibly be disturbing ( except perhaps to science-fiction devotees , who will most likely just laugh it off ) . from
552097	989035	70379	5.0	A barrage of artistic overtures and general indulgence . . .	Director Martin Scorsese kicked around the indie circuit and second-unit work out in Hollywood before breaking through as a director with this melodrama set in New York's " Little Italy " district . Harvey Keitel plays a struggling Catholic trying to keep clean , and the character is most likely a highly personal one based on Scorsese in his early days ( or someone very close to him ) . Intelligently-made film about desperate characters living on the edge isn't especially profound , though it is intrinsically exciting in a show-offy way . Scorsese , who also penned the screenplay with Mardik Martin from Scorsese ' original treatment , proves to have an uncanny knack for kick-starting a scene using pop and rock music to its best advantage , and , in his now-characteristic way , he intermingles all his violent , tough-talking characters with the stunning assurance of a technical veteran . Keitel's performance is adept and multi-shaded , though Robert De Niro doesn't quite make that initial strong impression . from
553718	989035	78723	5.0	Slapstick static . . .	Director Steven Spielberg's first theatrical misfire has bombastic humor and amped-up energy to spare - - all it needs is a sharp , merciless editor to eliminate its excesses . Made up of equal parts " I Wanna Hold Your Hold " and " Animal House " , the film opens with a spoof of " Jaws " that is funny and well done . The USO sequence is alive and crackling ( any of the scenes with Bobby DiCicco and Dianne Kay are good ) , however John Belushi's Captain Wild Bill Kelso is a nuisance ( perhaps recasting Belushi in Treat Williams ' role of Corporal Sitarski might have saved some time ) . Buried under the morass is a fitfully funny spoof of wartime , although I tired easily of Ned Beatty running around with a shotgun . Robert Stack is wonderful , and the scenes between Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen in the airplane are fine if overextended , just like most of the bits and pieces in " 1941 " . It has gloppy cinematography , messy comic staging and unconvincing sets . Spielberg's hopes for a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad War surely include isolated moments of inspiration - - even brilliance - - but those moments get trampled in the traffic . from
551952	989035	60457	5.0	Goblins ! Ghouls ! Girls ! . . . Geronimo !	Representing the ( somewhat fatigued ) tail-end of the " Beach Party " saga , minus Frankie and Annette , this haunted house comedy has some style in the live-action cartoon vein , but is hurt overall by an unenthusiastic cast and too much chatter . Sleepy Tommy Kirk and distracted Deborah Walley are involved in the reading of a will in a spooky mansion ; Susan Hart is a sexy apparition ( wearing a dopey-looking blonde wig for F / X purposes ) ; Boris Karloff saunters through , tossing off droll comic lines in a debonair manner ; Harvey Lembeck returns as Eric Von Zipper ( although he doesn't look happy about it ) ; and Nancy Sinatra is one of the teens there for a slumber party ( she sings " Geronimo " poolside in the film's best sequence ) . Not terribly witty or lively ; most of the kids on display are artificially frantic and ' nutty ' , waving their arms about . The movie desperately needs more music and more special effects . It relies too much on the talk-heavy plot , which is its weakest link . from
552503	989035	43116	5.0	Smart , funny dialogue and songs . . . but the casting works against the plot	Remake of 1943's " Coney Island " ( both starring Betty Grable ! ) has Victor Mature ( in suits and straw hats ) playing a hustler-showman conning old acquaintance Phil Harris into going in business together in 1890s Chicago . Seems nightclub owner Harris has scuffled with a rowdy drunk and believes he's killed him ; Mature holds this over his head and steals his girl in the process ! Screenwriter Charles Lederer has penned a great deal of smart , sassy patter ( broken up every now and again by cute musical numbers ) , but he fumbles what little plot there is . Lederer also isn't helped by the casting : Phil Harris seems like such a genuinely nice guy ( with a big , gregarious smile ) that Mature comes off a bit cold-hearted by contrast ( he's not the dashing romantic intended ) . Grable is very lively on stage and funny in a catfight scene with a showgirl ; she keeps a heated temper throughout and gives the movie a good goosing . Also funny is Margaret Hamilton in small role as a crusader for decency ( no one displays comic indignation better than Hamilton ) . Fox production values a bit low , although the trick photography during a ferris wheel sequence is well done and Harris has a funny bit there inadvertently proposing to a sailor . from
553683	989035	120857	5.0	It seldom finds the appropriate flavor . . .	Young boy from a broken home is ' adopted ' by a group of elderly British women in pre-WWII Florence , Italy . Director Franco Zeffirelli's rather self-conscious valentine to his own childhood is slushed with poetic sentimentality , most of which feels distinctly artificial . The young lad at the heart of the piece isn't at all memorable , and the ladies unfortunately fare no better ( but where else can you find Cher , Judi Dench , Joan Plowright , Lily Tomlin and Maggie Smith together on-screen ? ) . Some of the more subtle moments ( such as the child waiting for someone to pick him up after school ) touch on a velvety kind of youthful longing that is rather sweet , but the drippy dialogue and obvious " scene stealing " opportunities for the femme stars drain much of the sincerity from the mix . from
552613	989035	79576	5.0	Their futures were foretold at the conclusion of the original . . .	So why did we need " More " ? It must've been a corporate decision - - with financial gain the bottom line . If so , that plan didn't quite work , as " More American Graffiti " failed to catch on with its target audience , mostly due to the fact it reflects not the 1960s but TV sitcoms derived from ' 60s nostalgia . Ron Howard and Cindy Williams ' story plays like a " Happy Days " rerun with bad language , however Charles Martin Smith's Vietnam episode is vividly captured - - and the idea of him trying to blow off his own arm in order to get back home says more about the war than " The Deer Hunter " did in three hours . Paul LeMat has some good scenes flirting with a pretty Swede , while Candy Clark kicks around as a kooky hippie . The film , produced by George Lucas , is full of colorful distractions : multi-image cinematography , constant period music on the soundtrack , and lots of overacting . Unfortunately , nothing can distract from the laziness of the writing , nor from the film's somewhat tiring concept ( which feels awfully gimmicky ) . The episodes aren't shaped with much thoughtfulness , and the film is insensitive and preconceived . from
551399	989035	44121	5.0	" Who Goes There ? "	Military workers and scientists near Anchorage discover the wreck of a flying saucer and thaw out its passenger , an alien monster who quickly wreaks havoc . From a short story by John W . Campbell , who originally had the Thing taking on the personalities of its victims ; this film-version , directed by Christian Nyby ( with the uncredited assistance of producer Howard Hawks ) has been reworked but not revitalized - - it ultimately seems diluted , what with a talky exposition and slim plotting in the second-half . The memorable black-and-white cinematography is terrific however , and the players thankfully do not lapse into camp histrionics . The 1982 remake , while filled with gory effects , retained the original vision of Campbell's material . from
551457	989035	97322	5.0	Script-writing in short-hand . . .	Two-brother piano act , growing stale through the years , gets big boost after acquiring sultry female singer , the torchy type who is unafraid to hop atop a piano to deliver a flirtatious number , and who eventually - - and inadvertently - - comes between the siblings while seeming to be unaware of her own allure . All the good acting in the world can't quite make these characters work . Michelle Pfeiffer's sugar-puss-songbird is a writer's creation ; wide-eyed and innocent at the emotional ruckus she causes , and yet street-smart enough to beguile us with her wise-ass nonchalance , she seldom makes logical or emotional sense . Jeff Bridges gets to moon over her like a drunken has-been in need of a haircut-and-shave , but poor Beau Bridges is given little to do ( in the kind of third-wheel role never envied by anybody ) . And when all is said and done , are we supposed to feel proud of the chanteuse who was compelled to do her own thing after getting her feet wet with this unremarkable duo ? She spreads her wings all right , but the character is all a clich√© .
552190	989035	103253	5.0	" A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do . . . "	Ken Russell's " Whore " begins with an amusing shot of cars driving through a tunnel ( R-rated Freudianism ? ) coupled with a Jamaican rap on the soundtrack about doing the " boom boom " with girls . Russell , who directed the film and co-adapted the screenplay from David Hines ' play , is highly adept at quirky bits of business - - blending hammy , outr√© comedy with blunt-force dramatics - - but with " Whore " , his mix of in-your-face , sexually-comedic bits and pieces are not always compatible bedmates next to the violence or the introspective moments . Theresa Russell plays Liz , a streetwise hooker full of bravado ; often addressing the camera directly , Theresa speaks with an odd swagger in her voice ( as if she's channeling someone standing beside her ) . Striking amazing poses - - like Lolita all grown up - - Theresa Russell has some choice moments ( usually when she's not speaking , as with a silent come-on to a guy who turns out to be gay ) , but she is not a vulgar , cartoony actress and is too refined to be slutty . Her performance continually improves , however it isn't in the actress's nature to talk tough like a lady truck-driver . Though the film is neither sexy nor even memorable , it does have well-wrought sequences ( such as when Russell's friendship with a possible lesbian is interrupted by a vicious pimp , an incredible moment done without principle dialogue ) . Those looking for a raucous good time will be disappointed ( can you imagine how this film's inelegant title looked on the movie theater marquees ? ) , and those hoping for a more serious take on the prostitution business probably won't stick around past the first hour . Indeed , there are many scenes that simply fall flat , but " Whore " is a definite mixed-bag ; it's not a deep-thinker , it's not exceptionally revealing , but it leaves an impression behind , along with some giggles , some embarrassment , and some sadness . from
553441	989035	32904	5.0	Glossy , arch society comedy . . .	Society divorc√©e , planning her next wedding , becomes involved with her ne'er-do-well ex-husband , who's in cahoots with a magazine writer doing a piece on the rich and pampered . Philip Barry's play comes to the screen starched and pressed . The classy cast is more than adept at this type of smart-talking fluff , yet too much of Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart unfortunately turns Cary Grant into the proverbial third wheel . The film's second-act tails off from the first in energy and wit , with far fewer laughs and more boring chatter . The material ( cast with these actors ) seems awfully staid and familiar , like a rerun , perhaps because Hepburn played her role on Broadway and doesn't approach the script fresh . James Stewart won an Oscar , as did Donald Ogden Stewart for his adapted screenplay ( which must've caused Philip Barry discomfort ) . The picture isn't a cinematic experience at all - - it's a filmed stage-play . Later transformed into the 1956 musical " High Society " . from
553520	989035	70509	6.0	The craziness of the first-year law student . . .	Timothy Bottoms battles through his first year at Harvard Law School , attempting to stay one step ahead of his no-nonsense professor , but inadvertently falling for the instructor's comely daughter ( Lindsay Wagner , pre - " Bionic Woman " ) . Director / screenwriter James Bridges adapted the script from John Jay Osborn , Jr . ' s book , and does a pretty good job realizing the many pressures of academia . Bridges was the perfect director to work in 1970s cinema , and , with Gordon Willis ' cinematography , he brings a gritty yet unshowy style to the movie that looks good without ever seeming pretentious . On the other hand , there's nothing very colorful about lectures or study groups no matter how polished the handling . Certainly worth-seeing for the acting alone , with John Houseman giving an Oscar-winning supporting performance ( he was later tapped to the star in the television spin-off ) . from
552505	989035	61418	6.0	Bloodshed in the American Dustbowl . . .	Although numerous chapters in cinema manuals have been dedicated to Arthur Penn's violent , jagged , cynical " Bonnie and Clyde " - - and , indeed , it kick-started a new permissiveness in America movies which then generated many imitations - - the first twenty or so minutes of the picture are really awful . Depression-era waitress , bored and thrill seeking , finds herself drawn to a smooth-talking , reckless hood , an ex-con who , when playfully dared to , robs a general store right in front of her . He's sexually impotent but does have a sympathetic heart for the unfortunates and the working class ; she's a high-wire act , strictly amoral and greedy . Their initial meeting outside her house has all the conventions of a standard 1930s drama - - and just because the movie's look is generally correct doesn't mean what's happening on the screen is original . Producer Warren Beatty and screenwriters Robert Benton and David Newman envisioned the French New Wave in regards to the film's approach and style , and their efforts paid off in this respect ( it's a very good-looking picture , shot by Burnett Guffey , who won an Oscar ) . However , Arthur Penn's direction isn't visionary , and the multiple car-riding shots with back projection don't seem to break new ground . The film's greatest achievement aside from its textured look and feel is the casting : Beatty and Faye Dunaway do pretty marvelous work in the leads ; Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons also fine as Clyde's brother and sister-in-law ( Parsons won the film's second of two Oscars as Best Supporting Actress ) . The violence grows increasingly , steadily , as the film inches toward its queasy conclusion , while Penn juggles ( successfully at times ) ribald character moments with deadly serious - - and bloody - - scenes ( which also became fashionable ) . The sweat and the flies , the downtrodden and the righteous , they all get a work-out in this scenario , which , in its best moments , has a prickly-comic and dangerous edge . from
551636	989035	112641	6.0	Mobsters in Vegas , as filtered through the ice-cold sensibilities of Martin Scorsese . . .	From Nicholas Pileggi's factual book about a mobster's immorality and downfall in Las Vegas , NV from 1973 to 1983 . Despite sweeping cinematography and palpable evil at nearly every plot-turn , " Casino " seems a " Goodfellas " retread . Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead , but Joe Pesci , as De Niro's surly back-up , does nothing new and Sharon Stone , as De Niro's wife , is just the ' token woman ' , trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with ( she's satisfactory ) . Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters ' actions than their motivations , causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end . The film is fast-paced and entertaining , but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind , and some of the violence verges on self-parody . from
550883	989035	43709	6.0	Suspenseful , but awfully unpleasant . . .	Anyone who remembers Maurice Evans ' kindly turn as Mia Farrow's friend in " Rosemary's Baby " may be shocked to find him so convincingly evil in this gripping melodrama . Ethel Barrymore plays a sharp , sensible woman who gets taken in by a con-man ; he moves into her house and she quickly becomes his prisoner . The plot is infuriating ( we in the audience feel like prisoners , too ) and the inevitable turning-the-tables ploy seems to take a long time coming . Still , Barrymore's plight is played to the urgent hilt , and Evans ( along with his brutish cohorts , Keenan Wynn and Angela Lansbury ) is downright despicable . The handling of this story , previously filmed in 1936 with Aline MacMahon , twists all the right screws with grueling accuracy , but calculated pictures like this may turn off many viewers before the final act . Ultimately , too many plot entanglements are left ignored and some crucial moments take place off-screen , but strictly as a masochistic thriller , the film is queasy and indeed suspenseful . from
553098	989035	60748	6.0	Another big hit for Steve McQueen	Henry Hathaway directs this successful , but lumpy , wayward western-drama scripted by John Michael Hayes , featuring a title character originally introduced in Harold Robbins ' book " The Carpetbaggers " ( making this film a prequel of sorts ) . Steve McQueen is the young half-breed avenging the deaths of his parents by heartless cowboys Karl Malden and Arthur Kennedy ; Brian Keith plays a mentoring , sympathetic gun-salesman who teaches Steve how to shoot ; Suzanne Pleshette is a love-interest from the backwoods . Overripe scenario gets big boost from charismatic McQueen , excellent as usual . The supporting work from the men is also strong , though attractive Pleshette hasn't gotten a handle on her role and remains a puzzlement . The story strays all over the place , but Hathaway's pacing never drags and it's quite a good show for both western-buffs and soap fans . from
550552	989035	104694	6.0	Plastic nostalgia . . . but Geena Davis and Lori Petty are perfectly cast	A modern-day reunion of WWII-era women's league baseball players brings back fond memories for one such lady , who recalls the journey she and her kid sister made to brief but tangible stardom in America's Golden Era . Director Penny Marshall's nostalgic valentine to war-time tomboys puts the squeeze on us right from the start ( with elderly actress Lynn Cartwright dubbed with Geena Davis ' voice , to ill effect ) . Marshall wants to make sure we don't miss any of her hat-tricks , some of which ( including a urination gag ) that misfire completely . The cast of high-spirited gals ( and Tom Hanks as their coach ) are alternately lively , wonderful , and excruciating . Rosie O'Donnell is a real chore stomping about on the field , but Geena Davis and Lori Petty ( as competitive sisters ) are genuinely charming , shrewdly cast , and nearly flawless ( a movie about them alone would be worth watching ) . The film isn't nearly as hearty as it wants to be ( the mechanical seams show right through ) , but the put-on sentiment may hook some . from
553112	989035	78841	6.0	Terrific acting , infuriating plot	It takes a huge leap of faith to buy the pesky little plot device rattling around in " Being There " . Peter Sellers plays a grown man with the intelligence of a six or seven-year-old . He has worked all his life for a recluse who apparently took him in , but now he finds himself on his own and is soon befriended by an ultra-rich and powerful political couple . " Chauncey " has never ridden in a car , been to the doctor or the dentist . Everything he knows comes from television . . . and TV keeps butting into the framework of this fragile premise . Director Hal Ashby doesn't want us to miss anything , and every ironic point is underlined twice ( such as with clips of inane TV commercials and , in one irritating case , an animated video that looks like the Harlem Globetrotters ) . " Chauncey " is accepted much too easily into the home of Melvyn Douglas and his beaming , slightly brainless wife . All the " normal " adults in the film have to , at some point , become idiots in order for this premise to work . It's dumbed down in order to get to the payoff ( the whole movie is a build-up to that payoff ) and when it came , I was surprised but not exhilarated . " Being There " is a one-trick pony . from
552112	989035	43319	6.0	Palm trees , red sunsets , gator wrasslin ' , and Terry Moore covered in mud . . .	Theodore Pratt's book becomes somewhat uncertain comedy-drama-adventure taking place in 1890 Miami , with land owner / confidence man Robert Cummings spreading word amongst the residents that a railroad will soon be running through South Florida . Jerome Courtland is the mail courier for the U . S . government who doesn't buy Cummings ' story , especially after both men begin vying for the affections of runaway teen Terry Moore . Initially fluff-headed nonsense turns serious by the second half , with murderous scavengers trying to halt the progress , and swampland alligators giving everyone the bite . Cummings , talking as fast as Robert Preston in " The Music Man " , looks every inch the dapper scoundrel , yet the writing doesn't give him a whole lot to work with ( the script is plot-heavy without ironing out the characters ) . The overlit , occasionally gloppy color photography isn't helped by sequences that change from location shoots to studio replicas in the blink of an eye , and the wavering tone is disconcerting , yet director Earl McEvoy manages to keep everyone's spirits up and the picture is seldom dull . from
551620	989035	43153	6.0	A musician's love and obsession for his music . . . filtered through the standard bio-pic clich√©s	Thinly-disguised movie biography of trumpet-player Bix Beiderbecke , with the standard rags-to-riches and romance clich√©s intact . Kirk Douglas is well-cast in the starring role , falling for society shark Lauren Bacall , who quickly drains him of his focus and inspiration until he realizes a need to return to his roots . Band-singer Doris Day is there for him , but she's made to be so wholesome she's akin to Douglas ' kid sister . The details don't add up , but the picture does look good and it isn't cloying . Day gets to sing in her bright , clear voice , and the music is pretty fantastic , yet the film is compromised by the Hollywood gloss , tidying up the sordid details in Beiderbecke's story to make it more palatable for skittish audiences circa 1950 . from
551306	989035	60491	6.0	Epic-scale adventure drama or history lesson ?	Bumpy , overlong drama does have magnetic sequences that stay with you . New England reverend ( Max von Sydow , who never elicits our interest or compassion ) sails to the Hawaiian islands with his wife in 1820 to introduce the natives to Christianity . Soapy plot taken from James A . Michener's book tries to cram too many years into 170 minutes of screen-time . The task of adapting the mammoth bestseller was probably a bad idea right from the start , and the picture is certainly a botch , but I did enjoy Julie Andrews as von Sydow's wife and the early scenes have atmosphere and tension . But Max von Sydow is a real problem : he's so overly-pious he's pathetic , which is probably not the effect hoped for . Look fast for real-life Hawaiian resident Bette Midler on the Eastern ship as it arrives to the island . from
553470	989035	52918	6.0	Liberally splashed with lavish trimmings . . . some may fall for it	Second version of the Fannie Hurst book ( previously filmed in 1934 ) is a gloss-heavy production which takes actress Lana Turner from penniless single mom to lavishly-coiffed and gowned movie star ; Sandra Dee plays her bitter , neglected daughter and John Gavin is Lana's eternal best friend . Sub-plot with maid Juanita Moore and her troubles with rebellious daughter Susan Kohner ( a black girl trying to pass for white ) provides the emotional backbone of the story , and both ladies do superlative work . Director Douglas Sirk's over-the-top send-off for one stricken character is designed to bring the house down - - though for viewers who have invested their all in these sudsy proceedings , that capper truly carries some memorable weight . Lana looks great , though her melodramatic suffering is rather plastic . The old-fashioned plot is so full of hot air it becomes inflated with self-importance , while the screenplay seems stretched out to an inordinate length . from
552504	989035	35415	6.0	Fortunes are gained and reversed with help from a ' cursed ' man's top-coat . . .	In New York , a man's dress coat , supposedly cursed by a disgruntled tailor , changes the lives of those who come in contact with it . They are : Charles Boyer as a suave actor wooing married Rita Hayworth , Henry Fonda as a nerd who stops Ginger Rogers from marrying skirt-chaser Cesar Romero , Charles Laughton as an aspiring musician , Edward G . Robinson as an unemployed alcoholic about to attend his class reunion , and Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters as poor black farmers ( another story starring W . C . Fields was trimmed in 1942 but later became a video edition bonus - - it adds nothing ) . Short stories told mostly in expert fashion , though some are obviously better than others . Fonda and Rogers are such an odd twosome that the second episode is probably the weakest ; the exceptional performances by Laughton and Robinson make those installments the strongest . However , the striking finale , complete with heavenly light and hallelujah chorus , looks so different from the rest ( and is filmed like a mini-epic ) that it appears to be a reel from another movie altogether . Overall , quite an entertaining piece for the actors , particularly Robinson - - who has never before been so vulnerable on-screen , the ultimate underdog . from

Ersatz Woody Allen , as it aspires to be , but not quite on the level of , say , " Hannah and Her Sisters " . Odd to see Mia Farrow here ( playing Sarah Jessica Parker's mother ) , as this is basically a retread of the work she was doing with Allen earlier in the decade . Parker is infectious , rattling off the sometimes-precious lines with professional aplomb , supporting cast is quite colorful , yet this tale doesn't have much of a point , and as a film it has no motivation beyond aping Allen . from
550990	989035	51534	6.0	Sophia Loren comes to Hollywood . . . results are mixed	After a couple of studio films shot on location , Italian actress and sex symbol Sophia Loren finally made it onto Hollywood soil for this uneven , uncertain melodrama adapted from Eugene O'Neill's controversial play . A tyrannical New England farmer ( Burl Ives ) , who apparently worked his past two wives to death , brings home a new wife to meet his sons - - two of whom take off for California and the third ( Anthony Perkins ) who stays and eventually falls in love with the Mrs . The performers seem to be at a mismatch with this very strange material ; though they try hard , the heavy prose and illogical situations would be enough to defeat anybody . The character motivations aren't always clear , not helped by the narrative which , at a crucial point , jumps ahead in time and nearly alienates the audience . Ives gives a full-throttle , blustery-old-windbag performance which infuses the scenario with a prickly tension ( and the screenplay surprisingly never scores points against him ) , but glinty-eyed Loren is a bit out of her depth . Still , she survives the absurd final reel with her dignity intact , while the picture ends on such a dour note that the overall impression is one of supreme dissatisfaction . Daniel L . Fapp won an Oscar nomination for his handsome ( if overlit ) photography ; Delbert Mann directed in an awkward and stagy fashion . from
550930	989035	36244	6.0	Solemn picture lays the speechifying on rather heavily . . .	William A . Wellman's earnest film from Walter Van Tilburg Clark's book is more somber than moving , though it does have a good central performance by Henry Fonda , here playing a righteous man attempting to stop a small town lynch mob from acting as judge and jury with the lives of three men fingered for a murder . These unfortunate suspects don't get much of a break from the bloodthirsty group on hand - - nor do they get one from this screenplay . In order to let star Fonda have the strongest scene , one of the men writes down his feelings in a letter , which Fonda's Gil Carter reads aloud . It would be a triumphant moment for any actor ; however , since we never get to know the convicted trio , the immediacy ( and perhaps the intensity ) of the emotional situation remains closed off from us ( the sequence seems designed more toward showing us what a good-hearted guy Carter is rather than underlining the evils of a mob frenzy ) . Considered heady stuff in 1943 , the picture is less compelling today , with the stagy production design giving the picture a ( perhaps deliberate ) artificial appearance . Jane Darwell is hissable in a supporting role ( a complete turn-about from her work in " The Grapes of Wrath " ) , but Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn are under-used . Wellman's direction is fluid yet unexciting . from
552770	989035	60176	6.0	Demanding , intriguing enigma doesn't meet you halfway . . .	David Hemmings plays a tireless , exacting fashion photographer in London who accidentally takes pictures of a murder ; he fleetingly gets to know a woman involved in the killing but can't break through her alienation ( or , indeed , anyone else's ) . Dazzling piece of colorful eye-candy has a careful , studied pace and a lot of desperate , moody characters . Unfortunately , the last forty-five minutes or so drops off sharply , what with mimes in the park and The Yardbirds showing up for a concert . Handsome film , sort of a cinematic enigma , will not please everyone , although swinging audiences from the 1960's really tapped into the stylish , chic confusion and isolation . from
553233	989035	25586	6.0	Davis gives a no-holds-barred performance in flawed first rendition of Maugham's book . . .	W . Somerset Maugham's novel , about a guttersnipe waitress in London who becomes the object of a smitten doctor's obsession , becomes intriguing film giving Bette Davis one of the first startling , showy roles of her early career . This melodrama , later remade in 1946 and 1964 , has a tendency to plod along , with disappointing cinematography and art direction ( the look of the film seems wrong , artificial instead of gritty ) . However , when mercurial Davis is front and center , one is apt to be drawn in simply by the look on her face or by the delivery of her lines ; Davis is so certain of her talents by this point , she cannot help but be mesmerizing - - to us and to herself . from
551815	989035	265591	6.0	Amusingly schizophrenic	Surprisingly sweet dark comedy is really too sentimental at heart to be the edgy piece it was promoted as , and the curious final results show definite signs of indecisive filmmakers ( two directors ! ) at the helm . A sorority princess living in a privileged bubble has her existence turned upside-down after forging a loving relationship with a mentally challenged young man , losing her friends in the process . The direction is erratic , and the tone of the film changes from scene to scene , yet it is certainly unpredictable and the cast is game . I don't know if the focus of the movie was changed midway , but the later sequences have a sweet nuance to them , as if a big softie suddenly took over to see this thing through to a happy ending . And then there's that final shot which , in keeping with the rest of the picture , is amusingly bizarre . from
553212	989035	36696	6.0	Smooth , leisurely-paced charmer . . .	Jules Dassin directed this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's story , a charming fantasy about the ghost of a coward haunting an English castle , aided by a relative who must perform a heroic deed to save the spirit from eternal misery . Despite a reportedly troubled production , the cast ( including big scene-stealer Charles Laughton and little scene-stealer Margaret O'Brien ) glides through it blithely , and Dassin's handling of the material is efficient , if perhaps a tad colorless . Robert Young and Peter Lawford are interchangeably bland , but there are some pleasurable moments . Perhaps not the most memorable apparition-laden comedy , but an enjoyable entry in the genre . from
553374	989035	44357	6.0	" I know how to get things out of people . . . "	Jean Simmons doesn't exactly have the face of an angel , but that doesn't mean she's miscast in " Angel Face " ; on the contrary , Simmons ' hard , placid neuroses get a worthy workout in this glossy noir , turning the film's title into an ironic gag . Even though Simmons is not a juicy or sympathetic villainess , she's a compelling one , and director Otto Preminger gets an even-keeled , non-campy performance from her . Robert Mitchum is typically sturdy as a shallow stud , an ambulance driver in Los Angeles who is swayed by the step-daughter of a wealthy socialite ; she wants to be his benefactor and his lover , but when her plans are spoiled she quietly seethes and plots . Complicated drama is absorbing and compelling , if infuriating and unpleasant . People like these most assuredly exist , but watching this no-win situation play out isn't exactly entertaining . Preminger turns the screws slowly and carefully , and while we're drawn in by the mechanisms of the plot , the characters are by turns heartless , selfish , thoughtless and contemptible . from
550687	989035	70748	6.0	Intimate strangers , unfamiliar relations . . .	Uptight , possibly frigid , panic-stricken middle-aged New York housewife has to learn to let go of the past , a refuge which doesn't necessarily bring her happiness but does provide her life with some kind of stability . Joanne Woodward gives a good performance here ; not at all vain , and unafraid to let herself be pinchy , selfish , or even annoyingly helpless , Woodward overcomes this rather dreary " woman's picture " material with thoughtful touches and nuances . It's a heavy load however , and she doesn't have much help until the final reel when her needling , provoking matron takes a European trip with her husband ( Martin Balsam , also doing fine work ) and she comes to see her humanity as something she can work with as opposed to frittering it away . Screenwriter Stewart Stern's dialogue is heavy with a writer's pretensions , and often the chit-chat is pedantic , forced and unreal . Near the beginning , Woodward gets a phone call from her mother and asks , " Who is this ? " A few scenes later , Woodward becomes exasperated with her husband and asks , " How many years have we been married ? " These moldy exchanges are lazy outs for a writer wanting to introduce us to the characters ; instead of letting us discover these people and their hang-ups for ourselves , everything is spelled out ( and poorly so ) . We are to understand that Joanne's estranged son is gay after she has a dream in which a male dancer is caught in the boy's bedroom - - in ballet tights ! The ' colorless ' color cinematography is a mix of putrid browns and greens , and director Gilbert Cates begins each new sequence with a big wind-up , as if the movie were starting all over again . The rhythm is off , and with lines like " You approach every new relationship like you would a toll-booth , Mrs . Santa Claus ! " , one doesn't know how to respond to the characters . It's possible that some of Woodward's jaunts to her past , both real and imaginary , will strike some viewers as very personal , but the film isn't especially moving , at least not until the final third . from
550649	989035	86154	6.0	Spacy Meg Tilly : the perfect ally for Norman Bates !	Anthony Perkins reportedly felt threatened as an actor playing opposite Meg Tilly ( portraying a slightly-dazed cupcake who befriends Norman Bates , just out of the asylum ) ; if true , he had good reason , for Tilly is very appealing in her role and this sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's classic screamer gains a spirit of its own - - away from its predecessor - - every time she's on-screen . The plot is business-as-usual , with a lot of repetitive , cornball dialogue ( " It's my mother ! " " No , it's MY mother ! " ) . It's great to see those famous sets again , and the filmmakers try to create a stylish , old-fashioned atmosphere at the outset , but a gory , dispiriting conclusion and a dumbbell tag at the end ( designed for another sequel ) weakens the whole shebang . out of
553351	989035	59616	6.0	Unblinking , unflinching inquisition of the Maid of Orleans	French filmmaker Robert Bresson used the actual transcripts from the trial of Jeanne d'Arc in order to reveal her character through her words in these final days . Bresson keeps leading actress Florence Carrez , a non-professional as are the others in the cast , speaking in a forthright monotone , without much vocal inflection or facial exaggeration in order for the viewer to concentrate solely on her words . His film is intentionally without scope ( and has very little exposition ) and some may find the cut-and-dried handling a bit pedestrian . Certainly it was financed on a minimal-budget , and some of the players are stilted , but the film's compact running time of 68 minutes works to Bresson's advantage : he's able to get right to the heart of things , and he leaves us with a haunting climax . That said , there were three things I didn't care for : the musical intro is so severe for an opening that it may provoke an indifferent response ( the matching closer is less irritating ) ; Joan seems to have a believer in one of the priests at her trail ( he sends her subtle signals ) but this isn't explained ( which may again be intentional ) ; and barefoot Joan's geisha-like quick steps leading up to the gallows are peculiar - - was it her decision not to walk with shoes , and was the ground so hot she had to practically dance to her death ? from
552410	989035	70794	6.0	Dryly humorous , engaging and well-cast . . .	Ryan O'Neal gives one of his better , looser performances in this crime-caper , a handsome comedy-drama involving a high society thief planning a major heist . Warren Oates is the investigator in dogged pursuit , Jacqueline Bisset ( at her most lovely ) plays a love-interest in on the action , Austin Pendleton is very funny as a nerdy chess pro , and wonderfully blithe Jill Clayburgh makes a big impression in the minor role of O'Neal's ex-wife . Engaging fluff with tongue wryly in cheek , well-directed by Bud Yorkin . Terrific non-think entertainment for cable-watchers , yet this did seem a little flat when it played in theaters . from
553429	989035	59253	6.0	" You're a national institution . . . like the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty ! "	The rise of Hollywood's first blonde bombshell , Jean Harlow , who died tragically at the age of 26 . Magna Pictures distributed this low-budget venture , which was first shot on an early form of videotape and then transferred to film . It competed with Paramount's version of Harlow's story ( also entitled " Harlow " and released in 1965 ! ) , but because of its unusual pedigree , this effort ( ambitious , if rough ) was hardly seen . Carol Lynley portrays Jean not as the raucous , lovable gal who made friends so easily , but as a volatile , impatient , often heartless young woman who wasn't quick to take good advice . Lynley does well in the role , even if her body type isn't right and her voice falls short ( her performance actually improves as the movie progresses , and she has a very strong scene with mama Ginger Rogers near the end ) . Some identities have been changed , and Harlow's first and third marriages are barely mentioned , but the movie makes its point with little pomposity : this was a troubled young woman who had no inkling of her own impact with movie-going audiences , constantly short-changing herself in the romance department . Rogers does solid work ; Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . , as a movie idol √† la William Powell , Hurd Hatfield as tortured producer Paul Bern , and Lloyd Bochner as a director are each excellent in support . Does any of it ring true ? Probably not . Writer Karl Tunberg seems to have constructed his script out of fan magazine articles , and the picture is fairly useless for those wanting to know the real dish on the 1930s superstar . Still , there are interesting accents and attributes throughout " Harlow " , and it is seldom dull . from
550598	989035	51074	6.0	Charmingly unconvincing	Jean Simmons never performed without vanity . Even here as a struggling sophisticate ( a schoolteacher who takes a part-time secretarial job in a " sleazy " nightclub run by guys named Tony and Rocco ) , Simmons is coiffed to the gills and everything about her breathes Park Avenue . This inconsequential drama-lite is peopled with lovable low-lifes and features a smoky but mostly scrubbed-clean hot-spot at its center , yet the energy and fake-pizazz may win you over . Paul Douglas and Tony Francisosa work well together as co-managers of the club , and Simmons ( nicknamed " Baby " ! ) is tolerable as the intellectual who improves their personalities . Good supporting cast includes Neile Adams ( looking like a cross between Carol Haney and a young Liza Minnelli ) as Joan Blondell's daughter , and Julie Wilson as a torchy singer who comes on like Patti Page . Robert Wise directed , under the usual MGM gloss . from
552332	989035	41253	6.0	" Don't get the trigger itch . . . I want no funerals on this picnic ! "	W . R . Burnett's book " High Sierra " , filmed in 1941 with Humphrey Bogart as a jewel thief , gets a rousing ( and uncredited ) western reworking here , with the main character's vocation changed to train robber . In 1871 Missouri , a criminal set for execution breaks out of prison and holes up in the valley with two of his cronies , where they plot another railroad heist . Director Raoul Walsh ( who also helmed " High Sierra " for Warner Bros . ) gets superlative usage out of the dusty , craggy locations , with cinematographer Sid Hickox capturing the mountain terrain and cloudy skies in gorgeously expressive black-and-white . Joel McCrea is surprisingly comfortable playing the semi-bad guy ( though definitely one with a heart of mush . . . and a yen for marriage ! ) , however some of the supporting characters are a bit of a stretch . Virgina Mayo ( she of the glassy-eyed stare ) does what she can in the insane role of an ex-dance hall girl , Dorothy Malone is completely lost in the underwritten part of a well digger's daughter who wants a better life , and John Archer and James Mitchell are two cardboard villains . The picture gets by on the strength of its considerable technical merits and by McCrea's performance ; with his easy gait and benign personality , McCrea is likable even when he's shooting down the law ( he's shrewd and sturdy , a good man to have around ) . However , the writing is overheated , and the nutty finale provokes unintended laughs . Story filmed yet again by recycle-happy Warner Bros . in 1955 , entitled " I Died a Thousand Times " . from
550569	989035	71959	6.0	Sensitive , well-wrought teen nostalgia with pathos . . . nicely-done of its type	Strict all-girl boarding school in 1955 Massachusetts is the setting for thoughtful , gentle , if familiar tale of two senior dorm roommates ( one tall and lovely , the other a flat-chested hoyden ) obsessed with boys and " doing it " for the first time . From " Blue Denim " in the 1950s to " Love With the Proper Stranger " in the ' 60s and " Racing With The Moon " in the ' 80s , it seems every generation gets a movie like this one ( usually set in the nostalgic past ) wherein sexual proclivities are often seen as life deterrents . Pamela Sue Martin doesn't have the range of a studied actress , yet her dryly engaged manner and mature , offhand observations ( mostly cynical ) make her an appealing screen presence . Betsy Slade , on the other hand , does seem studied , but this doesn't work for her wallflower character ( she's too world-weary , too ready to fall apart to really become embraceable ) . The film's ' 50s milieu is extremely well-judged , from the all-important ' mixer ' dance to the best mid-priced hotel , from the authentic cabs and cars to the desolate building of the nearest abortionist . Does the movie pack any more of a punch than your average TV drama covering this same territory ? Probably not , but it has a resonance that stays with one , even if the plot functions and characters have been utilized before , after , and since . from

Early talk of homosexuality in Hitler's ranks precipitated the reinsertion of Paragraph 175 , an old anti-sodomy law from the late 1800s , and gays were branded with the lowly Pink Triangle . Forceful documentary on a little talked-about chapter of history has just a handful of elderly witnesses but a superlative presentation of personally-shot footage mixed with telling photographs .

This long-unseen Disney item is full of color and music , but is obviously a holding-pattern release for the company . I saw it on video with the additional 20-minute documentary regaling more of the non-animated adventures , and this is quite entertaining . Never too popular with the kids , probably because a major cartoon segment involving Pedro the Airplane isn't very funny and lacks the local flavor . Otherwise , some visually dazzling bits , but not as good as the similar 1945 release , " The Three Caballeros " .

Well-written take on " Jane Eyre " has intriguing passages and a perplexing , but attractive heroine . Val Lewton's superlative production and voodoo atmospherics are wonderfully ripe .

551756	989035	79638	7.0	More than one actress's tour-de-force , an indelible and moving human story	In trying to get the textile mill she and her family work for unionized , Sally Field's Norma Rae Webster also tries to earn self-respect at any cost . She's been leading a dead-end existence : a single mother , still living with her family , sleeping with married men who abuse her . But after being inspired by a union-organizer ( Ron Liebman , in an Oscar-worthy supporting performance ) , Norma Rae is awakened to the possibilities of life , and , what's more , everything that is wrong with the mill that seems to suck the energy and hope from those who stand there day after day trying to earn an honest dollar . There are problems with the picture : Beau Bridges ' role as new husband Sonny is treated in a trivial manner ( he's supposed to be a voice of reason , but he's too smooth , maybe condescending , and it's an unconvincing character ) ; Oscar-winner Field's fiestiness occasionally feels overdrawn and / or one-note , but in many of the scenes outside the factory she does indeed excel , seeming vibrantly natural and exuberant . Martin Ritt's direction is focused and firmly rooted ( he never sugarcoats Norma Rae's character , and sometimes she's not that likable ) and the script manages to sidestep preachiness to get its points across entertainingly . The art direction is really the second star of the film : vivid , palpably hot and sweaty , with bits of cotton floating about in the air . The mill in question becomes very familiar to us , as do the people who work there . " Norma Rae " is involved and long , yet it is memorably bittersweet , and with a simple , haunting finish . from

What's a classy hoofer to do ? Kim takes up with a strapping , 23-year-old delivery boy who promises her the moon , which lights a fire ( finally ) under her boyfriend . With gritty New York City locales and fabulous Gayne Rescher photography , this ' woman's picture ' certainly looks terrific . It also features one of Novak's best performances , a fine job from a singing Tony Curtis , and lots of terrific character actors ( as well as Hefner's then-squeeze Barbi Benton ) in supporting roles . The sub-plot involving handsome lunk Michael Brandon doesn't really work ( his early scenes with Kim are totally fabricated ) , though it gets the picture where it needs to go , and the freeze-frame ending is downbeat yet provocative .

Director Brian Gilbert doesn't bandy about giving us the childhood torments of a literary genius ; instead , he and screenwriter Julian Mitchell delve right into the more prominent chapters of Wilde's life , his marriage to a woman - - producing two children - - before realizing his homosexual desires , leading to some promiscuous indiscretions before finding love with churlish , childish poet Lord Alfred Douglas . Stephen Fry gives a masterful performance as Wilde , and the portrait allows for many shadings ( this isn't a plea for the misunderstood gay artist , as Wilde himself is shown to be occasionally fickle , lusting , and selfish ) . Jude Law is equally good as ornery , demanding lover ' Bosie ' , whose tyrannical father brought about a court-case and two-year jail term for Wilde ( covered previously in 1960's " The Man with the Green Carnation " ) , contributing to his early demise . A provoking , insightful , eloquent film - - not at all stuffy or coy , which is due in large part to Gilbert's dexterous way with his actors and a keen sense of pacing and audience-involvement . from

Keeping the obvious sex-jokes at bay , the movie strives to create three-dimensional people and works most of the time . This is due in large part to Jennifer Aniston , an easy presence on the screen . The set-up is pure formula , but the results are occasionally offbeat , squirrelly , sometimes funny and moving . Story thread with Nigel Hawthorne as an elderly gay man who gets dumped-on shows the casual cruelty inherent in gay relationships , and this is handled with quiet taste .

Thoughtfully considered , well-acted made-for-TV drama stars Peter Graves as a family man on an excavation excursion with his kids in the California mountains who survives a radioactive blast followed by an earthquake ; slowly , the family comes to realize the astronomical proportions of the accident when they get back to town and find desolate streets . Writers Lewis John Carlino and Sandor Stern do not trivialize the situation with soap opera ; the budget may be slim , but the emotional experiences on hand for Graves and his children ( and two others they pick up along the way ) are harrowing . Cinematographer Michael D . Margulies does terrific work behind the camera , and the direction is solid except for some stiffness at the beginning and a voice-over narration that was unnecessary . Television movies really came into their own in the 1970s , providing capable TV actors with meatier roles than what was otherwise available to them in the form of popular weekly shows . This is certainly the case with Peter Graves , who retains his laconic , low-key persona but who also excels with some hard-hitting scenes ( such as a moment of private grief up in his bedroom ) ; Verna Bloom is also terrific as a mother who has seen her entire family decimated , and young Kathleen Quinlan is outstanding as Graves ' warm , maternal daughter ( this is a very underrated actress giving an early performance worthy of high praise ) . Worthwhile , unpretentious fare , a precursor to " Damnation Alley " , " The Day After " , and many others .

Chris Menges , who in 1992 directed the very fine , unusual Goldie Hawn drama " CrissCross " , takes on another curious , strangely moving film with " Second Best " . William Hurt plays a single , middle-'40's postman in a Welsh village who wants to adopt a boy . We learn why , and we also learn why the young boy who's been selected has such a mercurial nature , but these themes ( childhood-vs . - adulthood , rebellious-vs . - being loved ) , however topical , have been well-traveled . It is Hurt's performance which is something new . The way he moves his head quickly to avert an emotion or a confusion , the way he smiles when surprised . . . the man is , of course , an actor , but he's not actorly ; he's not a beguiling trickster , he is an actor of deeply human emotions . When he loses his temper at the kid , it's not unusual to find him saying the next morning that he's willing to continue on this path . It's a refreshing piece of work by Hurt , who I feel has been erratic since " Altered States " brought him to prominence . The youngster , Chris Cleary Miles , is kept low-keyed and he's very natural ; John Hurt is very funny and fine in a brief supporting role ; Alan Cumming looks a little theatrical and out-of-place as an adoption caseworker ( at first I thought there was going to be a dreadful sub-plot involving Cumming as a villain ; thank God there wasn't ! ) . A fine film , it does fiddle with a few camera tricks to convey emotions not in the script , but these flourishes were not necessary : the lead character and his desire to be a good , decent father manages to express a lot more . out of

Or when girlfriend Jill Clayburgh shouts at him , " I am no one-nighter ! I am a teacher ! I am going for my Masters !

Lengthy but well-realized , highly absorbing adaptation of a serialized Stephen King novel concerning prison guards in the 1930's who are profoundly touched by one Death Row inmate . Unpleasant subject matter ( and several vile supporting characters ) don't detract from the emotional value of the piece , which is professionally handled despite one or two small missteps ( an execution scene , for instance , which runs too long ) .

Intriguing story features an appealing Linda Blair playing popular young woman and horse-rider whose family takes in her orphaned cousin - - a perplexing girl who harbors secret evil powers . Craven's pacing is careful and sneaky , drawing the viewer in while mounting Blair's suspicions with just the right touch of creepy delicacy . Lee Purcell is excellent as cousin Julia , pulling off a showy role without lapsing into camp ( although the make-up and special effects near the finish are somewhat cartoonish by today's standards ) . A compact thriller , very well done , and Blair - - as always - - is charming and makes her character easily identifiable to viewers .

Dean Martin plays a drunken Texas sheriff saddled with a volatile situation : he's got custody of a killer who's in league with his strong arm brother , a well-known rancher who promises to set him free ; the sheriff enlists the aid of a drifting cowboy , a cantankerous old coot , and a guitar-pickin ' kid to outwit them . Howard Hawks directed western-lite is underpopulated , but is nevertheless full of wily good cheer , shootin ' , spittin ' and singin ' . John Wayne's cowboy is matched up quite nicely with ex-shady lady Angie Dickinson , while scene-stealing Walter Brennan gets most of the funny lines . Hawks later tried to duplicate this film's success with the lookalikes " El Dorado " in 1966 and " Rio Lobo " in 1970 , both starring Wayne , but this is the one you want . Handsomely produced and shot ; a whole lotta fun . from
550969	989035	192387	8.0	Fascinating restoration and behind-the-scenes gossip . . .	Chronicling the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork " Vertigo " , we get background information and amazing behind-the-scenes photographs and gossip about one of the greatest films ever made . I loved getting to see those rare pics of Hitch in San Francisco , and that original cover of the French novel " D'entre les Morts " , upon which " Vertigo " is based , is stunning ( try finding that in a pinch ! ) . Roddy McDowall narrates in his inimitable , non show-offy way . The quick interviews with Kim Novak , Barbara Bel Geddes and others are very enjoyable . Perfect for whetting the palate for a " Vertigo " viewing , so put them both on ( this one first ) for a stylish , informative evening .
552055	989035	79033	8.0	Viva Vaccaro !	Brenda Vaccaro never really fit into any conventional Hollywood mold ; even a brief stint as Michael Douglas ' real-life girlfriend didn't get her major press , so the lady had to find her own way . Terrific early spots in " Midnight Cowboy " and the Robert Mitchum mood piece " Going Home " didn't quite afford her a following , but in 1974 she got an Oscar nod as an unabashed man-chaser in " Once Is Not Enough " , and Hollywood finally began taking notice . In this TV-pilot / French film remake , Vaccaro really hits her stride playing a crafty crime-solver surrounded by colorful helpers ( including a charming Ron Silver , back when he really WAS charming ) , Brenda is feisty , funny , and totally into her character . The subsequent television series was also good but lacked the consistently strong writing of this opener . Years have gone by , but I still think of this movie and some of Vaccaro's expressions and responses . She's a gem !
551591	989035	79417	8.0	Very calculated and pressed out , but some of the manufactured heart is indeed moving . . .	The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ( " It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door ! " a neighbor tells us ) ; the busy , distracted husband takes on the " motherly " responsibilities and grows closer to his son , but soon the wife returns . Highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit ( with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep ! ) , but the dynamics are intriguing and involving , and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness , marvelous classical music , canny editing and surefire bits of humor . Streep's character is designed to be a cold , self-centered witch , but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted . It all has to be painted in terms of black and white , good and bad , with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent . The film never falters from its preconceived path , and very fine acting nearly saves it , but I'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act , and the closing scene is awfully abrupt . from
551749	989035	44223	8.0	Pure lyrical nonsense !	Both ridiculous and magical , this is a comedic fantasy which really works . Former armed forces dog - - a German Shepherd who just inherited a fortune from a wealthy people-hater - - is poisoned and dies , reincarnated soon as a private detective out to solve his own murder . This set-up may sound an awful lot like that Chevy Chase / Benji comedy from the early-'80s , but those who give up on the picture early will be missing a treat . The writing is ticklish and pointed , and the sharp handling is sprightly and lyrical . Dick Powell is , as always , wonderful in the lead , matched by amusing Joyce Holden as his assistant ( in her previous life , she was a horse ) . Sounds silly , but it works a special brand of wacky magic . from
550627	989035	52278	9.0	One of Clark Gable's best films - - Doris's too	Classy , rapid-fire comedy that combines " His Girl Friday " with any one of the Spencer Tracy / Katharine Hepburn battle-of-the-sexes . The set-up of the plot is rather hoary and contrived ( gruff city editor of a New York newspaper - - who is so anti-education that he hates the smell of chalk - - falls for a journalism teacher ) , yet the writing and the deft handling are so assured , you can nearly forgive the sitcom devices . The actress at the beginning of the film who begs Clark Gable to fire her son is such a wonderful , believable find that she gets the picture off on just the right note ; Gable and teacher Doris Day are lovely together , fighting and flirting and completely at ease in their roles . When Gable finally plants one on DD , she turns away in a huff , only to melt with wobbly knees . It's a fantastic moment in this unjustly forgotten , underrated classic . from
552163	989035	52357	9.0	From among the dead . . .	Alfred Hitchcock's " Vertigo " has a narcotizing effect , a lulling , dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off , which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it . Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love - - a suicidal woman he lost , but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past . Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's " Scottie " more so than any other character in his films , and , having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself , is careful not to let him have his way , so the climax may be disappointing to some . However , this glamor-mystery is blissfully gorgeous , fascinatingly written and extremely well-acted . Only one question : is the hotel manager ( Ellen Corby ) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad ? from
551913	989035	59793	9.0	Slick , smoothly-done laugh-getter	Not only does this Disney comedy feature the least-objectionable performance by Dean Jones EVER , it also has Hayley Mills and Dorothy Provine as a wonderfully kooky pair of suburban sisters AND a fantastic feline hero . This Siamese cat is just gorgeous , and it's a lot of fun watching the bumbling humans trying to tail him down alleys and city streets . The bad guys of the piece are also letter-perfect : threatening but not overbearing , just enough menace to make the kidnapped bank teller's scary predicament that much more real . I also loved the next door neighbors ( a wacky Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest ) , Hayley's surfer-boyfriend named Canoe , and befuddled Ed Wynn as a watch salesman . Simply put , a wonderful modern-day adventure for parents and kids . Puts the remake with Christina Ricci TO SHAME . from
553110	989035	90106	9.0	Intelligent , heartbreaking drama	Movies about suicide are certainly not going to be pleasant from the outset ( and I know several people who refused to watch " Surviving " simply because of its theme ) , but I think viewers will find something special here . Ellen Burstyn plays a doctor's wife and mother who clouds her life with activity so that she can't see what's really going on ; Marsha Mason is a friend of hers , a working mom who got fed-up a long time ago and can't muster the courage to care anymore . Their two eldest children ( Zach Galligan and Molly Ringwald ) are embarrassed by their parents , are convinced they are in love and wish to escape . The opening montage of family photos and the sad , wistful score is highly evocative ( and all the shots of Ringwald are fascinating - - she manages to convey depth of character even in still photographs ) . Mason has a more complex role than Burstyn , but Ellen ( after coming out of her fog ) has several strong scenes , particularly when berating her youngest son ( River Phoenix ) for taking sleeping pills ( " How COULD you . . . how COULD you , Phillip ? " ) . When Mason breaks down on her front lawn , it's tough not to cry right along with her . " Surviving " doesn't tug at your heartstrings for effect ( it's not " Love Story " ) , it earns the tears you give it . The film was notoriously snubbed at Emmy time and got surprisingly low ratings ; it's worth rediscovering . from
551723	989035	69704	10.0	Seems almost an accidental classic	I don't know if George Lucas really knew what he had in this picture - - surely the script seemed funny enough , and the thought of the cars and the period music was enticing - - but did he really know these " unknown " actors who bring these characters to life ? It seems almost a fluke , shot in 29 days and on a tight budget , but " American Graffiti " is a four-star classic . It is perhaps pure nostalgia , mixing pathos and humor , sadness and craziness , hope and reflection , in quiet little bursts of excitement . After cruising with Milner all night , teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does , waving from her porch with the light on ; Toad survives one bad accident after another , but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date ( fantastic , husky-voiced Candy Clark , dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee ) just before she says good night ; after chasing his dream date all night , Kurt ( Richard Dreyfuss , green and anxious , and appealingly bemused ) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone , where she whispers a wrenching goodbye . The whole movie is steeped in reflection . It has great , great humor , yet it leaves one with a bittersweet melancholia . For yesterday is in the past , with our music , our memories , and our hesitant farewells .
552353	989035	71115	10.0	Martin Scorsese in a rare romantic mood !	Starring the incomparable Ellen Burstyn , giving an Oscar-winning performance ( one of the finest of the 1970s ) , this comedy-drama is gritty and tough , but never off-putting . After her husband dies , 35-year-old Alice Hyatt from New Mexico and her smart-mouthed 11-year-old son Tommy take to the road , chasing her girlhood dream of finding songbird success in Monterey , CA . They get stuck in Phoenix , where she meets up with a frightening Harvey Keitel . Later , waitressing at Mel & Ruby's Cafe in Tucson , she meets a gentle farmer who's had his share of heartbreak . This is a perceptive , amusingly knockabout film regarding ordinary people trying to make it , episodes in their lives that enrich or derail them . Alice and her son have a wonderfully natural give-and-take , and the oddballs they meet on their odyssey ( like Jodie Foster's shoplifting tomboy or the sweet , overweight cowboy who gives Alice a singing job ) are deliciously silly , yet incredibly real . Burstyn is a joy cutting up with her neighbor in the backyard , having a Coke fight with her kid in a seedy motel , trading quips with Diane Ladd's salty Flo in the diner . Some critics complained that the happy ending felt tacked on , but you come to really respect Alice and her choices , and most of the film's little faults are camouflaged by director Martin Scorsese's bittersweet framing and Robert Getchell's vivid screenplay . Far superior to the TV sitcom , " Alice " . from
