551064	989035	78239	1.0	Robert Stigwood strikes again !	Music-biz impresario Robert Stigwood , head of the now-defunct , mostly-disco label RSO , produced several glitzy or garish movie musicals in the 1970s , this one being the very worst . Half-hearted attempt to turn music by the Beatles ( including the songs and mod look of their album " Sgt . Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band " ) into some kind of screen story ranks right up there with the most ill-fated ideas to leak from Hollywood . George Burns turns up as the Mayor of Heartland , narrating this " plot " about a resident rock group and their struggles with fame and fortune . Bringing together the Bee Gees with Peter Frampton may have seemed like a good idea when this was in pre-production ; truth is , 1978 saw a decline in both acts ' popularity , and the movie was pretty much dead on arrival ( the soundtrack sold better , but wasn't the blockbuster expected ) . Not showcasing the Bee Gees ' best attributes ( doing their sultry mix of disco and soul , and performing it live ) and instead trying to make the three of them actors almost killed their career . A few stray engaging moments , but mostly just embarrassing . NO STARS from
553205	989035	113303	1.0	The pits . . .	Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident , family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily ; a doctor brings him back to life , but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side : he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women . Based on a Dean Koontz novel , this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across . Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters - - nobody behaves the way regular people would . Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife , Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor , Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective . They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation , which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz ( if it didn't , it should have ) . Just back from the hospital , Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video ; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking - up - with - a - jolt - from - a - nightmare close-up ( and the movie doesn't disappoint ) . Turns out there's a killer in town ( Jeremy Sisto ) who gets around from place to place with effortless , alarming accuracy ; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel - - which isn't even listed with information - - he's holed up at a derelict amusement park ( seems he conveniently has the place all to himself ) . Of course , nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter ( Alicia Silverstone , who does nothing but whine ) , nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger . The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point , though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride . The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful , one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged . NO STARS from
553672	989035	96241	1.0	Jaw-droppingly bad	Whoopi Goldberg gets a great character-name here ( Vashti Blue ) and perhaps had an opportunity to really cut loose in a movie like she used to do on-stage in her pre - " Color Purple " days , but " The Telephone " is out-of-order ( to be charitable ) . Goldberg plays an actress with a pet owl ( ! ) who spends her time arguing on the horn . She's neurotic , but not funny . Director Rip Torn was apparently in way over his head ( didn't he do his homework and research Goldberg's style ? If so , he didn't use a smidgen of it here ) . There's nothing wrong with a plot less movie - - just so long as it provides something of interest , like , say , some good jokes . The screenplay ( by Harry Nilsson and Terry Southern , of all people ) doesn't even offer any promise . Whoopi's mere presence gives the movie an edge , but it's as shapeless and static a film as I've ever seen .
552812	989035	60848	1.0	" It doesn't make sense ! Not any of it ! "	Hilariously awful star-studded turkey , an apparent do-gooder drama concocted by Ian Fleming , sponsored by Xerox and directed by Bond-filmmaker Terence Young , details the United Nations ' efforts to stop the trafficking of opium out of the Middle East . Bungled ingredients include star-cameos , an introduction by Grace Kelly ( ! ) , and Yul Brynner ( misspelled in the credits ) as a fez-topped Colonel who rides out to meet his enemies on horseback as if this were a Samurai western . The curious , sloppy over-dubbing leaves some of the actors looking like foreigners in a spaghetti spy-drama , while Kelly implores us to remember that . . . yes . . . Poppy flowers are attractive and innocent-looking , but their seeds are producing drugs that are destroying our young people ! Not as fast as films like this . E . G . Marshall's somewhat bemused performance is the only asset the picture has to offer . Also known as " The Poppy Is Also a Flower " , " The Opium Connection " and ( my favorite ) " Danger Grows Wild " . NO STARS from
552646	989035	113729	1.0	Teen rubbish	Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse , along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance . I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence ( scored with an abominable rock song ) ; unfortunately , it does . Boy meets girl at school , they flirt , they date , they run off together . The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced . It isn't a fresh spin , although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new , and who knows ? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments . To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating , not to mention terribly irresponsible , and not quite the " wild and sexy adventure " advertised . NO STARS from
551111	989035	71607	1.0	The Disney people in desperation mode . . .	Although it was a hit with kids , this sequel to 1968's " The Love Bug " flounders around for some sort of inspiration , finding it only in the multiple flashbacks to the first picture . There's hardly a whiff of a plot , Helen Hayes looks uncomfortable , and Ken Berry is a poor man's Dean Jones . Worse , the special effects are shoddy , the production values cheap , and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director who practically prods you in the ribs . The Disney Company really lost more than their boss when Walt died ; they lost their direction , most especially in their live-action entertainment , relying on sequels and ( even today ) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding of what their founder was trying to do . " Herbie " is surely at that barrel's bottom .
551966	989035	443530	1.0	Queasy drama with a somewhat subversive premise . . .	Hapless 33-year-old gay man with only a few friends volunteers to take a new drug which promises to make him heterosexual . The trouble with this premise is , the central character ( inhibited and wounded ) would be unhappy in any sexual environment , either with a woman or another man . Writer-director John Baumgartner doesn't seem to take this into consideration , and so puts our hero into uncomfortable scenes such as the one where he gets intimate with a female co-worker ( who is seen as desperate and deluded ) . Low-budget and self-conscious , the picture doesn't even have the energy to hint at any intriguing ideas other than straight-vs . - gay . Baumgartner sees the casual indifference of the bar crowds and gives us a glimpse of the man's office job and his lonely life , but the main issue ( " What would life be like if I were straight ? " ) is too facile and obvious as a story-hook . Why not make the guy a bigot who is forced to take a gay pill ? The point made here is strictly a dead-end one , made even worse by one-dimensional people who don't merit much interest . from

Designed to make ladies swoon , but if they do they are easy targets . Completely toothless script is like a Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock reject , and Jennifer Lopez can't carry it off ; she sparkles , she twinkles , but it's a fairly transparent put-on . This just about scrapes bottom . from
552579	989035	252501	2.0	How come nobody called the cops on the bully with the bat ?	Infuriating story from a Stephen King book about elderly man with ESP ( Anthony Hopkins , in an easy , sly performance ) befriending young Bobby ( Anton Yelchin ) , the boy of a single mother who both live downstairs in the same building . William Goldman's mediocre screenplay pokes around , trying to come up with interesting details , but the whole thing is too belabored , with arty directorial flourishes adding nothing ( such as the slow-motion photography with Bobby and his friends playing in the river ) . The focus of the piece is so off that a bullying kid is not only revealed to be a cross-dresser ( huh ? ? ) , he gets away from criminal punishment with a good , stiff beating from vengeful Bobby , while good-hearted Hopkins gets hauled away ( again , huh ? ? ) . The picture doesn't even have the sense to tie its ends together at the finish-line , instead giving us a voice-over dripping with dulled-out sentimentality . from
552049	989035	60708	2.0	Expectations high , results poor	A spy satire from Joseph Losey ? Losey's films are always rich in texture but are completely alienating . His askewed vision - - usually defended by the intelligentsia set - - leaves viewers out of the mix , and one is left to ponder what the hell he was trying to say . " Modesty Blaise " is , sadly , no different . Loosely-structured ( to say the least ) , the plot has something to do with curvy thief-turned-secret agent protecting diamond shipment from a mama's boy villain . James Bond fanatics won't find much to bond with here : film's trick cuts and mod settings cannot detract from limply-staged , perplexing puzzle of a " comedy " . In the lead , Monica Vitti is an intriguing presence but she has no music in her voice ( in fact , she sounds dubbed ) . Director Losey was in way over his head here , and he drags everyone down with the ship . from
552489	989035	78504	2.0	Diana Ross as a spinster Dorothy ? ? Still , she's the only good thing in " The Wiz " . . .	Underwhelming black-rendering of " The Wizard Of Oz " , with Dorothy re-conceived as a Harlem schoolteacher without a man who learns the true meaning of happiness after she's whisked off to Oz ( which mostly looks like a Harlem playground ) . Sidney Lumet was probably the worst choice for a director of an all-black musical they could have gotten ; his heavy-handed touches , like having the Scarecrow crucified on a TV antennae , are excruciating throughout . Other seemingly good ideas , like casting Lena Horne as Glinda the Good Witch and Richard Pryor as The Wiz , don't come off either ( Horne responds to her role as if it were the Second Coming ) . Nearly everything here has been misjudged , and Lumet's timing is perpetually off . As for Diana Ross in the lead : she's too young to be convincing as an old maid schoolteacher ( and dressing La Ross down was a fundamental mistake ; who wants a spinsterish Dorothy ? ) . However , Ross has made glitter out of garbage before and she works hard at the poorly-written dialogue . But Lumet has her crying all the time , and whining about wanting to go home . Someone should have simply directed Dorothy down the block , it certainly doesn't look as if she traveled all that far . from
551055	989035	112642	3.0	" Beetlejuice " wanna-be . . .	An unfortunate waste of a potentially good opportunity : a pilferation of the Harvey Comics staple about a friendly ghost looking for friends , and the loner teen and her father who take up residence in the mansion haunted by Casper and other apparitions of the boo-and-cackle variety . As Roger Ebert pointed out at the time , it was completely wrong-headed of the screenwriters to delve into the history of Casper ( revealed to be the ghost of a dead child ! ) , which renders some of the wild , gross-out slapstick completely inappropriate . Sloppily-directed in the " Beetlejuice " vein by Brad Silberling , who is no Tim Burton . The production is slick and expensive , but the hammy material is broad and derivative , defeating leads Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci as well as cameo-players Dan Aykroyd and Rodney Dangerfield , among others . Under 10-year-olds probably won't notice . from
550580	989035	190590	3.0	Handsome production , but awkward , detached serio-comedy isn't too funny . . .	Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached , occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen . Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune , and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process ! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum . It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic , Gableesque mugging , and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music . Otherwise , the screenplay ( by the Coens ) is seriously lacking in humor and interest , supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift , and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence . from
550965	989035	78869	3.0	" Star Wars " sent every major studio into the space-age ; think of this as Exhibit A . . .	Attempt by the Disney Studios to partake in the newest rage , science fiction , was hotly anticipated in 1979 , but the results are much closer to " 20000 Leagues Under the Sea " than to " Star Wars " . A Captain Nemo-like misfit , obsessed with black holes ( vortexes in space with incredible suction ) , risks his life and those of his space-exploration team when he decides to intentionally venture into a black hole with his spacecraft . Plodding direction , pedestrian script , and lackluster performances from a B-list group keeps this adventure in the cosmos firmly planted on the ground . The special effects are the only aspect of the film worth praising , and even those aren't quite what you're hoping for from the Disney people . from
550602	989035	59930	3.0	Artistic handling , good cast , but a fatigued melodrama . . .	The life story of Dublin playwright Sean O'Casey ( here called Johnny Cassidy ! ) has a sweeping , arty direction by Jack Cardiff , with assistance from John Ford , but it is full of characters who fail to come to life despite a sterling cast of players . Adapted from O'Casey's autobiography " Mirror in My House " , film is saddled with too much melodrama and sideline romances . The location filming is excellent , and Maggie Smith gives a standout performance as a spinster bookseller , but there's not enough heart in the handling . In the lead , Rod Taylor brings his rugged handsomeness to the screen but little else . from
552169	989035	59724	3.0	Situation peculiar . . . but not hopeless	Two American soldiers stationed in Germany during World War II are captured by an odd German shopkeeper ( Alec Guinness ) ; he imprisons the two men in his basement and keeps them there long after the war is over . Strange , unhappy , insecure comedy-drama is extremely well-cast but is really too creepy to laugh at . As the soldiers , Michael Connors and Robert Redford have some good moments , but one can't help but feeling this is just an actors ' exercise for both ( they're green , but commendable ) . Alec Guinness is forced to walk a fine line in his characterization ; it's imperative to the story that we don't hate the shopkeeper , and Guinness works hard at finding nuances in the man to keep him complex and interesting . If newcomers Connors and Redford are young actors just finding their way , then Guinness is in the Master's class . from
552588	989035	103069	3.0	One miscalculation after another	Director Peter Bogdanovich's failed follow-up to his critical breakthrough film , 1971's " The Last Picture Show " , returns to small town Texas to catch up on the lives of those once-compelling characters . Bogdanovich , who - - in a replay of the first film - - also adapted Larry McMurtry's novel , is now too jaded to see much joy or dramatic irony in these surroundings , and the sterling cast he has assembled just seems disheartened . The plot , a rumination of Jeff Bridges ' Duane Jackson ( who is now an unhappily married oil-man dissatisfied with his job and life ) , doesn't built any momentum , emotional , dramatic or otherwise , and the director follows a botched pattern : one flabby , talky sequence after another . from
553159	989035	367594	3.0	Begins wonderfully . . . but the fun dissipates inside the factory , and Depp is a disappointment	Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's classic children's book , previously filmed with music in 1971 as " Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory " , opens with great promise , featuring incredible art direction that mixes German Expressionism with Grimm-like fantasy ( aided by Danny Elfman's atmospheric , if familiar , score ) . Charlie Bucket , a child of little privilege who lives with his family in a lopsided house , longs to be one of five lucky worldwide recipients of a prized Golden Ticket , an invitation to tour the candy factory of reclusive genius Willy Wonka . Burton mounts the excitement of the treasure hunt , with the tickets hidden in Wonka candy bars , with gleeful aplomb , and the satire - - though a bit heavy-handed - - is both trendy and amusing . Once the action moves to Wonka's foreboding factory however , and Johnny Depp takes center stage as Wonka ( a would-be misplaced child of the sixties ) , interest wanes . All the kids and parents are well-cast , particularly Freddie Highmore as Charlie and David Kelly as his Grandpa Joe , but the computer-generated effects turn Wonka's landscape into an impenetrable den of ugly colors and outsized objects ( like moving wallpaper ) . Burton , who expressed nothing but contempt for the previous version , does borrow pieces from that film , improving upon some areas ( such as Veruca Salt's exit , with squirrels instead of geese ) but falling far short on others ( when Grandpa Joe and Charlie secretly unwrap a Wonka bar at night and come up empty , there's no camaraderie between the two , and no embracing of the familial theme ) . The musical Oompa-Loompas are a dreadful come-down from the predecessor , with songs sung in different musical styles and Burton staging each like a music video ( these sequences , too , steal from the first film , yet the Oompa's message ultimately gets lost in the silliness ) . Depp performs with too much grotesque caricature ; sure , his Wonka is out of step with the world , but his sarcasm is too modern , and is geared to get easy laughs from the audience . Screenwriter John August is more out of touch than Wonka ; using nasty put-downs to separate Charlie from the other kids is a facile and lazy way of telegraphing us that these children are bad examples , and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood ( as well as a visual history of the Oompa-Loompas ) does absolutely nothing but chew up time on the clock . We first see Wonka himself in a flashback based on a story from Grandpa Joe ( didn't Charlie know that his grandfather once worked for Willy Wonka ? ) , making Wonka's official entrance several minutes later a non-event . This story is difficult to film without getting gummy or preachy , but Burton was on the right track with his opening sequences . Too bad the second-half is so misbegotten ( and not even ambitious , really ) that all the mystery drains away like melted chocolate . from
553189	989035	59094	3.0	Fussy , annoying family comedy ; ersatz Disney without the car chase . . .	John Haase's novel " Erasmus With Freckles " gets a woebegone Hollywood makeover and , while it may look promising at the outset , it turns out to be one of the weakest films James Stewart ever starred in . Young Billy Mumy , a mathematical genius , spends all of his spare time writing juvenile love letters to French film actress Brigitte Bardot ( though it isn't mentioned just how many of her pictures he has actually been allowed to see ) . Eventually , dad Stewart gets Mumy an audience with the siren ( whose brief appearance is the only bright spot here ) . Movies about unconventional family broods have to include more than just hectic , noisy silliness to keep our attention ; this adaptation doesn't even try for a sense of eccentricity in the content of character , nor does it expand on the central child's personality . It's meant to be heart-warming , non-threatening fun , yet it borders dangerously on bland , with nary a single funny scene . from
552296	989035	58529	3.0	The Rat Pack in Sherwood Forest ?	. . . no , but that might have made a more interesting picture than this . It's Prohibition-era Chicago , and Frank Sinatra coasts indifferently through his role as a gangster in 1928 trying to stay one step ahead of the law , aided by his faithful cronies . Sappy semi-musical doesn't even look good ! It's a poor excuse to get the gang together . Sinatra , Dean Martin and Sammy Davis , Jr . are joined this time by Bing Crosby , Edward G . Robinson , and - - in the proverbial pretty girl role - - Barbara Rush . Yet everyone here seems to be either distracted or suffering from a bad case of the blues , particularly Ol ' Blue Eyes , who looks wrung-out . The film's only kick comes in seeing Crosby and Sinatra reunited from " High Society " , and by Peter Falk doing lively work in a dim part . from
553185	989035	43983	4.0	" This is a pretty box of pickles ! "	American brother and sister song-and-dance act sets sail for England after their manager gets them a London booking on the eve of Princess Elizabeth's royal nuptials . Stereotypical Brits litter the phony , contrived scenario ( one waits - - not in vain - - for the first " Jolly good show ! " or the proverbial walk in the fog ) . In the leads , Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are a perky , polite sibling pair ; she puts her Yankee beaus on hold to be romanced by a bird-chasing Lord ( Peter Lawford , as British a Lord as M-G-M could buy ) while Fred fancies Sarah Churchill , a performer whose idea of romance is to dance on the ceiling ( cue the next musical number ! ) . Astaire dances ( very well ) and acts ( not so well ) , while Jane hits the high notes . It's rather a dismaying picture without a single good song . Even Mr . Astaire's solo numbers look like flagrant chapter stops in the bland action . from

Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter , but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional ! Atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way . Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time ( with psychological overtones ) , yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive ; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for TV's late-late show . Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional , though Patty Duke ( playing a cute brat pre - " Miracle Worker " ) gets a colorful , memorable exit . from
553072	989035	105017	4.0	Slapstick theatre hit congeals on the screen . . .	Movie-adaptation of the British stage farce by Michael Frayn about the comic foibles and headaches derailing a stage production . Lots of pratfalls and double-takes courtesy director Peter Bogdanovich , whose love for this material is apparent despite a stop-and-go execution which doesn't always run smoothly . The cast , including Carol Burnett , Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve , is inclined to mug shamelessly - - as if the only way to sell this broadly-drawn ballet is to put it way over-the-top . May be funny if it strikes you in the proper silly spirit , but the casting is more interesting than the characters the actors are playing , and interest wanes fairly quickly . from
553141	989035	70599	4.0	Terrific actors sunk by desultory , obtuse plotting and a draggy pace . . .	Sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit , asking for a divorce . Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A . Fraker , this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in : each shot is composed for the utmost style , but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight , gripping narrative . Fraker ( and his cinematographer , László Kovács ) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones , giving the picture a burnished , tableaux feel . The mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor , and Fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral . Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman ( as Shaw's fiancée ) , two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s , manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing ( which turns their scenes into little bits of half-realized business ) . Sondra Locke , another interesting screen personality , seems cast for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in " Repulsion " . Pale and saucer-eyed , with imposingly thick and long hair , Locke is a curious human puzzle , and she's initially quite intimidating and dangerous ; however , this role is so old-hat that Locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze , and she flounders . Fraker allows Locke's freak-out scenes to go on and on , while Shaw ( looking terrifically debonair ) is put in the impossible position of playing touchy-feely daddy to her . All of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility ( or , at the very least , some dry wit or humorous relief ) . As it is , Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume's limp script , adapted from Stanton Forbes ' novel " Go To Thy Deathbed " , strands the viewer early on , and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line . from
551998	989035	95613	4.0	Doesn't leave behind any good memories . . .	Billy Crystal co-wrote , co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons , adult irresponsibility , and growing old . Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack ( ha ha ) which causes him to seek out his estranged father ( Alan King ) , a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star . The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners galore , a flat , inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler ( stuck in sitcom mode ) , and family-conflict at the ready . Crystal and King try their best , but King is over-eager and frequently over-the-top . JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles , but manages to bring her innate , down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character . It's a comedy , I guess , but one that blinks back the tears . . . shamefully . from

Feisty female turns rancher in this feminist western , butting heads with the local-yokels in a distaff variation on " The Sheepman " . Doris doesn't look her best here ( blame it on that wig ) , although her conniption fits are as funny as ever . When Day gets her ire up , it's really something to behold . But the film is unbelievably anachronistic , especially since this was 1967 . No wonder she later turned to TV ; this plays like a failed TV pilot , with a supporting cast to match !

It features Richard Widmark in a humiliating ' comedic ' role as a man whose wife can't get pregnant , leading him into a drunken excursion with a sexy adoption agent , whom he later believes he has knocked up . Widmark is not suited to this material , which should be played nimbly and without force . Director Gene Kelly , of all people , is likewise not suited to guide an intense actor like Widmark through the rigors of light comedy ( which can be more precarious than a gangster drama ) . Doris Day is the put-upon wife , and I felt for her . Even with a feeble script and dim handling , Day manages a ray of sunshine or two . Gig Young , in the patented Gig Young / friendly neighbor role , helps out a little bit , but " The Tunnel Of Love " is a frigid affair . from

The downside is , smart girls never get the guys - - although a Mark Ruffalo lookalike who works at the rink just loves Trachtenberg's scientific babbling . Disney film for young girls hasn't a whiff of originality , with a bland sense of humor and snotty , slangy Lolita wanna-bes on the ice . As Trachtenberg's mom , Joan Cusack acts like she's ready for the Motion Picture Retirement Home , however Kim Cattrall's work as the hard-nosed skating coach isn't bad until the character is turned into a formula cutthroat .

Fiesty Brit Maureen O'Hara and daughter Juliet Mills bring a royal bull for breeding to Old West America , where both ladies wind up with suitors . Capable cast holds interest but , despite some pleasurable moments , Andrew V . McLaglen's perplexing direction is way over-the-top . The screenplay by Ric Hardman keeps all the characters spouting off and hopping mad , turning the movie into a western parody ( culminating in a laughable blizzard sequence which McLaglen stages on a set - - with the results looking far worse than the typical blue-screen effect ) . O'Hara juggles the affections of both James Stewart ( completely rote ) and Brian Keith ( hamming with abandon as a wild-eyed Scotsman ) . She was better off with the bull . from

Keanu Reeves is typically one-note as a computer-hacking loner who finds his life may not be reality - - and that an alternate reality introduced to him by guru Laurence Fishburne could destroy him . Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers , who seem to enjoy a twisting story - - though at the expense of logic ( forget credibility ) . A more engaging leading man might have made the technical asides easier to wade through , although most audiences didn't seem to mind . Followed by " The Matrix Reloaded " and " The Matrix Revolutions " , both in 2003 . from
551170	989035	60283	4.0	The Rankin / Bass team working with the best of intentions . . .	Despite a terrific " Emperor's New Clothes " episode , I'm hard-pressed to recall anything in " The Daydreamer " which really works , and that's a shame because the team of Rankin / Bass is obviously working with love and sincerity . Plot concerns a young Hans Christian Andersen who runs away from home and meets up with all the fairy tale characters he'll someday write about . Live-action prologue and epilogue are cringingly awkward , animated middle not nearly as bad but certainly not magical . Top vocal talents abound , but they're weakly used ( Hayley Mills voices the Little Mermaid , but when it's Hayley's turn to sing , we are instead treated to some kiddie variation on Marni Nixon ) . Best segment is " The Emperor's New Clothes " , which is paced better than the rest of the film and is certainly helped by Ed Wynn as the delightfully egomaniacal Emperor . from
551212	989035	79285	4.0	Farrah's leading men : Kirk , Harvey , and a horny robot named Hector	Would-be foreboding sci-fi looks all shiny and new , like a futuristic department store . Three good actors ( Farrah Fawcett , Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel ) come off looking like incompetent dummies in this derivative , cardboard cartoon . When Keitel arrives at the space station of lovers Douglas and Fawcett , he is carrying a strange metal container . Douglas offers to carry it for him and Keitel answers , " NOOOOOOOO ! " in a hilariously chilly manner that makes even Richard Burton's overacting seem tame by comparison . Poor Kirk and Farrah even strip down for this one ( so much for the classy reputation of vet director Stanley Donen ) . There is a neat scene where robotic Hector takes a splinter from Farrah's eye , but her reaction afterward ( rubbing it like a child and sticking her bottom lip out ) is embarrassing . This is one step beyond , all right . It's so far out it's brain-dead . from
552611	989035	78952	4.0	The best of Marsha Mason and the worst of Neil Simon	This agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 . I remember opening the movie-section of the L . A . Times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for " Chapter Two " filled with glowing captions like : " Better than ' The Goodbye Girl ' ! " and " Neil Simon does it again ! " What does Neil Simon do ? He takes an autobiographical situation ( remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse ) and makes it rusty , unpleasant and - - worst of all - - unfunny . James Caan plays Neil - - er . . that is , George - - a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife ; enter spirited Marsha Mason ( real-life Mrs . Simon . . . soon to be ex-Mrs . Simon ) who attempts to love George despite his moods and general melancholy . Mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for Caan's indifference ( not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin , blonde Valerie Harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt ) . I liked Mason's outburst at the end ( " I am wonderful ! I am NUTS about me ! " ) , but I saw no happy ending for these two people . . . and time proved me right . from
550828	989035	86643	4.0	A remastered mess	David Bowie , on stage at London's Hammersmith Odeon ( circa 1973 ) performing under the guise of his alter-ego , the androgynous space alien Ziggy Stardust . Bowie now claims Ziggy was not his bow to transvestism but rather his way of bucking the system ; that's all well and good , but seeing D . B . in space-drag may make you think otherwise . He looks frequently ridiculous in these dated get-ups , and director D . A . Pennebaker gives Bowie no mystery or ambience ( he shoots straight-on without frills , probably the obstacle of teeny-tiny budget ) . Why remaster something of the ' point the camera and shoot ' variety of filmmaking ? Well , it's the 30th Anniversary of the album " The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust " , so they exhumed this from the mothballs to capitalize on the hype . Yes , the music here is exciting and maybe even titillating , but it'll be even better on your CD player . from
551456	989035	120863	4.0	Tiresome meditation	Reclusive director Terence Malick's first film in YEARS is a heavy-going vision of hellish war ( I resist using the term " epic " since Malick's interpretation of mortal combat is frequently rather puny ; he's better at quiet moments of contemplation than dealing with actors in volatile situations ) . Malick seems just about the worst director you could get to film a war movie , but his heart was in the right place I suppose , and - - as it turned out - - much of Hollywood's male A-list was anxious to work with him ( more people must have seen " Days of Heaven " than we thought ! ) . This visit to Guadacanal during WWII is indeed hellish for a group of young soldiers , but their personalities don't really take shape - - nor are they particularly likable or interesting ( and it's tough to tell from Malick's usual soft-sell if this was intentional ) . Soldier Woody Harrelson , just after much of his torso is destroyed by a grenade , complains of never being able to fk again . This tips us off that Malick is contemplative of war as a macho , heterosexual experience , and the bitterness of this scene lingers longer than any of Malick's other intentions . Solemn film is full of dreamy remembrances and intense close-ups of handsome Hollywood faces , but these cameos throw off the film's mood , turning it into an old-fashioned foray ( recalling " A Bridge Too Far " ) . Nick Nolte is simply tiresome as an officer on the verge of hysteria , though both Sean Penn and Elias Koteas come up with interesting characterizations . Otherwise , it's a mess . from
551405	989035	59496	4.0	Not a thriller - - and not much as a drama - - it has almost nil appeal . . .	Evelyn Piper's novel becomes another Bette Davis vehicle made in the wake of Davis ' second-act success starring in creepy melodramas ; unfortunately , the tools are not present in Piper's material for Miss Davis to make a grand show of it , and the film version seems strictly bush-league as a result . Prim English governess may or may not be responsible for the drowning death of a young child . Potentially intriguing scenario never livens up , and director Seth Holt restrains Bette to the point of her seeming catatonic . Hammer Films production is overwhelmingly gloomy , not scary , and the supporting players are of little help . Colorless and largely forgettable . from
551134	989035	166485	4.0	Ready-made star-crossed tale	Although I found this version of the story more palpable than the musical " The King And I " , which was so stagy and heavy it felt like a pound cake soaking wet , I still can't understand why this is such a beloved story . It has a musty , old-fashioned theme - - which is constructed here like a connect-the-dots book - - and I quickly found myself impatient with the scenario and all the people in it . Jodie Foster ( far less flexible than she's capable of being ) is uncomfortable using a British accent , and her romantic rapport with Chow Yun Fat is mild , to be charitable ( they'd make great buddies ) . Events in the film can practically be checked off a list ; and when violence erupts near the finale , it's neither gripping nor exciting , just painfully slack . from
553053	989035	89945	4.0	" Blazing Saddles " on Valium	Writer-director High Wilson must have been a big admirer of those gentle , low-keyed western serials from the ' 30s and ' 40s , but how he managed to sell this homage in the mid-1980s is a mystery . Deliberately mild outdoor yarn features Tom Berenger as a singing cowboy and Andy Griffith as a corrupt sheriff . Both actors are nicely cast with tongue-in-cheek , but the movie's anachronistic handling is a prolonged in-joke which ultimately leaves the viewer shut off from the humor . The plotting is incidental and slim , and the affection Wilson has for the lead character is translated too coyly . Almost completely inoffensive , it's a picture that barely lingers in the memory . from
551031	989035	110649	4.0	Satire of Hollywood phonies - - by phonies	Michael Tolkin impressed me so much with his film " The Rapture " that it was certainly depressing to then see his talents go to waste with this absurd comedy of lost morals . A graphic designer and her Hollywood honcho husband are in big financial trouble : she has no clients and he just quit his job . Some of their solutions are quirky and interesting , but the characters are off-base right from the start . Tolkin is the new Sidney Lumet : everyone screams irrationally at everyone , but it's tough to discern whether or not we're supposed to laugh at their banal verbal matches - - from opposite ends of their swimming pool ! In the leads ( another problem ) , Judy Davis and Peter Weller can't work up any semblance of chemistry , or to even convince us they're a high-powered married couple . A few of their marital predicaments are worked out amusingly ( they separate within the house , and date others ) , but their jealousies and insecurities are a bore . Tolkin ( the screenwriter of " The Player " ) pretends to know these people . He's pseudo-hip . It would be to his ultimate advantage if he broadened his horizons . . . or maybe made some new friends . from
553627	989035	89892	4.0	" Chained Heat " revisited	Women-in-prison flick involving an innocent American tourist in West Germany who is mistaken for a spy , grilled until exhaustion sets in , and sent to jail without a word to her soldier-fiancé . After publicly nixing her hit " Chained Heat " on just about every talk show of the 1980s , it's amazing that star Linda Blair would even think of doing another jailhouse underachiever . This one , filmed in chilly blues and grays , is just as seedy and depressing . The roster comes complete with a decadently lascivious guard ( gaunt , kinky Sylvia Kristel ) , a terrified blonde , a friendly butch , and lots of malicious broads . And yet the direction is fairly tight , the locales are interesting , and the movie is engrossing almost in spite of itself . As for Blair , she keeps her dignity and has a few strong scenes , including being interrogated and collapsing under the pressure or standing up to the review board with a firm " f you ! " from
553309	989035	78158	5.0	Good cast and interesting teenage characters sacrificed for yahoo thrills . . .	Disney's sequel to their not-bad 1975 hit " Escape To Witch Mountain " brings back Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards as the teen-tykes from outer space , here battling wits and powers with villainous Bette Davis and Christopher Lee ( and their chauffeur , Anthony James , who also played a chauffeur alongside Davis in " Burnt Offerings " ! ) . Well-enough made , but the movie loses sight of what was so special about the first film ( a kid's flick with the emphasis on character , not overtly outlandish special effects ) . Davis is alert and anxious , but she's practically smothered under the gaudy make-up and is left to chew the scenery without benefit of a strong script . Poor Christopher Lee has it even worse , blending into the foreground action while the kids steal all his scenes . The plotting gets too heavy in the final third , what with Los Angeles about to be decimated and delinquent children running amok , but the worst decision was to separate siblings Tony and Tia for much of the movie . Some good sequences , Jack Soo does nice work in a warm supporting bit , and a goat nearly saves the day ( and gets a big " thank you " to boot ! ) . from
551174	989035	87799	5.0	Lively , sloppy Valley girl sci-fi . . .	Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney are exceptionally cute as cynical California siblings from the Valley who survive the nuclear holocaust and spend the rest of the movie fending off radioactive mutants . Mary Woronov , always a great presence in B-flicks like this , is unfortunately stuck in the draggy sub-plot about brain-dead scientists , and the film's sloppy continuity and muddy cinematography are poor , yet the two girls are wisecracking fun . The movie , lively and silly , adopts a rather enjoyable slant on the marauding zombie genre , sending up the precarious scenario - - the end of civilization as we know it - - in such a campy , overtly-dumb fashion that it couldn't possibly be disturbing ( except perhaps to science-fiction devotees , who will most likely just laugh it off ) . from
552213	989035	61052	5.0	Bumping and grinding to a halt . . .	Ann-Margret alternates between come-hither pussycat and uptight do-gooder playing a would-be writer who attempts to pass herself off as sexually depraved in order to get a deal with a sleazy men's magazine . The problem with this picture is the very same predicament Annie faces : it's a square piece of goods palming itself off as naughty . The opening montage of sex-clubs is amusing , and A-M is energetic bouncing around on a trampoline , but the movie is talky , draggy , and seemingly produced on the cheap . Tony Franciosa doesn't work very well with Ann-Margret ( he squirms too much , which isn't good for the romantic sub-plot ) . A few clever gimmicks - - like the teaser ending , which caught me off guard - - and Ann-Margret's shapely figure compensate , but " The Swinger " just doesn't swing . Perhaps a director with a sharper flair for visual slapstick and satire ( like Frank Tashlin ) may have brought out a more cartoony sensibility to these proceedings . George Sidney certainly tries , but he's too literal for the flighty material ; while staging a mock-orgy , he has Ann-Margret writhing around on the floor slathered in paint . . . wouldn't straight sex be cleaner ? from
550876	989035	70068	5.0	Plush , but pallid romantic drama . . .	As a 40-ish divorcée courting a 22-year-old man , Liv Ullmann ( beautiful Swedish actress in only her second American film ) looks like a deer caught in the headlights . She's much too shaky and insecure to warm up to , and her scenes with Edward Albert have no romantic lift ( this isn't all Liv's fault , Albert pushes his moments with her in a creepy way , coming off like an overripe gigolo ) . The good supporting cast includes Binnie Barnes and Deborah Raffin ; Gene Kelly is lively playing Liv's ex-husband , although he is forced to go-go dance ( such were the times ) . A wan , somewhat exhausted piece of fluff from the play by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy . from
552583	989035	104452	5.0	Screwball outing from Frank Oz could use some extra screws . . .	An architect has a fling with a sexy waitress who turns out to be a con-artist ; she insinuates herself into his life and home and passes herself off as his wife to visitors . Relatively painless , genial comedy from director Frank Oz is sort of the comedic flip-side to " Fatal Attraction " - - though the way Goldie Hawn plays the con-woman , she's more of a kooky flake than a comedy threat . Still , Steve Martin puts up with her for the sake of the plot , which is just an idea stretched to feature length . The more sobering moments of the third act seem to come out of nowhere ; while a little dramatic subtext is surely substantial , I'm not quite certain how seriously Oz and his actors are actually taking it - - or , for that matter , how seriously they want audiences to respond . from
551713	989035	78449	5.0	Glossy H-wood garbage . . . a gossip-column turned teleplay !	Jaclyn Smith is a decent actress ; with no real acting experience at the time Aaron Spelling put her in " Charlie's Angels " , she never embarrassed herself on that show ( especially the early episodes where she actually showed some spunk ) . Unfortunately , no one has been able to tap that sassy side of her since . She has played all different types of characters , but the only TV-movie she's made that left an indelible impression on me was " Rage Of Angels " , a decent potboiler with Smith doing work . " The Users " presents her as a muse to a faded Hollywood hack , climbing the ladder of celebrity herself only to find Lotus Land full of backbiters . Is any of this new ? No . It is enjoyable anyway ? Occasionally , yes . It's a melodramatic soap opera with tatty , now-dated trappings . I didn't much mind the television budget or the sudsy dialogue . I did , however , want to see Jaclyn Smith give a stronger performance . When will Aaron Spelling work his magic on her again ?
551962	989035	95800	5.0	A few lovely sequences do not make it a classic . . .	Well-received French film from James Oliver Curwood's book harks back to the wildlife documentaries from 1950s Disney in both style and sentiment , as an orphaned bear cub trails a Kodiak bear around a mountain terrain for companionship . Soon , they're both being followed by an eager pack of hunters . " The Bear " features several eloquent and lovely moments , captured beautifully on film by director Jean-Jacques Annaud , though unfortunately the film as a whole isn't especially worthwhile . The animals are manipulated into action for the sake of thrills , some of which have a brutal edge , leaving an uncomfortable pall hanging over the project . Ultimately , it's an old-fashioned adventure story with a sincere appreciation for the bears involved , yet it doesn't leave one feeling very satisfied . from
552816	989035	71442	5.0	Fascinatingly terrible . . .	It would be tempting to write " The Driver's Seat " off as one of the worst movies ever , but it's rather seductive on a slim budget . . . fascinating in its wrong-headedness . The film has such a loopy , surreal quality , and star Elizabeth Taylor is actually attempting something ( rather than just posing ) , that the weirdness of the entire enterprise becomes compelling . Filmed in Italy , the story concerns a highly troubled , manic woman on the hunt for the perfect man . . . to be her murderer ? Incoherent for the most part , though perhaps that's what keeps you watching . Taylor is all dolled up , but she doesn't look her best here - - and one can only wonder what she made of this verbose script and her odd , underwritten character . Still in all , I watched to the very end , and I have to say the bizarre finale ( with all those chairs ) struck me as original , and stylish in a tacky way . Most bad films are boring or uninspired ; " The Driver's Seat " is bad , but not for these reasons . It has a certain movie-making fever , but it's been put together by unconventional - - dare I say it ? - - talents who have little idea how to construct and mount a film . from
551284	989035	44919	5.0	It's Belle S . vs . those dirty Daltons !	Here's an odd one : sexy Jane Russell as western sharp-shooter Belle Starr , here competing with rivals The Dalton Gang . Movie opens with fruity bravado , but don't expect a camp-fest . Things gets surprisingly serious in the film's second-half , leading to a curiously downbeat conclusion . Very strange , and not particularly successful . Worth a look for the curio value alone . Supporting players George Brent and Forrest Tucker take turns getting out of Jane's way ; Russell poses , pouts and scowls as Belle , her high-point coming in a crowded saloon where she warbles " The Gilded Lily " . from
553207	989035	44762	5.0	Bud and Lou are Off to See the Giant . . .	The often-told fable gets amusingly tweaked with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in the leads , singing , dancing , and messing with a really nasty ogre . Opening in sepia tone , Bud and Lou somehow walk into a job as babysitters for a problem child ; Lou wants a bedtime story read to him , quickly falling asleep and dreaming he and his mother live in a colorful storybook village , growing a magical beanstalk and attempting to rescue a kidnapped princess from a giant . Devised and co-produced by Lou's brother , Pat , this was an independently-financed production from the comedy duo which Warner Bros . distributed . It has some kooky songs and even kookier sequences ( such as a masochistic Minuet between Lou and the giant's equally lanky female cook ) , but it does appear as a paste-up job . Filmed in just over three weeks , some of the scenes are so sloppy , one doesn't know if they were hastily left that way or if the clumsiness was perhaps intentional ( the editing , too , is awful , leaving the cook and her cow behind in fantasy limbo ) . The sets , leftovers from Ingrid Bergman's " Joan of Arc " , are fine , but the costumes are atrocious - - hopefully , this venture scared Costello away from tights for the remainder of his life ! It's kinda cute in a bumbling , ramshackle sort of way , and Lou gets a lot of funny business to do , but it isn't as imaginative as it should have been . from
553476	989035	114131	5.0	Unreleased theatrical feature is quirky but has no punch	Josh Charles is wonderful as a young man obsessed with . . . traffic ? He longs to be a traffic reporter in the sky , but first finds on-again / off-again love with a perplexing Anne Heche ( she's so flaky he can't get a grip on her , and neither can we ) . John Goodman has a funny supporting role , and the production values are first-rate , but this is short-film material stretched out far too long . Terrific cast includes Dey Young , Christine Lahti , and Brent Spiner , but each has very little to do , and the film is flattened out by an overall lack of imagination and by its length . More cleverness was obviously needed ; there's not enough substance here for the picture to stay the course . from
551281	989035	44557	5.0	" You'll have nice things , Nell , you're a handsome woman ! "	Unintentionally funny B-movie from Fox was Marilyn Monroe's first starring role ( a year before " Niagra " ) ; she plays a delusional , pathetic young woman just out of a mental institution who ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple's child one night in a posh New York hotel . Richard Widmark takes a shine to her , until he realizes she's " satin on one side and sandpaper on the other ! " Widmark's ex-girlfriend Anne Bancroft - - making a decent film debut - - has some funny lines too ( to Widmark : " I'm not angry - - I'm only furious ! " ) . Pulpy concoction , weak on action , has a few strong scenes : Monroe flirting with Widmark using the hotel window blinds , Monroe's final ride in the elevator , and any scene with Jim Backus as the kid's father . The director allows Marilyn to get away with too much , and when her eyes fire up with deranged hatred , she's really something to behold - - but in an amusing way that does this not-too-suspenseful melodrama no favors . from
553683	989035	120857	5.0	It seldom finds the appropriate flavor . . .	Young boy from a broken home is ' adopted ' by a group of elderly British women in pre-WWII Florence , Italy . Director Franco Zeffirelli's rather self-conscious valentine to his own childhood is slushed with poetic sentimentality , most of which feels distinctly artificial . The young lad at the heart of the piece isn't at all memorable , and the ladies unfortunately fare no better ( but where else can you find Cher , Judi Dench , Joan Plowright , Lily Tomlin and Maggie Smith together on-screen ? ) . Some of the more subtle moments ( such as the child waiting for someone to pick him up after school ) touch on a velvety kind of youthful longing that is rather sweet , but the drippy dialogue and obvious " scene stealing " opportunities for the femme stars drain much of the sincerity from the mix . from
551647	989035	59661	5.0	Cheeky western romp . . .	Burt Kennedy adapted Max Evans ' book and directed this utterly unassuming , pleasant time-filler which keeps tongue-in-cheek and deep thoughts in neutral . Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda play two horse-tamers in Arizona who bond with a bucking roan horse ; Sue Ane Langdon and Hope Holiday are two tootsies they tangle with . Sleeper hit from 1965 offers Glenn Ford more room to shine than his co-star ; Fonda is so non-aggressive and laid-back , it's easy to forget that he's around . Overall , Kennedy's approach is a bit mundane , and the picture doesn't have a big impact , but the scenery is certainly nice and the ladies - - in and out of their clothes - - are lively . from
551748	989035	114214	5.0	Intentionally over-the-top , but flimsy instead of full-bodied . . .	Flashy but flimsy western tries for fantasy-mythic feel but never quite achieves its ambitions . Sharon Stone plays mysterious lady gunslinger who signs up for dueling contest in a tumbleweed town once she discovers her mortal nemesis is involved , the mangy varmint who was instrumental in killing her sheriff father . Spirited , but shallow , artistically-wayward western with tongue-in-cheek . It has some silly flash and sass , but it isn't involving , nor do any of the players ( a jaw-dropper of a cast which includes Gene Hackman , Russell Crowe , Leonardo DiCaprio , and Gary Sinise ) come off looking especially good . Director Sam Raimi sets up some visually amazing shots - - but without honest , gritty characters , it's not much more than a live-action cartoon . Stone is flippant and sexy , but she's just relying on her proved shtick and it quickly wears thin . from
552053	989035	95088	5.0	TV sitcom masquerading as a feature film	Elvira ( Cassandra Peterson ) is a very chipper presence on the screen , but her dry comments and costumed-Valley Girl disposition can't carry a movie very far . The plot - - something to do with an inheritance , a book of spells , and Edie McClurg as a Mrs . Kravitz-type townsperson - - isn't painful or slack , but it is extremely slight . . . and the horny teenage boys who keep trying to get a peek at Elvira's bazooms are like refugees from " Porky's 3 " . There's also a hunky love-interest for Elvira , but he doesn't seem especially like the type of guy she would go for ( since when do ghouls get worked up over all-American beefcake ? ) . It all leads to an FX-induced showdown and a finale in Las Vegas , but the real laugh-getter is Elvira and she's funny when she gets the chance . from

Du Maurier's novel " Trilby " , first filmed as " Svengali " in 1931 with John Barrymore and Marian Marsh , gets an embarrassing ' 80s make-over here , with New York bar-band singer Jodie Foster discovered and sent to vocal extraordinaire Peter O'Toole for refinement . They share a begrudging relationship at first , accented by ego-mad Svengali O'Toole's stormy temperament , until Foster's Zoe eventually lands a record deal - - putting into question her need to rely on this man who has come to be her mentor and love-interest . Well-produced for television , the movie gets off to a good start but eventually flags , with Foster unconvincing as a vocalist and O'Toole looking ragged and disinterested . There's a funny bit performance by a young Holly Hunter ( whose screws are so loose , she clashes with the relatively somber tone of this piece ) , and Elizabeth Ashley has some fine moments near the beginning before she is unceremoniously lost in the shuffle .
552239	989035	350258	5.0	Is it a great performance or a great impersonation ?	Director Taylor Hackford doesn't have to work hard to get Ray Charles on our side : the opening scene , with Ray outsmarting a bigoted redneck , gets you smiling and immediately we're off on Ray's adventure . It seems like a good start , but despite the fact that Ray is a sympathetic , interesting character on-screen , it's tough to believe much of what we're seeing is real ( and that's because it follows a tried-and-true Hollywood formula , right down to showing us headlines to push the narrative forward ) . The production is very handsome , the supporting characters fairly well drawn , and Jamie Foxx is solid and commendable . Is he really feeling Ray Charles down to his marrow or is this just a terrific Ray Charles impersonation ? Hard to tell from the way this half-fabricated story plays out : it's a slick , assembly-line bio-pic . Fun for one viewing but no masterwork . from

Lots of " drag " jokes and vocal hamming from Eddie Murphy ( as a tiny dragon ) may make kids giggle , but this is far from the studio's best work .

551246	989035	120603	5.0	" Them that die bad don't stay in the ground . . . "	Toni Morrison story about a former servant in post-Civil War Ohio , working as a cook and living with her troubled teenage daughter ( in a house touched by a spirit from the past ) , is visited by a man she once knew eighteen years ago as a troubled girl from Kentucky ; they forge a loving friendship built upon their memories , but the horrors of their youth sneak back into the yard once a wild child named Beloved shows up and is taken in . Fill-in-the-blanks melodrama moves along fluidly , yet intrinsically keeps tripping itself up . Director Jonathan Demme wants the overstuffed tale to unfold slowly , but by explaining so little about the central characters he risks alienating viewers . Within the first ten minutes , Demme employs a technical effect which looks ( and plays ) cheap , followed by an outpouring of sorrowful family anger which gets the first act off on the wrong foot . The narrative is , in fact , so fuzzy that we're not sure who Oprah Winfrey's character is , how she makes her living , or what her relationship is with her daughter ( who appears disturbed ) . When the stranger Beloved is readily welcomed by Winfrey into the home , talking in a staccato sing-song , we're not told why . Demme seems to think the mood music and the haunted / loving expression on Winfrey's face will tell us what we need to know , but this backfires ( the film is practically intent on shutting out logic , replacing it with soul-bearing emotion ) . Perhaps in an attempt to retain Morrison's prose , the screenwriters don't allow these people to have normal conversations ( it's all steeped in the hypothetical ) . " Beloved " has an interesting pictorial look , although the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is too clear and pristine ( as was " The Color Purple " , for example ) , and the tidy yards and weathered rooms look too Hollywood . Demme darts about avoiding explanations , while Thandie Newton's Beloved skitters about like a banshee . Winfrey , who also co-produced the movie , gives an uneven performance hindered by the dialogue ; her lack of sparkle reminds us she can be a gravely intelligent presence , but her solemn looks of longing don't register anything intriguing ( we're supposed to be drawn to this woman because of Winfrey's personality , I assume , yet with Oprah so subdued we're left with nothing but a skin-deep portrait ) . It's a large-scale failure , a misbegotten venture , with eyes rimmed with tears , mouths torn by grief , hands grasping and clutching . It whips up quite a tempest , yet it is mostly hot air . from
551004	989035	405422	6.0	Sex + love = real happiness	Barbed , ribald , occasionally tasteless comedy does have a definite plus : it has an unashamed big heart ( and a surprisingly old-fashioned undermining ) . Steve Carell plays a middle-aged kid , a tech-store stock manager into monster toys and video games , who confesses to his buddies at work that he is still , in fact , a sexual novice . Slick , commercial comedy directed by Judd Apatow , who co-wrote the screenplay with Carell , doesn't condescend to its main character ( his celibacy isn't something he chose or planned on , it's merely a hurdle in his life - - and although he's goaded into conquering the beast , he goes about that in his own way ) . The movie is alternately a sunny sex farce and a more sympathetic character-comedy about being true to yourself , with colorful weirdos filling the cast and lots of smart , insightful talk . Apatow is a giddy force behind the camera , and while his plot creaks and groans at times ( particularly in the last third ) , it doesn't necessarily strike one as a highly-concocted audience pleaser until just after the end-credits roll . from
552656	989035	390521	6.0	Morgan Spurlock charts a fast-food course for his own demise . . .	Healthy documentarian in New York City , spurred on by a lawsuit against the fast-food chain McDonald's by two overweight teen girls , decides to go on a junk food eating binge - - having breakfast , lunch and dinner at Mickey D's for 30 straight days - - to prove not only how unhealthy the food is , but unhealthy our collective eating habits are . Morgan Spurlock targets not only McDonald's in his self-assigned task , but also the food suppliers for America's elementary and high schools , most of whom are drowning today's youth in sugar and high cholesterol . Two-thirds of the way through his experiment , Spurlock's own cholesterol has skyrocketed , his weight is up substantially , and his liver is on the brink of malfunctioning . " Super Size Me " is certainly an informative and thought-provoking documentary , paced in a breezy , lightly amusing style , yet one begins to wonder about Spurlock's main impetus and agenda behind this potentially life-damaging high-fat diet ; frequently using TV commercials ( without their soundtracks ) and animation to underline his points , he intentionally ( and crassly ) becomes a purveyor of shock value ( which is where the footage from a gastric bypass comes in ) . Spurlock himself is an easy-going presence , and he's the perfect Everyman to host this film , but what are his motives ? Is really he really concerned about the health habits of our population ? The many faceless shots of men and women wandering around town with big bottoms and flabby tummies are not shown to be benefiting from any of Spurlock's overall denunciations ( they're just visual targets ) and the segues to the medical personnel don't do much to spike the proceedings ( the doctors seem as worried about Spurlock as Spurlock is about the rest of us ) . In the end , the film is a skin-deep examination of a worrisome issue . McDonald's Restaurants come off not as cause or effect , but as a middlemen : a high-fat supplier we welcome into our lives . Personally , I prefer Del Taco . from
552689	989035	78616	6.0	Unusual ( if not bizarre ) casting in sexed-up remake of the 1953 classic . . .	James Jones ' novel of overheated lives on a Hawaiian Army Base - - just prior to the Japanese bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 - - filtered through the 1953 screenplay by Daniel Taradash before being reworked by new writers Harold Gast and Don McGuire , ostensibly to give the old chestnut some bolder action and sex appeal . There's definitely more skin - - and more sinister machismo - - on-screen , but by taking on the Oscar-winning theatrical adaptation from ' 53 , one has to wonder just what the producers of this TV mini-series hoped to gain ? Luckily , they've got Natalie Wood in the role of the Army Captain's estranged wife ( with plenty of movie star allure , Wood gives the part her all , winning a Golden Globe for Best Actress ) ; unfortunately , the rest of the cast is made up of television names ( William Devane , Andy Griffith ) , B-list stalwarts ( Roy Thinnes , Richard Bright ) , wild card newcomers ( Kim Basinger , Steve Railsback ) , and several very odd choices ( Peter Boyle as " Fatso " , Will Sampson as Corporal Cheney , Joe Pantoliano in Frank Sinatra's signature role of Maggio ) . Aside from Wood , the best acting comes from muscular Devane as Sergeant Warden ( despite his tendency to play hardball by making tough-guy faces ) and Railsback , too , is interesting in the ex-boxer role left behind by Montgomery Clift . Railsback approaches the stubborn rebellion of Private Prewitt with understated ease , but the often daft teleplay leaves him in a lurch whenever he's called on to get surly in a bordello or argue with his marriage-minded island squeeze ( sample dialogue : " You think I wanna take care of some snot-nosed little brat and work all day in the pineapple fields ? ! " ) . Veteran director Buzz Kulik must have felt the pressure to pull off some sort of TV miracle here , but his staging is uneven and cumbersome , most especially in the group scenes when there doesn't even appear to be a director's hand present . Moments of the presentation ( 278 minutes on video ) are pure pap , while the the color photography , locations , set designs , and costumes appear second rate .

Chicago cop Burt Reynolds is suspended after a sting operation goes terribly wrong ; he turns in his badge but finds work playing bodyguard to hooker Liza Minnelli , who was a witness to the massacre that got Reynolds in hot water . Burt seems to be suffering from Chronic Fatigue - - he's barely present - - however vivacious Liza ( too old really to be playing prostitutes ) does manage to greatly elevate this crime-drama , although the solid technical aspects , fine supporting cast and gritty locales are also quite good . While it combines corny comedic asides , a very odd villain , and jarring bursts of violence , " Rent-a-Cop " is pretty much a mess , and professional critics snubbed it , yet it is entertaining enough and the two stars share some great chemistry ( even with Burt so sleepy ) . from

Soon though , she almost inadvertently manages to charm him , as well as two other men . What is Ann-Margret doing to drive all these eligible bachelors crazy ? As far as we in the audience can see : nothing . Yes , she gets to dance a little and sing a pretty ditty on the docks , but the character is haphazardly written . One minute she's a firebrand , the next she's icy , almost frigid . Judging from her teasing and emotional schizophrenia , it's unlikely that suave Louis Jourdan would even give her the time of day .
552518	989035	320244	6.0	Artifically superficial . . .	Macaulay Culkin gives an uneven performance as a fey young man from Nowhere who comes to New York City and attaches himself to glitzy , garish club-goer Seth Green , learning what makes a ' nobody ' fabulous and successful ; he turns a flagging nightclub around and gains the respect of its owner , later his financial backer , which quickly ushers in a freaky , drug-induced flurry of hangers-on , leading to tragedy . Wobbly comedy-drama wants to be as casually indifferent and cartoonishly bitchy as its characters - - but when things gets more serious in the last-act , it isn't clear how much we're supposed to care . Like the filmmakers , Seth Green seems to be doing this as a lark , and though it takes an actors bravery to go out on a limb with a part like this , Green is only half-hearted . Supporting performances by Diana Scarwid and Dylan McDermott are much better , but the whole project seems tainted from the start . Is this a cautionary fable or are these Club Kids just painted-up Dead End Kids , the dregs of society burn-out ? And , if so , why should we find their self-delusion so fabulous ? from
552024	989035	113957	6.0	Flimsy , far-fetched , but spunky and attractive	Sandra Bullock is very appealing as an unloved independent systems analyst who unknowingly gets ahold of a disk that could bring worldwide chaos ; pretty soon , she's dodging bad guys , running from the cops and putting her allies in danger ( Dennis Miller , who is surprisingly good ) . Despite a penchant for filming mouths close-up , Irwin Winkler has directed a very fast , fun technical-thriller in which charming Bullock is bounced from one nightmare to another . I loved the way she gets out of a building swarming with security : she dons a fireman's outfit and escapes , but then the bad guys see a nicely piled fireman's outfit ( and helmet ! ) sitting on the sidewalk and yell , " She's getting away ! " Just one example of how this movie is so completely brainless , but yet entertaining enough on a non-think level that you tell yourself not to notice .

551120	989035	60112	6.0	Fizzy romantic comedy occasionally fizzles out . . .	Broadway hit about a married millionaire's mistress befriended by his unsuspecting wife and cooed over by a loyal associate . Lots of slamming doors , comical deception , hissy fits and balloons - - okay ingredients for a frothy fracas , and the cast is good . Jane Fonda overacts all over the place , but she's delicious dropping dry wisecracks ( she really keeps this material popping ) . The picture is so ready-made to be adorable , with little ' shockable ' lines dotting the script , that it's easy to see why critics dismissed it . Some of the jokes are about 5 years out of date ( this might have been perfectly pleasant if made in 1960 or ' 61 ) . The plush production and the tinkly music set a jovial mood , but I bet this looked awfully archaic coming into the Free Love generation . from
553442	989035	86637	6.0	Moments of mad-genius inspiration	Woody Allen's " Zelig " appears to be a wispy-thin string of sketches about a chameleon man who can radically alter his appearance to fit into any given situation , and theatergoers in 1983 may have found the release an Allen-underachiever . It has no higher aspirations than getting quick , momentary laughs from its flaky visual jokes , and a leading character who isn't meant to be memorable or even personally intriguing . The film is pure film-making style , a triumph of creating a whole feature from technique , although Allen's satirical side is as sharp as ever . Mia Farrow has a negligible role as Zelig's psychiatrist ( although she amusingly - - perhaps intentionally - - resembles Liv Ullmann magically transferred from Bergman's " Autumn Sonata " ) , while Woody , in the lead , has great fun with fads , fashions , and nostalgia . The humor here isn't cutting-edge , although the effects are remarkable . " Zelig " is so slyly silly it may pass right under your radar , but it has some very amusing bits and pieces . from
551196	989035	201128	6.0	Inconsistently developed and predictable . . . but with pleasant moments and a star-turn from La Fawcett	Lawrence Naumoff's book turned into a sketchy , meandering vehicle for star Farrah Fawcett , playing a ne'er-do-well good-time girl who pops into her rural hometown only to find she's missed her beloved mama's funeral and that her sister is planning to sell off the old homestead . She decides to work at the local factory and buy sis out , and catches the eye of the hunky foreman ( who looks like a clean-shaven Kris Kristofferson in his youth ) . Up to this point , the TV-made " Silk Hope " has some drive and a rousing character in Fawcett's Frannie Vaughn , but though the dialogue is smart and has a truthful edge , the plot manages to get all balled up . Frannie is supposed to be flighty and irrational , but how she thinks making pocket change at the factory ( or starting a pig farm ) will help her win the house back is never explained . When Farrah digs deep as an actress , she's more than capable of bringing out a forthright woman who doesn't take baloney from anybody , but too often here she slips into a little girl act ( with a light , tinkly voice ) ; in her quieter moments she's very good , and very attractive ( if rail-thin ) , and she's really the only reason to watch the movie . The bumpy narrative darts about from one half-finished sequence to the next , including the proverbial county fair , the emergency at the factory , a crisis in the family , a hunt for Daddy who's been missing for ages , and Frannie standing up to her bosses at work as if she were Eleanor Roosevelt . It just doesn't wash , but then it probably wasn't meant to be an incisive , dramatic entertainment . . . just a piece of fluff .

"	Jean Simmons doesn't exactly have the face of an angel , but that doesn't mean she's miscast in " Angel Face " ; on the contrary , Simmons ' hard , placid neuroses get a worthy workout in this glossy noir , turning the film's title into an ironic gag . Even though Simmons is not a juicy or sympathetic villainess , she's a compelling one , and director Otto Preminger gets an even-keeled , non-campy performance from her . Robert Mitchum is typically sturdy as a shallow stud , an ambulance driver in Los Angeles who is swayed by the step-daughter of a wealthy socialite ; she wants to be his benefactor and his lover , but when her plans are spoiled she quietly seethes and plots . Complicated drama is absorbing and compelling , if infuriating and unpleasant . People like these most assuredly exist , but watching this no-win situation play out isn't exactly entertaining . Preminger turns the screws slowly and carefully , and while we're drawn in by the mechanisms of the plot , the characters are by turns heartless , selfish , thoughtless and contemptible . from
550649	989035	86154	6.0	Spacy Meg Tilly : the perfect ally for Norman Bates !	Anthony Perkins reportedly felt threatened as an actor playing opposite Meg Tilly ( portraying a slightly-dazed cupcake who befriends Norman Bates , just out of the asylum ) ; if true , he had good reason , for Tilly is very appealing in her role and this sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's classic screamer gains a spirit of its own - - away from its predecessor - - every time she's on-screen . The plot is business-as-usual , with a lot of repetitive , cornball dialogue ( " It's my mother ! " " No , it's MY mother ! " ) . It's great to see those famous sets again , and the filmmakers try to create a stylish , old-fashioned atmosphere at the outset , but a gory , dispiriting conclusion and a dumbbell tag at the end ( designed for another sequel ) weakens the whole shebang . out of
551097	989035	79613	6.0	" An attraction for obliteration . . . "	Magazine editor Hal Holbrook , husband to a manic depressive and father to three kids who ignore him , contemplates killing himself with a rifle after first eliminating each member of his family . Technically adept , solidly performed drama is decidedly grim , occasionally insufferable , but undeniably potent - - and surprisingly relevant to the times . Director Jeff Kanew , who also adapted Julius Horwitz's novel , goes out on a limb with this non-commercial material , yet he makes a few missteps in the process . With the firm conclusion that " all married men have this fantasy " , Kanew seems to think that familial obliteration is an all-encompassing issue - - an epidemic among dissatisfied husbands and middle-aged fathers - - without any facts to back this up . Kanew's decision to have the man's wife suddenly come out of her fog and attempt to reach her husband with intelligent conversation doesn't quite work ; most viewers won't be able to connect with him , either - - he's like the evil villain on a soap opera - - all of which causes Kanew's ending to seem like a cop-out ( especially the way it's presented ) . Louise Fletcher gets some good speeches as the Mrs . , and her forthright plea for mutual understanding is commendable , but Kanew doesn't allow her to be strong , and the three children ( who have no lines , nor personalities ) appear to be equally lethargic and dim . Hal Holbrook's lead performance is unvarying in its grimness and , while he's a superlative actor , one tends to recoil from scenes of him sexing it up at a brothel ( or , even more excruciating , chit-chatting with the naked prostitutes in bed about his ground-up life ) . Many interesting points are made in the midst of a dramatic muddle , and yet the coldness inherent in the handling comes off as abject indifference . from

Despite the odd locale , a blithe , easy romantic comedy , well-tailored for stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan . Director Lubitsch never strains for big laughs ; true , he doesn't get them , but instead he strives for a more gentle type of comedy with humor deriving from character development and situation - - not jokes . Quite appealing ; remade in 1949 as " In The Good Old Summertime " , staged as the musical " She Loves Me " , and remade yet again in 1998 as " You've Got Mail " . from

Carol Reed directed this handsome Hitchcockian thriller about an American author arriving in post-World War II Vienna and learning his best friend was recently killed in a car accident . . . or was he ? After some detective work , the writer uncovers the dark truth . Filmed in chilly black-and-white , Reed's picture has a brooding ambiance that is initially intriguing but may be too much of a good thing ; the stark visuals coupled with the downbeat tone and talky , complicated plot wears one down after a while . The performances by Orson Welles and Joesph Cotton are quite good , as is the zither music on the soundtrack , but overall it's an exasperating movie , full of promising scenes that don't quite take shape and have no pay-off . Alfred Hitchcock was a bit more playful with his stories ; this one could have stood some hearty relief . from
553429	989035	59253	6.0	" You're a national institution . . . like the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty ! "	The rise of Hollywood's first blonde bombshell , Jean Harlow , who died tragically at the age of 26 . Magna Pictures distributed this low-budget venture , which was first shot on an early form of videotape and then transferred to film . It competed with Paramount's version of Harlow's story ( also entitled " Harlow " and released in 1965 ! ) , but because of its unusual pedigree , this effort ( ambitious , if rough ) was hardly seen . Carol Lynley portrays Jean not as the raucous , lovable gal who made friends so easily , but as a volatile , impatient , often heartless young woman who wasn't quick to take good advice . Lynley does well in the role , even if her body type isn't right and her voice falls short ( her performance actually improves as the movie progresses , and she has a very strong scene with mama Ginger Rogers near the end ) . Some identities have been changed , and Harlow's first and third marriages are barely mentioned , but the movie makes its point with little pomposity : this was a troubled young woman who had no inkling of her own impact with movie-going audiences , constantly short-changing herself in the romance department . Rogers does solid work ; Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . , as a movie idol à la William Powell , Hurd Hatfield as tortured producer Paul Bern , and Lloyd Bochner as a director are each excellent in support . Does any of it ring true ? Probably not . Writer Karl Tunberg seems to have constructed his script out of fan magazine articles , and the picture is fairly useless for those wanting to know the real dish on the 1930s superstar . Still , there are interesting accents and attributes throughout " Harlow " , and it is seldom dull . from
551819	989035	250797	6.0	Elegant , but curiously lacking in suspense or danger . . .	Overly-familiar , curiously bland flip-side to " Fatal Attraction " from " Fatal " director Adrian Lyne concerns wife and mother Diane Lane traveling from the New York suburbs into SoHo where she ' meets cute ' with a handsome stud ; she's drawn to him and soon returns , beginning a lusty secret affair that her husband may be wise to . Fails to stir up the same kind of controversy that permeated " Attraction " simply because this one isn't as well written ( and is designed like a heated Harlequin romance to boot ) . None of this is the fault of the players : Lane ( despite a penchant for making faces ) is very good in the lead and Richard Gere is effectively low-keyed as her milquetoast spouse . Yet there's nothing exceptional or gripping about this story , and the final act is so colorlessly drawn-out that our sympathies ultimately shift away from the troubled couple . from

Hepburn heads up a charming group of gals in the research department of a broadcasting firm ; Tracy is a computer man eager to install his latest creation in their office . Adapted from the Broadway play - - and looking it - - with large , flat sets stretched across the screen and all the actors moving from stage right to stage left . Still , the cast is colorful ( except for Gig Young , stuck in the eternal Gig Young role , that of an SOB second banana who eventually ends up eating crow ) , and the thing is bubbly fun right to the end . It disappears from memory as fast as it came , but this kind of lightweight venture can be enjoyable on an afternoon viewing . from

Allegorical talk-fest won William Hurt an Oscar as the flamboyant Luis Molina , though Raul Julia is just as fine in his role and the art direction and cinematography are fabulous . Still , this story , infused with character-oriented drama , palls just before the final act , becoming too literal and confusing our feelings towards Molina . Leonard Schrader based his screenplay on the novel by Manuel Puig , and his layers of romantic / exotic fantasy atop the harsh realities of the central situation is exciting for any literate audience , yet the determination to ground this plot in a violent sweep leads to some dissatisfaction .

Screenwriters Peter Viertel , Joan Harrison , and ( of all people ) Dorothy Parker enable director Alfred Hitchcock to expound on what may have been his favorite movie theme : innocent man , wrongly fingered for crime , takes it on the lam . Hitchcock , who some credit with originating the story , engineers a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend ; he sets out on journey to find the real culprit . Plenty of excitement on a grand-scale , with usually-colorless actors ( Priscilla Lane , Norman Lloyd , Alan Baxter ) doing surprisingly fine work .

Alicia Silverstone is adorable , but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked ( they all get their share of funny lines and star-making scenes , particularly Dan Hedaya , superb as Silverstone's father ) .

551954	989035	53247	7.0	Polite and well-heeled melodrama . . . and surprisingly quite enjoyable	Provincial University professor from England chances to meet his diabolical , selfish twin while on vacation in Paris . Daphne Du Maurier's novel gets a highly polished screen-treatment , with star Alec Guinness very fine in the dual role , the split-screen photography and editing pulled off with skill . After being tricked into assuming the French nobleman's eccentric life , the teacher finds himself settling well into this new role as a business tycoon and family man - - until his glinty-eyed look-alike returns . Bette Davis has a small but important , amusing role as a dowager Countess , and there's also a wreck of a wife , a wise little girl , a loyal chauffeur , and an Italian mistress . Gore Vidal worked on the adaptation , and the literate script is absorbing yet constricting for the teacher-character ( he can only attempt to explain so much without throwing the whole plot off-course ) . There's a lot of talk in the early stages that the Count is delusional and perhaps schizophrenic , all of which is quickly dropped once the teacher assumes his life . Still , it's a smartly-planned movie , one without hysterics or false dramatics . Guinness seems a bit uncomfortable at times , though this may have been intentional and is acceptable behavior here . A very entertaining film with some weak or disappointing passages , but just as many adept ones and a satisfying finish . from

"	Marvelous film , an extension of the British kitchen-sink dramas from earlier in the decade ( but with a friskier spirit ) , introduced audiences to Vanessa Redgrave's kid sister , Lynn ( in an Oscar-nominated performance ) . She's Georgina , a too-tall , plain and frumpy , kissless clown , a nursery school teacher who plays second-fiddle to her more beautiful flat-mate - - and harbors a crush on her pal's sexy boyfriend in the bargain . While dodging the advances of her father's wealthy employer , Georgina also serves as nursemaid to her roommate when she becomes pregnant , never dreaming of the circumstances to follow . From Margaret Forster's novel , which she co-adapted with Peter Nichols , the film is visually alive , stylish and skittering about with " free and easy " abandon ( yet with moral choices and a sobering heart at its center ) . Redgrave is nothing short of fabulous here ; her " Georgy " is often slumped over sulking , an easy mark with little sense of humor - - she's either completely inflexible or terribly over-eager . The writing is so clever and enticing for everyone on-screen that the supporting characters tend to upstage Redgrave ( and , indeed , her moods are exasperating near the end ) , but Lynn is a wonderful presence . Also excellent : Charlotte Rampling as pregnant Meredith ( who gets the film's most viciously funny lines ) , Alan Bates as her devilish lover , and James Mason as the older man who is the first to harbor a fancy for our heroine . A delightful bit of comedy-drama , one of the few from this era not to use ' mod ' touches to set the time and place . It is as fresh and breezy today as in 1966 . from

A touching story told with tenderness : awkward young Jewish girl in WWII America befriends an escaped Nazi POW who is hiding out in her clubhouse . They discuss their lives , she sneaks him food , he becomes her only friend and ally . All this reminded me of the much-better theatrical film " Whistle Down The Wind " , where Hayley Mills befriends convict Alan Bates , but you certainly can't fault the direction here , which is smooth , or the performances , which are sterling . Mature in her pre-teen years , Kristy McNichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note . Suddenly , when the prisoner is discovered ( and Kristy is found out as well ) , the movie gets very tough . Her father , shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with a Nazi , lays into her with a quiet fury I have seldom seen before ( he tells her " You are dead to me , " which must be devastating for a little girl to hear ) . The final scenes don't cop out : there are no big reunions , no holding hands . The girl has to face the world , and in doing so learns a cynical lesson about neighbors , friends , and family . A startling film . from

A true story set in the African wild which plays like a wild-life fantasy : childless couple working in Kenya ( he's a game warden who hunts ferocious animals ) adopt three orphaned lion cubs and rear them like babies . When they start growing and becoming a household nuisance , two cubs are sent to a zoo but the runt of the litter stays with the couple - - growing particularly close to the wife , who soon finds it hard to let go emotionally when the cub turns into a lioness and is ready for mating . Sloppily-made family film from a best-selling book isn't particularly expressive ; it's a heart-tugger with no headier goal , one designed to inspire lots of " awwww " ' s from the audience . Yet the curiously benign humans at the center of the story are one-dimensional - - they are just good-hearted people who seem to love overgrown kittens - - while the wife's voice-over is in the spirit of a bedtime story ( with careful warnings of what's up coming next ) . The photography is uneven and the direction of the piece is all on one heartfelt note . There's not even much animal excitement here . On a purely sentimental level ( with the theme of ' letting loved ones go ' heavily prevalent ) , the movie is an effective tear-jerker , sweet as candy , and will certainly involve both the young and the young at heart . from

Mockumentary extraordinaire ! Endless pithy witticisms from actor-co-writer-director Christopher Guest , whose troupe includes some really marvelous talent , all of whom get a chance to shine here . Occasionally , the targets are flabby or obvious ( lots of ' bitch ' jokes and a labored marital spat over a squeeze toy ) , but otherwise this is right on target . The outré humor which coated Guest's " Waiting For Guffman " in 1996 ( and had , at times , a sour residue ) is toyed with here in a much more loving way . I got the feeling Guest genuinely liked this group of characters better than the " Guffman " bunch ; and though he does poke and prod at them with his camera - - and encourage his actors to go all the way with the material - - the nimble editing never wears them out , and the picture does not overstay its welcome . from

With the cooperation of Ringling Bros . and Barnum & Bailey behind him , director and showman Cecil B . DeMille delivers a colorful circus-spectacular full of animals and acrobatics , however the overripe screenplay ( worked on by four credited scenarists ) combines " stardust and sawdust " of the most melodramatic kind . Trapeze artists Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde vie for the center ring - - but when Wilde is suddenly injured , his spotlight isn't dimmed for too long ( DeMille glosses over the rough stuff ; he's not a filmmaker interested in details and he likes a happy ending ) . Charlton Heston is the financial manager and boss of the traveling tent-show , yet , aside from some monetary disputes at the beginning , we aren't told very much about the money-end of the show or how the performers spend their checks on their down time ( do they have off-season lives at all ? ) . DeMille is also uninterested in the freaky end of carny life - - to him it's all in the family - - though he does touch upon the corruption of the midway and some of the back-biting amongst the starlets . A little trimming might've made the picture more immediate ( some of the parades go on too long , and I would've cut Dorothy Lamour's Hawaiian number , though it contains a surprise cameo which gets a big laugh ) . Betty Hutton , who sings like a brick , must be the most masochistic trapeze chanteuse who ever defied death , but Gloria Grahame is fun as a wisecracking elephant assistant and Heston strikes an appropriately no-nonsense stance which , while largely wooden , works for this picture . As for James Stewart as Buttons the Clown , he's supposed to be a little mysterious , a question mark , but DeMille and his editor cut to Stewart far too often and he's on-screen far too much ( they want to make sure we don't miss a trick , such is the way the unsubtle drama is mechanically laid out ) . This Oscar-winning Best Picture is big-big-big , but like all epics this one has its peaks and valleys . It's really corny , but like the man said , " You can shake the sawdust out of your shoes , but not out of your heart ! " from
550646	989035	105572	7.0	" I'm just a girl who lived across the street from you . . . and I don't now ! "	Extremely sensitive and touching film about childhood , and a youngster's need to be " saved " from her own age of innocence . Juliette Lewis is fantastic as vampy young woman in 1960s suburbia whose affair with a greasy-haired rebel becomes the focal point for a little girl who lives across the street . The film's dreamy / quirky tone is reminiscent of " Men Don't Leave " , and its depiction of a big-hearted kid trying to connect with a world much larger than she is both nostalgic and sympathetic . Filled with small but wonderful little touches , thoughtful nuances and a quiet , sweet ending . Well worth-seeing . This may be the best performance yet from Juliette Lewis - - she's flawless . from
551051	989035	59885	7.0	Robust war epic with hearty Sinatra performance . . .	Superior WWII adventure has American Colonel Frank Sinatra leading large group of English POW's in takeover of a Nazi train near Milano , Italy . Fine characterizations and a full-bodied direction by Mark Robson give this epic a vivid sweep . Full of humor and pathos , the film doesn't present the Nazis as weak targets or stumblebums - - they are all-business , and an evil , clever opponent in war . The Americans struggle and plan , they come up with ideas that don't work out and have to rely on man-power and each other to survive . Excellent work from Sinatra , plus terrific supporting performances by Trevor Howard and Edward Mulhare ( who , as the American priest , has a very funny sequence where he's called upon to impersonate a Nazi ) . A good show , one with a curiously downbeat , but thoughtful and well-staged finale . from
551524	989035	79477	7.0	You'll want to see Venice ( and the Bridge of Sighs )	Smashing romantic comedy-drama about two youngsters in love . A movie-loving French boy and the American daughter of a movie actress meet and eventually run away from France to Venice to seal their love within the bonds of a legend - - never suspecting the romantic story they've been told is a tall one , thought up by a wily pickpocket ( Laurence Olivier , hammy but not overdoing it ) who ends up acting as their guardian . Herky-jerky continuity and a too-heavy police interrogation sequence do not mar otherwise lovely and funny film with a beautiful score by Georges Delerue ( which deservedly won an Oscar ) . Diane Lane , in her debut , is a wise little princess with understanding eyes and a husky , charming voice . from
551575	989035	103074	7.0	Despite some fundamental weaknesses , it has really held up over time . . .	Two accidental female fugitives elude the police while attempting to drive across the Southwest to Mexico . Filmmaker Ridley Scott shows a terrific talent for directing women here , and the performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are almost uncanny . One can hardly believe that these two haven't been friends for years , their give and take seems so lived in . Salty waitress Sarandon , initially the savvier of the two , is loose and girly with Arkansas housewife Davis in the beginning , but both their colors change , with each woman eventually taking turns playing the brains ( I didn't really believe it when , having been pulled over a cop in the desert , Sarandon's Louise becomes kind of a dingbat , but you accept it for the moment and the movie quickly rolls on ) . The men in the cast obviously don't get much of a chance to shine , but Harvey Keitel does the understanding detective bit very well ( it's almost the same character he portrayed in " Mortal Thoughts " ) ; Brad Pitt has a scene-stealing , star-making role as a cowboy hustler , yet this film took a long time to gain a fully appreciative audience . It did modest business and garnered Oscar nominations for the ladies , but only afterward did it take on some resonance ( it's now viewed as a feminist statement and has a loyal following among lesbian audiences ) . It creaks a little , and the twangy main theme gives way to a ridiculously melodramatic score , but the narrative is so tight and the women are so good that it keeps you watching - - and returning . from
551641	989035	539238	7.0	Cluttered script fails to flesh out the large cast of characters . . . but the girls look great	An ambitious episode of the detective series which might have been better as a two-hour special , or a TV-movie ; there simply isn't time on the clock to do justice to all these ideas . The Angels investigate a modeling agency after a startling beauty ( a " dead ringer " for Kelly ) is found strangled with a rag doll ( seems she was just coming out of the shower , so why was she wearing a smashed diamond watch on her wrist ? ) . Among the suspects : a fey photographer who comes off like a bitchy gay ( but who is revealed to be a kinky straight ! ) , a Dutch designer who bristles at any sexual innuendo , a leather-jacket wearing toughie who does nothing but hang around , the director of the company ( who was having an affair with the dead model ) and his estranged wife , herself a fashion star . Jill and Kelly pose as models , Sabrina cons her way into a job as a stylist , but more girls are attacked - - as well as one male in a sour , unfair plot thump . Some tasty dialogue exchanges ( and Jaclyn Smith in a stunning white bikini , covered for no reason by a light wrap ) make this an enjoyable installment , even if the writers can't quite cover all their tracks ( how can the killer possibly hope to pass off one murder as a suicide ? and why does Kelly attempt to stop the fleeing strangler by standing in front of his speeding van , waving her arms ? ) . Kate Jackson has a funny encounter with the photog ( who nearly defiles her ! ) , while Farrah Fawcett-Majors does an outstanding job in her little bits and pieces with Alex Henteloff as Heinz . Henteloff does something amazing with this seemingly throwaway role : he creates a three-dimensional character out of just four or five scenes ( without many lines ) and we instantly connect with his lonely heart ( he does masterful work , aided by La Fawcett ) . Bosley does the usual paperwork back at the office , while the girls settle on a theory - - and , as usual , their assessments are right on the money .
550858	989035	561419	7.0	Amo Que Paso ?	Annette Funicello does her second guest turn on Walt Disney's television serial " Zorro " ( this episode being part of the " Disneyland " series , separate from the regular two-season run of " Zorro " ) . She plays a young miss from Santa Clara who arrives to visit her adoptive " uncle " Don Alejandro who , along with son Don Diego , suspects the girl is in romantic trouble when a suitor with designs on her dowry comes to call . Well-written story keeps Guy Williams busy switching from Diego to Zorro , though some may complain Zorro isn't around enough . There's some funny action , amusingly " bratty " behavior from Annette ( who also sings two songs ) , but a peculiar bit with Sergeant Demetrio apparently getting drunk in the tavern ( and having a tussle with the barmaid over his many mugs of ale ) . Not the best episode in " Zorro " ' s run , but still quite entertaining .
552607	989035	175880	8.0	Byzantine collection of California lives	Absorbing , shocking , grandiose , overwrought . . . words that only fitfully describe a generally undefinable movie about different characters in California . It is filmed with such sweeping passion , such oddly nuanced grace , that I was willing to overlook some of the nastiness in the handling and the long sections of talk that really don't tell us anything . The acting by the all-star cast is terrific ( particularly John C . Reilly as a dedicated cop who wants to be loved ) , Aimee Mann's songs are haunting , the production is flawless , but it's a very difficult picture to sit through . I had to take a time-out in between videotapes just to catch my breath . from .
550527	989035	70321	8.0	Stella Stevens in perfectly shrewish " Poseidon Adventure " mode	After seeing " The Poseidon Adventure " in 1972 , I had a new favorite actress : I thought Stella Stevens stole the show ! So it was a wonderful surprise to see this TV-film advertised on ABC's Movie of the Week - - just a few months after I had ' discovered ' this fantastic lady . It all begins with Stella gunning a woman down on the beach . Suffice it to say , there are crosses and double-crosses that really threw me for a loop . The film was remade ( again for TV ) with Richard Thomas playing Linda's naive husband , but I didn't watch it because I didn't want to ruin my memories of this version . I haven't seen it in years , but I found out it was based on a well-regarded book by John D . MacDonald . I wish it had some loyal followers . As for Stella Stevens , she's right on the money : selfish , sarcastic , and appealing as hell .
552354	989035	78444	8.0	Mazursky's penchant for the sublimely ridiculous gives the film a wafty comic undertone . . .	An acting triumph for Jill Clayburgh , playing a N . Y . C . wife and mother whose husband tells her he's fallen in love with another woman . Brittle , biting , funny , and moving serious-comedy benefits from a screenplay which is sometimes strangely over-the-top and yet nearly always on-track emotionally . In his determination to find The Truth about the American woman in the 1970's , writer-director Paul Mazursky gets a little kooky : Clayburgh's Erica throws up on the street after her husband confesses his affair ; she later fends off the affections of both her doctor and a blind date ( one of those guys who tries covering his bald scalp with overlong side hairs ) . She's also in therapy and her doctor turns out to be a lesbian ( and we never see Erica in therapy again ) . The mother-daughter dynamics between Clayburgh and tough little nut Lisa Lucas are precise and believable ; when Mom brings a man over for dinner , daughter feels defensive and gets mouthy . But the night ends playfully , with the ladies playing piano together and singing Paul McCartney ! Alan Bates enters in the second-act as a burly , not-pushy artist who falls for Erica , yet she's not so sure . Why she's so reluctant to throw down her defenses for this man isn't made quite clear ( playful , sexy Bates would be a godsend to any unattached woman ) . The film isn't necessarily logical , though it takes pride in being flaky and tart . There are big , passionate feelings in " An Unmarried Woman " and , instead of being some kind of emotional work-out , it is surprisingly romantic ( which ticked some feminists off , who wanted more than lightweight laughs ) . I enjoyed it , although it probably seems dated by today's standards . It certainly is peculiar , with Mazursky's penchant for outrageous dialogue punctuated by genuinely affecting emotions . from
552276	989035	219699	8.0	Haunting and deliciously involving	Southern psychic and single parent Cate Blanchett is pulled against her will into the logistics of a popular local girl's disappearance . Although the brutality inherent in the script is laid on with a trowel , " The Gift " has many mesmerizing moments , not the least of which is the casting of luminous Blanchett , sensational in the lead . Anyone who has seen Kevin Bacon's " Stir Of Echoes " will notice some curious similarities , but I found this movie much preferable , as it uses a terrific ensemble cast to its full advantage , and weaves a plot that is by turns outrageous and completely absorbing . I bought right into " The Gift " and stayed with it breathlessly every step of the way . from
552142	989035	70510	10.0	" But . . . I . . . don't . . . have it ! " . . . " Then get it ! "	Exceptionally winning and entertaining film , a lovely piece of yesterday groomed by extraordinary cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs and director Peter Bogdanovich . Adapted by Alvin Sargent from the novel " Addie Pray " , story of a con-artist in the Depression who gets saddled with a streetwise orphan doesn't mess with moral issues , instead plows ahead with high laughter and gritty sentiment . Smashing performances by everyone in the cast : Ryan O'Neal in particular does some of his finest work ; 9-year-old Tatum O'Neal , with her lisp and icy stare , is clever and endearing , winning the Supporting Oscar ; Madeline Kahn is a hoot as Trixie Delight ; P . J . Johnson wonderful as Kahn's maid . Simply terrific - - and one of the best films of all time . from
552780	989035	94721	10.0	Has a crazy rhythm all its own	It may take two or three viewings to warm up to " Beetlejuice " . It has a kooky , cockeyed sensibility and a rhythm that is by turns easy , lazy and frenetic . A charming couple in New England die and come back to their beloved home as ghosts , determined to rid the place of the horrendous new tenants . Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin ; Geena Davis , Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing . The new couple from New York who take over the house ( Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara ) aren't as well written or thought-out as the other characters and some of their bemused , dry-ice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you . Of course , there's Michael Keaton , wildly comic as Betelgeuse . I heard a lot of comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile , but that's only if you only watch the film for the fast quips and sight-gags . Keaton is truly wonderful , but he's also bombastic , and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfy - - it's really not his story anyway , it belongs to Baldwin and Davis ; Betelgeuse is used as a horny , vulgar punchline . Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch ; he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story , and he works magic within a dubious scenario : a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life . from
