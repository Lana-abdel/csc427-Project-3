551064	989035	78239	1.0	Robert Stigwood strikes again !	Music-biz impresario Robert Stigwood , head of the now-defunct , mostly-disco label RSO , produced several glitzy or garish movie musicals in the 1970s , this one being the very worst . Half-hearted attempt to turn music by the Beatles ( including the songs and mod look of their album " Sgt . Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band " ) into some kind of screen story ranks right up there with the most ill-fated ideas to leak from Hollywood . George Burns turns up as the Mayor of Heartland , narrating this " plot " about a resident rock group and their struggles with fame and fortune . Bringing together the Bee Gees with Peter Frampton may have seemed like a good idea when this was in pre-production ; truth is , 1978 saw a decline in both acts ' popularity , and the movie was pretty much dead on arrival ( the soundtrack sold better , but wasn't the blockbuster expected ) . Not showcasing the Bee Gees ' best attributes ( doing their sultry mix of disco and soul , and performing it live ) and instead trying to make the three of them actors almost killed their career . A few stray engaging moments , but mostly just embarrassing . NO STARS from
552812	989035	60848	1.0	" It doesn't make sense ! Not any of it ! "	Hilariously awful star-studded turkey , an apparent do-gooder drama concocted by Ian Fleming , sponsored by Xerox and directed by Bond-filmmaker Terence Young , details the United Nations ' efforts to stop the trafficking of opium out of the Middle East . Bungled ingredients include star-cameos , an introduction by Grace Kelly ( ! ) , and Yul Brynner ( misspelled in the credits ) as a fez-topped Colonel who rides out to meet his enemies on horseback as if this were a Samurai western . The curious , sloppy over-dubbing leaves some of the actors looking like foreigners in a spaghetti spy-drama , while Kelly implores us to remember that . . . yes . . . Poppy flowers are attractive and innocent-looking , but their seeds are producing drugs that are destroying our young people ! Not as fast as films like this . E . G . Marshall's somewhat bemused performance is the only asset the picture has to offer . Also known as " The Poppy Is Also a Flower " , " The Opium Connection " and ( my favorite ) " Danger Grows Wild " . NO STARS from
552646	989035	113729	1.0	Teen rubbish	Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse , along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance . I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence ( scored with an abominable rock song ) ; unfortunately , it does . Boy meets girl at school , they flirt , they date , they run off together . The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced . It isn't a fresh spin , although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new , and who knows ? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments . To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating , not to mention terribly irresponsible , and not quite the " wild and sexy adventure " advertised . NO STARS from
551111	989035	71607	1.0	The Disney people in desperation mode . . .	Although it was a hit with kids , this sequel to 1968's " The Love Bug " flounders around for some sort of inspiration , finding it only in the multiple flashbacks to the first picture . There's hardly a whiff of a plot , Helen Hayes looks uncomfortable , and Ken Berry is a poor man's Dean Jones . Worse , the special effects are shoddy , the production values cheap , and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director who practically prods you in the ribs . The Disney Company really lost more than their boss when Walt died ; they lost their direction , most especially in their live-action entertainment , relying on sequels and ( even today ) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding of what their founder was trying to do . " Herbie " is surely at that barrel's bottom .
551644	989035	113755	1.0	Comic inanities served up to families as something unique and gut-busting . . .	Mind-bogglingly bad Disney comedy pits middle-aged sweethearts Chevy Chase and Farrah Fawcett against Fawcett's prankish pre-teen son Jonathan Taylor Thomas ( that smug Keebler elf from the TV sitcom " Home Improvement " ) . After single mom Farrah brings new love-interest Chevy home to meet her kid , Taylor resorts to juvenile tomfoolery to scare the suitor away . . . sound familiar ? Taking its cue from " The Parent Trap " , but blessedly giving us only one child at the helm , this lame-duck script has nowhere to go after the initial set-up . Nice to see Chase and Fawcett together ( the original choices for " Foul Play " ) , but the comic chaos which erupts here is only for undiscriminating viewers . from
553335	989035	465624	1.0	Superhero romantic-comedy hasn't anything romantic or funny in it . . .	It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films ( and later with Fox ) : cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on " Fatal Attraction " . . . voil√† ! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved , unless the pay was just too tempting . A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N . Y . C . meets a girl on the subway and asks her out ; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant , he eventually gets her into bed - - only to find out later she's the Big Apple's resident superhero , G-Girl . This distaff Superman , with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite , isn't a fantasy heroine , however . . . screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy , possessive , vindictive bitch ( he telegraphs this to us from miles away , though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs ) . This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by . Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson , talking with Rainn Wilson on the train , is accompanied by a sour dig at gays ( it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies ' men ) . After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis , who wants to zap her powers , Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned . . . and isn't that better after all ? Thurman's early performances in films like " Henry & June " and " Jennifer 8 " showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise ; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity , but that came at a price ( the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch ) . The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot , with expensive-seeming special effects , yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario . It's pushy , leering , ugly , and badly-cast . Bloated , frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of his co-workers that he's dating G-Girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum . I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious . . . or , indeed , if anyone involved did ? from
550714	989035	114151	1.0	Straight-to-tape " sequel " sans every iota of talent from the predecessor . . .	1992's " Poison Ivy " played like an art-house sleaze-piece with an eye on the cult-movie market ( and , at this , it succeeded , despite a herky-jerky narrative ) . But since the heroine perished in that film's final moments , a sequel would seem unlikely . Not so , as Alyssa Milano's Lily finds out . After discovering and reading a diary written by the doomed Ivy ( played in ' 92 by Drew Barrymore ) , Milano revamps herself , takes on a seamier personality , and causes sexual havoc . Quite a stretch trying to connect the two films , but at least the first movie had an interesting direction and some B-movie style . This dud has neither , nor is Milano the next Drew Barrymore . Followed in 1997 by " Poison Ivy : The New Seduction " . NO STARS from

Laughably awkward teen-opus , filmed on the cheap in black-and-white , concerns young male and female college students battling each other over the rights to a swanky beach-house . It's the boys against the girls ! ( Wouldn't it makes things more interesting for these kids if the pad were co-ed ? ) Worth a quick peek for the musical cameo by Sonny & Cher down at the local hot-spot ( they sing the growly slow-burner " It's Gonna Rain " ) , but their bit comes early - - at the 22-minute mark - - leaving nothing but godawful acting and teenage contrivances for the next hour . Positively painful ! " Wild on the Beach " makes the A . I . P . " Beach Party " flicks seem Oscar-caliber by comparison . from
551999	989035	105629	1.0	Just appalling . . .	" Laughter is a state of mind " says the tag , and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's . What could he have been thinking during the making of " Toys " ? When he watched the rushes , did he see a successful , funny fantasy ? If so , then he's working on a different plane than I . This is an excruciating picture , one in which the production design is 90 % of the thing ( and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment ) . Robin Williams and ( most especially ) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies . There's nothing remotely funny ( satirical or slapstick-wise ) on display here . It is uniformly draggy , ugly , and one of the very worst " big " movies ever made . NO STARS from
551359	989035	114658	1.0	Whoopi Goldberg is almost always worth watching . . . almost	From the What Was She Thinking ? file : Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur ( ! ) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age . Straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous , a high-concept in search of itself . Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director , Jonathan Betuel ( who also served as one of the producers ) ; sadly , the end results are anemic , to be charitable . Goldberg's mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script , but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results . NO STARS from
551452	989035	166252	2.0	Blandly pleasant	Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life . Pet project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw , who gives a warm , nicely-modulated lead performance , yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in . Initially , Capshaw's Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her ( an interesting visual joke ) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres , who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick . Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick , and the continuity is extremely choppy . Supporting cast ( including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott , who mostly acts with his shirt off ) is very good , but they can't save the final act , which is disappointing . Low-keyed , in a quirky , pleasant way , but it is blandly good-natured , nothing more . from
551750	989035	219653	2.0	The 2 , 000th version of " Dracula " ?	Put the blame on executive producer Wes Craven and financiers the Weinsteins for this big-budget debacle : a thrash-metal updating of " Dracula " , with a condescending verbal jab at Bram Stoker ( who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway ) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore . Christopher Plummer looks winded as Van Helsing in the modern-day - - not just a descendant of Van Helsing but the real thing ; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from Count Dracula's corpse , which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and flown to New Orleans . This is just what New Orleans needs in the 21st Century ! The film , well-produced but without a single original idea ( except for multi-racial victims ) , is both repulsive and lazy , and after about an hour starts repeating itself . from
553606	989035	120685	2.0	Sell it on its size - - the rest will take care of itself . . .	Clumsy , elephantine monster-movie remake of a 1954 Japanese cult classic ; an overachieving , multiplex-equivalent of a drive-in theater quickie . Mass hysteria grips the world after a mysterious terror causes destruction and death near Panama ; biologist Matthew Broderick is lured away from his Chernobyl earthworms to help determine the cause and effect of an Atom Bomb-created modern day dinosaur . What could be worse than Godzilla in New York City ? Maybe a dinosaur-sized Hollywood blockbuster designed to break the bank but engineered without a trace of nostalgia ( the picture pretty much throws out the campy fun of the original at the outset , instead replacing it with smarmy " wit " and actors forced to scream at each other ) . Broderick , as Dr . Niko Tatopoulos - - whose last name keeps getting mispronounced - - sings showtunes in his truck but does have an ex-college sweetheart back home ( don't worry folks - - he's straight ! ) ; he gets sexually harassed by his female boss within his first day on the new job - - while back home in NYC , ex-flame Maria Pitillo gets harassed by her boss as well , and yet the filmmakers don't even seem to make the connection ( it's all just " cute " ) . Jean Reno looks entirely out of place with his low-keyed nods and stammers as investigator Philippe Roach√© ( his last name gets mispronounced as well ) , getting in the way of the military while making subtle , pointed observations ( he's like the Truffaut character in " Close Encounters " ) . As an action flick , the film is pumped full of wheezing prestige and misguided ambition , too much of it for the picture to be any fun . As a career killer , it did send Broderick back to Broadway . from
553650	989035	89469	2.0	Certainly imaginative . . . but it's perplexing instead of exciting	Fantasy story from screenwriter William Hjortsberg has powerful , evil Darkness plotting to overtake Light , personified in unicorns . An eyeful to be sure , but occasionally heavy or silly , with Tom Cruise dreadfully out of place in this Grimm-like setting playing commoner Jack in love with princess Mia Sara . Cruise quickly rebounded from this Ridley Scott-directed misfire , the European version of which runs some twenty minutes longer and features a different score ( they got Jerry Goldsmith , the U . S . got Tangerine Dream - - which wasn't a bad trade-off ) . Still , the film's murky narrative renders much of the proceedings incomprehensible , although portions of it are indisputably pretty to look at . from
552262	989035	87988	3.0	No sting in forgettable Farrah vehicle . . .	This TV film , about an attorney trying to nab a crooked kingpin by purchasing a House of Ill Repute , was appropriately ignored upon its debut and today is hardly recalled . It must have dampened Farrah Fawcett's spirit to slip this dumb thing in between her off-Broadway show " Extremities " and the landmark TV drama " The Burning Bed " . She was trying so hard at this point to change Hollywood's flossy image of her that anticipating reactions to " The Burning Bed " must have been nerve-wracking . " The Red-Light Sting " gets off to a wan start , but does improve by the third act . Still , it's just cop-drama nonsense , offering nothing new or exciting , while all of Fawcett's best work lay just ahead of her . Good supporting cast includes Beau Bridges , Sunny Johnson in her final film appearance , Paul Burke from " Valley of the Dolls " , and Alex Henteloff who memorably co-starred with Fawcett years earlier in the " Night of the Strangler " episode of " Charlie's Angels " .
550506	989035	52293	3.0	Sleepwalking programmer . . .	Robert Mitchum stars in and developed the story for this popular drive-in entry about a moonshine family in the south harassed by U . S . treasurers and gangsters . Despite authentic locales and great hillbilly music , this B-flick is short on exciting action and long on dreary talk and character conflict . Stilted direction , wooden acting ( even by Bob ) , but the black-and-white cinematography is good despite the constant back-projection . Mitchum cuts his usual menacing-yet-cartoony good guy / bad guy presence , but there's no vitality to his character - - and no rapport between him and the other actors . Barely average , the film might have been good but needed a bigger budget , a stronger script , and a direction with tighter pacing . from
552384	989035	78767	3.0	Mean-spirited instead of scary , hammy instead of intense . . .	There's nobody in this haunted house movie who merits much interest . Not the brooding dad , the vacuous mom , the noisy kids , the terrified priest . It just doesn't work . You can't have a suspenseful get - out - of - the - house - it's - haunted flick with a bunch of dullards at the center . The opening moments , showing the early murders in the residence , aren't grisly but they are disturbing - - scarier than any of the bleeding walls or red-eyed pigs which come later . That's the thing these movie-makers haven't grasped : that a warped human condition is more terrifying than any of the supernatural nonsense they can cook up . Just as with the " non-fiction " cause celeb bestseller this is based upon , the movie is a scrap-heap of spooky clich√©s only frightening to the gullible . from
553541	989035	78350	3.0	" Bees ! Bees ! They're all around us ! Bees ! Bees ! "	Killer bees attack residents in a small town preparing for a flower festival . Fred MacMurray BEGS Olivia de Havilland to marry him and she looks to the heavens with an empathic , " Oh , how lucky I am ! " ( they both perish . ) When the train , packed full of stock characters , derailed , the theater audience I saw this with actually cheered ; too bad producer Irwin Allen wasn't aboard . This film ranks right up there with Allen's " When Time Ran Out . . . " , still to this day the reigning champ of bad cinema . The special effects are actually very good here , but the script is so lame and the direction so stilted that the results are not uneven so much as they are unintentionally funny . B-grade actors like Richard Chamberlain must've been mighty grateful for Irwin Allen's disaster films ( and the chance to work in big-budget productions ) , but that's no excuse for Michael Caine's limp appearance . Had Mel Brooks put his name on it , " The Swarm " might have been the top comedy of its year . from
552972	989035	70915	3.0	Reynolds fits like a glove in a tale of the sweaty South . . .	Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky , a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff . Laid-back Reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these ' good ol ' boy ' performances in ; true , he's on auto-pilot throughout . But in his day , Reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself . Ingratiating and handsome , Reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up ; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star , while director Joesph Sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the South alive . Unfortunately , the story isn't much , and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins overact ( as usual ) . Diane Ladd is fine in a small part , and real-life daughter Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background . Reynolds returned to this character for 1976's " Gator " . from
552412	989035	59453	3.0	Moody , curious , but ultimately unenthralling melodrama	Amnesiac James Garner tries to sort out his apparently complicated past . This adaptation of Evan Hunter's book " Buddwing " ( and retitled " Woman Without a Face " for its overseas release ) looks terrific but is a distressingly unsatisfying soaper . Photographed by the great Ellsworth Fredericks in crystalline black-and-white on autumnal New York City locations , the movie is saddled with an annoying plot which never comes together . Full of top talent , but only Suzanne Pleshette gives off some heat as a savvy actress . The film attempts to be modern and risqu√© , but the writing is so ham-handed and the direction so self-consciously arty that the final result just seems alienating and unabsorbing . from
551806	989035	50546	3.0	Robot-aficionados will love the hardware . . . but the script is a loss	Human players take a rightful backseat to incredible Robby the Robot , first introduced in 1956's " Forbidden Planet " . Scene-stealing Robby is cast as a mechanical playmate to Richard Eyer's young Timmie , but soon begins receiving diabolical orders from a power-crazed computer . Long outdated science-fiction nonsense will astound contemporary viewers with its naivet√© . Some see it as camp , some give it cult value . Production values just OK , dialogue and scenario wooden . If it weren't for Robby ( and the film's dynamic advertising campaign - - which matches nothing in the finished product ) , the film would not be remembered fondly today - - if at all . from
552968	989035	134630	3.0	Too-slick valentine to karaoke . . . with no vitality off the stage	Writer John Byrum and director Bruce Paltrow ostensibly had a good idea - - to catch the fever of semi-professional karaoke singers in action - - but maybe this subject might have been better served by a documentary . Byrum's hackneyed plots involving the troubled performers never take off , and Paltrow's staging of the musical numbers is far too slick . How much excitement can you work up when your karaoke singers are lip-synching ? Gwyneth Paltrow , playing a child-like woman who is reunited with her estranged father , is a lovely presence , yet hiding her intrinsically smart and savvy personality here does her no favors . The most surprising thing about the picture is that Paul Giamatti can carry a tune , although he's distinctly studio-enhanced , as if the producers were hoping to get a hit soundtrack out of this thing . Small wonder the movie flounders ; it's calculated and colorless . from
553668	989035	120746	3.0	Designed to give you whiplash . . . but who wants a slam-bang Zorro ?	The Zorro legend , slicked up with slam-bang , high-tech , expensive effects , so that it resembles an action-flick or a high-budget martial arts movie . Anthony Hopkins is surprisingly - - though nicely - - cast as an elderly Zorro passing his skills and knowledge ( not to mention his cape and mask ! ) onto a Latin fugitive who soon becomes a well-trained fighter for the people . The bad guys are hissable , heartless Spaniard officials , sadistic in a cartoonish manner much the same way Antonio Banderas ' new Zorro is dopey and yet dashing . There's plenty of sword fights and anachronistically modern jokes , a saucy sideline romance , and it is all very well-made but distressingly unsubtle . All the noisy action Hollywood can dream up can't help this " Zorro " escape the feeling there is no real personality at work . It's an epic , all right - - but only in generic terms . from
553480	989035	250720	3.0	Just the thing to kill off the motion picture once and for all . . .	Blatantly ridiculous . Decorated , heroic canine ( who apparently has the strength of a large man and understands the entire English language ) is separated from the FBI and ends up with an unwashed postal carrier and the little boy he's currently babysitting . David Arquette , talking like the first white hip-hop mailman , sputters about trying to be zany , and fares even worse when the paltry script suddenly requires him to be paternal to the kid ( who is either giggling or sulking ) . The sub-plot about mob boss Paul Sorvino putting out a hit on the dog actually provides the brightest moments , and hit-men Joe Viterelli and Steve Schirripa are able to come up with some funny repartee . Restless kids may go for it , and it isn't a completely shoddy production . from
552318	989035	102768	3.0	Artificial piece with a screwy message . . .	One of those high-budget , yet relentlessly schlocky movie-star vehicles which both pander and condescend to a mass audience ; the pedigree talent involved may well warrant a viewing , yet the film is so pompous it makes viewers feel like chumps for watching . Harrison Ford plays a slimy , self-absorbed lawyer whose life takes a drastic turn after he walks into a liquor store being robbed . Annette Bening plays Ford's spouse who helps her husband through a difficult period , and has a rebirth of her own . This is precisely the type of material director Mike Nichols would have thumbed his nose at twenty years ago ; working here rather joylessly , Nichols wraps all the phony uplift in cinematic Saran Wrap . The self-deceit ( and smugness ) hanging over the film is like a gray pallor . from

Unrefined shopgirl is pegged by a confidence couple to use as a lure for bilking wealthy men - - she hesitates for a moment , but is soon in cahoots with the wily twosome , that is until she falls for one of their victims : a bumbling ( and broke ) mathematician . Gene Tierney has some wonderful scenes at the beginning , bored with her job and ready to take an early powder , but there's nothing exciting about the man she loves ( he's more an overripe juvenile ) , and pretty soon the movie is going around in circles . There's a private detective who works for peanuts and yet has more information than the F . B . I . , not to mention an upscale gambling casino that becomes rigged at random . Henry Fonda , talking too loudly and over-enunciating , is stuck with the movie-world's most rotten concoction - - a penniless kid with principles who is too proud to accept easy money - - and he does nothing interesting with it . Might have been a far better picture if the love story were dropped , focusing primarily on salesgirl Tierney and her love-hate relationship with the con-artists . Film is easily summed up by one line of dialogue : " Eegads ! Did you ever see anything so corny ? " from
553646	989035	52529	4.0	Filmed in Wonderama !	Lou Costello ( sans Abbott ) plays a small town self-employed " rubbish collector " ( and the inventor of a time-controlling machine ! ) who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot . After a spat , Lou's girl ( Dorothy Provine ) runs into a misty cave - - why it's misty we never learn - - and emerges as a 30 foot giant . Provine is certainly a good sport , and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous ( it would've been impossible anyway ) , yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character , turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well . Provine bosses Costello around while creating havoc with the Army troops who get called in , but nothing funny is done with the transformation . Trumped by " Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman " the previous year , the film does feature Lou Costello in his final bow , but provides little else . The special effects are marginal , while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing . from
553424	989035	78034	4.0	Caustic comedy with leering , mean-spirited asides . . .	Two years before he wrote and directed " Arthur " , Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for Henry Winkler , then TV's " The Fonz " . A 1950s college thespian ( and all-around jerk ) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon ; to make ends meet , he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling , eventually becoming a " Gorgeous George " - like celebrity . Turning likable Winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time ( and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego ) , but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean , staged rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner . Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving Herv√© Villechaize ( of " Fantasy Island " ) putting the moves on Polly Holliday ( Flo from " Alice " ) . As Henry's beloved , Kim Darby looks a little out of her element - - particularly when surrounded by all these TV hams - - rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential . from

Teen physics whiz ( played by Michelle Trachtenberg , a Scarlett Johansson lookalike with a gorgeous crop of brunette hair ) takes up ice-skating at the local rink as a means of studying kinetic energy - - pretty soon , she's donning a leotard and performing in a pageant ! The downside is , smart girls never get the guys - - although a Mark Ruffalo lookalike who works at the rink just loves Trachtenberg's scientific babbling . Disney film for young girls hasn't a whiff of originality , with a bland sense of humor and snotty , slangy Lolita wanna-bes on the ice . As Trachtenberg's mom , Joan Cusack acts like she's ready for the Motion Picture Retirement Home , however Kim Cattrall's work as the hard-nosed skating coach isn't bad until the character is turned into a formula cutthroat . Tr√®s harsh ! from
550638	989035	61173	4.0	Moderately amusing for about half its length . . .	In the 1990s , the U . S . Air Force wants to send a newlywed couple into outer space to live on the moon in a space-station for a year ; after the first couple drops out , alternate Jerry Lewis is chosen , but he's a bachelor . . . enter Connie Stevens as a prospective bride . Good-looking Jerry Lewis vehicle is amusingly naive about the future , and yet frustratingly silly regarding sexual matters ( Walt Disney's " Moon Pilot " from 1961 was actually much friskier ! ) . Lewis is more restrained than usual , Stevens ( despite an odd , helium-sounding speaking voice ) is effervescent , and the art direction and decoration is a ' 60s dream ( complete with clear plastic inflatable furniture ! ) . But the script completely peters out once the couple gets launched , and a couple of dreary sub-plots involving bachelors-in-space Dennis Weaver and Howard Morris and sexy Russian cosmonaut Anita Ekberg fail to rouse any laughs . from
550675	989035	60726	4.0	The Munster family in " living " color . . .	Theatrical farewell to Herman , Lily , Grandpa and the gang features many of the same talents behind the popular 1960s television show " The Munsters " , but this misadventure seems a little bereft of imagination - - perhaps a laugh-track might have helped ? The ghoulish clan inherits a British estate , and Herman gets involved in a slapstick auto race . Debby Watson is the one newcomer to the cast ( taking over for Pat Priest as niece Marilyn ) , though not even jovial Fred Gwynne and glinty-eyed Al Lewis can raise this script from the crypt . Maybe filming the family in color was a technical error - - it takes the edge off the Universal / monster movie satire which the TV show nailed without effort . This one strains for laughs , and ends on a whimper . from
551621	989035	59916	4.0	Another " Beach Party " knock-off without the comedy , the chemistry , or the charm . . .	Columbia Pictures dipping deep into their teen bag , coming up with little more than a running advertisement for Coke and James Stacy in a series of ski fashions for men . Ultra clean-cut tale concerns a young man hiring entertainment ( ski bunnies ) and a work crew ( a cook and a soda-jerk ) to work at a mountain lodge which he recently inherited ; his buddy promotes the place by putting a detour sign in the road and redirecting traffic their way . No script , no talent , no witty repartee - - these dull ' kids ' are a lazy lot . There's a pretty good fight scene in the chalet , a groovy wedding tag , and some mind-boggling musical numbers ( psychedelic-sweater wearing foursome the Reflections croon a ridiculous ditty about sugary sweets while the bunnies pass out huge lollipops to the guests ! ) . The dramatic tension in the plot is served by having two of the guests on secret assignment to ruin the place ; the comedy comes after embarrassed-to-be-up-here Stacy worms his way into a gig as a ski-instructor and attempts to get into a young lady's bedroom at night ( he trips the alarm and feigns sleepwalking ! ) . This is another case of a major studio trying to ape the low-brow teens-on-their-own genre begun a few years before with A . I . P . ' s " Beach Party " . It isn't too awful , but nobody here shows any pizazz , nor any individual style ; most of the girls try too hard for cute perkiness while the guys play aw-shucks with the women and big brother with each other . On the other hand , those Suzuki motorbikes are coolness defined . from
552614	989035	94321	4.0	If she screamed " Louden ! ! " one more time . . .	An ear-splitting movie . Madonna goes way out on an acting limb here , playing a beyond-vivacious parolee out to nab the scum who framed her and sent her to prison . After an energetic animated credits sequence - - which is much more fun than the rest of the movie - - we have nothing to look at but Madonna's black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion . What else is there ? Griffin Dunne seems deflated and defeated playing Madonna's keeper and the poor-choice supporting cast struggle for laughs which just aren't there . This picture hurt my teeth . However , and I say this without malice , Madonna is a better actress than I thought . She takes a wretched role and manages to pump some life into the thing . Too bad it is such a mean-spirited movie , we are driven not to love her but to wish somebody on-screen would tell this girl to shut up . from
553221	989035	52198	4.0	Over-simplified , over-eager . . . but at least it looks good	Teen idol Tommy Sands never got as popular as his Virgil Walker character is here ( and if he did , it lasted about a minute ) . Too bad then that his acting chops couldn't compensate for a lack of chart hits . Young man goes from tent-revivals to teen king , but when a funeral back home beckons , his priorities change . Cinemascoped affair has beautiful b & w photography and just enough melodrama to help it over the finish line , but it's awfully flimsy . Perhaps Elvis Presley's life story was a starting point for original writer Paul Monash ( who later had a hand in 1976's " Carrie " ! ) , but Tommy Sands , although energetic , isn't up to Presley's standards ( maybe Ricky Nelson's ) . He's got a handsome face and a gorgeous crop of greasy black hair ( like Presley's ) , but when his adolescent voice squeaks in rebellion , one almost wants to duck for cover .
552704	989035	59798	4.0	Teeth-gnashingly ' kooky '	Screen-adaptation of the Broadway hit grinds itself into the ground with a firm belief that kooky equals lovable , and vice-versa . It's tough to love anything here , particularly Jason Robards ' performance as a life-loving eccentric ( here we go ) who is investigated by authorities to see if he's a proper guardian for his live-in nephew ( played by Barry Gordon as a wizened little wiseass ) . A grueling piece of work . Martin Balsam won a Supporting Oscar playing Robards ' brother ; perhaps the Academy was just giving a fine actor his due . Had to be , because this brand of arms-flailing theatrics and sub-Neil Simon / jokey dialogue shows off no one to their best advantage . Helped a bit by the decent black-and-white cinematography , and by Barbara Harris ' innate grace . from
553142	989035	51732	4.0	Tentative and tepid . . .	Jean Simmons as a mentally fragile woman returning home to her dysfunctional family after a stay in an institution . Simmons , a very samey actress , played a lot of these troubled types , women with see-sawing emotions ( and the other characters ' reactions to her are always the same in every circumstance : shock or surprise at her indignation at being treated like a patient , and using her bursts of coherent anger against her as proof that she's still not right in the head ) . The picture , beautifully filmed in black-and-white on atmospheric New England locations , is unfortunately stuck on some kind of dreary merry-go-round , with Simmons seeing the insanity around her but unable to pinpoint it to others . When you have only one character on-screen pulling for herself , struggling against a tide of absurdities , the results can be frustrating . Director Mervyn LeRoy is sensitive to the heroine , and writers Eileen and Robert Bassing are exceptionally careful with this provocative milieu ( and , to their credit , the film isn't dated from a medical standpoint ) , but the movie hasn't much to say about mental incapacitation ; its goal ultimately is to be a tough soaper for female audiences ( with Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . as a possible Prince ) . from
551373	989035	86050	4.0	Derivative , PG-rated shocker for pre-teens . . .	Threadbare horror outing has an innocent teen ( Meg Tilly , appealing as always ) attempting to get in good with the popular clique at school ( despite the fact they seem to hate her outright ) and letting herself be subjected to their sorority-like initiation : spending the night in a creepy mausoleum . Despite the complete absence of originality , this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances ( particularly by Robin Evans , oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls ) . The script isn't razor sharp , but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings somewhat bearable . from
550849	989035	114478	4.0	Improvisational drama without much on its mind . . .	Character-oriented piece from director Wayne Wang centering on the owner of a New York-based smoke shop , his offbeat client√®le and assorted colorful friends . Heavily improvisational - - yet only intermittently interesting - - " Smoke " managed to create a small cult with audiences and critics , although neither the actors nor Paul Auster ( the credited screenwriter ) have anything important to say . It's imperative in a talking-heads movie like this to create a beguiling inner-sanctum , a small universe within this store with its rapidly changing groups , but Wang only gets strong scenes out of Harvey Keitel and Ashley Judd . Some interesting bits and pieces ( and a moving finish ) make the picture worthwhile for art-films fans . Followed by the sequel " Blue In The Face " in 1995 . from
550616	989035	149691	4.0	Phony star-driven vehicle . . .	Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior . Apart from several good sequences , I didn't quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake ( she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady ) , and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent . Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid , and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work ( and some of her scenes , such as the one where she asks a boy to strip , are misguided and uncomfortable to watch ) . Certainly not an incompetent piece , " Anywhere But Here " does have moments that work , but it isn't an embraceable film , nor has it proved to be an important one . from
551354	989035	111094	4.0	Some good one-liners in asinine comic set-up	Albert Brooks co-wrote and stars in this sometimes-bright but terribly unsubtle comedy about a talent scout for the New York Yankees who loses his reputation after getting a skittish college Freshman signed to the team ( the Yankees apparently scheduled the kid to pitch in a televised game without any training or pre-game publicity whatsoever , so don't they get what they deserve ? ) ; Brooks is banished to South Central Mexico to find talent , and yet when he comes up with another promising pitcher , he's fired over the telephone ( in one of those excruciating sitcom developments the movie occasionally falls prey to ) . The new pitcher ( Brendan Fraser , still in " Encino Man " mode ) is a child in a young man's body , thereby linking the scout and the player on an emotionally-needy basis ( not solid ground for laugh-out-loud comedy ) . Brooks as an actor is very ingratiating - - he always has been - - but this material , despite some very amusing one-liners , is stale , highly concocted , and immature . Many real-life sports luminaries appear in cameos . . . perhaps they should have been allowed to strengthen the script . from
551611	989035	113321	5.0	Should've been great . . .	Jodie Foster's second film as director shows her faltering a bit from her debut with the moving , funny " Little Man Tate " . Working with an uneven script that is better in its straight dramatic moments than as a comedy , Foster can't get a realistic rhythm going between the disgruntled family members at this Thanksgiving reunion . Every scene involving Geraldine Chaplin as a neurotic aunt is a loss , and Robert Downey , Jr . is awful as the obnoxious gay brother of Holly Hunter . Hunter usually gives flaccid scripts like this a little boost , but even her timing is off ( especially in the early introductory scenes , which don't work at all ) . Finally , as if the clouds parted and clarity shined through , the movie picks up in its final twenty minutes . There's a scathing scene between the sisters ( " If I met you on the street - - if you gave me your number - - I'd throw it away " ) and Charles Durning's remembrance of his family at the airport is wonderfully wistful . I also admired the final arty shots showing the past and the present ( with the camera circling madly , joyfully ) , and then a crystal clear shot of a plane descending into the velvet sky . Are these moving moments enough to justify the glut of an otherwise overwrought picture ? Almost . from
552183	989035	60818	5.0	Plush budget but a thin plot . . .	Natalie Wood finally gets a comedy vehicle all to herself , but the results are half-cocked . Crafty woman conspires to rob her husband's bank - - perhaps because she needs love or attention - - and that's the entire plot in a nutshell . It's dragged out for 97 minutes . Natalie and the supporting cast ( colorful players like Peter Falk and Jonathan Winters ) have , understandably , very little to work with , though the production values are plush and some of the comedy is breezy and amusing . Director Arthur Hiller mistakes broadly staged gags for funny set-pieces , and most often the movie is just silly . As for Natalie Wood , she provides what interest there is , she looks great ( and sings beautifully ! ) , but the entire film rests on her shoulders and it's not in her to carry the load alone . from
550762	989035	70022	5.0	Uneasy and uneven	A stylish direction by James William Guercio - - his only film ! - - and classy Conrad Hall cinematography cannot quite redeem wayward story about a motorcycle cop in Arizona , tired of busting hippies on the highway , chancing upon a corpse and seeing it as his ticket into the Homicide Division . About 45 minutes into the film , the assured tone goes a little batty and we're not sure where the movie is going . The middle portion of the picture , with Mitchell Ryan overdoing it as a psychotic detective , is weak and unpleasant , and the conclusion - - while thoughtfully presented - - is nonetheless predictable ( rather self-consciously directed towards an " Easy Rider " reversal ) . Robert Blake is excellent in the lead , although his character's transformation midway into a stooge just doesn't wash . from
551565	989035	69736	5.0	Gossamer plastic surgery fantasy . . .	" Ash Wednesday " opens with a series of sepia-toned , fabricated photographs putting a young , glamorous Elizabeth Taylor together with a lean , dark-haired Henry Fonda ; it's a great credits-sequence , well pulled off , until we find out that all this fancy living has taken its toll on poor Liz , portraying a lawyer's wife from Detroit ( couldn't they aim higher than that ? ) . Figuring plastic surgery is the only way to win back her estranged husband's love , Taylor checks into a Swiss medical resort and receives a full-body lift , later trading in her gauze and bandages for Valentino wraps and elaborate fur ensembles for a vacation at the local chalet . There's nothing remotely engaging about this scenario , except to see La Liz in a series of delectable wardrobe changes . We know that when Fonda arrives and sees her , nothing will be different ( this is telegraphed far in advance ) . The picture was probably ahead of its time in depicting the vanity in men as well as in women , but Taylor and Fonda have a tough time creating actual characters ( the writing being hardly more than a sketch ) . Liz has a nice moment asking Fonda to sing with her as they walk home , also a strong scene arguing with her daughter ( Margaret Blye , who is well-cast ; her eyes are almost as beautiful as Taylor's ) . But this fairy-tale-that-isn't hasn't much to offer aside from its surface attributes , which are photographed in a maddening series of subdued colors . from
550546	989035	52933	5.0	What happened to Jane ? ( not much )	One of Doris Day's few disappointments . The perky freckle-face is effervescent as usual playing small-town widow with two kids and a lobster business who is wooed by both long-time friend and lawyer Jack Lemmon and handsome but stolid reporter Steve Forrest . A bald Ernie Kovacs has the film's most colorful role as slimy , cigar-chomping railroad tycoon who tries muscling into Day's lobster action . Aside from some beautiful shots of trains and Doris interacting with a troop of Boy Scouts , this light-hearted whimsy fails to sparkle . It's slow and thinly plotted , and the child actors are badly cast ( particularly the pig-tailed tyke playing Day's daughter , who looks like The Bad Seed ) . Kovacs ' hamming - - and the faint whiff of chemistry between Doris and Jack - - almost makes " It Happened To Jane " worthwhile . from
552675	989035	113451	5.0	" Basic Instinct " replay ; almost a guilty pleasure	Assistant District Attorney in San Francisco investigates when a shady art dealer is murdered . Director William Friedkin is on auto-pilot with this silly retread of " Basic Instinct " , however the dynamics of the plot tend to draw you in against your better judgment . The car stunts are fabulous , most of the actors are sultry eye-candy , elfin-faced David Caruso is admirably commanding , but the plot doesn't bear close scrutiny . Friedkin's porny scenes ( which played havoc with the film's rating ) walk that cinematic line between being necessary and just being exploitive ( see " Lipstick " . . . and just about every movie written by this film's screenwriter , Joe Eszterhaus ) . " Jade " isn't despicable , but it leaves the viewer in the uncomfortable position of shameful voyeur , and while this may be titillating to some , it doesn't sit well in retrospect . from
552476	989035	113691	5.0	Good cast and director , but straightforward script and presentation are dull . . .	Seth Margolis ' novel becomes middle-of-the-road drama about a white woman and her husband fighting a black woman in court over the custody of the black woman's baby son , whom she left in a dumpster two years prior to cleaning up her life as a homeless crack-addict . Uninventive presentation plays like a dulled-out TV-movie , and the two leading actresses ( Jessica Lange and Halle Berry ) , while well cast , can't do much more than fill these stock roles with their individual charisma and personalities ( they can't invest much heart into the proceedings when the screenplay is all processed emotion ) . The outcome of the case ( and the reasons for the outcome ) seem dated already , and the concluding events are standard , predictable scenes of coming to terms . from
551281	989035	44557	5.0	" You'll have nice things , Nell , you're a handsome woman ! "	Unintentionally funny B-movie from Fox was Marilyn Monroe's first starring role ( a year before " Niagra " ) ; she plays a delusional , pathetic young woman just out of a mental institution who ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple's child one night in a posh New York hotel . Richard Widmark takes a shine to her , until he realizes she's " satin on one side and sandpaper on the other ! " Widmark's ex-girlfriend Anne Bancroft - - making a decent film debut - - has some funny lines too ( to Widmark : " I'm not angry - - I'm only furious ! " ) . Pulpy concoction , weak on action , has a few strong scenes : Monroe flirting with Widmark using the hotel window blinds , Monroe's final ride in the elevator , and any scene with Jim Backus as the kid's father . The director allows Marilyn to get away with too much , and when her eyes fire up with deranged hatred , she's really something to behold - - but in an amusing way that does this not-too-suspenseful melodrama no favors . from
552159	989035	86593	5.0	Slow-going human drama looks like a well-produced episode from a TV serial . . .	Kate Nelligan , always a forthright and gripping actress , gets to show many different sides as a single mother in New York City whose little boy disappears one day while walking a short distance to school ; she clashes with authorities and friends , but is convinced her child has been kidnapped and is still alive . These type of human dramas are all pretty much the same , but if the extremities pull you in , they are undeniably absorbing . There's a horribly facetious sub-plot about a homosexual suspect ( who seems to be rendered guilty by virtue of his fetishes ) , but Nelligan gives the familiar theme her class and ladylike vigor , making it fresher than most , and she's helped by other good actors like Judd Hirsch , Stockard Channing and David Dukes . The film is ultimately hurt by its clich√©s ( especially when dealing second-handedly with police lieutenant Hirsch's family life ) ; and as for the climax , it'll either strike you as very emotional or incredibly hokey and over-the-top . from
553415	989035	95174	5.0	Hampered by uneven direction , but featuring two fine performances . . .	After his wife is kidnapped from their Paris hotel room , a confused and distraught American doctor is plunged into European espionage . Rather mild suspense-thriller from director / co-writer Roman Polanski , who sets up the pieces to this chess match quite awkwardly . The opening moments with Harrison Ford and spouse Betty Buckley have little believability ( they seem like brother and sister ) , but the pacing does pick up from there , despite the fact that Ford's doctor is seldom charismatic or likable and is mainly just a plot device ( the worried husband ) . Newcomer Emmanuelle Seigner ( later Mrs . Polanksi ) is tantalizing as a young woman who gets involved , and her scenes with Ford give the picture some much-needed energy . from
552053	989035	95088	5.0	TV sitcom masquerading as a feature film	Elvira ( Cassandra Peterson ) is a very chipper presence on the screen , but her dry comments and costumed-Valley Girl disposition can't carry a movie very far . The plot - - something to do with an inheritance , a book of spells , and Edie McClurg as a Mrs . Kravitz-type townsperson - - isn't painful or slack , but it is extremely slight . . . and the horny teenage boys who keep trying to get a peek at Elvira's bazooms are like refugees from " Porky's 3 " . There's also a hunky love-interest for Elvira , but he doesn't seem especially like the type of guy she would go for ( since when do ghouls get worked up over all-American beefcake ? ) . It all leads to an FX-induced showdown and a finale in Las Vegas , but the real laugh-getter is Elvira and she's funny when she gets the chance . from
551050	989035	51818	5.0	Michael Curtiz directed , but it's no " Casablanca " for Elvis . . .	Disappointing Presley-fest has Elvis cast as a young delinquent who becomes involved with gangsters who hang out at a popular nightclub . Adapted from the Harold Robbins book " A Stone for Danny Fisher " , the movie transplants the action from Chicago to New Orleans and is now structured as an acting / singing vehicle for EP , here trying out his James Dean impression . Not badly done : the cinematography is vivid and there's good supporting work from Dean Jagger , Vic Morrow and the always-reliable Walter Matthau , but the women ( Carolyn Jones and Dolores Hart ) aren't well-used or interesting . Not particularly an intriguing melodrama , and not nearly as gritty as it might've been , but still worth noting for Presley's appearance and his songs , the title tune and " Trouble " . from
553213	989035	79489	5.0	The Count flips the Bird . . .	Rude , snorting satirical updating of Bram Stoker's legendary vampire . George Hamilton is perfect as Count Vladimir Dracula , here being forced out of his castle in Transylvania , pulling up stakes with bug-eating companion Renfield and moving to New York City in search of a model he's developed a yen for . Despite a cheapjack feel , this salty comedy begins brightly , with a needling sense of fun , but it goes south in the third act . Richard Benjamin is way over-the-top as a psychiatrist and relative of Van Helsing's , Dick Shawn looks lost as a soft-hearted Lieutenant , and the gaggle of stereotypical supporting characters are alternately amateurish , offensive , and overwrought . Susan St . James ' supermodel is crassly written , but she's game and pulls it off , even though there's practically no chemistry between she and Hamilton ( they just trade quips ) . George is wonderful however , and his delight at reveling in such gross material is infectious . from
551390	989035	44081	5.0	Missing some of the electricity and unpredictability of a live performance . . .	A deluded Southern belle goes to stay with her pregnant sister and her swaggering brute of a brother-in-law in their tacky New Orleans flat , but his pent-up passion and the belle's fluttery innocence / insanity clash in dramatic and sexual ways . Vivien Leigh is exceptional as quixotic , somewhat irritating Blanche DuBois , and this highly-theatrical material only comes to life cinematically when she is on the screen . Talk-heavy Tennessee Williams play seems a bit smoothed over , with the breathy lines of unreal dialogue occasionally landing with a literate clatter . Personal taste will have to decide whether the writer's penchant for melodramatic speeches and irrational behaviors are touching , theatrically-charged , or just perverse ( sometimes they are all three ) . It's a beautifully filmed piece , and with Oscar-winner Leigh as Blanche it is nearly a success . However , Marlon Brando ( as tortured Stanley Kowolski ) works and works at carving out his character with such angst that he may leave some viewers cold . Arduous , occasionally intriguing and involving but also extremely heavy-going . Remade twice for television , in 1984 and 1995 . from
552613	989035	79576	5.0	Their futures were foretold at the conclusion of the original . . .	So why did we need " More " ? It must've been a corporate decision - - with financial gain the bottom line . If so , that plan didn't quite work , as " More American Graffiti " failed to catch on with its target audience , mostly due to the fact it reflects not the 1960s but TV sitcoms derived from ' 60s nostalgia . Ron Howard and Cindy Williams ' story plays like a " Happy Days " rerun with bad language , however Charles Martin Smith's Vietnam episode is vividly captured - - and the idea of him trying to blow off his own arm in order to get back home says more about the war than " The Deer Hunter " did in three hours . Paul LeMat has some good scenes flirting with a pretty Swede , while Candy Clark kicks around as a kooky hippie . The film , produced by George Lucas , is full of colorful distractions : multi-image cinematography , constant period music on the soundtrack , and lots of overacting . Unfortunately , nothing can distract from the laziness of the writing , nor from the film's somewhat tiring concept ( which feels awfully gimmicky ) . The episodes aren't shaped with much thoughtfulness , and the film is insensitive and preconceived . from
553630	989035	41931	5.0	Bergman is miscast , yet film is endlessly fascinating . . .	Peculiar , curious enterprise involving spoiled Lithuanian woman in a WWII Italian camp who begrudgingly marries a poor Italian fisherman ; after moving with him to the remote island Stromboli , the woman encounters hostility from the locals , abuse from her spouse , and plots her escape . Melodramatic material served as Ingrid Bergman's first feature with director Roberto Rossellini , with whom Bergman ran away with in real-life ( leaving her husband behind , which sullied her reputation for almost six years ) . Banned nationwide , the film isn't very good but does have an ambiance that is unlike anything being turned out by American filmmakers during this period . The pacing is slow , the narrative murky , and there are two embarrassing scenes wherein Bergman is called upon to act like a tart , but cinema buffs should enjoy it . Shown in two versions : an 81-minute print and the longer 107-minute Italian cut which has a different ending . from
552857	989035	158371	5.0	Great-looking Woody Allen drama misfires without enough heart . . .	" Real life " jazz guitarist in the 1930s ( Sean Penn ) has alcohol , ego and marriage-related problems that keep him from tasting success . Woody Allen ( who appears as one of the narrators ) wrote and directed this handsome , certainly well-acted but meandering drama which always verges on being great but eventually comes up short . What begins as a lovely piece of yesteryear is undone by a maddeningly unmoving story and aloof characters ; it builds no emotion . Penn is fine if unexceptional in his complex role , but Samantha Morton is very lovely as a mute girl he gets involved with . Gorgeous music numbers , terrific production values , but eventually a misfire . from
552453	989035	89755	5.0	All the star-power and prestige cannot erase the air of artificiality . . .	Robert Redford is miscast as a British adventurer in Africa wooing married Danish writer Meryl Streep . Busy , overlong romantic opus / travelogue based upon the life of Karen Blixen is really just an excuse to get these two beautiful stars together on-screen , and certainly their combined chemistry makes several scenes quite memorable . Streep flourishes in this extravagant role , and Klaus Maria Brandauer is excellent as her rather hapless husband , but director Sydney Pollack allows his pacing to plod , and wooden Redford never livens up . It apparently impressed the Academy , winning Oscars for Pollack , Karl Luedtke for his screenplay adaptation , David Watkin for his admittedly lovely cinematography , Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Sound , John Barry for his score , and for Best Picture . from
551619	989035	87800	6.0	A rough little jewel	It's poorly-acted , sloppily-made and far too bloody , but the very first " Nightmare On Elm Street " spooked me at the time and has an ingenious premise : young teenaged girl finds that her friends are being killed in their dreams by a deceased child-killer seeking revenge ; she plots to trip him up and save the neighborhood ! It's a very modest thriller with fake blood splashed around , but it's not an ugly , mean movie ( as some of the sequels were ) . In fact , it's very playful and fun-scary , the way a good chiller ought to be . Director Wes Craven allows himself to get a little dopey ( check out that finale ! ) , but he takes some chances here that his recent work ( on the awful , too-slick " Scream " films ) rebuffs . Craven is working on pure adrenaline as well as a loopy , lopsided sense of logic , and this " BOO ! " sensibility suits him . It's a nifty little screamer .
551283	989035	61107	6.0	Despite incredible moments , a disappointment from the Master of Suspense	American nuclear scientist Paul Newman defects in East Germany , but is he serious or just setting the Germans up as pawns ? Espionage drama from director Alfred Hitchcock , with Julie Andrews a curious choice as the proverbial girlfriend ( she was forced upon Hitch by the head of Universal ) . The production is extremely plush - - too plush for the gritty on-screen happenings . Some of the set-ups have that carpeted , artificial Hollywood look that doesn't do much for the players on-screen nor the audience . The screenplay is heavy with talk , and Hitchcock can't shake out the cobwebs ; the pacing is dirge-like most of the way . Newman and Andrews give just-OK lead performances , but there are the requisite pleasures in such a film , particularly one colorful murder scene involving an oven . Not a memorable film by any means , but passable for Hitchcock completists . from
550978	989035	35567	6.0	Affable teaming of two high-powered stars , though better things were in store . . .	First screen-teaming of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn peaks too early , and unconscionably trades in its salty wit for silly screwball laughs in the final reel , but fans of both stars should have a good time . A gruff columnist and a political writer meet and soon marry , but her hectic schedule puts an immediate crimp in the romance department . Though I'm sure the characters were eventually tailored for the leads , the charisma comes directly from Tracy and Hepburn the actors - - not really from the couple they're portraying . The jocular tone of the picture seems a little off and , in the final stretch when Kate decides to be wife-like and cook breakfast , the movie turns into a cartoon put-down of emancipated women ( although the staging of her kitchen calamities is still pretty funny ) . Some fine scenes , but better movies were just around the corner . from
552378	989035	52896	6.0	Anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree plant !	Adaptation of Arnold Schulman's play about feckless Miami Beach widower with a young son who needs a fast loan to save his ramshackle hotel , considering the idea of marrying into money with a shy ( but beautiful ) young widow . Slick , but not very moving comedy-drama won an Oscar for the memorable tune " High Hopes " , but - - with Frank Sinatra , Edward G . Robinson , and Eleanor Parker in the cast - - it should have been much better . The youngster is played by sharp , yet Hollywood-smart Eddie Hodges , who is decent with the kind of lines concocted for him . Frank Capra directed , weakly . Some good scenes , but it runs too long and has too few jokes . from
552406	989035	43012	6.0	Features famous " Get Happy " number . . . and lots of padding	Theater people invade Judy Garland's farm ; they want to put on a show in her barn , but will she let her guard down long enough to join them on stage ? Since the picture opens with Garland in a musical sequence ( performing " If You Feel Like Singing " , this film's title overseas ) and the information is dropped early on that her property is in dire straits financially , the answer ( and the entire plot ) is fairly obvious . Some of the numbers are wonderful , particularly the justifiably famous " Get Happy " show-stopper , but several just pad the running-time and the screenplay is second-hand stuff . Gene Kelly does an ingenious bit dancing with a newspaper , but his dumb yokel act with Phil Silvers is excruciating , as is their pseudo-gospel number " Dig For Your Dinner " . from
552152	989035	79261	6.0	" Tooby ooby wala / nooby aba naba / early morning singing song . . . "	Michael Butler's Broadway musical " Hair " from 1967 was an unqualified success which spawned pop-oriented hit singles from its score . Milos Forman's movie version was critically-acclaimed ( Roger Ebert named it the best film of the year ) , but it looked out of place in 1979 . With disco fading and punk rock and New Wave moving in , not many moviegoers were interested in harking back to " The Age of Aquarius " . A pity , since Forman's movie shows that there was something deeper and more meaningful to the show than what was initially publicized ( the hippies , the nudity , etc . ) . A straight-arrow on his way into the Army is befriended by a gang of free-living , free-loving young people ; their leader , a rebellious , incredulous sort who doesn't understand the purpose of ( or need for ) authority , tries to open his new friend's mind . Forman doesn't shape individual scenes to get an impact - - he's always looking at the big picture . This approach backfires in regards to some of the musical numbers , which either aren't well edited ( " Hair " ) , feel incongruous ( " Black Boys / White Boys " ) , or don't seem to have a great deal of relevancy ( " Walking in Space " ) . Screenwriter Michael Weller occasionally pushes everyone aside in order to invent new dramatic situations , which leaves the middle portion of the film feeling a little draggy . Still , the cast ( albeit a much older group of actors than one might hope for ) is solid , and the film's art direction is uncannily accurate . The LSD / wedding-fantasy sequence misfires , and the anti-war performance piece held near the Washington Monument fails to make much of an impression . Yet the tricky irony of the finale is rather well-done , and when a musical moment is welcomed ( such as " Good Morning Starshine " ) , it can work brilliantly . from
553595	989035	51406	6.0	A rather staid and stuffy situation-comedy	Kim Novak , the " Lavender Lady " , trades in her purple chiffon for witchy black in this glossy , but not very crafty , witchcraft comedy . James Stewart is Novak's new neighbor and , unaware of her powers , gets lured into her trap . . . but can he teach her what true love is really about ? Jack Lemmon has the brightest moments as a happy-go-lucky warlock , but there's really no character there ; Lemmon gets laughs strictly by winging it . " Vertigo " co-stars Novak and Stewart have a terrible time trying to create chemistry . Some smoldering smoke arises , but no real sparks . When the stars have to try this hard , the effort is noticeable and the picture falls down around them , like an expensive souffle .
553020	989035	51429	6.0	A curiously passive , unmoving experience . . .	Wealthy playboy father and his precocious seventeen-year old daughter share a sassy , flirty relationship with one another while teasing and leading-on potential romantic partners for both . But the fun and games are called to a halt once dad is reunited with an old friend of the family , a chic fashion designer who would like to see both father and daughter get serious about their lives . Talented writer Arthur Laurents adapted his screenplay from Fran√ßoise Sagan's book , yet even with Otto Preminger directing a classy cast , this soaper set on the Riviera never comes to a boil . Preminger sees the idle rich as spoiled and decadent , dancing away mindlessly into the night , yet the players ( David Niven and gamine Jean Seberg as father and daughter , Deborah Kerr as Niven's fianc√©e ) bring a lot more heart and human interest to the piece than was probably intended . As such , the characters are more embraceable than the writing and handling , and portions of the film are puzzling or awkward . Still , film-lovers of this era in cinema will no doubt bask in the lush surroundings , not to mention in the enjoyable performances and beautiful photography ( black-and-white for the present day , color for the past ) . The script might have benefited from more honesty in the finale - - the ' irony ' in bringing these dead-end lives full circle isn't very cutting - - and there are two supporting characters who are given the shaft by Laurents . There are certainly pleasures to be had here , however , most notably in the scenes between Kerr and Seberg . from
551233	989035	59729	6.0	A slender plot , spiked by jazzy visuals and snappy Poitier performance	A college student who volunteers one night a week at a crisis help center receives a call from a woman who has just taken an overdose of barbiturates . . . can he keep her on the line long enough for the police to find and rescue her ? Slim plot puffed up with importance by director Sydney Pollack , making his feature film debut ; Pollack opens the picture with a dizzying array of overhead shots of Seattle , presumably to help us get our bearings for where we are and who the main players are , but with Quincy Jones madly changing music cues in the background , it becomes an unintentionally silly set-piece . Sidney Poitier plays the student with a nimble mix of concern , panic and irritation , and only occasionally is he encouraged to overdo it ( Pollack certainly doesn't help , giving us too many extreme close-ups of Poitier wild-eyed and sweating ) . Anne Bancroft is the troubled wife and mother whose world is crashing down around her ( actually , it's just her marriage ) and I'm not sure what we're meant to get out of the glimpses of her working life ( Bancroft asks a co-worker to go to lunch , and when the girl says she's busy Bancroft appears terribly wounded - - doesn't she have any other acquaintances who care about her ? and what about her relationship with her boss , which sounds one-sided-flirtatious ? ) . Bancroft , with a big crop of wavy hair , is weighed down by this woeful role and she's forced into looking shell-shocked most of the time , though there is one scene - - the hospital waiting room - - where she gets to break character a bit and gets a wicked gleam in her eye . The movie is well-paced and is full of visual accoutrements , but one wonders about that ending and what exactly was solved . from
553242	989035	36855	6.0	Uneven ( but Oscar-winning ! ) Ingrid Bergman performance	In Victorian London , a young woman is being driven mad by her own husband , who hopes to find the whereabouts of some hidden jewels . Thin plot given gossamer treatment by overrated director George Cukor ; Cukor knows a great many things on how to showcase an actress , but he doesn't handle the men quite as well and his attention to plot details is murky . In the lead , Ingrid Bergman is highly uneven . With the camera so close on her face , Bergman is forced to feign and swoon continuously under the eye of the audience , and it's a gambit that doesn't pay off ( one is simply too aware of the actress's tics to feel the full tension of the plot ) . Some suspense is delivered , but Cukor relieves the atmosphere of tautness through his lack of control over the scenario . from
551196	989035	201128	6.0	Inconsistently developed and predictable . . . but with pleasant moments and a star-turn from La Fawcett	Lawrence Naumoff's book turned into a sketchy , meandering vehicle for star Farrah Fawcett , playing a ne'er-do-well good-time girl who pops into her rural hometown only to find she's missed her beloved mama's funeral and that her sister is planning to sell off the old homestead . She decides to work at the local factory and buy sis out , and catches the eye of the hunky foreman ( who looks like a clean-shaven Kris Kristofferson in his youth ) . Up to this point , the TV-made " Silk Hope " has some drive and a rousing character in Fawcett's Frannie Vaughn , but though the dialogue is smart and has a truthful edge , the plot manages to get all balled up . Frannie is supposed to be flighty and irrational , but how she thinks making pocket change at the factory ( or starting a pig farm ) will help her win the house back is never explained . When Farrah digs deep as an actress , she's more than capable of bringing out a forthright woman who doesn't take baloney from anybody , but too often here she slips into a little girl act ( with a light , tinkly voice ) ; in her quieter moments she's very good , and very attractive ( if rail-thin ) , and she's really the only reason to watch the movie . The bumpy narrative darts about from one half-finished sequence to the next , including the proverbial county fair , the emergency at the factory , a crisis in the family , a hunt for Daddy who's been missing for ages , and Frannie standing up to her bosses at work as if she were Eleanor Roosevelt . It just doesn't wash , but then it probably wasn't meant to be an incisive , dramatic entertainment . . . just a piece of fluff .
553374	989035	44357	6.0	" I know how to get things out of people . . . "	Jean Simmons doesn't exactly have the face of an angel , but that doesn't mean she's miscast in " Angel Face " ; on the contrary , Simmons ' hard , placid neuroses get a worthy workout in this glossy noir , turning the film's title into an ironic gag . Even though Simmons is not a juicy or sympathetic villainess , she's a compelling one , and director Otto Preminger gets an even-keeled , non-campy performance from her . Robert Mitchum is typically sturdy as a shallow stud , an ambulance driver in Los Angeles who is swayed by the step-daughter of a wealthy socialite ; she wants to be his benefactor and his lover , but when her plans are spoiled she quietly seethes and plots . Complicated drama is absorbing and compelling , if infuriating and unpleasant . People like these most assuredly exist , but watching this no-win situation play out isn't exactly entertaining . Preminger turns the screws slowly and carefully , and while we're drawn in by the mechanisms of the plot , the characters are by turns heartless , selfish , thoughtless and contemptible . from
552776	989035	59487	6.0	Joey Heatherton : baby doll thespian !	One of our local TV channels used to show this movie frequently on the late show - - but not at all in the last 10 years , so it appears " My Blood Runs Cold " is another in the long line of forgotten ' 60s potboilers . Too bad , because it's dopey fun . Joey Heatherton proves she's quite the little thespian here , portraying swinging single meeting a strange young man who is convinced he was her lover in a past life ! Story is fairly tight , until the last reel when it begins to unravel . The chase-climax is straight off the assembly line . However , Joey is really charismatic here and had me glued to the screen . She overcomes the obvious exploitation angle director William Conrad takes and gives the picture a big boost . from
552410	989035	70794	6.0	Dryly humorous , engaging and well-cast . . .	Ryan O'Neal gives one of his better , looser performances in this crime-caper , a handsome comedy-drama involving a high society thief planning a major heist . Warren Oates is the investigator in dogged pursuit , Jacqueline Bisset ( at her most lovely ) plays a love-interest in on the action , Austin Pendleton is very funny as a nerdy chess pro , and wonderfully blithe Jill Clayburgh makes a big impression in the minor role of O'Neal's ex-wife . Engaging fluff with tongue wryly in cheek , well-directed by Bud Yorkin . Terrific non-think entertainment for cable-watchers , yet this did seem a little flat when it played in theaters . from
553167	989035	340012	6.0	" You have a performance for everyone - - I'm not sure you really exist ! "	Celebrated stage actress in 1930's West End London ( British by way of Jersey ) is tired of giving a nightly tour-de-force at her own theater and longs for something more ; she becomes involved with a young American gigolo , is counseled by the ghost of her dramatic tutor , and trades bits of business with her husband , who has become a partner in her career but not in her bed . Annette Bening does some savvy , colorful acting here , but the material is broadly-drawn , unsubtle and a bit distracting ( the viewer is seldom sure how to take the characters , especially at crucial points in the beginning , and since Julia is such a drama queen anyway , it's unclear how we're supposed to feel about her when she's hurting ) . The direction is so blandly smooth it makes an uncomfortable partner with the script , which doesn't quite give us the heady glimpse beyond the footlights that " All About Eve " did , although that is clearly its intention . Bening ultimately makes up for the shortcomings : she takes a while to find this character , and then has to decide how far to go with her , but her choices are uniformly correct and her close-up at the finale ( bemusement mixed with self-satisfaction and matter-of-fact calmness ) is a masterful touch . from
550629	989035	120787	6.0	Slick , glossy , shallow	Remake of Hitchcock's " Dial M For Murder " ( with a worse title ) has the unfaithful wife of a New York City businessman targeted for murder . Unsurprising twists in this updated version do allow Michael Douglas to play a mean SOB again ( after too many years of playing the victimized good guy ) , but the plot feels half-baked . Much of the movie seems to take place off-screen ; mostly what we get are fatuous red herrings and character contrivances . What's with all that linguistic talent Gwyneth Paltrow possesses ? What's the point ? . . . and when Gwyneth travels to the seedy side of town to try her key in a stranger's apartment , why does the editor cut away after she dramatically enters the building ? What does she find inside ? Why does she tell Douglas her intentions at the end , only to freeze against the door-jam when he tries to stop her ? " A Perfect Murder " isn't a dumb thriller , it's fairly tight and intriguing , and the performances are commendable , but it doesn't satisfy on a hearty level ( like Hitchcock ) . In fact , it ends with a whimper . from
551847	989035	120815	6.0	For war-movie aficionados , a personal epic . . .	Director Steven Spielberg's usual homey touch ( which infiltrated even " Schlinder's List " in its final act ) is thankfully in slight evidence here , as WWII soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat . The set-up for the plot is a bit formulaic ( and layered with Spielberg's need for romanticism ) , but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable . Vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won Oscars , as did Spielberg ( who deserved it ) . I was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is , given the feel-good reputations by many of the principles involved . I'm not a lover of this particular movie genre , but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle . from
552127	989035	50422	6.0	The three leads are more charming than this scenario . . .	Haughty blonde movie star , about to premiere her latest picture " The Kidnapped Bride " , is kidnapped herself by two would-be ruffians who are actually just a couple of nice guys out to catch a break . United Artists comedy-drama , produced on the cheap and with perplexing changes in tone . Jane Russell , Ralph Meeker , and Keenan Wynn are an engaging trio , but turning this kidnap into a joshing love-triangle doesn't convince for a second . The script , based on Sylvia Tate's book , seems to know very little about how Hollywood works ( the opening scene has the star and her handlers in the projection room viewing THE TRAILER to her new movie ! ) . Russell , looking fabulous with or without her wig , is a great drawing card and is very amusing working her way through this sarcasm-laden script with the cynical airs of a seasoned pro . It's quite understandable why both Meeker and Wynn fall for her but , as a screwball romance , the movie certainly comes up short . from
553325	989035	120633	6.0	Straightforward legal case with environmental overtures . . .	John Travolta gives a dandy performance as a cocky Boston personal injury lawyer who heads up a small but burgeoning firm , almost passing up on headline-making case of a major food company subsidiary found to be dumping toxic chemicals into the water supply of a small-town Massachusettes town , causing many of the children there to get sick or die . Neatly directed and scripted film from Jonathan Harr's factual book allows for both legal statistics and some dry legal humor , and avoids exploiting an emotionally-wrenching theme ( the death of children ) for hug-tugging sentiment . The film is direct and compact , pausing only occasionally for a dramatic character turn , and is handsomely-made if not terrifically entertaining . Travolta and nemesis lawyer Robert Duvall ( smiling like the Cheshire Cat ) are wonderful to watch sparring with one another , and the specifics of the case are intriguing . from
550731	989035	58972	6.0	Patty is a whirling dervish of energy	Scrappy theatrical comedy filmed on a television budget , with Patty Duke putting the high school jocks to shame with her athletic abilities ( seems sneaky Pat has been running track to a secret " beat " in her head ! ) . Nothing memorable , but worth-watching for the always-good Jim Backus as Patty's politician father - - who can't seem to decide where he stands on women's issues - - and Patty herself is also very lively . Her short platinum ' do is a bit odd ( and occasionally looks like a wig or a blonde mop-head ) , but she seems happier here than on her self-named TV series and does very well with her two song numbers ( her voice is shaky and without focus , but extremely bright and appealing ) . from
553555	989035	41260	6.0	Romantic casualties of the Cold War . . .	Excellent young adult performance by 18-year-old Elizabeth Taylor playing newlywed American living abroad whose soldier husband is up to no good : he's living a double life and is really a communist traitor ! Underpopulated , underwritten melodrama does have one strong aspect : a surprisingly strong , spunky woman at the center of the story . Robert Taylor is solid as Taylor's 30-ish husband , but any psychological conflicts are not quick to come out ( there is a tense duck-hunting scene where the couple runs into trouble , but it's just shucked off ) . Liz looks beautiful and gives a fairly complex portrayal here - - her eyes glinting with suspicion and anger . The film isn't a classic , nor is it swill , but as a quickie product from MGM , it's probably better than it had to be . from
551868	989035	156391	7.0	Fairly strong and involving for a television movie . . .	Jean Smart is a tower of strength as married mother of two who follows a hunch one afternoon and tracks her husband of 20 years to a hotel room - - where he's cozily wrapped in a white terrycloth robe and making chit-chat with a strapping man in a matching towel . His secret's out ! Of course this is all clich√© by now , and some viewers will bemoan that fact and give up right there , but the TV film " A Change of Heart " addresses these issues with a lot of forceful emotion and realistic exchanges . There's hurt , and anger , and tears , but it doesn't sink into sap . The male lover isn't given any dimensions - - and seems to have a great home of his own , so why were they meeting in a hotel ? - - and the teenagers involved are tiresomely belligerent , but Jean Smart is the acting centerpiece here and she does the movie a world of good . Her speech to the board of directors where she and her husband work is flawlessly handled , and her bravura spirit at the end will give a lot of viewers hope . A good actress can do that .
551292	989035	382625	7.0	Implausible but fast and exciting ; a good ride . . .	Dan Brown's bestseller had all the surprising twists and turns of a Sidney Sheldon novel - - add to that a plot concerning a secret sect of the Catholic Church involved in a conspiracy and a treasure hunt to the Holy Grail and you've got a pretty entertaining thriller . Ron Howard directs this adaptation fluidly ( it may be his best directing yet ) , however the opening moments involving a murder and some nasty self-flagellation are off-putting . Tom Hanks is very good as a famous writer and professor who lectures on the study of symbols as language ; he's pulled into a murder investigation in France and soon finds himself on the run with a French female officer who was the granddaughter of the victim . There's a bit of heavy exposition with the arrival of Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing , a learned acquaintance of Hanks who helps sort out the clues left by Audrey Tautou's grandfather . Jean Reno's police captain presents a different problem - - he's left too ambiguous without enough material . Otherwise , " Da Vinci " is a fast-paced game of wits topped with exciting flourishes and European travel . from
551658	989035	35279	7.0	Patented ' wrong man ' plot becomes top-flight Hitchcock . . .	Screenwriters Peter Viertel , Joan Harrison , and ( of all people ) Dorothy Parker enable director Alfred Hitchcock to expound on what may have been his favorite movie theme : innocent man , wrongly fingered for crime , takes it on the lam . Hitchcock , who some credit with originating the story , engineers a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend ; he sets out on journey to find the real culprit . Plenty of excitement on a grand-scale , with usually-colorless actors ( Priscilla Lane , Norman Lloyd , Alan Baxter ) doing surprisingly fine work . Even eternally-smug Robert Cummings gets into the proper spirit ! from
551460	989035	52722	7.0	Shies away from treacle - - and Albert Sharpe is wonderful	Until " Mary Poppins " came along , I don't think Hollywood took Walt Disney seriously as a live-action movie producer . James Baskett got a special Oscar for " Song of the South " , as did Hayley Mills for " Pollyanna " , but a good many of the performances in Walt's early output deserved a more substantial recognition ( as with James Robertson Justice in " The Sword and the Rose " ) . Albert Sharpe is no exception . Playing storytelling oldster Darby O'Gill in this hit film , Sharpe is fabulous spinning tall tales in a quaint Irish village , capturing himself a real leprechaun and being rewarded with three wishes for setting the little guy free . Colorful outing - - better for adults than , say , " The Gnome Mobile " - - relying less on sugary sentiment and doting tots than on old-fashioned whimsy . Sean Connery has a nice romance with Janet Munro ( who is always a pleasure ) and the special effects , particularly near the end , are quite marvelous . from
552282	989035	112697	7.0	A refreshing change from the John Hughes / " Breakfast Club " generation	A silky-smooth , vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school . Far from the insufferable smugness of all those ' 80s teen-flicks , " Clueless " is bright - - in both senses of the word - - clever , funny , fanciful and yet grounded in reality ( a rich one ) . Alicia Silverstone is adorable , but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked ( they all get their share of funny lines and star-making scenes , particularly Dan Hedaya , superb as Silverstone's father ) . Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's " Emma " than based upon it , with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters . from
552232	989035	87747	7.0	Another slice of bittersweet melancholia from Paul Mazursky . . .	Robin Williams is excellent as a Russian circus performer in New York City with his troupe for the first time , deciding to defect and become a U . S . citizen . After appropriately dark , but heavy-handed opening , this comedy-drama from director Paul Mazursky suddenly finds its niche and seldom wavers . It appears from the earliest parts of the picture that Williams may be giving yet another of his overly-colorful , overly-cartoonish performances , but he too gets into the groove of this project and fleshes out this charming , confounding , complicated man ; Maria Conchita Alonso is also wonderful as the working girl who falls for him ( they have terrific chemistry , and Alonso has never been better ) . A fuzzy , friendly , thoughtful film , a bit too long but occasionally sublime . from
551818	989035	70337	7.0	Deadly-earnest camp musical ; often deliriously enjoyable . . .	Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller , was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 , sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years . Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country , but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain ; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La , where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content . Some of the performances by the classy cast aren't so classy ( the effervescent mood of the piece , the lilting Burt Bacharach-Hal David tunes , as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly ) . Peter Finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident Liv Ullmann ; Sally Kellerman is a malcontent who spits out lines like , " I got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off , so that people with their heads STILL ON - - and usually under hairdryers - - could get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe " ; John Gieguld " as Chang " , an Asian who learned to speak English while attending Oxford , is humorously self-amused ( but why no songs for Chang ? ) . Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw-dropping ( " On the Good Ship Lollipop / how did Christopher Columbus / sail across the sea ? " ) and the pacing gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today . However , the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting . The two-dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing , and the movie's silliness is infectious . It ends up being a lot of fun . from
550905	989035	104511	7.0	Featherweight dark comedy about a sexy bloodsucker , though exceptionally well-done	John Landis is not the type of director who goes for any deeper meaning in his films outside of the occasional well-staged car chase in heavy traffic ; however , this time , working with Michael Wolk's first-rate screenplay , he excels in narrative as well as in visual form . An undercover cop in Pittsburgh , posing as a thief for the Mob , becomes attracted to the scintillating French woman who is hellbent on killing kingpin Robert Loggia ( seems she's a bloodsucker by night - - and forgot to " finish the food " the evening she put the bite on Loggia's Sal the Shark ! ) . Not terribly bright , but full of puckish black humor and one exciting , masterfully staged sequence after another . And when things calm down a bit , as with the motel sequence between hot twosome Anne Parillaud and Anthony LaPaglia , Landis is adept at smoothly changing the movie's rhythm . It's an impressive , gory , foul-mouthed , yet adrenalized and satirical piece of work , Landis ' best . from
552381	989035	60522	7.0	Chic , but somewhat enervated caper comedy . . .	Jaunty star-driven fare makes for fun , colorful entertainment in a low-key ( if you're not too demanding ) . Audrey Hepburn ( lovely as always ) attempts to get her art-forging father out of trouble , hitching up with crafty Peter O'Toole to steal back a phony antique out of the art museum . Handsome production , fine supporting cast including scene-stealers Hugh Griffith , Jacques Marin , and wily Eli Wallach , but not many big laughs . O'Toole cooks up an ingenious plan once he and Audrey are inside the museum , and the pacing picks up considerably from there , though it does take a while . Hepburn , at her most " mod " , glides through a bit passively , although she and O'Toole turn out to be a surprisingly good screen match-up , creating sly , suave chemistry . from
552731	989035	71424	7.0	" K-i-s-s o-f-f ! "	Ostensibly a mindless , flashy car-chase - & - crash B-flick has all the usual drive-in elements , but there's more going on here than at first appears . Two NASCAR enthusiasts , needing to buy a new entry vehicle , concoct an elaborate plan to rob a grocery store ; Larry is the talent behind the wheel , Deke is the contemplative brains of the outfit . Soon they're saddled with good-time girl Mary , stubborn and sassy , who proves her mettle on a wild ride getting out of town . From Richard Unekis ' book " The Chase " , with a plot that is exactly that , yet the script by Leigh Chapman and Antonio Santean is surprisingly funny and literate and John Hough's direction is exceptionally tight with very little nonsense . Peter Fonda is appropriately manic , loose and shaggy , and Susan George has fun playing low-class ( she has a tough time camouflaging her British accent , but it passes ) ; every time Mary uses her brains , it provides more shading and substance in the character . Adam Roarke is a revelation as accomplice Deke , a sensitive , complicated man with heart and soul ; he's not above larceny - - he even masterminds it - - but he's a thinker , and a realist . This film should have broken Roarke as a star in Hollywood , he is incredibly good . Vic Morrow has the standard role of the lawman on the trio's trail ( he plays cat-and-mouse with them , and vice-versa , which is routine ) and it's nice to see Roddy McDowall in a non-hysterical role as the supermarket manager . The chases are terrifically charged with adrenaline and excitement , and while the character animosities are trivial , the movie is stylish and wire-drawn . Apparently a big hit with Quentin Tarantino , who used a film-clip in his " Jackie Brown " ( and adopted this picture's violent , jokey tone as well ) . Good show : from
550644	989035	71358	7.0	Despite formula , quite moving	Pat Conroy's autobiographical book " The Water Is Wide " proves to be something of a Southern " Up The Down Staircase " , yet despite the teacher - going - against - the - odds formula , " Conrack " really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash . These students ( uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina ) are actually shown learning , and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet . The one actual actress in the bunch ( Tina Andrews , an amazing performer ) plays the " tough nut " Conrack has to crack , and once she falls under his charms , it all seems a breeze . But the story is not ready-made for a happy ending , and I wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale . It's beautifully done . The script veers off course every now and then , but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always fall back on Jon Voight's solid presence . Scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much , but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion , and the actual ending is their payoff . out of
551467	989035	44418	7.0	A more gentlemanly John Wayne	The Duke ( in ties and jackets ? ) ferrets out Commies in Hawaii along with strapping partner James Arness . For a movie so obviously filled to the brim with machismo , the results surprise us with just a scene or two of fisticuffs and much more romance between Wayne and Nancy Olsen ( who moves quickly , and can you blame her ? ) . The black-and-white cinematography is quite beautiful , with silvery shots of the tropics in all their ' 50s splendor . " Big Jim McLain " features one of John Wayne's best walk-throughs ; he looks a little sheepish , but he's so amiable you forget he's really not in character . The drama at hand is tidied up rather quickly , yet the film is directed with a steady hand and has an easy-going pace . Its flag-waving stance is 100 % purple heart-patriotic , but that's certainly in keeping with the era , as well as with Wayne's all-American persona . from
552624	989035	539221	7.0	Packed with plot . . . and plenty of sexy action	Some of these early episodes of " Charlie's Angels " have enough plot for a TV movie . . . with the strong production elements and supporting cast worthy of a television feature . A tragic auto accident out on the dustbowl racecar circuit leads the Angels to believe there was dirty-pool being played out on the track , but that's just the first half of the story . Sabrina ( who it turns out did a little racecar driving in her youth ! ) poses as the new driver - - with a Texas drawl ; Bosley and Jill are father and daughter Holy Rollers ; Kelly does some leg-work interviewing the victim's parents ( in a sensitive scene ) and later joins the gang at the arena , amusingly getting one suspect arrested for drunk driving . Exceptionally well-plotted installment , though I doubt Jill would be so sloppy as to leave evidence behind in a motel room , or that all her nosy questions would be overlooked by the locals with just a flash of her blinding-white smile .

Brave , hard-hitting adaptation of Phyllis Bottoms ' novel concerns tight-knit German family in 1933 Europe who are suddenly ( and violently ) torn apart by the invading Nazis once Hitler rises to power . A shattering chapter in history is vividly recalled by director Frank Borzage and a terrific cast including James Stewart , Margaret Sullavan , Robert Young , Robert Stack , and Frank Morgan . MGM production was banned in Germany and , in fact , caused all MGM product to be banned there for several years ! Story of family love overcome by war and power has not aged a bit , with haunting scenes and fine b & w cinematography . from
552218	989035	60390	8.0	Engrossing , underrated sci-fi	From Ray Bradbury's novel about totalitarian society that has banned books and printed words in order to eliminate independent thought ; Oskar Werner plays professional book-burner who becomes enraptured with stories . Possibly a bit too thin at this length , but a fascinating peek at a cold future ( which the times have just about caught up to ) . Didn't get a warm reception from critics in its day , yet the performances by Werner and Julie Christie ( in a dual role as both Werner's wife and his rebel girlfriend ) are top notch . I was never a fan of director Francois Truffaut's too-precious stories of childhood , but this film , curiously his only English-language picture , is extremely well-directed ; the sequence with the woman and her books afire is one amazing set-piece , with tight editing , incredible and precise art direction , and the camera in all the right places . Truffaut lets you feel the agony of book paper curling up black in a mass of orange flames , and the proud defiance of the woman as she herself strikes the match . Unforgettable . from
550969	989035	192387	8.0	Fascinating restoration and behind-the-scenes gossip . . .	Chronicling the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork " Vertigo " , we get background information and amazing behind-the-scenes photographs and gossip about one of the greatest films ever made . I loved getting to see those rare pics of Hitch in San Francisco , and that original cover of the French novel " D'entre les Morts " , upon which " Vertigo " is based , is stunning ( try finding that in a pinch ! ) . Roddy McDowall narrates in his inimitable , non show-offy way . The quick interviews with Kim Novak , Barbara Bel Geddes and others are very enjoyable . Perfect for whetting the palate for a " Vertigo " viewing , so put them both on ( this one first ) for a stylish , informative evening .
552055	989035	79033	8.0	Viva Vaccaro !	Brenda Vaccaro never really fit into any conventional Hollywood mold ; even a brief stint as Michael Douglas ' real-life girlfriend didn't get her major press , so the lady had to find her own way . Terrific early spots in " Midnight Cowboy " and the Robert Mitchum mood piece " Going Home " didn't quite afford her a following , but in 1974 she got an Oscar nod as an unabashed man-chaser in " Once Is Not Enough " , and Hollywood finally began taking notice . In this TV-pilot / French film remake , Vaccaro really hits her stride playing a crafty crime-solver surrounded by colorful helpers ( including a charming Ron Silver , back when he really WAS charming ) , Brenda is feisty , funny , and totally into her character . The subsequent television series was also good but lacked the consistently strong writing of this opener . Years have gone by , but I still think of this movie and some of Vaccaro's expressions and responses . She's a gem !
553597	989035	71360	8.0	Coppola's best film	Ingenious and mesmerizing little art film from Francis Ford Coppola , just off " The Godfather Part II " and doing astounding , fluid work . Gene Hackman gives a superbly controlled performance as a wire-tapper who gets too involved in one of his cases , leaving him in the center of a macabre swirl of events . One of those quiet movies that fans of today's blockbusters probably won't appreciate ; it tells us quite a lot about the main character without actually saying much at all , so assured are the visuals . It ends on a chilling note that leaves the protagonist alienated from his life , but Coppola is careful never to alienate his audience . It's a winner . from
553147	989035	539207	8.0	" I have the feeling one of us is gonna get to play call-girl . . . "	This episode of Aaron Spelling's " Charlie's Angels " , only the tenth show of the program's first season , already knew how to exploit Farrah Fawcett-Majors ' appeal to budding male ( and female ) teenagers : put her on a skateboard and have her roll for her life ! The Angels are assigned to the case of a missing man , an antiques dealer and sometime-mama's boy , who was also the unwitting victim of a prostitution / robbery racket . All three of our girls get a chance to shine here : Jaclyn Smith gently shakes down a bartender for vital info ( just after ordering tequila with lime salt ! ) ; Kate Jackson climbs over a barbed-wire fence and into an industrial yard , only to be taken hostage by the two goons who pull off the robbery schemes ; and Farrah , well , she aids in the nabbing of a prized racehorse and then outruns the nutcracker-wielding villain on her trusty skateboard . Sure , it's ' 70s kitsch , and not without flaws ( the biggest lapse comes when Jill and Sabrina pick up the racehorse , with the horse's maniacal owner apparently nowhere in sight ; they return to the office and call him , and he's right there on the property ! ) . Still , the dialogue is sometimes fun ( Farrah to prostie Laurette Spang : " Your name isn't Tracy . It rhymes with Stacy and Macy and all those other JIVE names hookers pick up ! " ) . The repartee between the Angels ultimately holds this episode ( and dozens of others ) together , and when Bosley gets involved it's usually a hoot .
552870	989035	70291	9.0	You don't have to move . . . . . . if you're smart enough	Superb whodunit with all the pieces right there for you to place : James Coburn is wicked as the cunning gamester inviting to his yacht the failed screenwriter ( Richard Benjamin ) , his alcoholic wife ( Joan Hackett , in a sympathetic performance ) , the catty agent ( Dyan Cannon , more wired than ever before ) , the starlet ( Raquel Welch , looking a little out-of-it ) , the starlet's husband ( Ian McShane ) , and a director down-on-his-luck ( James Mason , the calm-head who pays attention to the details ) . The only trouble with the film is that the first-half ( involving a hilarious personality game ) is SO good and clever that the murder-mystery second-half lets you down a bit . Still , these characters are a wonderfully tainted , self-absorbed lot and Dyan Cannon's breakdown after someone almost offs her is a wild bit of breakneck acting . I also admired Welch's scene at midnight on the top deck , talking about stealing a coat ( she's very seductive and charming , though she continues to whisper her dialogue throughout the film and comes off as slightly dazed ) . The character conflicts and the reasoning behind who-does-what-to-whom doesn't bear a great deal of scrutiny ( even after several viewings , I'm still not clear on that business regarding the cabin keys ) ; still , the film is extremely entertaining , a verbally exciting match-of-wits by a group of Hollywood hopefuls and burn-outs . from
552163	989035	52357	9.0	From among the dead . . .	Alfred Hitchcock's " Vertigo " has a narcotizing effect , a lulling , dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off , which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it . Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love - - a suicidal woman he lost , but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past . Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's " Scottie " more so than any other character in his films , and , having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself , is careful not to let him have his way , so the climax may be disappointing to some . However , this glamor-mystery is blissfully gorgeous , fascinatingly written and extremely well-acted . Only one question : is the hotel manager ( Ellen Corby ) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad ? from
