366138	3109237	106682	1.0	A lost film that should have stayed lost	It's almost impossible to find out anything about The Dead Talk Back . It was made in 1956 or 1957 ( depending on which sources you're look at ) and immediately shelved . As far as I can tell , it was never shown anywhere . I'm assuming that sometime around 1993 , Sinister Cinema found the film and somehow procured the rights to it and released it on video . I assume 1993 because that's the year listed on IMDb for the movies release . Somehow The Dead Talk Back came to the attention of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and was included on their Season 6 schedule . That's about it as far as the story behind The Dead Talk Back . If it weren't for MST3K , I doubt this thing would have more than 5 votes on IMDb . As for the movie , it's mind-numbingly awful . It's dull , uneventful , and a total waste of time . The acting ranges from over-the-top to , well , no acting at all . The special effects look like they came from a 1950s Radio Shack equivalent clearance sale . The plot attempts to include elements of horror , drama , mystery , science fiction , and every other genre you can name and fails miserably at each . There's so little entertainment value in The Dead Talk Back that the MST3K crew seemed to have trouble with it . They just didn't seem as " inspired " and , as a result , this is one of the weaker episodes of MST3K I've seen .
366770	3109237	118137	1.0	" Wuur-wilf ? You mean Joel thinks this thing is a wuur-wilf ? "	When I write one of these little reviews , there are certain words I try to avoid when describing a movie . Some words just don't seem appropriate . But when it comes to Werewolf , I'm going to break this rule . Werewolf has to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen . While watching Werewolf , it's difficult to fathom that an upright walking human with opposable thumbs and an I . Q . above that of a water sprinkler could have made something so inept . Werewolf's plot is an absolute unadulterated mess . You could give cameras to a band of poo throwing monkeys and end up with a more coherent movie . The actors are given some of the most inane dialogue ever recorded . And it doesn't help matters that three of the main characters ( Adrianna Miles being the worst offender ) sound more like they need to be in an ESL class than shooting a movie . If Joe Estevez emoting like there's no tomorrow is the highlight of the movie , you know you're in deep trouble . In short , Werewolf is a disaster . But , as bad as Werewolf admittedly is , coming up with a rating has proved more difficult that I imagined . Much of the movie is so unintentionally hilarious that I was entertained despite the multitude of problems . Take the film's continuity ( or lack thereof ) as an example . Watching actor Jorge Rivero's hair go from almost black and slicked back to slightly graying with less of a greasy look to brown with blond highlights and a feathered appearance all in a matter of 15 minutes is too funny . Or take the scenes where the werewolf transforms from an actor in makeup to a stuffed animal being shaken at the camera to someone in a bear suit all within 45 seconds ? it's laugh-out-loud , hold your sides so they don't split hysterical . But in the end , it's still a pathetic movie and a rating of seems somehow generous .
366102	3109237	93872	1.0	" You're all useless and crazy . "	Robot Holocaust is about the lamest , most pathetic attempt at making a post-apocalyptic movie that I've seen . And I thought the Italians were the masters of wretched Mad Max wannabes . Some of those movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo . The plot is nonsensical ? even with a narrator setting up every scene . And boy does it drag . Scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening . The special effects ( and I use the word " special " loosely ) consist of sock puppets . Yes , that's right ? sock puppets ! The acting is abysmal . Angelika Jager is in the running for worst performance I've ever seen . Sure , she's French or German or whatever ? but man is she bad . I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie . So I'll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many . However , and fortunately for me , I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust . Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner . For a season one episode , the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time . On my MST3K rating scale , I give this episode a ? seek it out .
366647	3109237	78350	1.0	Michael " Paycheck " Caine strikes again !	As a point of reference , I don't rate every other movie I see a . Of the 1 , 005 movies I've bothered to rate over the past few years , I've only given 20 of them a . It takes a " special " movie can join the ranks of Prime Evil , The Creeping Terror , and Curse of the Swamp Creature . The Swarm is one of those " special " movies . Watching The Swarm is something of an endurance test . At one point , I felt like I had been sitting and watching for days . I checked the counter and discovered I had only seen 76 minutes ? I still had another 80 minutes left to go . So what went wrong ? In a word - everything . As I've already indicated , The Swarm is dull and tedious . If I'm ever forced to watch this movie again , I can only hope it's the 116 minute version and not the 156 minute director's cut . In addition , the characters do and say the most unrealistic things . Take the movies supposed hero played by Michael Caine and the General played by Richard Widmark . Every conversation these two have is full of absolute nonsense and done in volumes usually reserved for football games . The fact that these two NEVER attempt to work together to accomplish anything is ridiculous . Or , take the fact that Caine's character , who has been appointed by the White House to head up the operation , spends more time tracking down a 10 year-old runaway than he does finding a solution to the bee problem . Unrealistic . The Swarm also features a couple of the most inane love story subplots I've seen . The first features Caine and Katharine Ross who never seem to get beyond admitting they " like " each other . How old are these people ? 12 ? The second is the senior citizen love triangle that goes nowhere and has no real purpose . It's like watching a bad episode of " The Love Boat " . Finally , some of the acting is downright atrocious . Caine and Ross are good actors when given decent material . But in The Swarm , Caine appears to be in it solely for the paycheck and Ross acts as if she realizes how bad it is and just wants out . Picking the negatives out of The Swarm is like shooting fish in a barrel ? it's impossible to miss . And I haven't even discussed the plot ? killer African bees threaten the Southwest . Not a bad idea , but the execution in The Swarm is the worst .
366380	3109237	58615	1.0	Why ?	Why ? Why make a movie like The Starfighters ? My initial thought was that it might be some sort of " wave the flag , isn't the military great , wouldn't you like to join the Air Force " movie . But that can't be right . This thing is too deadly dull to inspire anyone to run out and enlist . Similar movies from the 40s , even though they were often as sappy as could be , at least provided some entertainment with their propaganda . That's not the case here . I defy anyone to find anything remotely entertaining in The Starfighters . I suppose there is some curiosity value in seeing a young B-1 Bob Dornan attempting to act , but I can't imagine watching this thing just to see the former congressman . I also defy anyone to watch The Starfighters without the aid of MST3K . Even these guys ran out of steam during the second , extended , monotonous , in-flight refueling scene . Usually , regardless of how bad a movie is , there are those who find something to enjoy and write reviews on IMDb supporting some facet of the movie . That doesn't appear to be true with The Starfighters . I went through both pages of reviews on IMDb and didn't notice anyone with a positive comment or a rating higher than a for the Starfighters . It's just that bad ! That reminds me , I haven't even mentioned the plot . But there's a reason . The plot in The Starfighters doesn't really matter . The movie is 20 % story and 80 % stock footage of the Air Force's F-104 Starfighter . Can you make a movie entirely of stock footage ? Director Will Zens sure gave it a go with The Starfighters .
366021	3109237	377707	1.0	I wasn't prepared for what I've just seen .	WARNING ? Watching Crocodile could prove hazardous to your physical , mental , and emotional health . Having just finished watching Crocodile , I'm almost dumbfounded by the ineptitude I've witnessed . I had been warned by a couple of trusted friends that the movie was bad , but nothing could prepare for what I've just seen . To call Crocodile bad would be an understatement an an insult to other bad movies . It's one of the worst examples of movie-making I've ever seen . The plot , as best I could discern , involves a man whose entire family is killed by a giant crocodile . The man vows revenge . Sound familiar ? While even the worst of the other " Man vs . Nature " movies I've seen handle this scenario with a little class , originality , or a minimum of technical skill , Crocodile is pathetic in comparison . Acting ? as bad as I've seen . Music ? never appropriate to the image . Editing ? sloppy is too nice a word . Special effects ? what's that ? Plot ? see Jaws . Cinematography ? a monkey could have framed the shots better . Crocodile excels in poorly constructed miniatures , random shots of people and objects that have no bearing on the plot , and an overall incoherence that makes the movies Ed Wood and Al Adamson seem like masterpieces . Consider yourself warned . .
366399	3109237	59464	1.0	A complete waste of celluloid	If you've read the background of Monster A Go-Go then you know that the movie almost didn't exist . Hackmeister Bill Rebane started filming the movie in 1961 . A shortage of cash forced him to shelf the project . A few years later , fellow B-filmmaker Herschel Gordon Lewis was looking for a film to complete a double-bill and bought Rebane's unfinished movie . Whether he added new material or only re-edited what was already there is up to conjecture , but the result was Monster A Go-Go . I've seen a slew of bad movies in my life , but only a very few of them are as bad as Monster A Go-Go . Over the years , I've rated several films a ( Laserblast , Midnight , and Invasion of the Star Creatures for example ) , but this one joins that special fraternity of films that make-up the worst of the worst . Monster A Go-Go takes a place beside the likes of Prime Evil and The Starfighters as a complete waste of celluloid . Monster A Go-Go is a total bore and features nothing that remotely resembles entertainment . When a film loses a viewer's interest 30 seconds into its runtime , you know you're in trouble . And if possible , Monster A Go-Go takes this incredibly putrid start and builds on it . The movie actually becomes increasingly pointless and dull throughout its 70 minutes as it limps toward one of the worst endings ever put to a movie . The movie doesn't really end as much as Rebane or Lewis or whoever just stopped filming . If only they would have stopped filming about 70 minutes earlier . This was another MST3K viewing for me . Normally , I get a kick out of MST3K regardless of how bad the movie is . But Monster A Go-Go is just so bad that it really puts a drag on everything . I give them credit for attempting to make the movie in any way worthwhile , but it seems to have been an impossible task . I give this episode of MST3K a - find another episode to add to the top of your " to see " list .
366105	3109237	174917	2.0	" Excuse me , but have you seen my little monkey ? "	How do you explain a movie like Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders ? On its surface , the movie seems to be some sort of children's fantasy that was marketed at families . I mean what's wrong with a movie that features a kindly grandfather telling his grandson a couple of harmless bedtime stories about Merlin the Magician ? Well , when the two bedtime stories in question feature pets dying in fires , people turning into horrible creatures , and images of Satan ? I would say there's a whole lot wrong with it . And surely the movie wasn't aimed at real , hardcore horror fans . The combination of the grandfather and Merlin would be enough to turn off any real horror fanatic . Getting past the question of the movie's target audience , the movie itself offers very little . The movie's set-up as an anthology is clunky at best . As I've indicated , Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders features two wrappings ? ( 1 ) the grandfather and ( 2 ) Merlin . Bad idea all the way around ! As for the two featurettes , neither is anything to get excited about . The first is entirely predictable and features poor acting and special effects . And director Kenneth Berton got even lazier with the second featurette . It's nothing more than a chopped-up version of a movie he made in 1984 ? 12 years previously . I don't mean he remade that movie ? he re-used it ! I seem to remember seeing the 1984 movie and not enjoying it . It's not any better with a new name and a dozen years later . Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders makes for a very disappointing MST3K episode . With something this bad and utterly ridiculous , I would have expected a real home-run . I've seen the MST3k episode a couple of times not and cannot rate it any higher than a ? don't put it at the top of your " to see " list .
366501	3109237	88772	2.0	" These river bottoms are truly a sight to behold . "	For the life of me , I cannot imagine why anyone thought that The Legend of Boggy Creek ( 1972 ) needed a sequel ? and 13 years later at that . The first Boggy Creek movie isn't anything special ( though I admit to an explained fondness for it ) , but episode # 2 is something different altogether . Boggy Creek II is beyond bad . In this one , Professor " Doc " Lockart from the University of Arkansas assembles a team to explore the swamps of Southern Arkansas in hopes of finding the Boggy Creek Monster . Along the way , he tells his research assistants stories of the creature . Once in the swamp , they encounter something they can't explain , but come away with no real proof . No proof , that is , until they make the fateful decision to take a boat trip down river to Old Man Crenshaw's place . There , they find all the proof they'll need . The actual legend of the Boggy Creek Monster seems to be about as ridiculous as this movie . I'm probably wrong about this , but if it weren't for Charles B . Pierce , I doubt anyone would have even heard of the thing . He has single-handedly kept it alive . And some of the stories he uses in Boggy Creek II as evidence of the creatures existence are just plain old stupid . Through his mayonnaise covered flashback lens , he relates the story of an old man who has a blowout while traveling a lonely stretch of road one night . While changing the tire , the man is " attacked " by something . He never regains consciousness before dying . Pierce blames the creature . Huh ? So let me get this straight ? the man dies before he can tell anyone his story yet Pierce jumps to the conclusion that he was attached by some mythical creature ? Yeah , right . That's certainly one giant leap in logic . Why not just blame all the unexplained deaths in Southern Arkansas on the creature . Sure would save a lot of time and effort . The other problems with Boggy Creek II are too numerous to even attempt to mention . Everything from the believability of the " research team " to the acting to the special effects is bottom of the barrel . And you can put the blame squarely at the feet of auteur Charles B . Pierce . What's more pathetic is Pierce's apparent attitude toward the whole thing . He has a smug look on his face that just screams " Hey ! Look at me ! Writer , director , actor ? boy , am I cool or what ? " Even sadder ( if it can get any worse ) is that Pierce plays it all with the straightest of faces even while wearing short-shorts and waving a gun at guy in a monkey suit . And his narration is just as bad ( or should I say funny ) . His unnatural style of delivery , combined with some incredibly corny lines about the beauty of nature , is laugh out loud funny . Unintentionally , Boggy Creek II is a laugh riot !
366423	3109237	156894	2.0	" Look boys , I'm a hot dog ! "	I've got nothing against movies that are a bit offbeat , weird , or even bizarre ? in fact , the obscure usually attracts me . And Pink Angels is certainly one offbeat , weird , and even bizarre movie . The plot ( or what there is of it ) involves a group of gay bikers headed to Los Angeles who run afoul of a band of Hell's Angels types and a straight-laced military type . Unfortunately , Pink Angels is also one incredibly bad movie . Just because something is different doesn't make it good . Nothing about this movie is least bit entertaining . It's supposed to be a comedy , but I didn't so much as smile ? let alone laugh . Some might say it's a product of it's time , but I can't imagine anyone with a pulse in any decade finding this stinker worth watching . The over-the-top gay stereotypes aren't funny . For example , there's a whole sequence involving candelabras and champagne at a picnic with grubby bikers . Funny ? Not at all . And the subplot involving the General is just plain old stupid . Weak production values , bad acting , and one pointless scene after the next only add to the misery . I've given Pink Angels an extra point for curiosity value , but that's the only reason . My recommendation ? don't waste your time .
366212	3109237	85824	3.0	Major Disappointment	- From the moment I saw this listed as on the Mondo Macabro website , I was intrigued . It looked good and the reviews I read were mostly positive . So when it was finally released , I couldn't wait to get my hands on it . After watching it , I wish I would have waited . - What a major disappointment . Right from the start , I knew that Panic Beats couldn't meet my expectations . The whole look and feel of the film is terrible . It has that straight-to-video look that usually destroys atmosphere . The sets are nothing special at all . Most of the film looks like it could have been shot in my house . The story is incredibly predictable . There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot , but most are telegraphed from a mile away . The gore scenes are horribly done . And the whole concept of a knight that comes back from the dead is straight out of Scooby Doo . It's not a very frightening image . - Paul Naschy does his best to provide some chills . With raised eyebrows and a menacing stare , he does his best to look frightening . But for the most part , it doesn't work . The most frightening scenes are of Naschy naked in the bathtub . Now that had me screaming . - As for Mondo Macabro's disc , it's very well done . I have no complaints with the image , sound , or subtitles . The extras are quite nice , including a brief history of Spanish horror .
366150	3109237	65660	3.0	At least it has a decent Bruno Nicolai score	Because this is Franco , giving a plot rundown is something of a futile challenge , but I'll do my best to hit some of the highlights . Dr . Frankenstein arrives in some unnamed village to work in a supposedly abandoned castle . The castle actually isn't so abandoned as it's really the home of Dracula and his vampire servants . It's not long before Dr . Frankenstein revives his creation . Dr . Frankenstein puts his monster and Dracula to work kidnapping local women for his experiments . Why ? I have no idea , but he straps them to a table and does his thing . But Dracula being Dracula is sucking the life out of some of the locals . It's up to Dr . Seward and the local gypsies / werewolves to put a stop to Frankenstein and Dracula . During the first few moments of Dracula , Prisoner of Frankenstein , I was having trouble believing that this was a Franco film . The opening shots of the castle with Bruno Nicolai's score are well done and , for the lack of anything better , un-Franco-like . But this impression only lasted a few moments as Franco quickly shifts from the imposing and foreboding castle to a shot of a random dog on a random staircase . That's Franco for you . Compared with some of the other Franco films I've seen , Dracula , Prisoner of Frankenstein isn't too bad . Don't misunderstand , it's not very good , but if you've seen something like Franco's Oasis of the Zombies , this movie is a winner . You get a lot of what you expect from Franco ? suspect acting , poor make-up effects , and shaky camera work . One thing that really bothered me , though , is that Franco can't seem to decide what time period his film is set . While some characters drive cars , Dr . Seward gets around in a horse and buggy . And even though Dr . Frankenstein has a large collection of machines that require electricity , there's not a light bulb to be found anywhere . Things like this just bug me . . In the end , I can't in good conscious recommend Dracula , Prisoner of Frankenstein to anyone other than the most die-hard of Franco completists .
366745	3109237	57100	3.0	The worst of the Gidget films	Gidget Goes to Rome is easily the low point of the series . The comedy is lame and the story is neither original nor as sweet as Gidget . While Cindy Carol makes a better lead than Deborah Walley did in Gidget Goes Hawaiian , she's not going to make anyone forget about Sandra Dee . The series should have ended in Hawaii . Maybe it's just me , but I found a few things about Gidget Goes to Rome a little weird . First , take the relationship between Gidget and Moondoggie as presented in this movie . James Darren looks to be about twice the age of Carol . Seeing the older Darren snuggling up to a girl half his age is just a little too creepy for me to enjoy . Second , Moondoggie spends the entire movie ignoring Gidget and wooing the hot Italian tour guide . He even asks her to marry him . Yet when she refuses and sends him on his way , Gidget takes him back with open arms and without any questions . Again , it's just too creepy .
366802	3109237	89104	3.0	" No sugar you idiot ! "	I should have known better ? a sequel to a movie ( 1990 : The Bronx Warriors ) that itself is barely average . Generally , sequels have a hard time matching the standard set by the original . And even though the standard isn't very high in this case , Escape from the Bronx is a failure in comparison with its predecessor . First , the sequel lacks any imagination . We see the same gunfights and explosions we saw in the first film . Half of the death scenes could have been spliced in from 1990 : The Bronx Warrior and I doubt anyone would notice . Second , if possible the acting is even worse this time around . Mark Gregory ( and his painted on pants ) wasn't much of an actor in the first film . Here , he seems to have regressed . Also , I've read review after review that gush about Henry Silva's performance in Escape from the Bronx . My response ? what performance ? He spends 90 % of his already limited screen-time on the phone . What's so impressive about that ? Third , I never thought I would miss Fred Williamson , but he's part of what made 1990 : The Bronx Warriors as good as it was . An overacting Antonio Sabato is a poor replacement . And finally , the plot in Escape from the Bronx is completely absurd . The scenes of Manhattan indicate that very little has changed in the future . I would assume that would include people's perceptions on the value of human life . The notion that a company would have a business model that includes wiping-out the citizens of an entire city is ridiculous . That company wouldn't be around very long .
366881	3109237	402022	3.0	" We're meant to die . Its what makes everything about us matter . "	Aeon Flux ( Charlize Theron ) is an assassin in the year 2415 . She works for a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the government . Her target is Trevor Goodchild ( Marton Csokas ) , the leader of what's left of Earth . But before Aeon can pull the trigger , something strange happens . A memory is sparked of a previous life when she knew Goodchild . She discovers that for the past 400 years everyone on Earth has been infertile . The human race has carried on through an intricate system of cloning . Trevor tells her that he is near to finding a solution to the problem . But there are some who would have things stay as they are . Trevor Goodchild's brother , Oren ( Jonny Lee Miller ) has plans to overthrow Trevor to maintain the status quo . Aeon changes her mission ? now she must protect Trevor , stop Oren , and end the cycle of cloning . I'm really starting to hate the modern brand of action movies . What happened to the good old days when it was all about shooting people and blowing things up ? Why do filmmakers feel the need to hide their action movies behind a faux sense of intelligence ? Despite all the weird flashback scenes , the annoyingly vague character motivations , and the intentionally muddled plot points , Aeon Flux is no smarter than any other action movie . In fact , all this pseudo-intellectual garbage does is confuse matters to the point the movie becomes incredibly dull . Scene after scene of people talking nonsense does not make for a good action film . And that's just what you get in Aeon Flux . Add to that some of the most uninteresting characters I've seen recently and you've got the makings of an infuriatingly boring movie . The worst offender in this regard has to be Jonny Lee Miller ( though if truth be told , no one comes out looking good ? and that includes Charlize Theron ) . Miller is so dry , so white bread , he's hardly menacing at all . Laughable would be a better description . And why do filmmakers today feel the need to make every action movie look like The Matrix ? I'm no physicist or human physiologist , but people and things don't move and / or behave in nature like they do in these movies . There's a scene where Aeon is about to fall on sharpened blades of grass ( oh , how clever ) . The way she holds herself just inches above the ground with nothing but the insides of her feet is impossible . I'm so tired of seeing this kind of thing . For what it's worth , I'll rate Aeon Flux a .
366167	3109237	64048	3.0	Believe it or not , but the ingredients are here for an interesting , surreal movie	The plot of The Astro-Zombies is so convoluted that I'm not sure I can sum it up in just a few short sentences - but I'll give it a try . It seems that a series of gristly murders is being blamed on a Dr . DeMarco ( John Carradine ) . Until recently , Dr . DeMarco worked for the government on a top secret project where he was attempting to develop a synthetic man . The synthetic or astro-man was thought to be ideal for long range space flight . The CIA theorizes that Dr . DeMarco has succeeded in creating an astro-man and that it may be responsible for the murders . In addition , a group of spies , headed by a woman named Satana ( Tura Satana ) , is also looking for Dr . DeMarco . They represent a foreign party interested in Dr . DeMarco's discoveries . You know , I could sit here and go through a litany of weaknesses found in The Astro-Zombies . But I'll be honest , that's too easy and , ultimately , too time consuming . It's like shooting fish in a barrel . So I'll stick to the biggest problem I had with The Astro-Zombies and that's how deadly dull much of the movie is . There are great big chunks of the movie where nothing happens . I don't mean it's just slow - I mean there's absolutely nothing going on . For example , there are a series of scenes with Dr . DeMarco preparing his lab for an experiment that seem to go on FOREVER ! Vials are filled , switches are thrown , microscopes are peered through , and on and on it goes . No dialogue ? just mundane , routine scenes of people trying to look busy . I swear that at one point it looked like Carradine was working on a thermostat . And who wouldn't want to see John Carradine do a little home repair project ? But as bad as The Astro-Zombies is , the movie's not a total loss . There's enough bizarreness here that someone with a little talent might have gotten something interesting out of it . I'll go so far to argue that a good editor might be able to shave a half-hour off the thing and come up with an interesting , surreal movie . The ingredients are here ? CIA operatives , John Carradine , mutant creatures , a secret lab , Tura Satana ( who's pretty surreal in her own right ) , a hunchbacked lab assistant , violent attack scenes , an unknown woman in a bikini strapped to a table , and enough scientific hokum for two movies . But until someone takes the time to put this movie together , the best I can give The Astro-Zombies is a .
366648	3109237	53365	3.0	" That's a very nice dress you nearly got on . "	What a shocker ! Who knew that Jayne Mansfield could actually pull off a role that required some real acting ? No , she's no threat to knock Ingrid Bergman off of anyone's top actress list , but she's surprisingly good in Too Hot to Handle . It's quite a change of pace from her roles that I'm more familiar with . Mansfield is definitely much more than the blond sex-kitten I had thought . The other " names " in the cast are Leo Genn and Christopher Lee . Genn is his usual solid self . In fact , I can't remember seeing Genn in anything where he wasn't solid . It's a shame this man isn't better known by the general public . Being something of a Christopher Lee completist , Lee is the reason I wanted to see Too Hot to Handle in the first place . But other than introducing a few dancers , he really doesn't do much . As for the movie , it's a total melodrama with one cliché after the next . It may be listed as " Crime " on IMDb , but the crime elements have very little to do with the actual plot . And , it's dull . Who would have thought that a movie with Jayne Mansfield working in a strip club could be so boring . I didn't care if Genn lost his club . I didn't care if Mansfield got her man . I didn't care if there was an underage girl working in the club . I didn't care about any of it . All I wanted was for the thing to end . There's a sub-plot in the movie involving a dancer who is in the country illegally and the writer who falls for and wants to help her . Their story is the most interesting thing in the movie and keeps me from rating the movie any lower . Unfortunately , this sub-plot goes nowhere .
366408	3109237	53640	3.0	" Get off my back , Iris . I'm thinking ' . "	After knocking over a market , Eddy Crane ( Tony Travis ) and the rest of his gang stop at a diner for a bite to eat . Quite unexpectedly ( at least I didn't see it coming ) , Eddy begins singing to a little jazzy number playing on the jukebox . He's overheard by a talent agent who thinks he can make Eddy a star . Before you can say " Daddy-O " , Eddy's on TV and has a recording contract lined up . But Eddy can't escape his past . While celebrating his good fortune , one of his friends , Mooney ( Peter Breck ) , kills a bartender . Eddy's agent asks the gang to leave Eddy alone and gets stabbed for his efforts . The gang drags Eddy back down at every opportunity . Eddy's must ultimately fight for his freedom . I wonder if Paul Frees and the rest of those behind this bad idea of a movie had any concept of just what a " beatnik " was . It doesn't appear so . Calling this gang of self-centered , unintelligent , small-time hoods with a Pat Boone style crooner as its leader " beatniks " would have Maynard G . Krebs spinning in his grave . These aren't " beatniks " in the traditional sense of the word . These are not the philosophical counter-cultural bongo beaters Kerouac wrote about . If everyone involved wasn't in their 30s , I'd call them juvenile delinquents . Beatniks ? I don't think so . But beyond the misuse of " beatniks " , the movie has very little to offer . Some moments in The Beatniks might be appealing in that bizarrely entertaining sort of way , but not in any traditional sense . The plot it bad , the acting is horrible , and the cinematography is as lazy as I've seen recently . In short , The Beatniks isn't a very good movie .
366258	3109237	69417	3.0	And I was sure this movie would work for me	On the way home from a day at the beach , four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of Lord and Lady Alexander after their car runs out of gas . They don't know it , but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a Satanic ritual . Jane ( Camille Keaton ) , the only female of the group , is to be sacrificed . As her male companions rush to her aid , one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander . Things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed . The four try to make an escape , but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed . One by one , they meet their fates . Gong into Tragic Ceremony , I was positive I would enjoy it . Slow-burn Gothic horror is right up my alley . I'm also quite fond of some of Riccardo Freda's other movies like The Horrible Dr . Hichcock , The Ghost , and I Vampiri . Tragic Ceremony seemed to be a sure thing . Unfortunately , things don't always work out the way they should . The biggest tragedy with respect to Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this mess of a movie . With a few minor exceptions , nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me . The characters are unlikeable , the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic , and the pacing is terrible . There's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further . In addition , nothing interesting happens for most of the movie . By the time the four leads realize they're in danger , I was well past the point of caring . And I don't understand the reviews I've read that praise the acting of Camille Keaton . I suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting . The three male leads are the very definition of nondescript . They do nothing to stand out . The supporting cast includes some genre favorites like Luigi Pistilli , Luciana Paluzzi , and Paul Muller , but none is given anything to do . In fact Muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes . It's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie .
366812	3109237	88100	3.0	" You filthy rotten bloody shark "	I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish , but I honestly can't seem to come up with much . I can't even come up with many of those " so bad , it's good " kind of moments . Devil Fish is just plain old bad . The plot is completely derivative ( Jaws , anyone ? ) , the acting is wooden , the characters are uninteresting , the special effects are beyond bad , and the score is annoying . Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you've got one stinker of a movie . I think , however , that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget . It doesn't appear that Bava had much to work with . By 1984 , the Italian film industry was in full decline ? especially as far as genre films go . The funding available to Bava was most probably very meager . Film's like Devil Fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good . It's not the only Italian film to suffer this fate . There are a number of Italian movies made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations . However , having said all that and noting the film's many weaknesses , I can't bring myself to rate Devil Fish lower than a . I've even considered rating it higher but can't because I realize how bad a movie it is . Why don't I rate it lower ? Well that's hard to explain . Despite the many problems found in the movie , there's something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably enjoy . It could be as simple as my love for low-budget , cheesy , Italian movies . Maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed , but I enjoy what I enjoy . The Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of Devil Fish is actually very enjoyable . I rate Devil Fish a on my MST3K rating scale . The guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movie's many flaws . One very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when Tom Servo notes , " Just because you can edit , doesn't mean you should " ? highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in Devil Fish .
366324	3109237	59290	4.0	Despite its many flaws , I found it oddly entertaining	Even though The Human Duplicators isn't a very good movie ( it registers far too high on the boredom scale ) there's something oddly entertaining about the whole thing that keep me from rating it a bomb as so many others . It's a crazy mix of 60s sci-fi and spy movies . The plot involves an alien named Kolos ( Richard Kiel ) who comes to earth to prepare the planet for a takeover . His plan involves kidnapping the Earth's most learned scientists and replacing them with duplicates under his control . Agent Glenn Martin ( George Nader ) is sent in to investigate the disappearance of the scientists and get to the bottom of things . Complicating matters is a blind girl ( Dolores Faith ) who Kolos finds himself strangely attracted to . Like I said , The Human Duplicators is not a good movie . It's actually quite bad . In all reality , the 2 . 3 IMDb rating is probably much more accurate than the I've rated it . But I was entertained despite the movie's many problems . It might have been a case of " so bad it's good " ( God , do I hate that expression ) . A secret agent with a blond floozy of an assistant , a giant alien in love with a petite blind girl , human replicants that shatter like terra cotta , a Medieval looking dungeon in Southern California , a roadside motel that doubles for a secret military establishment ? it's all so bizarre !
366232	3109237	65163	4.0	" He who takes from Gwangi the evil one is cursed . "	I'm racking my brain , but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi . A Western with dinosaurs ? What could be more natural ? You gotta wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it ! The plot ? While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus , TJ Breckenridge ( Gila Golan ) , Tuck Kirby ( James Franciscus ) , and the rest of the cast / characters enter a strange , lost valley . There they find not only the miniature horse , but some other , more fearsome creatures as well . Dinosaurs rule this place . Now wouldn't that be an attraction at TJ's circus ? a caged T-Rex ? It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie , I just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie . There are some parts that I actually find almost unwatchable . For the first half of the movie , there just doesn't seem to be much going on . I wasn't necessarily bored , but I did want something to happen . Plodding would be an adjective I would use . To top it off , the movie features a very contrived love story . It feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together . But The Valley of the Gwangi isn't a total waste . There are moments I really enjoyed . Who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a T-Rex . You just don't see stuff like that every day . Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive . There are some really cool shots of Harryhausen's miniatures interacting with people and horses . It might not represent the best of his work , but the effects are very nice . Still , at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the negatives . As much as I hate to do it , I've got to rate The Valley of the Gwangi a .
366383	3109237	52289	4.0	Divining for Heads	While out divining for water , a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns ( Carolyn Kearney ) stumbles upon something else altogether . She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch . Instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for , the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew , a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake . Telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest , Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body ? also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm . While Jessica is certain she feels the presence of evil , can she put a stop to Drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent his becoming whole ? I thought I was fairly familiar with most of Universal's horror output prior to 1960 , but this is one Universal film from the 50s that certainly gets little mention . While The Thing That Couldn't Die isn't what I would call a " good " movie , it does have a few things going for it . First , the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious . Director Will Cowan , whether by luck or intention , is able to give the movie some nice atmosphere from time-to-time . And , the special effects involving the head are certainly creepy . But the whole project is undone by the acting . I'm shocked to learn that any of the supposed " actors " in this thing ever appeared in anything else . You would think that this was a " one and done " type of movie for most of those involved . Kearney is the worst offender . She's horrible . Also , The Thing That Couldn't Die may have been a bit too ambitious for its own good . Given the budget and other limitations , there was no way the movie could aspire to its more lofty ideas . Finally , the movie ends rather abruptly . Just as things are starting to get interesting , The End . What's that about ?
366180	3109237	60956	4.0	Marisa Mell and Margaret Lee would give any Bond girl a run for her money .	I'll keep the plot synopsis short and sweet . Most of Secret Agent Super Dragon was so unnecessarily confusing that little of the plot seemed to matter anyway . In this James Bond wannabe , CIA agent Super Dragon ( Ray Danton ) goes up against a Venezuelan drug lord who uses candy to distribute his merchandise . Anything else beyond that wouldn't be much more than speculation as I found myself completely in the dark during much of the movie . I'm not one who needs to be spoon-fed plot points , but how about making what's going on just a little clearer ? Too much of the movie seemed like a series of unrelated set pieces that didn't fit together . But the biggest problem with Secret Agent Super Dragon is the same thing that plagues a lot of these James Bond inspired films ? money . The James Bond movies had the financial backing to pull it off . These Italian movies like Secret Agent Super Dragon can't match that kind of money . As a result , they suffer from weak scripts and acting , a lack of interesting multiple locations , poor special effects , a very anti-climatic ending , and anything else you can spend money on to make a movie better . That's not to say the movie was a total waste . In fact , I enjoyed quite a bit of it . Danton is above average in the title role . He's slick and clever ? just what you would expect from a secret agent . Marisa Mell and Margaret Lee would give any Bond girl a run fir her money . Finally , there is a sense of fun about the movie that I liked a lot . Those behind the movie were smart enough to never take it too seriously . As a result , the movie's light , almost bubbly , feeling is an asset .
366594	3109237	60782	4.0	Raquel and nothing else	- Two brothers fight to succeed their father as the leader of a tribe of cavemen . Along the way , the run into dinosaurs , an earthquake , and Raquel Welch . - I've always found this movie a fairly boring affair . The story is uninvolving , much of the acting is very stiff , and it doesn't help matters that not a word of English ( or any other language ) is spoken in the entire movie . There are some Ray Harryhausen special effects , but they seem out of place here . The best thing that can be said about One Million Years B . C . is that it launched the career ( big time ) of Raquel Welch . - To sum it up , other than the Harryhausen special effects ( and the Raquel Welch special bikini ) there's not much here to enjoy .
366441	3109237	69850	4.0	Did I see this move ?	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie , but this is going to be more difficult than I thought . Honestly , I can't remember much about it . I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me . That's usually the sign of a real stinker . About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it . The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick . It would be different if he could act , but he's a one-note entertainer . The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them . If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see more Euro horror . The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity .
366446	3109237	73327	4.0	If you want to see a good giallo , find another movie	- After you've seen giallo after giallo , you begin to think you've seen it all as far as a convoluted plot goes . But then you stumble upon Autopsy . It's got to be the King of the Bizarre Plot . I'm not going to even attempt to go into it in detail because it's so twisted and things come out of left field that I could never do it justice . Just try to enjoy it for what it is . - But the plot isn't where the majority of my problems with Autopsy lie . Instead , I have a real problem with the cast - specifically Mimsy Farmer as the female lead . Unlike Suzy Kendall in Torso or Edwige Fenech in All the Colors of the Dark , Mimsy Farmer and her character are not sympathetic figures . In order for a giallo to work and work well , the viewer must care about the characters who are in danger . I felt nothing for Mimsy . In fact , I was hoping she would be killed off very early in the movie . - Other things I didn't care for were Mimsy's visions of the morgue patients moving around . It didn't really serve much of a purpose and didn't really go anywhere . Also , the director's decision to show up-close shots of solar flares over and over was totally unnecessary . Again , it didn't really serve much of a purpose and didn't really go anywhere . - There are a lot of good gialli to track down if you're new to the genre . Autopsy , unfortunately , isn't one of them .
366363	3109237	53902	4.0	This one fails at almost every turn	What an average , ordinary movie . And by average and ordinary , I mean dull . The plot revolves around a traveling show in the old West . The group runs afoul of Indians , sheriffs , and killers as they seek to make their fortunes . Sophia Loren is the star and is in almost every scene , but not even she can save Heller in Pink Tights from achieving nothing more than mediocrity . Anthony Quinn is also top billed , but he is terribly underutilized and looks like he's just going through the motions . The chemistry between the pair is non-existent . The only bright spot in the cast is Eileen Heckart who , as usual , steals every scene in which she appears . Director George Cukor shot Heller in Pink Tights in the most gaudy of color schemes that hardly seems natural give the time period in which the movie takes place . An exploding paint store wouldn't produce this much color . I'm not sure what Cukor was going for , but he failed at almost every turn . In short , this one should be reserved for Cukor or Loren completists only .
366228	3109237	59440	4.0	Based on everything I knew about it , I thought this one was destined to be a winner	Over the years , I've gotten pretty good at spotting movies I know I'm going to enjoy . While many of these don't turn out to be in my Top 10 or anything , I generally find these movies enjoyable at a minimum . That's not the case with At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul . Given its cult following , subject matter , and recommendations from trusted individuals , I thought this one was destined to be a winner . I couldn't have been more wrong . At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul is the first of the Brazilian Coffin Joe films . Jose Mojica Marins is Zé do Caixão , the mortician in a small town he holds sway over through physical and psychological threats . He's not above committing murder to get his way . The film has a lot of surreal imagery going for it that is interesting to look at . It's too bad that it's all for naught as the film is so deadly dull . All the interesting set decoration and eye candy in the world can't save it . Zé makes an interesting character , but he hardly looks like the big tough guy , bullying around everyone in town . He's more like a skinny little kid playing dress-up with a cape and top hat who throws tempter tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants . I still don't understand why a couple of the husky Brazilian townsfolk didn't get together and beat the snot out of Zé . Finally , there's the ending . After and hour and some odd minutes of At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul , I hoped my experience could be salvaged by a strong finale . Again , I was disappointed . That has to be one of the more unsatisfying endings I've seen recently . Despite what I've written , I haven't given up on Coffin Joe just yet . I still plan to give This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse a chance . I only hope its better .
366176	3109237	116654	5.0	" I wanna go to Dog Heaven ! "	Where to start with this bizarre modern-day retelling of the H . G . Wells ' classic ? In many respects , The Island of Dr . Moreau is a train wreck of a movie . On so many levels , it's an unmitigated disaster . The problems on the set with the cast and crew are legendary . People getting fired , others getting mad and walking off , and some distracted by personal issues ? it must have been like living a soap opera . Maybe it's all these competing issues that helps to make what should be an unwatchable mess so interesting . For all its faults , The Island of Dr . Moreau is actually quite an enjoyable experience . Bizarre would be a good word to describe much of The Island of Dr . Moreau ? and I'm not just talking about the events in the movie's plot . The characters are just plain weird . Each appears to be competing with the other to be the most bizarre . David Thewlis ' Edward Douglas goes through range of emotions including fear , lust , anger , and disinterest . If it weren't for Marlon Brando , Val Kilmer's Montgomery would be one of the strangest characters in movie history . He's like some sort of butch game-keeper with a death wish . But Brando is in the movie and his Dr . Moreau tops everyone . The scene with Brando in a muumuu and an ice bucket hat is a sight that must be seen to be believed . Words cannot do it justice . Add to that the variety of half-man , half-animal creatures on the island and you've got one strange collection of characters . Speaking of the creatures , the make-up effects are the film's strongest assets . Some , like Hyena or the Sayer of the Law , are as good examples of creature make-up as you'll see . These effects do add a certain creepiness to the whole thing ( that is if you can keep from laughing at Brando's latest get-up ) . Despite enjoying much of the movie , I cannot call The Island of Dr . Moreau a particularly " good " movie ? not in the traditional sense anyway . The movie has too many problems to do that . The movie is terribly paced , any attempts at drama or horror are usurped by the ridiculousness of the characters , some of the special effects look like they came from a Nintendo 64 , and , frustratingly , none of the characters demonstrate anything remotely resembling common sense . As much as I hate to do it , but because of my mixed feelings , I feel forced to give The Island of Dr . Moreau a very wishy-washy .
366702	3109237	68577	5.0	Not even Peter Cushing can save this one	Fear in the Night is a very seldom discussed Hammer film with Peter Cushing and Joan Collins .

A good portion of the screenplay consists of various characters walking around the school . Just walking . Nothing really happens to them . They just walk . The movie is not , though , without its good points . The finale presents a nice twist that , although fairly predictable , is well done . I can't really recommend this to anyone other than Peter Cushing or Hammer completest . For what it's worth , I give this one a .
366694	3109237	56633	5.0	Why do people in horror movies insist on staying in creepy old castles ?	- After running out on an unpaid hotel bill , a bus carrying five showgirls , their manager , and a driver becomes stranded because of bad weather . They seek shelter in a nearby castle ( Is it a European custom to ask any stranger with a spooky castle if you can spend the night when you're stranded ? ) . At first , the owner , Count Gabor Kernassy , is reluctant to let them stay , but eventually changes his mind after noting that one of the girls looks like a dead relative . During dinner , the Count tells his guests that they must remain in their rooms at night . Unfortunately for Playgirl Katia , she didn't listen and begins exploring ( What a shocker ! ) the castle after everyone has gone to bed . The next morning , her dead body is found on the castle's grounds . Was it an accident or was she murdered ? And who else will die in Castle Kernassy ? - Let's get this out of the way up-front , The Playgirls and the Vampire is remembered for one thing - it was one of the first Italian horror movies ( if not the very first ) to mix nudity with horror . As a curiosity piece , it's interesting , but it's hardly the basis for a good movie . If you're interested in a slow moving Italian Gothic horror , there are far better movies to be found than this one . The Playgirls and the Vampire moves too slowly for even the most patient and disciplined fan . The first can best be described as drudgery . - The American title is a bit misleading . It suggests that the movie's plot is about a group of scantily clad women being terrorized by a vampire . Let's see , one woman is bitten and the vampire is one of the least threatening I've ever seen . Walter Brandi plays the vampire ( and the Count ) and his performance is best described as stiff . He acts like his arms might fall off if he moves too quickly . The Playgirls in the title are the most untalented group of showgirls ever assembled . And the emotions they feel for their fallen comrade consist of rehearsing their sad dance routine within minutes of the funeral . - The movie does pick-up the pace and become fairly entertaining for the last of the running time . The underground passages are creepy and provide the only atmosphere to be found . The final fight between the two vampires is enjoyable in a campy / cheesy sort of way . This portion of the movie saves it from becoming a total waste of time . - If any of this sounds interesting , I recommend watching Bloody Pit of Horror instead . The plots are almost identical ( just replace a homicidal lunatic for the vampire ) , but Bloody Pit of Horror is so much more fun .
366379	3109237	388230	5.0	A wishy-washy	A mother and daughter , coming home from a softball game , decide to stop for ice cream . Their plans change when a bank robber on the run kidnaps them and forces the mother to drive him to an abandoned house his gang is using as a meeting place . What the would-be criminals don't know is that their hideout is just over the hill from an abandoned slaughterhouse that's home to a crazed , psychopathic killer . Guilty or innocent , it doesn't really matter to this hooded killer ? he wants ' em all dead ! I've seen several reviews that use the word " derivative " when describing Malevolence . In fact , the director , Stevan Mena , uses it himself in one of the special features on the DVD . I cannot think of a better word . Malevolence is derivative of every slasher that came before it . There's very little originality in much of what's presented on screen . Take the music . I don't see how anyone could listen to Malevolence's soundtrack and not be immediately reminded of Halloween . Even the music cues are the same . I realize that when you're working with something as tired as a slasher , it's got to be hard to come up with a movie full of original ideas , but I'm not sure Mena even tried . But I've got to give Mena and Malevolence credit for a few things . First , there's the plot . I do appreciate the fact that Mena tried to do something rather unique and shift gears about 30 minutes into the movie . On the DVD , he claims to have been inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho . Whatever , it was an interesting move on his part . Second , I really like the authentic locations Mena chose for Malevolence . There's nothing like a real , old , crumbling slaughterhouse as a setting for your slasher . The location does give the film some atmosphere and a very creepy look . Finally , I like the way Mena has us as an audience rooting for the bad guys . Mena manipulates the audience to actively cheer for the characters who are essentially the bad guys in the first act of the movie . Sure , bank robbers and kidnappers aren't the kind of people I want to invite over for dinner , but I'll take them over a mindless killer any day . In the end , I can't really call Malevolence good , but I've certainly seen much worse . I appreciate some of the ideas Mena had for his film , but overall it lacks originality in its execution . However , I would be interested in seeing what Mena does next .
366357	3109237	71987	5.0	Maybe I should re-watch this one now that I know what to expect .	Giacomo Solaris ( Franco Nero ) has just made a film about the hypocrisy in the judicial system focusing on one particular judge and his ties with the Mafia . As life often imitates art , the real life judge he used as a basis for his character is brutally murdered just as in his movie . Solaris begins to weave his way through a web of corrupt politicians , mobsters , and those with a grudge against the judge to find the killer . My rating for How to Kill a Judge is probably not a very good indicator as to the quality of this film . It's not that How to Kill a Judge is all that bad or anything , it's just that I was hoping for a different movie . How to Kill a Judge is a fairly entertaining drama with interesting characters , good locations , and a nice twist at the end . Franco Nero is as solid as ever and his scenes with Francoise Fabian are the standout moments of the film . There's some real chemistry between the two . The simplicity of the ending was refreshing , especially after having watched Franco go through the complicated and tangled web to reach the finale . But , as I said , this is not the movie I wanted . I was hoping for an over-the-top polizia thriller similar to something like Syndicate Sadists or Almost Human . Instead of an action packed cop film , How to Kill a Judge is so dialogue heavy that it often gets dull . And , it doesn't help anything that the movie goes off in several different directions without any real purpose . A tighter script and a little more action would have gone a long way to making How to Kill a Judge the movie I was looking for .
366201	3109237	53219	5.0	" I know something terrible happened , something even more terrible than suicide or murder "	Following the death of his mother , Philippe Delambre ( Brett Halsey ) decides to continue the work his father began 15 years previous . His father's experiments in matter transference ended disastrously . Philippe promises his uncle , Francois Delambre ( Vincent Price ) , he'll be more careful and not make the same mistake that took his father's life . But as luck would have it , Philippe is destined to the same horrible fate . Through a one in a million accident , he's turned into a half fly , half human . Though he wasn't able to help Philippe's father , maybe this time Uncle Francois can find the fly and save Philippe . Return of the Fly is a quick and cheap follow-up to The Fly . Though there are things to enjoy , it's something of a disappointment given the original . The sequel lacks the mystery of the first movie . In this one , we are expected to just accept the whole transference process and that a man can be turned into a fly . No suspense , no atmosphere ? nothing . And what about the son Philippe meeting the same fate as his father ? I called it a million to one accident ? well it's probably more like a trillion to one . Can't the Delambre family get some pest strips or hire an exterminator or something ? The notion of a fly getting in the transference machine twice is ridiculous . There are other problems ( the fly special effects and the theft subplot for example ) , but these are the two things that bothered me the most . Oh , but it's not all bad . The acting is okay . I've never been much of a fan of Brett Halsey , but here he's actually good . Vincent Price is always enjoyable even when , as here , he doesn't have much of anything to do . Also , the scenes of the fly stalking his prey in the funeral home are effective . I'll admit that I jumped every time he popped out of the shadows . Finally , despite the movie's problems and shortcomings , it's still fairly fun . As I've written any number of times now , entertainment is the most important thing when it comes to a movie for me . And while I wasn't bowled over or anything by Return of the Fly , I still had a decent time with it .
366780	3109237	52829	5.0	Despite its shortcomings , its a " must see " for krimi fans	While I enjoy watching these German-made krimis , I've yet to find one that I just love and can recommend without hesitation . That holds true with Fellowship of the Frog . The best I can say is that it's about average . The plot is twisted and nonsensical like you'll find in most krimis . I won't even attempt to go into it other than to say it involves a masked criminal known as The Frog who , with his seemingly endless supply of flunkies , is responsible for a string of robberies and murders in London . For reasons only he knows , the Frog seems to have set his sights on a young woman named Ella Bennet and kidnaps her brother Ray to get to her . It's up to Scotland Yard and an amateur detective named Richard Gordon to put a stop to this devious criminal . There are several things in Fellowship of the Frog to enjoy . The film gets off to a nice start . It's appropriately dark and foggy with the requisite smoky ( though unmemorable ) jazz score playing in the background all helping to create a nice sinister atmosphere . The movie features a couple of faces familiar to even a novice fan of krimis like myself ? Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddi Aren't ( I'm sorry about the apostrophe , but the IMDb spell-checker seems intent on putting it there ) . While both are quite good , I especially enjoyed Aren't's unusually quiet performance as the all-knowing butler James . However when the second act begins , most of the good feelings I was having toward Fellowship of the Frog came to an end . To call the second act slow would be a gross understatement as the movie all but grinds to a halt . I had to go back and play a couple of scenes over to make sure I hadn't missed anything as my mind wandered . Fortunately , my persistence was rewarded with a delicious twist near the end that's as shocking as any I've seen recently . It almost saves Fellowship of the Frog from mediocrity . One final note , I understand from doing a little research that this movie is notable for being the first of the Edgar Wallace based krimis produced in the 50s and 60s . Because of that fact , and regardless of the film's shortcomings , Fellowship of the Frog is necessary viewing for anyone calling themselves a fan of these movies .

As long as the action is centered on the racetrack , Cars is good and entertaining . Unfortunately , there's that whole middle hour or so where things get incredibly dull . After the slam-bang start , the next hour is talk , talk , and more talk . I took my three year-old to see the movie and both he and I were squirming about half way through . I had to bribe him to get him to stay through the finish . The problem with much of the film is that it's so predictable . There are no surprises anywhere in the bland and tired script . I'll give the makers of the film credit for one thing ? Cars looks good . There was a time when I thought Toy Story was the be all , end all of computer animation . I couldn't have been more wrong . Cars looks far better in comparison . Finally , one of the great things about the Disney films of the past is how well they have withstood the test of time . I wonder if some of these newer Pixar films will do the same . For example , Cars features Darrell Waltrip doing the same lame shtick he uses when broadcasting a race of television . How well is " Boogity Boogity Boogity ! Let's go racin ' ! " going to stand-up ?
366442	3109237	62808	5.0	Franco's Spy Film	- Since I recently watched Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik , I had an urge to see some other , lesser known spy movies . This is Jess Franco's attempt at the genre and he almost pulls it off . If it weren't for some lapses in action ( and logic ) this one would have been very good . But far too often , nothing much of interest is going on . In a typical James Bond movie , there are many instances where the action stops to further the plot . In The Girl from Rio , these stops in the action do nothing to advance the story . They are just there . - Franco probably had one of the bigger " name " casts in The Girl from Rio that he ever worked with . Shirley Eaton , from Goldfinger , is the villainous Sumuru . George Sanders , who I always get a kick out of watching , is very funny as the equally villainous Sir Masius . The biggest problem with the casting is Richard Wyler as the films hero . He's not interesting enough to carry the part . - Having watched a few Franco movies over the past few years , The Girl from Rio is decidedly tame . While the movie has its moments , the usual Franco sleaze is not evident . Too bad - it might have made some of the non-action moments more tolerable .
366818	3109237	76825	5.0	Can you say " sleaze " ?	- It will be difficult , but I'll try to keep the plot description as brief as possible . The movie opens with shots of a tiger shark . Next we see our main character , Steve , who meets and has sex with Patricia . Patricia leaves Steve for Miguel . Steve gets into a fight with Miguel that only serves to push Patricia and Miguel closer . After a night of sex with Miguel , a tiger shark kills Patricia . More scenes of a tiger shark . Miguel and Steve become friends and meet two girls , Kelly and Cynthia . They have sex with the girls . One night the girls decide to have a party on Steve's boat . Steve becomes furious and kicks them off the boat . Oh , I think I saw a tiger shark ! Next , Steve and Miguel meet Gabriella . Soon , Steve , Miguel , and Gabriella are living together , playing together , and having sex together . Gabriella buys three wedding rings and the group becomes unofficially married . A tiger shark kills Miguel and Gabriella leaves because their threesome has come to an end . Cue the scenes of the tiger shark . Steve now meets Girl from the Bar # 1 and # 2 . They go to a party where Steve trades them for his old lovers , Kelly and Cynthia . Everyone decides to get naked and swim to Steve's boat . Cynthia and Girl from the Bar # 2 don't make it . Can you say " tiger shark " ? Finally , Steve battles the tiger shark for 3 or 4 minutes . The End . ( Okay , so that wasn't very brief . ) - Tintorera is a nice example of trash cinema at its finest . It's one of the sleaziest movies I've seen . It's hard to watch Tintorera and not feel dirty . I don't care how it's listed on IMDb , Tintorera is really soft-core porn with a few scenes of a tiger shark thrown in so it could be marketed as horror movie and a Jaws rip-off . Throughout most of the movie we're treated to scene after scene of people in little or no clothing , both male and female , drinking , smoking , and having sex . When they aren't busy doing this , Miguel and Steve enjoy lounging around in their Speedos drinking , smoking , and discussing having sex . In fact , and I'm not exaggerating , Miguel's naked butt has more screen time than the tiger shark . These people are so busy porking one another that it takes them forever to realize that their friends are being killed . And , as the scenes of the tiger shark are so infrequent , I almost forgot about it too . - When we do see the tiger shark ripping people apart , it's surprisingly well done . I would go so far as to say that it surpasses even Jaws in the gory depiction of a shark attack . The sight of a tiger shark swimming with Miguel's head in it's mouth is as horrific as anything in most any other shark movie I've seen . And it's not just the sharks doing the killing . The animal killing in Tintorera is more plentiful than in a lot of the other , better known , exploitation movies of the 70s . In their spare time , Miguel and Steve enjoy shooting sharks in the head and spearing barracudas . The movie shows literally dozens of sharks , turtles , and assorted fish being killed . It's really nasty stuff . - Finally , a word about the rating I've given Tintorera . I'll admit that it's really not a very good movie . But , I couldn't bring myself to rate it any lower because it kept me interested and amused throughout . It's a lot like a car wreck ? it's difficult to look away . - Okay , I'm going to go take a bath .
366885	3109237	73275	5.0	Not all Peter Cushing performances were created equal .	I'll keep this brief as there is really not much to say about this movie . The Legend of the Werewolf is a fairly enjoyable , although predictable , Hammeresque werewolf movie . The story is decent , just not overly original . There's very little in the way of new ground covered here . It's all " been there , done that " type stuff . The werewolf makeup is the real strong point to this movie . One of the best I've ever seen , which is surprising considering Legend of the Werewolf's relative obscurity . Other than that , I don't have much positive to say . Peter Cushing made several bad movies in his carrier , but he usually was able to rise above it and give terrific performances . Not here . In my opinion , this is one of the only movies I can think of where Cushing appears to be just going through the motions .
366272	3109237	751469	5.0	What happened to The Hoard ?	" Daughter of Pomira " is one of those Xena episodes that I don't really enjoy . Episodes that center on a sentiment , family , or lesson type plot tend to be among my least favorite . Basically , the more an episode is based in reality , the less I tend to go for it . Give me the far out mythical stuff or give the comedy and songs or give me the more horrific and outrageous episodes ? just don't give me an episode with a life lesson . It's not that " Daughter of Pomira " is awful ( I've yet to see an episode of Xena that I thought was awful ) , it's just never going to make it onto my list of favorites anytime soon . But I've got a bigger problem with " Daughter of Pomira " than the attempt at a touching plot . My problem is with the handling of The Hoard . When The Hoard first appeared in Season 3's " The Price " , I loved it . An unstoppable , barbaric killing machine ! How awesome was that ? The whole episode was played as if Xena was truly terrified of what might become of her and Gabrielle if The Hoard were to get hold of them . Until last night , I had never seen " Daughter of Pomira " , so I was very excited to see the return of The Hoard . But this wasn't the same Hoard depicted a season earlier . This Hoard was ready to make peace ? not cut the throats out of their enemies . This Hoard looked on as Xena fought one of her own men ? not take them both and skin them alive . Essentially , this is an emasculated version of the Season 3 Hoard . While I can certainly understand The Hoard leader's desire to get his daughter , he would have ripped apart anything standing in his way . I'm not familiar enough with Season 5 and 6 to know if The Hoard made a return appearance . I just hope that if they did , it's The Hoard of " The Price " and not The Hoard of " Daughter of Pomira " .
366294	3109237	53800	5.0	What does it say about a movie when Joan Collins is one of the best things its got going for it .	Esther and the King may appear unusual if you take a look at the usual things I write about . But because Mario Bava was so heavily involved with the film , I just had to give it a go . While the visuals may not be as vivid and exaggerated as some of the films he had more control over , you can see his influences if you look closely . There are several scenes that demonstrate Bava's use of color . One very brief scene early in the film shows the palace guards turning a wheel to close the gates . This scene that lasts less than 10 seconds is lit in very dramatic style with a wash of green and red . It's trademark Bava . As for the film , I really didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did . Oh , it's not great by any stretch of the imagination . Esther and the King was part of the flood of Biblical epics that were made in the late 50s to early 60s . Actually , Esther and the King should be called a mini-epic . It's not as sprawling or grand as the big budgeted Hollywood epics . The sets look cheap in comparison and there are no great action sequences . The first half of the film drags by at a snails pace . The final thirty minutes do provide a little suspense and save Esther and the King from becoming a total waste of time . I'm not even going to discuss how well the film follows the Biblical story as that's a topic best covered elsewhere . I've never cared for Joan Collins , but here she's quite good . I found myself believing in her character and rooting her on . Another standout to me is Sergio Fantoni as the evil Haman . The man plays a bad guy to perfection . The rest of the cast is serviceable but not spectacular .
366481	3109237	929560	6.0	A lot of fuss over a book	The problem with the episode numbering gets a bit ridiculous with " Terror on Ice Mountain " . IMDb lists it as Episode 12 when , in fact , it should be Episode 6 . Anyway , in this episode , Cornelius has found 2 , 000 year-old book written by humans about a trip to the zoo where apes are kept in cages . Fearing what would happen if Urko were to get wind of this discovery , Cornelius decides the best thing to do is hide the book . He goes to Jeff and Bill for help in building a hot air balloon to take the book to a mountain top hiding place . In route , Cornelius and Bill are blown off course and crash in the mountains . They are rescued by the wise mountain apes . Unfortunately , one of Urko's ski patrols has also spotted Cornelius and Bill and try to capture them . The mountain apes summon their god , a giant ape named Kygoor , to help Cornelius and Bill escape . The plot description may sound interesting , but " Terror on Ice Mountain " isn't nearly as good as it should have been . The problem ? padding . I would guess that half of the episode consists of poorly drawn scenes of a balloon flying , Cornelius and Bill walking through the snow , or gorillas skiing . The actual action ( and I hesitate to use the word " action " when describing anything in Return to the Planet of the Apes ) is limited to just a few minutes . The mountain apes are an interesting touch . Similar to Tibetan monks , they offer a new twist to the whole Planet of the Apes mythos . However , I'm not sure how Kygoor is supposed to fit into things . Ape history , as presented by Dr . Zaius , doesn't have room for a giant , primitive ape-god like Kygoor .
366560	3109237	699412	6.0	Nice introduction to the series	" The Case of the Cunningham Heritage " is a nice introduction to the 1954 series creatively titled Sherlock Holmes . Ronald Howard plays Holmes and Howard Marion-Crawford is Watson . Both are more than adequate in their roles and present a nice change of pace for viewers more familiar with either the Rathbone films or the Brett television series . Howard gives Holmes a bit more humanity ( for lack of a better word ) than I've seen elsewhere . As for Crawford , fortunately he doesn't play Watson as the bumbling fool as Nigel Bruce often did . The pair is very capably joined by Archie Duncan as Inspector Lastrade . The Lastrade role is much larger than what's often found , but the character makes a nice foil for Holmes . Being the first episode , " The Case of the Cunningham Heritage " is more concerned with character development than anything else . There's a murder , but it's hardly worth going into . The murder and its solution are ancillary to the viewer getting a feel for the characters . I , for one , appreciated this aspect of the episode . It sets a solid foundation for future installments . And , at less than 30 minutes in length , there's not much time for an overly involved mystery anyway . Overall , not a bad way to get things started . I think a is about right for this episode . I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series .
366479	3109237	60457	6.0	It may be stupid , but it's so much fun	I realize that most people who have seen The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini will look at my rating and decide I need to have my head examined . I readily admit that it's one of the stupidest movies I've seen recently . I am perfectly capable of seeing all of the same problems in the movie that all of the other reviews or comments point out . Yes , the beach movie was on its last leg when The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini was made . Yes , there is no plot . Yes , most of the comedy is incredibly lame . Yes , Tommy Kirk is beyond terrible . Yes , Harvey Lembeck was way too old to play a rebellious motorcycle leader . Yes , Benny Rubin's Chicken Feather character is offensive . Yes , Deborah Walley is no Annette Funicello . Yes , Boris Karloff has little more than an extended cameo that almost appears to have been an afterthought . Yes , I see all these problems and more in The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini , but for whatever reason , the movie is still a lot of fun . I had a blast watching Nancy Sinatra sing " Geronimo " . She's just so cool . I also enjoyed watching Basil Rathbone in one of his final performances . He seemed to really be enjoying the chance to ham it up . As goofy as it may sound , I love the fact that The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini takes many of the traditional beach movie trappings and transports them to a big , old haunted house . A swinging 60s style beach party set in Karloff's over-the-top torture chamber is an awesome idea . Finally , I've got to give the movie a bonus point for having a completely unnecessary gorilla . It adds a surreal touch to everything . So , despite the many , many weaknesses and problems in The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini . I still had a great time watching it . I'll continue to say that the entertainment I get out of a movie is more important to me than anything else . And with that in mind , the rating I've given The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini seems about right to me .
366104	3109237	48682	6.0	" You dirty little dumb broad ! "	An undercover female police officer is sent to prison to infiltrate a gang of female convicts and help them escape . By gaining their trust , the police hope that the gang will lead them to a fortune in diamonds buried somewhere in the swamps of Louisiana . But things don't go quite as planned . Greed and lust take over as the women start fighting each other over the diamonds and their male hostage . Call me crazy , but I enjoyed Swamp Diamonds ( or Swamp Women if you prefer ) more than a lot of people seem to . Don't get me wrong , I can see all of the problems with this Roger Corman effort that others have pointed out ? dodgy acting , padding galore , plot holes , etc . And to find any entertainment in the movie , you've got to get past scenes that tend to drag and plod . But once you do , Swamp Diamonds is a joy of 50s exploitation . It's got it all : a crazy story , buried treasure , escaped female convicts , Beverly Garland , guns , over the top acting , short-shorts , alligators , and " Touch " Connors ( " Touch " ? What's up with that ? ) Together , these elements combine to make this one quite a bit of fun . It's not perfect , but I've got no problem rating Swamp Diamonds a . This is another movie that I might not have discovered if it weren't for Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Maybe I was just having fun with the movie , but I'll give this episode of MST3K a ? worth seeking out .
366566	3109237	616905	6.0	Jonny finds a fortune in treasure	At the request of a Central / South American government ( I'm just guessing because I don't remember the actual country being named ) , the Quest Gang travel to do some scientific research at an ancient Mayan city . But they're not alone . An explorer named Perkins is already there looking for a rumored treasure . When Jonny accidentally finds a secret room , it looks like certain death for our heroes . " Treasure of the Temple " may not be the best episode , but it's certainly entertaining enough . There's a certain amount of intrigue that goes into the mysterious occurrences surrounding the Quests ' trip to the archaeological dig . And there's certainly no shortage of dangers ? from spiked traps to alligators to underwater rivers to pyramids to natives to hidden rooms to a fortune in treasure , there's something interesting around every corner . Also , and a real change-of-pace to a lot of the first few episodes of Johnny Quest , " Treasure of the Temple " doesn't feature an Asian or Middle-Eastern bad guy . It's nice to see the writers could turn a white , Anglo Saxon into a killer . Unfortunately for " Treasure of the Temple " , there's nothing " big " to make it stand out from many of the other episodes . There's nothing like the mummy Anubis , for example , to make this episode especially memorable . It's good ? just not great .
366577	3109237	51380	6.0	" You know everyone's seeing satellites these days . "	Nancy Archer ( Allison Hayes ) is a wealthy woman with a cheating husband . But that's really the least of her problems . One night while out in the desert , Nancy runs into a giant from outer space . She is found the next morning unconscious on top of her pool house . While under the care of her doctor , something strange begins to happen to Nancy . She begins to grow . In no time at all , Nancy is as big as the alien she ran into . And at 50 ' tall , there's nothing stopping her from putting a halt to her husband's cheating ways . How in the world can you watch Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman and not have a good time ? I think some people take movies like this too seriously and are so busy analyzing the poor special effects , the cheap sets , the ridiculously large plot holes , the iffy acting , and the rest of what gives this movie its charm that they don't know how to sit back , relax , and just enjoy it . Is Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman good ? Well , no , not in the traditional sense . But I've seen it at least a half a dozen times and it's never failed to entertain . If you enjoy campy 50s movies at all , this is one that's not to be missed . Still not convinced ? Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman also features 50s B-movie icon Allison Hayes in a bed sheet bikini . That's reason enough to tune in !
366151	3109237	63688	6.0	It could have been so much better	Thomas Crown ( Steve McQueen ) is a wealthy man . Wealthy ? yes . Satisfied with life ? no . He needs some excitement in his life . He needs a challenge . Crown concocts a plan to rob a local Boston bank . He hires five men who know nothing of each other to carry out his scheme . Things go just as Crown planned ? Crown has the money , no one was caught , and the police are completely baffled . The perfect crime ! But Crown wasn't counting on the ruthless , hard-nosed insurance investigator ( Faye Dunaway ) sent to find the daring bank robbers . And Crown certainly wasn't expecting the insurance investigator to be so beautiful . The Thomas Crown Affair starts off with a bang . The film opens with an intelligent , well-planned , and cleverly written bank heist . Unfortunately , the bank heist only takes 20 minutes of the film's runtime . The 60s were full of these ingenious crime / caper / heist films and had the remainder of The Thomas Crown Affair lived-up to the promise of the first act , it might have been one of the better examples of the crime / caper / heist film ever made . But things fall apart shortly after Dunaway makes her appearance . She's neither very believable in her role nor do she and McQueen have any on screen chemistry . I will admit that the first meeting between McQueen and Dunaway was interesting , but their cat and mouse game soon gets very tiring . Their scenes together feel forced and unnatural . Many of the reviews on The Thomas Crown Affair highlight " the chess scene " and go so far as to call it " sexy " . If by " sexy " they mean too long , too drawn out , and too dull , then I guess it's " sexy " . Director Norman Jewison seems intent on using every single ridiculous camera trick at his disposal . Split-screens , gel lenses , and psychedelic colors are only a few examples of what Jewison has up his sleeve . Here's an idea ? just tell your story . The camera tricks do nothing but help to destroy whatever flow and pacing the film might have had . A few of these techniques is okay , too many becomes distracting . Other than the opening 20 minute heist scene , the only other real highlight is the film's final twist as Crown pulls the wool over the eyes of the insurance investigator . It's a nice ending for The Thomas Crown Affair and helps to make up for some of what came before . And fortunately for us , it's a signal that we will no longer be subjected to the terrible on screen pairing of McQueen and Dunaway .
366856	3109237	56142	6.0	" You two are going to Farro Island and find me a genuine monster whether he exists or not ! "	Godzilla has escaped his icy prison and is making a beeline for Japan . No one seems to be capable of stopping his progress . In comes an enterprising businessman , Mr . Tako , who has heard rumors of a large monster on a nearby island . His plan is to have a couple of his men go to the island to get this giant beast and use it against Godzilla . The two men find the Farro Island and King Kong . Can Kong stop Godzilla , or will he also become a threat to Japan much like Godzilla ? Please note that my rating is based on the American version of the film . I would really like to see the original Japanese version and may seek it out . From what I've read , the American version cuts a lot of the comedy , especially from Mr . Tako , and inserts the U . N . television reports . Mr . Tako is the highlight of the movie for me , and more Mr . Tako would seem to only make things better . He's hilarious . The U . N . news reports are totally unnecessary . The announcers do little other than describe the upcoming action which the viewer is about to see . There's no real point in much of it . Growing up in the late 60s / early 70s , King Kong vs . Godzilla was standard afternoon television viewing on one of the local channels . I seem to remember it playing a few times each year . And each time I couldn't wait to get home from school to see these two behemoths square off . While I no longer find the final fight scene the most enjoyable part of the movie , it's still one of the best encounters Toho filmed . But the fight scene no longer works for me the way it once did and I no longer consider King Kong vs . Godzilla the best film Toho ever made ( for the record , I now go with either Matanga or Rodan ) .
366075	3109237	597044	6.0	Joe and Frank go to Egypt	On their way to meet their dad , Frank and Joe Hardy ( Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy ) stop off in Egypt for a little sight-seeing . Before you know it , the boys are mixed up in stolen antiquities and a pretty American girl who has been kidnapped . Can the boys put the pieces together to solve The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb ? More importantly , can they clear their own names and get their passports from the local police ? I admit , The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb isn't earth shattering in its originality , but I had a good time re-watching it for the first time in about 30 years . To begin with , the mystery elements are reasonably good . It's a fairly complicated story ( okay , complicated for a Hardy Boys mystery ? it's all relative ) that takes a bit of time to unfold . And secondly , who doesn't enjoy a bit of mysterious ancient Egypt mixed into a mystery ? I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff . My biggest complaint has more to do with the start of Season 2 than it does this particular episode . First it was Transylvania and Dracula ? now it's Egypt and King Tut . What happened to the more homegrown believable mysteries ? Were the producers that desperate for ratings ? While I don't necessarily think any of the first three episodes in Season 2 are particularly bad , none can compete with the majority of episodes from Season 1 .
366912	3109237	241073	7.0	What's the Matter with Jin-Ju ?	Whispering Corridors is a slow moving , but engrossing , ghost story set in an all-girl's school in Korea . There have been a number of Asian horror films released in the U . S . in the past few years , but as this one was made before most , I think of it more as a trend-setter than a copycat . While much of the horror is subtle and implied , there are moments where the horror slaps you in the face with some very vivid imagery . The rest of the story dealing with the relationships between the girls and the teachers is not the normal kind of thing I go for , yet here it's very well done . It doesn't seem as clichéd as most American films dealing with teens seem to be . The acting is top drawer and adds a lot to making the film work . I wish I could point out one or two of the performances that really stand out , but I don't speak Korean and all the names look alike to me . Whispering Corridors probably wouldn't work for those not patient enough to allow the film to slowly unfold . And while I may not have enjoyed it as much as some of the more recent Asian offerings like A Tale of Two Sisters , it's an enjoyable enough experience .
366149	3109237	61409	7.0	Very enjoyable krimi	I'm still relatively new to these krimis , but I rate Creature with the Blue Hand as one of the best I've seen so far . It's the story of man named Dave Emerson ( Klaus Kinski ) who has been committed to an asylum for murdering his family's gardener . Dave escapes and makes his way home ( which is conveniently located a stones throw from the asylum ) and attempts to convince anyone who will listen that he's innocent . But it's difficult for his family and Scotland Yard to believe Dave as the bodies begin to pile-up ? There's certainly plenty to enjoy in Creature with the Blue Hand ? a crazy twin brother , a devilishly sinister medieval glove with retractable spikes , secret passageways , a mad doctor , and enough suspense to keep most fans happy . Creature with the Blue Hand is successful in creating that one ingredient necessary for a film of this type ? atmosphere . The film has a nice pace to it and never seems to drag . The acting is hit or miss at best . Kinski gives a nice , restrained performance . The sets are amazing and far exceed the film's obviously limited budget . Even though the film is set in modern times , the sets would have been perfect for a period piece . The DVD I watched also features an American cut of the film , re-titled The Bloody Dead . This version contains 15 or so minutes of added gore scenes filmed some 20 years after the original movie was made . I haven't watched it yet and , based on everything I've read , I probably never will .
365934	3109237	70633	7.0	A Guilty Pleasure	- A young girl seemingly commits suicide for no reason . Her sister Elizabeth ( Pamela Franklin ) , feeling that something was terribly wrong , takes an assumed name and enrolls at the all-girls ' school her sister attended . In short order , two more girls commit suicide . With the help of her friend Roberta ( Kate Jackson ) she is determined to get at the bottom of what's going on . - Most people I know do not care for this movie as much as I do . Oh , I certainly can see the problems with the movie , but I tend to overlook them . There are a few creepy scenes and I always get hooked by the story ( what little story there is ) . It's kind of like a poor man's Suspiria . Most of the real plot points , however , can be seen a mile away . For example , do you really have to stretch your imagination to guess what might be going on at a 300 year old school in Salem , MA where eight of the former students were accused of being witches ? I know it's a toughy , but just try to guess . Still , this doesn't take away from the fun I always have with Satan's School for Girls . Also , it's a real blast to see future Charlie's Angels Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd before they became famous . - For me , though , it may be more of a nostalgia thing than actually enjoying a good movie . I can remember seeing this when it originally aired in 1973 . I was 9 years old when it aired that September . Satan's School for Girls scared me so bad I couldn't sleep . I really wish they still made TV movies like they did in the 70s .
366255	3109237	68481	7.0	" Hail Diane - Princess of Darkness "	After her mother's untimely and violent death , Diane Shaw ( Belinda Montgomery ) meets a woman named Lilith Malone ( Shelley Winters ) who claims to be one of her mother's old friends . Lilith invites Diane to stay with her for a while . At first things seem almost ideal , but a series of strange events soon puts a different spin on things . Diane decides to leave Lilith's house , but can't seem to escape her control . Is Lilith who and what she claims to be ? Or is she the devil in disguise ? I just love watching Shelley Winters in a movie like this . Although she's in control most of the time , there's at least one scene where Winters loses it that's too much fun . I don't think her turn in The Devil's Daughter is anywhere near her best , but she always a joy . The rest of the cast is good . Jonathan Frid , Abe Vigoda , Diane Ladd , and Joseph Cotton are all good in their respective roles . I also love these 1970s made-for-TV movies . As I wrote in a comment to another Movie of the Week , young people today would be surprised at how much we enjoyed watching these movies . And if it was horror or horror related , it was something we really looked forward to . Movies like Satan's School for Girls , Gargoyles , and The Night Stalker were the highlights of the television schedule . The Devil's Daughter is another fine example of made-for-TV horror . It's not the best of the bunch , but it is effectively creepy in spots . A few of the scenes , like the party Diane attends where she discovers her titular birthright , are eerily reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby . Overall , it's an enjoyable little film ? not great by any stretch of the imagination ? just enjoyable . I would rate it even higher if the screenplay weren't so predictable . I defy anyone who has seen more than a handful of horror to find many surprises in the plot . But even as predictable as the film's climax may be , it's still a trip to watch unfold .
366245	3109237	52227	7.0	The rating for The Space Children is as puzzling to me as any I've run across	I've seen a lot of weird things on IMDb , but the rating for The Space Children is as puzzling to me as any I've run across . 2 . 1 ? ! ? ! I couldn't disagree any more . 2 . 1 is getting close to Manos territory . The Space Children may not be the best movie I've ever seen , but it doesn't deserve a 2 . 1 . Why the low rating ? I blame MST3K . I enjoy the show , but as I've argued any number of times , some of the movies that they lampooned didn't deserve it . Take a look at the reviews on IMDb . You can split them into two wildly divergent groups ? those users who appear to only know The Space Children because of MST3K and those who have seen it on its own . The comments from the MST3K crowd always seem to mention Uncle Fester ( Jackie Coogan ) in a bathing suit as if it's one of the most important moments in the film . In contrast , many of the comments from non-MST3K viewers reminisce about seeing The Space Children during their childhood . Maybe it's not just an MST3K thing but an overall generational thing as well . Whatever , I tend to side with those who enjoy the movie for what it is . And what is it ? The Space Children is a nice little cautionary 50s sci-fi film that speaks to the dangers of nuclear proliferation . Jack Arnold , one of the best genre directors of the 50s , does his usual workmanlike job with the movie . It's not flashy , but it certainly looks good . The Space Children obviously was made on a limited budget . As a result , the special effects are also limited and Arnold focuses more on the people . A lot of what happens is implied . But that's not necessarily a weakness . Too often , low-budget sci-fi films from this period look ridiculous because of the desire for elaborate special effects ( i . e . monster and aliens ) that outstripped the funding it would require . The acting , while not outstanding , is solid . Even the kids , who can be annoying at times in this kind of movie , come off looking pretty good . The cast will be familiar to many who grew up watching television in the 60s . Overall I've got no big complaints with The Space Children . Not a bad way to spend just over an hour .

He quickly latches on to the man who runs the team , Paul Hanlon ( Robert Culp ) , as the primary suspect . But how could Hanlon have committed the murder ? He was at the ballgame at the time it was committed . - The best thing about this The Most Crucial Game is the interaction between Robert Culp and Peter Falk . Culp is great as the suspect who grows more weary of Columbo's continual antics . There are a couple of scenes where Culp looks like he's really ready to blow a fuse . In contract , Falk's Columbo is calm , cool , and collected . Great stuff . - The actual murder is also a thing of genius . Using a block of ice to bash someone in the head while in a swimming pool is a masterful idea . The intended victim is dead and there is no murder weapon . - The weakest point of The Most Crucial Game is unfortunately the ending . It's rather poorly handled . It's almost as if the writers couldn't come up with a good way to end it . The solution is fine , it's just that the revelation of the solution seems very awkward .
366463	3109237	58983	7.0	" My perfect body . . . in the poisonous clutches of The Lover Of Death ! "	- Seeking locations to use for photographs for a series of horror books , a group stumbles on what they believe to be a deserted castle . The castle happens to have been the former home of The Crimson Executioner ? a centuries old murderer who was himself put to death in his own castle , but not before putting a curse on anyone who enters his castle . Of course , the castle isn't deserted , but instead is the home of a retired actor seeking solitude . He allows the group to spend one night and get as many photos as they can . His one request - don't go into the dungeon . Naturally , our group of photographers and models immediately make a beeline for the lower levels of the castle and discover an array of torture devices . The devices , it seems , will make good props for their photos . But something goes wrong and one of the male models is killed by falling spikes . Was it an accident or is there a murderer in the castle ? It's not long before other members of the group begin to disappear . Has The Crimson Executioner come back to make good on his threat ? - I honestly don't know when I've had this much fun watching a movie . In general , I hate the term " so bad it's good " . But in this case , I think it applies like nowhere else . Bloody Pit of Horror has most of the trappings that are present in movies I look for ? a big creepy castle , a dungeon , torture devices , scantily clad women , and a bizarre madman bent on killing everyone . What the movie lacks , however , is effective atmosphere and believability . But , if you don't take things too seriously , it's a nice little ride . - The madman is played by the one time husband of Jayne Mansfield , Mickey Hargitay . Hargitay is one of those Mr . Universe types . While he may not be much of an actor , he is wonderful as The Crimson Executioner . There have been killers in other movies who enjoy their " work " , but none can match the enthusiasm of The Crimson Executioner . Toward the end of the movie , he traps everyone who is still alive in his torture chamber . Watching him literally run and jump from one torture device to the next is like watching a kid on Christmas morning . He actually has an orgasmic look on his face as he puts one of his victims on the rack . And his " costume " is just too much . He wears red tights , a red hood , a black leather belt , and a black mask that covers his eyes . - Another thing to keep an eye ( or ear ) on is the dialogue . The Crimson Executioner has some of the " best " lines I've ever heard . He goes on and on about how perfect his body is . And , how he must kill the people who have come into his castle to preserve the purity of his body . My favorite of these monologues takes place in front of a mirror . As The Crimson Executioner applies a liberal coating of oil to his chest he says , " Mankind is made up of inferior creatures , spiritually and physically deformed , who would have corrupted the harmony of my perfect body . " You just don't hear lines like that in just any old movie - it takes something special like Bloody Pit of Horror - There are so many other points of the movie I would like to write about , but they really must be seen to be believed . For example , The Crimson Executioner has a group of henchmen that dress in matching outfits . It's as if they're appearing on the 1960s Batman television program . Another example , the reaction of the crew after one of their co-workers is killed . Do they immediately leave the castle like normal people would ? No - they decide to finish their work in the castle for extra money and call the police in the morning . Yet another example , the room with the giant spider web , mechanical spider , and arrows that shoot from the wall is simply sublime . I could go on for days .

Benton Quest is deep in the jungle in search of a rare metal that might prove beneficial to the space program when he runs into a hysterical native who will only repeat the word , " Turu " . The Quest Gang accompanies the frightened man and discover a mountain full of the metal they seek guarded by a crazed man in a wheelchair and his giant , flying dinosaur . Overall , Turu the Terrible is a fairly enjoyable episode . Turu actually poses a real threat to the Quests . In one scene , the giant pterodactyl-like dinosaur gets hold of Dr . Quest and almost takes him into its lair . In another scene , the boat the Quests are using sustains heavy damage after an attack . The ending is something of a let-down , however . as we never discover who the old man is or anything else about him . There are also a couple of moments that make me laugh every time I see them . The first is the sight of Race carrying that bazooka while flying with his jet pack . He carries it like it weighs no more than a loaf of bread . And I hope he never intended to fire the thing while flying . The kick while floating in mid-air would knock him clear out of the jungle . The second thing I get a chuckle out of is the image of the wheelchair-bound old man leading his pet dinosaur to its cage . Yeah , right .
366397	3109237	74279	7.0	A Nice Ride	- The basic premise of Cannonball has been done several times - a diverse group of drivers compete in a cross-country race where anything goes . Sound familiar ? Hal Nedham ripped the guts out of Cannonball for his Cannonball Run made five years later . The difference , though , is that while Cannonball is often funny with some great action , Cannonball Run is often too over-the-top and unwatchable . It's too bad that Bartel's movie isn't as well known as Nedham's . While it will never be confused with Citizen Kane , Cannonball is a thrill-a-minute , cheese-filled good time . - Bartel's direction is one of the highlights of the movie . You would think that a 90 + minute movie of watching cars race might get boring . It's not . Bartel keeps things moving and there's never a dull moment . Bartel does a great job of mixing race action , comedy , fight scenes , and a little drama to create a well-balanced , enjoyable movie . - As far as acting goes , David Carradine naturally stands out . He's a car driving , butt kicking machine . Carradine is able to add a little authenticity to the movie by doing a lot of his own driving . There are a couple of spinouts where you can actually see that it's Carradine sitting behind the wheel . - My biggest complaint with Cannonball involves the spectacular pile-up at the end of the movie . It gets off to a good start with cars plowing into each other followed by explosion after explosion . The problem is that it goes on for so long that it started to have a morbid feel to it . It bothered me that , as a viewer , I could only assume that there were people supposedly driving those cars that were bursting into flames and I didn't see any survivors . I can only assume that everyone was burned to a crisp . Sure it's a little picky , but it bothered me .
366147	3109237	33723	7.0	One of A & C's better films	- Abbott and Costello ( A & C ) get mixed up with a gangster and become his sole heirs upon his death . The estate consists of an old roadside inn that may or may not be the hiding place for the gangster's money . But , there are a lot of other people who want to get their hands on that money - and some of them may be ghosts . - I have seen some people who claim that this is the best movie A & C made . While I don't necessarily agree with that , it's a solid effort . The mix of A & C , an old dark house , ghosts , gangsters , and a good supporting cast are a sure fire winner . - The supporting cast is stronger her than in many of the movies A & C made . On hand are Richard Carlson , Evelyn Ankers , and Marc Lawrence . But Joan Davis comes out looking the best . She's an actress who I've never really cared for , but in Hold That Ghost she makes the perfect companion for A & C . One of my favorite bits is the dance scene with her and Costello . Funny stuff .
366742	3109237	67630	7.0	Twisted and Fun	A group of young motorcycle thugs , getting their kicks by terrorizing their community ( what else would they do ) , discover that if someone commits suicide with the unwavering belief that they will come back , they will arise from the dead . And the coolest part is that once you're dead , you can't be killed again . But will it work and will they really be invincible ? IMDb lists Psychomania as a horror movie . And if you go into it thinking you're going to see a lot of creepy images and a bucket of gore , you would be mistaken and most probably disappointed . While there are certainly elements of horror to be found in Psychomania , it's really underrated black comedy that's much better than its 4 . 8 IMDb rating would indicate . Some of the set-pieces and moments in the film are so twisted and outrageous in their presentation that I actually found myself laughing out loud a few times . The variety of ways the gang members select to kill themselves are a hoot . My favorite is the guy who throws himself in the river . The acting is at least adequate and most of it's played straight which helps punctuate the absurdity of the situations . The only real " name " in the cast is an aging George Sanders who gives an incredibly witty performance . The biggest downside I see to Psychomania is the lack of direction the gang seems to have . You are immortal and no one can hurt you , but the best you can come up with is riding your motorcycles through a grocery store to terrorize old ladies . Surely there's something more sinister or , at least , profitable that you could be doing .
366431	3109237	74593	7.0	" If ya feel a wet snout in ya face , whatever you do , don't move . And don't kiss it back ' cause it ain't me . "	Has there ever been a movie that spawned more imitators than Jaws ? I've lost count at the number of Jaws " inspired " films I've seen over the years . Grizzly is not only one such movie but it happens to hold the distinction of being the first movie to hop on board the Jaws moneytrain . The comparisons with Jaws are almost endless . Characters , plot points , and set-pieces are almost identical . Here are a few examples : - Jaws ? An abnormally large , man-eating shark with above average intelligence terrorizes swimmers . - Grizzly ? An abnormally large , man-eating bear with above average intelligence terrorizes campers . - Jaws ? For the first of the movie , the shark is kept mainly off-screen with only a quick shot or two of a fin . - Grizzly ? For the first of the movie , the bear is kept mainly off-screen with only a quick shot or two of a paw . - Jaws ? The movie features scenes of frightened swimmers literally tripping over themselves getting out of the water to escape the shark . - Grizzly ? The movie features scenes of frightened campers literally tripping over themselves getting out of the woods to escape the bear . - Jaws - Police Chief Martin Brody argues endlessly with Mayor Larry Vaughn about the need to close the beaches . - Grizzly - Ranger Michael Kelly argues endlessly with National Park Supervisor Charley Kittridge about the need to close the campgrounds . - Jaws ? For whatever reason , the shark attacks and destroys a wooden pier . - Grizzly ? For whatever reason , the bear attacks and destroys a wooden fire tower . - Jaws ? Three men ( Police Chief Martin Brody , scientist Matt Hooper , and boat captain Quint ) set out for one final showdown with the shark . - Grizzly ? Three men ( Ranger Michael Kelly , naturalist Arthur Scott , and helicopter pilot Don Stober ) set out for one final showdown with the bear . - Jaws ? Bait is dragged behind the boat to attract the shark . - Grizzly ? Bait is dragged behind a horse to attract the bear . - Jaws ? In the end , the shark is " blowed-up real good " . - Grizzly ? In the end , the bear is " blowed-up real good " . By listing these comparisons , I don't mean to imply that Grizzly is a horrible movie or not entertaining . In fact , as far as Jaws rip-offs go , Grizzly is one of the better examples I've seen . For the most part , it's good , cheesy fun . If you're a fan of this kind of stuff , Grizzly is worth a watch . But beyond the cheese , there are some actual solid elements of the movie that should be mentioned . The cinematography , settings , and Andrew Prine's performance are very unexpectedly solid and highlights of the movie for me . Not having seen the movie in 20 or so years , I was surprised by how much blood and gore are actually seen in Grizzly . And , I can really appreciate the difficulties faced by the cast and crew of using a real , half-trained grizzly . That took some guts . The new 30th Anniversary 2-disc DVD set is a great , surprising treat for fans . It's loaded with a nice transfer , commentary , a couple of " making of " features , and other goodies . It's some good stuff . But my favorite part of the bonus material is an interview with one of the writers when he talks about how original his ideas were for Grizzly . Uhm ? Yeah ? Sure ? Whatever Dude !
366836	3109237	78405	7.0	70s Sleaze	- A mad killer wearing a ski mask commits a series of violent murders using the contents of his toolbox as weapons . After a teenage girl is kidnapped , the police seem to think her brother is responsible . Can he find his sister and save his own neck in the process ? - If I could use one word to describe The Toolbox Murders it would be " sleaze " . It's the kind of movie that you want to take a shower after watching . That's not to say I don't enjoy the movie , because I do . The film thrives on blood , nudity , torture , and a variety of inventive kill scenes . Although the nailgun scene may be the most famous , a claw hammer makes for a nasty weapon . - But the main reason to watch is Cameron Mitchell . Here's a little tip for those unfamiliar with Mitchell - if you're watching a horror movie from the 60s or 70s and Cameron Mitchell shows up , expect him to go nuts and start killing people . Mitchell plays a crazy nut-job as good as anyone I've ever seen . He's just a blast to watch . - The rest of the cast is an odd mix of actors . Aneta Corsaut was Helen Crump , Andy Taylor's girlfriend on " The Andy Griffith Show " . Wesley Eure was in one of my Saturday morning favorites , " Land of the Lost " . And Pamelyn Ferdin was the little girl in just about every television show made in the 60s and 70s . Odd cast , but it works for me .
366254	3109237	74512	7.0	" Well even fish smells good when you're starving to death . "	Blanche and George ( Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern ) are small time operators who use Blanche's supposed abilities as a medium to con trusting old souls out of a few dollars . Their latest mark has agreed to give them $10 , 000 if they can help her locate a long lost family member . Meanwhile , successful jewelry merchant Arthur ( William Devane ) and girlfriend Fran ( Karen Black ) have made something of a career of kidnapping wealthy individuals and ransoming them for diamonds . As luck would have it , the trail of the missing relative leads to Arthur . Not knowing what the pair of would-be detectives is up to and assuming the worst , Arthur quite naturally decides that he and Fran must put a stop to Blanche and George's snooping . I'm joining the chorus singing the praises of Family Plot . Like a lot of others , I think it gets a bad rap . Sure , it's not the best thing Hitchcock ever directed , but come on , it's still a very entertaining , funny movie . It may lack the nail-biting , gut-wrenching suspense of Notorious and the horrific elements and images of Psycho , but it was never meant to be like those two films . Besides , I don't want to see the same movie over and over anyway . What's wrong with a little diversity and a change of pace ? I've always thought Hitchcock did a great job with Family Plot . He manages to take two completely different plot lines and seamlessly and expertly merge them together . He mixes just the right amount of generally understated comedy with a thrilling conclusion . Ernest Lehman's screenplay is smart and filled with some terrifically dark humor that almost always hits the nail on the head . The film may run long for a comedy at 121 minutes , but I can't think of a wasted scene or moment that should have been cut out . I also like the way the audience is allowed to play along with the movie . The audience discovers plot points right along with the characters . There are no " cheats " . But as much as I enjoy the script and as talented as Hitchcock my have been , it's the cast that makes Family Plot really special . From Karen Black's cool entrance in the black trench coat and hat to William Devane's toothy and creepy smile to Bruce Dern's wild hair and constant fidgeting with his pipe to Barbara Harris ' hysterical and manipulative séance scenes , I really cannot pick a favorite . They are all equally fantastic . And , I cannot imagine Family Plot without even one of this quartet of actors . In the end , Family Plot is a neat little movie . It may not be Hitchcock's best or most suspenseful or most horrific or most dramatic , but it just might be amongst his most fun .
366870	3109237	391198	7.0	Some very creepy moments	- The film's title refers to a Japanese myth involving the spirits of people who have died in " the grip of a powerful rage " . Anyone who comes into contact with these spirits will die . The plot of The Grudge is very simple . An American exchange student , Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , living in Japan takes a job with a health care center . When one of the other workers doesn't show up , Karen is given her first solo assignment helping an older lady in her home . When Karen arrives , she immediately realizes that something is not quite right . What she doesn't realize is that this house is possessed by spirits who will kill anyone who sets foot inside . - Let me start by saying that I have not ( as of / 05 ) seen the original Japanese version . I plan to do so , hopefully , very soon . With that being said , I enjoyed The Grudge much more than I had expected . This is my first experience with Shimizu as a director , but I came away impressed . His has a nice ability to tell a story regardless of the language . The Grudge is one of the best examples of a non-linear story presentation that I can think of . As the movie progressed , it was a treat to watch Shimizu bring the pieces of the story together . - Another plus for The Grudge was Shimizu's decision ( probably based on budgetary concerns as much as anything ) to primarily use " real " effects and less CGI . The make-up on the Kayoka character , for example , created a far more unsettling image than the use of CGI could have . It was obvious that Kayoka was a real person , not just a computer image . The overuse or inappropriate use of CGI has ruined many modern horror movies . - There were , however , some areas where the movie could have been better . Gellar is one of the most unappealing leads in Hollywood . I've never understood what all the fuss is about . I always found her extremely annoying . - While the movie has many truly creepy ( some were downright scary ) scenes , the movie relies far too heavily on " jump moments " . You know what I mean - a character opens a door and a cat jumps out ( The Grudge actually features a cat jumping out of a closet ) . I've always thought that jump moments were a cheap way to illicit a response from the audience . A few jump moments can be good , but too many just becomes tiring . - Given that I wasn't expecting much , The Grudge was a lot of fun . I am looking forward to the sequel and to going back and discovering the original Japanese film - Ju-on : The Grudge .
366246	3109237	74975	7.0	Low-budget film-making at its best	Wherever they go , the members of the motorcycle club known as The Scorpions seem to wind up the target of local law enforcement . They can't even drive their motorcycles down the road without drawing unwanted ( and unneeded ) attention of the local " pigs " . But things escalate during a Scorpions wedding in the middle of the field . A girl is raped in a nearby barn and the police and the girl's parents blame the bikers . A few of the local yahoos , including the real rapist and the girl's father , decide to take matters into their own hands . Regardless of the Scorpions ' guilt or innocence , the stage is set for a final showdown . Northville Cemetery Massacre proves that you don't need a big budget to be effective . On a budget of about $1 . 58 , Northville Cemetery Massacre is able to be an entertaining , thought provoking , and unique experience . This is low-budget film-making at its best . Northville Cemetery Massacre's got more atmosphere than a movie with 100 times the budget ( actually , I think the movie's low budget helped to contribute to this ) . I usually reserve the word " atmosphere " to describe horror movies , but it is more than appropriate here . The movie comes off as gritty , dirty , and very realistic . Most of the cast is made up of the members of a real biker gang from Detroit . These aren't actors . And while it does show negatively in some scenes , overall , the real bikers add a sense of realism you couldn't get from a bunch of Hollywood actors . They dress , talk , look , and act like bikers . The final showdown is very nicely done with action , gunplay , and blood galore . And I thought the special effects looked great . I wouldn't doubt that most all of that $1 . 58 budget I mentioned went into the final scenes . Finally , another highlight is the score by Mike Nesmith ( yeah , that Mike Nesmith ) . Most similarly budgeted films do not have music this good . If you're into low-budget 70s exploitation , Northville Cemetery Massacre is one you shouldn't miss .
366365	3109237	366292	7.0	A restrained Miike	In Takashi Miike's One Missed Call , there's really very little new ground covered . If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned , long black-haired female ghost , I feel as if I've seen a dozen . Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around , I don't know ( or really care ) . The similarities , though , are undeniable . But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie . Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death . It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films , but for the most part , it works . Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer . One of the best examples is the " ghost in the cupboard " scene . It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare , but it's very effective in generating the desired response . Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital . These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films . Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not , as usual , it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films . One Missed Call is no exception . Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting , the film has a " look " that helps create an atmosphere of dread . The special effects , both visual and sound , are well done . The acting is good . Both of the leads , Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi , are more than adequate . And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension . Overall , it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect . But One Missed Call isn't without its faults . Beyond the " been there , done that " aspects of the plot , the film's pacing could have been better . While the first and third acts are enjoyable , the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit . Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film . A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better . One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved . For example , why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital ? And could the ending have been more confusing ? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale . That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it , but don't ask me what it all meant . Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues .
366491	3109237	33879	7.0	" Terrible ? Is it terrible that I gave him life ? "	After surviving an accidental electrocution , Dan McCormick ( Lon Chaney , Jr . ) comes to the attention of a couple of scientists doing work with the effects of electricity on the human body . While Dr . Lawrence's intentions are very noble and above reproach , Dr . Rigas ( Lionel Atwill ) has other , more " sinister " applications in mind for their experiments . His idea is create , through repeated exposure to extreme levels of electricity , an army of supermen to do his bidding . And Dan McCormick represents the ideal test subject . Man Made Monster might be considered a " lesser " Universal horror film , but it's a good one . I haven't seen it in literally decades and I'm happy to report that it held up rather well . It's not as good as some of Universal's better known films , but it's a solid , entertaining effort . Director George Waggner ( who would go on to direct Chaney in The Wolf Man ) does a marvelous job of keeping things moving at a nice pace . None of the relatively short 59 minutes is wasted . Chaney , always good at playing the sympathetic figure , does so here as well as ever . Atwill has always been underrated in my eyes and he gives one of his most demented performances as Dr . Rigas in Man Made Monster . The special effects are " cool " for the lack of a better word . The glowing Chaney works . Overall , this is one that deserves a much wider audience , especially among horror fans . Even though it's a limited release , hopefully the new R1 DVD release will put Man Made Monster into the hands of more fans .
366472	3109237	67446	7.0	More plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings .	A jewel thief is brutally murdered on a train by a masked assailant . But when the murderer is unable to locate any diamonds , the murderer immediately suspects that the thief's daughter , a Parisian stripper named Nicole ( Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott ) , may have the diamonds . Nicole , however , claims to know nothing of the diamonds . After a series of threats , both verbal and physical , Nicole decides to flee France with a man she hardly knows . The pair begin a seemingly ideal relationship in a secluded seaside village . But Nicole is unaware that the killer has followed her to England and will stop at nothing to get his hands on the diamonds . What a fun Giallo ! Death Walks on High Heels has one of the most convoluted plots I've run into ? even by Giallo standards . While the movie may lack the quantity of murder scenes found in other Gialli ( although at least one murder scene is as violent as they come ) , Death Walks on High Heels makes up for this shortcoming with more plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings . It had me guessing ( incorrectly , I might add ) up to the very end . It's all about the mystery and director Luciano Ercoli skillfully casts the shadow of suspicion on just about everyone in the cast . Much of the movie is told quite nicely in flashbacks with bits and pieces of the story being revealed as each person confesses to what they may or may not have seen . There's even a pair of bumbling Scotland Yard detectives who are ( surprise , surprise ) actually funny . Overall , Death Walks on High Heels is very well done . The acting is a notch or two above what I've come to expect in a Giallo . The highlight , at least for me , is Nieves Navarro . She is amazing as Nicole . I didn't think I would ever say this , but I think she might have been capable of challenging Edwige Fenech in my mind as the Queen of the Giallo had she made a few more of these movies . I'm looking forward to checking out more of her work . As much as I enjoyed Death Walks on High Heels , it's not without its flaws . Chief among them , at least to me , is a " cheat " with respect to one of the murders . I don't want to give anything away , but there is one particularly nasty murder that the killer could not have committed given the circumstances immediately following the murder . Hopefully , with repeat viewings , I can reconcile this point in my mind and just enjoy the movie for what it is . Finally , and I'm really starting to sound like a shill , NoShame's new DVD is fantastic . I would have never dreamed that a movie like Death Walks on High Heels would look this good . Bravo NoShame !

Rossiter , through a series of ' accidents ' , makes sure they don't , thereby keeping his secret . Any more of the story would be too much . Circus of Horrors is a very visually pleasing film . The film's makers appear to have been heavily influenced by the Hammer movies being produced at the time . The lavish colors , costumes , and sets are very Hammer-like . And , like many of the Hammer movies , this one must have been quite shocking for its time . As an example , a knife throwing scene turns particularly nasty . The movie also features some wonderful acting . Anton Diffring is especially sinister as the mad doctor . Donald Pleasence , in a small role , highlights an above average supporting cast . The only problem I have with the movie is its tendency to lose focus . Too often , circus scenes seem to go on a little too long and drag the movie down to a snail's pace .
366240	3109237	51406	7.0	" I may sound like a lunatic , but I'm not crazy ! "	Gillian Holroyd ( Kim Novak ) is a witch . Secretly , she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson ( James Stewart ) . She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her . Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man . She decides to tell him her secret . But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was " tricked " into falling in love with Gillian ? As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go , Bell Book and Candle is good , but nothing spectacular . It's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it . Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread . The movie's cute , funny at times , and touching in the end . Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry . Novak ( as others have pointed out ) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way . The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon , Hermione Gingold , and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart . The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be . Is it a screwball comedy ? Is it a romantic comedy ? Is it a supernatural comedy ? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach , the movie might have been even better and more memorable .
366019	3109237	323630	7.0	Nice supernatural murder mystery	Shortly after popping Phone in the DVD player , my thoughts were , " Oh no . Not another Asian long-haired ghost story " . I thought it was going to be the same old thing . Since watching , I've read reviews on the internet that complain about the movie being " derivative " or " unoriginal " ( if you want to see derivative and unoriginal , check out Ju-rei ) . And while I agree to a certain extent , Phone has enough twists and turns in the plot to keep it from being just another " ghost with long hair " story . I see it as a murder mystery with supernatural elements . I'll admit that the mystery had me guessing up to the big reveal and the supernatural stuff had me jumping on more than one occasion . While it's certainly not the best Asian horror movie I've ever seen , I was reasonably entertained after a slow start . If the current crop of Asian horror has one thing in common , most all of the ones I've seen are technically brilliant . Phone is no exception . The house where most of the story takes place is visually stunning with a load of atmosphere ? a real feat in a modern setting . Sound , lighting , locations , special effects , etc . are all what I've come to expect when watching one of these movies . One area where Phone does not measure up to its Asian brethren is in the acting department . It's not that the performances are bad , but with one exception , no one really stands out . The performances are " workmanlike " at best . The exception is See-woo Eun who plays the little girl , Yeong-ju . And while most of her acting consists of a series of strange faces and growls at the camera , considering her apparent age , it's a solid and memorable performance . Given the subject matter and some of the things she was asked to do , I was impressed .
366359	3109237	83908	8.0	" You know how funny people can be about a spot of murder . "	I've lost count of the number of times I've seen Evil Under the Sun . The natural question may be " Why watch a mystery more than once when you already know whodunit ? " The simple answer ? entertainment . Evil Under the Sun never fails to provide me with almost two hours of entertainment . The movie is so much more than the mystery . Truth be known , Evil Under the Sun is one of the weakest of Agatha Christie's novels relying far too heavily on some absurd coincidences . So beyond the mystery , it's the location , the acting , and the character interactions that bring me back time and time again . - Location : The island scenery is simply breathtaking . The rocky cliffs set against the blue Mediterranean are beautiful . It's hard to believe that such places actually exist . The palace / hotel in which much of the film takes place is filmed in grand style . In short , Christopher Challis ' cinematography is stunning . - Acting : Evil Under the Sun features some wonderful actors having what appears to be a grand old time with their characters . Peter Unsitnov , James Mason , Diana Rigg , Roddy McDowell , and Jane Birkin are all truly wonderful in their performances . But for me , Maggie Smith makes Evil Under the Sun something special . Her catty Daphne Castle is a remarkably enjoyable character . - Character Interactions : Watching any of these fine actors working together is a real treat . But the best example of what makes Evil Under the Sun so much fun is watching Maggie Smith and Diana Rigg go at each other . One of my favorite moments has to be when Smith characters describes why Rigg's character went further as an actress than she did . She explains that not only could Rigg's character kick her legs higher , but also farther apart . It's a wonderfully funny moment .
366840	3109237	72354	8.0	Very Nice	- Over the past few months , I've watched three non-traditional vampire movies - Martin , Daughters of Darkness , and , now , Vampyres . These aren't your black-cape-wearing , fanged , turn-into-bats type of vampires . Instead , these vampires rely on luring an unsuspecting victim with their charms and , when the time is right , cutting them open to drink their blood . The vampires in Vampyres display a real viciousness when faced with blood . In all other respects , they appear to be quite normal . - Vampyres features some wonderful atmosphere . The old castle is a perfect setting for this kind of movie . Although we only see a couple of the rooms ( due more than likely to budget restraints ) , both are ideal for a vampire's lair . While some of the acting is less than perfect , it's never a distraction . The music is wonderful . The theme that plays over the titles is haunting and vicious at the same time . And , while there is a considerable amount of sex and nudity , it never feels out of place . After all , it's the preferred method in Vampyres to trap a victim . - There are one or two plot points that make little sense . One that really bothers me is near the beginning of the movie when a future victim is checking-in to the local inn . The innkeeper goes on and on about knowing him and how he had stayed there before . The man claims that the innkeeper is mistaken . What's that all about ? Why go through this scene of mistaken identity and never bring it up again ? What's the point ? Oh well , it's a small scene and easily overlooked .
366523	3109237	32324	8.0	" Only very foolish mouse makes nest in cat's ear . "	As the movie opens , Charlie Chan finds himself at the sentencing phase of trial he has given evidence in against a criminal named Steve McBirney . After McBirney is sentenced to be executed , he shoots his way out of the courthouse and makes his escape . He heads straight to a wax museum dedicated to figures depicting famous crimes and criminals . The museum is run by Dr . Cream . But Dr . Cream has another profession ? he's a plastic surgeon who specializes in making the faces of criminals unrecognizable . Dr . Cream also hosts a regular weekly radio show in his museum dedicated to crime . He invites Charlie Chan to be a guest on the next program . Reluctantly , Chan agrees to appear . But unfortunately for Chan , this week's radio program is a set-up for McBirney to get his revenge against the detective he blames for getting him convicted . If someone would have asked me twenty-five years ago what my favorite Charlie Chan film was , I would have most likely answered Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum . It's got a whole lot to like and a whole lot that appealed to me during my youth . Secret passages , a dark and stormy night , and creepy wax figures all add up to one of the more atmospheric movies in the Chan series . Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum probably comes as close as any of the other Chan films to having actual elements of horror ? something I always go for . As an added bonus , # 2 son Jimmy is less of an annoyance in this film and actually gives an interesting performance as he helps his Pop with the case . It's really not difficult to see why this movie appealed to me . It's just a fun movie ! Well , and unfortunately , my tastes seem to have changed over the past couple of decades . Thanks to the recent R1 DVD release , I was finally able to revisit Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum . And while my rating indicates I enjoyed the experience , it wasn't what I remembered . I could cite a number of problems I had with the film , but I'll just go into the most obvious . When it is discovered that someone was trying to use the wired-up chair to electrocute Chan , why doesn't Chan seem more interested in looking into this particular clue ? Other than being mentioned in passing a few times , the chair is almost forgotten . Shouldn't Chan have tried to discover more about the chair like who hooked it up to the wires or what Dr . Cream knew about it ? Instead , Chan spends his time running around in the dark ( both literally and figuratively ) trying to find a murderer . Sorry , but it doesn't add up .
366736	3109237	74586	8.0	One of the best films of this type I've seen	I have now seen quite a few of the Italian crime films made in the 70s . The Big Racket is easily among the better Poliziotteschi I've so far run across . The violent action is non-stop . The film rarely takes a break for the viewer to catch a breath . Fabio Testi stars as Inspector Nico Palmieri , a cop determined to put an end to the protection racket run by a group of local thugs . But the seemingly small time thugs are actually part of a larger group with the goal of spreading their reign of terror to a much larger scale . Nico enlists the aid of a handful of men who have been directly affected by the gang's activities to help him wipe out the entire group of gangsters . But does this small seemingly rag-tag band of misfits stand a chance against a much larger band of killers ? The Big Racket is gritty , violent , sadistic , and nothing is held back . Director Enzo Castellari has crafted some amazing action sequences . The shootouts at the train station and the final battle at the warehouse are some of the better scenes of this type I've seen . And the scene featuring Testi rolling down a hill inside a car is so well done and so realistic that I actually worried about Testi's health . The Big Racket also features a couple of rape scenes that can be difficult to watch , yet they add immensely to the overall feel of the film and supply realistic motivation for the vigilante actions to follow . These scenes are brutal and sadistic and show the depravity these thugs are capable of and why they must be eliminated . Fabio Testi gives one of his better performances that I've seen in The Big Racket . Unlike The Heroin Busters , where I never bought into Testi's character , he is completely believable in this film . The rest of the main supporting cast is just as good . My favorite supporting performance comes from Orso Maria Guerrini , the marksman who goes mad for vengeance after watching his wife get raped and burned alive . Much of the cast is made up of stunt people who do an adequate job given their limited experiences in front of the camera . Overall , if you're a Poliziotteschi fan or just a fan of American cop films from the 70s and have never seen an Italian crime film , The Big Racket is a definite must .
366158	3109237	29660	8.0	Comfortable and always welcome	When I arrived home from work today , I found the Mr . Moto Collection waiting on me . I decided to watch the movies in order and start with the first in the series , Think Fast , Mr . Moto . It's the story of a diamond smuggling ring operating aboard a luxury liner between China and the U . S . The mysterious and ever present Mr . Moto is on hand to put a stop to the illegal activity . Think Fast , Mr . Moto is the kind of movie that's best enjoyed curled up on the couch late at night when you want to put your brain on hold and just be entertained . It's like that favorite old , ratty shirt ? comfortable and always welcome . The plot in Think Fast , Mr . Moto may not make much sense ( even after everything has been explained ) but it's a lot fun . The film would hardly be as good without Peter Lorre in the title role . Unlike most everything I've see him in , Lorre gets the chance to be the hero here and is excellent in the role . The final cat and mouse game between Lorre and the always entertaining Sig Ruman is the highlight of the film ( although I must admit that it's difficult to watch Ruman and not want to laugh as images of the Marx Brothers pulling off his toupee went through my head ) . I can't wait to watch the other three films in the collection .
366795	3109237	29453	8.0	" Blame it on the Casbah . "	Pepe le Moko ( Jean Gabin ) is something of a celebrity in the Algerian Casbah he calls home . The locals do what they can to protect Pepe and keep the police off his trail in hopes of winning his favor . But how long can Pepe remain hidden in the maze-like Casbah ? The French police have a plan to use one of his best friends to lure Pepe out of the Casbah and place him under arrest . Complicating matters is a Parisian woman visiting Algiers that Pepe finds himself smitten with . She's different from what he's come to know in Algeria . She makes him dream and long for days of freedom outside the Casbah walls . To begin with , to anyone who recommended Pepe le Moko ? a big fat thanks . It's a great movie that I probably would have never even heard of had it not been for some of the good people at IMDb . As a budding fan of film noir , I was hooked from the minute the movie began . The plot kept my interest throughout . Never did it seem slow . I've only seen Jean Gabin in one other movie ( Touchez pas au grisbi ) , but I'm quickly discovering what a talented actor he was . His Pepe is a very believable character . He plays Pepe with style , feeling , and , when called for , viciousness . Director Julien Duvivier uses the twisted roads and alleyways of the Casbah to create a one of kind setting for his film . I've actually been in a place like this during a visit to Tangiers , and the Casbah in Pepe le Moko gave me that same feeling of a place you would easily get lost in . In many ways , Pepe le Moko is ahead of its time . First , I honestly had no idea that something so seemingly American as film noir could be traced to 1930s French cinema . Many of the American films of the next two decades can surely be traced to Pepe le Moko . Second , much of the subject matter in the film is certainly something an American movie of the 30s would never touch or discuss so openly . Themes of sex and adultery wouldn't be commonplace in American cinema for years to come . And finally , some of the film techniques used by Duvivier give the film the look of something made years later . The camera has a fluidity and style I don't associate with the 30s when so much of what was being made still relied on the old " plant and shoot " technique of the silent era .
366911	3109237	71275	8.0	Bava's grittier side	I have now seen all but a couple of Mario Bava's films . I've always enjoyed the way Bava seemed to reinvent himself with each movie . But Rabid Dogs represents even more of a departure from the norm for Bava . It's more akin to something Sam Peckinpah might have made than it is to such seemingly varied films as the Gothic nightmare of Black Sunday or the Technicolor dream of Hercules in the Haunted World or the campy fun of Danger Diabolik . Rabid Dogs is gritty and brutal and rarely lets up on the tension . The story involves three small-time robbers / killers who think that with their latest job they've hit the big time . During their escape , they pick up a frightened woman who will become the target of their abuse and an older man with a very sick child . Together , these six people will go on a nihilistic journey with only death waiting at the end . The confined set ( 90 % of Rabid Dogs takes place inside a car ) adds immensely to the psychological tension and physical threat these three desperate men represent . There is no place for the captives to go to escape the overbearing fear they face . Bava films this small space with some remarkable camera angels that build on the hot , claustrophobic feel of the movie . Gone are the colored gels and dream-like lighting Bava seemed so fond of in his earlier movies . Instead , Rabid Dogs is filmed in such a realistic manner that you can almost feel the sweat , grim , and dirt that comes from being trapped in such small space . Finally , even though I was able to predict the movie's outcome in some detail , it's quite shocking to watch as the final twist unfolds . If you're a Bava fan , Rabid Dogs may not be the kind of movie to which you're accustomed to seeing , but it's one that shouldn't be passed-up .
366170	3109237	31147	8.0	One of the best of the series	While in route to San Francisco , Chan's friend Paul Essex dies of an apparent suicide . The only clue is a threatening note from someone calling himself the Zodiac . Chan soon discovers that the Zodiac is a successful mystic . Together with a would-be psychic-buster and magician named Rhadini ( Cesar Romero ) , Chan sets out to discover the source of the Zodiac's mysticism and unmask a killer . I thought I had seen the best of the Charlie Chan series . Man , was I ever wrong . After a first viewing , Charlie Chan at Treasure Island has become one of my very favorite Chan films . It's not just one of Toler's best , it's one of the three or four best entries in the entire series . It's got everything a fan could ask for ? an interesting plot , a larger than life villain , solid acting , compelling characters , real suspense , comic relief that's actually funny , and some of the best writing I've seen in a Chan movie . The final reveal is also one of the best in the series . It's not the usual drawing room gathering of the suspects ( which I usually prefer ) , but a drawn out , tension filled scene in a theater full of people . And speaking of tension , Chan's first meeting with the Zodiac is amazing , if not a bit frightening . Charlie Chan at Treasure Island also benefits from a strong supporting cast . Cesar Romero , Douglas Fowley , Pauline Moore , and , personal favorite , Douglass Dumbrille add considerably to the film . Overall , this is one Charlie Chan film that I'm very much look forward to revisiting ? and soon .
366050	3109237	68611	8.0	" Bob's your uncle . "	I didn't realize that Frenzy was so divisive among Hitchcock fans . As with the last Hitchcock movie I watched , The Trouble with Harry , Frenzy seems to have more than its fair share of critics . The criticism of both movies seems to derive from a similar source ? Hitch deviated from what people expected . I'm not sure why people want to see the same movie over and over , but if you read the negative user comments on IMDb , you'll get that impression . What's wrong with shifting gears and making a comedy like The Trouble with Harry ? And what's wrong with turning up the violence and making a movie like Frenzy ? In each case , I appreciate what Hitchcock was trying to do and thoroughly enjoyed both movies . Frenzy is essentially a " Wrong Man " type movie that Hitch visited several times throughout his career . You know , an innocent man is accused of a crime and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the police trying to prove he's not guilty . In this case , Richard Blaney ( Jon Finch ) , a down on his luck and out of work bartender , is accused of violently raping a series of women before using his necktie to strangle them . Through some really bad luck , the case of circumstantial evidence against Blaney grows to the point that he becomes the only suspect . Tried and convicted , Blaney vows revenge against the man he knows to be guilty . I don't know that I would call Frenzy Hitchcock's best movie as some have , but it is a very entertaining thriller . It's an odd but satisfying mix of the most violent images ( the first rape and murder are difficult to watch ) and some of the darkest , funniest comedy ( the potato truck or the dinner scenes for example ) that Hitch ever made . Hitch proves his genius by masterfully balancing the two ? violence and comedy . And if you weren't already convinced of his reputation as a director , Hitchcock throws in a couple of very nice tracking shots , a clever use of sound , and a few other tricks that I won't begin to attempt to describe ( just watch the movie ) for good measure . Hitch also shows his genius through some of his casting choices . Other than Finch in the lead ( he's just not a very sympathetic figure to me ) , the rest of the actors are incredibly strong . Barry Foster gives one of the more memorable performances I've seen recently . He's just so creepy . In fact , all of the supporting players , from the prim Monica Barling played by Jean March to the hysterical Vivian Merchant as a would-be gourmet chef , are perfect . And when you add the nice location shots and an interesting , well written script ( have the words " you're my type of woman " ever been so menacing ) to the direction and acting , Frenzy becomes a very worthy and memorable entry in Hitchcock's filmography .
366700	3109237	69073	8.0	MMMMM - Edwige	- I've now seen this movie twice and I enjoyed it even more this time . It's a fairly standard , straightforward giallo ? a series of murders in an apartment building committed by a gloved , black-cloaked figure . There are no shortage of suspects and the police are unable to do much other than find stamps for their collection ( yes , that's right ? stamps ) . But there are three things that really make The Case of the Bloody Iris stand out to me : 1 . Cast ? Any giallo with both George Hilton and Edwige Fenech is going to be a winner as far as I'm concerned . Hell , anything with Edwige is a " must see " for me . 2 . Murder scenes ? Each murder scene is very well handled . There's even one that takes place on busy sidewalk that is so well done that it seemed plausible to me . 3 . The Score ? I think Bruno Nicolai's score is one of the best I've heard . I'm especially fond of the main title music . So much so that I've burned it to a CD ( with some music from 5 Dolls for an August Moon , Deep Red , and others ) and listen to all the time on my way to and from work . - The Case of the Bloody Iris is part of Anchor Bay's The Giallo Collection . While I enjoyed some more than others , none of the four movies was what I consider bad .
366437	3109237	66863	8.0	Criminally Underrated	Every great once in a while , you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations . Given the IMDb rating of 4 . 0 , I wasn't really expecting much with The Brotherhood of Satan . I hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like The Devil's Rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed Satanic horror films . I couldn't ' have been more wrong . What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast I really enjoyed . Speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away , the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s . The Brotherhood of Satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations . A lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks . As a viewer , you know something is amiss , but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is . The unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films . The ending is effective with its surreal imagery . I sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll . Those wanting a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed with the ending's simplicity . A lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would , most likely , have failed miserably . There are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director , Bernard McEveety , had primarily worked in television before The Brotherhood of Satan . There are a few scenes that are so well set-up , lit , and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two . For example , I've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors . Not here . The scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing . We see all five men at once ? each doing their own thing as in real life . In a lesser film , we might see all the men at once , but each would be motionless , quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue . It's a small scene , but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of The Brotherhood of Satan . Finally , I mentioned the acting in my opening , so without going into a long-winded speech , I'll just say that The Brotherhood of Satan features Strother Martin and L . Q . Jones . Any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me .
366018	3109237	51937	8.0	Another Mexican horror winner !	Another Mexican horror winner ! Until just recently , I doubt I could have named more than a half dozen Mexican horror films that didn't feature a masked wrestler . As I'm quickly discovering , Mexican horror has much more to offer ? especially for fans of Gothic horror . Films like The Black Pit of Dr . M appear to be heavily influenced by the classic Gothic Universal films of the 1930s . They have the same thick atmosphere , similar looking sets , a familiar grand but foreboding score , and common plot themes . In fact , if the actors weren't speaking Spanish and you could replace the main actor with Boris Karloff , you would essentially have a 1930s American horror film . The Black Pit of Dr . M is the story of a couple of doctors who have made what is in essence a death pact . The one who dies first will do whatever he can to comeback to let the another know what the afterlife is like . But Dr . Mazali isn't content with knowing what happens after death , he wants to experience it . His recently departed friend , Dr . Aldama , informs Dr . Mazali that it might be possible him to experience the afterlife , yet return to the living . But is Dr . Mazali willing to pay a heavy price to cheat death ? If I have one complaint with The Black Pit of Dr . M it would be with the predictable nature of some of the plot points toward the end of the movie . Maybe I've seen too many similar movies or maybe the movie really is predictable , but a few more plot twists in the films finale would have made this one even better . As it is , The Black Pit of Dr . M is a wonderfully entertaining movie even with this weakness . Fans of Gothic horror are sure to enjoy this one . Casa Negra's new DVD is amazing given the obscure nature of the movie . I sincerely doubt that The Black Pit of Dr . M ever looked better . The DVD includes a warning about some brassy moments in the film's soundtrack , and while I noticed it , the audio weaknesses never distracted or took away from the film's enjoyment . The extras are nice and include a very informative commentary with IVTV founder Frank Coleman . Overall , it's another solid job by Casa Negra .
366432	3109237	65148	9.0	My Favorite Fulci	Lucio Fulci may be best known for his zombie splatter-fests and that's a shame because he's really so much more than that . If you see the name Fulci and expect a gore-fest , you'll be disappointed . This one is even more bloodless than his other Gialli . But if you want a solid Italian thriller , you've discovered a real winner . I have no reservations about placing One on Top of the Other near the top of the list of the 60-odd Gialli I've seen . One on Top of the Other actually features very few , if any , horror elements . Instead , the movie focuses on two of the other Giallo trademarks ? sleaze and mystery . And Fulci does a fantastic job with both . As for the sleaze , there's probably more nudity and sex in this movie than in Fulci's A Lizard in a Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling combined . As for the mystery elements , Fulci fills the film with enough red herrings and other mystery tricks for two or three movies . I was completely engrossed and entertained form the opening credits . Solid cinematography , nice San Francisco locations , an outstanding Riz Ortolani score , above average acting , and Marisa Mell make One on Top of the Other a new favorite of mine . My only complaint ( and it is admittedly a small one ) is the amount of screen time showing the film's protagonist sitting on death row waiting to die . A little tighter editing during this 10 or so minute segment might have helped make One on Top of the Other the best Giallo I've ever seen . I mentioned Marisa Mell in the opening paragraph and if you're a fan , you owe it to yourself to track down a copy of One on Top of the Other . She never looked better and I've never seen so much of her . Her motorcycle striptease scene is worth the price of admission . Check it out ! Come on , Anchor Bay ? give us that Region 1 release !
366786	3109237	21884	9.0	" Crazy , am I ? We'll see whether I'm crazy or not . "	Revisiting Frankenstein is always a wonderful experience . I watch it today with the same enthusiasm and awe I did nearly 35 years ago . Everything about the film is so perfect . Acting , direction , cinematography , set design , plot , dialogue , special effects , etc . are top notch . And although each of these areas deserves to be discussed in detail ( and have in the volumes that have been written on Frankenstein ) , I'll focus on two areas that really standout to me ? Boris Karloff as the monster and James Whales direction . Is there a more iconic image in horror than Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster ? I sincerely doubt it . Even those who wouldn't be caught dead watching a horror film are familiar with that image . Beyond Jack Pierce's make-up , Karloff is amazing in the role . Even with the make-up , Karloff gives the monster life . We are able to see and feel the emotions the monster goes through . There is no better example than the scene with the monster and the little girl . As the monster stumbles out of the woods , there is a cautious look about him as his experiences with humans have thus far been less than satisfactory . But when the little girl accepts him and wants to play with him , the look of caution is transformed into a look of utter happiness . He smiles , he laughs , and he plays . But that emotion is replaced by one of confusion mixed with anger when he accidentally kills the girl . It's all there on Karloff wonderful face . It's this life that Karloff imbibes in the monster that makes Frankenstein a real classic . I've always thought that James Whale's direction was ahead of its time . In an era when directors were using what I call the " plant and shoot " method of filming , Whale made his camera a fluid part of the action . Whale takes the viewer beyond just watching moving images . He uses the camera to take the viewer into the scene . A small example is the way Whale filmed characters moving from one room to the next . The camera moves with the characters . Another example is the tracking shot Whale uses as the father carries his dead child into the town . As I said earlier , it has a fluidity in the way Whale filmed these scenes that makes it seem more natural . Finally , the way Whale introduces the monster is a highlight of the film . The monster backs into the room . As he turns , Whale shows the monster with three quick , ever tighter shots , ending with a close-up of the monster's face . Every Hollywood star of that era could have only wished for an introduction like that . While I have done nothing but praise Frankenstein , I'm not such a fan that I can't spot flaws in the film . The major issue with me has always been the way the scenes of action , horror , and violence are inter-cut with scenes of tranquility and bliss . I realize that was the way things were done in the 30s so people wouldn't , in essence , overload on horror , but it can make the film seem a little disjointed . But it's difficult to hold Whale overly responsible for this custom of the period .
366466	3109237	37008	9.0	I can't believe it took me 41 years to see this movie	- Considering all of the movies I've watched in my life , it's amazing I had never seen Laura . The film mixes an interesting story , excellent cinematography , solid acting , and characters you're not likely to forget to create a bona fide classic . I'm not an expert , but Laura is certainly one of the best examples of the film noir that I've thus far seen . Most every character in the movie has some tragic flaw . As for the story , I found the mystery of who killed Laura to be secondary to the interaction between the characters . They speak to each other in that wonderful way that only characters in a film noir speak . This is a definite must see that I look forward to revisiting time and time again . - While I previously praised the characters in Laura , they also represent the only real weakness I see in the film that keeps me from rating it a . The characters are a little too exaggerated . Det . Lt . Mark McPherson ( Dana Andrews ) is a little to solemn and non-feeling . The gold-digging , but penniless , playboy Shelby Carpenter ( Vincent Price ) is a little too conniving . And , although certainly one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen , Waldo Lydecker ( Clifton Webb ) is a little too flamboyant ( for lack of a better word ) . I don't know , but it's possible that these exaggerated characters were part of Preminger's plan . Regardless , the over-the-top characterizations can be a bit distracting .
366186	3109237	435625	9.0	" Hey , there's something down here . . . "	Sometimes I feel like I'm a couple of years behind everyone else . I had read the reviews from my online " friends " , but for whatever reason , I had a hard time believing what they were writing about The Descent . I thought there was no way it could be that good ! Well , they were right and I was wrong because The Descent is surely one of the best horror films this century has thus far produced . I've been watching horror for 35 or so years and it takes a lot to frighten me . I mention this not as a boast , but to put some credence behind my statement that The Descent is one of the scarier movies I've ever seen . It's frightening because it works on several different levels . There's the fear of closed spaces . There's the fear of the dark . There's the fear of the unfamiliar . And there is the fear of some unknown creature . Director Neil Marshall masterfully plays with each one of these types of fear . I was literally on the edge of my seat . In addition , most everything else about The Descent is first rate ? acting , special effects ( nice to see so much non-CGI on display ) , sound , editing , lighting , cinematography , etc . It's a very nice job indeed ! Another thing that Marshall did that I really like was he kept it " real " . What I mean is that everything worked within the framework of reality as the audience knows it ( well that is if you accept the notion of the underground creatures ) . The women were real and most of their reactions to the situations they found themselves in were real . The cave felt real even though it wasn't . The cave lighting was real and justified given the equipment the women were carrying . Even the albino mutants seemed to operate and function in a manner I would expect from such creatures . It's this realism that Marshall put into The Descent that goes a long way to making it as frightening as it is . As good as The Descent is and as much as I enjoyed the experience , it's not a perfect movie . There are a couple of areas where I thought Marshall should have done something differently . First , did there have to be a final showdown between two of the women ? I realize it was necessary for the subplot of Sarah taking control of her life , but did it have to be so clichéd ? Second , some of the foreshadowing all but slaps you in the face with its obviousness . Yeah , she left the map in her car ? do you have to beat me over the head with it ? I realize these are very minor quibbles and hardly take anything away from the movie . Finally , I can't wait to see what Neil Marshall comes up with next . He is truly one of the most promising directors working in horror today .
366307	3109237	58606	9.0	" This has gone well beyond the boundaries of prudence and good taste . "	Spider Baby is an almost perfect blend of black comedy and horror . The movie is just so bizarre that it must be seen to be believed . The basic story : Lon Chaney Jr . plays Bruno , the chauffeur and " caretaker " for the Merrye family . The Merrye's suffer from a rare disease that causes each member of the family to slowly degenerate mentally to the point of cannibalism . Chaney is in charge of the last three members of the inbred Merrye family and he understands what fate awaits them should the outside world discover their secret . When some distant relatives show up to take over the estate , madness ensues . Chaney is fantastic in the role of Bruno . IMO , this may be his best performance outside of his better known Wolf Man character . His comic timing is almost perfect , but he's equally adept a the dramatic moments . There is one very emotional scene when Chaney realizes what he must do that is so well played that I almost cried along with him . It's nice to see Chaney having so much fun with one of his final roles . It's also nice to see another of my favorites , Mantan Moreland , in one of final performances . Although it's a small part , his character is necessary to set up the madness to come . But the real ' stars ' of Spider Baby are the children . Beverly Washburn , Jill Banner , and Sid Haig are so incredibly bizarre and demented that I really can't say enough about how good and perfectly suited for their roles each is . Terrific performances by three young unknown actors . There are so many wonderful and freaky scenes that going through all of them would take pages of writing . One of my favorite scenes is the dinner scene . Some really great comedic moments mixed with repulsion over what's going on . I love Chaney's line during the dinner about the full moon . Who said that Scream was so original for being a self-referential horror movie ? There are only two negative things I can say about the movie . One is the performance of Karl Schanzer as Schlocker the lawyer . He just doesn't seem ' real ' . My second complaint is the amount of time given to the relatives living in the basement . I would have really enjoyed seeing more of them .
366582	3109237	31951	9.0	" One doesn't easily forget , Herr Baron , an arm torn out by the roots . "	When Baron Wolf von Frankenstein ( Basil Rathbone ) arrives to take over his father's estate , the locals immediately begin to fear for the worst . Wolf's father created a monster that terrorized the community and the townsfolk want no more of that . Wolf assures everyone that he has no intentions of creating a monster . But when Wolf finds Ygor ( Bela Lugosi ) living in the ruins of his father's laboratory , he is soon headed down the same path of destruction that claimed his father . Over the years , there have been volumes written on the Universal classic horror movies . Realizing that it would be foolish of me to attempt to improve or add much to the writings of these scholars , I'll instead focus on a couple of areas that make Son of Frankenstein so special to me . 1 . The Acting . Son of Frankenstein features a Who's Who of the best of the classic horror actors . Joining Rathbone and Lugosi in the cast are Boris Karloff and Lionel Atwill . While each gives a noteworthy performance in their own right , Lugosi's performance is generally held up as the best of his career . And while I agree , Rathbone makes Son of Frankenstein a joy for me to watch . There are very few actors that I can think of who could have played Wolf with the same type of intelligent energy that Rathbone exhibits . He's wonderful . As for Karloff , I'm glad he decided to make Son of Frankenstein his last as the monster . By the time of the second sequel , Karloff's monster became little more that a prop for Lugosi , Rathbone , and Atwill to fight over . 2 . The Sets . I'm not exaggerating when I say that the sets in Son of Frankenstein are among the best I've ever seen . The sets are amazing with their bizarre angles and shadows . Two that immediately come to mind are the dining table set and the staircase set at the beginning of the movie . They are in a class of their own . Every fan of horror , or just good classic movies in general , owes it to themselves to see Son of Frankenstein . It may not be as well known among the casual fan as either Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein , but it many ways it's the equal of those two films ( if not better ) .
366361	3109237	74937	9.0	" Room filled with empty people . "	There are three movies that , for whatever reason , I have watched literally 100s of times . Murder By Death is one of the three movies . The great thing is that I never get tired of it . It never gets old with me . The comedy is as fresh today as it was in 1976 when I saw Murder By Death in the theater . I think the movie appeals to me because I grew up reading Agatha Christie and watching Charlie Chan on The Late Show . Later , when I discovered the Humphrey Bogart movies and the Thin Man movies , I became an instant fan . I get a real kick out watching Neil Simon poke fun at the characters from these books and movies . The screenplay is clever , intelligent , and , most importantly , funny . I all but laugh out loud every time I watch the " dead , naked butler " bit or listen to Peter Selles arguing with the " cow " on the wall . It's good stuff ! In addition to Simon's writing , the acting in Murder By Death is a real highlight . The cast is a Who's Who of some of the best actors of the 60s and 70s . David Niven , Peter Sellers , Alec Guinness , Peter Falk , and every other member of the cast ( including the usually annoying James Coco ) are all wonderful . Their parodies of the famous detectives are dead-on perfect . But the best , in my opinion , is Maggie Smith . It's amazing that in a group of such renowned actors , Smith is able to steal almost every scene and become the center of attention . She is simply amazing in Murder By Death . I could watch her all day . So , here's to another 100 viewings of Murder By Death ! I can't get enough of it .
366813	3109237	1143231	9.0	Nothing says " Merry Christmas " like the rat-chewed body of Santa Claus !	What an excellent way to kick-off the Holiday Season ! The wife and I have been making our way through the first three seasons of Bones and so far , " The Santa in the Slush " just might be one of my favorite episodes . In this one , Booth and Brennan are called in to investigate the death of a man they later identify as Kris Kringle . In full Santa regalia , Kringle is found dead , his body decomposing , lying in a sewer . Nothing says " Merry Christmas " like the rat-chewed body of Santa Claus ! There are other episodes of Bones that are more realistic , that take their subject matter more seriously , and that toy more with the emotions of the viewer ? but there are few that are this much fun . A lot of the usual drama is pushed to the side in favor of a more comedic tone ? and with excellent results . Don't misunderstand , I realize there is a touch of comedy in almost every episode , but here it takes center stage . And just the notion of a temp agency specializing in Santas and Elves is hysterical . The interplay between Bones and Booth was never better . The subplots dealing with Bones ' attempt to give her father his dream Christmas in jail and Booth's desire to spend the Holiday with his son add just the right touch of humanity without ever becoming schmaltzy . Altogether , this is one fine episode of a wonderful show . A seems right to me .
366641	3109237	78935	9.0	" Today people want sensationalism ; the more you rape their senses the happier they are . "	Going into a film like Cannibal Holocaust , it's difficult to know what to expect . Anyone who has any interest has read all the hype ? the most disturbing movie ever made , banned in 60 countries , real animal killings , director Ruggero Deodato had to go to court to prove the human killings weren't real , etc . What I didn't expect to discover was such a well-made film . Parts of the film are indeed very brutal and , at times , difficult to watch . There are images in the film that I won't soon forget . The story is incredibly compelling because it is so real . Tribes of Indians similar to the ones presented in this film did ( and in some cases do ) exist in the South American rain forests . I suppose that if someone were looking for a " deep " meaning to Deodato's film , they might point to the man vs . nature aspects of the film where nature is represented not just by the animals , but by the natives as well . I suppose one could find something in the notion of who the real savages are ? the natives or the filmmakers who exploit them . But the most amazing thing about Cannibal Holocaust is that somehow Deodato has made it very beautiful .
365956	3109237	23245	9.0	" He went for a little walk ! "	- Throughout the great length of his career , Boris Karloff played a number of horror cinema's most memorable characters . But I've always been of the opinion that his work in Universal's The Mummy is his best . - The story in The Mummy is , in many respects , almost identical to Universal's earlier Dracula movie . Exchange a mummy for a vampire and Cairo for Transylvania and the rest is quite comparable . Both movies are basically love stories - regardless of how twisted the " love " may seem . Ardath Bay's sole purpose in life ( or should that be afterlife ) is to resurrect the spirit of his long dead love , Princess Anckesen-Amon . His 3 , 000 year obsession and devotion is demonstrated in the line , " Anckesen-Amon , my love has lasted longer than the temple of our gods . No man ever suffered as I did for you . " The response he receives a few scenes later , " No . No , I'm alive . I'm young . I won't die . I loved you once , but now you belong with the dead . I am Anckesen-Amon , but I'm somebody else too . I want to live , even in this strange new world " , is heartbreaking . - Other obvious and less obvious examples of how the two movies are similar include : the use of religious symbols to repel the monsters , the use of hypnosis , the close-up shots of the eyes , and cast members who play basically the same roles ( Edward Van Sloan and David Manners appear in both films in almost identical roles ) . Finally , a similarity that I've always noticed that I've not read anywhere else concerns the Renfield character from Dracula and poor Ralph Norton in The Mummy . Both become stark-raving , hysterical-laughing , mad lunatics . And whether intentional or not , both assist their respective monsters with their plans ? Renfield by actively helping Dracula and Norton by accidentally bringing the mummy back to life . - Karloff is perfect as Imhotep / Ardath Bay . I've said a number of times that Karloff was born to play this role . His slim , long body looks like what I imagine a mummy might look like after 3 , 000 years in the hot , drying desert . Karloff's face , with the help of Jack Pierce's make-up , looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch . And , as most would agree , Karloff's voice has an otherworldly quality that sounds as if it were coming from the grave . Karloff's acting abilities also add to the illusion that he is the mummy . Whether his decision or that of director Karl Freund I don't know , but Karloff gives a very understated performance that is necessary if he is to be believed . The understated performance without wild , exaggerated movements is perfect for a 3 , 000 year old mummy . His carriage suggests a very fragile being that fears crumbling with any strenuous action . To me , Karloff simply is The Mummy . - Every time I watch The Mummy , I'm amazed at how little screen time Karloff has as Imhotep . To think that he spent 8 hours a day getting the full-body mummy treatment only to appear for a few minutes in the final film ( and never a full body shot ) shows an amazing amount of restraint on the part of Freund . If you're a believer in the " what's not shown is more frightening that what is " theory of horror , you'll appreciate Freund's decision . But the few shots where Imhotep does appear are , for me , the definition of movie magic . I'll never forget the first time I saw The Mummy . The scene where Imhotep slowly opens his eye to reveal for the first time that he is alive immediately became ( and remains ) for me one of the most memorable moments in horror history .
366207	3109237	36376	9.0	" D - r - a - c . . . "	Even though I consider myself a classic horror fan ( and a fan of the classic Universal horror movies in particular ) , I readily admit that Dracula ( 1931 ) is not among my favorites . In fact , I prefer almost all of the Dracula sequels to the original . And , I consider Son of Dracula the best of the bunch . Why ? I'm prepared to write about three areas in Son of Dracula that work almost perfectly for me : the atmosphere , the mix of genres / styles , and the cast . - Atmosphere ? Son of Dracula positively drips with atmosphere . The misty swamps , the expertly lit interiors , the luscious sets , the eerie music , and Robert Siodmak's direction all contribute to the richness and underlying sense of taboo and dread . One scene that perfectly demonstrates the film's atmosphere is the rise of Dracula from the swamps . The coffin rises from the swamp floor , a vaporous mist comes forth eventually changing into Dracula's solid form , he glides effortlessly across the swamp to meet his mortal love and future wife ? man , you could bath in the atmosphere . - Mix of genres / styles ? Throughout its history , horror has often been combined with other genres or styles of movies . Most obvious are the great number of horror / comedies or horror / sci-fi films you can find . Sometimes , horror is mixed in more unusual ways . For example , there are horror / Westerns and even horror / romance films . Son of Dracula is one of the very few movies that I would call a horror / film noir ( I know that film noir isn't necessarily a genre , but humor me here ) . All the film noir trappings are here . To begin with , Son of Dracula has that look generally associated with film noir . Just take a look at the use of shadows and you'll see what I mean . But a better example is Kay Caldwell as the femme fatal and Dracula , of all people , as her dupe . The way Kay uses Dracula to do what she wants would have made even Phyllis Dietrichson proud . Kay uses Dracula to kill her father so she can get the estate and then tricks him into marriage to gain immortality . Finished with Dracula , he becomes disposable . She turns to old flame Frank Stanley to help her destroy Dracula . In the end , all three ? Kay , Dracula , and Frank ? are either dead or damaged beyond repair . Take away the supernatural elements of the story and you've got a typical 1940s film noir . - The cast ? A lot of people tend to focus on Lon Chaney , Jr . , suitability for the role of Dracula . The criticism is almost always related to Chaney's physical appearance . I'm convinced that some of these people can't get past his size long enough to take a look at his performance . And I've always thought of it as a rock solid performance . Equally mysterious is Louise Allbritton in role of the manipulative Kay . She's fantastic as she winds both Dracula and Frank around her finger . As for Robert Paige as the doomed Frank , he's perfect . He plays the tragic figure so well . Beyond these three , the film also features solid supporting performances from Evelyn Ankers , J . Edward Bromberg , and Frank Craven . All are terrific . Everyone involved in the cast really comes out of Son of Dracula looking good . In the end , I do not hesitate to rate Son of Dracula a . Other than some minor quibbles I have with how quickly Dr . Brewster comes to believe in and accept that Dracula is in their presence , the film is near flawless to me . And it gets better with each successive viewing . Watching tonight , I realized I was enjoying it even more now than ever before . It's a great movie !
366848	3109237	76786	10.0	Argento's Masterpiece	- From IMDb : " A young American dancer travels to Europe to join a famous ballet school . As she arrives , the camera turns to another young woman , who appears to be fleeing from the school . She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature . Meanwhile , the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school , but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences . She eventually discovers that the school is merely a front for a much more sinister organization . " - From the moment Suzy ( Jessica Harper ) steps out of the airport at the beginning of the movie , the power of Suspiria is evident . Suspiria is like a Technicolor nightmare . No matter how many times I've seen this movie , I never get tired of it . In fact , I seem to enjoy it more with each subsequent viewing . Very few films have a combination of visuals ( each frame of film is like a painting ) , soundtrack ( few films have a soundtrack that so perfectly compliments the action on screen ) , and story ( I've always found the story to be one of the most compelling aspects ) like Suspiria . In my opinion , this is very nearly the perfect movie . - It is very difficult to make a horror movie that actually frightens . Suspiria has moments that are to me as frightening as any I've seen . The scene that immediately pops to mind is the bathroom scene near the beginning of the movie . The girl in the bathroom hears a noise and looks out the window to investigate . As a viewer , I just knew something was going to happen . The situation and music are a clear indication that this girl is in trouble . But Argento is very patient and allows the tension to build . When nothing immediately happens , you're sure that Argento had been playing a trick on you . All of a sudden - BAM - you see two eyes staring back into the bathroom . I jump out of my seat every time I see that scene . It's really filmed very masterfully . - One complaint I've read on numerous websites concerns the acting . I tend to think a lot of people are confusing bad acting with the whole dubbing process used by Argento and other Italian directors . Suspiria was originally filmed in English with no sound actually recorded . All of the dialogue was added in post production . Why ? Often , these Italian films featured actors who spoke a variety of languages - not necessarily English . During filming , these actors would do their best to phonetically sound out the dialogue . Another persons voice was then often added and matched as good as possible to the lip movements . The lip movements and dialogue are often out of sync and I think some people have a hard time getting past this .
366426	3109237	837340	10.0	One of the coolest Jonny Quest episodes	The Quests pay a visit to Dr . Ashida , an old friend of Dr . Benton Quest's . Dr . Ashida has been doing research with the Tobura lizard . As a result of his research , he has been able to grow the lizards into 14 ' man-eating dragons . And if Dr . Ashida and his dragons weren't enough , the Quest Team will have to deal with a mountain of a man known as Sumi . Thinking back to my childhood , there are three episodes of Jonny Quest that really standout . The Robot Spy , The House of Seven Gargoyles , and this one , The Dragons of Ashida , are a big part of the reason that Jonny Quest has such a special place in my memories . It's just so cool ! The Dragons of Ashida has a lot going for it . Dr . Ashida is a madman of the first order . He's quite capable of doing anything ( which results in his ultimate downfall ) . And the way he's drawn ? he even looks evil . The dragons themselves scared me at one time . Today I look at them and marvel at their detail , especially in the final chase scene . Last , there's Sumi . Just he sight of an overpowering , one-eyed , bald Sumo wrestler was ( and still is ) amazing . With danger around every corner , two of the most vicious baddies the Quests ever faced , and the threat of ending up dragon food makes The Dragons of Ashida a winner .
366334	3109237	57730	10.0	My favorite cartoon	Back in the 60s , I was convinced that " Jonny Quest " was the single greatest cartoon ever created . It was something special . It had a more adult feel to it and , therefore , to my 5 year old mind , that made it more real . Watching today , I realize how wrong my notions of reality were , but there's no denying a more serious tone or style to " Jonny Quest " than any other cartoon on at the time . But there's also no denying how good it really was . I was incredibly envious of Jonny and the adventures he and Hadji were allowed to go on . Battling mummies , chasing a giant robotic spider , and fighting off giant condors were just part of the fun . And what about Race Bannon ? what small boy worth his salt didn't want to grow up and be like Race ? He was awesome . Finally , I would argue that there were other positive aspects of the show beyond entertainment . This may sound completely ridiculous to someone who never watched " Jonny Quest " , but it inspired a real interest in science and history in me and my brother . I look at the show as having had a very positive influence on us . I have fond memories of many of the episodes , but if I had to pick just one as a favorite , I think I would go with " The House of the Seven Gargoyles " . Talk about creeping me out ? I hid my head under the covers . I still have the most vivid memories of that episode . I recently picked up the DVD set and , over the past couple of months , I've been making my way through the episodes . Forty years later , I'm still enjoying them and " The House of Seven Gargoyles " is still pretty creepy . To my delight , my four year old son has watched a couple of the episodes with me . I was thrilled when I realized how much he was loving it . Like father , like son ? how cool is that ?
366249	3109237	26663	10.0	" I have conquered science ! Why can't I conquer love ? "	Renowned surgeon Dr . Gogol ( Peter Lorre ) is madly obsessed with an actress named Yvonne Orlac . The feeling , however , is not mutual as Yvonne is married to a pianist named Stephen . When Stephen's gifted and talented hands are crushed in a train wreck , Yvonne begrudgingly seeks Gogol's assistance to save her husband's career . Seeing an opportunity to get in Yvonne's good graces , he agrees to help Stephen . Gogol replaces Stephen's mangled hands with those of a knife throwing murderer only recently put to death . But Gogol's plans for Yvonne backfire when Stephen's new hands prove to have a mind of their own . Overlooked for far too long ( probably because it wasn't part of the Universal packages that so many television stations bought and aired ) , it's good to finally see Mad Love getting so much richly deserved praise . It's a classic in every sense of the word . There are so many facets to the movie I could write about , but , in the name of brevity , I'll try to control myself and limit my comments to two items . The first is the film's look . Technically , Mad Love is nothing short of brilliant . Director Karl Freund was first and foremost a cinematographer ? as Mad Love proves . Freund knew how to shoot a scene . As an example , take a look at the scenes set in the hallway and stairwell of Dr . Gogol's house . They may be insignificant to the overall movie , but you can see the care and effort Freund put into those moments . These scenes are like a painting come to life with their stunningly beautiful mix of light and shadows . Or , take the better known shots of Gogol dressed as the dead knife thrower . Not only are the special effects some of the most frightening of the 30s , the lighting in that scene goes a long way to creating the desired effect . It's an amazing piece of work . Peter Lorre's performance is the other aspect of Mad Love that jumps out at me . Lorre has always been a favorite of mine , but I consider his work in Mad Love the best he ever did . Lorre does more without words in this movie than most actors would be capable of . For example , Gogol's repressed longing for Yvonne is clearly evident on Lorre's face without him even having to utter a word . Or , take the scenes in the operating room . The slow building madness in Lorre's eyes as the surgery progresses is clearly evident . And once again , Lorre doesn't have to utter a word . I consider Lorre's performance in Mad Love to be one of the best in the annals of horror . Brilliant ! And I don't know who came up with the idea of the shaved head to go along with Lorre's bulging eyes , but it was a winner . It only serves to highlight Lorre's already expressive features . As I indicated previously , if I allowed myself I could write for days on Mad Love . But I won't . I suppose I could end this by mentioning what has to be the most common criticism of Mad Love that I've read ? the comic relief . But why let something that insignificant ruin what is otherwise a perfect movie ?
