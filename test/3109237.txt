366561	3109237	113135	1.0	" I have a job too ; I'm a tool . "	I've just about reached my limit . I've watched more than my share of bad movies in the past few months . Sure , as is the case with Future War , I've watched many of these movies courtesy of and with the assistance of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - but I've watched them just the same . Future War may be the last for a while . It's so bad I'm ready to swear off bad movies all together . The plot is a completely ridiculous mish-mash of incomprehensible ideas that never made a lick of sense to me . Something about a traveler from the future with cyborgs and their dinosaur " trackers " hot on his heels . The only person he's got to turn to for help is a former druggy / prostitute turned nun facing a crisis of faith . Like I said , none of it makes sense . I've said this so many times that I'm starting to sound like a broken record , but Future War is bad in every way a movie can be bad . The acting is beyond pitiful . Neither of the movies ' two leads , Daniel Bernhardt or Travis Brooke Stewart , seem capable of acting their way onto a community theater stage , let alone a sound-stage . Most surprising to me is that Bernhardt went on to have a fairly successful career , because in Future War , he comes across as nothing more than a Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe without any of Van Damme's talent . ( Did I just insinuate that Van Damme has talent ? ) Beyond the acting , the special effects are of particular note . The dinosaurs are about the most Gawd awful things I've seen in a movie . I could film something about as realistic with the plastic dinosaurs my son has in his room . Wait a minute - I think that might be what they used ! Finally ( and believe me , I could go on forever ) , the editing in Future War is atrocious . Some scenes are edited so poorly that it's all but impossible to follow the action . Overall , Future War is about as bad as a movie can get . I can't really come up with an inspired description , so I'll end this by saying , " It sux ! "
366770	3109237	118137	1.0	" Wuur-wilf ? You mean Joel thinks this thing is a wuur-wilf ? "	When I write one of these little reviews , there are certain words I try to avoid when describing a movie . Some words just don't seem appropriate . But when it comes to Werewolf , I'm going to break this rule . Werewolf has to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen . While watching Werewolf , it's difficult to fathom that an upright walking human with opposable thumbs and an I . Q . above that of a water sprinkler could have made something so inept . Werewolf's plot is an absolute unadulterated mess . You could give cameras to a band of poo throwing monkeys and end up with a more coherent movie . The actors are given some of the most inane dialogue ever recorded . And it doesn't help matters that three of the main characters ( Adrianna Miles being the worst offender ) sound more like they need to be in an ESL class than shooting a movie . If Joe Estevez emoting like there's no tomorrow is the highlight of the movie , you know you're in deep trouble . In short , Werewolf is a disaster . But , as bad as Werewolf admittedly is , coming up with a rating has proved more difficult that I imagined . Much of the movie is so unintentionally hilarious that I was entertained despite the multitude of problems . Take the film's continuity ( or lack thereof ) as an example . Watching actor Jorge Rivero's hair go from almost black and slicked back to slightly graying with less of a greasy look to brown with blond highlights and a feathered appearance all in a matter of 15 minutes is too funny . Or take the scenes where the werewolf transforms from an actor in makeup to a stuffed animal being shaken at the camera to someone in a bear suit all within 45 seconds ? it's laugh-out-loud , hold your sides so they don't split hysterical . But in the end , it's still a pathetic movie and a rating of seems somehow generous .
366547	3109237	165758	1.0	Where in the World is Cameron Mitchell ?	What was that ? I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time , but Enforcer from Death Row ranks right up there with the absolute worst . I wasn't expecting the second coming of Citizen Kane or anything , but come on - this thing is barely watchable . I would have probably never rented Enforcer from Death Row but for two things . First , the plot description I read on the Netflix website intrigued me . " T . L . Young ( Leo Fong ) sits imprisoned on death row , awaiting his date with the electric chair . But he's given a second chance when he's rescued by members of an international peacekeeping organization . In exchange for his life , however , Young is sent on a risky mission to stop a deadly group of criminals . This movie is jam-packed with action scenes featuring lethal ninjas , brutal tortures and thrilling car chases . " Sounds kinda cool . Unfortunately , the people responsible for this abomination had no concept of how to make a movie . I could cite any number of atrocious problems with Enforcer from Death Row ( like the bad acting or the weak special effects or the 75-watt bulb used to light the sets or the three Bunsen burners and test tube racks that made up the bacterial weapons lab or the laughable dubbing choices or the " thrilling " low-speed helicopter rescue or . . . ) , but I'll focus on the complete lack of continuity found in the movie . The most offensive example is a scene where a guy jumps off the roof of a building and miraculously lands in the ocean . And I don't mean right at the water's edge - he landed way out in at least 4 or more feet of water . How'd he do that ? Moments later , he's on a road stopping a passing car . The overhead shot shows the car , the road , and some vividly green farmland . What happened to the ocean ? What happened to the building ? Was there something in the movie about teleportation I missed ? It's just jaw-dropping ridiculous . The second reason I took a chance on Enforcer from Death Row was Cameron Mitchell . As a rule , I'll watch anything with Cameron Mitchell at least once . Even when the movie's bad , he's usually entertaining . I had read from another review that Mitchell's time was limited to a couple of minutes at the most . Well , not in my version of movie . I sat for almost an hour and a half and no Cameron Mitchell . What the . . . ? How can you put Mitchell's name in the credits and not deliver ? What a rip ! My best advice is to stay as far away from this turkey as you can . Even if you find a copy that includes Cameron Mitchell , it's still not worth it .
366639	3109237	80646	1.0	Inept is the word that comes to mind	Based on a lot of what I've read about Don't Go in the House , it seems to be a Love It or Hate It kind of movie . There appears to be very little middle ground . Put me in the Hate It category . If you take a look at some of the other stuff I've reviewed and enjoyed , you'll notice I do not automatically write-off a movie because of a low budget . Some of my favorites fall into the low-to-no budget category . But what those movies have that is sorely lacking in Don't Go in the House is talent . This is one of the most inept pieces of celluloid I've watched . It comes off as some kind of lame Psycho rip-off without anything approaching entertainment to be found in the entire runtime . It's dull , poorly acting , poorly directed , and poorly scripted . I feel like I've just flushed the $11 . 98 I paid for the DVD down the commode .
366021	3109237	377707	1.0	I wasn't prepared for what I've just seen .	WARNING ? Watching Crocodile could prove hazardous to your physical , mental , and emotional health . Having just finished watching Crocodile , I'm almost dumbfounded by the ineptitude I've witnessed . I had been warned by a couple of trusted friends that the movie was bad , but nothing could prepare for what I've just seen . To call Crocodile bad would be an understatement an an insult to other bad movies . It's one of the worst examples of movie-making I've ever seen . The plot , as best I could discern , involves a man whose entire family is killed by a giant crocodile . The man vows revenge . Sound familiar ? While even the worst of the other " Man vs . Nature " movies I've seen handle this scenario with a little class , originality , or a minimum of technical skill , Crocodile is pathetic in comparison . Acting ? as bad as I've seen . Music ? never appropriate to the image . Editing ? sloppy is too nice a word . Special effects ? what's that ? Plot ? see Jaws . Cinematography ? a monkey could have framed the shots better . Crocodile excels in poorly constructed miniatures , random shots of people and objects that have no bearing on the plot , and an overall incoherence that makes the movies Ed Wood and Al Adamson seem like masterpieces . Consider yourself warned . .
366604	3109237	100273	1.0	Someone should have fed this movie to the shark	This is one really bad movie . I've racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make . The acting is atrocious . I've seen more believable performances on cable access . The plot is ridiculous . Stolen diamonds , secret recordings of the President , and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst . Night of the Sharks isn't even so bad it's good . The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed . And to top it off , Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard . I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record . From everything I've read , the Italian film industry was dead by 1987 . Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin .
366574	3109237	55612	1.0	So wretched that I felt like retching	A junkyard owner is approached by two hoods to help them with an armored car heist they have planned . Although hesitant at first , he agrees after meeting and falling for a stripper trying to break into acting . He wants the money to help her get away from the seedier side of Hollywood . The robbery goes off as planned , but the would-be criminals turn on each other with disastrous consequences . I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years , but only a handful fall into the I-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out category . Hollywood After Dark is one such movie . It's bottom of the barrel in every respect . The acting is horrendous ; the plot is a disaster ; the direction is Coleman Francis-ish ; the stripper scenes are mind-numbingly awful ; and on it goes . Hollywood After Dark is a tawdry , dirty , and depressing mess of a movie . I wasn't sure when the movie ended if I should take a shower or slit my wrists . It's that bad ! And if the movie wasn't already wretched enough , just wait until Rue McClanahan takes the stage for her burlesque number . That's right ? Golden Girl Rue McClanahan is a stripper ! It's one of those moments that I could have gone all my life without seeing . Now that I've got that visual back in my head , add retching to my list of things I thought about doing after watching the movie !
365994	3109237	86486	1.0	As bad as a movie can get	I don't know that it's really fair for me to write anything on Oasis of the Zombies as I've never actually seen the entire film . I've tried to watch it at least four different times , but , I can't seem to get through it to the end . Why ? Oasis of the Zombies is such a complete and utter mess that I either shut it off about half way through because I just can't take it anymore or I end up falling asleep out of total boredom . Even by Jess Franco standards , Oasis of the Zombies makes no sense plot-wise and it's as dull as dishwater . The acting is atrocious . The special effects are so bad they go beyond being laughable . Oasis of the Zombies has to be one of the worst excuses for a movie I've ever had the misfortune of attempting to watch . Maybe I'll give it another go at some point in the future , but I rather doubt it . I don't want to come across as one of those people who dismisses Franco as a no talent hack . That's just not true . There are some Franco films I really enjoy ( Venus in Furs , The Diabolical Dr . Z , and Night of the Skull to name just a few ) , so it's not like I don't " get " Franco . I just can't imagine even the most vocal and ardent of Franco supporters enjoying this trash .
366453	3109237	28174	2.0	Painfully BA	Revolt of the Zombies is BAD . There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie . It is dull , lifeless , poorly acted , and poorly scripted . I've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste , well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride . The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes . The story : An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through " zombification " . One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him . Once this happens , he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences . That's it . That's the whole story . For most of the movie , I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead . He looked so familiar . I had plenty of time to think this over . Nothing was happening in the movie . Just before the " zombies revolted " , it hit me . It was Dean Jagger . I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas . This is how I " entertained " myself throughout most of the movie . I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie . King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie . For what it's worth , I'll give it a . ( I won't go to because , believe it or not , I've seen worse . )
366842	3109237	52609	2.0	I don't mind a slow film but this is just plain dull	- After stealing a load of gold , three gangsters ( and a girl ) hire the local ski instructor to take them on a cross country ski trip . They plan to meet a plane that's to take them to Canada , but they don't plan on the blizzard that makes that impossible . Oh , and there's some sort of monster on the loose . - Beast from the Haunted Cave is as dull as dishwater . It's padded with some of the most mind-numbing conversations imaginable . These people will talk about anything and everything if it means extending the running time . Other than the 10 foot long arms , the monster reminded me of It from the Addams Family . Better than many of the 50s monsters , but not much better . The music is all over the place and often doesn't fit well with the action on screen . A pre-title sequence has a snappy jazz score that could be mistaken for something out of a Jess Franco film . That's immediately followed by a very serious pipe organ that could easily be mistaken for music from Carnival of Souls . Other than Sheila Carol , the acting is abysmal . - The silliest moment ( and there are several ) occurs after the cross country trip when the group arrives at the ski instructor's cabin . It takes at least two days to get there , so it's definitely isolated . What do the gangsters find when they arrive ? A housekeeper ! Hazel would have been proud of this woman's dedication .
366160	3109237	61014	2.0	I love Bava , but this movie is almost unwatchable	Mario Bava is responsible for some of my all-time favorite movies . Black Sunday , Kill Baby ? Kill , Danger : Diabolik , Black Sabbath , and Blood and Black Lace are all in my top 100 . I guess you could call me a Bava fanboy . As far as I'm concerned , Mario Bava was a genius and one of the greatest directors ever . I even love the movie that Bava considered his worst ? Five Dolls for an August Moon . However , if he thought of Five Dolls for an August Moon as his worst then ( as I wrote in my comment for that movie ) " I guess Bava never had the misfortune of watching his movie Dr . Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs " . I take it that there are some difference between the Italian version and the American version , but I doubt they'd change my opinion much . Dr . Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs is just that ? a complete and utter BOMB of a movie . Other than Vincent Price's gleeful performance as Dr . Goldfoot , I can't think of another positive thing to mention . The plot is ridiculous . The acting is abysmal . The comedy , especially on the part of the two Italian buffoons Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia ( maybe it's a cultural thing ) , isn't funny at all . The music is terrible . The final chase scene is noteworthy for being just so incredibly stupid . And there are none of the Bava directorial trademarks or flourishes that I've come enjoy . And to top it all off , the dubbing is simply atrocious . I normally don't complain too much about dubbing , but in this case the whole movie has a hollow , staged sound to it . In the end , Dr . Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs is so bad that it makes Dr . Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine ( the first of the two Goldfoot movies ) look like a masterpiece of cinema ( which it most definitely isn't ) . As much as I hate to do it , I've got to give this Mario Bava film a .
366243	3109237	97174	2.0	None of it is in the least bit interesting	There's really no need to go into plot details ? with a movie this bad they hardly matter . Suffice it to say that what plot there is involves three ( at least I think it was three ? but it might have been two ? not that anyone should give a rat's patooty ) stones that , when put together , give the holder some sort of power ( at least I think that's the point of the stones ) . Yada , yada , yada ? who cares ? None of it is in the least bit interesting anyway . I don't think you could make something as bad as Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell even if you tried . It's horrible in every conceivable way ? bad acting , poor direction , nonsensical plot , lame special effects , and everything else you can think of . In all honesty , I cannot think of many movies that I would call worse than this pile of garbage . So , you may ask , " if it's so bad , why not rate it a ? " My answer ? while it's as bad a movie as you'll run across , Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell features a few moments of complete unintentional humor that did bring something resembling a smile to my face . I realize that giving the movie a point based on a couple of ridiculous moments might not be the best way to rate a movie , but it's not like I gave it a . is still bad ! I actually watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the movie . While I enjoy ( ed ) MST3K , I'm one of those who sincerely believe that the movies featured on the show should be judged on their own merits . You shouldn't assume that just because a movie was lampooned on television that it's a bad movie . Tastes and opinions vary . So even some of the real stinkers that appeared on MST3K like Manos or Skydivers , I've seen without the riffing . But in the case of Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell , I cannot imagine watching it on its own . It's so bad and features so very little in the way of entertainment that MST3k appears to be the only way to go .
366212	3109237	85824	3.0	Major Disappointment	- From the moment I saw this listed as on the Mondo Macabro website , I was intrigued . It looked good and the reviews I read were mostly positive . So when it was finally released , I couldn't wait to get my hands on it . After watching it , I wish I would have waited . - What a major disappointment . Right from the start , I knew that Panic Beats couldn't meet my expectations . The whole look and feel of the film is terrible . It has that straight-to-video look that usually destroys atmosphere . The sets are nothing special at all . Most of the film looks like it could have been shot in my house . The story is incredibly predictable . There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot , but most are telegraphed from a mile away . The gore scenes are horribly done . And the whole concept of a knight that comes back from the dead is straight out of Scooby Doo . It's not a very frightening image . - Paul Naschy does his best to provide some chills . With raised eyebrows and a menacing stare , he does his best to look frightening . But for the most part , it doesn't work . The most frightening scenes are of Naschy naked in the bathtub . Now that had me screaming . - As for Mondo Macabro's disc , it's very well done . I have no complaints with the image , sound , or subtitles . The extras are quite nice , including a brief history of Spanish horror .
366112	3109237	51173	3.0	Where's the voodoo ?	There is a reason for the 4 . 2 IMDb rating . This film isn't very good . The cast is fine . Boris Karloff stars along with a decent supporting cast including Elisha Cook Jr . ( Wilmer from The Maltese Falcon ) . The story concerns a group of people that go to investigate the strange happenings on an island in the Pacific . Other than a few man-eating plants ( that could have easily been avoided ) nothing much happens . There is very little voodoo to speak of . And when the group meets the voodoo chief on this PACIFIC island , he's a white guy . But my main problem with the film is the script . The actors are given some of the stupidest things to say I've ever heard . Any given character is likely to say or do anything at any given moment regardless of the situation . I would only recommend this to a Karloff completist .
366177	3109237	74350	3.0	I've never been a fan of Space : 1999 - and this changes nothing	I grew up during 1960s and 1970s and there's still a lot of television from this period that I enjoy ? The Avengers , Rat Patrol , Hogan's Heroes , Charlie's Angels , and Mission : Impossible just to name a few examples . I bring this up because Cosmic Princess is essentially two episodes of Space : 1999 , a syndicated sci-fi television program produced from 1975 to 1977 . I was never a fan so cobbling two episodes together and calling it a movie has very little appeal to me . In a word , it's as dull as dishwater . Things take forever to happen . It's tedious to the nth degree . The sets and scripts make the original Star Trek ( another show I'm not a big fan of ) look like they spent a fortune . Maybe someone who actually enjoyed Space : 1999 would find something to like about Cosmic Princess ( and I know the show has fans ) , but I'm not that person . Because Cosmic Princess is two episodes of Space : 1999 , there are two distinct plots . The first ( originally called The Metamorph ) finds the crew of Moonbase Alpha in the clutches of Mentor ( Brian Blessed ) who wants to drain their souls to power a machine he hopes to use to restore his planet to its former glory . I'll admit , Blessed's performance is a treat . The man is an awesome actor . The crew escapes with Mentor's daughter , Maya , just before the planet blows up . In the second half of Cosmic Princess ( originally titled Space Warp ) , Maya transforms herself into a hideous being and goes on a rampage attempting to escape and return to her home planet . The highlight of this segment is an unintentionally hilarious moon buggy chase . Like many people who have seen Cosmic Princess in the past few years , I did so via a low quality DVD-R of an old Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode . This particular episode of MST3K was part of the Minneapolis public-access run before the show hit the " big time " . Some of the jokes work , but like a lot of the KTMA shows , the riffs are far too inconsistent to call it good . I'll give it a on my MST3K rating scale .
366880	3109237	87436	3.0	Morricone's score almost makes the movie worthwhile	In the past few weeks , I've watched a number of movies with Amazon-style man-hating tribes who only seek the company of men for the purposes of procreation . In this one , the Amazons are wiped out by a band of men . Wiped out , that is , except for a hunter / warrior named Hundra ( Laurene Landon ) who vows to get even for the slaughter of her sisters . It's also up to Hundra to repopulate her tribe if it is to survive . But to do so , Hundra will need the help of the very same men she seeks for revenge . Based on my rating , it should be obvious that I have some real problems with Hundra . Tops on that list would be the film's terribly mixed message . The movie tries to incorporate a lot of pseudo-feminist mumbo-jumbo into its plot with little success . It's all for show . You see the film is terribly hypocritical . On the one hand , the film seems to be trying to explore the empowerment of women - but at the same time the film exploits the very same women it purports to empower . The filmmakers seem to be trying to have their cake and eat it to ( Is that cliché enough for ya ? ) . Getting past the film's mixed message , Hundra is , for the most part , a poorly made , badly paced , and horribly acting movie . You would think that a plot involving this much bloodshed and sex would hold a little more interest . I , however , found myself nodding off several times throughout the movie . Dull and uninteresting doesn't begin to describe it . The version I saw clocked in at about 1 : 45 ? or about 30 minutes longer than it should have . As for the film's lead Laurene Landon , she's honestly one of the worst actresses I've seen in a while . Her delivery is so unnatural that it's distracting . Finally , the fight choreography is abysmal . Between Landon's unconvincing movements and the lack of any creativity in the fights , these scenes seem to drag on forever . And it doesn't help that the longest fight during Hundra's climax was shown in slow-motion . Before I end this , I feel I should mention one very obvious highlight of Hundra ? Ennio Morricone's score . It far exceeds anything else in the movie . It might not be Morricone's best , but it's certainly memorable . There's one particular piece of music played during the film's final fight scene that almost makes the movie worthwhile . It's that good .
366010	3109237	50718	3.0	Hopelessly Dull	After watching the first movie in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection , it's difficult to believe how excited I was about the set and how upset I was when the release date was pushed back . I've watched a lot of Mexican horror in recent months . Some great ? The Curse of the Crying Woman . Some entertaining despite obvious flaws ? Night of the Bloody Apes . And some Cheesy ? Pick any Santo movie . One thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called " dull " . Well , that's not the case with The Aztec Mummy . It's been awhile since I last watched something so sleep inducing . I wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie , but at least entertain me ! The Aztec Mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity . I guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material . Padding extraordinaire ! For example , for anyone who has seen the movie , what purpose does The Bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes ? I can only hope that the other two movies in The Collection are more entertaining than this one .
366661	3109237	71627	3.0	It's 903 corpses short	- A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old , supposedly cursed house where over the years , seven people have mysteriously died . One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie . It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using . But as the book is read , the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life . Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger . - IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes . For the first 60 of those minutes , nothing happens . Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie . Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting ? We already know that their movie isn't " real " . These scares just don't work . - There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses . The acting is atrocious . Most of these " actors " would have trouble making a elementary school play . The score is terrible . It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere . Speaking of atmosphere , other than a few moments at the end of the movie , there is none to speak of . Character logic is all but non-existent . Even in a movie , you expect characters to behave in a certain way . Here , I don't think I remember one scene where a character didn't choose the most illogical avenue available to them . And finally , there's those first 60 minutes of the movie that I've already mentioned . Can you say BORING ? - I haven't rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie ( probably by accident ) actually works . My two favorite are the beginning and ending . The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie . And , the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective ( what a ringing endorsement ) . Overall though , these moments aren't enough to make this a good movie .
366536	3109237	81178	3.0	Very Disappointing	- The Monster Club is a three story anthology held together by Vincent Price and John Carradine . The first story is about a wealthy , pale faced creature with few friends who falls in love with the hired help . She turns him down and must face the consequences . The second story is about a modern day vampire hiding out from modern day vampire hunters . The third story concerns a town of the beaten path inhabited by nothing but ghouls . - Story 1 - - It's not bad , just very predictable . With better writing , this story could make an entertaining feature length film on its own . I found the pale-faced creature to be unique and interesting . - Story 2 - - What utter garbage . The story goes for laughs and fails at every opportunity . All of the humor is incredible obvious and , as such , I found it insulting . It's a shame that a talent like Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland were wasted on drivel like this . - Story 3 - - Easily the best and most chilling of the stories . While the ghouls are not particularly scary looking , the continued and relentless attacks are effective scenes . The ending is a good piece of irony . - The In-Between Bits - - How embarrassing for Price and Carradine to be stuck in a mess like this . You can buy better looking monster masks at Wal Mart . The music that played between each story was especially rancid . - Take the four rating , add them together , and divide by 4 . The result - .

The girl has agreed to put her baby up for adoption through a private attorney rather than the State . After the baby is born , she changes her mind about the whole adoption process and wants to keep her baby . But the greedy attorney will hear none of this and goes ahead and gives the baby to parents that he secretly knows to be unfit . In steps Kate Carlin to save the day and put a stop to the baby-selling ring . Why do I subject myself to this kind of stuff ? I don't know if The Lifetime Network existed in 1981 , but Born to Be Sold is pure Lifetime melodrama . I'll admit that the situation the young girl found herself in was heartbreaking , but the way the film presents the story lacks a lot of realism . Take the scene where Kate Carlin spots an intruder in her home . The reaction on the part of the character and the lack of police involvement did not ring true . Or , take the greedy , slimy attorney played by Harold Gould . He's just a little too greedy and a little too slimy to be believable . To be a man in his position , he takes far too many chances and brags a little too much to be successful for very long . Again , it's not realistic .

Sure it was designed to cash-in on The Exorcist's success , but it's not the first movie to ride the coattails of another movie . Just look at all the sequels that Jaws spawned ( Piranha , Tintotera , Crocodile , etc . ) for an even better example . My problems with The Antichrist have nothing to do with comparisons to The Exorcist . Instead , I think that The Antichrist is a mess of a movie on its own . I suppose that for a movie of this type to be effective , it helps if the audience cares or has some sort of feelings for the characters . Other than the main character , Ippolita Oderisi ( Carla Gravina ) , we never learn enough about them to care what happens to them . As for Ippolita , she's so unlikable that I couldn't have cared less whether she was possessed or not . She's a bitter woman with no redeeming characteristics that I could discern . Even before the possession , she seems to relish making everyone's life miserable . And why should it bother me that she is possessed by the devil ? She asked for it ? literally . So , she got what she wanted . I had no sympathy for this woman , and without that , the movie doesn't work . There are other problems with The Antichrist beyond whether or not I cared about the main character . The acting is plain old bad . Even somewhat accomplished actors like Mel Ferrer look like their starring in the local amateur hour . In one scene , I swear he looks embarrassed to be anywhere near this film . The only actor of any consequence who comes off with any dignity in tact is Anita Strindberg and that's just because of her limited screen time . I suppose that I'll leave it at that and not write anymore about the other areas where the movie fails . Writing about everything I had a problem with in The Antichrist is like shooting fish in a barrel . I could target the special effects , a score that's not up to Morricone's high standards , or the cheap attempts to gross-out the audience , but you get the idea .
366841	3109237	90627	3.0	Another in a long line of bad Sword and Sorcerer movies	- I don't know who Alejandro Sessa is , but the Executive Producer on this piece of trash was Roger Corman . Amazons is just another example of the garbage that Corman allowed his name to be attached to in the 80s . Why Roger ? Why ? - Amazons is almost devoid of any real entertainment . It's boring , dull , and lifeless . The dialogue and action are ridiculous . The " acting " ( and I put that word in quotes because I'm not sure it's appropriate to call what these people are doing " acting " ) is abysmal . And the plot is pointless . The real plot is about having scantily clad women run around with swords - end of story . - So , why do I rate this a and not lower ? Regardless of how bad it is , I have a soft spot for these 1980s Sword and Sorcerer movies . No matter how bad they are , every four or five years , I rewatch ' em . Sick , huh ?
366894	3109237	70742	3.0	It's not hard to see why this one didn't make the network lineup	A malfunction in space sends astronaut Neil Stryker ( Glenn Corbett ) off course and headed to something of a parallel world , called Terra , circling the sun exactly opposite Earth . As a being from space would pose a threat to this world's order , Stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him . Stryker , however , gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes . With the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government , Stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to Earth . Stranded in Space ( or The Stranger if you prefer ) is another of those 70s made-for-TV movies that was to be turned into a regular , weekly show . In this case , it's easy to see why it didn't make it . First off , there's nothing new about the shows set-up . The show was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes . You know , a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter . It's a formula that's been done to death . The second strike against Stranded in Space is its lead , Glenn Corbett . Could this guy come across as any less likable ? I was rooting for him to get caught . Without sympathy for the main character , this kind of show would never work . Finally , this is supposed to be science fiction . What , just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon I'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet ? So it's a mere coincidence that they all speak English , dress just like people on Earth , and drive Plymouth Furies . Yeah , right . The lone highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast . Sure , it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful , but you know the old saying - any Cameron is better than no Cameron ( yeah , I've never heard it either ) . As with a lot of these 70s made-for-TV movies , I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination , but there are a few good jokes along the way . So in the end , while I rate the movie a , it gets a on my MST3K rating scale .
366528	3109237	859163	3.0	" You guys are like mummy magnets ! "	I caught The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor with the family this past Friday night and couldn't be more underwhelmed by the experience . I'm not much of a fan of the first two Brendan Fraser mummy movies , but with Jet Li in the cast I was actually looking forward to this one . I honestly didn't expect much more than a mindless action movie . But what I wasn't expecting was something quite this vapid . Bigger and louder with more explosions isn't always a good thing . The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor went beyond being mindless to the point it began to insult my intelligence . The tissue paper thin plot ( which I'm not going to bother to even go into ) seems as if it were made up on the spot and merely serves to string together a series of action set pieces . And there is little to no attempt made at character development . If you aren't familiar with the other movies in the series , I bet you'd be hard pressed to know anything about Brendan Fraser's character . And whose bright idea was it to have Luke Ford play Fraser's son ? Was he born when Fraser's character was about 12 or something ? Just one of the many examples I could cite of things that really bothered me about The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor . Despite what I've written so far , the movie isn't a total waste . Some of the action set pieces really do work despite the idiocy surrounding them . For example , my single favorite scene in the film is when Jet Li faces off with Michelle Yeoh . It's magical ! Unfortunately , that scene only lasts for a minute or so and we're back to the action by-the-numbers nonsense . Finally , I feel the need to mention the opening 10 or so minutes that provide a back-story for the Dragon Emperor and many of the events to come . That looks like it might have been an interesting and intelligent movie . I'd pay to see that story fleshed out . What I won't pay for , however , is anymore of these Gawd awful mummy movies .
366777	3109237	597034	3.0	Lame	While I'm generally a fan of The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries , I'm not such a fan that I can't spot a bad episode . And it seems that in Season 2 , there are a lot of bad episodes . Mystery of the Avalanche Express is one of the worst . To begin with , the plot it just ridiculous . War profiteers ? Asylum seekers ? That's not the kind of stuff I associate the Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew getting mixed up in . What happened to the haunted barns or the UFOs or the other cool mysteries ? Neither the Hardys nor Nancy Drew do much of anything to solve a case or bring about a resolution to the situation . It's almost as if it's someone else's plot they just accidentally got involved in . For lack of a better word , Mystery of the Avalanche Express doesn't have the Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew " feel " to it . Next , I never cared for Janet Julian taking over the role of Nancy Drew , but in this episode , she's absolutely terrible . She's got some of the most unnaturally delivery I've heard . And she just doesn't fit the part . She looks too young . Like the scene where she's announces she a private investigator - it reminded me of a child with an overactive imagination making things up . Finally , when The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries originally aired , they were geared toward a young demographic . Can someone please explain to me the bizarre casting decision to hire the likes of Fabian , Edd Byrnes ( complete with laughable accent ) , Deborah Walley , Vic Damone , and a bunch of other has-beens for this episode ? I'm sure the kids in 1978 were beside themselves with the anticipation of seeing Tommy Sands ! I can't remember , but I'm sure I was . It's so lame !
366378	3109237	69005	3.0	When bunnies go bad !	The local ranchers are up in arms over the rabbits that have taken over their fields and destroyed the land they use for grazing their herds . A scientist comes up with the idea of using experimental gene therapy to wipe out the rabbits . But when one of his test rabbits escapes , the consequences prove deadly . The gene experiments have created a bunch of giant , blood-thirsty bunnies . KILLER RABBITS ! Is there any reason to say much more ? How in the world did Night of the Lepus get the green-light ? It's got to be one of the most ridiculous premises ever for a horror movie . I don't care how hard you try , you simply cannot make a rabbit look vicious . Most of the " special " effects consist either of filming rabbits from a low vantage point to try to make them look huge or of rabbits jumping around miniature sets of barns and houses . I'll admit that the sight of a rabbit with blood covering its mouth is a bit unsettling . But scary ? Not in the least . There must have been some actors hard-up for work in Hollywood in 1972 . For a movie about killer rabbits , Night of the Lepus boasts a cast far beyond what you would expect . I'm assuming that the good movie offers weren't rolling-in for Janet Leigh when this movie was made . The rest of the cast includes Stuart Whitman , Rory Calhoun , and DeForest Kelley . Each does an adequate job considering the embarrassing material they were working with . I realize that my rating ( ) is probably too high . Night of the Lepus really isn't even that good . But it does possess a certain camp appeal that I find some entertainment in . The cheese-factor alone is worth a point or two .
366232	3109237	65163	4.0	" He who takes from Gwangi the evil one is cursed . "	I'm racking my brain , but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi . A Western with dinosaurs ? What could be more natural ? You gotta wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it ! The plot ? While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus , TJ Breckenridge ( Gila Golan ) , Tuck Kirby ( James Franciscus ) , and the rest of the cast / characters enter a strange , lost valley . There they find not only the miniature horse , but some other , more fearsome creatures as well . Dinosaurs rule this place . Now wouldn't that be an attraction at TJ's circus ? a caged T-Rex ? It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie , I just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie . There are some parts that I actually find almost unwatchable . For the first half of the movie , there just doesn't seem to be much going on . I wasn't necessarily bored , but I did want something to happen . Plodding would be an adjective I would use . To top it off , the movie features a very contrived love story . It feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together . But The Valley of the Gwangi isn't a total waste . There are moments I really enjoyed . Who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a T-Rex . You just don't see stuff like that every day . Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive . There are some really cool shots of Harryhausen's miniatures interacting with people and horses . It might not represent the best of his work , but the effects are very nice . Still , at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the negatives . As much as I hate to do it , I've got to rate The Valley of the Gwangi a .
365987	3109237	929551	4.0	One of the weakest I've seen so far	As Urko plans his latest campaign to wipe-out the humanoids , Ape City is terrorized by a flying , prehistoric beast . The apes are not alone as the creature sees fit to frighten the humanoids and actually steals one of their cow-like creatures . Once again , Jeff , Bill , and Judy must save the human race . " Attack from the Clouds " has to be one of the very weakest installments I've seen so far in the Return to the Planet of the Apes series . The poor animation really hurts this one . The high flying scenes of creature and plane should be exciting . But not the way they're handled here . It's dull all the way through . And it doesn't help that much of the existing story line is pushed to the background . Oh well , there's always the next episode .
366460	3109237	98193	4.0	Funny , but little else to recommend	- The evil Dr . Arcane ( Louis Jourdan ) , thought to be dead at the end of the original Swamp Thing , is alive and well . His life , however , will be short-lived unless he is able to reverse his cell degeneration . Up to this point , his experiments have yielded only horribly disfigured mutants . Fortunately for the Doctor , his step daughter , Abby ( Heather Locklear ) , arrives to confront him about her mothers death . With her DNA , Arcane may be able to save himself . But , lurking nearby is Swamp Thing - Dr . Arcane's nemesis who is intent on stopping him . - I've seen this movie at least a half a dozen times . With each viewing , I want it to be good . Although bits and pieces are enjoyable , overall it's just not a very good movie . For the most part The Return of Swamp Thing fails at being an action movie , it fails at being a sci-fi movie , and it fails at being a horror movie . Some of the acting , particular that of Monique Gabrielle , is noticeably wooden . I doubt that Gabrielle has ever delivered a line that sounded natural . Some of the special effects , particularly a few of the mutants , are anything but special . Many of the plot points can be seen from a mile away . For example , when we are introduced to Abby , we are told that she's the kind of person who prefers plants to people . Gee , I wonder who will be her love interest in the movie ? - The movie does achieve a little success , however , at being a comedy . Some of the lines are genuinely funny . For example , when Swamp Thing reminds Abby that their budding relationship will be hampered because he's a plant , her response " That's okay , I'm a vegetarian . " Not great , but it does bring a smile to my face . Another scene that I'm fond of involves Jourdan poking a little fun at himself . Jourdan's pet parakeet happens to be named Gigi . Jourdan sings a little song to Gigi that's a take-off of the songs in what may be his most famous movie , Gigi . - As I had seen this movie several times before , on this occasion I watched with the commentary on Image's DVD . Few commentaries are as informative as this one . Listening to Director Wynorski , it's amazing the detail he remembers about making The Return of Swamp Thing . It's one of the better commentaries I've heard in a while .
366518	3109237	72006	4.0	Another movie I really wanted to like	Policewoman Lacy Bond ( Sondra Currie ) longs for more interesting and meaningful assignments than guarding female prisoners . After almost single handedly thwarting a mass prison escape , Lacy catches the eye of her superiors and is finally given her big chance . Her assignment ? go undercover to bust up an all-girl smuggling ring . But she better be careful , because this gang is deadly . I loved the opening prison break scenes . They had a quirky feel to them that worked . After the first 10 minutes , I thought for sure I had found a winner . But after getting off to a great start , once the real plot kicks in , Policewomen loses steam . What should have been a wild , fun ride turns into . . . well , in a word , it gets boring . The plot has way too much talk and not enough action or sleaze . The case that Lacy Bond finds herself involved in isn't terribly interesting . I can't really blame Sondra Currie . She may not be the best actress I've seen ( in fact , she's downright bad ) , but she sure does give it her all . I am happy , however , to see that after Policewomen she went on to have a good career . The casting of Elizabeth Stuart as the ring-leader Maude and Phil Hoover as her boyfriend Doc was an interesting choice . I'm not saying it was a good choice , just interesting . Policewomen also features some of the sloppiest editing I've run into recently . Big , obtrusive splices right in the middle of action scenes . It's pretty obvious that Currie and the other actors had problems with the action so cuts had to be made to set-up and finish a scene . It's really weak . The film's final scenes do help redeem the movie somewhat , but not enough to make me call the movie " good " . For what it's worth , I've rated Policewomen a very generous .
366250	3109237	69700	4.0	I think it was filmed through a layer of mud	I watched Battle of the Amazons only a few hours ago and I'm already having problems remembering many of the particulars about the movie . It wasn't necessarily as bad as some of the other movies I watch , just unmemorable . You'd think a movie about a band of Amazon warriors that raids a town to kidnap young men for sex slaves would standout more than that . But that's apparently not the case . The movie follows the same plot line we've all seen any number of times . The Amazons raid a small village . Those left in the village fear the Amazons will be back . The villagers hire a band of outlaws to train them to fight . Of course it all leads to a climatic brawl where the villagers come out on top and , in the end , the outlaws redeem themselves and decide to stay on . Can anyone tell me where they've seen this before ? Magnificent Seven maybe ? How about Seven Samurai ? As I indicated , it's been done to death . Battle of the Amazons is a dreary looking affair . It's almost as if the director decided to film the movie through a layer of mud . The acting is generally abysmal . The lone exception is Lucretia Love ( Is that a cool name or what ? ) who I've begun to notice recently in a few movies . By the way , I got a kick out of the fact that Love's character , Eraglia , was the only Amazon that brought back a female when they raided the village . The final fight scene is pretty much a letdown . I also found it humorous that the Amazons don masks for their climatic battle . This was done so that the females could be replaced by men in wigs . Did they think no one would notice that the shapely Amazons suddenly turned into beefy men ? One highlight from Battle of the Amazons for me was the score . Although it would have been more at home in a Spaghetti Western , the music was quite nice .
366723	3109237	62159	4.0	It's like a bad British version of The Fly	Professor Paul Steiner is doing research in matter transference . He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear , only to have that object re-materialize in a different location . But there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed . After a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding , Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself . As expected , things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill . In hindsight , maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re-watch The Projected Man in the same week I watched The Fly , Return of the Fly , and Curse of the Fly . There seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period . I'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for The Projected Man , but much of it is so similar to the Fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence . However , The Projected Man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy . Besides being terribly unoriginal , The Projected Man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie . A big issue I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead . He's such a horse's ass that , not only do I not care about his suffering , I actually root for it . Supporting cast members Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad . They're so bland and dull they hardly matter . In fact , there's very little to get excited about while watching The Projected Man . The soundtrack ? not very memorable . The " look " ? I would describe much of it as " muddy " . The plot ? predictable . The action ? there isn't any . Overall , this is one to avoid . Fortunately , I watched The Projected Man via a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode . Funny stuff ! While not an absolute , very often , the poorer the movie ? the better the MST3K riffs . The guys hit almost all of their marks with The Projected Man . I'll give it a very enthusiastic on my MST3K rating scale .
366690	3109237	79168	4.0	" Whoever did this . . . they're as good as dead . "	Back when A Force of One was originally released , I viewed Chuck Norris ' movies as boring , brainless , and cheap . In the years since , I've changed that original assessment and can see them for what they really are . Now I look at these early Chuck Norris ' movies as fun , brainless , and cheap . The plot is incredibly simple and shows a total lack of creativity . When two cops are killed by someone using Martial Arts , they seek out the one man who might be able to help them ? the local karate champion , Matt Logan ( Norris ) . The cops quickly persuade Matt to help them , but when Matt's son turns up dead , he goes from helping to an active participant . Instead of writing a regular review or pointing out strengths and weaknesses in the movie , I'll just list a few random thoughts I had while watching : · It's not that the cops are skeptical about how karate can help them , a few act like they can't even pronounce the word . · The needle marks in that girl's arm makes it look like she been using a turkey-baster to shoot-up with . · You would think that after one set of cops is killed that the superior officer would do a better job of keeping track of where and what his men are working on . · Wow , a ninja in the stockroom ! You just don't see enough of stuff like that in real life . · If you couldn't guess that Matt's son was going to get into serious trouble when he started his own investigating , you haven't seen enough bad action movies . · The identities of the bad guys are so obvious it's embarrassing . · Why is the police captain wearing a Matt Logan t-shirt under his bath robe ? It may be bad , but there are still several enjoyable moments . One of my favorites is the most obvious ? watching Chuck Norris square off against Bill ' Superfoot " Wallace . Two legends of the Martial Arts in a fight to the death ? good stuff . It almost makes the whole movie worthwhile .
366529	3109237	445483	4.0	No Originality	- There is a curse affecting all who come into contact with it . It's spread like a horrible disease that only requires contact with an affected person . If you have the curse , you can expect to die a terrible , horrific death . The problem is that you may not know you've been cursed until it's too late and you see the black figure coming to get you . - If you are a fan of horror and the very brief description sounds familiar , don't be surprised . Ju-rei exhibits very little in the way of originality . It's the best parts of Ju-on or The Grudge repeated over and over . The ghosts look the same , sound the same , move the same , and have the same motivations . Furthermore , within the movie there is also little originality . The movie is divided into ten chapters . Once you've seen two or three of the chapters , you can pretty well guess what's going to happen next . One chapter is almost the same as the next chapter . There nothing much to make one chapter distinguishable from the others . While I found the first couple of chapters fairly frightening , the repetitive nature of the movie really hurts any scares in the later chapters . - The story is told backwards from chapter 10 to chapter 1 . At first this seemed to be an interesting , unique way of telling a story . Trying to figure out who was who and how they came into contact with the curse was part of the fun of playing along . But , after a few chapters , it really didn't seem to matter much . Again , the lack of originality really hurt the movie . - Another problem I had with the movie was the beginning and ending . Or , to put it in a better way , the lack of a beginning and the lack of an ending . The movie presents no resolution to the events in the movie . It just ends . Likewise , the movie does not present a clear starting point . It's as if the curse has always been there and we are just viewing part of it's progress . I felt very unsatisfied .
366612	3109237	53611	4.0	A movie you can enjoy with a good cup of coffee .	- A local trapper claims he saw something odd in the swamp . Of course no one puts much stock in his claims , so nothing is done . But as the bodies start piling up , the local officials realize that something strange is going on . They can no longer deny the fact that monsters live in the local waters . One of the locals wants to bomb the swamp and force the creatures to the surface . But the game warden is sworn to protect all life in the swamp and must be convinced ( he's gotta see the monsters for himself ) before he will allow such a dramatic step to be taken . - After you've seen as many of these quick , cheap , sci-fi / horror movies from the 50s and 60s as I have , you start to run out of adjectives to describe the abysmal acting , dialogue , and production values . I have now reached that point . The lack of what most people consider qualities of a good movie are as readily apparent here as any other movies of this type . So , I'm not going to even try to discuss these things . - I haven't rated this movie as low as similar movies . This one has a quality about it that I found enjoyable . It could be that the characters in Attack of the Giant Leeches are somewhat likable . It could be that the story is presented in a more clever manner . Or , it could be that the movie is so bad that I reveled in the dreg . Whatever , unlike some of its brethren , Attack of the Giant Leeches is a movie I could see myself watching again in the future .
366831	3109237	63592	4.0	The presence of Bardot and Connery should have been enough to ensure a winner .	What a shame ! Shalako could have been so good . Two of the biggest stars in films at the time and a unique , fairly entertaining story should have made for a good movie . Instead , Shalako turns into a dull Western with too many traditional stereotypes , actors who give among the worst performances of their careers that I've seen , and an ending that will leave you scratching your head . The whole notion of a hunting party full of European aristocrats in the American Southwest is intriguing . Unfortunately , other than the odd dinner scene , nothing is made of this opportunity to present a different look at the West . Instead , Edward Dmytryk takes every opportunity possible to fill the plot with " good white people " and " bad Indians " . We've seen it before at least a million times . These are the same old stereotypes that had been around since the beginning of movies . The presence of Brigitte Bardot and Sean Connery should have been enough to ensure a winner . Both , however , appear terribly miscast and uninterested in what's going on . And then there's that ending . What a mess ! If a little fistfight was all it took to get the " bad Indians " off the trail of the " good white people " , why not have it out at the beginning of the movie and be done with it . Shalako features over an hour long build up to one of the more disappointing endings I've seen . It's not that the whole thing is a complete disaster . There are moments where Shalako really shines . The dinner scene I mentioned is a surreal moment that's very pleasing . Honor Blackman's death scene is another standout moment . And , watching the butler shine silver in the middle of the desert is something you don't ' see everyday . But these scenes are too few and far between to save Shalako .
366228	3109237	59440	4.0	Based on everything I knew about it , I thought this one was destined to be a winner	Over the years , I've gotten pretty good at spotting movies I know I'm going to enjoy . While many of these don't turn out to be in my Top 10 or anything , I generally find these movies enjoyable at a minimum . That's not the case with At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul . Given its cult following , subject matter , and recommendations from trusted individuals , I thought this one was destined to be a winner . I couldn't have been more wrong . At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul is the first of the Brazilian Coffin Joe films . Jose Mojica Marins is Zé do Caixão , the mortician in a small town he holds sway over through physical and psychological threats . He's not above committing murder to get his way . The film has a lot of surreal imagery going for it that is interesting to look at . It's too bad that it's all for naught as the film is so deadly dull . All the interesting set decoration and eye candy in the world can't save it . Zé makes an interesting character , but he hardly looks like the big tough guy , bullying around everyone in town . He's more like a skinny little kid playing dress-up with a cape and top hat who throws tempter tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants . I still don't understand why a couple of the husky Brazilian townsfolk didn't get together and beat the snot out of Zé . Finally , there's the ending . After and hour and some odd minutes of At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul , I hoped my experience could be salvaged by a strong finale . Again , I was disappointed . That has to be one of the more unsatisfying endings I've seen recently . Despite what I've written , I haven't given up on Coffin Joe just yet . I still plan to give This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse a chance . I only hope its better .
366791	3109237	93296	5.0	My one word review - Uneven	Jane and the Lost City is the story of a band of plucky but incompetent band of Allies in a race to fortune in diamonds with an equally incompetent band of Nazis . Along the way , both groups run into a series of mildly amusing adventures and situations , including title character Jane's ability to lose her clothing at the most inopportune moments . As I've never seen the comic strip Jane and the Lost City is based on , I probably don't have the proper context in which to place this movie . That's no necessarily a bad thing as I also have no preconceived biases . The entire thing is played for laughs . Unfortunately , the comedy sequences in Jane and the Lost City are too uneven for me to rate the film any higher . While some of the comedy worked ( the tango scene is hysterical ) , some of it fell flat ( most everything Nazi henchman Hans did wasn't funny in the slightest ) . The acting is also uneven and ranges from really good ( Graham Stark as the butler Tombs ) to dreadful ( Kristen Hughes as Jane ) . Overall , I like the idea behind Jane and the Lost City , but more consistency in the writing and acting would have made this one much better .
366374	3109237	37099	5.0	Continuity ? What's that ?	In this installment of Universal's Kharis mummy series , George Zucco is back as Andoheb , High Priest of Arkan . He sends his loyal servant Yousef Bey ( John Carradine ) to America to reunite Kharis with his love Ananka ( to have been dead for thousands of years , this woman is a lot of trouble ) . Tana leaves are brewed , the mummy comes back to life , and Ananka's spirit is transferred into the body of another woman . Will Kharis find his true love before the storyline changes ? Attempting to keep up with the ever-changing storyline in Universal's Kharis mummy series can be a daunting challenge but part of the fun of these movies . Some of the obvious examples in The Mummy's Ghost include - - - - 1 . How is Andoheb back again ? He was apparently killed in both of the previous two mummy movies . 2 . Arkan ? It was Karnak in the first two Kharis movies . 3 . In the previous movies , Kharis ' purpose was to protect Ananka's tomb and seek revenge on anyone who dared to defile it . All of a sudden , the mission changes to reuniting Kharis with Ananka so they can return to their tombs in Egypt . 4 . Kharis has been burned twice yet there doesn't appear to be so much as a singe on any of his wrappings . 5 . How many Tana leaves does it take to bring Kharis back to life ? The number changes from movie to movie . - - - - If all this sounds confusing , just watch what happens in the next sequel . Continuity doesn't appear to have been very high on the priority list . With the exception of The Mummy's Hand , the Kharis films have fairly interchangeable parts . One is not much better or worse than the others . And while there are moments in each I enjoy , it's difficult to call any of the last three Kharis films " good " . At best , The Mummy's Ghost is a harmless , sometimes entertaining way to spend an hour or so . I watch these movies over and over because I'm a sucker for mummy movies and mummy lore . The whole concept of a mummy coming back to life fascinates me like few other movie monsters .
365926	3109237	72356	5.0	What a title !	What a title ! Just imagine The Inconsolable Widow Thanks All Those Who Consoled Her ( let's shorten that to The Inconsolable Widow for the rest of this ) on a marquee . The movie is about a childless widow named Catarina Prevosti ( Edwige Fenech ) . Because Catarina gave her husband no heirs , Italian law mandates that his fortune revert to his blood relatives ? his two bumbling brothers . Catarina's mother , naturally , cooks up a plan for her and Catarina to keep the money . If Catarina should become pregnant in the next couple of weeks , no one will know the child isn't her husband's . The brothers figure out what's going on an do everything they can , including posting guards around Catarina's house , to keep any man away from Catarina . I haven't seen very many 70s Italian comedies , but The Inconsolable Widow appears to be about average . Some of the comedy works while a lot of it falls flat . I found the whole set-up , complete with armed guards , quite humorous . Much of the humor is quite naturally centered on sex and would be considered very politically incorrect in our current environment . As I could have predicted , these are the parts that I found the funniest . One of my favorite scenes involves Catarina's mother giving a would be suitor a pep talk before he heads to the bedroom . This is the first of Edwige Fenech's comedies I've seen . Based on what I got out of The Inconsolable Widow , I think I'll track down a few more .
366877	3109237	929553	5.0	Run Bill , Run	The second episode in Return to the Planet of the Apes , " Escape from Ape City " , primarily follows the plight of Bill as he is taken to Cornelius and Zira's lab for experimentation . Bill quite naturally proves to be brighter than the average human . But when brain surgery is suggested , Bill blows his cover and the apes discover he can speak . Not wanting to see him put to death , Cornelius and Zira agree to help Bill escape . As with the first episode , " Escape from Ape City " doesn't provide many surprises for those familiar with the basic storyline found in Planet of the Apes . The plot closely mirrors Taylor's ordeal from the movie . One interesting change is that ape city and the civilization presented in this episode more closely resembles Pierre Boulle's original book . It's a more advanced culture with transportation , communication , and other " modern " infrastructure . Also , I feel I should mention that I do enjoy the way the story arc continues from one episode to the next . It gives the overall series a more natural flow .
366201	3109237	53219	5.0	" I know something terrible happened , something even more terrible than suicide or murder "	Following the death of his mother , Philippe Delambre ( Brett Halsey ) decides to continue the work his father began 15 years previous . His father's experiments in matter transference ended disastrously . Philippe promises his uncle , Francois Delambre ( Vincent Price ) , he'll be more careful and not make the same mistake that took his father's life . But as luck would have it , Philippe is destined to the same horrible fate . Through a one in a million accident , he's turned into a half fly , half human . Though he wasn't able to help Philippe's father , maybe this time Uncle Francois can find the fly and save Philippe . Return of the Fly is a quick and cheap follow-up to The Fly . Though there are things to enjoy , it's something of a disappointment given the original . The sequel lacks the mystery of the first movie . In this one , we are expected to just accept the whole transference process and that a man can be turned into a fly . No suspense , no atmosphere ? nothing . And what about the son Philippe meeting the same fate as his father ? I called it a million to one accident ? well it's probably more like a trillion to one . Can't the Delambre family get some pest strips or hire an exterminator or something ? The notion of a fly getting in the transference machine twice is ridiculous . There are other problems ( the fly special effects and the theft subplot for example ) , but these are the two things that bothered me the most . Oh , but it's not all bad . The acting is okay . I've never been much of a fan of Brett Halsey , but here he's actually good . Vincent Price is always enjoyable even when , as here , he doesn't have much of anything to do . Also , the scenes of the fly stalking his prey in the funeral home are effective . I'll admit that I jumped every time he popped out of the shadows . Finally , despite the movie's problems and shortcomings , it's still fairly fun . As I've written any number of times now , entertainment is the most important thing when it comes to a movie for me . And while I wasn't bowled over or anything by Return of the Fly , I still had a decent time with it .
366442	3109237	62808	5.0	Franco's Spy Film	- Since I recently watched Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik , I had an urge to see some other , lesser known spy movies . This is Jess Franco's attempt at the genre and he almost pulls it off . If it weren't for some lapses in action ( and logic ) this one would have been very good . But far too often , nothing much of interest is going on . In a typical James Bond movie , there are many instances where the action stops to further the plot . In The Girl from Rio , these stops in the action do nothing to advance the story . They are just there . - Franco probably had one of the bigger " name " casts in The Girl from Rio that he ever worked with . Shirley Eaton , from Goldfinger , is the villainous Sumuru . George Sanders , who I always get a kick out of watching , is very funny as the equally villainous Sir Masius . The biggest problem with the casting is Richard Wyler as the films hero . He's not interesting enough to carry the part . - Having watched a few Franco movies over the past few years , The Girl from Rio is decidedly tame . While the movie has its moments , the usual Franco sleaze is not evident . Too bad - it might have made some of the non-action moments more tolerable .
366349	3109237	76554	5.0	I can't believe I'm saying this , but more Joan would have also been a plus for the film .	Maurizio Merli plays a small-time private detective hired to find a missing girl . His hunt leads him to Austria and the case of a dead girl that he's sure is connected to the girl he's looking for . He learns that the girls were involved with a gang dealing in child prostitution . Merli has to get act fast if he's to save the life of the girl he's looking for . The more I see of Maurizio Merli , the more I enjoy his performances . After my first experiences with him , I saw Merli as little more than a pretty-boy , Franco Nero wannabe . But recently , I've begun to see he's got a lot to offer of his own . He's as good in the action scenes as Nero and probably better at the more comedic moments . He shows both in Fatal Charm . Whether it's taking out the bad guys or pulling a scam on the local police , he's got real screen presence and a definite charm . Fatal Charm ( aka Fearless , aka Poliziotto senza paura , aka Magnum Cop ) could have been so much better had the plot not been so muddled and confusing . Part of it may be due to the dubbing , but the film definitely goes off in tangents that would have been best left alone . It seems to take forever for Merli to get to the bottom of things . For example , there's a whole series of scenes with Merli playing up his operations to an Austrian detective . It's pointless and doesn't really work . A tighter script would have served Fatal Charm well . My copy of Fatal Charm gives top billing to Joan Collins . And while her scenes are memorable ( she gets naked for God's sake ) , she only has about 15 minutes of screen time . I can't believe I'm saying this , but more Joan would have also been a plus for the film .
366052	3109237	465569	5.0	" If you seek corroboration , interrogate my pillow . "	When the daughter of a wealthy American industrialist is murdered aboard the Blue Train from Calais to Nice , Hercule Poirot ( David Suchet ) is pressed into service to assist the local police in finding a killer . With plenty of suspects , an attack on another passenger , and a missing world famous ruby , Poirot has his hands full . As a little background , it has been ages since I last read Agatha Christie's book on which this movie is based . Therefore , I am in no position to comment on its faithfulness ( or lack thereof ) to the source material . Instead , all I can do is comment on the story presented in the movie . Watching The Mystery of the Blue Train is like watching a tale of two movies . The first , involving the film's plot , the acting , the look , etc . , is quite enjoyable . The plot unfolds nicely and the film's resolution makes sense . And I always enjoy watching Poirot gather the suspects together for a final reveal . The acting was actually a step above what I've come to expect from the Poirot series . The sets and costumes are very nicely done . I was particularly impressed with the French villa . But as I indicated , this is a tale of two movies . What I've thus far described would have made for one of the better entries in the Poirot series . Unfortunately , the direction is PATHETIC . I don't know who decided to try to make a Hercule Poirot mystery look like an episode of NYPD Blue , but they should be drummed out of the entertainment industry immediately . There are so many hand-held camera shots that I thought I might get seasick . Why not shoot this traditional , grand story in a more traditional style ? The editing doesn't help matters any . It's all MTV-style quick cuts that do not lend themselves well to what should have been a slow-burn , drawing room style mystery . It's unfortunate that the direction and editing have made The Mystery of the Blue Train almost unwatchable .
366903	3109237	892782	5.0	" Boys , set the terror level at code brown , ' cause I need to change my pants . "	Last weekend , I took my 6 year-old son to see the 3-D version of Monsters vs Aliens . For a user comment on the movie , I thought I would do something a little different and interview him to get his thoughts . Me : So , what did you think of Monsters vs Aliens ? Son : Good ( Let me explain a little about his one word answer . My son is a very articulate , bright little boy . But for some reason , when it comes to using positive adjectives , he seems to only know one ? " Good " . And he uses it alone ? no subject or verb as in " It was good " ? just " Good " . The only problem is that to my son , " Good " is used to describe anything from an ice cream cone to a trip to Disney World . What did you think about that pizza ? Answer - Good . How was school today ? Answer - Good . What would you think if I gave you a million dollars ? Answer ? Good . So take his " Good " as you will . ) Me ( trying to drag something else out of him ) : What was your favorite part ? Son : When Ginormica was busting through the wall . Me : Was any of the movie funny ? Son : Yes ? It was funny when Bob got stepped on . Me : What did you think of the 3-D effects ? Son : Good . ( See what I mean ? ) Me : Would you recommend it to your friends at school ? Son : Yes , it was really good ( What ? Really good ? Where did that come from ? ) . There you have it ? a succinct review from a reasonably typical 6 year-old kindergärtner . As for me , the movie was only okay . The 3-D effects were often breathtaking . And some of the comedy hit the mark . I especially enjoyed Hugh Laurie as Dr . Cockroach . But the plot was overly simple and very predictable . There were few if any surprises . And I really didn't like the way the monsters were used . They were often little more than comic relief and had no real purpose . So while my son may say " Good " , I say " Average " . A from me .
366540	3109237	71033	5.0	" These humans are dangerous , don't you understand that ? "	For those familiar with the Planet of the Apes movies , the television series should seem terribly familiar . Alan Virdon ( Ron Harper ) and Pete Burke ( James Naughton ) are two astronauts who crash land on Earth some 1 , 000 years in the future . Centuries previous , man effectively destroyed his civilization allowing intelligent , talking apes to assume control . Now the two astronauts , with the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee named Galen ( Roddy McDowell ) , will have to evade capture if they are to stay alive and find a way back home . Not a whole lot of originality in the series set-up . It effectively plays like a marriage between the Planet of the Apes movies and another TV offering , Land of the Giants , that aired four to five years previous . Almost everything is a cheap imitation of the movie . Not that the Planet of the Apes movies had extravagant budgets , but the sets , locations , special effects , and make-up are all less expensive versions of what came before . Even the actors were second tier compared with the likes of Charlton Heston , James Whitmore , Maurice Evans , and Kim Hunter . The lone exception is Roddy McDowell . Even though he plays Galen and not the better known Cornelius , he is quite honestly one of the few bright spots . Just watch McDowell in scenes with other apes . He's got the facial movements , the posture , and the walk the others actors don't quite have . Ron Harper and James Naughton are the two main human characters . While nether is particular bad in the series , nether one does anything to distinguish himself either . It's really not surprising that Planet of the Apes didn't make it on television . Beyond lacking originality , 1974 was a time shows like All in the Family and Maude ruled the airwaves . It was also a time when families like mine only had one television and people like my Dad weren't in the mood for " kid's shows " as he put it . It never had a chance .
366405	3109237	61557	5.0	I always think of bees when I'm looking for relaxation	Vicki Robbins ( Suzanna Leigh ) is a singer in bad need of a rest . Her doctor contacts his friend , Ralph Hargrove ( Guy Doleman ) , with a farm on a remote island that promises to provide Vicki the relaxation she desperately needs . When Vicki arrives , she discovers that Mr . Hargrove raises bees . So when Mr . Hargrove starts acting suspiciously and people begin dying from deadly bee attacks , it's natural for Vicki to suspect her host . But is Mr . Hargrove behind the trouble on Seagull Island ? Given the names behind The Deadly Bees , it's understandable to hope , if not expect , something better than this . Even with Amicus Productions , Freddie Francis , and Robert Bloch involved with the movie , there are far too many problems to call The Deadly Bees " good " . Three prime examples of the movie's many faults include : - Special / Visual Effects ? Most people tend to focus on the bee attacks when discussing the effects found in The Deadly Bees . And with good reason ? they're bad . But the bee effects practically shine in comparison with the matte painting used as the background for the farm . In a word , it's pitiful . It wouldn't fool anyone . - Characters ? None of the characters involved with the plot are in any way likable . Even the films heroine , Vicki Robbins , hasn't got much going for her . And that makes it almost impossible to root for her or care what happens to her when she comes across as so unlikable . - Plot ? For a movie that throws one red herring after another at the audience , it's too easy to see the outcome of The Deadly Bees from a mile away . None of the many plot twists actually work . Only the incredibly dimwitted characters in the movie like Vicki Robbins would find the outcome mysterious in anyway . There are more . I haven't even mentioned the unforgivably large plot holes or the ridiculous lapses in logic . But regardless of The Deadly Bees myriad of problems , I can't bring myself to rate the movie any lower than . Why ? Despite itself , The Deadly Bees never fails to provide me with some degree of entertainment . Otherwise , how can I explain why I've now seen the movie at least three times ? And , as I've always said , entertainment is the most important thing when it comes to movies and the reason I watch them .
366593	3109237	67069	5.0	" I am the last gladiator in the New Rome . "	- Evel Knievel purports to be a biography of the life of the real Evel Knievel . The movie presents stories and episodes from different periods throughout his life . We see Evel as a young boy in Butte , Montana . We see him grow to become a local hoodlum . We see him meet , date , kidnap , and marry his wife . We see him on his first paying job as a motorcycle daredevil . We see him in the hospital after his horrific crash at Ceasar's Palace . All of this is presented in a series of flashbacks as Evel prepares himself to make a jump over 19 cars . - I have no idea how much of what is presented is true . I feel confident , however , that there are quite a few dramatic licenses taken with Evel's life . For example , I sincerely doubt someone could be responsible for two dynamite explosions in the City Hall on the same night and no one notice who was responsible . Don't you think the police might have asked the local dynamite dealer if anyone had recently made a purchase ? I sincerely believe Evel would have spent a considerable amount of time in prison if this episode of his life , as presented , were true . - The " Tan Man " , George Hamilton ( who also produced the movie ) , plays Evel . And while he may bear no resemblance to the real man , he does a decent job copying Evel's walk and speech pattern . - While the movie is not great , there are a couple of moments in the film that make it worth watching at least once .
365962	3109237	47860	6.0	Solid - but not what i was expecting	My rating of Battle Cry has more to do with my disappointment with the plot than the actually quality of the movie . I knew nothing of the movie before I watched it , but with a name like Battle Cry , I was expecting a war movie along the lines of Battleground ( with which it is paired in the double feature DVD I bought ) . Instead , Battle Cry has more in common with a soap opera than a real war movie . The movie spends over two hours of its time on relationships and love affairs . When the real battle scenes finally begin , they're over and done with in less than 10 minutes . That's not to say I didn't enjoy the stories of the Marines and their women , it's just not what I was expecting . I am sure that on repeat viewings my enjoyment of the movie and rating I've given it will increase . Most of the movie is very well done . Like most other reviews I've read , I am especially fond of the scenes involving Pfc Andy Hookens ( Aldo Ray ) and Pat Rogers ( Nancy Olson ) . I found it a very believable , heartfelt story that's played perfectly by both actors . The rest of the cast is solid and their plot lines are almost as enjoyable . I was shocked at the frank presentation of some of the subject matter in Battle Cry . I can't think of another movie from the 50s , especially a flag-waving war movie , where sex , pregnancy , drinking , and adultery are dealt with so openly . It's a nice change-of-pace from the sanitized WWII movies I've come to expect .
366882	3109237	63210	6.0	Some nice shots of a mid-60s Miami	If you take a look at what I wrote about Tony Rome a couple of years ago , you can apply a lot of it to Lady in Cement . Once again , this is a movie that I probably enjoy more than I should . That's because for the most part , it entertains me . Plot details hardly matter as the whole thing is little more than a vehicle for Frank Sinatra to show his supposed coolness . I'll just say that Lady in Cement is well paced with very few dull moments . Other than a handful of really seedy looking locations , it's a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half . To be as light as much of it is , however , there are a few nice twists and turns along the way . In fact , the identity of one of the killers really caught me off-guard . Sinatra may be the " star " , but he's not the attraction here for me . Instead , Dan Blocker and Raquel Welch are the films highlights ? and in two very different ways . Blocker is very entertaining as the huge behemoth of a man , Waldo Gronsky . And Raquel is equally entertaining in her own way as wealthy socialite Kit Forrest . Finally , as with Tony Rome , I get a real kick out of the shots of a mid-60s Miami . Forty years later it looks almost like a foreign country . I suppose the thing that bothers me the most about Lady in Cement is the amount of lame comedy found in the script ( although the scene with Blocker watching Bonanza on television made me laugh out loud for some reason ) . You'll find comedy in Tony Rome , but I don't remember this much . The worst is the over-the-top gay-bating that Sinatra tries to use as humor . It has a terribly dated feel to it and , as some would argue , is quite offensive .
366558	3109237	78313	6.0	Lee Van Cleef & Karen Black - What a Pair ! ! !	- A retired safecracker ( Lee Van Cleef ) is lured out of retirement by the son of one of his buddies who is in trouble . The job - steal a load of diamonds from a warehouse safe . Things go terribly wrong . Van Cleef is wounded and everyone else is dead . Now , Van Cleef must elude the man who set-up the job , the man who owns the warehouse , and the police . It seems that Van Cleef's only ally is a crazy woman ( Karen Black ) who is the only other resident in an abandoned apartment building . - Over the years I've noticed that when the material he's faced with isn't first rate , Lee Van Cleef can overact with the best of them . And that's what he does here . There are many scenes where Van Cleef makes some of the most ridiculous faces for no purposes other than overemphasizing his point . It get very distracting . But in The Squeeze , he's outdone by Karen Black . She chews scenery like her life depended upon it . I just had to laugh a couple of times ( inappropriate times ) because it was all too funny . I suppose that most of the blame for the acting weaknesses could be traced directly to the script . The characters are given some really lame lines . - The story itself is quite nice . There's one double-cross after the next . The ending really caught me off guard . Just when I thought I had things figured out , I was hit with another loop . The plot is the primary reason I've rated this movie as I have . If you're a fan of heist films , much of The Squeeze will appeal to you . - I would be remiss if , even in this short review , I didn't mention the soundtrack . The music is pure ( bad ) 70s disco . The main theme song is especially annoying and presents everything that was wrong with music from this period . Even worse , it's stuck in my head - Oh the Pain !
366827	3109237	75834	6.0	A tragic life - A tragic death	Based on a true story from 1930 , The Pyjama Girl Case is a difficult movie to categorize . It is more often than not considered an Italian Giallo , but is it really a Giallo ? Even though I've included it on my Top 50 Giallo list , The Pyjama Girl Case differs so much from the model that I'm not sure this label is accurate . There is no black-gloved , masked killer . There is no string of over-the-top murders . The Pyjama Girl Case lacks the stylish look of most Gialli . And , there is no sense of dread or real tension usually associated with the genre . So , why do I include The Pyjama Girl Case on my list of favorite Gialli ? this is not a good answer , but I do it because everyone else does . If it's not a real Giallo , then what is The Pyjama Girl Case ? I would say it best fits in the drama category with touches of a police procedural thrown in for good measure . The Pyjama Girl Case is the story of a mysterious half-burned body found in an abandoned car on a beach . In addition to being burned , the body also shows signs of severe head trauma and a bullet through the neck . The case is particularly interesting to Inspector Thompson ( Ray Milland ) , a retired detective wanting one last case to investigate . Using outdated techniques and very few clues , he is determined to find the killer before he rides off into the sunset . I disagree with a lot of what I've read and feel Milland is one of the films weak points . His crotchety old man routine is rather predictable . His Inspector Thompson is the cliché for the " non-conforming just because I'm old " type character . The Pyjama Girl Case's structure can be off-putting to some . In addition to the police investigation , the film also features a concurrent look at the events leading up to the girl's death . It can be confusing at first because of the uncertainty of what's going on , who these people are , and how they relate to each other . But everything works out in the end and all the pieces fall into place . The girl's story is a tragic one . Her life is a series of miserable events ( a bad marriage , a miscarriage , a string of unfulfilling relationships , etc . ) all leading to her brutal murder . The girl is played by Dallia Di Lazzaro in a very memorable and believable performance . She gives her character a sense of depth not often found in Italian movies of this sort . She is easily the highlight of the movie for me .
366481	3109237	929560	6.0	A lot of fuss over a book	The problem with the episode numbering gets a bit ridiculous with " Terror on Ice Mountain " . IMDb lists it as Episode 12 when , in fact , it should be Episode 6 . Anyway , in this episode , Cornelius has found 2 , 000 year-old book written by humans about a trip to the zoo where apes are kept in cages . Fearing what would happen if Urko were to get wind of this discovery , Cornelius decides the best thing to do is hide the book . He goes to Jeff and Bill for help in building a hot air balloon to take the book to a mountain top hiding place . In route , Cornelius and Bill are blown off course and crash in the mountains . They are rescued by the wise mountain apes . Unfortunately , one of Urko's ski patrols has also spotted Cornelius and Bill and try to capture them . The mountain apes summon their god , a giant ape named Kygoor , to help Cornelius and Bill escape . The plot description may sound interesting , but " Terror on Ice Mountain " isn't nearly as good as it should have been . The problem ? padding . I would guess that half of the episode consists of poorly drawn scenes of a balloon flying , Cornelius and Bill walking through the snow , or gorillas skiing . The actual action ( and I hesitate to use the word " action " when describing anything in Return to the Planet of the Apes ) is limited to just a few minutes . The mountain apes are an interesting touch . Similar to Tibetan monks , they offer a new twist to the whole Planet of the Apes mythos . However , I'm not sure how Kygoor is supposed to fit into things . Ape history , as presented by Dr . Zaius , doesn't have room for a giant , primitive ape-god like Kygoor .
366876	3109237	929561	6.0	Oosa , Oosa , Oosa	I need to begin this by pointing out that the order of the episodes listed on IMDb does not match the order they appear on the DVD . IMDb lists them in the order they originally aired on television - even though the episodes aired out of order . Otherwise , the whole Return to the Planet of the Apes story arc gets all messed up . So , while IMDb lists the third episode as " Lagoon of Peril " , I'll be calling " The Unearthly Prophecy " the third episode . Clear ? Anyway , in " The Unearthly Prophecy " Jeff and Bill are on the run from the apes when they find an underground passage . It takes them to the Underdwellers ? a strange mutated race of humans . The Underdwellers have their lost comrade , Judy ( who Bill and Jeff have inexplicable not mentioned since she vanished half way through the first episode ) , and worship her as a God . Jeff and Bill are imprisoned but Judy comes to their rescue . They escape , but Judy must remain behind . " The Unearthly Prophecy " is easily the best , most creative episode so far . The underground race may be similar to the humans found in Beneath the Planet of the Apes , but there are enough differences to spice things up . For example , these mutants have the ability to shoot lasers with their eyes . Cool , huh ? It makes the escape that much more difficult . One thing I really found clever in " The Unearthly Prophecy " was the Underdwellers name for Judy ? Oosa . They took the letters U . S . A . and came up with the pronunciation Oosa .
366364	3109237	63330	6.0	The " dolls " certainly are creepy little buggers	I feel very fortunate to have seen the original Spanish version of Munecos infernales instead of the cut , poorly dubbed American film known as The Curse of the Doll People . If you go into Munecos infernales expecting great cinema , you'll probably come away disappointed . But , if you lower those expectations a bit and enjoy the film for what it is , you might just have fun with it . The plot concerns a group of men who have returned from a trip to Haiti . While there , they witnessed a voodoo ritual and managed to steal a voodoo idol . Before they could get away , however , the voodoo priest put a curse on the men and their families . Now , one by one , the men are dying mysterious deaths . The best part of Munecos infernales has to be the " dolls " . In reality , they're nothing more than midgets with paper-mâché masks that resemble their last victim . It may sound silly , but these are some creepy little buggers that actually manage to create a little atmosphere and sense of dread . On the downside , the film fells terribly padded to extend the runtime . For example , there are a couple of scenes where we see people going through windows that seem to go on forever . I previewed The Curse of the Doll People and , unfortunately , the cuts made to it don't include scenes like this .

It's nowhere near as good as Horror of Dracula , but it's a long way from being as bad as The Satanic Rites of Dracula . It's impossible to begin discussing any of Hammer's Dracula films without first mentioning Christopher Lee . In Scars of Dracula , Lee plays a more sadistic and evil version of the Count . In addition to the normal blood-sucking , this Dracula is not above the routine tortures of beating his servant with a whip , hanging a body from a wall , or sending his legions of bats to all but wipe out a town . It's these scenes that really make the film standout . But as much as I enjoyed the character of Dracula , as blasphemous as this will sound , it's one of Lee's weaker performances . Maybe I was reading something into his performance that wasn't there , but he came across as incredibly uninterested ( which in reality he was ) . There's none of the menace in the eyes that I associate with Lee's Dracula . It's acting by-the-numbers as far as I could tell . It's unfortunately because Lee was always so good in the role . Other highlights for me include Jenny Hanley as Sarah and the wall climbing scene . Hanley seemed like such a natural as the innocent , fragile Sarah . And she has some of the most expressive eyes I've noticed in a Hammer heroine . It's too bad she didn't make more films for Hammer . As for the wall climbing scenes , I believe it's the only one of its kind in any of the Hammer Dracula films . I realize that it's all done with camera tricks , but seeing Lee's Dracula climbing the side of the castle was a real treat . Unfortunately , I found just as many negatives as I did positives in Scars of Dracula . First , the screenplay has a number of holes in it . All of the characters make it incredibly convenient for Dracula . Not once is Dracula forced to leave his castle to find a victim ? they all conveniently come to him . And just how did Sarah get to the castle so fast ? The same journey that took Simon and a local priest almost an entire day is covered by the distraught Sarah in a matter of what seems to be a couple of hours . Next , Simon and Paul felt too modern given the time period in which the film is set . Their mannerisms , speech , and look simply scream 1970 . Finally , in the beginning of the film , Dracula is resurrected by a rubber bat drooling blood over his remains . If it's that easy for Dracula to come back to life , why didn't he use this method more often ? Why go through all the hassle of a séance as in Dracula A . D . 1972 or the elaborate ceremony in Taste the Blood of Dracula ? I seems like a lot of wasted effort to me .
366296	3109237	69904	6.0	Twice the Landau = Twice the Fun	As far as episodes of Columbo go , Double Shock is neither the best I've seen , nor is it the worst . It rests firmly in the middle . On the positive side , this episode presents a nice change-of-pace from the norm . In every other Columbo I've seen , not only do you know how the murder was committed , but you know beyond a shadow of a doubt who the killer is . Double Shock is a real mystery . It's not until the final reveal that crucial elements of the murder and the identity of the murderer are revealed . But , there are negatives . Far too much of Double Shock's runtime is made up of scenes that have nothing to do with advancing the plot . Columbo often goes off on tangents , but he does so to prove a point or discover something about a suspect . Not here . Scenes like those where Columbo argues with the housekeeper or where Columbo appears on a cooking show have nothing to do with the meat of the story . Columbo gains nothing making these scenes pointless .
365950	3109237	62477	6.0	Nice cast , but flawed movie	- The plot in Waterhole # 3 seems lifted straight from one of Leone's Spaghetti Westerns - a group of people search for stolen Army gold . Finding the gold doesn't prove to be too difficult . But hanging onto it certainly does . - Other than one major flaw , Waterhole # 3 is a reasonably entertaining comedy / Western that's sometimes very funny and sometimes . . . well . . . a Western . While the story may not be very originally , most of the cast does does an excellent job . James Coburn and Carroll O'Connor work well together . I've become quite the fan of Coburn and in Waterhole # 3 , he doesn't disappoint . Although he appears to basically be playing himself , he's entertaining enough to watch . In contrast , O'Connor has never been a favorite of mine , but his " bad " sheriff routine really works . - The one major flaw I mentioned , however , kept me from completely enjoying Waterhole # 3 and giving it a better rating . The flaw concerns the treatment of the sheriff's daughter who is basically raped by Coburn . I'm no prude , but there's just no place for this in a light-hearted comedy . And the fact that the her father , the sheriff , does nothing about it and even makes jokes with Coburn over what happened is out of place and out of line . A little sexual innuendo , a peck on the cheek , or Coburn making a pass at the daughter might have worked much better , but rape takes it way too far .
366833	3109237	81112	6.0	Lenzi Does Jonestown	Just as I did with Massacre in Dinosaur Valley , I've probably overrated Eaten Alive . I readily admit that it's not a very good movie . But it's so bizarre and so much fun that I can't help myself . If you throw in cannibals , a religious nut , bad dubbing , and Me Me Lai , you've got a sure fired winner as far as I'm concerned . It seems to me that Umberto Lenzi had an idea for making a film based on the Jim Jones story , but decided to spice it up by placing cannibals in the jungle . The Jonesesque aspects of the story are undeniable ? a cult , under the control of a ruthless leader , set-up a jungle compound to practice their strange form of religion . The followers are kept in line through the use of physical punishment and are threatened with death if they disobey . There's even a plan to distribute something similar to the poisonous Kool-Aid used in Guyana should the need arise for a mass suicide . Even the name Lenzi selected for his cult leader ? Jonas ? seems to have been done so to remind viewers of what happened in the Jungles of Guyana just a year or so earlier . While the Jim Jones story had been told before , Lenzi puts in a few of his own original twists and keeps it at least interesting . The cannibal scenes , on the other hand , lack any form of originality . It is all too obvious that most of these scenes were lifted from other cannibal films ? Lenzi's and other directors . For example , Me Me's death scene is the same one from Ruggero Deodato's Jungle Holocaust . I don't mean to imply that Lenzi shot a scene similar to Deodato's . That would have required effort . Instead , Lenzi included Deodato's footage from Jungle Holocaust in Eaten Alive . And this is not the only example . Besides originality , there's no continuity . Me Me's death scenes starts out in broad daylight but suddenly shifts to a night time as filmed in Jungle Holocaust . And the fact that the cannibals never look the same in any two scenes is a bit disconcerting . Finally , as with most of these Italian cannibal films , those who are squeamish about real animal deaths should avoid Eaten Alive . I'm certainly not a fan of these scenes either .
366169	3109237	131620	6.0	Disney Does Horror	Something happened 60 years ago at the Hollywood Tower Hotel ? something so bizarre and tragic that the doors were locked and the hotel closed . Five people stepped onto an elevator headed to the Tip Top Club on the 12th floor . Suddenly , a flash of green light and the elevator stopped . The five people on board the elevator were gone . They just vanished . Now , down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter Buzzy Crocker ( Steve Guttenberg ) has been given the chance to tell the story of a lifetime ? a chance to tell the world about what really happened to the people on board that doomed elevator . But to do so , he'll have to face the ghosts of the five souls that disappeared 60 years ago . I think that some of the criticism leveled against Tower of Terror is unfair and just plain ridiculous . For what it is ( a Disney horror movie ) , I quite enjoyed it . Sure , it doesn't have the same kind of scares or gore many horror fans look for , but it wasn't meant to . It was meant to be a movie aimed at families and children and , as such , I think it was reasonably successful . There are a couple of moments when the movie drags , but overall it's a well-paced , entertaining , harmless piece of entertainment . And , as much as it pains me , I must admit to enjoying the feel good ending . It worked for me . My biggest complaint would be the lack of originality . How many times have we seen this story played out ? A new twist on an old stand-by would have been nice . I suppose that another reason I enjoyed Tower of Terror might have something to do with the ride at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando . And what a ride it is ! A 12 story free-fall that's never the same ride twice ! I love it ! At the beginning of the movie , I was amazed at how much the hotel in the movie looked like the ride . It didn't come as too big of a surprise to me to learn that the exteriors were actually filmed in the park . How cool is that ?
366728	3109237	45679	7.0	You can all but feel the rocks pounding down as each Nazi shell hits .	The Desert Rats is a very enjoyable WWII film dealing with a portion of the war that may seem alien to those in America . Americans are accused , and sometimes rightly so , of thinking WWII began and ended with America's involvement . But it didn't . The Desert Rats is the story of the Allies last stand in Northern Africa at Tobruk . Rommel and the Nazis would have clear sailing to the important Suez if Tobruk fell . It's up to Capt . MacRoberts ( Richard Burton ) and his band of green Aussie replacements to stop the advance of Hitler's army . When you read comments about war movies , you always read complaints about historical accuracy . Is The Desert Rats true to history ? I'm not a student of history , so I wouldn't know . Furthermore , I don't really care . To me , it's about the entertainment I get from a film and I've always found The Desert Rats entertaining . The authentic looking sets , the tremendous ground shaking explosions , the plot that focuses on a small band of men , and the action sequences are all highlights of the movie for me . Robert Wise's direction and Lucien Ballard's cinematography put the viewer in the middle of the action . You can all but feel the rocks pounding down as each Nazi shell hits . It's very well done . My only complaint about The Desert Rats is in the overall construction . I realize that it's a result of attempting to be historically accurate , but history doesn't always put events in the most exciting sequences . The film opens with its best moments . The battle scene between the dug-in Aussie's and Rommel's tanks is as exciting and well filmed as I've seen in a war movie . Unfortunately , the movie ( as dictated by history ) cannot keep up this pace . The ending , as the now battle-hardened Aussie hold a hill waiting for replacements , is anticlimactic .
366094	3109237	152018	7.0	Massi and Merli team-up for a fun , action packed ride	If you're a fan of the Italian polizia thriller , the names Stelvio Massi and Maurizio Merli should be familiar . The pair , whether together or individually , are responsible for some of the best this genre has to offer . They teamed-up to make 1978's Convoy Busters and , for the most part , came up with a winner . The action is almost non-stop . It's a violent , sometimes bloody ride full of chase scenes and gun battles . And the pace rarely lets up . There are few directors who did action as well as Massi . He shows his mastery of action in several set-pieces in Convoy Busters with the chase scene involving the helicopter being among the best I've seen . The final slow-motion shoot out is a thing of beauty . As for Merli , when he's not busy posing for the camera ( which he has a tendency to do too often ) , he was a good action star . He's big and physical enough to effectively and believably pull of the role . And , unless I'm terribly mistaken , he did a lot of his own stunts . Watching Convoy Busters is like watching two movies in one . The plot is neatly split into halves with neither having much to do with the other . In the first half , Merli is a police officer stationed in Rome . He grows increasingly tired of the violence he faces on a daily basis . He's working on a case involving a well-connected smuggler . But because of bureaucracy and leaks within the police department , his quarry gets away . Frustrated with the experience , he asks for a transfer to a small sea side town where things are much quieter . Enter the second half of the movie . In his new environment , the most dangerous thing Merli faces is the boredom of a town where nothing seems to happen . That is until Merli uncovers a smuggling operation in his new quiet hometown . He's soon thrust back into the violence he sought to escape . But it's this plot structure that I found to be the weakest element in Convoy Busters . The first half of the movie ends with the bad guy boarding a plane and heading off to Geneva . Unfortunately , he's never mentioned again . This plot thread is never satisfactorily resolved . I would have liked it had Merli met up with him again at some point in the movie . After making an emotional investment of time , I expected a payoff .
366410	3109237	52655	7.0	" But if you'd have shot me , you'd be moppin ' up my blood now . "	A Bucket of Blood is a nice little Corman horror film . It plays better than many of his other non-Poe , non-Price films . It's the story of a " backwards " busboy in a beatnik dive trying to fit in by becoming an artist . His creations are the talk of the joint . But just how is the seemingly talentless busboy able to create such realistic images of death ? Dick Miller plays the busboy in one of the few feature roles I remember seeing him in . The mix of emotions he imbibes into his character is a highlight of the film . At one moment he's confused , the next a raving lunatic . Corman kept the screenplay simple and it works . I've seen too many low budget directors try to creative effects , etc . that their budgets just do not allow . Corman doesn't do this . This one is definitely recommended to fans of the 50s quickie horror films .
366747	3109237	54988	7.0	" If you do not leave this house in the next minute , I will kill you ! "	I'm very impressed with Homicidal . William Castle accomplishes more with the obviously small budget he had to work with in Homicidal that a lot of filmmakers could have with ten-times the money . Homicidal is Castle's rather obvious attempt to cash-in on the success of Psycho , released the year before . And , he's mostly successful . The surprising thing is that Castle is actually able to outdo Hitchcock in some areas . Take the opening as an example . I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first 15 minutes of Homicidal more than anything in Psycho . This may be surprising to some and downright blasphemous to others , but I'm just being honest . It's a quirky beginning with some very unexpected violence . The ending of the film is almost as good . Castle is actually able to build some nice tension in the film's finale . You know there's a killer in the house and you know who it is , but you also know what they're capable of and you're not sure when the killer will strike . Anyone who has seen more than three movies will have guessed the twist before it actually reveals itself , but that hardly matters . It's how the twist is pulled-off that's important . I couldn't do the film justice without saying hats off to Jean Arliss ( it's actually Joan Marshall ) for her work in Homicidal . She's completely over-the-top in her madness but never veers too far into camp . It's an excellent performance .
366067	3109237	295700	7.0	" We are never going into the woods again ! "	A group of six young people find themselves stranded in the mountains of West Virginia . When four members of the group leave to find either help or a phone they stumble upon a cabin that at first appears to be deserted . But what they find in the cabin proves that it is actually inhabited and not the place they want to be when the owners return home . Just as they are making their exit , a truck pulls to the front of the house and three inbred mountain men enter the house carrying the dead , butchered bodies of their friends with them . What Works : - Inbred Hillbillies . Movies with backwoods murderous inbred hillbillies have always fascinated me . Some of my favorite movies ( The Hills Have Eyes , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , The Final Terror , etc . ) feature this kind of character . These characters are frightening because you know they're based in reality . There really are people out there who look and , to a lesser extent , act like this . As a bonus , the make-up used on Three Finger , Saw-Tooth , and One-Eye is excellent . It's another argument in favor of traditional quality latex make-up . - No Jokes . Other than a few bits of comedy that fit within the framework of the plot , Wrong Turn is played straight . Most movies made today with this many horror clichés would turn into one big self-referential jokefest . I'm glad Schmidt avoided going down this road . There is no attempt to go out of the way to create comedy or fill the movie with inappropriate one-liners that only serve to ruin mood and atmosphere . - Scenes of Violence . I found many of the scenes of violence particularly well done . These inbred hillbillies are brutal and savage . They care not for human life . Their methods of killing are primitive but effective . One of my favorite scenes involves a bow , an arrow , and human eye . Nice ! What Doesn't Work : - It's Not West Virginia . My wife is from West Virginia and I've been there any number of times . I could tell almost immediately that the film wasn't actually made in West Virginia . I wasn't surprised to discover that the actual location was Ontario , Canada . If you're going to film a movie that is set in West Virginia , why not film it in West Virginia ? This just bugged me throughout the entire movie . - Why doesn't Eliza die ? With the exception of Eliza Dushku's character , every other victim the inbreeds run across is immediately slaughtered . So why did they ( or better yet , why does the script ) treat Eliza differently ? Why is she spared long enough to be rescued ? Obviously I know the answer , but it's an inconsistency in Wrong Turn that I didn't appreciate . Wrong Turn is a nice throwback to the 70s movies I grew up with . It's vicious , raw , brutal , and a lot of fun . In short , it's my kind of horror movie . Just thinking about the movie should make my family's annual October camping trip to West Virginia a more interesting .
366195	3109237	58405	7.0	Let's hear it for Hammer	I recently wrote a review of Hammer's Paranoiac and , for the most part , I feel like I could change the name and delete references to Oliver Reed and post it as an original review for Nightmare . Oh , sure , there are differences between the two when you start talking about specific plot points , but the general theme is the same . Like Paranoiac , Nightmare is the story of a young woman who is either going insane or being driven insane as part of a fiendish plot . The girl has visions of a woman roaming the halls of her house . When she follows the woman , she inevitably finds her lying on a bed with a knife stuck in her chest . If Nightmare excels at anything it's acting and atmosphere . The cast of non-Hammer regulars is wonderful . I've read that Jennie Linden was a last minute replacement to fill the role of the insane young woman . She's wonderfully believable in one of her first roles . I doubt that someone with considerable experience could have pulled it off so convincingly . As for atmosphere , I've always been of the belief that solid atmosphere is essential for an effective horror / thriller . And director Freddie Francis creates some very effective atmosphere . Everything from the sets to the cinematography to character reactions appears to have been designed to wring every last drop of atmosphere out of the script . I couldn't be happier with the recently released eight-movie Hammer Horror Series . While most fans will surely purchase the set for the better known Frankenstein , Dracula , and Werewolf movies , I hope that most are as pleasantly surprised by the lesser known B & W Hammer films as I am .
366562	3109237	837344	7.0	Baron Heinrich Von Freulich - What a name !	Engine trouble forces Race to set the Quest plane down on an unusual runway high in the Andean mountains . The runway belongs to the eccentric Baron Heinrich Von Freulich , a former WWI flying ace . He agrees to let Race borrow one of his vintage planes to get parts for the jet . However , Von Freulich has other plans . He intends to use Race as an opponent in one last dog fight . Shadow of the Condor is another very solid episode . Baron Heinrich Von Freulich makes for a wonderful foe for Team Quest . In fact , Von Freulich might just be the most interesting character to appear in Jonny Quest . From the moment he appears on screen , taking pot-shots at giant condors , you get a sense that this man is capable of most anything . Also , from the moment the Quest plane touches down , there's a sense of mystery and menace surrounding the castle high in the Andes that you usually don't find in a cartoon . And the ending - inspired and ironic are two words that come to mind . One thing I haven't mentioned yet in my comments on the Jonny Quest episodes is the subject of characters dying . In other cartoons , characters would get shot , burnt , and stabbed . They fell off buildings , got hit by cars , and had pianos fall on their heads . All that and they walk away as if nothing happened to them . That's not the case in Jonny Quest . Characters like Von Freulich crash a plane in the side of a mountain and they don't come back . I appreciate the realism . And I appreciate the fact that it taught me that there are consequences to actions . I don't ' think the character deaths in Jonny Quest scarred me as a kid and I've got no problem with my son watching them today . There's too much sheltering of children in the world today anyway .
366790	3109237	327084	7.0	After a few missteps , DreamWorks comes up with a winner	Having seen the abysmal products DreamWorks has put out recently ( Madagascar was bad and Shark Tale was unwatchable ) , I wasn't expecting much from Over the Hedge . I couldn't have been more wrong . Over the Hedge is an enjoyable story of a band of animals faced with the prospect of finding food as suburbia encroaches on their home . While there are a few slow spots , most of it is very well done . There are some segments that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny , none more so than a 2 minute scene near the end featuring the spastic , hyper Hammy . The script is well written , taking pokes at rampant consumerism and the need to preserve the environment without ever feeling preachy . The animation in Over the Hedge is top notch and the voice work is exceptional with Wanda Sykes being the standout to me . In short , my wife and I had a great time with it and our three year old stayed entertained throughout . What more can you ask ?
366430	3109237	74792	7.0	Unexpected surprises throughout	It took a while to grow on me , but by the time I had finished with Young , Violent , Dangerous , I realized how much I enjoyed the film . I found myself caring about the characters and what would become of them . Young , Violent , Dangerous is the story of three young punks out getting some kicks by knocking over a gas station . Their crimes soon escalate ( bank robbery , murder , kidnapping , etc . ) to the point where they get the attention of the entire Milan police force . The film is filled with some unexpected violence as the young thugs show just how tough they are and how little they care about human life . Throw in a few decent car chases and you've got a nice little Poliziotteschi . The ending is another unexpected moment with a nice twist . While Tomas Milian gets top billing , he really does very little other than smoke cigarettes , talk on a police radio , lecture people , and stay about three steps behind the young criminals . Eleonora Giorgi and Stefano Patrizi are the real stars as the kidnap victim and head of the gang respectively in a couple of very nice performances . The low point of the film is the character played by Benjamin Lev , Joe . He's supposed to be the clown of the group ( Why do all gangs have one of these guys ? ) but he comes off as an utterly ridiculous , hyena-laughing moron who I grew to detest more and more as Young , Violent , Dangerous wore on .
366429	3109237	84719	7.0	" Overall , it was a good , efficient butchery . "	There's not much need to go into detail on the plot . Simply put , The New York Ripper is the story of a mad killer with a penchant for slashing young woman and harassing the police with his duck-like voice . That's really all you need to know . The New York Ripper is Lucio Fulci's latter day ultra-violent take on the Giallo . When I say ultra-violent , I mean ULTRA-violent . If you're a fan of Fulci-style gore , there's surely something here for you . There's one scene where a girl's eye meets a razor that's particularly nasty and particularly difficult to watch . And , if you're a fan of Fulci-style sleaze , there's surely something here for you also . While I won't go as far as some reviewers and call it pornographic , there are a variety of sexual perversions on display . But it's not all blood and sex . Fulci actually manages to create a few scenes with real tension . There are moments where you know that killer is about to strike , but the anticipation Fulci builds in the audience is quite good . Unfortunately , there are problems I have with the film . I'll limit this to two examples . First , the resolution of the mystery is a real letdown . The killer's identity is far too easy to guess . Fulci telegraphs the answer form the opening moments of the film . Second , Gialli often ask the viewer to suspend reality to accept various plot points , but the final scenes in The New York Ripper cross the line into ridiculousness and really hurts the overall film . I'm certainly no expert , but I sincerely doubt that all the psychological babble made any real sense to anyone .
366365	3109237	366292	7.0	A restrained Miike	In Takashi Miike's One Missed Call , there's really very little new ground covered . If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned , long black-haired female ghost , I feel as if I've seen a dozen . Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around , I don't know ( or really care ) . The similarities , though , are undeniable . But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie . Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death . It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films , but for the most part , it works . Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer . One of the best examples is the " ghost in the cupboard " scene . It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare , but it's very effective in generating the desired response . Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital . These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films . Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not , as usual , it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films . One Missed Call is no exception . Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting , the film has a " look " that helps create an atmosphere of dread . The special effects , both visual and sound , are well done . The acting is good . Both of the leads , Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi , are more than adequate . And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension . Overall , it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect . But One Missed Call isn't without its faults . Beyond the " been there , done that " aspects of the plot , the film's pacing could have been better . While the first and third acts are enjoyable , the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit . Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film . A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better . One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved . For example , why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital ? And could the ending have been more confusing ? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale . That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it , but don't ask me what it all meant . Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues .
366472	3109237	67446	7.0	More plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings .	A jewel thief is brutally murdered on a train by a masked assailant . But when the murderer is unable to locate any diamonds , the murderer immediately suspects that the thief's daughter , a Parisian stripper named Nicole ( Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott ) , may have the diamonds . Nicole , however , claims to know nothing of the diamonds . After a series of threats , both verbal and physical , Nicole decides to flee France with a man she hardly knows . The pair begin a seemingly ideal relationship in a secluded seaside village . But Nicole is unaware that the killer has followed her to England and will stop at nothing to get his hands on the diamonds . What a fun Giallo ! Death Walks on High Heels has one of the most convoluted plots I've run into ? even by Giallo standards . While the movie may lack the quantity of murder scenes found in other Gialli ( although at least one murder scene is as violent as they come ) , Death Walks on High Heels makes up for this shortcoming with more plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings . It had me guessing ( incorrectly , I might add ) up to the very end . It's all about the mystery and director Luciano Ercoli skillfully casts the shadow of suspicion on just about everyone in the cast . Much of the movie is told quite nicely in flashbacks with bits and pieces of the story being revealed as each person confesses to what they may or may not have seen . There's even a pair of bumbling Scotland Yard detectives who are ( surprise , surprise ) actually funny . Overall , Death Walks on High Heels is very well done . The acting is a notch or two above what I've come to expect in a Giallo . The highlight , at least for me , is Nieves Navarro . She is amazing as Nicole . I didn't think I would ever say this , but I think she might have been capable of challenging Edwige Fenech in my mind as the Queen of the Giallo had she made a few more of these movies . I'm looking forward to checking out more of her work . As much as I enjoyed Death Walks on High Heels , it's not without its flaws . Chief among them , at least to me , is a " cheat " with respect to one of the murders . I don't want to give anything away , but there is one particularly nasty murder that the killer could not have committed given the circumstances immediately following the murder . Hopefully , with repeat viewings , I can reconcile this point in my mind and just enjoy the movie for what it is . Finally , and I'm really starting to sound like a shill , NoShame's new DVD is fantastic . I would have never dreamed that a movie like Death Walks on High Heels would look this good . Bravo NoShame !
365918	3109237	467432	7.0	David Suchet may be the definitive Poirot	I believe that I've always loved Agatha Christie's books . When I was younger , I can remember reading and re-reading each one , especially those with Hercule Poirot , over and over . I've probably read most of her books at least 3 times . So it only seems natural that I would be a fan of and enjoy movies adapted from Christie's mysteries . The big-budget Hollywood films like Death on the Nile and Murder on the Orient Express are among my favorite films . But for whatever reason , over the years , I have passed on most chances to watch Poirot with David Suchet on television . I had caught the odd episode here and there , but they were not a priority . I've decided to change that and give them a try . It's odd that I would start my journey through the series with The ABC Murders . Of all the Poirot novels , it's one of my least favorite . Most of the problems I have with the novel are the same as those I have with the movie . The biggest issue I have is the story's structure , including the final reveal . For my money , we as viewers ( and readers ) discover far too early the identity of A . B . C . We know who the man is , what he looks like , and what he's doing . And , while the film does bring all the characters together for Poirot to make the big reveal as to the murder's identity , for lack of a better description , it lacks some of that good old English drawing room feel that I really enjoy . It's almost an afterthought without the power usual found in Christie's endings . Getting past my petty quibbles with the story's structure , the movie is very nicely done . As much as I enjoy Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney in the role of the Belgian detective , David Suchet may be the definitive Poirot . He seems closer in my mind to fitting Christie's description of Poirot than anyone else I've seen . He's quite remarkable in the role . The rest of the acting is just as good , with A . B . C . himself , Donald Sumpter , giving a wonderful performance . The film's pace is snappy and the direction is solid . Considering what I assume to be a modest budget , the 1930s sets and costuming are dead-on perfect . The film has a wonderful look to it . Overall , the positive far outweigh the preconceived negatives I had in my mind making The ABC Murders quite an enjoyable experience . I'm looking forward to visiting the other episodes in the series . If the other films in the series are this entertaining as The ABC Murders , I'm in for a real treat .
366449	3109237	27545	7.0	I'll take the Daughter over the Daddy	To be honest , I've never been the biggest fan of the original Dracula . To me , Dracula never held the excitement of some of the other Universal classics . It always seemed too " stagey " for my liking . That's not the case with Dracula's Daughter . Gloria Holden is mesmerizing as Dracula's daughter , Countess Marya Zaleska . Her attitude , look , and performance are what one would expect from a vampire . She plays a vampire in a similar manner to the way Lon Chaney , Jr . played a wolf man - as a tormented soul , longing to be free from a curse . You can almost hear Larry Talbot asking to be released from his nightmare . The rest of the cast is also quite good . Edward Van Sloan is back as Von Helsing . Irving Pichel is especially creepy as the Countess ' henchman Sandor . Marguerite Churchill is a real cutey playing the female in trouble . The weakest cast member is the hero played by Otto Kruger . His character is too unsympathetic to be effective . The atmosphere is just right . From the fog shrouded London streets to the castle in Transylvania , the perfect horror atmosphere is achieved . The story is simple and straight forward . I would , perhaps , have preferred a few more twists along the way . I'll take Dracula's offspring ( either son or daughter ) any day to the original .
366048	3109237	40613	7.0	" You've been taken to the cleaners , and you don't even know your pants are off . "	- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City , Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) finds a property in the country for his wife and children . He's hoping to find the simple life . But , building a house proves to be anything but simple . As the headaches and the bills start piling up , so do the laughs . Will Mr . Blanding's ever get his dream house ? - What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas . Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own , so when you combine their talents , almost every scene is special . Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role . He is so good at playing the put upon husband . Loy is a always a joy to watch . The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect . And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years . Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House , a particular favorite of mine . - The movie is definitely a product of its time . I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story , three bedroom , four bathroom house on $15 , 000 income a year . Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful . - However , for anyone who has bought or built a house , many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today . And that's where the comedy comes in . How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected ? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr . Blandings is the whole " wife in love with best friend " subplot . It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented .
366019	3109237	323630	7.0	Nice supernatural murder mystery	Shortly after popping Phone in the DVD player , my thoughts were , " Oh no . Not another Asian long-haired ghost story " . I thought it was going to be the same old thing . Since watching , I've read reviews on the internet that complain about the movie being " derivative " or " unoriginal " ( if you want to see derivative and unoriginal , check out Ju-rei ) . And while I agree to a certain extent , Phone has enough twists and turns in the plot to keep it from being just another " ghost with long hair " story . I see it as a murder mystery with supernatural elements . I'll admit that the mystery had me guessing up to the big reveal and the supernatural stuff had me jumping on more than one occasion . While it's certainly not the best Asian horror movie I've ever seen , I was reasonably entertained after a slow start . If the current crop of Asian horror has one thing in common , most all of the ones I've seen are technically brilliant . Phone is no exception . The house where most of the story takes place is visually stunning with a load of atmosphere ? a real feat in a modern setting . Sound , lighting , locations , special effects , etc . are all what I've come to expect when watching one of these movies . One area where Phone does not measure up to its Asian brethren is in the acting department . It's not that the performances are bad , but with one exception , no one really stands out . The performances are " workmanlike " at best . The exception is See-woo Eun who plays the little girl , Yeong-ju . And while most of her acting consists of a series of strange faces and growls at the camera , considering her apparent age , it's a solid and memorable performance . Given the subject matter and some of the things she was asked to do , I was impressed .
366061	3109237	72869	7.0	Borgnine the Goat	The plot of The Devil's Rain is very simple . It concerns the Preston family and a book their ancestors stole decades ago from a devil worshiper named Jonathan Corbis ( Ernest Borgnine ) . Corbis has spent centuries trying to locate the book and will stop at nothing to obtain it and use its power . What Works : - What a Cast ! The Devil's Rain is the Airport ( or at least The Love Boat ) of horror movies . Just take a look at the cast ? Ernest Borgnine , Tom Skerritt , Eddie Albert , Ida Lupino , William Shatner , Keenan Wynn , and , although very brief , John Travolta . I'm amazed that the producers could get all of these people to appear in what is essentially a low budget horror film . - Borgnine the Goat . This is where a lot of people seem to have problems with The Devil's Rain . They seem to find the sight of Borgnine with goat horns too funny to take seriously . I look at it just the opposite . I've always found it a disturbing , well-done visage . The whole idea that someone could literally transform into a demon is frightening to me . And the make-up is very nicely done . I've seen a lot of big budget films that didn't have special effects half as convincing as what's found here . - Melting Bodies . Another special effects moment that is a winner as far as I'm concerned . Sure , the bodies look like they are spewing forth melted orange and lime sherbet , but I still find it effective . I've seen any number of melting body scenes over the years , but the ones in The Devil's Rain are among my favorite . What Doesn't Work : - Did I Miss Something ? The movie gives no introduction as to what is taking place at the beginning of the movie . The viewer is literally dropped into a scene with people and actions that are a mystery . It's almost like the first half of the movie is missing . - Silly Story . If you try to think too hard about what's going on with the plot , it can make your head hurt . My suggestion is to just enjoy the cheese and forget about trying to make sense of it all . Don't over-analyze it , just go with the flow . In the end , I realize that The Devil's Rain really isn't that good of a movie , but it's just so much cheesy fun that I can't help but rate it as high as I do . It's a movie that could have only been made in the 70s . It seems to me that anyone with a half-baked idea and enough money could see their vision on the big screen . Many of today's horror movies are so glossy and over-produced that all the fun has been sucked out of them . And , for me , much of the appeal of horror movies is having fun .
366778	3109237	580383	7.0	Nice beginning to the series	I have a 5 year-old son who just loves anything to do with animals . The other day we were out shopping and ran across Season 1 of Flipper . I remembered watching it as a child and enjoying the show , so I thought I might take a chance on it and buy it for my son . And at less than $15 , I really wasn't risking a whole lot . To my utter delight , my little boy just loves it . So far , my son's favorite episode is " 300 Feet Below " . The plot involves a man who radios for help after being attacked by a shark . Badly needed plasma is delivered to the boat by helicopter , but it's accidentally dropped into the ocean . When Ranger Porter Ricks dives in to get the plasma , he runs into the same shark . Fortunately , Flipper is on hand to battle the shark and save the day . For me , I was surprised at how much real tension and suspense I got out of this episode . I was also surprised to see actual blood in a family television show from 1964 . I didn't know you could do that back then . For my son , he talks almost every day about the Flipper vs . shark showdown and goes on to describe blow-by-blow how it all unfolded . He's hooked . And I'm thinking that's not a bad thing . With the state of television today , you could do a whole lot worse than Flipper .
366251	3109237	68183	8.0	Violent , trashy , exploitive , and a helluva lot of fun !	That sure was fun ! Ricco ( or The Mean Machine or whatever you want to call it ) may not be the best , most dramatic , or grittiest Euro-crime film I've run across , but it is one of the most entertaining I've ever seen . Ricco ( Christopher Mitchum ) is a young man out for revenge . He's just finished serving a two year prison sentence for attacking the man he holds responsible for killing his father and assuming control of his criminal organization . And now that he's been released , Ricco discovers that Don Vito ( Arthur Kennedy ) has also taken his girl . Let's get this out of the way up-front ? Ricco has its fair share of obvious weaknesses and problems . Chief among them is Mitchum . He may look a lot like his father , but that's where the comparison ends . I'm guessing he was going for introspective and brooding , but unfortunately Mitchum comes off as vacant and robotic . His fight scenes are often hysterical . Watching him go through his kung-fu moves , I can just imagine the director off-screen giving him step-by-step instructions . I've never seen someone move so unnaturally . But I've always said that I rate movies based on entertainment value and Ricco provides a good test of that statement . Looking past Mitchum's shortcomings , Ricco is wildly entertaining . It's a trashy good time . The movie has a feel to it that I found unique for this kind of movie . It never seems to be taking itself too seriously . I may be way off on this one , but to me it's as if the director , Tulio Demicheli , realized how absurd some of the situations were and just let everyone have fun with it . The plot is actually little more than the standard revenge theme , but it held my interest throughout . There's hardly ever a dull moment . Ricco has the violence I've come to expect from this kind of movie ? including one particularly nasty scene that makes something like the cut-off ear in Django look like child's play . The supporting cast is top notch . Arthur Kennedy makes for a wonderfully slimy villain , complete with a ridiculous looking mustache . Ricco's old flame is played by the insanely gorgeous Malisa Longo . And genre favorite Barbara Bouchet's surreal stripper routine in the middle of the road is another of the film's highlights . What more could you ask for ?
366879	3109237	143145	8.0	" There's no point living , if you can't feel alive . "	From the time he took over the role of James Bond , I've tended to dismiss the Pierce Brosnan era as one of the weaker periods of the franchise . That assessment was cemented with Brosnan's last outing as Bond in Die Another Day ? quite possibly the very worst of the 21 official Bond movies . But something odd keeps happening . I keep going back to The World is Not Enough . I've actually probably seen it more times in the past 5 years than any other Bond film . I realize now that it's not only Brosnan's best effort in the series , but also it's one of my five or six favorite Bond movies . In The World is Not Enough , Bond is sent to the Caspian Sea to protect an oil heiress , Elektra King ( Sophie Marceau ) , after her father is killed in an explosion at MI-6 Headquarters . King's is in a race with three other groups to be the first to complete an oil pipeline to bring their product to market . And someone seems intent on making sure Elektra doesn't win the race . Bond discovers that a terrorist named Renard ( Robert Carlyle ) may be responsible for the father's death , the threats against Elektra and the pipeline , and the theft of enough plutonium to destroy a good chunk of Turkey . But Bond also discovers that things may not be as they seem . Is Elektra really as innocent as she seems ? Or is she , as unthinkable as it may be , in league with Renard ? There are a lot of things about The World is Not Enough that keep me coming back . The most obvious is the plot . It definitely has a darker , more realistic tone to it than one normally associates with a James Bond film . It has more in common with To Russia with Love than it does the quip-filled gimmicky Bond movies of Roger Moore . And Brosnan does a more than competent job playing Bond with the same sort dark tone . The World is Not Enough actually shows Bond killing in cold blood . Don't get the wrong impression ? there is still humor to be found in the film , but it's used very judiciously . Speaking of realism , other than the whole bullet in the brain making him impervious to pain , Robert Carlyle's Renard is a much more frightening advisory than the cartoonish villains with their ridiculous plans to take over the world . Renard could almost be a real-world terrorist . I also appreciate the increased role for Judy Dench as M in The World is Not Enough . It's good to see M out from behind her desk and in the field . But the real highlight of the film for me is Sophie Marceau as Elektra King . Not only does Marceau prove herself to be a talented actress , but the writers actually gave her something to work with . Too often in the Bond movies of the past , woman who start out as Bond's enemies find themselves swooning after a single encounter . Not Elektra . She remains defiant till the end . In fact , Elektra turns the tables on Bond . She uses Bond the way he normally uses women . And in this instance , Bond's the one doing the swooning . Elektra may not be the normal , run of the mill Bond girl , but I for one am glad of that . As for the negatives found in The World is Not Enough , I'm going to beat the same dead horse found in most other comments and point to Denise Richards . In a word , she's terrible . Her entire career is based on her looks because she certainly can't act . I cannot remember a single actor in any Bond movie ( and that includes the likes of Tonya Roberts ) who was so ill-suited to play their part . Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist ? yeah , right . Five years ago I rated The World is Not Enough a . The rating , however , seems to go up with each successive viewing . I'm at an now . Who knows what will happen the next time I watch this movie .
366891	3109237	32484	8.0	" I'm in love with a girl , and I'm going to help hang her father . "	Several weeks ago , I decided to give some of the older , less well known Hitchcock films a try . So far , this has been mostly a pleasant experience and has introduced me to several new favorites . Foreign Correspondent may not be the best of the early Hitchcock offerings I've watched recently , but it's still a very solid film . It's the story of a reporter from New York sent to cover the events as Europe stands on the threshold of war . He's soon mixed up in a plot to kidnap the one man who may be able to put a stop to things . But who can he trust ? It doesn't help matters that the woman he has fallen in love with seems to be at the center of his investigation . The biggest flaw in Foreign Correspondent that I see is the length of time it takes to really get into things . The opening scenes are nicely shot , but they're not that interesting . It takes a while for the movie to grab you and pull you in . But once things start happening , it's non-stop action and intrigue . Foreign Correspondent rarely pauses for you to take a breath . Before you know it , you're on to the next scene of increasing suspense . While it's fairly easy to spot the man behind the plot to start war , it's interesting to watch the way Hitchcock allows the events to unfold . Characters do not jump to wild conclusions but work toward them gathering evidence along the way . It's a nice job of storytelling . Joel McCrea is billed as the film's star . And while he's okay , I doubt very sincerely that he would have been able to pull off a film like Foreign Correspondent without a superb supporting cast . I've made no secret about enjoying George Sanders in just about every role I've ever seen him in . He's as good in Foreign Correspondent as ever . The man makes every scene he's in better . The rest of the cast is just as solid with Herbert Marshall being another standout . It's been a joy to discover these films for the first time . If movies like Foreign Correspondent are any indication of things to come , I'm looking forward to continuing my journey through Hitchcock's filmography . Next up : The Lady Vanishes .
365936	3109237	80661	8.0	An incredible thrill ride	What do you get if you mix equal parts Alfred Hitchcock with Dario Argento ? Answer : Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill . I suppose you could categorize Dressed to Kill as an American giallo . This is one of those movies that would be difficult to discuss the plot without ruining a good portion of the movie , so I won't even try . If you really must know more about the plot , read it here : http www imdb com title tt0080661 I had not seen Dressed to Kill in about 20 years . I had completely forgotten what an effective movie it is . Several particular moments stand out . The first is the art gallery scene . It's basically a long drawn-out game of cat and mouse . Angie Dickinson is at first pursued and later pursues an unknown man . The way De Palma takes the camera around the twists and turns inside the gallery with only the briefest of glimpses of the mystery man is very effective at building tension . It is amazing that he is able to build this tension and then just let it go without the expected payoff . - The second scene that I find particularly well done is the famous elevator scene . Unlike the art gallery , there is very little in the way of build up . An elevator door opens and . . . well you know what happens . The brutality on display in this scene rivals that of the best Italian giallo . The elevator scene was heavily " influenced " by Hitchcock's Psycho . And , the Hitchcock " influence " goes beyond the actual murder . It includes the whole idea of killing off your " star " within the first third of the movie . It must have taken real guts to tell the studio that now that you've hired Angie Dickinson as the star , you're killing her off before the movie is half over . - The third scene that I'll discuss ( or not discuss ) is the finale in the doctor's office . As I stated at the beginning , I don't want to give away too much of the movie . It is all but impossible to discuss this particular scene without doing just that . I'll just say that it's a joy to watch as De Palma plays tricks on the viewer . Not cheap tricks , but tricks that fit within the story . - The only real negatives to the movie are the scenes that take place immediately after the doctor's office finale . The need to explain everything in the finest detail is not necessary . Any viewer with an IQ of the average houseplant already knows what happened . These scenes just feel tacked on and hurt the overall flow of the movie .
366130	3109237	37794	8.0	" Once a man has dipped his fingers in blood , sooner or later he'll feel the urge to kill again . "	As Sherlock Holmes ' puts it , the members of group of older gentlemen known as The Good Comrades have only one thing in common ? they're all worth more dead than alive . One by one , the members of The Good Comrades are bumped-off in horrifying ways after receiving an envelope containing orange pips ( seeds to us Yanks ) . Holmes discovers that the members of the group have made each other beneficiaries on their insurance policies . Could one of The Good Comrades be behind the string of mysterious deaths ? It sure looks to be the case . The House of Fear is near the top of my favorites list when it comes to the Rathbone / Holmes films . It's a wonderfully entertaining mystery with a nice old dark house for a setting . My favorite of the Holmes films are those with a touch of horror . When you combine horror and mystery successfully as in The House of Fear , you've got a winner as far as I'm concerned . I've seen comments on the internet on how easy it is to figure this one out . Sure , but it's a lot of fun watching Holmes and Watson get to the answer . As I'm learning as I watch these Holmes films , Watson again is given the opportunity to steal some quality time from Holmes . His late night shoot-out is wonderfully funny . Roy William Neil is probably one of the best things that happened to Universal's Holmes series . His entries in the series have a tone and look to them that makes them stand out . For what ever reason , I hardly ever see him mentioned when people discuss the great directors of the 30s and 40s . He's easily someone I consider under-appreciated .
366283	3109237	64916	8.0	This ain't your grandfather's Western	The plot of Sabata sees the title character ( played by Lee Van Cleef ) stopping a bank robbery only to blackmail those responsible . The robbery ringleaders don't see too kindly to this and look to take out our hero and the rest of his ragtag bunch . Sabata has everything I look for in a Spaghetti Western - good gun fights , over-the-top violence , quirky characters , some nifty acrobatics , a plot that stretches credibility , and a strong anti-hero . Another thing Sabata has going for it is a sense of humor . The entire movie is done with the tongue planted firmly in cheek . If you take none of it very seriously , it's a lot of fun . Just remember - this ain't your grandfather's Western . Other than the better known Sergio Leone films , this may be the best Spaghetti Western Lee Van Cleef made . He's almost perfect as the killer with nerves of steel capable of hitting a target at the most ridiculous of distances . He seems to always be at least two or three steps ahead of his adversaries . The supporting cast is just as good with William Berger and , in particular , Ignazio Spalla ( aka Pedro Sanchez ) giving nice performances . Spalla is one of the highlights for me of all the Sabata films . Another thing I really enjoy about Sabata is the music . It's one of the better , more-catchy non-Morricone scores I've heard . I don't care how many times I've seen the movie , I always get that theme music stuck in my head . It's a silly tune , but it works for me .
366213	3109237	71517	8.0	Pam Grier is Amazing	- Foxy Brown is a great example of the Blaxplotation films made in the 1970s . It's a product of its time and ( even though a remake is in the works ) could not be made today . The PC crowd would go nuts if such a movie were released in 2005 . - Foxy Brown is the story of a woman looking for revenge after her boyfriend is gunned down in front of her house . She's not going to let anyone , not even her brother , stand in the way of her mission . - Foxy Brown works primarily because of two key ingredients - Pam Grier and Jack Hill . After watching just a few minutes , it's easy to forget that your watching Grier and , instead , think you are really watching Foxy . Grier is perfect as Foxy . I honestly can't imagine anyone else in the role . She's one of those smart , tough , caring , and honest characters that you don't often , unfortunately , see being played by a black woman . She is the ultimate in her own butt-kicking , outfit-changing , pulling-a gun-from-her-afro kind of way . - As for Jack Hill , he was able to make a movie on a very tight , limited budget that looks much larger than it really is . There are a few instances where you would have liked to see Hill do a re-shoot , but for the most part , the movie's flaws are not obvious .
366071	3109237	443706	8.0	" Before I kill you , I'm going to throw your baby out the window . "	Almost 40 years ago , the San Francisco area was terrorized by a crazed killer known only as Zodiac . He committed what seems to have been a series of cold-blooded , but random murders . He would follow-up the killings with letters sent to the police and newspapers that taunted them with clues and cryptograms that promised to reveal his identity . He claims to have killed a dozen or so people . But after years of activity , the Zodiac disappeared . Though some feel they know Zodiac's true identity , the case has never been officially solved . David Fincher's movie Zodiac is the story of this famous but dark period of American history and presents on possible solution to the mystery of the Zodiac . Having recently done some reading on the Zodiac killer , I decided it was high time I checked out Fincher's movie . I was well aware of some of Fincher's other work but I hadn't read much about Zodiac , so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect . Also , given the quality of some of the other movies made about real life serial killers , I tried not to get my hopes up too high . Overall , I'm very impressed . Zodiac is an intelligent , thrilling , well-written piece of cinema with some very good performances . If you're looking for a thrill-a-minute ride , you'll be disappointed . While some of the Zodiac's murders are shown in detail , they are not the focus of the movie . Instead , the investigation by the police and the reporters is central to Zodiac's plot . In a comment on IMDb , I read the comparison between Zodiac and All the President's Men and couldn't agree more . The obsession of Woodward and Bernstein to get to the bottom of Watergate is very similar to that of Robert Graysmith as he hunts for the elusive killer . Some may call it slow or even dull , but having an attention span longer than 30 seconds , I found it very exciting . While I've done a little research on the Zodiac case , I'm far from an expert . But from what little I do know , I appreciate how well the movie sticks with the facts of the case . I'm sure those more well versed in the subject would be more qualified to respond to this , but I noted very few instances of creative liberties being taken with the material . And most of those instances seem to come from Graysmith's novel and were not made by those responsible for the movie . And I'm impressed with the way Fincher was able to take these known facts and create such an entertaining movie . Even though I knew the outcome and what was going to happen next , Fincher puts so much style and atmosphere into the movie that it's predictability with me hardly mattered . I was literally on the edge of my seat . It's a well directed movie . Finally , I cannot end this without singling out some the acting as a real bright spot of Zodiac . Jake Gyllenhaal , Robert Downey , Jr . , Anthony Edwards , and everyone else involved did a wonderful job . In fact , I cannot think of a single actor that I didn't enjoy . But as good as every performer was , I was most impressed with Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi . I bought his character completely . It's quite simply a brilliant performance .
366774	3109237	58155	8.0	A wonderfully unique Hammer offering	I simply do not understand why The Gorgon ( like a lot of the other lesser known Hammer movies ) isn't available on a legitimate Region 1 DVD . It's ridiculous . Admittedly , The Gorgon is an unusual horror movie . The story of a mythical creature able to turn men to stone with just her gaze is not your normal horror fare . And the movie isn't full of marketable blood and jump scares . Instead , The Gorgon is a slow paced , atmospheric chiller that I find terribly entertaining and one of the more unique movies Hammer ever made . The Gorgon has so much going for it that I can't imagine it not being a favorite of any Hammer fan . To begin with , there's always something special about watching Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing working together . Even though their shared screen-time is limited , it's still a treat . The rest of the acting is quite good , especially the conflicted and beautiful Carla played by Barbara Shelley . Shelley really doesn't get near enough credit for her performance in this movie . Beyond the acting , The Gorgon is a movie filled with terrific atmosphere thanks to John Gilling's screenplay and Terence Fisher's direction . There's a real sense of unease running through the movie . The music further adds to the atmosphere . Megara's eerie but beautiful call is memorable long after the movie is over . There's just something mesmerizing about it . The lighting , sets , and cinematography are all some of the best you'll find in a Hammer production . The movie looks far better than you would expect . Finally , even though the special effects seem to always be a focal point of criticism , I quite enjoy the Gorgon's look . What some call cheap and tacky looking , I call fun . It's always a blast for me when Megara makes her entrance . In fact , I've got more of a problem with Christopher Lee's sad looking make-up than I do with the Gorgon's appearance .
366575	3109237	90477	8.0	" Comfortable " Television	I am so excited that Lovejoy has finally come to DVD . I used to love the show , but hadn't seen an episode since the A & E network stopped running it some years ago . So as I put the first DVD in the player , I was ready for a huge letdown . But to my surprise and delight , the show is just as good as I remember ? a good mix of mystery , action , and comedy with some interesting , fun characters and just a dash of history . Lovejoy is old-world British charm meets modern day realities and cynicism . Watching Lovejoy is akin to wearing an old pair of shoes or a favorite sweater ? it's comfortable . It's always been the kind of television that works best when I curl up on the couch late at night . And making the show so special and enjoyable is Ian McShane . I've yet to see him in Deadwood , so I am most familiar with McShane in this role . And what a pleasure to watch he is . He makes Lovejoy a carefree , smart , sly , resourceful character not above doing something underhanded especially if it will help out a friend . He's the kind of guy you want on your side . He is ably assisted by a terrific supporting cast that includes Dudley Sutton as Tinker Dill , Chris Jury as Eric Catchpole , and Phyllis Logan as Lady Jane Felsham . Together , they're wonderful . While the easygoing style and subject matter of Lovejoy may not appeal to those wanting a thrill-a-minute and MTV style editing , it suits me perfectly . I can't wait for Season 2 !
366044	3109237	64505	8.0	So very British	- Charlie Croker ( Michael Caine ) has been out of prison for less than five minutes when he begins planning his next heist . This one involves robbing an armored car filled with gold in the streets of Turin , Italy . But , it's not just the police that Croker and Crew must contend with . The Mafia doesn't want some outsider to come into their country and steal gold out from under their noses either . The job becomes similar to the football match the Crew uses as a cover - it's about national pride . - It's amazing that I had never seen this movie before . I understand that in Britain , it's considered nothing short of a national treasure . After watching , I can certainly see why . Everything about The Italian Job just screams Britannia - the Minis , the song with lyrics that are indecipherable to most Americans , Michael Caine , sensibilities , etc . I don't think that the colors selected for the Minis was an accident . About half way through , I felt like stopping the movie to make tea . - The actual theft of the gold is fairly unremarkable . But the chase afterwards is where a lot of the fun in this movies lays . The Minis are characters in their own right . The final third of the movie is the most amazing commercial for an automobile I've ever seen . We see the Minis go down stairs , jump through the air , race across the roofs of buildings , splash through water , swoosh through tunnels , and ( if you watch the deleted scenes on the Region 1 DVD ) waltz on ice . Sometimes these extended car chase scenes can go on too long for their own good . Not here . I was never bored of watching the Minis race around Turin . - I loved the ending . It is left wide open for you , the viewer , to decide just what happens next . Too many newer movies seem to feel the need to explain everything in the most minute detail . It's nice to use your imagination for a change . - Finally , the music is another highlight of the movie . It seems a little odd that a movie I have described being very British should have the very American Quincy Jones responsible for the score . I defy anyone to watch The Italian Job and not have Getta Bloomin ' Move On ! stuck in your head for days .
366373	3109237	75291	8.0	A gem I'm glad to have discovered	Luca is Martino's imaginary friend . Martino talks to Luca , plays with Luca , and insists the family set a place at the table for Luca . Martino's obsession with Luca seems unhealthy and troubling to his parents . Luca happens to be the name they were planning to give to their child who died before being born . How could Martino possibly know about the miscarriage ? The parents call on specialists to help Martino forget about his imaginary friend with disastrous results . Maybe Luca isn't so imaginary after all . A Whisper in the Dark is one of those relatively unknown , subtle , beautifully filmed , and , for the most part , well acted films with a haunting finale that it's always a joy for me to discover . Unknown ? I don't think I had ever heard of it until NoShame announced their DVD release . Subtle ? Don't expect a lot of in-your-face horror . This movie takes its time delivering the chills . Those who have seen the film will understand it when I use the " kissing game " as a perfect example of subtle , yet effective horror . Beautifully filmed ? The Venetian locations are simply stunning . Well acted ? With two notable exceptions , the acting in A Whisper in the Dark is very good . Normally , children and horror do not mix very well . The kids in this movie are perfect without being too cute or too annoying . Most of the rest of the cast is fine with Nathalie Delon being the standout as the children's mother . Haunting finale ? The movie has one of those ambiguous endings that I just love wrapping my mind around . My biggest complaint comes from the performances of two of the movies main actors ? Joseph Cotten and John Phillip Law . Why is Cotten even in this movie ? He seems so out of place even with the little screen time he has . Normally , I enjoy his work , but not here . As for Law , I've read other reviews of people praising his work in A Whisper in the Dark . Apparently , they saw something I completely missed . I thought he was terrible . Finally , a word about NoShames DVD . I've come to expect nothing but the best from NoShame and their treatment of A Whisper in the Dark does not disappoint . The transfer looks great . The special features , although modest , are also nice . It's definitely worth a purchase for fans of Italian horror .
366344	3109237	56062	8.0	" I drink to you , and to the American Army . "	Hell is for Heroes is the story of a squad of six men who have been asked to hold a line usually occupied by an entire company . It's as gritty and realistic as you'll find in an older black and white WWII movie . It's not filled with sentimentality or overly patriotic speeches or soldiers on leave and in love . It's about combat and action . It's claustrophobic , dirty , and frightening . The men in this movie are only concerned with one thing ? getting out alive . Steve McQueen is terrific as the flawed but hard-nosed solider more at home on the front line killing Nazis than he is any place else . He doesn't speak much , but McQueen expresses more with those eyes than most actors could with a page of dialogue . But Hell is for Heroes is much more than a vehicle for McQueen . He is surrounded by a very able cast . James Coburn ( one of my favorites ) , Bobby Darin , Mike Kellin , and the rest of the cast turn in some outstanding performances . And Bob Newhart shines as the film's comic relief . His shtick is hilarious . Newhart literally steals every scene in which he appears . As good as the action in Hell is for Heroes is , it's these " men " that make the film memorable and outstanding for me . My lone complaint comes near the end of Hell is for Heroes . As McQueen makes the second effort to blow-up the German bunker , why don't the Germans fire at him ? I mean they've mowed down everything else in front of them . So why do the Nazis allow this shot-up , dying G . I . the chance to stagger up to their position , pick up the unexploded charge , and fall into their bunker ? It just doesn't make much sense to me .
366062	3109237	54099	8.0	The definition of atmosphere	Mill of the Stone Women is the story of a researcher named Hans who is finishing a book on the famous sculptor Professor Wahl and his carousel . The carousel features wax representations of women being tortured and killed in a variety of sadistic and inventive ways . A meeting with the Professor's beautiful , seductive daughter , Elfi , ignites conflicting passions within Hans because of his one true love Liselotte . Things are even more complicated because breaking the news to Elfi will not be easy . She suffers from a rare disease that can cause death if she becomes too upset or disturbed . In addition , Hans is convinced that Professor Wahl is up to some twisted experiments that may involve several of the local women including his Liselotte . Hans must solve the mystery of the windmill and the carousel if he is to save himself and the one woman he cares about . What Works : - Atmosphere , Atmosphere , Atmosphere . If you're into atmosphere with your horror , look no further than Mill of the Stone Women . Most movies can't claim to have of the atmosphere found here . The barren landscape , the isolated windmill , the constant overcast skies , the dark corridors with secret rooms in the windmill , the eerie music , the twisted carousel of death , and the Gothic trappings everywhere you look all add to a movie that just drips with atmosphere . The movie takes it's time and doesn't rush or try to force things . There's a real foreboding sense of unease that runs throughout the movie . There are moments when you might think the atmosphere is going to literally ooze from the screen into your living room . - Scilla Gabel . Gabel is one of those women of the 60s that I don't think exist anymore . She's from that Sophia Loren - Claudia Cardinale ? Daliah Lavi mold of women that were a product of that time . She may never be confused with a great actress , but she has a screen presence that's hard to beat . - Prof . Gregorius Wahl . What a character ! Robert Boehme does an excellent job of playing a mad , but goofy , genius . By the end of Mill of the Stone Women , though , it's easy to feel some sympathy for him as his dreams are shattered . It's an excellent piece of acting from a man whose acting credits only include this movie . - Wooden Shoes . Any movie with people wearing wooden shoes has to get a bonus point from me . What Doesn't Work : - Slow Going . For me , this is a plus . But I put it here to warn those who prefer a movie with a killing or explosion every five minutes . - Love Story . Because Hans represents a new , exciting life , it's easy to see why Elfi might quickly fall for him . And , because Elfi is such a looker , it's easy to see why Hans might be interested in Elfi . But the fact that both are declaring their undying love for each other after one five-minute meeting stretches the imagination quite a bit . In the end , Mill of the Stone Women is one of the finest examples of a Gothic , atmospheric movie ever made . The film plays like a combination of The House of Wax meets Eyes Without a Face . It's a wonderful movie that I enjoy more each time I get the chance to watch .
366550	3109237	235198	9.0	A Masterpiece	- Every once in a great while , you stumble upon a movie that you immediately know is a masterpiece . I had read what other people had written about Audition , but didn't really believe all the hype . Surely it couldn't be as good as people claimed . After seeing Audition for the first time , I simply cannot get the film out of my mind . I doubt I can come up with enough glowing adjectives to describe the movie - disturbing , fascinating , brutal , engrossing , etc . It is quite simply on of the best movies I've ever seen . Fortunately , I knew very little about Audition before I watched . The final 30 or so minutes blew me away . I'm not going to go into detail as this would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it . Just be prepared for one of the most shocking endings you'll ever likely see . - The plot starts out as something right out of a Hollywood romantic-comedy . A middle-aged man wants to find a new wife . A producer friend of his sets up a series of bogus movie auditions as a way of meeting women . Does it sound enough like typical Hollywood tripe ? The man meets the woman of his dreams . Or is she ? What dark secrets does she hide ? Watch and be amazed . - The acting is first rate . The two leads , Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina , are both excellently cast . Ishibashi comes across as a sympathetic figure who simply wants a companion . Shiina's performance is excellent as the seemingly demure woman with a hidden secret . - Takashi Miike is certainly a director that can be mentioned with the greats of the genre . The images he presents may be difficult to watch , but they aren't easily forgotten . Cinematography , editing , lighting , and the use of dream sequences are all first rate . Since I watched Audition , I've read numerous complaints about how slow the first part of the movie is . While it may seem slow to those more accustomed to Hollywood films where somebody is killed or something is blown-up every five minutes , the slow pace is absolutely necessary to increase the shock value of the end . Miike knew what he was doing . - There are any number of ways to interpret the film . I'm sure that with subsequent viewings , I'll look at the events the movie presents in a different light . There's a lot here to take in during one viewing . I'm almost positive that I'll change the rating of Audition to a after a second viewing .
366763	3109237	516899	9.0	One of the series ' best	A series of otherwise unrelated murders have a few things in common . Namely , the perpetrator in each instance appears to be unstoppable . Neither bullets nor doors slow him down . Steed and Mrs . Peel are called in to investigate and soon find the genius behind a technology company is central to all the murders . But he's wheelchair-bound . He couldn't be responsible for the killings . Or could he ? " The Cybernauts " has to be one of my all-time favorite episodes of The Avengers that I've seen . The mix of sci-fi , espionage , horror , and that touch of humor ever present in the show make this one near perfect . The tension gets turned up a notch as Mrs . Peel becomes the mistaken target of an unstoppable killer . The finale is more than satisfying . The special effects may be laughable when compared to what we have today , but to me that's part of the shows charm . Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee are wonderful . In just a few episodes , the two work together as if they had done so forever . They are joined in " The Cybernauts " by the very capable Michael Gough . Even though he's in a wheelchair the entire episode , he's an actor quite capable of dominating any scene he's in . Nicely done by everyone involved ! If you've never seen The Avengers and are curious about the fuss , " The Cybernauts " would be a good one to start with .
366221	3109237	24184	9.0	" I think we'll start with a reign of terror . "	People tend to use the word " classic " too freely . I can't help but laugh when I hear some of the movies that people call " classics " . The term gets thrown around so much that it often looses some of its importance and real meaning . I try to reserve " classic " to a select group of films that I believe have achieved a certain status and have withstood the test of time . And I have no problem putting the label " classic " on The Invisible Man . James Whale made a lot of great films in the 1930s . Some ( Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein , for example ) may be better known , but I've always thought of The Invisible Man as the best of the bunch . It's got everything . Terrific performances , incredible special effects , nice comedic touches , and technical brilliance are found in abundance throughout the film . - Terrific Performances : For someone who only has a few seconds of actual screen time , Claude Rains is amazing . His voice creates such a presence that at times it's easy to forget that he's not actually there . As for Una O'Connor , I've seen some people complain about Whale's use of her , but I think she was never better than in The Invisible Man . She's great whether playing the proper landlord showing a new guest to his room or as the overly hysterical woman afraid for her life . The rest of the cast , especially E . E . Clive and Gloria Stuart , is exceptional . - Incredible Special Effects : It's amazing to revisit The Invisible Man and see how well the special effects have withstood the passage of time . They were state-of-the-art in 1933 and they remain impressive today . It took some real craftsmanship to pull-off the invisibility gags seen in The Invisible Man . To me , none is more impressive than the first time we get a glimpse under the bandages while he's eating and we see no lower jaw . Impressive stuff ! - Nice Comedic Touches : Billed as a horror film , The Invisible Man actually contains more scenes of humor than horror . I've already mentioned O'Connor , but she's only a small part of the humor in the film . The police , the various frightened passersby , and even Claude Rains himself add to the fun found in The Invisible Man . I'm of the opinion that it never goes overboard , but fits nicely into the plot . - Technical Brilliance : Beyond the special effects , the film is wonderful from a technical standpoint . Lighting , cinematography , and set design are incredible and some of the best of the 30s . Everything looks perfect . In my opinion , Whale never did better . I've always been impressed by the way Whale used his camera as part of the action when many of his contemporaries seemed content with the " plant it and shoot " style of film-making . The only negative aspect of the film that I can possibly complain about is William Harrigan in the role of Rains ' rival , Dr . Arthur Kemp . He's just not as good as those around him . Other than that little quibble , I've got nothing to complain about . I believe it should be easy to see why I , for one , consider The Invisible Man a classic !
366644	3109237	43132	9.0	Amazingly well made	At first glance , it would seem natural to compare Where the Sidewalk Ends with Laura . Both have noirish qualities , both were directed by Otto Preminger , and both star Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney . But that's where most of the comparisons end . Laura dealt with posh , sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder . Where the Sidewalk Ends is set in a completely different strata . These are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties . Where the Sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon . Small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks . Getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing . While I haven't seen his entire body of work , based on what I have seen , Dana Andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop , Det . Sgt . Mark Dixon . He's the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession . One night , he goes too far and accidentally kills a man . He does his best to cover it up . But things get complicated when he falls for the dead man's wife , Morgan Taylor ( Tierney ) , whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case . As Morgan's father means the world to her , Dixon's got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself . Technically , Where the Sidewalk Ends is outstanding . Besides the terrific performance from Andrews , the movie features the always delightful Tierney . She has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter . The rest of the cast is just as solid with Tom Tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout . Beyond the acting , the direction , sets , lighting , and cinematography are all top-notch . Overall , it's an amazingly well made film . If I have one complaint ( and admittedly it's a very , very minor quibble ) it's that Tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings . It's a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory characters . It's not really her fault , it's just the way Tierney comes across . She seems a little too beautiful , polished , and delicate for the part . But , her gentle , kind , trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal .
366469	3109237	751441	9.0	One of my favorite episodes	Not having seen " A Day in the Life " since it initially aired in 1997 , I was happy to finally see it again recently as I waded through the Season 2 DVD set . Looking around the internet , this episode appears to be either one of the most loved or most hated episodes depending on which side of the fence you fall . There's not much middle ground . I would place somewhere in my top five favorite episodes . Before " A Day in the Life " , I caught Xena from time to time , but it was no big deal . This is the episode that made me one of those can't - wait - until - Sunday - night - for - the - new - episode kind of fans . " A Day in the Life " stands out as being unusual when compared with most of the other Xena episodes . The action and fighting are relegated to a sub-plot . As the name implies , " A Day in the Life " focuses on the everyday lives of Xena and Gabrielle . Everyday tasks like sleeping , cooking , and even going to the bathroom take center stage . To give it a more natural look , hand held camera are used to get that reality TV look . Little things like Gabrielle fussing about a bent frying pan or Xena and Gabrielle kicking each other as they walk down a path or Xena catching fish for a meal make you feel like you've gotten some insight to what makes these characters tick . It's different , it's funny , and it's one of my favorites .
366659	3109237	46911	10.0	Movies don't get much better than this	- I've seen Les Diaboliques with its very high rating on IMDb for a few years . But I thought to myself , it can't be that good - it's French . I finally gave it a chance . How wrong was I ? I've never been more happy with a blind purchase in my life . - Michel Delasalle ( Paul Meurisse ) is the headmaster of an all-boys school . He's an abusive person to both his wife ( Vera Clouzot - the director's wife ) and his mistress ( Simone Signoret ) - both of whom work at the school . The wife and mistress decide they can't take it anymore and hatch a plot to kill Michel . The plan is carried out and the body is placed where it can be found . The problem is no one finds the body . It's gone . Things turn from bad to worse ( and more horrifying ) when students begin reporting that they have seen Michel roaming through the school . Any more of the story would be far too much . - I do my best not to rate a movie after a first viewing . But every once in a while , I stumble upon a real classic that I can't help but call perfect . The acting is very impressive , especially Vera Clouzot as the fragile wife . I felt every emotion she expressed . The plot is fantastic . Even though I figured out what was going to happen , it didn't matter . The movie is so well written that it was just a joy to watch it unfold . The sets are about the best I've seen . Everything looked just as I would expect from a French movie made so close to end of the war . Nothing was changed to make things look " pretty " . It's dirty and it works . I could go on and on like this , but you get the idea . - Clouzot has been called the " French Hitchcock " and it's easy to see why . He handles a movie with Hitchcockian type themes as well as Hitchcock might have himself . His decision to allow the movie the time necessary to build atmosphere and to allow the audience to get to know the characters is something I find sorely missing in many of today's movies . - I highly recommend this one .
366724	3109237	56197	10.0	" John has a long mustache . "	I've lost count of the number of times I've watched The Longest Day . In my opinion , it's one of the best , most enjoyable films I've ever seen and it rests firmly in my top 25 . I look forward to revisiting it each chance I get . What do I like about The Longest Day ? Almost everything . I know the film has its share of detractors who complain about the film's length , the historical inaccuracies , the number of cameos , the " flag waving " , or the lack of realistic bloodshed amongst other things . I don't have a problem with any of this . The film's length ? not a problem . If anything , I always want more . The historical inaccuracies ? not a problem . There's a whole page of goofs listed on IMDb . I'm not a historian and I'm not about to let the fact that someone was carrying the wrong sidearm get in the way of my enjoyment . The number of cameos ? not a problem . The only cameo that I feel is unnecessary is the one of Rod Steiger . I enjoy all of the others . The " flag waving " ? not a problem . The Allies , of which the U . S . A . was a part , should be proud of their victory in WWII . The lack of realistic bloodshed ? not a problem . The carnage depicted in Saving Private Ryan may be missing , but the atmosphere and " feeling " are still there . In short , it's damn near a perfect film as far as I'm concerned .
