366561	3109237	113135	1.0	" I have a job too ; I'm a tool . "	I've just about reached my limit . I've watched more than my share of bad movies in the past few months . Sure , as is the case with Future War , I've watched many of these movies courtesy of and with the assistance of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - but I've watched them just the same . Future War may be the last for a while . It's so bad I'm ready to swear off bad movies all together . The plot is a completely ridiculous mish-mash of incomprehensible ideas that never made a lick of sense to me . Something about a traveler from the future with cyborgs and their dinosaur " trackers " hot on his heels . The only person he's got to turn to for help is a former druggy / prostitute turned nun facing a crisis of faith . Like I said , none of it makes sense . I've said this so many times that I'm starting to sound like a broken record , but Future War is bad in every way a movie can be bad . The acting is beyond pitiful . Neither of the movies ' two leads , Daniel Bernhardt or Travis Brooke Stewart , seem capable of acting their way onto a community theater stage , let alone a sound-stage . Most surprising to me is that Bernhardt went on to have a fairly successful career , because in Future War , he comes across as nothing more than a Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe without any of Van Damme's talent . ( Did I just insinuate that Van Damme has talent ? ) Beyond the acting , the special effects are of particular note . The dinosaurs are about the most Gawd awful things I've seen in a movie . I could film something about as realistic with the plastic dinosaurs my son has in his room . Wait a minute - I think that might be what they used ! Finally ( and believe me , I could go on forever ) , the editing in Future War is atrocious . Some scenes are edited so poorly that it's all but impossible to follow the action . Overall , Future War is about as bad as a movie can get . I can't really come up with an inspired description , so I'll end this by saying , " It sux ! "
366639	3109237	80646	1.0	Inept is the word that comes to mind	Based on a lot of what I've read about Don't Go in the House , it seems to be a Love It or Hate It kind of movie . There appears to be very little middle ground . Put me in the Hate It category . If you take a look at some of the other stuff I've reviewed and enjoyed , you'll notice I do not automatically write-off a movie because of a low budget . Some of my favorites fall into the low-to-no budget category . But what those movies have that is sorely lacking in Don't Go in the House is talent . This is one of the most inept pieces of celluloid I've watched . It comes off as some kind of lame Psycho rip-off without anything approaching entertainment to be found in the entire runtime . It's dull , poorly acting , poorly directed , and poorly scripted . I feel like I've just flushed the $11 . 98 I paid for the DVD down the commode .
366021	3109237	377707	1.0	I wasn't prepared for what I've just seen .	WARNING ? Watching Crocodile could prove hazardous to your physical , mental , and emotional health . Having just finished watching Crocodile , I'm almost dumbfounded by the ineptitude I've witnessed . I had been warned by a couple of trusted friends that the movie was bad , but nothing could prepare for what I've just seen . To call Crocodile bad would be an understatement an an insult to other bad movies . It's one of the worst examples of movie-making I've ever seen . The plot , as best I could discern , involves a man whose entire family is killed by a giant crocodile . The man vows revenge . Sound familiar ? While even the worst of the other " Man vs . Nature " movies I've seen handle this scenario with a little class , originality , or a minimum of technical skill , Crocodile is pathetic in comparison . Acting ? as bad as I've seen . Music ? never appropriate to the image . Editing ? sloppy is too nice a word . Special effects ? what's that ? Plot ? see Jaws . Cinematography ? a monkey could have framed the shots better . Crocodile excels in poorly constructed miniatures , random shots of people and objects that have no bearing on the plot , and an overall incoherence that makes the movies Ed Wood and Al Adamson seem like masterpieces . Consider yourself warned . .
366604	3109237	100273	1.0	Someone should have fed this movie to the shark	This is one really bad movie . I've racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make . The acting is atrocious . I've seen more believable performances on cable access . The plot is ridiculous . Stolen diamonds , secret recordings of the President , and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst . Night of the Sharks isn't even so bad it's good . The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed . And to top it off , Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard . I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record . From everything I've read , the Italian film industry was dead by 1987 . Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin .
366218	3109237	79300	1.0	Simply Awful	- Such as it is , I'll try to give a brief outline of the movie . During a photo session , the photographer strangles his model . Meanwhile , a bookstore owner stalks and knives a wino . Later , the same photographer strangles another model . The bookstore owner stalks and knives another wino . This continues until the two meet . Without a word , they seem to fall in love . But what kind of relationship can two serial killers have ? Apparently , not much of one . - The Hollywood Strangler Meets the Skid Row Slasher is the perfect example of inept film-making . If you're idea of a good time is watching people you don't know kill other people you don't know , this may be the movie for you . This basic premise is repeated over and over and over . Eventually , I just wanted to throw something at the screen . How about a little explanation as to who these people are and why they are doing what they do ? Unfortunately , concepts like a plot don't get in the way of the killing . - Steckler filmed this movie without any dialogue . He later added some voice overs at the insistence of his distributor . Dialogue may have helped , although I doubt it . - If you really must see this movie , watch it with Joe Bob Briggs commentary . There are a few laugh out loud moments . Otherwise , I found it impossible to get through even the first 10 minutes .
365999	3109237	82744	1.0	Avoid at all cost !	After watching this " movie " I did what I usually do ? I looked it up on IMDb . When I saw the rating , I had to check to make sure I was looking at the right " movie " . 4 . 4 ! Come on ! That's about 3 . 4 points too high . I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time , but Midnight certainly ranks with the very worst . As far as I'm concerned , it's not fit for human consumption . It comes off as some kind of Psycho / Texas Chainsaw Massacre wannabe but fails miserably at every level . I'm not even sure I can call Midnight a " movie " . I suppose that if your definition of a " movie " is limited to a series of moving pictures , then it qualifies . But my definition of a " movie " includes such luxuries as a plot , acting , and some level of entertainment ? none of which are found here . I cannot think of one kind thing to say about this " movie " . In fact , I should end here as I've already given Midnight far too much of my time .
366864	3109237	57970	1.0	Forget Manos and Plan 9 - This is the Grandaddy of Bad Movies	- A few days ago , I wrote that The Skydivers was one of the two or three worst movies I had ever seen . Well , I had completely forgotten about The Creeping Terror . This is the Grandaddy of Bad Movies . Forget what you've heard about films like Manos or Plan 9 - there not even in the same ballpark with this pile of llama dung . The ineptitude on display is mind boggling . - The story concerns an alien monster who has landed on Earth and begins feeding on the populace . The monster resembles an old , large carpet with five or six guys underneath . The monster has no arms , so he must get his mouth ( I suppose it could be called a mouth ) close to his prey in order to eat them . In one of the most ridiculous scenes ever filmed , the female victim can be seen actually climbing up into the creatures mouth . The monster moves slower than any other creature I've ever seen . The creature from The Blob is greased lightening compared with this monster . And the people in the movie seem willing to oblige the slow moving carpet . They look absolutely silly just sitting and waiting to be consumed . - One of my favorite scenes is the face-off between the Shag Monster and the Army ( here , the Army consists of six guys in the back of a pickup truck ) . As the trained soldiers move in with their toy guns at the ready , they are careful to stay in a very tight pack . Just when they least suspect it , the monster charges ( at the breakneck speed of 0 . 5 mph ) and crushes the tightly packed soldiers . What drama ! - The movie is not without lessons for those who pay attention . For some inexplicable reason , in the middle of the film we are treated to a 10 minute lecture on how life changes after marriage . The narration is straight out of one of those 1950s school films . - As bad as this movie is , and it just may be the worst I've ever seen , this is actually my second viewing of The Creeping Terror . I'm a glutton for this kind of stuff .
366276	3109237	57859	1.0	" Three new bodies . Fresh , live , young bodies . "	I see that the movie I've watched twice under the name The Atomic Brain is actually known as Monstrosity . Monstrosity , huh ? Well , it fits . I can't think of a more appropriate name for this dog of a movie than Monstrosity . When it comes to bad movies , this one is scrapping the bottom of the barrel . Everything about it is just so Gawd awful . I could run down the list ( production values , acting , lighting , etc . ) but there's really no point . Name any aspect of movie making and The Atomic Brain ( or Monstrosity if you prefer ) fails miserably at it . In short , this is truly one of the five or so worst movies I've ever seen . Many of the reviews on IMDb call The Atomic Brain a " good " bad movie . I'm as big a fan of bad movies as anyone , but this one doesn't work for me . The bad movies I enjoy are at least fun . This one is too dour for me to have any fun with . As I noted , this is the second time I've seen The Atomic Brain . Fortunately for me , I watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version this time around . And while it made the experience much more palatable , it's not one of the better MST3K episodes I've seen . The movie is so bad it puts a damper on the comedy . But I'll be generous and give it a on my MST3K rating scale ? a whishy-washy average rating .
366769	3109237	75343	1.0	" Chicken . Corn . Green peppers . Chili . Onions . . . . "	For whatever reason , I have now seen Track of the Moon Beast on two different occasions ? once with the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary and once without . Should I decide to waste another 90 or so minutes for a third viewing , there's really only one viewing option ? watch the MST3K version . Track of the Moon Beast is painful . The idiocy on display can actually start to hurt without the MST3K commentary to take the edge off . From Native American anthropologist Johnny Longbow and his stew recipe to the terry-cloth hot-pants worn by Donna Leigh Drake , Track of the Moon Beast is filled with a nonsensical plot , uninteresting characters , bad acting , poor special effects , brainless dialogue , and bottom of the barrel sound , cinematography , and lighting . You don't get much worse than this . One of my " favorite " moments occurs when old Johnny Longbone is relating the Native American legend of the Lizard-Man to the sheriff . He has an overhead projector with a number of transparencies he uses to illustrate his story . Well , Longbritches ' drawings look about like something you would see drawn in my son's Pre-K class . They're so ridiculous looking ! It cracks me up every time I see it .
366399	3109237	59464	1.0	A complete waste of celluloid	If you've read the background of Monster A Go-Go then you know that the movie almost didn't exist . Hackmeister Bill Rebane started filming the movie in 1961 . A shortage of cash forced him to shelf the project . A few years later , fellow B-filmmaker Herschel Gordon Lewis was looking for a film to complete a double-bill and bought Rebane's unfinished movie . Whether he added new material or only re-edited what was already there is up to conjecture , but the result was Monster A Go-Go . I've seen a slew of bad movies in my life , but only a very few of them are as bad as Monster A Go-Go . Over the years , I've rated several films a ( Laserblast , Midnight , and Invasion of the Star Creatures for example ) , but this one joins that special fraternity of films that make-up the worst of the worst . Monster A Go-Go takes a place beside the likes of Prime Evil and The Starfighters as a complete waste of celluloid . Monster A Go-Go is a total bore and features nothing that remotely resembles entertainment . When a film loses a viewer's interest 30 seconds into its runtime , you know you're in trouble . And if possible , Monster A Go-Go takes this incredibly putrid start and builds on it . The movie actually becomes increasingly pointless and dull throughout its 70 minutes as it limps toward one of the worst endings ever put to a movie . The movie doesn't really end as much as Rebane or Lewis or whoever just stopped filming . If only they would have stopped filming about 70 minutes earlier . This was another MST3K viewing for me . Normally , I get a kick out of MST3K regardless of how bad the movie is . But Monster A Go-Go is just so bad that it really puts a drag on everything . I give them credit for attempting to make the movie in any way worthwhile , but it seems to have been an impossible task . I give this episode of MST3K a - find another episode to add to the top of your " to see " list .
366337	3109237	66476	2.0	" This is where the fish lives . "	Sometimes I feel like I ramble on and on when I'm writing one of these . No worries this time though , because I'm keeping it short and sweet . The Touch of Satan is one of the biggest bores of a movie to ever come down the pike . Lackluster people doing dull and unimaginative things make for one excruciating experience . Even when Grandma shows up and hacks up a few people , it's met with the same ho-hum enthusiasm as the rest of the movie . For what it's worth , I've rated The Touch of Satan an incredibly generous . As with many of the " bad " movies I've been watching lately , I saw The Touch of Satan courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While some of the riffs ( particularly those about the long pauses in the dialogue ) are very funny , overall the episode is too inconsistent to rate too highly . I'll give Episode # 908 a wishy-washy and very average on my MST3K rating scale .
365913	3109237	55452	2.0	It may be miserable , but it's a hoot !	Even by Ed Wood's standards , The Sinister Urge is a miserable movie . Everything you would expect to find in an Ed Wood film is here ? a ridiculous plot , bad acting , stilted dialogue , poor editing , and bad set design . Most of the " action " takes place behind a desk on an all but barren set as two policemen drone on an on about nothing . There's one scene that must be seen to be believed involving a " taxpayer " who shows up to demand to know what the police are doing . They give Mr . Taxpayer a good lecture about the dangers of pornography and how it leads to all sorts of other crimes including murder , kidnapping , jay-walking , terrorism , and ripping tags off mattresses . It's a hoot ! But as I've said before when discussing Ed Wood's movies , even with all the problems , there's a love for the art form that you can see just under the surface . Ed Wood wasn't the most gifted filmmaker and he often worked in less than stellar conditions , but there's no denying his love of movies . He just didn't have the wherewithal to make a " good " one .
366231	3109237	55562	2.0	Very Early Sonny Chiba	To be honest , Invasion of the Neptune Men is about as bad a movie as I've seen . Maybe it's the cut of the movie I've seen or maybe something is lost in the translation from Japanese or maybe it's meant for a different age group , but whatever , it's bad . ( Note : I haven't rated the movie a because although it's bad , it's not offensively bad . ) Instead of getting into the myriad of problems , I want to focus on why I've now seen The Invasion of the Neptune Men at least four times . I can think of two reasons off the top of my head to explain why I continue to re-watch Invasion of the Neptune Men . One , ( and I admit I'm pushing it here ) the chance to see an early Sonny Chiba . I'm not an expert on Chiba , but what I've seen , I really like . From his work in The Street Fighter , Golgo 13 , and up to and including Kill Bill , Chiba is the MAN . So it's really cool to get the chance to go back and watch him in what is really his second movie . He's barely recognizable as the lame hero , Space Chief . Two , Invasion of the Neptune Men is one of my very favorite episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While I may only rate the movie a , I give this episode a on my MST3K rating scale . Some of the riffs are laugh out loud funny no matter how many times I've heard them . The bits about Space Chef , the Hitler building , and the kids in their shorts are hysterical . As I said , I've seen this episode at least four times and can probably re-watch it many more without getting tired of it .
366222	3109237	88780	2.0	It's like a guy wearing a black bathroom rug and false teeth	I'm not sure if Beauties and the Beast is a movie or just a compilation of someone's home movies . The plot , if you can call it that , involves a Bigfoot type creature terrorizing a bunch of hippies and nudists in the woods . The creature looks more like a guy wearing a black bathroom rug and false teeth than an actual Bigfoot . He kidnaps girl after girl taking them to his blanket furnished cave . He gropes them a couple of times and that's about it . I have no idea what happened to this girls or if they ever escaped . This film doesn't bother with things like that . In reality , Beauties and the Beast is a cheap , poorly made , and horribly acted excuse of a softcore porn film . Everything is simply awful . I can't think of any reason , and that includes the generous supply of nudity , to recommend this one to anyone . It's just so gawd awful ! And if you must watch this thing , beware of the soundtrack . It's a two pronged assault against the senses . First , there's the generic , overly-sappy elevator music . It almost put me to sleep on a couple of occasions ( that , and the dull movie ) . Second , one of the hippies insists on singing a folk song . I think my ears may still be bleeding .
366037	3109237	46248	2.0	" You look like a pooped out pinwheel . "	Why do I do this to myself ? I know that there are those who have seen Robot Monster more times than I have , but when you loath a movie as much as I do this one , why would you watch it three times ? Yes , that's right ? I think Robot Monster is one of the absolute worst movies ever made with virtually no entertainment or other value , yet I've sat through it on three different occasions . I've tried watching it as a " serious " piece of sci-fi ? that obviously won't work . I've tried watching it through the eyes of a child ( as someone suggested ) ? sorry , that didn't work either . I've even tried watching it as a piece of unintentional comedy ? too boring for that . It makes for one of the worst MST3K episodes I've so far seen . I must have some sort of problem if I keep revisiting trash like this . I've noticed that many people go straight for the monster design when discussing Robot Monster . But Ro-Man , as he's known in the movie , is the least of the problems I have with the film . In fact , the image of the gorilla with the diving helmet is the only thing that keeps me from rating the movie lower . Whether intentional or some happy accident , the creature design is iconic . Many people who have never seen the movie or even know what movie it comes from have seen pictures of Ro-Man . Instead , my problems with the movie include every other factor you could think of . The acting is abysmal . Imagine my surprise when I noticed on IMDb that most of the cast actually had extensive acting backgrounds that just happened to include Robot Monster . Did they get on set and suddenly forget everything they knew about acting ? The music for Robot Monster was written early in his career by the famed composer Elmer Bernstein . I'm sure this is a proud entry on his resume . The opening music is mind-numbingly bad . Finally , the direction is terrible . The movie has no pace or flow . It's about as exciting as watching grass grow . As a cure for insomnia , Robot Monster might be a winner . But as a movie that provides entertainment on any level , Robot Monster is an unqualified disaster .
366672	3109237	450345	2.0	" Oh , no ! Not the bees ! Not the bees ! "	What a freakin ' joke ! The 1973 version of The Wicker Man is a true classic and one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen . The final scenes have lost nothing and remain as strong today as they were over 30 years ago . The 2006 version of The Wicker Man manages to take most everything that made the original such a wonderfully compelling piece of cinema and chuck it out the window . How you can take out the religious and sexual aspects that were a focus of the original story and still call it The Wicker Man ? And what do you use to replace the religious and sexual aspects so key to understanding the central character ? Bees ! Yes , that's right ? bees , for God's sake ! What an insult ! There's a story that the original negatives of the 1973 film were buried in a landfill under a roadway in England . Why couldn't it have been the 2006 abomination ?
366277	3109237	66326	3.0	" I said the wheel felt mushy ! "	San Francisco International ( SFI for the rest of this ) follows what I've started calling a Love Boat style of plot development . You know ? a movie or television show with an ensemble cast where each character has their own storyline that may or may not have anything to do with the other characters . One plot line is deadly serious , another is romantically charged , the next is played for laughs , and on and on it goes . I don't know where the Love Boat plot style first originated , but SFI follows this to a " T " . The story lines in SFI include : a boy , upset over his parents divorce , climbs into an abandoned plane and takes off ; a band of crooks robs a shipment of cash going through the airport ; seeking additional funding for the airport , airport head honcho Jim Conrad ( Pernell Roberts ) fakes an emergency landing with a planeload of government officials ; a businessman and a hippie get into an altercation ; etc . But being a 70s made-for-TV movie , you know everything is going to work out fine in the end ? not that you really care or anything . There are several reasons why SFI never made it to our television sets as a regular series . And chief among them as far as I'm concerned is Pernell Roberts . Being self-assured is one thing , but Roberts ' character comes off as one of the smuggest in history . He's too unlikable to care about any of his problems and whether they get resolved or not . You can't build a series around a horses rear-end like Jim Conrad and expect anyone to watch . As with a lot of the " bad " movies I've been watching lately , I saw SFI courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . And as far as a MST3K episode goes , SFI is a keeper . A laugh at every turn . If you're a fan of the show , do yourself a favor and seek it out . This one gets a on my MST3K rating scale .
366275	3109237	66492	3.0	" Get me my hypo-gun - quickly ! "	A group of students stumble upon a cavern in the English countryside . Inside they discover an ape-like creature that just might be the missing link between apes and man . Dr . Brockton ( Joan Crawford ) takes an interest in the boys ' discovery and begins a study of the troglodyte that she nicknames Trog . Just as Dr . Brockton's experiments begin to show some promise , opposition to her experiments takes shape in the form of Sam Murdock ( Michael Gough ) who would like to see Trog destroyed . He tries to do just that and accidentally sets Trog loose to go on a murderous rampage . Trog is the kind of movie I really want to like . As far as camp appeal goes , it's got it in spades . The mere sight of Joan Crawford patting a poorly made-up ape / man on the head or playing fetch with him or feeding him rubber lizards should be enough to endear Trog to me . But it never quite works that way . Why ? The movie is an interminable bore . By the time Trog goes on his rampage , it's too late . I've lost all interest . As others have commented , Trog certainly is an unfitting swan song for an actress as legendary as Joan Crawford . But you've really gotta hand it to her . A professional to the end . Her delivery and acting may come across as ridiculous and over-the-top given the material and subject matter she was presented with in Trog , but that's just Joan doing what she did best ? giving it her all .
366106	3109237	56961	3.0	" No rats , not allowed ! "	A space capsule is destroyed upon re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere sending a shower of wreckage across a Southern California beach . A teenager finds the astronaut's dismembered arm and ( inexplicably ) takes it home . How could he possibly know that the arm is possessed by a killer force or that he too will come under its influence ? I've watched a lot of really bad movies lately , but The Crawling Hand is far from the worst . In fact , it's almost " good " in comparison with dreck like Monster A Go-Go and The Starfighters ( yes , I've been on something of a MST3K binge lately ) . The movie has its share of problems ( hit and miss acting , obvious budgetary constraints , a ridiculous premise , etc . ) , but there are some nice moments mixed in here and there . Chief among them is the scene in the malt shop when the owner is attacked . The action , lighting , sound , and cinematography found in this scene far exceed anything you might expect to see in a movie with the reputation of The Crawling Hand . The two biggest problems I have with the movie seem to rarely get mentioned ? the shift from the hand of the movie's title to " teen angst " movie and the amount of padding used to extend the film's runtime . So while I may never think of The Crawling Hand as a masterpiece , I certainly see it in a better light than the majority of comments I've read . As The Crawling Hand is from the first season of MST3K , it suffers from the same lack of consistent riffing that plagues most of the early episodes . But in comparison with the other first season episodes I have seen , it's among the best . There is a bit involving a telephone that is very funny . Overall , I'll give this episode of MST3K a very generous ? a wishy-washy average rating .
366802	3109237	89104	3.0	" No sugar you idiot ! "	I should have known better ? a sequel to a movie ( 1990 : The Bronx Warriors ) that itself is barely average . Generally , sequels have a hard time matching the standard set by the original . And even though the standard isn't very high in this case , Escape from the Bronx is a failure in comparison with its predecessor . First , the sequel lacks any imagination . We see the same gunfights and explosions we saw in the first film . Half of the death scenes could have been spliced in from 1990 : The Bronx Warrior and I doubt anyone would notice . Second , if possible the acting is even worse this time around . Mark Gregory ( and his painted on pants ) wasn't much of an actor in the first film . Here , he seems to have regressed . Also , I've read review after review that gush about Henry Silva's performance in Escape from the Bronx . My response ? what performance ? He spends 90 % of his already limited screen-time on the phone . What's so impressive about that ? Third , I never thought I would miss Fred Williamson , but he's part of what made 1990 : The Bronx Warriors as good as it was . An overacting Antonio Sabato is a poor replacement . And finally , the plot in Escape from the Bronx is completely absurd . The scenes of Manhattan indicate that very little has changed in the future . I would assume that would include people's perceptions on the value of human life . The notion that a company would have a business model that includes wiping-out the citizens of an entire city is ridiculous . That company wouldn't be around very long .
366553	3109237	110018	3.0	The weakest of the five	- In the final Hercules made-for-television movie , Hercules is called upon to save a village from a Minotaur . But things are not as simple as they seem . The Minotaur has a secret that Hercules must overcome if he is to save himself and the village . - This is easily the weakest of the five movies that preceded the television series . Half of the running time is filled with flashbacks from the four previous movies . It gets old real quick . The actual battle with the Minotaur is a disappointment as well . The costume worn by the actor playing the Minotaur makes it all but impossible for him to move with any grace during the fight scenes . The relationship between Hercules and Iolaus , which would become one of the highlights of the television series , seems very unnatural . Almost all of the dialogue is designed to set up the next flashback . - Too bad , because this one has a lot of potential . The plot concerning the Minotaur's secret is one of the best in the five movies . Although the way it is handled makes it very obvious for anyone to guess .
366881	3109237	402022	3.0	" We're meant to die . Its what makes everything about us matter . "	Aeon Flux ( Charlize Theron ) is an assassin in the year 2415 . She works for a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the government . Her target is Trevor Goodchild ( Marton Csokas ) , the leader of what's left of Earth . But before Aeon can pull the trigger , something strange happens . A memory is sparked of a previous life when she knew Goodchild . She discovers that for the past 400 years everyone on Earth has been infertile . The human race has carried on through an intricate system of cloning . Trevor tells her that he is near to finding a solution to the problem . But there are some who would have things stay as they are . Trevor Goodchild's brother , Oren ( Jonny Lee Miller ) has plans to overthrow Trevor to maintain the status quo . Aeon changes her mission ? now she must protect Trevor , stop Oren , and end the cycle of cloning . I'm really starting to hate the modern brand of action movies . What happened to the good old days when it was all about shooting people and blowing things up ? Why do filmmakers feel the need to hide their action movies behind a faux sense of intelligence ? Despite all the weird flashback scenes , the annoyingly vague character motivations , and the intentionally muddled plot points , Aeon Flux is no smarter than any other action movie . In fact , all this pseudo-intellectual garbage does is confuse matters to the point the movie becomes incredibly dull . Scene after scene of people talking nonsense does not make for a good action film . And that's just what you get in Aeon Flux . Add to that some of the most uninteresting characters I've seen recently and you've got the makings of an infuriatingly boring movie . The worst offender in this regard has to be Jonny Lee Miller ( though if truth be told , no one comes out looking good ? and that includes Charlize Theron ) . Miller is so dry , so white bread , he's hardly menacing at all . Laughable would be a better description . And why do filmmakers today feel the need to make every action movie look like The Matrix ? I'm no physicist or human physiologist , but people and things don't move and / or behave in nature like they do in these movies . There's a scene where Aeon is about to fall on sharpened blades of grass ( oh , how clever ) . The way she holds herself just inches above the ground with nothing but the insides of her feet is impossible . I'm so tired of seeing this kind of thing . For what it's worth , I'll rate Aeon Flux a .
366652	3109237	76820	3.0	In a word - disappointing	David Carradine is Harley Thomas , a moonshine runner . Trouble is , he's one of the small time operators . His fiancé , Nancy Sue Hunnicutt ( Kate Jackson ) , just happens to be the daughter of the biggest operator in the area . And R . J . Hunnicutt ( Roger C . Carmel ) doesn't take kindly to Harley's business or his relationship with his daughter . R . J . ' s also got a batch of poison moonshine set to go out . Harley and Nancy Sue make their mission to stop the truck carrying the tainted whiskey before it reaches its destination . The best word I can think of to describe Thunder and Lightning is disappointing . I had high hopes for this one , but for the most part , it's just plain dull . I usually enjoy most everything David Carradine has done and I've grown to be a fan of these 70s chase films , but I found very little to enjoy here . The comedy elements don't work , the fight scenes seem lazily done , and the acting is terrible . The whole thing seems to have been thrown together in a hurry as a cash-in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit . It's too bad because I like the idea of pairing Carradine with Kate Jackson . The best parts of the film are easily some of the car and boat chase stunts . The swamp boat scenes were great . Problem is these moments are too few and far between . Instead , we get too much of the bad attempts at humor and drama .
366408	3109237	53640	3.0	" Get off my back , Iris . I'm thinking ' . "	After knocking over a market , Eddy Crane ( Tony Travis ) and the rest of his gang stop at a diner for a bite to eat . Quite unexpectedly ( at least I didn't see it coming ) , Eddy begins singing to a little jazzy number playing on the jukebox . He's overheard by a talent agent who thinks he can make Eddy a star . Before you can say " Daddy-O " , Eddy's on TV and has a recording contract lined up . But Eddy can't escape his past . While celebrating his good fortune , one of his friends , Mooney ( Peter Breck ) , kills a bartender . Eddy's agent asks the gang to leave Eddy alone and gets stabbed for his efforts . The gang drags Eddy back down at every opportunity . Eddy's must ultimately fight for his freedom . I wonder if Paul Frees and the rest of those behind this bad idea of a movie had any concept of just what a " beatnik " was . It doesn't appear so . Calling this gang of self-centered , unintelligent , small-time hoods with a Pat Boone style crooner as its leader " beatniks " would have Maynard G . Krebs spinning in his grave . These aren't " beatniks " in the traditional sense of the word . These are not the philosophical counter-cultural bongo beaters Kerouac wrote about . If everyone involved wasn't in their 30s , I'd call them juvenile delinquents . Beatniks ? I don't think so . But beyond the misuse of " beatniks " , the movie has very little to offer . Some moments in The Beatniks might be appealing in that bizarrely entertaining sort of way , but not in any traditional sense . The plot it bad , the acting is horrible , and the cinematography is as lazy as I've seen recently . In short , The Beatniks isn't a very good movie .
366110	3109237	34613	3.0	At least it has Bela in it	Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful . To this end , he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies . I'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies . I don't remember it ever being fully explained . All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife . ( I'll just guess that it's spinal fluid . Spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s . ) You can pretty much guess the rest from here . There are a couple ( well , really more than a couple , but I'll only write about two ) of problems that I have with this movie . One is the way Bela is used . Sure , he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way ( BTW , the rest of the cast is simply abysmal ) . But , to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly . Also , why have him beat and / or kill every henchman he has ? Is it to make him look evil ? Well , someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil . The second problem I have is the idea of drugging brides . Why brides ? Wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do ? Watching Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims , I was reminded of the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer . In each case , there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control . ( BTW , an alternate title for this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides . I guess that partially explains the need for ' brides ' . )
366507	3109237	46264	3.0	These Russian fantasy movies just don't appeal to me	I'll skip the normal plot synopsis and get right to it . Besides , anything I could write about the plot would hardly matter as the American bastardization of Sadko that I watched appears to bear only a passing resemblance to either the original Russian movie or the classic Russian folktale on which it was based . First off , I wonder whose bright idea it was to turn the character named Sadko into Sinbad . Let's see , Sadko is a poor Russian musician ? Sinbad is an adventurous Middle-Eastern sailor . A lot of similarity there , huh ? Secondly , I really have to wonder if the Russian version of the movie included anything about a quest for a bird of happiness . I say this because in the end the bird hardly seems to matter at all . It's almost as if the idea of the bird was added to the American version to give some sort of justification for " Sinbad " going to sea . Beyond the problems of Americanizing this Russian movie , I have problems with the bits of the original Sadko that seep through . As I stated in my recent review of The Sword and the Dragon ( aka Ilya Muromets ) , I'm not a fan of this style of Russian movie or acting . " The Sword and the Dragon seemed to be filled with such broad overacting that it became absurd . I realize that the movie was made over 50 years ago in the Soviet Union . I understand that the movie is filled with messages and other pro-worker propaganda . And I appreciate the importance of the film as a relic of the communist system . But none of that means I have to actually like the movie . " If you change the title of the movie , this quote accurately reflects my feelings on The Magic Voyage of Sinbad . And even though I realize that my appreciation of the movie might be improved if I were to have the opportunity to see the original film , I doubt the change would be drastic . Like many others , I saw The Magic Voyage of Sinbad through Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I enjoyed this episode much more than the previously mentioned The Sword and the Dragon episode . Overall , some very funny riffs . I'll give episode # 505 a on my MST3K rating scale .
366611	3109237	92860	3.0	Enough of the bad jokes already .	- Reena the Seer ( Monique Gabrielle ) seeks the assistance of Deathstalker ( John Terlesky ) for a perilous journey . Deathstalker doesn't know that Reena is really Princess Evie in disguise . Reena / Evie is looking for someone to help her overthrow Jarek the Sorcerer ( John Lazar ) who previously overthrew her . The journey is full of obstacles - a murderous band of cut-throats , zombies , and an Amazon army . Of course the pair finally reach their destination for the final face-off with Jarek . - Deathstalker II is just one in a long line of movies that were made to cash-in on the success of Conan the Barbarian . I realize that most of this movie is played for laughs . But most of the jokes are anything but funny . Deathstalker II rips-off so many other movies , but does so with very little success . Take the exchange between Deathstalker and evil Sultana ( Toni Naples ) - Deathstalker , " Do you expect me to talk ? " - Sultana , " No , Deathstalker . I expect you to die . " It's moments like this that left me cringing . - The acting is , for the most part , exactly what you would expect . Gabrielle delivers her lines with the conviction usually reserved for kindergarten plays . But , something tells me that Gabrielle wasn't hired for the role because of her ability as a thespian . Terlesky comes off as the kind of guy you just want to slap for being such a smart aleck . Lazar , looking like a Duran Duran wannbe , is anything but menacing . Naples , for whatever reason , plays her role in a mostly straight fashion that doesn't fit with the rest of the nonsense going on . - If your interested in a history lesson covering the type of movies Conan the Barbarian spawned or if you like overly obvious attempts at humor , Deathstalker II may be the movie for you .
366180	3109237	60956	4.0	Marisa Mell and Margaret Lee would give any Bond girl a run for her money .	I'll keep the plot synopsis short and sweet . Most of Secret Agent Super Dragon was so unnecessarily confusing that little of the plot seemed to matter anyway . In this James Bond wannabe , CIA agent Super Dragon ( Ray Danton ) goes up against a Venezuelan drug lord who uses candy to distribute his merchandise . Anything else beyond that wouldn't be much more than speculation as I found myself completely in the dark during much of the movie . I'm not one who needs to be spoon-fed plot points , but how about making what's going on just a little clearer ? Too much of the movie seemed like a series of unrelated set pieces that didn't fit together . But the biggest problem with Secret Agent Super Dragon is the same thing that plagues a lot of these James Bond inspired films ? money . The James Bond movies had the financial backing to pull it off . These Italian movies like Secret Agent Super Dragon can't match that kind of money . As a result , they suffer from weak scripts and acting , a lack of interesting multiple locations , poor special effects , a very anti-climatic ending , and anything else you can spend money on to make a movie better . That's not to say the movie was a total waste . In fact , I enjoyed quite a bit of it . Danton is above average in the title role . He's slick and clever ? just what you would expect from a secret agent . Marisa Mell and Margaret Lee would give any Bond girl a run fir her money . Finally , there is a sense of fun about the movie that I liked a lot . Those behind the movie were smart enough to never take it too seriously . As a result , the movie's light , almost bubbly , feeling is an asset .
365987	3109237	929551	4.0	One of the weakest I've seen so far	As Urko plans his latest campaign to wipe-out the humanoids , Ape City is terrorized by a flying , prehistoric beast . The apes are not alone as the creature sees fit to frighten the humanoids and actually steals one of their cow-like creatures . Once again , Jeff , Bill , and Judy must save the human race . " Attack from the Clouds " has to be one of the very weakest installments I've seen so far in the Return to the Planet of the Apes series . The poor animation really hurts this one . The high flying scenes of creature and plane should be exciting . But not the way they're handled here . It's dull all the way through . And it doesn't help that much of the existing story line is pushed to the background . Oh well , there's always the next episode .
366878	3109237	929554	4.0	A very familiar plot	" Flames of Doom " is the first episode in the animated Return to the Planet of the Apes . If you are at all familiar with the basic Planet of the Apes storyline , not much in the first episode will surprise you . It features the basic set-up ? three astronauts ( one female named Judy and two males named Jeff and Bill ) crash on a mysterious planet that at first seems uninhabited . While searching for food and water , they run into a group of primitive humans . But the humans are not the dominate species on the planet . Instead , apes are in charge . By the end of the episode , Judy has disappeared in an earthquake fissure , Bill has been captured by the apes , and Jeff escaped with a primitive female named Nova . Other than setting up the rest of the series and the uncertain future of all three human characters , there's really not a lot I got out of " Flames of Doom " . It's just not terribly exciting . So instead of discussing " Flames of Doom " , I'll take this opportunity to write about a couple of my initial impressions of the series . First , it's really difficult to get used to Henry Corden doing the voice of General Urko . Whether he's giving orders to an underling or makes speeches to the ape council , Corden's Fred Flinstone voice is hard to take serious . Second , while I hope to get comfortable with Corden in a few episodes , I doubt I'll ever feel the same way about the animation . I wasn't expecting computer generated type images , but I do expect something more than what you'll find in this series . I'm not sure what you call this style of animation , but to me most of it looks like little more than a static background over which a camera moves attempting ( in vain ) to create the allusion of motion . There's nothing fluid or " animated " about any of it . I really hope things get better as I go along . After one episode , I'm not very impressed . So far , it's not difficult to understand why Return to the Planet of the Apes lasted only 13 episodes .
365975	3109237	63306	4.0	Stretches believability to the limit	Shayne ( Diane McBain ) , the leader of the Mini-Skirt Mob , has been jilted by her lover . Cowboy star Jeff Logan ( Ross Hagen ) left Shayne and has married straight-laced Connie ( Sherry Jackson ) . Shayne enlists the rest of her gang to help her get Jeff back ? even if that means killing him in the process . Oh , what a bad movie . This has to be the most unbelievable motorcycle gang I've ever seen . Most of the members of the Mob look like they've just spent hours working on their hair , make-up , and outfits . I've never seen women in a motorcycle gang so well quaffed . Watching Diane McBain ride a motorcycle has to be one of the funniest things I've seen . She looks so uneasy on her little bike as if she might fall over at any minute . The acting , for the most part , is just plain old horrible . McBain , Ross Hagen , and Sherry Jackson come across about as natural as McBain's piled-up , platinum hair . Logic doesn't exist . For example , if Logan is really such a champion rodeo star , why does he live in a camper that's smaller than my bathroom ? The problems with The Mini-Skirt Mob go on and on . So , why haven't I rated it any lower . There are some unintentional great moments in The Mini-Skirt Mob . It's all the things I've described that make the movie at least somewhat entertaining . Just when you think things can't get any worse , they do . The scene where the trailer blows up has to be a real highlight ( or lowlight , depending on how you look at these things ) . In a word , it's ridiculous . A couple of actors to keep an eye out for are Harry Dean Stanton and Patricia McCormack . It's hard to believe Stanton started out making this kind of stuff . He's definitely gone on to bigger and better things . As for McCormack , it was a treat to see the star of The Bad Seed ( 1956 ) all grown up .
366445	3109237	73396	4.0	" I've got beer and . . . vodka . "	- Over the years I've learned that anytime Joe Don Baker is the " star " of a movie , you know you're in trouble . I don't know what the people behind Mitchell were thinking , but Joe Don Baker cannot carry a movie . He's fine as a goofy sidekick to provide some comic relief , but he just looks silly trying to play an action star . - The plot really doesn't matter . The highlight of the movie is watching Baker run , drink beer , and recite goofy dialog . One of the weirdest moments in the movie is a scene with Baker and a little boy on a skateboard . The exchange they have is utterly ridiculous and feels like it belongs in another movie . - I'm not sure what Linda Evans , Martin Balsam , and John Saxon thought Mitchell would do for their careers , but it's certainly a low point . Fortunately for Saxon , he disappears about half way through and doesn't make it to the film's " dramatic " conclusion . I've always looked at Balsam as a fairly accomplished actor . He should have known better . As for Evans , her love scenes with Baker are enough to induce nausea . Hoyt Axton musical ode to Mitchell only adds to the ridiculous nature of the this scene . - I've seen Mitchell both with and without the MST3K commentary . The preferred viewing is with the commentary . I'm no MST3K expert , but this is my favorite episode that I've seen . Much of it is truly laugh-out-loud funny .
366338	3109237	38387	4.0	" Attention all cars , attention all cars "	Horribly disfigured in a lab accident , Hal Moffat ( Rondo Hatton ) seeks revenge against all those he blames for his condition . The police seem to be unable to put a stop to the killer they've dubbed the " Creeper " . During one of his escapes from the police , the Creeper hides out in an apartment occupied by a blind woman . The pair strike up an unlikely relationship that lasts until the woman discovers her new friend's true identity . Now her life is in danger ! It's difficult to discuss The Brute Man without discussing Rondo Hatton , but that's exactly what I want to do for a moment . The biggest problem with the movie is that it's pretty much a bore . Scene after scene of watching the Creeper . . . uhh . . . creep ( for the lack of a better word ) does not make for the most exciting of movie experiences . He's too slow ? too slow to hold my interest . And it doesn't help matters that the Creeper's relationship with the blind woman is so predictable . From the moment the pair met , I was waiting for the woman to say that there was a surgery that might cure her , but it cost too much . And I just knew the Creeper was going to try to help her out by killing someone to get the money she needed . No surprises here . As for Rondo , I wish I knew more about him . He seems to have been a tragic , yet interesting fellow . In the few movies I've seen him in , he was never asked to do much . His acromegaly seems to be all that the studios were interested in . I doubt it , but I sincerely hope that he was able to exploit the movie studios just as they were exploiting him . And even though Rondo wasn't the world's greatest actor , there's something oddly compelling about his performance and The Brute Man in general . The Creeper is such a tragic character that it's difficult to fear him when you have such compassion for him and his predicament . While I cannot condone his actions , I certainly understand what drove him to commit his crimes . I've just got to give the movie an extra point based on Rondo . The Brute Man was featured in Episode # 702 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Overall , it's not particularly good . Too often , the guys resort to making fun of Rondo's medical condition ? not a very humorous topic . There are a few moments that do work , but overall , I'm disappointed . This episode of MST3K gets a on my rating scale .
366869	3109237	61456	4.0	The death of the beach movie	- As with most other beach movies , the plot in Catalina Caper is paper thin . The whole thing can be condensed into one sentence : ( from IMDb ) A group of swingin ' teens take time out from having fun in the sun to try to foil a group of crooks searching for a stolen scroll . - Beyond the terrible plot and script , the biggest single problem I have with the movie is the star , Tommy Kirk . He seems like a nice enough fellow and I've seen him give decent performances as a supporting player in some of the earlier beach movies , but he is completely unable to carry Catalina Caper as the lead . It doesn't help that he is surrounded by a group of no names with no talent . - The highlight of the movie has to be the song performed by Little Richard . It's an absolute hoot . He looks so stoned that I don't know how he was able to stand upright . - I watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of Catalina Caper . While not the best I've seen from MST3K , there were a few laughs here and there . My favorite bit from the MST3K crew had to be the " burn witch burn " chant during the opening night time bonfire dance scene .
365959	3109237	396230	4.0	The Stepford Wives deserves more than this	I just love DVDs with these mini-documentaries . The Stepford Life , however , isn't one of the best . There's just not enough interesting information or stories about the making of the movie and / or the people involved . All three of the actresses spend their interview time saying nothing but glowing things about each other . It's like one giant love-fest . They relate nothing of interest about working with one another . The director , Bryan Forbes , spends most of his screen time slamming the writer , William Goldman . He seems bitter about the whole thing . And the producer , Edgar Scherick , adds even less to the proceedings . A movie as good as The Stepford Wives deserves better than this .
366470	3109237	597049	4.0	A memorable cast , but that's about it	I recently finished watching " The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries " Season 1 DVD set and boy oh boy did it bring back memories . This particular episode may not have been the best , but it's one of the more memorable from the first season . The fact that it's memorable has nothing to do with the actual plot ( it happens to be one of the weakest of the bunch ) , but instead , it's memorable for the cast . A pre-Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis and a pre-Nightmare on Elm Street Robert Englund have supporting roles . From what I could tell , there's not much here to suggest the pair would go on and have the careers they've had . As for the episode itself , a wealthy couple hires a traveling carnival to help them put on a charity benefit . During the night , someone breaks into a safe and makes off with a fortune in jewelry . The carnival workers are immediately suspected . Nancy tags along to their next gig and , posing as a runaway , gets a job so she can investigate from the inside . As I said , it's one of the weakest episodes form Season 1 . It's far fetched and features some of the lamest motorcycle action sequences put on tape . The series generally works better when the plots deal with ghosts and other mysterious happenings .
365972	3109237	68284	5.0	Gotta love Denise Nicholas	In the 18th Century , Count Dracula invites an African Prince and his wife to his home in Transylvania to discuss an alliance between their two countries . Slavery and the Prince's wife prove to be the sticking point . Before the Prince can take his leave , Dracula attacks the Prince , places a curse on him , and puts his body in a locked casket for eternity . Centuries later , the Prince is released from his prison and almost immediately meets a woman who is remarkably similar to his wife . The Prince , now known as Blacula , will do whatever it takes to make this woman his new bride . Sounds familiar , huh ? The basic plot structure of Blacula has been seen countless times before . There's very little new ground broken here . In fact , and to be quite honest , Blacula isn't very good . Much of the acting is bad and the special effects are even worse . Blacula's makeup changes from scene to scene . Atmosphere and tension are totally foreign . Logic is non-existent . But what makes Blacula at least somewhat enjoyable are the Blaxplotation and other camp elements . Blacula is , of course , black and this is modern day ( 1972 ) America . Blacula swings at a nightclub to some very funky 70s music . Blacula's first two victims are a pair of homosexuals presented with every 70s stereotype intact . Blacula makes love with his intended victim . You won't see this stuff in just any old vampire film .
366176	3109237	116654	5.0	" I wanna go to Dog Heaven ! "	Where to start with this bizarre modern-day retelling of the H . G . Wells ' classic ? In many respects , The Island of Dr . Moreau is a train wreck of a movie . On so many levels , it's an unmitigated disaster . The problems on the set with the cast and crew are legendary . People getting fired , others getting mad and walking off , and some distracted by personal issues ? it must have been like living a soap opera . Maybe it's all these competing issues that helps to make what should be an unwatchable mess so interesting . For all its faults , The Island of Dr . Moreau is actually quite an enjoyable experience . Bizarre would be a good word to describe much of The Island of Dr . Moreau ? and I'm not just talking about the events in the movie's plot . The characters are just plain weird . Each appears to be competing with the other to be the most bizarre . David Thewlis ' Edward Douglas goes through range of emotions including fear , lust , anger , and disinterest . If it weren't for Marlon Brando , Val Kilmer's Montgomery would be one of the strangest characters in movie history . He's like some sort of butch game-keeper with a death wish . But Brando is in the movie and his Dr . Moreau tops everyone . The scene with Brando in a muumuu and an ice bucket hat is a sight that must be seen to be believed . Words cannot do it justice . Add to that the variety of half-man , half-animal creatures on the island and you've got one strange collection of characters . Speaking of the creatures , the make-up effects are the film's strongest assets . Some , like Hyena or the Sayer of the Law , are as good examples of creature make-up as you'll see . These effects do add a certain creepiness to the whole thing ( that is if you can keep from laughing at Brando's latest get-up ) . Despite enjoying much of the movie , I cannot call The Island of Dr . Moreau a particularly " good " movie ? not in the traditional sense anyway . The movie has too many problems to do that . The movie is terribly paced , any attempts at drama or horror are usurped by the ridiculousness of the characters , some of the special effects look like they came from a Nintendo 64 , and , frustratingly , none of the characters demonstrate anything remotely resembling common sense . As much as I hate to do it , but because of my mixed feelings , I feel forced to give The Island of Dr . Moreau a very wishy-washy .
366702	3109237	68577	5.0	Not even Peter Cushing can save this one	Fear in the Night is a very seldom discussed Hammer film with Peter Cushing and Joan Collins . It's the story of a woman recently released from the hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown . She's just been married and is about to join her husband who teaches at an all-boys school . The night before she leaves , she is attacked in her apartment . When help arrives , there is no sign of an intruder . Did she imagine the attack or did it really happen ? Soon after arriving at the school , she is attached again . No one believes her . Her husband leaves for an overnight trip to London . That night , she hears strange noises downstairs . She grabs her gun and carefully goes down the stairs . Suddenly , the lights come on and ? ? . . There's a reason this movie is so seldom discussed ? much of the movie is a complete and utter bore . A good portion of the screenplay consists of various characters walking around the school . Just walking . Nothing really happens to them . They just walk . The movie is not , though , without its good points . The finale presents a nice twist that , although fairly predictable , is well done . I can't really recommend this to anyone other than Peter Cushing or Hammer completest . For what it's worth , I give this one a .
366482	3109237	371606	5.0	" I hear some teenagers get a major rush out of stamp-collecting ! "	For my family's second official Family Movie Night , we went with Chicken Little . In the movie , Chicken Little is hit in the head and causes a great deal of panic and confusion in the town of Oakey Oak with his claim that the sky is falling . When it appears that it was nothing more than an acorn that hit Chicken Little , he becomes the laughing stock of the town . One year later , still attempting to redeem himself , fate strikes once again when Chicken Little is hit on the head . This time , however , he's got the evidence . Even so , is anyone really going to believe Chicken Little's story of an alien invasion ? Going into the movie I had read some of the negative reviews , but wasn't sure whether to believe them or not . I mean , this is Disney after all ? how bad can it be ? Well the answer is that while Chicken Little isn't the worst movie I've seen recently , it's got way too many problems to call it a winner . Calling it " mediocre " is about the best I can do . While there were a lot of problems I had with the movie , the biggest was with the plot . It just lays there ? lifeless . The movie gets off to a good start , but by the time Chicken Little wins the baseball game it becomes quickly apparent that the movie has nothing to offer . The movie's message is handled so ham-fisted that it puts a damper on the whole thing . And who decided to hire Garry Marshall to do the voice of Chicken Little's dad ? He's terrible . So I the end , as much as I enjoyed the animation , some of the set-pieces , Don Knotts , and some of the cute characters , they're not near enough to save Chicken Little from the dreaded , unexciting , and mundane rating . And for what it's worth , I'm not sure the movie did much better with my 5 year-old . If he likes a movie , he'll usually watch it again as soon as possible . It's been almost three days now and we've had no mention of a re-watch . Instead , he's back to watching Surf's Up .
366679	3109237	64175	5.0	Okay , but nothing special	I've wanted to see Boot Hill for a while now , but it's been difficult to find a watchable transfer . I realize now that I haven't been missing much . For the most part , the film is standard Spaghetti Western stuff . A group of claim jumpers , lead by Honey Fisher ( Victor Buono ) , have everyone in a small mining town under their control . Eventually , though , one of the townsfolk gets tired of being robbed and asks for the help of his friend , Cat Stevens ( Terence Hill ) . Using a traveling circus as cover , Stevens is able to get into town unnoticed for a final showdown with Fisher and his gang of thugs . Other than the use of the circus , the plot and action in Boot Hill aren't as original or as good as you'll find in some other films of this type . The final showdown is predictable and lacks any real tension . When Stevens finally meets up with Finch , the head bad guy , nothing much happens . Although most of the film is played straight , there are a few attempts at humor that feel out of place . For the most part , the acting is decent , but it's nothing to write home about . Hill , Bud Spencer , and Woody Strode are okay , but it's nothing special . The exception is Buono who is by far the standout in the film . Unfortunately , his screen time is limited and he doesn't even appear until the movie is half over . Where Boot Hill excels and what makes it unique are the directorial and editing decisions made with the film . There are a number of instances where scenes of violence are quickly spliced with scenes of the circus . Gunfight ? a clown playing a trumpet ? a man gets shot ? a trapeze act ? hiding in a barn ? dancing girls . It's a nice touch . Finally , whether intentional or not , Boot Hill features several scenes that can best be described as homosexual in nature . From the miners dancing check-to-check in the opening to Bud Spencer calling the tall , blond , good looking cowboy he lives with " Baby Doll " to the unexplained relationship between Woody Strode and the young , good looking trapeze artist , there's an undeniable homoerotic feel underlying a lot of the movie .
366600	3109237	67367	5.0	I wish Hammer had made more films with Yutte !	Lust for a Vampire is the second of Hammer's Karnstein films . While the first , The Vampire Lovers , was far from being great , it is a much better movie than this , the first sequel . The acting is weak , the male lead is very unsympathetic , Mike Raven comes across as a Christopher Lee wannabe , the sets are " too clean " , and the plot is incredibly predictable . In all honesty , I've probably rated Lust for a Vampire too high . Other than a few good set pieces and Yutte Stensgaard , it's really doesn't have much going for it . Set Pieces ? The scene of Carmilla's resurrection may be one of my favorites from any Hammer movie . It's a wonderful mix of blood , nudity , and some Satanic mumbo-jumbo . The sight of the half-naked Carmilla literally covered in blood is not one that is easily forgotten . Yutte Stensgaard ? The best word I can think of to describe Stensgaard is " stunning " . If she's in a scene , I defy anyone ( at least any male ) to not focus on her . She may not have been much of an actress , but as far as eye-candy goes , she's hard to beat .
366526	3109237	58007	5.0	Why the need for a fake beard ?	Devil Doll is one of those movies that , while it will never be confused with a masterpiece of horror , is effective in its on little way . Though the story is often predictable , it's creepy enough to provide a few chills along the way ? not scary , just creepy . Ventriloquist dummies like Hugo have always given me the heebie-jeebies and when you give them a soul , a mind of their own , and the ability to move ( not to mention a knife ) , it's the stuff of nightmares as far as I'm concerned . Finally , in the case of Devil Doll , the ending really works as the villainous Great Vorelli gets what he deserves . Though nowhere near as effective as the ending of Freaks , it's very reminiscent of that film's finale . On the downside , Devil Doll would have probably worked better at 60 minutes instead of 81 . Not that there's an abundance of obvious padding , but there's hardly enough material to fill the extra 20 minutes . The acting is nothing to write home about . While Bryant Haliday is effectively villainous , William Sylvester is a complete bore as the film's hero . One thing that I really don't understand is the need for Vorelli to wear the fake beard . I mean no one was chasing him so why the need for a disguise ? It's not really a criticism , just an odd observation . Lastly , it would have helped Devil Doll had the script given Yvonne Romain a little more to do . Her talents are wasted walking around in a trance for most of the movie . Devil Doll is another of those films that I've seen both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary . And while I enjoy the movie on its own , it makes for a really good MST3K episode . Some very funny riffs and some solid host segments . I'll rate the movie a but give it a on my MST3k rating scale .
365981	3109237	66561	5.0	" Akita ! "	I may be the only person alive who has seen both One Million Years B . C . and When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth that actually prefers the sequel to the original . Not that either is something I would recommend very highly , but at least there's a sense of goofiness about When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth that's not present in the overly serious Raquel Welch film . When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth also features a bevy of scantily clad cave women ( could Victori Vetri fill out a bikini or what ? ) , stop-motion dinosaurs that almost outdo the ones from Harryhausen , and a few nice action sequences . Based on my rating there's obviously a flip-side . The negatives for me include too much dialogue ( in a made-up language no less that's completely impossible to follow ) , an overly involved plot ( at least overly involved given the lack of language ) , and too much caveman butt . The language business actually had me laughing a couple of times . Apparently neither the cavemen nor the screenwriters could agree on what certain words meant . " Akita " appears to have meant anything from let's go over there to I really like you to your ham sandwich is ready ! Unintentionally , it's hysterical ( and distracting ) . In the end , I can't in good conscious rate When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth any better than a ? not the best movie in the world but worth seeking out if you're a fan of either this kind of dinosaur movie or a Hammer completist .
366805	3109237	46213	5.0	" Anymore guff out of you and I'll turn you over my knee and spank you . "	The plot of Project Moon Base is fairly simple ? Colonel Briteis is selected to pilot a rocket on a lunar orbit in preparation of an upcoming lunar landing . It's simple enough until it is discovered that an enemy agent is on board with intentions of sabotaging the mission . So whether their superiors like it or not , Colonel Briteis and Major Moore aren't going to be able to complete their mission . They're going to have to try to land on the moon . Many of the comments you'll see on Project Moon Base focus a lot of attention on the movie's treatment or portrayal of women . Is the movie sexist ? Those who argue against it mention Colonel Briteis ' ( Briteis is a female ) position on the space voyage or the fact that the President is a woman . Well so what ? Project Moon Base is as sexist as they come . I pointed out some of the sexist comments in Rocketship X-M and that movie's got nothing on Project Moon Base . From the intentional mispronunciation of Colonel Briteis name ( Bright Eyes ? yeah , right ) to General Greene's threat to give Briteis a spanking to Briteis ' incapability of fixing the radio after several hours of trying when Major Moore is able to do it in mere seconds ? it's about as sexist as I've seen . Sure , it was made in a different time , so don't take my comments as a slam . I'm just pointing out the facts as I see them . Two things I'm glad to have discovered about Project Moon Base . First , the movie was originally meant to be a television serial . That goes a long way to explaining some of the disjointed scenes and fragmented story lines . Second , many of the props and costumes were also used in Cat Women of the Moon . I thought they seemed awfully familiar . Glad to know I'm not going crazy . Overall , Project Moon Base is a fairly dull programmer with little to hold the attention of the viewer . There aren't any real action scenes and any suspense or drama never materializes . Even by 1953 standards , the special effects had to feel weak and not awfully convincing . Finally , much of the plot is handled rather awkwardly . The notion of an enemy agent infiltration the space program might have been interesting , but here it comes off as just too stupid for words . As is the case with many of the films I watch , there is another hand . So , on the other hand , Project Moon Base is too enjoyable despite the numerous flaws for me to rate it as a stinker . Donna Martell gives Colonel Briteis an infectious nature that's hard not to enjoy . She's a pleasure to watch . Some of the goofy sight gags are almost charming in their naïveté . Take the scenes on the space station where people walk on the ceiling or the chairs on the wall . Stupid , sure ? but fun nonetheless . Finally , there's a real innocence to most everything in Project Moon Base that's often sorely missing from today's movies that I can appreciate . Take the ending of the film where Colonel Briteis is forced to marry Major Bill Moore so people won't talk . And , even though the attitudes of the filmmakers may have been chauvinistic , most of it is harmless enough . Maybe I'm living in the past , but I sort of enjoyed Project Moon Base .
366907	3109237	42039	5.0	Too unbelievable for me to enjoy completely	I didn't think it was possible for Otto Preminger and Gene Tierney to make something this un-extraordinary . Preminger does a decent job with the direction , the acting ( other than Richard Conte who comes across as a stiff ) is fine , and the movie looks good . So what went wrong ? The plot has so many points that stretch believability to the limit that I couldn't ever " get into " Whirlpool . There's too much of that psycho-mumbo-jumbo that really annoys me . What I know about hypnosis wouldn't fill a thimble , but I simply refuse to believe it's possible to use in the manner presented in this film . Without a strong grounding in reality as I understand it , an otherwise normal film about a murder isn't believable . I would love to go into more detail , but I don't want to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it . Just trust me when I say that what Jose Ferrar's character is capable of is as far-fetched as any fantasy film I've seen .
366056	3109237	42179	5.0	Wee Willie Davis vs . Tor Johnson	In Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion , Bud and Lou head to Algieria to find a wrestler named Abdullah who left them high and dry and owing a mobster quite a bit of money . Once there , the boys get mixed up with Sheik Hamud El Khalid ( Douglas Dumbrille ) and draw his ire at a slave auction . In their attempt to escape , Bud and Lou inadvertently sign-up for the French Foreign Legion . Things only get worse when they learn that their Sergeant is in cahoots with the Sheik . Now how are they going to get back to Brooklyn ? As a general rule , I'm a fan of A & C . Some of their movies ( like Who Done It ? , Hold that Ghost , and A & C Meet Frankenstein ) I consider to be true classics . Unfortunately , by the time the boys made A & C in the Foreign Legion , much of their comedy had started to get tired and old . The movie has a " been there , done that " feel to a lot of it . For example , the " Oui vs . We " bit reminds me of several of A & C's more classic routines . Or take a look at the scene with the fish and the false teeth . To me , it shows how desperate the boys were . It's completely ridiculous and not in the least bit funny . A solid cast , however , almost makes this movie worthwhile . Douglas Dumbrille and Patricia Medina are a lot of fun . However , even though I think Dumbrille makes for a perfect villain , he's about as Algerian as I am ( which is none ) . Finally , one thing I really enjoyed about A & C in the Foreign Legion was the chance to see some classic , old-school wrestlers . Wee Willie Davis vs . Tor Johnson ! How cool is that ?
366827	3109237	75834	6.0	A tragic life - A tragic death	Based on a true story from 1930 , The Pyjama Girl Case is a difficult movie to categorize . It is more often than not considered an Italian Giallo , but is it really a Giallo ? Even though I've included it on my Top 50 Giallo list , The Pyjama Girl Case differs so much from the model that I'm not sure this label is accurate . There is no black-gloved , masked killer . There is no string of over-the-top murders . The Pyjama Girl Case lacks the stylish look of most Gialli . And , there is no sense of dread or real tension usually associated with the genre . So , why do I include The Pyjama Girl Case on my list of favorite Gialli ? this is not a good answer , but I do it because everyone else does . If it's not a real Giallo , then what is The Pyjama Girl Case ? I would say it best fits in the drama category with touches of a police procedural thrown in for good measure . The Pyjama Girl Case is the story of a mysterious half-burned body found in an abandoned car on a beach . In addition to being burned , the body also shows signs of severe head trauma and a bullet through the neck . The case is particularly interesting to Inspector Thompson ( Ray Milland ) , a retired detective wanting one last case to investigate . Using outdated techniques and very few clues , he is determined to find the killer before he rides off into the sunset . I disagree with a lot of what I've read and feel Milland is one of the films weak points . His crotchety old man routine is rather predictable . His Inspector Thompson is the cliché for the " non-conforming just because I'm old " type character . The Pyjama Girl Case's structure can be off-putting to some . In addition to the police investigation , the film also features a concurrent look at the events leading up to the girl's death . It can be confusing at first because of the uncertainty of what's going on , who these people are , and how they relate to each other . But everything works out in the end and all the pieces fall into place . The girl's story is a tragic one . Her life is a series of miserable events ( a bad marriage , a miscarriage , a string of unfulfilling relationships , etc . ) all leading to her brutal murder . The girl is played by Dallia Di Lazzaro in a very memorable and believable performance . She gives her character a sense of depth not often found in Italian movies of this sort . She is easily the highlight of the movie for me .
366887	3109237	87759	6.0	" You've got to grit your teeth and dance , even when a friend dies . "	For those Lucio Fulci fans who only know him for his films like Zombi 2 or The New York Ripper , I can easily see how Murder Rock could come as something of a shock and disappointment . It has more in common with his film One on Top of the Other than it does the throat-gashing , chest-ripping , eye-gouging films Fulci is famous for . Murder Rock is virtually bloodless . It's odd that during the early to mid-80s , which are arguably Fulci's most violent and lurid period as a filmmaker , he reverted to a relatively tame film like Murder Rock . That's not to say Murder Rock isn't enjoyable . There are enough Giallo elements in the plot involving a series of murders at a New York arts academy that I was reasonably entertained throughout . Murder Rock plays it straight and doesn't bring up some vital piece of information or suspect in the last minute that can sometimes make these films frustrating . However , and I realize that I may sound like I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too , but it's this straightforward approach that is also the film's biggest weakness . It was far too easy for me to spot " who done it " . There are red herrings , but all of them are easily dismissed . I kept waiting for a plot twist that never materialized . One area where Murder Rock excels is in its look . Fulci created a highly stylized world to set this Giallo . There are some interesting camera angles down corridors and through doorways that add a lot of suspense to the film . I was at first put-off by the lighting Fulci used in much of Murder Rock . I began to wonder if all of New York was lit by a slow pulsing strobe . But then I realized how effective this lighting was to Fulci telling his story . A lot can happen in the total darkness between the blinding flashes of light . Technically , I would rate Murder Rock as one of Fulci's best films . Finally , a lot of the reviews I've read on Murder Rock tend to over-focus on the soundtrack . Sure , it's cheesy , outdated , and , at times , inappropriate . I won't deny that . At one point in the movie , I half expected to see Irene Cara pop up to do a song or two . But you've got to consider the timeframe this movie was made . Fame and Flashdance were very popular and Fulci was trying to cash-in on their success . And in that light , I think he was somewhat successful . Keith Emerson's score is a reasonable representation of the music used in movies of this type in the early 80s . Like it or not , it fits the film . I really wouldn't want to change any of it .
366316	3109237	32819	6.0	" I'll never go on a case like this again without a gat . "	On his way to a police convention in New York , Charlie Chan runs into an old friend from Scotland Yard , Hugh Drake . Drake , now employed by military intelligence , is hot on the heels of a saboteur named Paul Narvo . Drake asks Chan to pay him a visit while he's in New York to talk over his case . Chan makes the visit only to find that his colleague has been murdered . If you look through my reviews , it should become apparent that I'm a fan of Charlie Chan . That's why it pains me to admit that I don't really care for Murder Over New York as much as most other fans seem to . Part of the problem is the whole WWII spy angle . I've never much cared for this type of plot when watching a Chan film . I should also point out that I have the same problem with the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films that deal with WWII espionage . I'd much rather see my favorite film detectives solving murders than chasing spies . Beyond my issues with the plot , I've always had a real problem the solution to the case . There is no way that the audience could hope to play along with Chan and come up with a solution . The movie cheats far too much . There is information known only to Chan that comes up after the killer is identified . All I ask is that movies of this type play fair . From my rating , it's probably obvious that even with the problems I have with the film , I still enjoy it . I mean it's still Charlie Chan after all . Sidney Toler is as enjoyable as ever . Victor Sen Yung is as good , if not better ( meaning less annoying ) , than in some of the previous installments . The rest of the cast is more than serviceable with a fun cameo from Shemp Howard . Like all the other Chan films , this one looks much better than it should . The cinematography is solid . Finally , considering all the problems I pointed out that I have with Murder Over New York , it's a bit odd that I've probably seen it more than any other Charlie Chan film . That's got to count for something .
365910	3109237	67713	6.0	" He is evil . He is the embodiment of all that is evil . He is the very Devil himself . "	When Paul Carlson ( Christopher Matthews ) goes missing , his brother Simon ( Dennis Waterman ) and friend Sarah Framsen ( Jenny Hanley ) trace his footsteps to try to find him . Their journey leads them to a small village full of inhospitable locals who will only tell the pair that Paul was last seen heading toward a nearby castle . Simon and Sarah set off for the castle unaware of the danger that awaits them . This is no ordinary castle . It's the home of Dracula . Simon and Sarah find themselves in a fight for their lives against the King of the Vampires . Of Hammer's long list of Dracula films , Scars of Dracula is about average . It's nowhere near as good as Horror of Dracula , but it's a long way from being as bad as The Satanic Rites of Dracula . It's impossible to begin discussing any of Hammer's Dracula films without first mentioning Christopher Lee . In Scars of Dracula , Lee plays a more sadistic and evil version of the Count . In addition to the normal blood-sucking , this Dracula is not above the routine tortures of beating his servant with a whip , hanging a body from a wall , or sending his legions of bats to all but wipe out a town . It's these scenes that really make the film standout . But as much as I enjoyed the character of Dracula , as blasphemous as this will sound , it's one of Lee's weaker performances . Maybe I was reading something into his performance that wasn't there , but he came across as incredibly uninterested ( which in reality he was ) . There's none of the menace in the eyes that I associate with Lee's Dracula . It's acting by-the-numbers as far as I could tell . It's unfortunately because Lee was always so good in the role . Other highlights for me include Jenny Hanley as Sarah and the wall climbing scene . Hanley seemed like such a natural as the innocent , fragile Sarah . And she has some of the most expressive eyes I've noticed in a Hammer heroine . It's too bad she didn't make more films for Hammer . As for the wall climbing scenes , I believe it's the only one of its kind in any of the Hammer Dracula films . I realize that it's all done with camera tricks , but seeing Lee's Dracula climbing the side of the castle was a real treat . Unfortunately , I found just as many negatives as I did positives in Scars of Dracula . First , the screenplay has a number of holes in it . All of the characters make it incredibly convenient for Dracula . Not once is Dracula forced to leave his castle to find a victim ? they all conveniently come to him . And just how did Sarah get to the castle so fast ? The same journey that took Simon and a local priest almost an entire day is covered by the distraught Sarah in a matter of what seems to be a couple of hours . Next , Simon and Paul felt too modern given the time period in which the film is set . Their mannerisms , speech , and look simply scream 1970 . Finally , in the beginning of the film , Dracula is resurrected by a rubber bat drooling blood over his remains . If it's that easy for Dracula to come back to life , why didn't he use this method more often ? Why go through all the hassle of a séance as in Dracula A . D . 1972 or the elaborate ceremony in Taste the Blood of Dracula ? I seems like a lot of wasted effort to me .
366654	3109237	70039	6.0	Head-in-a-Box	Centuries ago , Aleric du Marnac ( Paul Naschy ) and his female companion were put to death for a variety of crimes including consorting with Satan . The pair vowed to get their revenge on the descendants of those responsible for their deaths . du Marnac was beheaded and his body and head were buried separately . Switch to the present day ( 1973 ) where Hugo du Marnac ( also Paul Nashcy ) and his friends discover a buried chest containing the head of Aleric du Marnac ? a head that wants to be reunited with the rest of its body . Through possession and blood sacrifice , du Marnac is determined to make his body whole . What Works : - The Last Act . I have yet to see a Paul Naschy film that I can wholeheartedly endorse , but Horror Rises from the Tomb comes as close as I've yet seen . The final third of the movie is a nice slice of Euro-horror . It's loaded with lots of juicy horror elements - a reanimated head , a sickle-welding maniac , zombies , a magical talisman , and more . If only the first two-thirds of the movie could have been this good . It's not that the first part of the movie is bad , it's just not as good as the final half hour . - The Head-in-a-Box . Horror Rises from the Tomb certainly isn't the first film of its type to have a reanimated head , but its definitely handled better than most . Through some nice editing and some tricky camera placements , du Marnac's head comes to life . In fact , most of the special effects ( the zombies rising from the swamp or the heart being ripped from the chest are two more examples ) are as good as anything I've seen form an early 70s Spanish horror movie . - Helga Line . du Marnac's twisted , blood-thirsty female companion is played to perfection by Helga Line . What Doesn't Work : - Paul Naschy . I've written this before , but I just don't understand Nashcy's status as a cult icon . He's one of the most unappealing actors I've ever seen . As the descendant Hugo , Nashcy lacks anything approaching charisma . - Dialogue . This may have as much to do with the dubbing as anything else , but some of the dialogue had me going back to see if I had heard things correctly . The best example goes something like this ( I don't have the exact quote , but this is close ) : " Two people have been murdered and we've just dumped their bodies in the lake . We've got to get out of here . We don't want to get involved . " Huh ? I've come to realize that Naschy's brand of horror may not be for me . I'll still watch his films in hopes that one day I'll see in him what so many other horror fans have seen . Horror Rises from the Tomb may not be Naschy's breakthrough with me , but it's a movie that I enjoyed and will revisit in the future .
366115	3109237	64747	6.0	With Lee and Price , it could have been better	The Oblong Box is an average horror film - not great , but certainly not the worst . The story is fairly interesting and the cast ( while not necessarily the acting ) is top notch . Horror icons Vincent Price and Christopher Lee star . The story involves a man who is kept locked in his room . He has been horribly disfigured during an African voodoo ceremony and , as a result , has gone completely mad . After faking his death , he seeks revenge on those he feels are responsible for his condition . For the most part , the story kept me interested . There are enough twists and turns that keep it from becoming overly slow or boring . The main weakness with the story is that it is unnecessarily complicated . A more straight forward approach may have been more effective . The period costumes and sets are good . There is more blood than in the normal Vincent Price / AIP movie ( even though it is what I refer to as the bright red " Hammer blood " ) . The supporting cast is quite good . I especially enjoyed watching the young Hilary Dwyer as Price's wife . As I said earlier , Price and Lee star . Neither is , however , particularly good in this movie . In fact , I think anyone could have played the role Lee plays . It's not a particularly difficult or meaty role . Both appear to be going through the motions . The real star is Alister Williamson , playing Price's disfigured brother . Not only does he have the most screen time , he is more effective in his role than either Lee or Price .
366714	3109237	26000	6.0	A nice start for the Stooges at Columbia	Woman Haters is far from the best of the Three Stooges , but it is a nice start to the Columbia shorts and does offer a unique and interesting thing or two . The plot sees the boys joining the Woman Haters Club ? a club that prohibits its members from carrying on with women . But no sooner than they become members , Larry ( they actually have character names , but they don't really matter ) finds himself at the altar . He does his best to keep Moe and Curly from finding out he's secretly gotten married and he does his best to keep his new wife from finding out about the Woman Haters club . As expected , a great deal of eye poking and head knocking ensues . The two best things Woman Haters has going for it ( beyond its curiosity value ) is the rhyming scheme of the dialogue and Marjorie White as Larry's wife . While I've seen some complaints about the rhyming dialogue , it worked for me . I thought it was very clever . Now , it might not have worked for a full feature , but for a two-reeler , it's okay . As for Marjorie White , she more than capable of holding her own with Moe , Larry , and Curly ? more so than most women I can think of off the top of my head who appeared in other Three Stooges shorts . It's too bad she didn't live long enough to see where her career might have taken her .
366560	3109237	699412	6.0	Nice introduction to the series	" The Case of the Cunningham Heritage " is a nice introduction to the 1954 series creatively titled Sherlock Holmes . Ronald Howard plays Holmes and Howard Marion-Crawford is Watson . Both are more than adequate in their roles and present a nice change of pace for viewers more familiar with either the Rathbone films or the Brett television series . Howard gives Holmes a bit more humanity ( for lack of a better word ) than I've seen elsewhere . As for Crawford , fortunately he doesn't play Watson as the bumbling fool as Nigel Bruce often did . The pair is very capably joined by Archie Duncan as Inspector Lastrade . The Lastrade role is much larger than what's often found , but the character makes a nice foil for Holmes . Being the first episode , " The Case of the Cunningham Heritage " is more concerned with character development than anything else . There's a murder , but it's hardly worth going into . The murder and its solution are ancillary to the viewer getting a feel for the characters . I , for one , appreciated this aspect of the episode . It sets a solid foundation for future installments . And , at less than 30 minutes in length , there's not much time for an overly involved mystery anyway . Overall , not a bad way to get things started . I think a is about right for this episode . I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series .
366693	3109237	67321	6.0	Better than its reputation suggests	- The movie begins with Dr . Frankenstein buying a corpse from a grave-robber to use in his experiments . His daughter's arrival puts a kink in his plans , but he forges on in his quest to create life . When his monster does come to life , it immediately attacks and kills the good Doctor . Tania ( the daughter ) is also a doctor and wants to carry-on with her father's experiments . So , while the original monster terrorizes the community , Tania hatches a plan to take the brain from Marshall , the lab assistant , and place it into the hunky ( Did I just use that word ? ) body of a retarded servant . Will she succeed ? - What's not to like about a Frankenstein movie where the basis of creating life is sex ? Tania doesn't get all philosophical on us and start babbling about discovering the origins of life and the secrets of God . Sure , Tania wants to see her father's reputation restored by proving his theories , but she also wants to create the ultimate lover and isn't afraid to say so . It's as good a reason as any I've heard in a movie for creating a monster . - I've always thought that Lady Frankenstein was better than its reputation suggests . Oh , it's got problems , but I always have fun watching it . Lady Frankenstein comes across to me as an Italian Hammer-style film - rich , vibrant colors , nice Gothic touches , attention to details , and a lot of fake looking blood . The cast consists of a who's who of Euro regulars . Joseph Cotten , Rosalba Neri , Paul Muller , and even Mickey Hargitay give performances that are as good as most any other Italian horror film of the period . I also like the references to the old Universal film that can be found in Lady Frankenstein . For example , Dr . Frankenstein's line about man being God on earth takes Colin Clive's speech from the original Frankenstein to a whole new level .
366116	3109237	38129	6.0	A nice little poverty row thriller	Strangler of the Swamp is a surprisingly nice little poverty row thriller from PRC . While many of today's horror fans would find little to frighten , it's a wonderful example of creating atmosphere on a VERY limited budget . The movie concerns the ghost of a ferryman , seeking revenge for being unjustly hanged . He's out to get those who ' done him wrong ' . My biggest problem with the story is that it gets away from the spooky swamp too often in favor of a love story . Had the movie concentrated more on the Strangler and the creepy swamp and less on the love story , Strangler of the Swamp would have been much better . The direction of Frank Wisbar is tight and he gets the most out of the limited funding he was given . One final note , the movie stars Blake Edwards ( of Pink Panther fame ) in an early role . Not the best , but better than many of the films PRC was cranking out in the 40s .
366385	3109237	235681	6.0	An unforgivable cheat	Going into a plot summary is a bit tricky with one of these Poirot mysteries . It's difficult to do so without giving away too much . It's hard to know where to stop . I'll just say that in typical Agatha Christie style , there is no shortage of suspects , everyone has a motive , and the victim was so nasty that he almost deserved what he got . Sound familiar ? If it weren't for one key incident in the movie , I would be happy extolling all of the positive aspects of Lord Edwige Dies . I'm sure I would mention the authentic looking sets ( at least , authentic to my untrained eye ) , the attention to detail , the acting , the score , and all of the other aspects that make each and every Poirot installment I've seen special . I'm also sure that I would go out of my way to mention Helen Grace who affected me much in the same manner she did Poirot . And , I'm sure there are other positives I would not doubt list . But , because of an unforgivable flaw , I cannot be positive while writing this . If you don't want to read possible SPOILERS , please skip the rest of this review . SPOILER WARNING Lord Edwige Dies contains one of the biggest cheats I've ever seen . The whole solution to the mystery revolves around Jane Wilkinson being in two places at the same time . It's not physically possible . So , in the solution to the mystery , we see that Jane asked a friend gifted in impersonations to " play " her at a dinner party as part of a joke . The other guests hardly know her so the actress should be able to pull it off . I'm okay with this , but the director commits an unforgivable cheat with the dinner party scene . The Jane Wilkinson we see as an audience at the dinner part is the real Jane Wilkinson . It's not the impostor . Trust me , I went back just to make sure . I cannot believe any director would have thought he could get away with something like this . END SPOILER
366198	3109237	124298	7.0	Harmless Fun	Thirty some years ago , a couple entered their bomb shelter because they thought the Russians were bombing California . They have a son while underground and he grows up only knowing life inside the shelter . It is now 1999 and the family is running out of supplies . The son must venture into the world above to gather the necessities his family needs to survive . Blast from the Past is definitely not the kind of movie I usually go for . But it has a certain charm that I found refreshing and enjoyable . It's harmless fun . While there's not much that is laugh-out-loud funny , several moments brought a smile to my face . Brendan Fraser plays the son to wide-eyed innocent perfection . He makes believable a totally ridiculous situation . The rest of the cast is quite good with memorable performances from Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek as the couple from the 60s . Their demeanor , language , and actions were totally believable .
366323	3109237	75913	7.0	" Hey , hot shot . We're out of food . "	I am so glad I finally had the chance to see Day of the Animals . I've been a fan of William Girdler's Grizzly as long as I can remember . But for whatever reason , I had never seen his follow-up . So , did it meet my expectations ? While I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Grizzly , it's still a fun ride for anyone with a taste for these animal attack movies . In this one , a varied bunch of would-be backpackers is helicoptered to the top of a mountain . The plan is to take a couple of weeks and hike down the mountain and out of the woods . Leading the hikers is experienced guide Steve Buckner ( Christopher George ) . The rest of the group is made up of varied individuals including a boy and his overly protective mother , a couple trying to reconcile their marriage , a professor , a reporter , and an advertising executive . Things get off to a good start , but unbeknownst to the group , there's trouble brewing . It seems that ozone depletion is having a very negative effect on the animals at higher altitudes . The " negative effect " is the animals have all turned into killing machines with man as their prey . Can this band of novices make it out of the woods before they become victims ? Man , do I love this kind of movie ! It plays out something like a bizarre episode of The Love Boat with killer animals at every turn . But even I realize that Day of the Animals might not be for everyone . If you don't want to watch a band of ill-equipped , ill-prepared 70s types walking and talking their way through the forest , you might want to skip it . The actual animal attacks , while acceptable , are standard 70s movie stuff ? nothing overly special or groundbreaking about them . The tension and atmosphere is also standard for a 70s animal attack movie . A shot of the people ? a shot of the animal ? another shot of the people ? a shot of the animal getting closer to the people . If you've seen it once , you've seen it a million times . Fortunately for me , I get a real kick out of this kind of cheese . But the best part of the movie has to be the performance of Leslie Nielsen . It has to be the most over-the-top piece of acting I've ever been fortunate enough to see . You could look far and wide and not find anything that comes close to the scene-chewing on display in Day of the Animals . A friend of mine wrote the he almost gave the movie a based solely on Nielsen performance . I've gotta agree with that . He's that amazing !
366074	3109237	72260	7.0	Not like any teacher I ever had	I can't believe how much fun I had watching The Teacher . They don't make ' em like this anymore . Having recently graduated from high school , 18 year-old Sean ( Jay North ) has one last summer at home before he heads to college . He discovers quite the novel way to spend his time ? he begins having an affair with his 28 year-old blond knock-out of a teacher , Diane Marshall ( Angel Tompkins ) . Things would be great for the couple if it weren't for a crazed Vietnam veteran named Ralph ( Anthony James ) who not only has the hots for Diane , but also blames Sean for his brother's death . Sean's had enough and decides to confront Ralph ? whatever the consequences . The Teacher is 1970s sleazy , grimy , soft-core film-making at its best . Writer / director Howard Avedis handles the plot with the casual style you would expect in the free-love 70s when 18 year-olds were treated like adults . The acting is surprisingly strong . Jay North and Angel Tompkins give much better performances than I would have expected . Tompkins is a real revelation to me and I look forward to discovering more of her work . Veteran character actor Anthony James literally steals every scene in which he appears . Avedis mixes in just enough sex , sleaze , and thrills to keep the whole thing interesting throughout . Finally , I've read complaints on the internet about the films ending . Well , I loved it . It really caught me off guard . Sure , it's as melodramatic and , ultimately , cheesy as they come - but that's what works for me . I wouldn't want The Teacher to have ended any other way .
366199	3109237	37453	7.0	Lon Chaney , Jr . - The Love God	While doing field research , Professor Norman Reed ( Lon Chaney , Jr . ) meets and falls in love with a beautiful , exotic woman . He marries her and brings her home . Things couldn't be any better for the Professor . That is , until he discovers his wife is still practicing the voodoo type ceremonies of her homeland . He forbids her from carrying on with the superstitious mumbo-jumbo . But at what price ? Professor Reed's life is suddenly turned upside-down and he faces the ultimate ? a charge of murder . Is it the voodoo or something more close to home but equally sinister that threatens Professor Reed's future ? Of the six Inner Sanctum mysteries , Weird Woman is one of my favorites ( Pillow of Death being the other ) . I suppose some who've seen the movie might think I've overrated it , but these kinds of movies work for me . Weird Woman is a quick-paced mystery that , at just over 60 minutes , never outstays its welcome . The " mystery " isn't really hard to figure out , but the all the back-stabbing and other trickery is a lot of fun . The cast is a blast . Besides Chaney , Weird Woman features some of the best females working in B-films of the 40s ? Anne Gwynne , Evelyn Ankers , Lois Collier , and Elizabeth Russell . Overall , I've go very few complaints . One thing that really puzzles me every time I've seen Weird Woman is the way the script has almost every female in the cast react to Chaney . Watching beautiful women like Gwynne , Ankers , and Collier swoon after Chaney is a hoot !
366088	3109237	33650	7.0	Very entertaining beginning to the Falcon series	The Gay Falcon , the first movie in the Falcon series , finds the Falcon ( George Sanders ) ready to give up both women and detective work at the request of his fiancé . This promise , however , doesn't last long as a pretty woman with a story of stolen jewelry soon walks into his life . In no time at all , the Falcon is up to his elbows in murder and hiding out from the police . The only way to clear his name is to find the real killer . This may have been George Sanders first time out in the role of the Falcon , but he wears the role with the familiarity of a favorite old sweater . I would argue , however , that his Saint series ( which ended just prior to the start of the Falcon series ) was so similar to the Falcon that it was hardly a stretch for Sanders . Regardless , Sanders makes everything seem so effortless and natural . He is joined by an especially strong cast . Gladys Jenkins , Edward Brophy , and Arthur Shields should be familiar to any fan of classic B-fare . Oddly though , all are upstaged by the strong performance of Nina Vale who surprisingly only appeared in two other films . I can't believe she didn't do more . She's quite good and imminently watchable . As for the movie , none of the Falcon movies are particularly deep affairs and The Gay Falcon is no different . It's light , breezy entertainment . The 1940s style of comedy / mystery films has always appealed to me and The Gay Falcon is a nice example . The comedy elements hit their mark and are , at their worst , amusing . Nothing to make you fall in the floor with laughter , just good , light-hearted fun . The mystery elements in the movie also work and are sufficiently convoluted to make it interesting throughout . And it helps that the final solution to the mystery at least makes sense and is ultimately satisfying . Director Irving Reis keeps things moving at an entertaining pace with no time for a wasted scene in the movie's relative short 67 minute runtime . Overall , it's a solid effort .
366689	3109237	76729	7.0	" Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty eight hours ? That ain't never been done before . "	- Back in 1977 , I was 13 years old . I suppose that I fit right into the movies target market . If I remember correctly , I saw it 4 times in the theater . Years later , I dismissed the movie as too sophomoric and beneath me . But as I grow older , I see Smokey and the Bandit for what it really is ? a nice piece of brainless fun . After all , this isn't rocket science , it's a car chase movie . - The movie works for me because it is so ridiculous . The whole idea of a Texas sheriff chasing a Trans Am all the way to Georgia is completely silly . But the car stunts , jokes , Jackie Gleason , Big & Little Enos , and even Jerry Reed's music make it a very fun watch . My biggest complaint is the way Burt Reynolds insists on mugging for the camera .
366310	3109237	837342	7.0	A solid way to start off the series	Over the years , I've seen everyone one of these Jonny Quest episodes at least a half-a-dozen times . When I was much younger , there wasn't much of anything on television as cool as Jonny Quest . It combined mysteries , monsters , and the unknown with some really groovy 60s music , and James Bond type gadgets . What boy wouldn't love this stuff ! Well , I'm not a kid anymore and it's not the 60s anymore , but I still enjoy watching Jonny Quest . Over the next few weeks , I'm going to give every episode of Jonny Quest another go round . I started this morning with the first episode , " The Mystery of the Lizard Men " . While I don't think the sight of the lizard men's hands reaching over the side of the boat affected me the way it did several decades ago , it's still a nice moment . Overall , it's a solid way to start off the series . Spooky ghost ships , the mysterious Sargasso Sea , and deadly lasers ? " The Mystery of the Lizard Men " packs a lot into its brief runtime . I don't rate this episode as highly as others because the main baddie doesn't really stand out and he's too easily defeated . Otherwise , it's an enjoyable episode . A seems about right .
366382	3109237	36349	7.0	" It's clear as mud to me . "	A British secret agent is assigned the task of taking some secret documents to Washington , D . C . It's wartime in Europe and enemy agents would be only too happy to get their hands on these papers . When the British agent does make it off the train from New York , things look bleak . Enter Sherlock Holmes and his trusty , ever faithful sidekick , Dr . Watson . The British government entrusts locating the missing agent , the secret papers he carried , and , ultimately , the success of the Allied war effort to Holmes . I've never been much of a fan of the modern day , WWII set Sherlock Holmes films . I wholeheartedly prefer the Victorian Holmes thrillers like The Scarlet Claw and The Hound of the Baskervilles to something like The Voice of Terror . Too much flag waving , blindly chasing Nazis , and gun-play for my liking . I prefer the more sedate , cerebral Holmes who analyzes clues and outsmarts the baddies . And that's probably why I found Sherlock Holmes in Washington so appealing . The movie allows Holmes to use his intellect to solve the case . Holmes analyzes a sliver of wood having to do with the case and quickly comes up with the most amazing pronouncement regarding its origin . Pure Holmes ! In addition , Sherlock Holmes in Washington benefits from having some above average supporting players ( George Zucco and Henry Daniell ) and from having Roy William Neill in the director's chair . Altogether , it's a good show and a nice installment in the series .
366624	3109237	71424	7.0	" You know what a man would do right now if he were smart ? "	Needing money to finance a racing team , Larry ( Peter Fonda ) and Deke ( Adam Roarke ) decide to hold-up a grocery store . Things are going as planned until Larry's one-night-stand , Mary ( Susan George ) , turns up in the getaway car . The three must settle their differences if they are to evade the police and make their escape . What Works : - The Stunts . Dirty Mary Crazy Larry is such a simple movie . It's the kind of movie that's best enjoyed with your bran turned off . This isn't rocket science , it's a car chase movie . The chase scenes are expertly filmed with a minimum of cuts . We see everything exactly the way it happened . And , as the film was made in 1974 , we're seeing real people perform the dangerous action and not some computer generated idea of what the stunts should look like . - The Acting . Everyone in the movie is great . Fonda and George may get top billing , but Roarke really shines . Roarke's Deke is flawed character with a lot of heart . His scene with Mary toward the end of the movie is perfectly played and unexpectedly emotional . I'm amazed that Roarke didn't go on to bigger things . - The Ending . That ending took some real guts . The movie sucks you in and makes you really care about whether or not these characters are going to make their escape . And out of nowhere comes that ending . Wow ! What Doesn't Work : - The Dialogue . Some of the dialogue reminded me of a foreign movie that has been translated into English . Some of the lines just didn't seem natural . I don't remember grown adults actually talking like that in the 70s . - Susan George's Accent . For the most part , George does a good job of covering her English accent . But there are times when it slips through and is a bit distracting . I realize that Dirty Mary Crazy Larry isn't the type of movie to appeal to everyone , but I had a blast watching it . It's the kind of entertainment I enjoy . The Region 1 DVD is fantastic with a nice documentary featuring Fonda , George , and director John Hough . The fun they had making this movie really comes through . Fonda , in particular , acts like a schoolboy as he reminisces about the movie . They appeared to have as much fun making it as I did watching it .
366598	3109237	51542	7.0	Wonderful Performance by Karloff	Corridors of Blood ( 1962 ) is the story of a doctor trying to discover the secret of painless surgery . While less a horror film and more a study of the decline in an individual caused by drug addiction , it does have several creepy and frightening moments . Some of the surgery sequences are gruesome . And , any film with both Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee has got to have its share of horror moments . The basic story - Karloff plays the doctor . He experiments on himself with the gas he is developing to be used in surgery . He becomes addicted to the narcotics he is using . Soon , he is unable to function and is released from his position as a surgeon . He meets up with a couple of baddies played by Lee and Francis De Wolff who agree to help him get the drugs he needs . All Karloff has to do is sign some blank death certificates . Revealing anymore of the story would be too much . Karloff is terrific as the doctor . You can feel his anguish and pain as he realizes what the drugs have done to him . But , you can also see the underlying need he has for the gas . Lee is so incredibly ruthless . His character ( Resurrection Joe ) kills with no remorse or qualms . This is one character I would have liked to see more of in other films . Also present is an excellent supporting cast lead by De Wolff and Nigel Green . Corridors of Blood excels at atmosphere . Even with the small budget , the director ( Robert Day ) is able to portray the seediness and depravity of the Seven Dials area . Perfect ! Not a great film , Corridors of Blood is , however , good and very watchable . Karloff's performance alone is reason enough to see this film .
366429	3109237	84719	7.0	" Overall , it was a good , efficient butchery . "	There's not much need to go into detail on the plot . Simply put , The New York Ripper is the story of a mad killer with a penchant for slashing young woman and harassing the police with his duck-like voice . That's really all you need to know . The New York Ripper is Lucio Fulci's latter day ultra-violent take on the Giallo . When I say ultra-violent , I mean ULTRA-violent . If you're a fan of Fulci-style gore , there's surely something here for you . There's one scene where a girl's eye meets a razor that's particularly nasty and particularly difficult to watch . And , if you're a fan of Fulci-style sleaze , there's surely something here for you also . While I won't go as far as some reviewers and call it pornographic , there are a variety of sexual perversions on display . But it's not all blood and sex . Fulci actually manages to create a few scenes with real tension . There are moments where you know that killer is about to strike , but the anticipation Fulci builds in the audience is quite good . Unfortunately , there are problems I have with the film . I'll limit this to two examples . First , the resolution of the mystery is a real letdown . The killer's identity is far too easy to guess . Fulci telegraphs the answer form the opening moments of the film . Second , Gialli often ask the viewer to suspend reality to accept various plot points , but the final scenes in The New York Ripper cross the line into ridiculousness and really hurts the overall film . I'm certainly no expert , but I sincerely doubt that all the psychological babble made any real sense to anyone .
366365	3109237	366292	7.0	A restrained Miike	In Takashi Miike's One Missed Call , there's really very little new ground covered . If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned , long black-haired female ghost , I feel as if I've seen a dozen . Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around , I don't know ( or really care ) . The similarities , though , are undeniable . But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie . Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death . It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films , but for the most part , it works . Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer . One of the best examples is the " ghost in the cupboard " scene . It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare , but it's very effective in generating the desired response . Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital . These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films . Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not , as usual , it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films . One Missed Call is no exception . Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting , the film has a " look " that helps create an atmosphere of dread . The special effects , both visual and sound , are well done . The acting is good . Both of the leads , Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi , are more than adequate . And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension . Overall , it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect . But One Missed Call isn't without its faults . Beyond the " been there , done that " aspects of the plot , the film's pacing could have been better . While the first and third acts are enjoyable , the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit . Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film . A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better . One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved . For example , why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital ? And could the ending have been more confusing ? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale . That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it , but don't ask me what it all meant . Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues .
366867	3109237	69141	7.0	A different type of Bava	- Four Times that Night is the story of what happened during Tina and John's first date . According to Tina , John tried to rape her and she barely escaped with her innocence intact . According to John , Tina was an insatiable wild woman he couldn't get away from . According to John's voyeuristic doorman , while John was in the bedroom having " homosexual sex " , Tina was having her own lesbian encounter . So , just what did happen ? - Mario Bava wasn't afraid to try different genres . He directed Gothic horrors ( Black Sunday ) , gialli ( Blood and Black Lace ) , sword & sandal movies ( Hercules in the Haunted World ) , westerns ( Roy Colt and Winchester Jack ) , spy movies ( Danger Diabolik ) , science fiction ( Planet of the Vampires ) , and so on . But Four Times that Night is his only " sex comedy " . Bava called it his " blue movie " . While it may have represented a departure for Bava , you can clearly see his trademark style all over the movie . Everything from the bright , rich colors to the camera zooms screams Bava . - While I enjoyed the movie , it's far from being my favorite thing that Bava ever made . It is interesting to see how different people's perceptions are given the same set of events . In the fourth segment of the film , we get to see what really happened . And , as is often the case , reality can't match the sensationalism that our imaginations can dream up . - Much of my enjoyment in the movie comes from the casting of John and Tina . Bret Halsey and Daniela Giordano are simply perfect in their roles . They are very believable even in the most absurd situations .
366240	3109237	51406	7.0	" I may sound like a lunatic , but I'm not crazy ! "	Gillian Holroyd ( Kim Novak ) is a witch . Secretly , she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson ( James Stewart ) . She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her . Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man . She decides to tell him her secret . But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was " tricked " into falling in love with Gillian ? As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go , Bell Book and Candle is good , but nothing spectacular . It's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it . Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread . The movie's cute , funny at times , and touching in the end . Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry . Novak ( as others have pointed out ) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way . The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon , Hermione Gingold , and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart . The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be . Is it a screwball comedy ? Is it a romantic comedy ? Is it a supernatural comedy ? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach , the movie might have been even better and more memorable .
366643	3109237	70698	7.0	" I saw a murder , and I'm going to prove it ! "	Sisters is a very well made low-budget thriller form Brian De Palma with a few very shocking moments and , unfortunately , a couple of serious flaws that keep me from rating it any higher . The basic premise of the psychological impact of being separated Siamese twins is , as far as I know , rather unique . De Palma handles this portion very well and in a believable manner . In lesser hands , Sisters might have disintegrated into the ridiculous psycho-babble I've heard once too often . As for shocking moments , the main murder in the film is rather unexpected and caught me off-guard in its viciousness . The low-budget special effects only add to the brutality of the images on screen . De Palma also creates a dream sequence near the end of the film that is beautiful and disturbing at the same time . The acting in Sisters is at least adequate with Margot Kidder giving a standout performance . The great Bernard Herrmann contributes a wonderful score . But , as I mentioned , there are a couple of moments that do not work at all . The first is the reporter who " witnesses " the murder . From her vantage point , all she sees is a hand writing something in what appears to be blood on a window . In addition , there's such glare on the window that there is no way she couldn't have seen a whole lot more . Yet she tells the police that she " witnessed " a murder and that the victim was a black man . What ? She never saw any of that . My second problem with the movie comes near the end and is part of the dream sequence I mentioned previously . Exposition is fine as long as it's interwoven into the action going on screen . Having characters stop and explain what's going on so the viewer knows what they're seeing can drag a movie to a standstill . And when this type of exposition occurs during the climax of a film , it's unforgivable . During the build-up to the climax are scenes of one character basically telling another what the audience is watching . Maybe I'm being picky , but it really bothered me and hurt the flow of the third act .
366873	3109237	66849	7.0	Criminally Underseen	- While plowing a field , a young man uncovers what he believes to be the devil . Soon , all the children and young people in the tiny village are performing pagan rituals in the woods . Very nice movie . - Blood on Satan's Claw is loaded with that key ingredient : ATMOSPHERE . Good acting by a cast of British horror regulars , although none are very well known . Linda Hayden is just so deliciously evil as the leader of the cult . It's too bad the movie didn't feature a " big " name actor . Blood on Satan's Claw would probably get the attention it deserves if it had . The ending was the only let down as far as I'm concerned . - With a decent DVD transfer , my overall enjoyment of the movie might actually increase . The copy I have is a very old VHS that I bought used at a video store .
366119	3109237	69048	7.0	Underrated Bava	While I prefer Bava's Black Sunday and Kill Baby . . . Kill , this is a good movie that I would highly recommend . Baron Blood combines the best elements of a good old-time ghost / haunted house story with a modern day slasher film . All of Bava's trademarks are here - imaginative lighting , wonderful sets , and dramatic locations . Combined , they create the perfect horror movie atmosphere . Unfortunately , another Bava trademark is here as well - a weak script . There are some plot holes big enough the drive the Baron's castle through . But with Bava's style and skill as a director , the plot problems seem very minor . The film concerns the evil Baron Otto von Kleist . After having been brought back to life , he continues the murderous ways of the past . There are some truly frightening moments in the film . ( I'm not talking just creepy , I mean downright scary . ) Examples would include the scenes involving the summoning of the Baron or Elke Sommer running from the Baron through the dark streets . Speaking of the chase scene , films like Halloween or Friday the 13th were obviously heavily influenced by this movie . One could easily envision either Michael or Jason chasing Elke through the foggy streets .
366042	3109237	93177	7.0	Good , just not great	- ( From IMDb ) Clive Barker's feature directing debut graphically depicts the tale of a man and wife who move into an old house and discover a hideous creature - the man's half-brother , who is also the woman's former lover - hiding upstairs . Having lost his earthly body to a trio of S & M demons , the Cenobites , he is brought back into existence by a drop of blood on the floor . He soon forces his former mistress to bring him his necessary human sacrifices to complete his body . . . but the Cenobites won't be happy about this . - I've always thought that Hellraiser is a good movie , but I am not as " in love " with it as a lot of horror fans . The special effects seem to be one of the major draws and , while I agree that they are very well done , I'm just not into a lot of gore effects . I will give the special effects people credit for some jaw dropping moments . If this movie were made today , CGI would replace ( and ruin ) a lot of what's seen . Hellraiser is one of the better examples of what can be done with " real " effects . - Pinhead and , to a lesser extent , the other Cenobites have become cultural icons . But , in Hellraiser , they are given so little screen time that they are really nothing more than minor supporting players . Watching the movie , you learn very little about the Cenobites and how they came to be ( it's not until the sequels that we learn anything about their origin ) . Had there never been all of the sequels , I contend that Pinhead and his buddys wouldn't be nearly as " famous " as they are . - I suppose my biggest problem with the movie is the characters . For me to completely enjoy a horror movie , there has to be someone I care about . None of these characters are worth empathy . I suppose the daughter could be a character I could care about , but she has so little screen time until she's under attack that I never felt as if I knew her .
365944	3109237	65206	8.0	" You've had such rotten luck with your housekeepers Aunt Claire . "	Claire Marrable ( Geraldine Page ) is shocked to learn that her late husband has left her with nothing but debts . How is she to live in the style she's grown accustomed ? To solve her problem , she comes up with a fiendish plot . What if she were to hire a servant / companion with a small life savings , dupe her out of the money , and then kill her ? Well , that's exactly what Claire does . She disposes of the bodies under pine trees growing in her garden . All is going well for Claire until Alice Dimmock ( Ruth Gordon ) shows up at her door looking for a job . Claire doesn't realize it but the nosey Alice is no ordinary employee . Can Alice discover Claire's secret before another pine tree is planted ? What a wonderful movie ! In short , What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice ? is a deliciously twisted tale of greed and murder filled with plenty of suspense , real atmosphere , rock solid acting , witty writing , and some of the darkest humor put on film . It's a real winner from start to finish . And while I'm sure I could go on and on praising the film , it's the acting that sets it apart from similar movies . To call Geraldine Page's performance brilliant would be a gross understatement . The gleeful menace in her voice and on her face as she goes about psychologically torturing ( and killing ) those see sees as beneath her is amazing to watch . And if her presence wasn't enough , along comes Ruth Gordon . She's feisty , fun , and every bit the equal of Page in her role as the titular Aunt Alice . Watching these two spar when all the film's secrets have been revealed is one of those moments I won't soon forget . These are the screen moments that keep me searching out new movies . Nobody asked , but if I had to come up with one flaw , I suppose it would be the supporting cast . None of the other actors does anything to stand out . But how could they ? Compared with Page and Gordon . . . well , there's really no comparison . Finally , from the outside some 40 years after the movie was made , I'd bet the actors had a blast making What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice ? I can just imagine Page and Gordon having a good long laugh after shooting some of their scenes together . Then again , maybe it's just me . All I know is that I had a great time watching them work together . An seems about right to me .
366513	3109237	424942	8.0	If you get the chance , see it in 3D on an IMAX screen	This past weekend , the family and I went to the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga . While there , we caught Deep Sea 3D at the IMAX theater . My son has a copy of the movie on DVD , so I knew what to expect and knew the basic premise of the film . What I didn't expect were some truly amazing visuals . I was completely blown away by the images . There's a scene at the very beginning where the waves come rolling in toward the camera . The 3D effects actually made me jump . It looked like we were about to get soaked . The underwater scenes were just as cool with great colors , interesting and unusual animal life , and solid 3D visuals . Both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do an acceptable job with the narration . I've read where some complained that the script was geared toward smaller children . Well , I was with a small child so that didn't bother me . My only complaint with the experience is some of the added sound effects . The folly guys worked overtime and the end result is pretty bad . Scallops fleeing from a marauding sea star do not sound like school kids on the playground . Having watched Deep Sea 3D on an IMAX screen in 3D , I don't know that my son will be able to watch his DVD on a regular TV anymore . The IMAX 3D was that amazing .
366164	3109237	479977	8.0	" To be right all the time might get a bit monotonous . "	Richard Abernethie , a very wealthy man , has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral . Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister Cora Galaccio . While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years , they all agree that Cora was always a bit different . So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered , most laugh it off as one of Cora's eccentricities . But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously . The next day , Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently . Is there a connection between the two deaths ? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer . After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series . I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and , from what I remember , the movie is as faithful to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments . The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues , suspects , and red herrings . And as I've written before , I always enjoy an Christie story where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal . It might be old fashioned , but that's the way I like it . Getting beyond the plot , technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner . Sets , editing , direction , and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies . The acting is equally impressive . I've come to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he doesn't disappoint here . The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance . Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced , I've got no real complaints . It's a good show all the way around .
366264	3109237	43660	8.0	Robert Wise scores again	The House on Telegraph Hill is a wonderfully entertaining thriller dealing with a woman living under an assumed identity and the child she claims as her own . The movie may be part of Fox's Film Noir Collection , but it's really more of a Hitchcock " woman-in-peril " type film . The movie may seem unusual when seen today with the modern emphasis on the plot twist . Throughout most of the film , I kept waiting for the inevitable twist that never materialized . The lack of a twist each time I thought I saw one coming was , in its own way , the best twist of all . The House on Telegraph Hill is deliberately paced and shot beautifully by Robert Wise . Some of the interior scenes , especially those in the hallway of the old house , look as good as you'll see . The acting is great with the relative unknown ( at least unknown to me ) Valentina Cortese giving a real standout performance . She has an undeniable screen presence and the ability to draw a viewer in . I really felt for her character's situation throughout the movie . The ending of the film is very nicely done and had me on the edge of my seat . As I was waiting for a twist , I was completely surprised by the final act . The drama and suspense are almost palatable throughout the film's finale . Overall , The House on Telegraph Hill is a very nice , under-seen film .
366846	3109237	68401	8.0	My favorite Columbo	- A kidnapping proves to be a cover for a man and his uncle to make a quick buck by splitting the ransom money . Things are going along smoothly until the uncle decides to change the plan from a kidnapping to a murder . Columbo is on hand ( with a partner ) to solve the case with his own unique style . - This may be my favorite of the Columbo episodes that I've seen so far . Ray Milland makes an excellent adversary for Columbo . In The Greenhouse Jungle , he proves he could chew the scenery with the best of Hollywood . Columbo's " partner " , Sergeant Wilson ( Bob Dishy ) , is one of the few comic relief type characters I've ever seen that is really funny . The rest of the supporting cast is also quite good . - But the thing that makes this one of my favorite Columbo is the mystery itself . The way Columbo solves the murder in this one is truly surprising . Even though the clue that leads to the resolution of the murder is in plain sight , I didn't realize what it was or even why it was in the movie . It's a notch above the normal Columbo fare . - To anyone unfamiliar with Columbo , this would make a great place to start .
366879	3109237	143145	8.0	" There's no point living , if you can't feel alive . "	From the time he took over the role of James Bond , I've tended to dismiss the Pierce Brosnan era as one of the weaker periods of the franchise . That assessment was cemented with Brosnan's last outing as Bond in Die Another Day ? quite possibly the very worst of the 21 official Bond movies . But something odd keeps happening . I keep going back to The World is Not Enough . I've actually probably seen it more times in the past 5 years than any other Bond film . I realize now that it's not only Brosnan's best effort in the series , but also it's one of my five or six favorite Bond movies . In The World is Not Enough , Bond is sent to the Caspian Sea to protect an oil heiress , Elektra King ( Sophie Marceau ) , after her father is killed in an explosion at MI-6 Headquarters . King's is in a race with three other groups to be the first to complete an oil pipeline to bring their product to market . And someone seems intent on making sure Elektra doesn't win the race . Bond discovers that a terrorist named Renard ( Robert Carlyle ) may be responsible for the father's death , the threats against Elektra and the pipeline , and the theft of enough plutonium to destroy a good chunk of Turkey . But Bond also discovers that things may not be as they seem . Is Elektra really as innocent as she seems ? Or is she , as unthinkable as it may be , in league with Renard ? There are a lot of things about The World is Not Enough that keep me coming back . The most obvious is the plot . It definitely has a darker , more realistic tone to it than one normally associates with a James Bond film . It has more in common with To Russia with Love than it does the quip-filled gimmicky Bond movies of Roger Moore . And Brosnan does a more than competent job playing Bond with the same sort dark tone . The World is Not Enough actually shows Bond killing in cold blood . Don't get the wrong impression ? there is still humor to be found in the film , but it's used very judiciously . Speaking of realism , other than the whole bullet in the brain making him impervious to pain , Robert Carlyle's Renard is a much more frightening advisory than the cartoonish villains with their ridiculous plans to take over the world . Renard could almost be a real-world terrorist . I also appreciate the increased role for Judy Dench as M in The World is Not Enough . It's good to see M out from behind her desk and in the field . But the real highlight of the film for me is Sophie Marceau as Elektra King . Not only does Marceau prove herself to be a talented actress , but the writers actually gave her something to work with . Too often in the Bond movies of the past , woman who start out as Bond's enemies find themselves swooning after a single encounter . Not Elektra . She remains defiant till the end . In fact , Elektra turns the tables on Bond . She uses Bond the way he normally uses women . And in this instance , Bond's the one doing the swooning . Elektra may not be the normal , run of the mill Bond girl , but I for one am glad of that . As for the negatives found in The World is Not Enough , I'm going to beat the same dead horse found in most other comments and point to Denise Richards . In a word , she's terrible . Her entire career is based on her looks because she certainly can't act . I cannot remember a single actor in any Bond movie ( and that includes the likes of Tonya Roberts ) who was so ill-suited to play their part . Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist ? yeah , right . Five years ago I rated The World is Not Enough a . The rating , however , seems to go up with each successive viewing . I'm at an now . Who knows what will happen the next time I watch this movie .
365929	3109237	74156	8.0	I wish Carpenter could still make ' em like this	- A new Lieutenant takes over a police precinct on its very last night . Almost everyone and everything has been moved into the new station . It should be an easy night - just direct all callers and visitors to the new precinct building . But a series of gang deaths will make this night anything but easy . The gang wants revenge and selects the almost abandoned precinct as their target . The gang members have taken a blood oath to die if they must , but someone's going to pay for killing members of their group . With two secretarial types and two death-row inmates , the Lieutenant must fight off the gang's siege on Precinct 13 if he is to survive the night . - Assault on Precinct 13 may start a little slow , but once the action starts , it's kick-ass action all the way . It's not a perfect movie by any means . For example , much of the acting and dialogue are near laughable . But , John Carpenter makes up for this with a gripping , suspenseful story that rarely lets up . Carpenter is able to build atmosphere and chemistry between the characters - things I find lacking in many newer movies . The shoot-outs as the gang members come in waves at the building are flawlessly choreographed . While some of the jokes don't work , many are laugh-out-loud funny . - While I've heard Carpenter say that Assault on Precinct 13 is his modern day Rio Bravo , I think the movie has much more in common with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead . The similarities are almost endless : Both movies have people trapped in a building . The people in both movies are lead by a black man , something still rare in 1976 . The people are under attack by wave after wave of basically faceless hordes - be they zombie or gang member . A character in both movies tries to make a getaway in a nearby vehicle - both with disastrous results . Both movies feature a basically catatonic character that the others will protect for no real reason . Both movies mix characters from different socioeconomic standings into a cohesive fighting force . And so on . - While Assault on Precinct 13 may have its share of flaws , it's one helluva ride .
366891	3109237	32484	8.0	" I'm in love with a girl , and I'm going to help hang her father . "	Several weeks ago , I decided to give some of the older , less well known Hitchcock films a try . So far , this has been mostly a pleasant experience and has introduced me to several new favorites . Foreign Correspondent may not be the best of the early Hitchcock offerings I've watched recently , but it's still a very solid film . It's the story of a reporter from New York sent to cover the events as Europe stands on the threshold of war . He's soon mixed up in a plot to kidnap the one man who may be able to put a stop to things . But who can he trust ? It doesn't help matters that the woman he has fallen in love with seems to be at the center of his investigation . The biggest flaw in Foreign Correspondent that I see is the length of time it takes to really get into things . The opening scenes are nicely shot , but they're not that interesting . It takes a while for the movie to grab you and pull you in . But once things start happening , it's non-stop action and intrigue . Foreign Correspondent rarely pauses for you to take a breath . Before you know it , you're on to the next scene of increasing suspense . While it's fairly easy to spot the man behind the plot to start war , it's interesting to watch the way Hitchcock allows the events to unfold . Characters do not jump to wild conclusions but work toward them gathering evidence along the way . It's a nice job of storytelling . Joel McCrea is billed as the film's star . And while he's okay , I doubt very sincerely that he would have been able to pull off a film like Foreign Correspondent without a superb supporting cast . I've made no secret about enjoying George Sanders in just about every role I've ever seen him in . He's as good in Foreign Correspondent as ever . The man makes every scene he's in better . The rest of the cast is just as solid with Herbert Marshall being another standout . It's been a joy to discover these films for the first time . If movies like Foreign Correspondent are any indication of things to come , I'm looking forward to continuing my journey through Hitchcock's filmography . Next up : The Lady Vanishes .
366459	3109237	60701	8.0	My New Favorite Franco	- A more apt title for the movie might be The Daughter of the Diabolical Doctor Z . Dr . Z doesn't make it through the first 15 minutes of the movie before he dies of a heart attack . His daughter ( also a doctor ) blames those who scoffed at her father's ideas for his death . Continuing with her father's work , she vows revenge . Using his mind control procedures , she creates two " slaves " to carry out her plan . - I have dubbed this movie " My New Favorite Franco " , just beating out Venus in Furs for the title . Where many of his movies seem to lose their way , The Diabolical Doctor Z has a straight forward plot and takes the time necessary to build atmosphere . Too often Franco's films seem rushed or go in so many directions that nothing seems to make much sense . - The choice made by the daughter of the beautiful performance artist , Miss Death , as a " weapon " for her revenge is interesting . Much like a spider , Miss Death first seduces her prey before using her long nails that have been dipped in poison to kill . Miss Death's spider web nightclub dance is a must see . - This is the second Franco film that I've seen that reminded me in some way of Franju's Eyes Without a Face . While the influence on the other Franco film , The Awful Dr . Orloff , is obvious , here it is much more subtle . The face surgery scene is eerily reminiscent of Franju's face surgery scene .
366800	3109237	39645	8.0	" Everything you touch turns to rigormortis . "	What a wonderfully entertaining and funny movie ! Bob Hope and Company do an incredible job in My Favorite Brunette of parodying the dark detective movies that were so popular at the time . The situations in which Hope finds himself are perfect for his brand of humor . The jokes come fast and furious and , fortunately , most hit their mark . Hope is joined by an excellent cast that includes Dorothy Lamour in the femme fatal role , Peter Lorre as a knife-throwing killer , and Lon Chaney , Jr . as a simple , but ultimately kind gangster whose efforts to help Hope only seem to get him in deeper . The whole supporting cast is great . And director Elliott Nugent keeps the pace flowing with never a dull moment . In fact , it's a first rate job from everyone involved . My Favorite Brunette is one that any fan of classic movies ( especially film noir ) should not miss . I only hate that it took me so long to see the movie .
366069	3109237	516937	8.0	A good start to the 1965 season	I've been a fan of The Avengers for as long as I can remember , but unfortunately , I've honestly never seen more than the odd episode here and there . Thanks to Netflix , I've decided to change that . I've also decided to not start at the beginning of the series , but with the 1965 season instead . As many fans will undoubtedly know , 1965 is the season that Diana Rigg joined the show as Mrs . Emma Peel . Mrs . Peel's introduction has to be one of the most " nothing " moments in television history . She's quite literally just there . No fanfare at all . But then again , this is The Avengers . The low-key approach to something like a new major character is in keeping with the show's overall tone . Like the character Steed , " unflappable " is a good work to use when describing the entire series . The first episode of 1965 , " The Town of No Return " encapsulates what I enjoy about the show . Quirky characters , bizarre situations , solid acting , and a sinister air of mystery are all present in this episode . Steed and Mrs . Peel arrive in a small town to investigate the disappearances of several agents who have gone in before them . The quaint little town is situated near a WWII air base . But something is wrong . There aren't enough people . And those who are there aren't who they seem to be . Steed and Mrs . Peel find themselves at the air base investigating an invasion from within ( so to speak ) . Even though this was their first episode together , Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee are as good always . Their chemistry seems to have been instantaneous . They are joined by a good , but small supporting cast that includes Terence Alexander as the overly genial barkeep named ' Piggy " Warren and Robert Brown ( who I immediately recognized as M from the James Bond films of the 1980s ) as the very sinister Saul . I'm sure that having a director as skilled in horror as Roy Ward Baker contributed greatly to the episodes atmosphere . As is the case with many of The Avengers episodes I've seen , the writing is the real standout . " The Town of No Return " is no different . It's well written and interesting throughout . Though some of the details in the underground bunker near the end get a bit messy , this is a very minor quibble to what is otherwise an entertaining start to the 1965 season .
366302	3109237	57226	8.0	Excellent Hammer Vampire Story	- This was my second opportunity to see Kiss of the Vampire . Watching and enjoying a Hammer film is what I call a very comfortable experience . And , Kiss of the Vampire does not disappoint ? it is very comfortable . - The basic story ( with possible minor SPOILERS ) : A couple honeymooning in Bavaria becomes stranded . They soon meet the local " big man " , Ravna , and are invited to visit with him and his family at their château . They are later asked to attend a party at the château . During the party , the husband and wife are separated . While the husband is being drugged , the wife is being bitten by Ravna and made a member of his vampire cult . The husband wakes and must do whatever he can to save his wife . Anymore of the story would be too much . - Most of the acting was at least adequate . The exception to this was Ravna's son as played by Barry Warren . A tree limb could show more emotion . - Being a Hammer film , you expect it to have that Hammer look . There was no disappointment here . The colors are as rich as you would expect . The ball gown worn by the wife has to be one of the most vivid shades of red ever filmed . In addition , there's plenty of the bright red blood so famous in Hammer films . Overall , this is a very visually pleasing film . - My biggest complaint with Kiss of the Vampire was that Lee and / or Cushing are missing from the proceedings . Either's presence could have easily made this one of Hammer's best vampire films .
366077	3109237	373883	8.0	" These eyes will deceive you , they will destroy you . "	Unlike some other fan comments I read on the internet , as soon as I heard the news that Rob Zombie was going to remake Halloween , I was ecstatic . Halloween has always been a favorite of mine . In fact , I've probably seen it more times over the years than any other horror movie . As for Zombie , I loved both his first two movies ( yes , I loved what I consider to be the very underrated House of 1000 Corpses ) . The whole project seemed like a sure fire winner to me . Overall , I enjoyed Zombie's reinterpretation of John Carpenter's classic quite a bit . It's not perfect , but it's a damn good effort . While I appreciate the fact that Zombie followed the basic storyline of the original , he threw in enough of his own ideas and scenes to keep it original and keep the audience guessing . One thing that makes me laugh are the comments I've read that complain the movie has too much foul language , too much violence , and too much nudity . What were these people expecting ? It's a Rob Zombie movie ! The final chase scene is for the most part expertly handled . The old Myers house becomes more of a focus and I enjoyed the chase going through every conceivable room and level . And just when it seemed the chase was over , Zombie's inclusion of false endings really caught me off guard . I was very impressed with the direction of this portion of the film . Other highlights for me included some of the acting . Daeg Faerch is surprisingly good as the young Michael Myers . He has an innocence about him that he plays to his advantage . I'm also surprised at how effective Sherri Moon Zombie was at playing Michael's mother . After her husband's first two movies , I thought of her as little more than a one note actor . While she will never get near an acting award , she did show a little range with her performance in Halloween . And Malcolm McDowell is . . . well , he's Malcolm McDowell ? a wonderful actor . I don't think there's much more that need be said . The music was a real asset in the movie . Zombie used Carpenter's original score to great effect and mixed in some nice period pieces . I've seen some on the internet complain about the inclusion of the song " Love Hurts " at a particularly key moment in the movie . Well , I loved it and thought it fit perfectly . Finally , I've just got to say I loved some of the casting decisions , particularly the cameos . Some seemed quite natural ? Danny Trejo as an institution worker , Clint Howard as a doctor , and Sybil Danning as a nurse . But Micky Dolenz from the Monkees as a gun store owner ? How cool is that ? Freakin ' Micky Dolenz ! Okay , enough of the good . As I said in the opening , the movie's not perfect . But I'm not going to sit here and pick the movie apart , so I'll limit this to three of the most obvious faults I saw in the movie . First , the opening 30 minutes that detail Michael's childhood before the killings start goes on far too long and takes away from the mystery of Michael . Too many movies try to explain away everything . Zombie , unfortunately , falls into this trap . Next , I've got a real problem with the way Zombie chose to present Laurie Strode and her friends . There's no real attempt to make them more than one dimensional characters . Who are they ? Why do they do the things they do ? Why should I care about them at all ? Finally , and this is a biggie , I have a problem with ( and though I've tried to limit the comparisons with Carpenter's movie , this one has to be mentioned ) the lack of atmosphere and subtlety in this version of Halloween . Zombie seemed to be rushing the last half of the movie and missed out on what made the original a classic . How many times did Michael materialize out of the shadows in the 1978 movie ? Man , was that ever creepy or what ? Zombie seems content to let the audience know exactly where Michael is at all times . And if you do lose sight of him , be patient ? he's bound to come crashing through a wall at any minute . It really lessens the mystery and suspense . But when it gets right down to it , regardless of the strengths and weaknesses I see in a particular movie , it's all about entertainment . Did the movie entertain me ? It may sound shallow , but that's the most important factor for me . And when it comes to entertainment , Rob Zombie's Halloween was very successful . I had a great time in the nearly packed theater and I think the others did as well . It's been awhile since I've seen a movie where people clapped when it was over . And about half the crowd did just that at my opening night showing . I may change my opinion after repeat viewings , but for now I'll give it an . Good going Rob ! Looking forward to seeing what you come up with next .

Ali Kareem , to take a look at his latest archaeological find . But Dr . Kareem has other plans in mind for Dr . Quest and family - and they don't include sightseeing . Dr . Kareem is behind the recent theft of the mask of Anubis . He hopes to pin the theft on Dr . Quest so that his plans might be fulfilled . Unknown to Dr . Kareem ( or Dr . Quest for that matter ) , however , the mummy Anubis has come to life and is searching the countryside for his lost possession . I can just imagine that someone smarter than me might take a look at " The Curse of Anubis " and write an essay about the unflattering portrayal of Middle Easterners by Westerners . Or they might write about the significance Dr . Ali Kareem's ramblings calling for a unified Arab state . But you won't get that from me . I've never watched an episode of Jonny Quest and come away with the un-PC notions some other viewers seem to . For me , it's all about the mummy Anubis as he makes his slow march across the desert . " The Curse of Anubis " features one of my absolute favorite moments from Jonny Quest . It might not sound like much , but the sight of Anubis standing on the dune with the moon in the background as his tattered bandages flap in the breeze ? Wow ! I loved it as a kid and still think it's a great sight . The biggest weakness I see in this episode is with the ambiguity of Dr . Kareem's plans . Don't ask me what those plans are because Dr . Kareem's thinking makes very little sense to me .
366607	3109237	207332	8.0	Informative and Entertaining	The original Planet of the Apes has always been one of my favorite movies . This two-hour making-of , behind-the-scenes documentary is a must for any fan of the movie . I've seen it three times now and I never get tired of the stories of the make-up , casting decisions , and screenplay rewrites . It's truly fascinating . Considering that Planet of the Apes was made in 1968 , I'm always amazed that there was so much film footage available in 1998 for this documentary . My favorite clips have to be those of the make-up transformations of the cast . Say what you will about the man , but Roddy McDowall has always been one of my favorite actors . He was a solid and natural choice to narrate this film and I'm glad he agreed to do it . Other than Beneath the Planet of the Apes , he was there and offers good insights into how these movies were made .
366086	3109237	430950	8.0	A wonderful " making of " feature	Conan Unchained : The Making of Conan is an interesting look back , almost 20 years later , at probably the best Sword and Sorcerer movie ever made ? Conan the Barbarian . Maybe it has something to do with my almost fanboy kind of love for the subject matter , but this is one of the more entertaining " making of " documentaries I've seen . It's filled with stories and memories of many of the cast and crew involved in the movie . A few of my favorite moments include Arnold talking about being chased by wolves , Sandahl Bergman's story of almost losing a finger , and Max Von Sydow reminiscing about his favorite scene ( it was actually cut from the movie ) . But it's director John Miliius ' enthusiasm for the movie ? even some 20 years later ? that makes this " making of " feature so special . He comes across as a real , down-to-earth sort of guy that you'd actually like to meet . His feelings for the movie are quite evident and infectious . After listening to him talk about " The Great Danes " or the wheel of pain or the giant snake the crew built , I can't wait to watch the movie again . As much as I enjoyed Conan Unchained : The Making of Conan , I can't call it perfect . There are a few things I would have liked to have seen included . While most of the cast was interviewed for the documentary , I would have really enjoyed hearing form Mako , Ben Davidson , and / or Sven-Ole Thorsen . Also , I would have liked to see some discussion on the effect Conan the Barbarian had on the genre , the imitators , and its long lasting appeal . But you can't have everything . And as it is , Conan Unchained : The Making of Conan is still very entertaining .
366865	3109237	57443	8.0	Classic Bava	- Nora Davis ( Leticia Roman ) is a young woman hoping to have a wonderful vacation in Italy . Within 24 hours of her arrival , she is almost mistakenly arrested for drug smuggling , the aunt she is staying with dies , she has her purse stolen , and she witnesses a murder . But the police can find no body and no signs of a murder . It seems that no on believes her . It's up to Nora to discover the truth to what happened that rainy night in the plaza . - Mario Bava is known for his magnificent use of color . So , it's a little odd that two of my favorite films that Bava made ( The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Black Sunday ) are black & white . Whatever the format , Bava again demonstrates his mastery of shadows and light very effectively . The film presents a series of images that are hard to forget . Each shot is perfection . One of my favorites is of the thief who steals Nora's purse as he moves from one side of the stairs to the other . It is admittedly a very minor moment , but Bava puts more care into this insignificant tracking shot than most director's do in the main scenes of their movies . It is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen . - The Girl Who Knew Too Much is an obvious ( and not just in title ) homage to Alfred Hitchcock . Bava has loaded the movie with moments that are done as I imagine Hitchcock would have done them . If the movie weren't in Italian , you would swear Hitchcock directed it . - But the thing that make this movie so effective is Leticia Roman as Nora . Her performance is one of the best I've seen in a Bava film . She comes off as fragile , yet determined , depending upon what the script calls for . She has a believability that is necessary for this kind of movie if the audience to feel concern when she is in peril . Roman is perfect in the role . - One final note , this movie is often cited as the first giallo . Whether this is true or not , I only know what I've read . The Girl Who Knew Too Much does establish a very elementary framework for later gialli to follow . But , it bears little resemblance to the gialli that would come later . It's not until Bava fleshed-out the giallo in Blood and Black Lace do we get look and " rules " that have become so familiar to fans of the genre .
366899	3109237	76584	9.0	Badass form start to finish	For my 1 , 000th user-comment on IMDb , I wanted to write about something that I not only enjoyed , but something that summed up or represented my feelings about and tastes in movies . You know , something that has my name written all over it . I considered a number of films ? some bad ? some good - but in the end , I decided to go with The Inglorious Bastards . Not only is it a great example of the kind of movie I go for , but I've been wanting to write something about it for a while now . And with Tarantino's re-imaging set to open this year , I definitely wanted to get my user comment written beforehand . So here it is , # 1 , 000 . As the film opens , a group of WWII era soldiers are being transferred to a military prison to await decision on the many crimes they've committed . Murder , theft , robbery ? these aren't your typical , clean-cut , all-American GIs . On the way , the MP convoy is attacked by a German plane and a band of five prisoners escapes . They immediately decide to head to neutral Switzerland and the freedom it offers . On the way , they have plenty of opportunities to kill and maim Nazis . But when they accidentally shoot a group of American paratroopers disguised as German soldiers , the Bastards decide to stand in and complete their compatriots ' mission . And what a mission it is ? steal a train carrying a V2 rocket . If director Enzo G . Castellari is known for anything , it's action . And in The Inglorious Bastards , he outdoes himself . It's a testosterone injected ride from start to finish ! Gun battles , explosions , vehicle wrecks , fights , falls off castle walls , motorcycle stunts ? if it involves action , you'll find it here . Castellari somehow manages to keep the film well paced throughout . While the action does admittedly slow a tad in the second act , the film never bogs down and is always enjoyable . The Inglorious Bastards also features some really nice miniature work . The film's finale is especially memorable on that front . The cast is first rate . Fred " the Hammer " Williamson may be third billed , but he's the real star . Williamson's character is appropriately named Fred . Appropriate because he's pretty much playing himself ? a cigar-chomping , one-line spewing , gun-toting badass . Surprising to me is that Bo Svenson is able to match Williamson scene for scene . I've never thought much of his other work that I've seen , but here , Svenson is very believable as the in control leader of the Bastards . The rest of the cast provide equally enjoyable performances . It's an excellent job by all involved . While I can see why The Inglorious Bastards might not appeal to everyone , for me , it's a near perfect movie . I've seen some reviews nit-pick the lack of realism . Relax , this was never intended to be a documentary . It's about having a good time and enjoying yourself . Just go with it and quit being so uptight . As for those who complain about the dialogue or the editing , you're obviously not familiar with Euro movie making from the 60s and 70s . Again , just go with it . Like I said , it's almost perfect to me . In fact , I've got no problem at all rating The Inglorious Bastards a , verging on a . So here's to 1 , 000 user comments . For those of you who have read and maybe even enjoyed some of what I've written , I say thanks . And look forward to more to come . On to 1 , 001 !
366582	3109237	31951	9.0	" One doesn't easily forget , Herr Baron , an arm torn out by the roots . "	When Baron Wolf von Frankenstein ( Basil Rathbone ) arrives to take over his father's estate , the locals immediately begin to fear for the worst . Wolf's father created a monster that terrorized the community and the townsfolk want no more of that . Wolf assures everyone that he has no intentions of creating a monster . But when Wolf finds Ygor ( Bela Lugosi ) living in the ruins of his father's laboratory , he is soon headed down the same path of destruction that claimed his father . Over the years , there have been volumes written on the Universal classic horror movies . Realizing that it would be foolish of me to attempt to improve or add much to the writings of these scholars , I'll instead focus on a couple of areas that make Son of Frankenstein so special to me . 1 . The Acting . Son of Frankenstein features a Who's Who of the best of the classic horror actors . Joining Rathbone and Lugosi in the cast are Boris Karloff and Lionel Atwill . While each gives a noteworthy performance in their own right , Lugosi's performance is generally held up as the best of his career . And while I agree , Rathbone makes Son of Frankenstein a joy for me to watch . There are very few actors that I can think of who could have played Wolf with the same type of intelligent energy that Rathbone exhibits . He's wonderful . As for Karloff , I'm glad he decided to make Son of Frankenstein his last as the monster . By the time of the second sequel , Karloff's monster became little more that a prop for Lugosi , Rathbone , and Atwill to fight over . 2 . The Sets . I'm not exaggerating when I say that the sets in Son of Frankenstein are among the best I've ever seen . The sets are amazing with their bizarre angles and shadows . Two that immediately come to mind are the dining table set and the staircase set at the beginning of the movie . They are in a class of their own . Every fan of horror , or just good classic movies in general , owes it to themselves to see Son of Frankenstein . It may not be as well known among the casual fan as either Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein , but it many ways it's the equal of those two films ( if not better ) .
366361	3109237	74937	9.0	" Room filled with empty people . "	There are three movies that , for whatever reason , I have watched literally 100s of times . Murder By Death is one of the three movies . The great thing is that I never get tired of it . It never gets old with me . The comedy is as fresh today as it was in 1976 when I saw Murder By Death in the theater . I think the movie appeals to me because I grew up reading Agatha Christie and watching Charlie Chan on The Late Show . Later , when I discovered the Humphrey Bogart movies and the Thin Man movies , I became an instant fan . I get a real kick out watching Neil Simon poke fun at the characters from these books and movies . The screenplay is clever , intelligent , and , most importantly , funny . I all but laugh out loud every time I watch the " dead , naked butler " bit or listen to Peter Selles arguing with the " cow " on the wall . It's good stuff ! In addition to Simon's writing , the acting in Murder By Death is a real highlight . The cast is a Who's Who of some of the best actors of the 60s and 70s . David Niven , Peter Sellers , Alec Guinness , Peter Falk , and every other member of the cast ( including the usually annoying James Coco ) are all wonderful . Their parodies of the famous detectives are dead-on perfect . But the best , in my opinion , is Maggie Smith . It's amazing that in a group of such renowned actors , Smith is able to steal almost every scene and become the center of attention . She is simply amazing in Murder By Death . I could watch her all day . So , here's to another 100 viewings of Murder By Death ! I can't get enough of it .
365967	3109237	73582	9.0	Argento : The Master of the Giallo	During a demonstration of her psychic ability , a woman senses the presence of a killer in the audience . Later that night , she is attacked and brutally murdered in her apartment . Marcus Daly ( David Hemmings ) witnesses the murder of the psychic and goes to the apartment to help / investigate . He later tells the police that he saw something when he entered the apartment , but he's not sure what it was . With the assistance of a female reporter , Daly begins looking for clues to the killer's identity . As he gets closer to the truth , the body count begins to rise . Can he remember what he saw in the apartment and stop the killer before he becomes the next victim ? With Deep Red , Dario Argento created what may be the best Giallo ever produced . Mario Bava may be credited with developing the rules and structure of the Giallo in Blood and Black Lace , but Argento succeeded in making the sub-genre his own . Everything about the movie is nearly perfect . And Argento does something that quite honestly few Gialli have accomplished ? actually create moments of real horror ( or at least a few chills ) . The scenes where Daly is investigating the rundown , rambling villa has some moments that always bring me to edge of my seat . As for the mystery , Deep Red features what I feel is one of Argento's best plots . And the fact that Argento gives you everything you need to solve the mystery will leave you kicking yourself for not seeing all of the significant clues . Argento takes a big chance by giving the solution so early on , it's just that no one seems to pick-up on it during a first viewing . Brilliant ! There are two different versions of this movie available ? the original extended version and the cut American version . This is one of the very few movies I know of where people I respect actually prefer the cut version . Either version is watchable so it's really just a matter of taste . For the record , I prefer the extended version . Whichever cut of the film you select , make sure to watch in widescreen . There's a lot of vital information that's cut from the sides of the full-frame transfer .
366605	3109237	77413	9.0	" Oh ! Never have I seen such a reptile in a first class cabin ! "	Growing up , I was a huge fan of Agatha Christie's books . I would read and reread everyone I could get my hands on . I remember being terribly excited when Death on the Nile was released in 1978 . The movie quickly became a favorite of mine that I've watched literally hundreds of times over the years without ever growing tired of it . I still find new things to enjoy with each viewing . The movie has lost none of its entertainment value on me . For me , there are two areas where Death on the Nile really excels ? Christie's story and the acting . Death on the Nile follows the basic plot structure Christie used over and over ? a group of people is isolated on a boat , train , old house , island , etc . A murder soon follows that only one of these people could have committed . Everyone is a suspect . Each character has a motive and the opportunity to have committed the murder . Death on the Nile is one of the best examples of this plot structure that Christie wrote . Unlike other mysteries , Death on the Nile does not cheat . There are no characters introduced in the last minute and there are not vital clues that the detective discovers just before revealing the murderer . It's played straight . Everything that Christie's detective Poirot knows , the viewer also knows . It's just that most of us would never put the clues together in the same manner Poirot does . As for the acting , Death on the Nile features a wonderful cast . While my personal favorites are Maggie Smith , Angela Lansbury , and Bette Davis , everyone in the cast gives a terrific performance . It may be something as simple as the look Davis gives when some Egyptian children " moon " her from the shore or it may be something as elaborate as Lansbury's over-the-top portrayal of the over-sexed writer , each character is played to perfection . In short , the acting is first rate . Two complaints I've read across the internet involve the perceived padding of the script and characters that aren't well rounded . The padding argument usually concerns shot after shot of Egyptian locations without much happening . Maybe it's just me , but I enjoy the scenery . Plus , I am usually having such a good time with the film that I don't want any of it to rush by . As for the characters , while it is a valid argument , I understand that it's the way Christie wrote . Most of her characters were simply there to be suspects . The rest of their lives didn't matter . I must confess that I too would have liked to see a little more dimension and depth added to some of these fascinating people . It's my only complaint .
366751	3109237	23293	9.0	" They used to bring their women here - brazen , lolling creatures in silks and satins . "	With a classic like The Old Dark House , it's all but impossible to come up with something new and unique to say about the film that hasn't already been said a thousand times . I won't even try . Instead , I'll focus on a few of the things that make the film so special to me . First , it's the acting and the characters that bring such life to The Old Dark House and make me want to revisit it time after time . The cast is possibly the finest ensemble gathered for a horror movie in the 30s . Notables such as Charles Laughton , Boris Karloff , Melvyn Douglas , and Gloria Stewart each make the film a joy to watch . Each gives a great performance . But it's Ernest Thesiger that I enjoy the most . His portrayal of the eccentric Horace Femm surpasses , in my mind , his better known role of Dr . Pretorius from Bride of Frankenstein . I realize that this will seem almost blasphemous to some , but it's honestly the way I feel . It's one of the more memorable performances from the early 30s . I'm also a fan of the way James Whale filmed The Old Dark House . A lot of the early talkies feel " stagey " when viewed today . But even though The Old Dark House is in reality " stagey " , it never feels like that . Whale does an admirable job of keeping the action flowing given such a small set to work with . Filming from different angles and keeping the exact size of the set hidden in the shadows add to the feeling of more space than is actually there . It's quite an achievement for a film made over 70 years ago . Finally , and this is more of a personal thing , I've always been a fan of the old , dark house mystery genre . In The Old Dark House , the mystery of the nutty Femm family replaces the more standard murder mystery . I consider The Old Dark House the standard barrier for this kind of movie . A spooky old house with mysterious locked rooms , a raging thunderstorm of epic proportions , a group of stranded travelers , and a family of off-the-wall inhabitants are among the films highlights .
366207	3109237	36376	9.0	" D - r - a - c . . . "	Even though I consider myself a classic horror fan ( and a fan of the classic Universal horror movies in particular ) , I readily admit that Dracula ( 1931 ) is not among my favorites . In fact , I prefer almost all of the Dracula sequels to the original . And , I consider Son of Dracula the best of the bunch . Why ? I'm prepared to write about three areas in Son of Dracula that work almost perfectly for me : the atmosphere , the mix of genres / styles , and the cast . - Atmosphere ? Son of Dracula positively drips with atmosphere . The misty swamps , the expertly lit interiors , the luscious sets , the eerie music , and Robert Siodmak's direction all contribute to the richness and underlying sense of taboo and dread . One scene that perfectly demonstrates the film's atmosphere is the rise of Dracula from the swamps . The coffin rises from the swamp floor , a vaporous mist comes forth eventually changing into Dracula's solid form , he glides effortlessly across the swamp to meet his mortal love and future wife ? man , you could bath in the atmosphere . - Mix of genres / styles ? Throughout its history , horror has often been combined with other genres or styles of movies . Most obvious are the great number of horror / comedies or horror / sci-fi films you can find . Sometimes , horror is mixed in more unusual ways . For example , there are horror / Westerns and even horror / romance films . Son of Dracula is one of the very few movies that I would call a horror / film noir ( I know that film noir isn't necessarily a genre , but humor me here ) . All the film noir trappings are here . To begin with , Son of Dracula has that look generally associated with film noir . Just take a look at the use of shadows and you'll see what I mean . But a better example is Kay Caldwell as the femme fatal and Dracula , of all people , as her dupe . The way Kay uses Dracula to do what she wants would have made even Phyllis Dietrichson proud . Kay uses Dracula to kill her father so she can get the estate and then tricks him into marriage to gain immortality . Finished with Dracula , he becomes disposable . She turns to old flame Frank Stanley to help her destroy Dracula . In the end , all three ? Kay , Dracula , and Frank ? are either dead or damaged beyond repair . Take away the supernatural elements of the story and you've got a typical 1940s film noir . - The cast ? A lot of people tend to focus on Lon Chaney , Jr . , suitability for the role of Dracula . The criticism is almost always related to Chaney's physical appearance . I'm convinced that some of these people can't get past his size long enough to take a look at his performance . And I've always thought of it as a rock solid performance . Equally mysterious is Louise Allbritton in role of the manipulative Kay . She's fantastic as she winds both Dracula and Frank around her finger . As for Robert Paige as the doomed Frank , he's perfect . He plays the tragic figure so well . Beyond these three , the film also features solid supporting performances from Evelyn Ankers , J . Edward Bromberg , and Frank Craven . All are terrific . Everyone involved in the cast really comes out of Son of Dracula looking good . In the end , I do not hesitate to rate Son of Dracula a . Other than some minor quibbles I have with how quickly Dr . Brewster comes to believe in and accept that Dracula is in their presence , the film is near flawless to me . And it gets better with each successive viewing . Watching tonight , I realized I was enjoying it even more now than ever before . It's a great movie !
