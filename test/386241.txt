485785	386241	75097	1.0	Off-putting " thriller " .	Incredibly muddled , off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ( " the horses , oh my God , the horses ! " ) thriller . It's creepy at times , but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film . Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody " magically " does exactly what the plot needs for the " resolution " to occur . Bland performances by the leads , a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch . The video transfer is a real hack job , cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand . stars .
487208	386241	296042	1.0	Utterly worthless .	" Ichi The Killer " ' s violence makes " Reservoir Dogs " look like " Snow White " . Its visual " style " makes MTV video directors look like cutting-edge , brilliant artists . And its plot makes most Steven Seagal story lines seem intelligent . Writing a long review about something so meaningless is meaningless in itself , so I'll sum up the movie in four words : revolting , incomprehensible , numbing , overlong . For anyone who liked , say , " Nekromantik " , it's a sure bet ; for all others . . . stars . P . S . I watched the uncut version on a DVD that included an interview with director Takashi . The guy is a pretty boring talker , too .
486489	386241	140859	2.0	Unwatchable between the fight scenes ; not much better during them	The only possible source of entertainment in a movie like " Bloodfight " is the fighting , but even that is spoiled here by terrible direction , bad camera angles and sloppy editing . The plot rambles on for about an hour , then turns into a tenth-rate " Rocky " . The Oriental actors , burdened with someone's idiotic decision that they should all speak exclusively in English ( in a misconceived attempt to help the film break more easily into the American market , perhaps ? ) , recite their lines robotically , without any feeling . On the other hand , the white actors , who can speak English more fluently , can't act ( only Cristina Lawson comes close to doing both of those things simultaneously ) . " Bloodfight " is only for those who'll watch Bolo Yeung in any film , no matter how atrocious it may be . ( )
485648	386241	109550	2.0	Dead in the water .	" Dark Waters " is the kind of movie that wears out your patience in the first 5 minutes . Every ridiculous horror cliche ( all the nights are rainy ; all the supporting characters are wackos ; old people know " more than they're telling " ; there are candles everywhere ; there are strange burp-like sounds on the soundtrack ; etc . ) gets a workout in this nonsensical mumbo-jumbo-filled ( " the one who was but now isn't and yet is " ) muddle . This comment can't possibly do justice to how bad this movie really is ; it's so bad it's bad ; it's the worst Italian horror film since " The Sect " from 1991 . 0 . 5 out 4 .
486583	386241	83033	2.0	Very bad .	A poor movie - to put it mildly . The misleading title may make you think that this is going to be a parody of the " Friday the 13Th " formula , but it isn't . In fact , it's hard to know what type of movie they're supposed to be spoofing here . Anyway , this film is an appallingly unfunny comedy AND an unscary horror flick , so there's no reason for you to see it . It has one blessing , however , that saved it from the rating ( I gave it a 2 ) : it's very , very short - but still not short enough to camouflage its lack of inspiration .
486977	386241	100581	2.0	Proceed at your own risk .	As a director , Dario Argento may very well be a master of the horror genre . But as a screenwriter , he has already proved that , more often than not , he doesn't have a clue . The script he has co-written for " The Sect " is so awful that I am inclined to believe there wasn't any script to begin with - they were probably making it up as they went along . The movie is simply a series of disconnected scenes that were thrown together in the vain hope that they would form some sort of " plot " . The result is a torturous piece of schlock that bored me to tears . This one should get stars , but I'll change it to 0 . 5 for the cool " face ripping " scene , and for the fun of seeing an aging Giovani Lombardo Radice in a minor role , ten years after " Cannibal Ferox " . Still , it apparently has its fans so you may want to check it out for yourself . . . .
487450	386241	93276	2.0	The strangest . . . and the worst .	" Iron Warrior " introduces a new style both for Ator ( he has black hair now , in a ponytail , and barely utters more than fifty words in the entire movie ) and for the series itself . Director Brescia drops the silliness and campiness of the two D'Amato-directed " Ator " flicks in favor of a pseudo-arty approach . He employs every trick in the book : slow-motion , fast-motion ( ! ) , wide-angle lenses , cheap editing tricks to make people " disappear " , etc . But the result in nothing more than a ponderous , often incomprehensible film that you may have to struggle to get through . The Malta locations are admittedly very beautiful , though . ( )
486797	386241	206826	3.0	Total waste of time	Oh man , what a ripoff ! I rented this movie basically to see Claudia Schiffer . She has no more than 15 minutes of screen time in total , and don't expect to see her in anything racier than a bikini . She isn't exactly a convincing actress , but at least her primary profession is a model - what's Daniel Baldwin's excuse ? At one point he breaks into tears and it's one of the most unconvincing sobbing scenes I've ever seen ! Oh , and did I mention that Coolio plays a prison guard ? ! The only decent acting comes from Sarah Lassez and Kim Rhodes . The movie is filled with laughable situations ( from the sex scene in the PRISON cell against a LADDER to the escape to the breaking into apartments to a bullet in the gut having almost no effect to . . . . ) and twists ( " He's my father ! " ) that would shame a soap opera . The script looks as if it was written by a kid : anything can happen and nobody has to worry about logic . There is one neat directing trick - moving from a postcard to the beach it portrays - but otherwise " In Pursuit " is a total waste of time . ( )
486386	386241	87015	3.0	Cruddy .	This dull and utterly unscary horror film is cruddy in every department and I simply can't believe that some genre fans actually liked it . The fact that it was followed by a sequel ( ! ) also seems inexplicable to me . There are absolutely no scares here - and no gore , either ; our views of the " monsters " are always too brief - but not brief enough to hide how cheap the effects are . " C . H . U . D " is rock-bottom stuff , and no fun at all .
485803	386241	74906	3.0	A fiasco !	This incomprehensible picture simply doesn't make any sense . Considering its cast , it's a real disappointment . Even the two stars aren't very good : Nicholson gives a decent but mediocre performance , while Brando overacts embarrassingly , although it was probably impossible for any actor to play such a badly written role . The scenery is magnificent at times , and Nicholson has a cool line near the end ( beginning with " Do you know what woke you up ? " ) , but the film is still a fiasco .
486068	386241	82084	3.0	Cheap , illogical , sloppy , offensive .	When you make a film with a killer-kids premise , there are two effective ways to approach it ; you can either make it as realistic as possible , creating believable characters and situations , or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs ( something which the makers of " Silent Night , Deadly Night " did , for example , on an equally controversial subject : a killer Santa ) . The people who made " Bloody Birthday " , however , do neither of those things ; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun ( or a knife , or a noose , or an arrow ) in his / her hand . The result is both offensive and stupid . The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production ( and then kept from release for several years ) . It's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids , but it's VERY sloppily made . ( )
487228	386241	82378	3.0	Senseless and unpleasant .	Uneven pacing ( too slow at first , then too rushed ) and senseless plot ( not even a hint is given about the killer's motivation ) spoil what could have been a quite watchable " Friday the 13th " ripoff . The result is much more unpleasant than entertaining .
487021	386241	86143	3.0	Terrible movie . . . steamy seduction scene	The luminous and talented Phoebe Cates wallows in this embarrassing non-movie , which is not worth seeing from beginning to end ( why ? well , for starters , there is no script and no direction ) , but DOES have some scenes that are worth seeing , even worth taping perhaps : you guessed it , I'm talking about the scenes involving Betsy Russell's impressive physical assets . For once , a case of hype that is well deserved . ( )
487429	386241	226919	3.0	Every bit as bad as " Crocodile " .	" It's not like that big mechanical toy " , says a character early on , commenting on " Jaws " . Well , " Blood Surf " would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the " Jaws " series . In other words , the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE . Acting and directing are not much better , either ; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie . The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre , but for the audience too . Saying you " liked " this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap , further destroying the poor horror genre . ( )
486659	386241	70578	4.0	Disappointing thriller .	The ambitious script deserves some credit for the way it keeps intercutting the past with the present tense , a technique that results in some intriguing effects ; in one scene we see somebody killed , in the next scene there he is , moving and talking ! But , the pace of the film is plodding , the performances detached and completely unengaging ( or maybe the characters are detached and completely unengaging ; in any case , you don't sympathize with them ) , the direction too " arty " ( for example , a driving scene with no dialogue runs about five minutes , while one of Karen Black's " melancholy " songs plays on the soundtrack ) . Plus , the VHS print I saw was SEVERELY damaged . ( )
486620	386241	91223	4.0	Low-rent .	Low-rent horror movie with an illogical plot and particularly unconvincing Vietnam flashbacks ( it was all-too-obvious that they were filmed in a studio set ) . Some good comic moments ( especially the hero's meeting with the female neighbour ) can't save this film .
485893	386241	95583	4.0	Nothing you haven't seen before . . .	" Maniac Cop " is made with enough skill to be watchable , but don't look for anything even remotely original or creative here . It's formulaic stuff , just another pretty basic slice-and-dice entry . It probably had been a quite ambitious project , with an indestructible killer in the Michael Myers - Freddy Krueger tradition , but the result is thoroughly routine . ( )
486935	386241	83960	4.0	Utterly predictable .	Before you start viewing an early Chuck Norris flick , you certainly don't have particularly high expectations ; you just want to kill two hours painlessly . " Forced Vengeance " is an utterly predictable , formulaic , often boring action film , yet it generally accomplishes its mission . Norris is as stiff as ever , of course , and there are plenty of hokey fight sequences , often filmed in slow-motion , although I can't quite understand the necessity of that " gimmick " .
485992	386241	801349	4.0	The film drags , but Lorin Becker looks GREAT in a bikini	" Triple Threat " opens with a busty female assassin lounging by the pool , where she receives a call and accepts one last assignment . This beginning ( along with the DVD cover ) teases the viewer with the promise of some girls-with-guns action , but , much like many Andy Sidaris movies , this one promises more than it is ready to deliver ( the assassin spends most of the movie driving around on her bike and doing high-tech computer stuff ) . The problem is not the direction : the film has a reasonably professional look , considering its very low budget . The problem is the script : it has WAY too much filler in it , and the film d-r-a-g-s unbelievably . I see no reason why it had to run 94 minutes , it should have been at least 15 minutes shorter . The good news is that the lead , Lorin Becker , is assured , beautiful and likable , and even though some of the excuses Vasconcellos finds to put her in a bikini are absurd , she looks so good in it it's hard to complain , especially if you appreciate full-figured women . ( )
485596	386241	91499	4.0	Disappointing	This film had a potentially very interesting concept ( all the machines go on a homicidal rampage ) , but didn't exploit very well . Actually , it did for a while , in some quite inventive scenes ( the " violent " soda machine provides the film's most memorable moment ) , but then falls into a repetitive pattern - trucks keep circling around the truck station , attacking intermittently , and the tension never builds . You'd expect to see a lot more cool and varied scenes like the early ones , but this film is actually very limited in scope . ( )
485911	386241	87428	4.0	Almost crap .	They try for something weird , bizarre , unique in this film , but it all goes disastrously wrong - the weirdness seems forced . Right from the opening five minutes you realize that you're stuck for two - seemingly interminable - hours with a collection of unappealing characters and dreary situations , in a movie with a sense of humor that can be described as " self-conscious " at best . There are some interesting moments , of course , but most of the many famous performers are pitifully wasted . ( )
486008	386241	65656	4.0	Poor version of classic story	There is only one good thing about this " Dorian Gray " : Helmut Berger's ideal casting in the title role . Impossibly handsome , he is credible both in his innocence ( early on ) and his corruption ( later on ) . That is the only thing this movie does right , however ; nothing else . The choppy continuity ( Dorian falls in love in the first three minutes . . . he " changes " after twenty minutes . . . and so on ) renders the story shallow and meaningless . The film obviously wants to " suggest " a lot ( including belt-whippings , lesbianism and oral sex ) , but is so tame and timid in doing it that it could possibly get by with a " PG " rating today . By the time Berger drops the soap in his shower and a straight-faced Herbert Lom picks it up , the whole thing has become a farce . I haven't seen the more famous 1945 version , but it has GOT to be better than this one ! ( )
487024	386241	109415	4.0	Don't bother .	Third " Corn " entry , and there is no compelling reason for you to watch it . Although it's slicker than " Part II " , and occasionally displays some originality in the staging of the killings , it is ultimately defeated by its pointlessness . The " evil " boy in the movie seems obsessed with " He Who Walks Behind The Rows " , but we don't share his feelings , and we can't really identify with " the good guys " , either . ( )
487472	386241	78806	4.0	A bore .	Slow , odd film that drags and plods ( I mean really PLODS ) along to its disappointing climax . You may expect some sort of punchline at the end , but there is none . Both Milland and Snodgress give awkward performances ; in fact , the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it . The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts ( like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey ) , and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving . . . . a gorilla . ( )
486254	386241	74670	4.0	A must for all sickos .	Full-frontal nudity ( in " up close and personal " shots ) ; tarantula torture ; flesh-eating ants torture ; breast torture ; arm amputations ; eye gougings ; eviscerations ; bloody beatings ; rape . This is not a film ; it's a catalogue of perversions . It's the first " Ilsa " movie I ever watched , and it's gonna be the last . Surprisingly good photography , though . And also a leading man with the most monotonously droning voice you'll ever hear ; even Charles Bronson shows more enthusiasm with his line readings . ( )
487056	386241	257510	4.0	Terrible , but better than the first .	It seems hard to believe , but this in-name-only " sequel " is actually slightly more fun than the original " Crocodile " . Sure , the digital version of the croc looks as embarrassingly fake as it did the first time around ( Jesus does it look fake ) , though the animatronic model looks OK . And the characters are equally unappealing and / or moronic , but at least some of them have an excuse this time - they're robbers , after all ( one of them even looks like David Hess ! ) . By the way , I spotted at least two references to Tarantino's movies , which must have been intentional . ( )
487435	386241	106342	4.0	A warning for the unprepared .	Since this film has received so much praise , I feel the need to issue a warning here for those who expect a masterpiece . The film is actually pretty difficult to get into . The storytelling is very confusing . For at least the first 45 minutes , I couldn't make heads or tails out of what was happening , who was fighting whom , who all those people were , etc . Perhaps this is a movie meant to be seen and understood completely only by those who have read the novel on which it's based . When an actual story does begin to take form , the film does have some touching and / or disturbing moments ( you get a good look at naked Siamese twins ) , but the much-talked-about violence and action choreography is strictly comic-book-level . This film needed more clarity and narrative skill to be successful . ( )
487372	386241	443473	4.0	Blatantly derivative and disgustingly tasteless , but also surprisingly intelligent at times	" Mean Guns " , " Battle Royale " , " The Eliminator " . . . . this type of story has been done so many times already that the only way a movie that's using it again can be worth the trouble is if a ) it's done REALLY well , or b ) it brings something new to the table . " The Condemned " is not done very well . For one thing , the action scenes are shot with the camera shaking and zooming in and out so much that most of the choreography is lost on the viewer's eyes . The film is also predictable ( it was produced by the WWE , does it take much effort to guess who the last survivor will be ? ) and tasteless ( the treatment of the female contestants is appalling ) . But it also has moments of surprising intelligence and reflexion - particularly in a sequence near the end where the psychopathic Vinnie Jones breaks into the control center of the " game " and shoots up everyone in sight : it's like having the bad guy that you think is " cool " in a movie invade your privacy through your screen and show you the real pain of violence . There are also several good performances in this film , not so much from the contestants as from the people watching them : Victoria Mussett stands out as the girlfriend of the man who sets up the show , not believing her eyes as he goes from a cynical producer to a conscienceless criminal . As for Stone Cold Steve Austin , he has physical presence but not much charisma as a film star ( yet ) ; that's why even his best one-liner ( " Sounds like you had a hard life . . . . good thing it's over now " ) comes across as flat . For all its occasional good points , " The Condemned " leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth . ( )
487487	386241	86192	4.0	Boring .	" Revenge of the Ninja " got a vote of " 4 " from me , which means that it was a considerable improvement ( I think ) over the the exceedingly dull " Enter the Ninja " , to which I gave . It's still not a very good movie , though . Actually , it's only standard , boring kung-fu stuff , with lots of action and a " who-cares " plot . Apparently , the people who made this thought that graphic violence could camouflage the lack of interesting characters and the childish script ( they were wrong ) . As for Sho Kosugi , his fighting skills are no match for those of Bruce Lee , and his acting talents can best be described as " nonexistent " . And was that final , interminable showdown supposed to be exciting ?
486408	386241	94889	4.0	Extremely superficial .	" Cocktail " is a slick , thoroughly empty comedy-drama in the corny-junky tradition of " Dirty Dancing " . The people are all beautiful , the locations gorgeous , and the soundtrack is packed with MTV-style songs . Dramatically , it's just a collection of old cliches and LAUGHABLY old stereotypes ( Shue's typically stupid and stubborn father is very funny ) . The leads are certainly attractive , and Brown is so obviously superior to the rest of the picture that he somewhow never seems to fit in . Overall , an OK diversion , but only if you're prepared for how cliched and superficial it is .
486734	386241	95626	5.0	An OK change-of-pace for Bronson .	Bronson is rather miscast as a reporter ( who still can punch and defeat any opponent ) , but this is one of his least typical and most solid vehicles from the 80's . It begins with a weird , effectively staged massacre and includes some offbeat elements along with the familiar ones . It's still nothing special , though . It's one of those curiously forgettable films that keep you interested while you're watching them , but leave no lasting impression .
486267	386241	156408	5.0	Well-directed but pretty ho-hum French thriller	Using dreams as a means of expressing a character's hidden fears and desires is an old trick , and Claude Miller overdoes it ; there are probably more dream sequences than actual events in this movie . Some of them are startling ( one involving a severed talking head , another a machine-gun massacre ) , but the story is boring ( you don't have to be a detective to figure out the truth ) , and the kid is boring , too , with a fixed stare that never changes throughout the film ( though it's probably not his fault , but Miller's ) . " La Classe De Neige " belongs in a subgenre that could be called " the world from a child's point of view " , but doesn't make its way into the top of the list . ( )
486744	386241	30696	5.0	Big disappointment .	A big disappointment from the Marx Brothers . The few and weak " memorable quotes " simply indicate the low level of invention in this stagey picture . Groucho Marx in particular looks tired and indifferent . Harpo seems to be in a happier mood , but he has hardly enough screen time . It's hard to believe it , but this Marx film is at times downright boring .
486334	386241	87796	5.0	You've seen it all before .	Toxic chemical fluid infects the residents of a small Southern town , turning them into mutated , bloodthirsty monsters . So what else is new ? This totally ordinary film ( technically not a zombie flick , though the monsters do look a lot like zombies ) , has good acting by Wings Hauser and Bo Hopkins and OK special effects , but . . . . . you've seen it all before . Lots of Southern stereotypes , too . ( )
486466	386241	105399	5.0	Terrible but fun .	By any objective standards , this movie is absolutely terrible . The direction is extremely sloppy , the " special effects " ( though undeniably time-consuming ) are pathetically obvious and the script . . . well , let's just not go there . Nevertheless , it does boast some witty , top-notch fight choreography and some legitimately funny moments , so Jackie fanatics may want to give it a look . But if you're new to Hong Kong action cinema , don't make " Twin Dragons " your introduction to it : you'll have a hard time believing that a movie this bad can actually be produced anywhere in this world . ( )
487315	386241	83755	5.0	A grim , straightforward WIP drama	" The Concrete Jungle " doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before , but it's still an absorbing , fairly well-made & acted little Women-In-Prison drama . What the fans of this sub-genre need to know is that the filmmakers have taken a mostly serious-minded approach here , at least until the last 10 minutes when a massive fight that breaks out in the prison yard turns into a mudbath ! Most of the time , though , the film simply chronicles , in a straightforward manner , the daily struggle for survival of a 100 % innocent woman who tries to adapt to the harsh prison life . Tracey Bregman's sweet , innocent-looking face is perfect for the part , and she is surrounded by actresses who mostly manage , in a short amount of time , to build their own characters . The standout for me was June Barret as the bad girl Icy , who is both strong and insecure . ( )
487325	386241	108588	5.0	OK film with wooden acting .	Moderately interesting mystery tale , but hampered by some unclear plot points and wooden performances by the three main leads ( Robert Mitchum , in a supporting role , towers above them all ) . Bo Derek is in great shape for a woman in her late thirties , but she's totally expressionless ; still , it's the smug Steven Bauer that ranks at the top of the bad-acting list . Sex-wise , there is really only one scene worth mentioning ( on a motorcycle ) , but at least it's a memorably bold one . ( )
486812	386241	95296	5.0	Very minor .	Chuck Norris is better than usual here . He's still not much of an actor , but at least he gets the rare chance to portray some human emotions like fear and doubt , and he also gets to flash his appealing smile . But the rest of the movie is a tiresome , familiar cop thriller ( with slasher-flick overtones ) , and it's amazingly skimpy on plot . The climax does not meet our expectations , either . ( )
486271	386241	109515	5.0	Trivial " Terminator " rip-off .	This is the first Don " The Dragon " Wilson movie I have ever seen , and nothing propels me to try out another one - sure , he is good at martial arts , but as an actor he has an uncharismatic screen presence . There's plenty of action in this film , with a new explosion every two minutes , and the effects are decent ( considering the low budget ) , but the final Wilson vs . Richard Norton ( a villain in some Jackie Chan movies also ) showdown is the only notable fight scene . stars if you look at this as a " normal " film , if you look at it as a " B-movie " .
485599	386241	83034	5.0	Passable	Imagine " The Birds " or " Night of The Living Dead " , but with lions instead of birds and zombies , and you'll have a pretty good idea of what this movie is like . Rather passable stuff , except for some unintentionally funny scenes ( like the sight of lions entering the house through the chimney or walking on the kitchen sink ) . Pretty good acting , too - both by the lions and by Tom Skerrit . ( )
486570	386241	236638	5.0	Weird , slow , indifferently dubbed and ultimately ludicrous .	The director of " Deep in the Woods " shows a strong sense of visual style ( there is , for example , a point-of-view shot from inside a bag ! ) , but it's all for naught . This movie is a real mess ; people appear out of nowhere and disappear into nowhere , and the main characters are a little too dumb , even for typical horror-movie " heroes " . Give this director a decent script , and we might actually be onto something . As a side note , the stage play these kids set up is terrible enough to turn anyone into a killer . ( )
486564	386241	74442	5.0	Silly .	Silly slapstick comedy is both sluggish and childish ( let's just say that it's less realistic than the average " Police Academy " sequel ) , but Terence Hill , with his acrobatic skills and use of everyday objects in the fight scenes , comes through as a somewhat slower version of Jackie Chan , and Bud Spencer's reactions and mutterings earn some laughs . ( )
485859	386241	86960	5.0	Cliched , brainless but watchable .	If one of the characteristics of a great film is that is stands the test of time , then " Beverly Hills Cop " is by no means a great film . Almost everything about this comedy-actioner looks already dated today , including Eddie Murphy's persona . Although there are undeniably some comic highlights , the movie is sunk by its painfully cliched and unoriginal script which makes it feel programmed and destroys all the suspense elements . But Steven Berkoff makes a calmly effective villain and the film is OK fare if you're undemanding . ( )
486200	386241	113926	5.0	Naked Pamela	Taken as a sci-fi thriller , " Naked Souls " lies somewhere between " mediocre " and " not bad " . The ideas ( mind-switching , memory transfer , etc ) are intriguing , even if they have been used in many other films ( the French thriller " La Machine " , with Depardieu , is one that comes to mind ) , but this film goes nowhere with them . However , Pamela Anderson looks breathtakingly gorgeous here ( I don't remember ever seeing her look better ) , and she has one particularly sensual sex scene ( damn was her partner a lucky guy ! ) . The filmmakers must have liked that scene too , because they repeat it in the last few minutes . . . . and it's actually better the second time because it's not intercut ( like it is the first time ) with David Warner's reactions . No disrespect to Warner , who is a fine actor , but he kind of kills the mood in this instance , if you know what I mean . . . . ( )
485652	386241	284867	5.0	In-your-face .	This gory remake of an old Pam Grier vehicle is shot in an extremely annoying pseudo-MTV-ish style ( color filters , quick cuts and flashes , overamplified sounds ) , but if you take it strictly as an assault on the senses , it is partly effective . Lisa Dergan ( the blonde ) completely outshines her co-star in the acting as well as in the looks department . ( )
485667	386241	105569	5.0	" What the hell is going on here ? " ( actual quote ) .	I found this movie slightly better than the first " Tetsuo " ( which I HATED ) , mainly because it appears at first to be willing to tell a more coherent ( if still unique ) story . Soon , however , the story disappears into a farrago of violence , mayhem and senselessness ; by the time the completely baffling ending arrives , you've already given up trying to make sense out of what's happening . However , there are some ingenious special effects and a breakneck chase scene that's worth seeing . ( )
487246	386241	121074	5.0	A disappointment for Cynthia Khan fans	This is only the third Cynthia Khan film I've seen so far , and I'm already a big fan of hers - but how could I not be ? She is a gorgeous woman , a good fighter , and a decent actress . In fact , I'm giving " Angel on Fire " a " out of 4 " rating basically thanks to her , because it probably deserves less . The plot is incoherent ( with more different groups of villains than you'll be able to count ) , the editing is choppy , and the fighting , while good in spots ( the woman who plays the thief arguably steals the show ) , is not up to par with that you can find in the " In The Line Of Duty " films with Cynthia . And making matters worse , my version was a subtitled one BUT with often illiterate ( " How dare you are ! " ) and unreadable ( especially when the backgrounds are white ) subtitles . A substandard presentation of a substandard movie .
486064	386241	90630	5.0	A fairly intelligent stupid movie .	I don't know exactly what to make of this . It's pretty obvious that you're not supposed to take it seriously , yet for a comedy it has far too much mayhem and not enough laughs . It's all quite stupid , really , and you might be tempted to shut it off even before the opening credits have finished rolling . But it has at least one charming sequence ( when the female leader discovers for the first time what a " man " is ) , and some of the final scenes , showing the aftermath of a devastating battle , with fields littered with corpses , have a surprising impact . Be warned , however , that the movie DOES feature a shaggy mutant called " Aargh The Awful " ! ( )
487139	386241	86050	5.0	Agreeable stuff . . .	This one isn't quite as bad as you might expect . A cheap , schlocky horror movie that offers nothing new to the genre but remains watchable most of the time , thanks to fairly good direction and OK ( considering the low budget ) special effects . The climactic attack of the zombies is poorly handled , and the script seems to ignore the factor of " motivation " , but the movie is still acceptable .
486021	386241	94750	5.0	A poor man's James Bond	Playing a cross between James Bond and Jackie Chan , Sho Kosugi is likable enough , but unlike Jackie when he does a stunt the camera is too far away from him and it's hard to know if he is doubled or not ( if you stick around for the end credits , you'll discover that he WAS doubled on at least two occasions ) , and unlike Bond the action of the movie is limited to one location ( Malta ) most of the time , plus there isn't too much of it . Jean Claude Van Damme makes an awesome villain , but his two major showdowns with Kosugi are rather disappointing . In the role of a female CIA agent , Doran Clark handles her two opportunities for action capably - she should have gotten more . The funniest thing about this film is that Kosugi shows little chemistry with his on-screen kids , even though they are his kids in real life as well ! ( )
486051	386241	66993	5.0	Noise and chaos .	Is it perhaps the film's admittedly powerful ending that makes people so willing to forget just how chaotic and dull most of this picture is ? Yes , you read that right : dull ! The scenes simply don't hang together . Russell is at his best in the few " visionary " sequences ( like those where Vanessa Redgrave imagines Oliver Reed as Jesus Christ , walking on water and , later , coming down from the cross to kiss her ) , but he's at his worst when he has to shoot one scene that must follow the previous one clearly and logically . ( )
485949	386241	59282	5.0	Slight Supposed Spy Spoof	" Hot Enough For June " tries to be both a James Bond spoof AND a serious spy thriller , but in truth it contains very little humor and very little action . What it does have is a lot of cold war espionage - it certainly feels more like a real spy movie than any Bond film of the period , with the notable exception of " From Russia With Love " . At the end , the real aim of the film seems to be to reveal the pointlessness and futility of the typical spy games . But since what we just watched WAS a typical spy game , the film ends up feeling pointless and futile itself ! Dirk Bogarde is fine as the reluctant spy , Robert Morley is fun as essentially an " M " figure , and the unspeakably gorgeous Sylva Koscina , who starred in several spy movies of this period , reminds us once again what a shame it was that she never got to be a real Bond girl - she would have easily ranked among the Top 3 . ( )
486360	386241	95726	6.0	Too bland .	The writer and director , Alan Alda ( who also stars , sporting an unflattering haircut ) , enters Woody Allen territory here , but the result is unfortunately bland and forgettable . He seems to know all the right moves and maintains an agreeable tone , but there isn't enough wit in the lines , or enough laughs , or enough insights into the characters . Ann-Margret does look sensational , however . ( )
486248	386241	95742	6.0	One of the best - highly imaginative !	" Nightmare on Elm Street 4 " is one of the best entries in the series . Okay , the first is considered a classic , maybe because it had a feeling of poetic surrealism that is indeed lost here . But , come on , it is the FOURTH Freddy film , did you REALLY expect it to be scary ? Freddy delivers indeed too many puns , however some of them actually hit the mark . After all , the quality of a slasher film doesn't depend exclusively on how " serious " and " vicious " the killer is - he was more serious in " Part 2 " , which was an embarrassment , he was less serious in " Part 3 " , which was an imaginative , entertaining film . As for " Part 4 " , it has way-above-average acting , a polished look ( just compare it to some early " Friday The 13th " cheapies ) and some gruesome , stunning visual effects . Above all , the movie exploits more possibilities about the links between reality and dreams than the " classic " original did . It is worth seeing .
486151	386241	65206	6.0	Page's acting saves this film	It takes quite some effort to get used to the grainy visuals and the ( initially ) confusing storytelling of this movie , but Geraldine Page's performance eventually puts it across : it's ( the performance , not the movie , unfortunately ) scary , uncompromising and totally convincing . Some suspenseful scenes here , but nothing terribly memorable . . . . ( )
487464	386241	61385	6.0	Light but spirited .	Featherweight , thin comedy is nonetheless enjoyable and extremely watchable . Predictable , to be sure , with often juvenile jokes and some simplistic " dramatic " moments , but the stars are very appealing and the general feel-good spirit of the film may actually cheer you up . Excellent underplaying by Redford . ( )
487159	386241	95389	6.0	Disappointing . . . . ( SPOILERS )	I didn't much like this movie . It's odd and unusual enough to keep you off-balance , but the plot has some gaps and unexplained parts . . . . . ( SPOILERS FOLLOW ) Early on , we see a man committing a most brutal murder , but ultimately it is revealed that the " Ripper " is someone else . The whole behavior of the first man strikes me as inexplicable . Perhaps there is a curious kind of connection , a bond between the two killers , but it is never made clear . This script looks like a part of a greater whole that we don't get to see . ( )
485786	386241	210075	6.0	Rodriguez is worth watching ; the movie , however , isn't .	Michelle Rodriguez gave an amazingly naturalistic performance in " Girlfight " - she's a real talent . But her character is utterly unsympathetic throughout , and what's worse , the filmmakers don't seem willing to acknowledge that and set her up as the heroine . They argue that the right place for a stuck-up girl who can't control her violent urges , thinks the whole world owes her something and likes solving her problems by punching people in the face is the boxing ring - I say it's the loony bin . The romantic subplot is trite and shallow - Rodriguez and Douglas fall " deeply " in love after meeting twice . Good performance by Joe Mantegna look-alike ( and act-alike ) Jaime Tirelli , as the coach . ( )
487069	386241	83806	6.0	A witty but convoluted thriller .	Incredibly convoluted mystery-thriller is highlighted by witty dialogue ( " Well , it's not what you'd call involuntary homicide " ) but has a few TOO many twists . Caine gives another astonishing performance , but I've watched " Deathtrap " three times and that " stormy " resolution always seems barely comprehensible .
487432	386241	95348	6.0	Sometimes funny , could've been funnier .	This movie has some undeniably funny moments , but overall it's not in the league of " Naked Gun " . The jokes don't come fast enough . And although you're not supposed to take this sort of thing seriously , you may get the feeling that the movie trivializes some serious problems ( like drug addiction and youth gangs ) by making fun of them . Still , any movie that features both Jim Brown AND Isaac Hayes ( with a few notes of his classic " Shaft " theme to boot ) is at least worth a look . ( )
487413	386241	118100	6.0	Interesting but uneven and overlong .	This film has a complex , multi-layered structure that grabs your interest . . . but not much substance underneath . There's no real mystery to the plot , and no real revelations about " human nature " either . Well-acted all around - including a little boy who is wise way beyond his years . ( )
487133	386241	91778	6.0	OK rehash .	This fair sequel to " Poltergeist " is better than the original in many respects ( performances , humor , scare factor ) . But it's burdened with a stupid script that destroys most of its chances . Julian Beck has a particularly threatening screen presence , but he seems to belong in a GENUINE horror movie and not in this just-acceptable rehash . . .
487453	386241	39631	6.0	Chaplin and Black Comedy : an uneasy encounter .	One of Chaplin's most ambitious films , but today more interesting for its historical importance than for its actual content . It gets better as it goes along , gradually building to some cleverly staged comic sequences , but it is morally vague , rather stagey and , worst of all , awfully protracted ; we have to wait for a long time to get to the good stuff . This film is mostly a matter of taste . The outstanding performance is not given by Chaplin , but by Martha Raye , who , not coincidentally , is in most of the movie's best sequences . ( )
487312	386241	113313	6.0	Quirky action-comedy with quite possibly THE sexiest woman of the 90's	I don't know if it's her hairstyle ( short hair looks great on some women - she is clearly one of them ) , or her soft makeup , or her attitude , or the way she handles a gun , or the way she fights . It's probably a combination of all of the above that makes Tia Carrere SO sexy in this movie it's distracting - you may find yourself focusing too much on her and not paying enough attention to the rest of the movie . Thomas Ian Griffith shows a flair for self-spoofing , a quality I always appreciate in an action hero , and Donald Sutherland clearly had a good time playing an eccentric , soft-spoken assassin . A quirky sense of humor , occasionally amusing dialogue ( " When did you stop trusting me ? " " January 30 , 1968 " ) and some big explosions add up to an unpretentious and generally fun little action-comedy . ( )
485665	386241	78740	6.0	Actually , it's watchable .	The fourth and last " Airport " movie is not really too bad ; it nearly drowns in soap-opera cliches at times , but some of the action scenes are decently spectacular ( especially near the end , when decompression slowly tears the plane apart ) . The people who made this obviously knew that they weren't going to be taken very seriously , and that the film wasn't destined to become a classic , but at least they didn't try to rip the audience off ; they cared enough to deliver a watchable movie . And it's nice to see George Kennedy calm and relaxed for once . ( )
486176	386241	69729	6.0	Pam Grier and Margaret Markov - what more is there to say ?	I wish there were more actresses out there like Pam Grier . A very pretty face , a wonderful body , a tough attitude and surprisingly mature acting for a woman who was , when this " Arena " was made , only 24 years old . And Margaret Markov , her co-star here , is not far behind in any of those categories . The biggest virtue of this film are those two characters - strong , well-defined , acted with conviction . Others have compared the " Arena " with Roger Corman's WIP flicks , but the treatment of the subjects here is much more thoughtful and non-exploitative . As for the actual fight scenes , considering that most of these women probably had not touched a sword before in their lives , they did a fairly good job . Too bad the DVD is full-screen , which damages the compositions severely . ( )
485626	386241	95834	6.0	Kinky and bizarre .	OK , I admit it : I rented this movie only because it has Eva Grimaldi in it ; well , Eva has only a minor , virtually non-speaking part , and the film is far from the conventional erotic thriller you might expect based on the video box promotion . It's really not a very good movie , but it's unlike anything you've ever seen before . Part kinky soft-core sex film , part murder mystery , set in a vaguely futuristic world , it is a very strange , very arty film , with some bizarre music ( " The Man I Love " ! ) and casting ( female bodybuilder Teagan as . . . herself ) choices . It's obvious that one of the goals of this movie was to create ( with limited means ) its own world ; it succeeded admirably . By the way , did the person who said that " it wants to be like " Basic Instinct " " bother to check out its production date ? ( )
486760	386241	104823	6.0	Respectable low-budget martial arts film	The plot is nothing new ( police corruption , a crime syndicate that uses a night club as a front , a cop investigating the death of his partner , etc . ) but the fight scenes range from good to very good ( the best one might be an illegal 2-on-1 that doesn't involve any of the leads ) . Maybe they can't match up to the best that Hong Kong has to offer , but they are choreographed in a way that showcases the fighters ' power , speed and technique . My two main disappointments with this film are : 1 ) as already reported by another reviewer , VERY short final fight between Cynthia Rothrock and the female bodyguard ( what a bummer ! ) , and 2 ) no arch-villain role for the master of such roles , Billy Drago ( he's just a corrupted police chief ) . ( )
486574	386241	113855	6.0	Good of its type .	Although I've never actually played the game , I found this movie surprisingly entertaining . It had plenty of visual pyrotechnics to keep the viewer interested , some impressively shot fight scenes ( the standouts ? Johnny Cage vs Scorpio and Kang vs Reptile ) and a comic , spoofy flair that worked as the perfect antidote to the moments of solemnity . Except for Lambert ( who is awful ) and Bridgette Wilson ( who is beautiful but can't act ) , the cast is adequate , with a particularly likable performance by Linden Ashby as the sarcastic Johnny Cage . And what a pulsating music score ! ( )
486065	386241	74806	6.0	All setup , no payoff .	Jodie Foster is indeed impressively good in this movie , and she is perhaps the only actress who could have pulled off such a challenging role at such a young age . However , the script is disappointing . It's the kind of story that keeps you watching by implying that many big revelations will be made , and when the revelations do arrive they prove to be less-than-shocking . There's only one moment in the film ( when the seemingly vanished father appears ) that it looks like there's gonna be a REAL SURPRISE , but that moment lasts only about 20 seconds , in which you have enough time to guess what is actually happening . Worth seeing only for Foster , and for her co-stars who are all very good , too . ( )
486440	386241	417248	6.0	Gail Kim , where are you ?	Your opinion about this PPV will largely depend on your opinion about the Shawn Michaels vs . Triple H match , since it takes up almost a third ( ! ) of the total running time . Seven matches are presented : 1 ) La Resistance vs . Edge and Chris Benoit ( for the tag-team title ) . A regular tag-team match , Edge gets it most of the time , Benoit comes to his rescue . . . and then Kane enters the scene and attacks them both , interrupting the match . No ending , thus no rating . 2 ) Chris Jericho vs . Tyson Tomko ( with Trish Stratus ) . Mediocre match with a lame finish : Tomko has the advantage , but he accidentally runs into Trish and Jericho knocks him out with a kick . 3 ) Shelton Benjamin vs . Randy Orton ( for the intercontinental title ) . A very long match , incorporating many different styles of combat ( ground wrestling , acrobatic moves , even boxing ) . Some crucial interferences by Ric Flair ( what a surprise ! ) . ) Trish Stratus vs . Gail Kim vs . Victoria vs . Lita ( for the women's title ) . The " sudden death , fatal 4-way " concept doesn't work . Each woman gets only one or two opportunities to shine , and the action is hard-to-follow . Gail Kim , in particular , deserved better ( by the way , they had a woman who looks AND wrestles like that and they let her go ? What were they thinking ? ) . 5 ) Eugene vs . Jonathan Coachman . I expected this to be garbage , and I was right . A disgrace . ) Chris Benoit vs . Kane ( for the heavyweight title ) . I agree that THIS should have been the main event . Kane is awesome here ; he's like a comic-book creation . The match is pretty slow , but the sheer physical power ( Kane ) and technique ( Benoit ) on display make it worth your while . 7 ) Triple H vs . Shawn Michaels . " Hell in a cell " match . This one is a matter of taste . If you like them bloody , brutal and exhausting , you'll have a field day . If not , you'll probably find it ( after a while ) boring and interminable ( it goes on for almost 50 minutes ! ) .
486554	386241	102067	6.0	Continues the upward course of the series ( after the good " V " )	A werewolf movie with an unconventional angle : you actually want the werewolf to prevail in this one . It has an air of mystery and at times it's very compelling , but the climactic " battle of the beasts " is kind of silly . Still , it's miles ahead of Parts " II " , " III " and " IV " . ( )
486035	386241	86618	6.0	More swordfights than laughs .	" Yellowbeard " has some funny moments , but with THIS cast , it should have been much better . There is perhaps too much attention to the production values , at the expense of comedy . The " plot " is cluttered and chaotic . And Monty Python fans will probably be disappointed because , although the film has many of their members in big or small roles , it never makes the leap to surrealism ( come on , couldn't they have come up with some clever jokes during the title cards ? ) . However , as I said , there are enough funny moments for this to get a rating .
486118	386241	90917	6.0	OK horror from Craven .	A few people have said that it's an undiscovered treasure , more people have stated that it's possibly Wes Craven's worst movie ( haven't they seen " Shocker " ? ) ; I simply found it to be an OK , average horror offering that merely helps you kill two hours . The first half plays almost like a well-observed drama , but after Swanson has been " resurrected " the film becomes just too silly to work . The " infamous " basketball scene , however , is undeniably great ; you'll have to rewind the tape multiple times to get the full effect of it ! ( )
485601	386241	114508	6.0	Kind of cool and pleasant . . . . .	" Species " has a hopelessly derivative premise that makes it a completely unnecessary view for anyone who has ever seen " Alien " or " The Predator " ( or their sequels ) , but it does have some things going for it . To be short and specific : Natasha Henstridge is dreamily , extraordinarily beautiful ; the rest of the cast is distinguished , with a very cool Michael Madsen stealing the show ; the special effects are convincingly yucky ; and the pacing is fast and unrelenting , with the " search-and-destroy " team being always only one step behind the pursued alien " monster " . A forgettable film , but not nearly as bad as many reviews have suggested . ( )
487286	386241	75995	6.0	The story of a boy who prefers horses to Jenny Agutter ( if you can imagine that ! )	This movie is never boring , that must be said . Although it runs 138 minutes , it feels more like 98 . BUT . . . . its " message " is dubious at best ( there is a difference between non-conformity and sheer paranoia ; the boy's actions are never condemned , and almost justified by the movie ) and the " devices " used by Lumet to transfer the play to the screen ( like flashbacks with an older Firth playing the six-year-old Firth , or Burton's madman-like monologues ) create an extra feeling of artificiality . Also , it would help if we could study the gradual disintegration of the boy's mind , but there is no " gradual " - he is deranged from the start . ( )
486036	386241	35279	7.0	With a better lead , this could've been a classic .	An entertaining first draft for " North By Northwest " , " Saboteur " has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments ( one of the best occurs at a table , when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing handcuffs , to give her a plate ; trying to do that , he also drops a knife to the floor , exposing himself even more ! ) but suffers from a poorly chosen lead ( whether he's delivering patriotic speeches , romancing Priscilla Lane , making jokes or trying to look worried , Robert Cummings is wooden ) , and from a lack of really distinct villains ( oh , there are villains , many of them , but hardly anyone has enough screen time ) . ( )
487543	386241	95403	7.0	Superb action and serious Jackie !	" Police Story 2 " is a movie that mostly shows Jackie Chan's serious side . His performance is relatively mature and restrained , and he allows his character to be portrayed as not only brave , smart and determined , but flawed and selfish as well ( his scene with Maggie Cheung after the fight in the playground is a key point ) . There is less slapstick and more plot than usual for a Chan movie ; less emphasis on comedy and more on action . The action sequences are superb , and that deaf-mute guy with the incredible martial-arts skills is one of the most memorable villains Jackie ever had to face ( literally : I had seen the film only once before in 1997 and I still remembered him clearly ) . ( )
486524	386241	69895	7.0	A little too frantic , but a must for Romero fans .	One of Romero's least-seen efforts , this film is well-made on a low budget , but the frenzied pacing , the documentary-type directing techniques and the unsympathetic characters leave you with nobody to root for . More cruel than bloody , and especially interesting for those who want to study Romero's career more closely , as it has both the nihilism of " Night of the Living Dead " and the strong anti-military spirit of " Day of the Dead " . Worth seeing . ( )
486463	386241	22395	7.0	Not typical Hitchcock , but not bad .	Technical crudities , print / sound deficiencies and dated acting styles taken into consideration , " Skin Game " still has innovative ( for the time ) camera techniques and thematic ambiguity ( who is right and who is wrong ? Who are the true villains of the story ? ) and is generally better than other , more " typical " Hitchcock films of the period , like " Murder ! " from 1930 . Edmund Gwenn is terrific and Phyllis Constam is quite sexy . ( )
487045	386241	109093	7.0	Likably offbeat fare .	Hal Hartley's " Amateur " is an engagingly offbeat take on the " crime thriller " genre . It is also perhaps the most quietly thoughtful handling of amnesia ( not as a plot trick , but as a subject ) you're ever likely to see . But be warned : Hartley's refreshingly non-mainstream , detached , minimalist style takes quite some getting used to , and the ending is needlessly downbeat . ( )
487153	386241	100442	7.0	Nolte at his most imposing !	Extremely well-written and colorful dialogue . Grainy , gritty cinematography that gives the film an extra authentic feel . Good performances . Nick Nolte , bigger and more towering than ever before , as the ultimate Bad Cop . This is a worthwhile movie , and it would make a great " police corruption " double bill with the same year's " Internal Affairs " ( a topic for discussion : who is scarier as a villain , Nolte or Richard Gere ? ) . Only problem is that the film is a bit overloaded with supporting characters , making the plot unnecessarily complex at times . ( )
487368	386241	74811	7.0	Fascinating but overly drab .	A sometimes fascinating but very drab and oh-so-slow psychological thriller from Roman Polanski . He tells his story methodically and allows the viewer to share the hero's point of view ; on the other hand , this also has some unfortunate consequences : the pacing is torturously , almost unbearably slow . This film may indeed be a superb study of paranoia , but the tension doesn't get going until it's too late and I found the scenes where Polanski dresses himself up as a woman somewhat hokey . ( )
485898	386241	71532	7.0	Engrossing .	A grim and intelligent drama that offers a seemingly accurate portrayal of the gambling obsession and an engrossing character study of a man that suffers from it . Very well-acted and well-told as a story , it remains highly interesting from start to finish . Marred only by its weird , inconclusive and somewhat inexplicable ending . ( )
486462	386241	82436	7.0	Excellent performances , weak plot .	Though the story is essentially routine , and the " surprise " ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience , you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine , and shine they do . The film is impeccably made - for its time . It was remade in 2000 as " Under Suspicion " and if you only want to see one version of the story ( that's all it deserves , really ) , I recommend the latter one , with Hopkins ' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at . The ending , however , still blows . ( )
485812	386241	86873	7.0	A pleasant diversion - but a little overrated .	Lightweight , enjoyable comedy , with first-rate performances by Martin and Tomlin . The supporting cast is adequate and there are some genuine ( if scattered ) laughs . However , the film is nothing more than a pleasant little diversion . Every time I watch it , the same thing bothers me : it looks very cheap and underproduced , with murky cinematography . It has an inexplicable TV-movie feel , which certainly doesn't do justice to the actors ' terrific work .
486042	386241	60288	7.0	Above average .	This above-average Bond knockoff deserves to be better known . It's too imitative of the Bond pictures of the time ( especially " Thunderball " - minus the underwater scenes ) , and the plot slows down at times , but Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina make a terrific pair of sexy , teasing assassins ( with Sommer being the sexier one and Koscina the more teasing one ) . Nigel Green also makes a smooth villain ( although he should have hired more guards ! ) . This picture should become more widely available , because although it's not perfect , it's much better than , say , the atrocious pseudo-spoof " Our Man Flint " . ( )
486669	386241	60315	7.0	Not great , but certainly fun .	This fun , ultra-violent Western is very close to the Leone-spaghetti style . Franco Nero is no Clint Eastwood , of course , but he's an acceptable substitute ( although he's hampered by the fact that his voice is dubbed , which is a pity because Nero's own voice is one of his best features ) . No masterpiece , but has hardly a dull moment . ( )
485895	386241	86543	7.0	Not for the easily offended .	Offbeat , slow-paced , entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and " blasphemous " scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers . However , it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains , or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance . Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film , playing with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens . Unfortunately , in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur , and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie . ( )
486022	386241	95174	7.0	Gripping but flawed .	This Polanski thriller is flawlessly acted , fairly gripping and it sustains your interest throughout . Still , it doesn't really meet our expectations in the plot department . As a reviewer on the " Amazon . com " page points out , you expect something " deeper and darker " than a more or less standard spy plot .
486467	386241	235737	7.0	A true attention-getter of a film .	Excellent adult thriller . Stylish , intense , funny and unexpectedly moving . Intricately plotted ( it will always be one step ahead of you ) and fluidly , inventively directed ( including a unique twist on Eastwood's classic " Did I fire six bullets . . . or only five ? " line ) . Well-acted , especially by Kilmer . The less you know about it beforehand the better , though , so I'll just add this : this film is not always pleasant to watch , but it has personality and will take you on quite a journey . Don't read about it , see it . ( )
487290	386241	66769	7.0	You'll have to strain a bit . . .	Robert Wise's solemn approach is so unentertaining that the few humorous moments stand out as brief , merciful doses of relief . However , I must admit that the film has great set design , believable performances and a suspenseful climax - not to mention those " oh , so 70s " heavy " government - conspiracy - paranoia " overtones . ( )
486017	386241	339489	7.0	A brain-twister of a film ; worth sticking with	The previous reviewer pretty much said what I wanted to say : " Killing Words " is a difficult film to categorize , but if you have to place it under one genre , it's probably what they call a " mind-fk " . Twist upon twist upon twist - that's how this film proceeds . It constantly plays with your perceptions ; just when you thing you've figured it all out , it proves you wrong . There are only four characters , and they are all effectively performed ( and yes : Goya Toledo IS a sensual woman ) . The film is also stylishly directed and photographed . One minor point : the word game that Grandinetti and Toledo frequently play won't mean much to non-Spanish-speaking audiences . But Spanish is such a pleasant language to listen to anyway that this doesn't matter much . ( )
485594	386241	36613	7.0	Funny but uneven	There were some very funny moments and situations in this movie , but overall I find it to be a somewhat uneven and overlong ( 115 minutes ) comedy . Though it builds a delirious , chaotic atmosphere very convincingly , with characters that get nuttier by the minute , it still isn't as good as it could've been . I find Cary Grant's overacting much more justifiable now that I've watched the picture twice ( the first time , you may not be prepared for how crazy he acts ) , and there are many moments of inspired teamwork ( great underplaying by Peter Lorre , and John Alexander is perfect ) - but isn't Raymond Massey a little too gloomy and menacing for a comedy , even a " black " one ?

486566	386241	39305	8.0	Engrossing , if somewhat confusing .	A well-made mystery / film noir . Bogart is in top form , Scott is as glamorous as any given femme fatale of the period , and Carnovsky is smooth as the well-spoken villain . The direction is no more than workmanlike , but the dialogue is superior throughout . My favorite line : " Maybe she was all right . . . and maybe Christmas comes in July , but I doubt it ! " ( )
485886	386241	113350	8.0	Not to be missed	" Red Wolf " gets off to a rather shaky start , but once the action kicks in , it is nonstop . The fight scenes are among the best I've ever seen ; they are on the level of the rooftop climax of Jackie Chan's " Who Am I ? " , except they're not limited to one sequence , but they occur every 5 minutes or so . There is also a lot of shooting , and A LOT of shattered glass . But it's not a mindless movie ; the characters often have to use their smarts to escape from sticky situations . Kenny Ho is a great fighter , full of intensity and conviction , and he appears to be doing all of his own stunts . Elaine Lui ( who plays the BAD girl , NOT the hero's sidekick as others have said ) is absolutely dazzling , a goddess of evil . Judging this movie on its own terms , I give it out of 4 stars . Sure , it's an " Under Siege " rip-off , but that's no reason to miss it .
486864	386241	55824	8.0	Solid thriller .	" Cape Fear " is a solid , suspenseful thriller with a taut script and a terrific performance by Robert Mitchum , as a smart , leering sadist ( with obvious pedophiliac tendencies ) . I had watched the remake ( twice ) before finally seeing this , and it's hard to compare them objectively , because the rules of the censors were much more strict in 1962 ( as the director himself points out in an interview ) . It IS a violent and suggestive film , though ; they probably went about as far as they could at the time . What gives the remake an extra " edge " is that the lawyer is actually guilty of not providing a proper defense for the criminal he was assigned to , while here he is simply a witness to one of his crimes . But this is still a good film , and Herrmann's score is equal to the one he wrote for " Psycho " . ( )
486511	386241	63663	8.0	Rich , moving , beautifully made .	" The Swimmer " must rank among the most beautifully filmed pictures of its era ; few other 60s films featured such vibrant cinematography and such revolutionary ( for the time ) camerawork ( notice the scene in which a horse is reflected in Lancaster's eye ) . Lancaster gives a subtle , powerful performance ( " I'm a noble and splendid man " ) , which is perhaps his best . The film is a tad TOO elliptical , as I think that a little more background information about the central character would have made it slightly more satisfying . And the ending , which was perhaps meant to be a surprise , seems pretty transparent now , as there are many clues which point to it . However , this is still a moving , adult film , which deserves to be seen at least once . ( )
487144	386241	120401	8.0	Inventive and disturbing , but with flaws .	" The Ugly " is inventively directed , challengingly structured ( it doesn't follow any straight chronological line ; it continuously mixes the present with the recent past , and then the recent past with the dim past ) , disturbing and has at least one incredibly suspenseful scene ( the one where the killer is hiding in the bathroom ) . But it is also more pretentious than it has to be , with some serious slip-ups along the way ( it has at least five " false scares " too many , and even a " double false scare " ) , and offers no new insights into the mind of a serial killer ( abusive mother , bullies in the school , he hears voices , etc . ) . Scott Reynolds is undoubtedly a talented director and I would be interested in seeing more from him , but hopefully in his other films he has put the direction more in the service of the story . ( )
486735	386241	56869	9.0	A near-masterpiece from Hitchcock .	Suggesting that " The Birds " is far superior to " Psycho " seems to be considered something of a crime by most Hitchcock fans , but I have to commit that " crime " . I believe it's superior because it holds up better after repeated viewings . " Psycho " loses much of its impact if you're familiar with the final twist ; in " The Birds " only the shock elements lose some of their power , but that gives you more time to appreciate Hitchcock's complete mastery of his film techniques . His direction is masterful , his pacing is methodical and there are several astonishing , ingenious sequences ( the scene where the birds are gathering up behind Hedren is probably one of the greatest in his career ) . Taylor and Hedren have a warm , believable chemistry as a pair . The job that has been done in the editing and sound-effects department is superb . And the ending has a wonderful apocalyptic quality . This is first-rate filmmaking . Many have tried to attach psychological or metaphysical " meanings " to the picture ; I find it more enjoyable and rewarding on simpler , less complicated levels . It doesn't have much substance ; it's just a flawless horror film and a winning love story , with some nice humorous moments .
