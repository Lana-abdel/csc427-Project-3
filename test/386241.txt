487556	386241	125967	1.0	Bad beyond your wildest imagination	" The Only Way To Spy " is not a movie . It is a random collection of images shown out of order . To say that it doesn't make sense would be an understatement ; any given scene has no connection to the previous or to the next one . There isn't a shred of talent or professionalism to be found in any frame of this picture . I'm surprised that not only it exists , but it also got a video release with a colorful video box cover that makes it look 100 times better than it actually is . It's supposed to be a soft-core action spy comedy : there is no spying , no comedy , very little - and badly filmed - action , and , infrequently , some naked breasts . The busty actress who plays " OO6 " is game enough , and with a different cast and crew around her , she could have been the lead in a genuinely sexy spy spoof . My first " 0 stars " rating in 2007 !
485816	386241	74080	2.0	Artless junk .	This film was ineptly directed , badly acted and poorly written . It was artless junk , populated exclusively by moronic and unpleasant characters . But the most depressing thought that crossed my mind while I was watching this film is that , unfortunately , grade-Z exploitationers like this often develop a cult reputation , just because they are so bad and sleazy and amateurish . Any smart viewer will know better , of course .
486977	386241	100581	2.0	Proceed at your own risk .	As a director , Dario Argento may very well be a master of the horror genre . But as a screenwriter , he has already proved that , more often than not , he doesn't have a clue . The script he has co-written for " The Sect " is so awful that I am inclined to believe there wasn't any script to begin with - they were probably making it up as they went along . The movie is simply a series of disconnected scenes that were thrown together in the vain hope that they would form some sort of " plot " . The result is a torturous piece of schlock that bored me to tears . This one should get stars , but I'll change it to 0 . 5 for the cool " face ripping " scene , and for the fun of seeing an aging Giovani Lombardo Radice in a minor role , ten years after " Cannibal Ferox " . Still , it apparently has its fans so you may want to check it out for yourself . . . .
486892	386241	178917	2.0	Atrocious	Frank is a tough LA cop ( what else in new ? ) who's had it up to here with the red tape that's been making his life difficult ( what else is new ? ) , so he recruits three female prisoners ( an ex-cop , an ex-marine and a gang member ) and trains them to combat crime in his own unorthodox way . The premise may be completely unbelievable , but it's also the only reason one could possibly have for watching " Street Angels " in the first place , as it involves three fairly hot girls kicking a . Other than that , this " film " is very bad . There is virtually no budget on display , and the fight choreography is painfully bad . There are also constant attempts at wit , and most of them are just annoying ( the main villain just won't shut his damn mouth ! ) , but occasionally they do hit a good one ( my favorite : " You'll name our team Street Angels ? That sounds like a bad no-budget action movie " ! ) .
486709	386241	79115	2.0	Sloppy and unpleasant	" Escape from Hell " is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation . The direction and writing are both sloppy : for example , the camera-work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening ; also , if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden , the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the " fake plague " plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it . I would have given this film a ( the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body ) , but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points . Of course some sickos will take that as a recommendation . After all , one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews !
485756	386241	244098	2.0	Don't bother .	This worthless , bottom-of-the-barrel , stupid slasher film is only for those who have A LOT of free time on their hands , and simply want to see a few gory killings , without any concern for quality . If you don't belong in this category , however , skip it and go watch any of the roughly 3 , 784 better horror films available in the video stores . ( )
486277	386241	179123	2.0	Utter disappointment	The cover seems to promise a female version of James Bond , but the truth is quite different . " Pepper " ( as my version was titled ) is too lame to be taken seriously as a spy thriller ( just one example : the room in which there is a device that can trigger a satellite to destroy Washington , London , Paris and Moscow is guarded by only one man ! ) , but at the same time it's not funny enough to work as a parody of the genre . There are also some drawn-out sex scenes thrown in for good measure , but since there is no connection between the characters , these don't work either . The heroine is fairly attractive but disappointingly passive , and doesn't seem to have any particular skills . Jane Bond she is not . Avoid this movie . 0 . stars .
487313	386241	101676	2.0	Incredibly bad	The only reason I'm writing this is to issue a warning , because I see that nobody else has bothered to ( and deservedly so ) : if you're thinking of renting / watching this movie because the title sounds intriguing and you feel this could be a buried exploitation treasure , PLEASE DON'T DO IT ! This must be one of the worst non-movies of its decade . Comedic sequences that are not the least bit funny , a mystery plot that can support about 10 minutes of action , and one of the most annoying leading men ever to appear on the screen ( he didn't appear again ) . Maura Tierney is kind of likable , on the other hand , and she has all my sympathy for being stuck in a role that requires from her to find her co-star . . . attractive . Please , don't be fooled , don't ever rent this .
486482	386241	94899	2.0	Enervated	OK , this is confusing . In 1984 , the Italian director Anthony Dawson ( AKA Antonio Margheriti ) made " Codename : Wildgeese " , an action film about a commando squad that goes to Southeast Asia to attack a drug lord's stronghold . It starred Lewis Collins , Lee Van Cleef , Klaus Kinski and Ernest Borgnine . In 1988 , he made " The Commander " , an action film about a commando squad that goes to Southeast Asia to attack a drug lord's stronghold . It starred Collins and Van Cleef again , but no Kinski and Borgnine this time ; in their place , there was Donald Pleasence . To further confuse matters , the version of " The Commander " I saw was actually titled " Commando : Wildgeese " ! It took me about 10 minutes to realize that I wasn't watching the 1984 film ! Anyway , all you need to remember is that " The Commander " / " Commando : Wildgeese " is a low-grade action film , to be avoided at all costs . A low point in the careers of Van Cleef and Pleasence ; all the others involved never had much of a career to begin with . The only character who piqued my interest was a beautiful female fighter , but she didn't get to do much . ( )
487450	386241	93276	2.0	The strangest . . . and the worst .	" Iron Warrior " introduces a new style both for Ator ( he has black hair now , in a ponytail , and barely utters more than fifty words in the entire movie ) and for the series itself . Director Brescia drops the silliness and campiness of the two D'Amato-directed " Ator " flicks in favor of a pseudo-arty approach . He employs every trick in the book : slow-motion , fast-motion ( ! ) , wide-angle lenses , cheap editing tricks to make people " disappear " , etc . But the result in nothing more than a ponderous , often incomprehensible film that you may have to struggle to get through . The Malta locations are admittedly very beautiful , though . ( )
485666	386241	96251	3.0	Think " Japanese MTV with a dose of violence " and you're getting close .	Unendurable , incomprehensible assault on the senses . Not really shocking or disturbing , because most of the time you don't even know what exactly you're looking at . Actually , this must be one of the worst films I've ever seen , but it has enough amazing ( for what they cost ) effects and bizarre images to warrant a viewing . But you'd better be prepared . . . ( )
486710	386241	144233	3.0	Fails on all levels	" Horror of Hell Mountain " wants to be : A ) A soft-core sex filmB ) A women-in-prison filmC ) An action film D ) A post-apocalyptic film It fails on all levels , because : A ) The tone is too depressing - there is one tasteful love scene at the very beginning , the rest is a total turn-off B ) Only two of the prisoners seem to matter as characters - all the rest are treated as pieces of meat - and even one of them is ignored at the end ! C ) It's cheap - check out the fake computer explosions at the end D ) It's shot in the Czech Republic , and that's it - there is no other effort to create a post-apocalyptic world . Even seeing Sarah Douglas doesn't help much - partly because she's beginning to look her age here and partly because it's sad to witness her huge fall from " Superman II " to a film like this . ( )
485671	386241	86972	3.0	" The keeper of knowledge - Ator the avenger ! "	Okay , the dialogue is unnecessarily portentous ( " I see . You want to test my powers of deduction " or " Mercy is not a virtue of the wicked " ) , the acting is bad ( especially by O'Keeffe and the guy who plays Zor ) , the special effects are embarrassing , the script is full of digressions instead of sticking to whatever story it has to tell . . . . . BUT this still a quite harmless film , and not the worst of its type ; out of those I've seen , " Hercules II " with Lou Ferrigno still holds that title . ( )
485737	386241	94607	3.0	A thriller that doesn't thrill . . . . . .	. . . . and that's just about the worst think that a thriller can be accused of . Unfortunately , this movie is " guilty " : it fails to involve the viewer and it lacks conviction ; the story was very uninteresting and there were very few occasions on which the filmmakers were able to convince me that something important was happening onscreen . It's a rather lethargic picture , despite some ( awkward ) occasional fast-cutting . The actors aren't bad , but you just don't care about the story or the characters . . . .
487441	386241	157262	3.0	You've been warned .	If you're a Leslie Nielsen fan , and you desperately want to see this movie , don't . It's a disastrous , too-frantic , headache-inducing , long , sloppily directed , senselessly written comedy . Read the comments on this page instead ; they are funnier ! I'll give it one star ( instead of none ) out of four though , simply for the rather elaborate production design . It's a shame that the people who worked on it saw their efforts wasted so badly .
486242	386241	82910	3.0	Padded but bearable .	This movie looks unpromising even before you see it : it's a sequel to a ripoff ! The first " Piranha " was nothing more than a low-rent imitation of " Jaws " , yet it was occasionally amusing and extremely bloody . This sequel contains almost equal amounts of blood , but it fails in every other department . It has a ludicrous concept ( flying piranhas ) that's a miracle it ever got filmed . It's full of tedious and murky underwater sequences ( not more tedious and murky than those in the Bond films , though ) and the running time is padded up by pointless scenes of uninteresting people wandering around and doing nothing that's worth watching . Not exactly unbearable , but still a poor film .
485661	386241	90859	3.0	Not funny , just repugnant .	Stallone plays a Harry Callahan clone in this absolutely repugnant actioner and gives one of his worst , most one-note performances . Most of his lines are taken directly from " Dirty Harry " , but this is more fascist .
485919	386241	75382	3.0	" A Sunday in the Country " ? Take a walk in the park instead .	Words fail to adequately describe how truly boring and depressing this film is . Basically we have to sit there for 90 minutes , waiting to see whether a complete ahole will blow two other complete aholes away or not . Oh , the thrill of it all ! The performances are awful ( Borgnine sleepwalks through his part , while Pollard looks as if he was stoned throughout the shooting ) , and the editing is catastrophic . An exercise in boredom that you should avoid . ( )
487185	386241	105881	3.0	Dreadful	Martian supercop chases Martian supervillain to Earth , and Yukari Oshima's special forces unit has to deal with them - and with warring criminal gangs on the side . " Ultracop 2000 " epitomizes nearly everything that can be bad about Hong Kong cinema - sloppy direction , incoherent script , lowbrow humor , obvious and silly wirework , jerky editing , etc . - while offering very little of the good - a few nice explosions and stunts that barely earn this film out of 4 stars . A word of advice : if you know someone who has never seen a HK film before , please don't let " Ultracop 2000 " be his / her first one or he / she may never want to see another one again ! A sad waste of Yukari Oshima , who deserves better than this .
487429	386241	226919	3.0	Every bit as bad as " Crocodile " .	" It's not like that big mechanical toy " , says a character early on , commenting on " Jaws " . Well , " Blood Surf " would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the " Jaws " series . In other words , the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE . Acting and directing are not much better , either ; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie . The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre , but for the audience too . Saying you " liked " this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap , further destroying the poor horror genre . ( )
487427	386241	130192	4.0	Sluggish thriller .	Albert Pyun's directing seems to be improving with age . This is a perfectly respectable thriller , a movie that you would hesitate to call " inept " in any way - unless of course you're a personal enemy of Pyun's . However , it's also a bit too long and sluggish , and not as exciting as it should be . It jumps to life only occasionally ( mainly in the chase scenes ) . Charlie Sheen is not very convincing as a boozing , worn-out , depressed yet brilliant writer / ex-detective ; he's both too young and too clean-cut for such a role . ( )
486659	386241	70578	4.0	Disappointing thriller .	The ambitious script deserves some credit for the way it keeps intercutting the past with the present tense , a technique that results in some intriguing effects ; in one scene we see somebody killed , in the next scene there he is , moving and talking ! But , the pace of the film is plodding , the performances detached and completely unengaging ( or maybe the characters are detached and completely unengaging ; in any case , you don't sympathize with them ) , the direction too " arty " ( for example , a driving scene with no dialogue runs about five minutes , while one of Karen Black's " melancholy " songs plays on the soundtrack ) . Plus , the VHS print I saw was SEVERELY damaged . ( )
485762	386241	78259	4.0	A curio . . . and a DUD .	I can't believe that some people actually made sense out of this incomprehensible picture . I just watched it for the second time and I didn't understand a thing . The whole movie is so nonsensical and murky that I wonder if the FILMMAKERS understood a thing . Because I suspect they didn't , and that's what the " artsy " direction tried to cover up . Weird enough to be a curio ( and many will be curious about the Shouting scene ) , " The Shout " is nevertheless a murky DUD .
486935	386241	83960	4.0	Utterly predictable .	Before you start viewing an early Chuck Norris flick , you certainly don't have particularly high expectations ; you just want to kill two hours painlessly . " Forced Vengeance " is an utterly predictable , formulaic , often boring action film , yet it generally accomplishes its mission . Norris is as stiff as ever , of course , and there are plenty of hokey fight sequences , often filmed in slow-motion , although I can't quite understand the necessity of that " gimmick " .
487143	386241	70297	4.0	Who dreamt this up ?	Maybe it's partly because I saw it late at night , but this film plays like someone's feverous bad dream . Peter Cushing is the only actor who lends a degree of seriousness and dignity in what is essentially incoherent ( even in its original , 89-minute form ) , loopy garbage . And where exactly had the vampires and the zombies been training in martial arts and swashbuckling ? Is there a " Special Karate School For The Undead " ? ? ( )
485907	386241	83803	4.0	These " Games " are no fun . . .	I somehow thought this movie would turn out to be an undiscovered treasure , but no such luck ! Visually murky and poorly plotted , this is basically an oh-so-familiar retread of " Halloween " , though the director shows some talent and tries to surpass the limitations of the script . The lousy ending does not help . ( )
485884	386241	206334	4.0	If this is the new generation of Hong Kong action cinema , I'll stick with the old one . . .	. . . and here's why : 1 ) The plot is an overlong , unengaging mess2 ) The action scenes are generic ( mostly shootouts in which it's often hard to tell who's shooting at whom , and special effects-enhanced explosions ) . 3 ) The fight scenes are brief and overedited . There is one girl ( Grace Yip ) that appears to be a better fighter than the three male leads , and where is she during the climactic fight ? Nowhere to be seen ! 4 ) 15 years after the " Lucky Stars " series , Eric Tsang is still providing the same kind of lame-brained " comic relief " . Isn't it time for this guy to give it a rest ? Two spectacular sky-diving sequences are all I'll remember from this one . . . and yes , it's easy to see why the very handsome Nicholas Tse has so many female fans . out of 4 .
487472	386241	78806	4.0	A bore .	Slow , odd film that drags and plods ( I mean really PLODS ) along to its disappointing climax . You may expect some sort of punchline at the end , but there is none . Both Milland and Snodgress give awkward performances ; in fact , the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it . The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts ( like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey ) , and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving . . . . a gorilla . ( )
485942	386241	91752	4.0	Goes from embarrassingly awful to enjoyably awful . . . .	. . . . and that happens at around the 50-minute mark , when Sybil ( as a character in the film exclaims , " WOW ! " ) Danning appears , well-cast as a fighting alien queen . Up until then " The Phantom Empire " is a plodding , sleep-inducing trek , and the cannibals with Halloween masks over their faces and old rags for clothes are beneath Z-grade cinema . The sole bright spot is Michelle Bauer as a bikini-clad " cave bunny " . After Danning's entrance , the viewer can at least focus on her phenomenal figure , and it's easier to forgive the unimpressive stop-motion animation effects ( I think " One Million Years B . C . " , from 1965 , has a better dinosaur battle than the one featured here ) . But if you want to see something from Fred Olen Ray that looks more like a real film and less like a college project , seek out his " Cyclone " from the following year . ( ) P . S . : To claim that you watched this film " for the dinosaurs " is like claiming that you watched " Jurassic Park " for the T & A .
486150	386241	113199	4.0	Boring	Gordy is a pretty cute little pig ( that also talks , not too convincingly ) , I'll grant you that , but " he " is plugged into an uninvolving , cheerless , funless , far-fetched plot . Frankly , it's hard to believe that a pig's life could be so boring . The film too often seems like an excuse for some professional country singers to appear onstage and do their stuff ; are there kids who are supposed to find those scenes entertaining ? ( )
485781	386241	427528	4.0	Slick garbage	" Mercenary for Justice " is garbage . Sure , it looks slick , with above-average ( by DTV standards ) production values , international locations , and some great stunts . But don't let the looks fool you . The story makes no sense whatsoever from beginning to end , and Seagal's ego-feeding is in full-force here ( he is introduced as " the most decorated soldier in Gulf War I " - apparently he wouldn't even settle for " second most decorated " - and , of course , nobody can land a single tiny hit on him in a fight , despite the fact that these days he has to send his stunt double to climb over a 10-foot wall ) . The viewer has no idea what is going on or why , and in a turn of events that shows just how utterly moronic this script is , Seagal and his female partner Jacqueline Lord kill several perfectly innocent Cape Town cops and security people who were just trying to protect the bank that these two were ( inexplicably ) robbing , yet the film apparently expects us to continue regarding them as the good guys ( ! ! ! ) , because they are trying to save a black kid and his mother . What the hell ? Oh , and why does that kick-ass muscular and deadly female mercenary we see in the opening sequence get killed off so quickly ? At least SHE could climb over a wall . ( )
487365	386241	113965	4.0	Preposterous and by-the-numbers .	This derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way , mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out , and because the director , Peter Hall , manages to stage a pretty hot ( and quite bold ) sex scene . But the finale , though unexpected , is preposterous , and the whole plotting ( complete with childhood traumas and multiple-personality disorders ) reveals itself to be unbearably cliched , especially as far as motivation is concerned . ( )
486925	386241	48937	4.0	Tedious	I think Rossen tried simultaneously to condense Alexander's adventurous life into a two-hour movie AND to present a revisionist and thoughtful take on the character of that famous historical figure . . . but it didn't quite work . Narrative omissions aside ( where is the middle of the three major battles that Alexander fought against the Persians ? ) , it is a tedious epic with unimpressive battle scenes and , yes , too much talk . Burton is badly miscast as Alexander ; he looks too old , especially in the early scenes when he's supposed to be a teenager ( ! ) , and lacks the proper athleticism . This would earn two stars for the production values alone , but read a book on the subject instead .
485906	386241	95063	4.0	Infuriatingly muddled .	" Dream Demon " features some imaginative visuals and clever camera shots , but is doomed by its terribly confusing , almost indecipherable plot . When it's all over , few answers have been given to the viewer and the rules of the dream-vs-reality game are never explained . This picture remains a blurry enigma from beginning to end . ( )
486272	386241	377100	4.0	Not good , but not terrible	An uninspiring , but not quite terrible , Steven Seagal vehicle . The dreary , unpleasant subject matter ( selling underage girls for prostitution ; not exactly the recipe for a fun action film , is it ? ) , and the standard Seagal ego-stroking ( he can defeat 10 men in a fight in a matter of seconds , he can remove a bullet and cauterize the wound in a few more , he is a computer ace , but he also risks his life to protect an orphaned Polish girl AND he wanders in the woods looking for injured animals so he can take them to his self-made cabin and nurse them back to health ) hold this movie back , but at least Seagal still demonstrates a few of his quick and efficient Aikido moves ( he can't roll on the floor though . . . . that has to be done by a double ! ) . Also , after seeing Agnieszka Wagner here and Tamara Davies in " Black Dawn " , I'm starting to think he has a knack for picking female partners who are both very pretty AND very capable in the action sequences . Avoid the rap stars and keep these women comin ' , Steve - they give me a reason to keep checking out some of your movies ! ( )
487057	386241	117226	4.0	Tired and tiresome mystery flick .	" An Occasional Hell " is a low point in Tom Berenger's career . His acting in this picture is so lifeless that when people refuse to tell him what they know about the case he's investigating , he looks as if he's about to say " Fine , what do I care anyway ? " . The script is so slow-moving that at times it doesn't seem to be moving at all , and the direction is so pedestrian that , without the brief flashes of nudity , this could easily pass off as a TV movie . Apparently everyone associated with this movie was just too tired to even try making something good out of it . Everyone , that is , except Kari Wuhrer , who is incredibly sexy as always , and gives the film its only spark ; sadly , her role is all-too-brief . ( )
487116	386241	86264	4.0	Lowbrow but inoffensive .	A raucous , stupid teen sex comedy that's rather bearable , if you start watching it knowing more or less what to expect . Short on laughs and genuine eroticism , to be sure , but voyeurs may still be pleased , since there's a load of nudity . Nevertheless , it's a generally inoffensive picture . ( )
486408	386241	94889	4.0	Extremely superficial .	" Cocktail " is a slick , thoroughly empty comedy-drama in the corny-junky tradition of " Dirty Dancing " . The people are all beautiful , the locations gorgeous , and the soundtrack is packed with MTV-style songs . Dramatically , it's just a collection of old cliches and LAUGHABLY old stereotypes ( Shue's typically stupid and stubborn father is very funny ) . The leads are certainly attractive , and Brown is so obviously superior to the rest of the picture that he somewhow never seems to fit in . Overall , an OK diversion , but only if you're prepared for how cliched and superficial it is .
486734	386241	95626	5.0	An OK change-of-pace for Bronson .	Bronson is rather miscast as a reporter ( who still can punch and defeat any opponent ) , but this is one of his least typical and most solid vehicles from the 80's . It begins with a weird , effectively staged massacre and includes some offbeat elements along with the familiar ones . It's still nothing special , though . It's one of those curiously forgettable films that keep you interested while you're watching them , but leave no lasting impression .
485841	386241	104998	5.0	Works best as a celebration of Tweed's body .	Shannon Tweed , who is of course incomparably better that Tanya Roberts ( the star of the first " Night Eyes " ) in every possible way , spices up this erotic thriller that is a sequel only in the sense that Andrew Stevens plays the same character . Tweed has some really steamy workout scenes , and her sex scenes are very well-photographed , but eventually get a little boring through overlength . The plot is minimal , though the film tries to " pump up " the thriller aspect in the last 20 minutes , by including some unexpectedly brutal and raw violence . ( )
485740	386241	69995	5.0	More yawns than chills .	This movie is wildly overrated . I think that most of the viewers who call it " wonderful " or " unforgettable " actually recollect only some isolated effective sequences . But if you sit down and watch the whole thing from beginning to end , then it probably won't live up to its reputation ; repeated viewings will only reveal even more weaknesses . As a psychological study , the film doesn't succeed ; the characters are cold and lack depth . As a " horror " film , it doesn't succeed , either ; it's almost never horrifying . And as a " supernatural " thriller , it's hampered by a poor script - there are too few " weird " events , considering that the movie depends almost exclusively on them . I'll be the first person to admit that the climax is stunning and chilling , even in the third viewing . But if you know how the story will turn out , there is another problem : the exceedingly slow , SLEEP-INDUCING pacing . As for the unexplained details , they don't frustrate me so much ; I don't think director Roeg knows more about the meaning of this story than we do . As for the legendary love scene , yes , it IS bold and erotic and " natural " . But it's also as redundant and unnecessary as any sex scene in the cheapest " Friday The 13Th " sequel or in the most pretentious " art " film . And stop searching for symbolic meanings related to the color red . Although it IS present in the film's two most important scenes , it is absent most of the time . If there is a color that makes a strong visual impression here , that's the color gray , without a doubt .
486996	386241	118025	5.0	Something is missing here . . . .	Now here's a movie that's hard to know how to react to . It's more interesting as a drama ; there are surprising complexities in Larry Cohen's script , and unexpected poignancy in some of the scenes with Isaac Hayes as a disillusioned war veteran . But as a horror film it's kind of half-hearted , and most of the blame for this failure must go to director Lustig , who has made several cult films over the years , but it's doubtful whether he has made one that can be called , without reservations , " good " . ( )
486979	386241	160184	5.0	" Eye See You " is a ludicrous title for a movie , so . . . .	. . . I'll call it " D-Tox " instead . Under any name , this is not as bad as the " no theatrical release " label indicates , but with this cast and this setting , it should have been much better . The whole production has a rushed , sloppy feel to it ; the characters are poorly defined ( Tom Berenger and Robert Prosky are especially wasted , while other actors barely even get to utter two or three lines - only Robert Patrick comes through with a strong characterization ) and the script is choppy - you never even get a clear idea of how the rehab center operates . And while the killer does serve his purpose ( i . e . , the audience wants him to die in as gruesome a way as possible ) , the revelation of his identity is pretty ho-hum - the filmmakers haven't bothered giving him any real motivation , so he could be just about anyone . Nonetheless , the director does manage to pull off some impressive shots , and Sylvester Stallone tries his hand at a more dramatic role than usual , with moderate success . ( )
486178	386241	87412	5.0	New genre : pseudo-philosophical soft-core	Personally I hated the original " Story of O " with a passion , and I only saw this in-name-only " sequel " by accident . Thankfully , the treatment of the subjects is a little more tasteful this time . Not that there aren't some unpleasant scenes here , but at least some of the women ( especially " O " ) are allowed to have a more balanced , sometimes even dominant role . And when the film seems to go into inexcusable territory near the end , it pulls the rug out from under your feet . It's a strange , interesting but confused and largely pointless film . Why pointless ? Because most people looking for an examination of money , power , sex and politics will choose to watch something else , and those looking for a 100 % erotic film won't be very satisfied either . ( )
486081	386241	74437	5.0	Better than its reputation suggests .	After reading all the reviews about this film , I was expecting either a sleaze-fest or a camp-fest ( or both ) , but I was pleasantly ( ? ) surprised . Although there are undeniably exploitational elements here ( incest , castrations , torture ) , the director doesn't really linger over them . Nobody would mistake this for a thoughtful study on the mistreatment of black slaves in early 19th-century America , but it's a surprisingly well-made film , and the recreation of the period is just fine . The major weakness of " Drum " is that the male lead , Ken Norton , simply can't act ; thankfully , Warren Oates and Yaphet Kotto certainly can . Pam Grier is wasted , however , and Colicos is positively ludicrous as a gay slave-trader . ( )
485688	386241	60437	5.0	Flabby spy yarn .	" The Ipcress File " was a genuinely intriguing spy thriller , a refreshing viewing choice for the mature viewers that were tired of the typical Bond films . Unfortunately , this sequel doesn't turn out to be a worthy one . Caine is still superb as Harry Palmer , of course , and he still has his dry cynicism ( when a woman likes him , he suspects that she's hiding something since he knows that he isn't that irresistible ) , but there are major problems with the pacing and the plot . This film is slow and flabby , and the story - after a relatively easy-to-follow first hour - becomes awfully confusing , a mistake that the original never made . " Funeral In Berlin " is still much better than the terrible third Harry Palmer film ( " Billion Dollar Brain " ) , and it has a memorable music theme , but take my advice : watch only " The Ipcress File " and skip the other two parts of the trilogy .
487376	386241	117760	5.0	An uneven mix of drama , comedy and violence	Shu Qi - the face of a goddess , with the body to match ! She arguably steals the show even from the cute and feisty as usual Chingmy Yau , and that is no small accomplishment . The first hour of this movie deals mostly with the rivalry between two night clubs operating in the same Hong Kong area - not exactly the stuff that compelling drama is made of . Then Simon Yam re-appears ( he had left the picture after the first 5 minutes ) , and his forceful performance makes the film more involving - he plays a scumbag that you really want to see knocked down . Fans of either of the three stars won't be disappointed , and fans of " Category III " Hong Kong sleaze may " enjoy " ( if that's the word ) the final half-hour , but pure action fans need not bother with this film . It's basically a drama , sprinkled with broad , raunchy comedy and nasty , unpleasant violence . ( )
486381	386241	91990	5.0	Derivative , but not the worst of its type .	Mad killer escapes from an insane asylum and goes after his sister ( does this remind you of anything ? ) , with whom he shares an unexplained telepathic link . This film is not too bad of its type , but it's just too derivative of both " Halloween " and " Nightmare on Elm Street " ( there are many ominous dream sequences ) . The main heroine is fairly engaging , but the rest of the characters are almost indistinguishable from one another ( and the men are badly acted , too ) . ( )
487498	386241	82611	5.0	Silly fun .	If one was to try and make a list of all the implausibilities and flaws in this movie , he would need much more than a thousand words . From its crummy-looking cinematography ( the sky looks mostly yellow ) to its supremely silly plot ( that is just an excuse to get from one kung-fu scene to another in as little time as possible ) , this flick is bad . But . . . it's enjoyably bad . It is intended for bad-movie lovers ONLY , and only if you belong in that category should you take my rating seriously .
486821	386241	67162	5.0	Far below expectations , but has its strengths .	A disappointing adaptation of a James Chase novel ( which I have read , incidentally ) . It's a cheap , mostly badly cast production , with an incredibly choppy beginning , and full of poorly-drawn characters that don't make much of an impression on the viewer . The one important exception is the character of Slim Grissom ; neurotic , explosively unpredictable and complicated , this guy functions like a human-size time-bomb . Scott Wilson's convincing , excellent performance in the role elevates this movie , which , however , still should have been much better . ( )
486651	386241	79351	5.0	Below-par Hill & Spencer entry .	The Hill & Spencer movies were never famous for their brilliant stories , but this one doesn't even make an effort . Plotless , slow-paced , boring and only occasionally amusing , it feels like a film that was made out of obligation , rather than like something that the stars and the filmmakers put their hearts in . At least with its animal-friendly messages you could say it's good for kids , but no - they'll be as bored with it as anyone else . ( )
486755	386241	106418	5.0	Languid erotic thriller with spurts of violence	The first half of this " country thriller " ( if I may invent a term ) is slow and languid , with an atmosphere of eroticism and barely any plot progression . In the second half the pace picks up a little , but there are too many plot contrivances . Stephen Baldwin gives a pretty bad performance here - I don't know if the popularity of the same year's " Forrest Gump " influenced his acting style , but he often makes his character look like a retard . On the other hand , Patsy Kensit and Jennifer Rubin are well-cast ; Kensit probably has the edge in sexiness thanks to her British accent ! Fans of either of the three main actors will probably enjoy this ; if you're not , you might want to keep your distance . ( )
486963	386241	75147	5.0	A spiritless film .	Spiritless , disappointing film that makes you feel as tired as its middle-aged " heroes " . You never really know how you are supposed to feel while you're watching awkward scenes like Robin Hood's last swordfight , and you sense that the filmmakers don't know why they included those awkward scenes , either . Connery and Hepburn are very good individually , but they don't click as a pair .
486991	386241	117420	5.0	Keeps us waiting too long .	Van Damme and Roger Moore together ? Talk about an unlikely and mismatched team ! Roger actually looks bored most of the time , which is very uncharacteristic of him . Van Damme made his directorial debut here and I think he did an OK job in that department , but it's the script that dooms this film . We have to wait an ungodly amount of time for the real action to begin , and while in the last 20 minutes there's plenty of it ( and it's dynamically staged ) , it follows the same pattern that we have learned from so many other Van Damme movies : first he gets beaten to a pulp , then he makes a miraculous comeback , etc . ) ( )
486200	386241	113926	5.0	Naked Pamela	Taken as a sci-fi thriller , " Naked Souls " lies somewhere between " mediocre " and " not bad " . The ideas ( mind-switching , memory transfer , etc ) are intriguing , even if they have been used in many other films ( the French thriller " La Machine " , with Depardieu , is one that comes to mind ) , but this film goes nowhere with them . However , Pamela Anderson looks breathtakingly gorgeous here ( I don't remember ever seeing her look better ) , and she has one particularly sensual sex scene ( damn was her partner a lucky guy ! ) . The filmmakers must have liked that scene too , because they repeat it in the last few minutes . . . . and it's actually better the second time because it's not intercut ( like it is the first time ) with David Warner's reactions . No disrespect to Warner , who is a fine actor , but he kind of kills the mood in this instance , if you know what I mean . . . . ( )
486404	386241	55841	5.0	Glossy trash .	Vapid , profoundly trashy film , somewhat redeemed by fair performances and glossy production values . Jane Fonda's acting , however , is indeed surprisingly weak ; it's hard to believe that the same actress gave such a powerful and moving performance in " The Chase " , only four years later . The film is both sleazy and tame ; it deals exclusively with the subject of sex , but it is very un-sexy , and never says anything meaningful , either . At least it's painless to watch .
486013	386241	403657	5.0	Forgive and forget	In chronological order : 1 ) The Dudley Boyz vs . La Resistance and Rob Conway . So lame that even the commentators couldn't keep their attention on it . ) Test vs . Scott Steiner . The winner gets Stacy ( MY GOODNESS she's perfection ) Keibler . If they had Stacy simply standing in the middle of the ring , this would have been a lot more interesting . 3 ) Shawn Michaels vs . Randy Orton ( with Ric Flair ) . A slight improvement over the previous two . A lot of cheating determines the winner in this one . 4 ) Gail Kim and Molly Holly vs . Trish Stratus and Lita . That's more like it ! Faster , better and more energetic than anything before it , with some great moves by Trish . 5 ) Shane McMahon vs . Kane . A " last man standing " match with no disqualifications . Brutal , but slower than molasses . 6 ) Christian vs . Chris Jericho vs . Rob Van Dam . Pretty good . RVD seems to be the best wrestler of the three , so most of the time the other two team up to get him out of the way . Some impressive kicks by RVD , and a painful hold by Jericho . An entertaining show . 7 ) Jerry " The King " Lawler and Jim Ross ( the commentators of this whole PPV ! ) vs . Al Snow and Jonathan Coachman . The winners will be the commentators on " Raw " . Whoever thought this was a good idea for a tag-team match should be shot . 8 ) Triple H vs . Goldberg for the WH title . Fair , with some displays of raw power , but not much more than that .
485840	386241	94961	5.0	Wild horror comedy .	This outrageous comic-book style film crosses two genres : the buddy comedy with the zombie horror film . You'll get some undemanding fun from it , but there should be more . It has a fast pace and some good special effects ( the disintegration of a woman , etc ) , but too many repetitive puns about the dead cop's condition ( OK . We get it . He's a walking corpse . Anything else ? ) ( )
485641	386241	93220	5.0	Low-rent sequel to a low-rent movie .	This pseudo-sequel to " House " has no relation whatsoever to it , but the two films do share some common qualities : they are both low-rent , the " jungle " scenes here are as totally unconvincing as the Vietnam flashbacks there , and the comic moments work much better than the supposed " horror " ones .
487030	386241	118636	6.0	Interesting , but falls short of greatness .	" Apt Pupil " is an undeniably interesting psychological drama . Bryan Singer's directing doesn't reach the levels of brilliance of " The Usual Suspects " , but it's careful and technically flawless . His material presents some serious problems , though : the movie's moral message is ambivalent at best , and at the end we are pretty much asked to admire the young hero for using his " mentor's " blackmailing methods so effectively . And the story DOES contain some amazing coincidences that are hard to accept ( the kid recognized a man from a 40-year-old photo ? ) . Ian McKellen's performance has been widely praised ; I thought that he was never as menacing as he was meant to be . But Renfro is excellent , and David Schwimmer seems astonishingly ideal for his role . On the whole , a gripping movie , but rather forgettable - and it goes on too long .
486645	386241	108609	6.0	" You dirty creeper ! "	The " sequel " to the cult Hong Kong hit " Naked Killer " ( which , unfortunately , I have not seen yet ) is , according to all sources , a much different film . Not the best way to get acquainted with modern Hong Kong cinema , but a fair enough ride for more seasoned fans . Meandering and unpleasant at times , with the usual uneasy Hong Kong mix of different tones , but technically well-made ; Chingmy Yau's charming presence and Simon Yam's good performance make up for a lot of other deficiencies . Warning : the DVD subtitling is OUTRAGEOUSLY bad ; not even eight-year-old kids make so many grammatical and spelling errors in each written sentence . ( )
486694	386241	108656	6.0	Chan is effective in one of his more serious roles .	Although the complete lack of comedy may disappoint some of Jackie Chan's fans , I found him quite fascinating to watch in this more serious part ; he proves , once and for all , that he CAN act , and he handles his complex relationship with the chief villain ( who is not as one-dimensional a character as you might expect ) particularly well . Perhaps if you're unaccustomed to Hong Kong action cinema , the frenetic pacing and chaotic storytelling , combined with the ( bad , of course , but not unacceptable this time ) dubbing , can create a disorienting effect . But the action starts early on and never lets up , and the fight scenes , while not numerous , are AMAZING . ( )
487157	386241	100881	6.0	Weak plot but stylish direction ( SOME SPOILERS )	One of Lucio Fulci's last films , this is a cross between a murder mystery and a horror shocker . It has a rather weak script and resolution ( it just doesn't seem to matter much who did it one way or the other ) , but it's stylishly , sometimes imaginatively directed by Fulci . ( SPOILERS FOLLOW ) . . . . . . Some viewers called this too tame ; I guess it depends on your standards . It does feature a gruesome autopsy scene , repeated shots of worms munching on a rotting corpse , a attack by decomposed zombies ( ! ) and a scene of a man who spits blood . Not your normal " mystery " stuff , I'd say . ( )
486927	386241	100637	6.0	Overloaded with wisecracks .	If you've ever wondered what a horror film written by a Woody Allen wannabe would come out like , then check this one out . It's imaginatively directed , has a typical but enjoyable " haunted place " premise , solid makeup effects . . . . it's an all-around good job , but with one major flaw : the dialogue is overloaded with cheeky wisecracks and witticisms ( sample : " You want scary ? Go shopping with my ex-wife " ) that sometimes hit the mark , but are too often delivered at the most inappropriate moments ( even while the hero is battling an evil ghost ! ) . ( )
487519	386241	92130	6.0	A mixed bag .	The movie begins badly , with some racing scenes that go on for so long you may start thinking you're watching a James Bond flick . Then it wastes some more time by following the characters in their everyday activities , which are of little interest . But when the couple from " A Man And A Woman ' is finally reunited , Lelouch shows that he still hasn't lost his touch when it comes to quiet dialogue scenes , in which expressions speak as loudly as words . And the idea of filming a movie ABOUT the story we saw in the first movie makes for an intriguing re-examination of the original from an unusual perspective - the perspective of the fictional character who starred in it . But Lelouch still can't stay concentrated on the things that really matter , and even when he later introduces a new , completely unexpected story thread ( the " adventure " in the desert ) , he keeps intercutting it with another film-within-a-film , which is boring and pointless . The final impression is that of a film with many good things in it , but also a whole lot of flaws . ( )
486447	386241	22158	6.0	Perhaps their most anarchic film . Not their best	Most Marx Brothers fans agree that their first five films , made for Paramount , were generally better than their remaining eight . Among their early films , however , " Monkey Business " is probably the one that is most rarely mentioned ( OK , maybe it is mentioned more often than " The Cocoanuts " ) . There is a reason for that : although this may be the single most anarchic Marx outing , it is not one of their best . Anarchic also means disorganized , and this has its good and its bad points : there is almost no plot to get in the way of the comedy ( good ) , but there is also a missed opportunity to go further with the idea of the Groucho-Zeppo and Harpo-Chico teams working for rival gangsters ( bad ) . There are no musical numbers involving secondary characters ( good ) , but there is a piano solo and a harp solo back-to-back in the last 15 minutes ( bad structure ) . Seeing this film today , it is Harpo's physical comedy that seems the most timeless in my opinion . Sure , Groucho could deliver his lines incredibly fast and some of those lines were decades ahead of their time , but Harpo is the life of the film's most memorable bits , like the puppet show or his impersonation of Maurice Chevalier . He is like a visitor from another planet , where people are allowed to do all the things we want to do but can't . He's extraordinary . ( )
485876	386241	83366	6.0	Childish , occasionally amusing .	It begins as a spirited , freewheeling farce , but somewhere along the line it runs out of script and goes flat ; this is the kind of comedy that will occasionally have you grinning but rarely truly laughing . George Hamilton is equally zesty and self-spoofing in both his roles , but Leibman , as Zorro's merciless enemy , gets increasingly annoying as the film goes along . ( )
486038	386241	95984	6.0	No surprises , but still a solid " B " .	Solid B-movie with OK performances and slam-bang special effects . This is one of those neglected little thrillers that set out not to offer anything new to the genre , but at least to give fans of those movies their money's worth . And this one generally seems to know its business ( although it does get a little too loud near the end ) . ( )
487370	386241	100404	6.0	Overplotted and stagy , but fairly compelling .	When I had watched this film a few years ago for the first time , my overall impression was highly negative ; I found it to be a boring , stagy courtroom thriller unworthy of its great cast . Now that I watched it again , more attentively , I STILL find Pakula's direction overly stagy , but some virtues do begin to show up . Undoubtedly , the casting is the main one : the movie is filled with terrific supporting performances , from Raul Julia as an incredibly clever counselor to Bonnie Bedelia as the frustrated wife . Harrison Ford himself is very good ( although with a bad haircut ) in one of his unconventional roles . But the movie has too many plot threads , some of which could have easily been omitted to make the whole story shorter and more tense . ( )
486760	386241	104823	6.0	Respectable low-budget martial arts film	The plot is nothing new ( police corruption , a crime syndicate that uses a night club as a front , a cop investigating the death of his partner , etc . ) but the fight scenes range from good to very good ( the best one might be an illegal 2-on-1 that doesn't involve any of the leads ) . Maybe they can't match up to the best that Hong Kong has to offer , but they are choreographed in a way that showcases the fighters ' power , speed and technique . My two main disappointments with this film are : 1 ) as already reported by another reviewer , VERY short final fight between Cynthia Rothrock and the female bodyguard ( what a bummer ! ) , and 2 ) no arch-villain role for the master of such roles , Billy Drago ( he's just a corrupted police chief ) . ( )
485804	386241	95871	6.0	Morbid , offbeat .	This film is certainly unique - nothing like you've ever seen before . That's not necessarily a good thing , but it does make it intriguing . Sure , it may remind you of " Psycho " or of " Magic " ( the 1978 thriller with Hopkins ) , but its slow pacing , its MORBID atmosphere and its weirdness make it feel completely different from those movies . It's not particularly good or bad , just EXTREMELY weird . Pay attention to the opening sequence , or else the ending will seem inconclusive and you'll have to rewind the tape - like I did .
486554	386241	102067	6.0	Continues the upward course of the series ( after the good " V " )	A werewolf movie with an unconventional angle : you actually want the werewolf to prevail in this one . It has an air of mystery and at times it's very compelling , but the climactic " battle of the beasts " is kind of silly . Still , it's miles ahead of Parts " II " , " III " and " IV " . ( )
487011	386241	156729	6.0	A disappointment .	Don McKellar tackles an unimaginably difficult and thought-provoking subject matter here - too bad this shallow , sombre and often dull film doesn't do it justice . It does have some funny and poignant moments ( as well as some that are both funny and poignant at the same time - a man says to his friend " See you later " and the other guy responds " No you won't " ) , but ultimately there are no real revelations , nothing you couldn't come up with yourself , without seeing the movie . When the highest compliment that people pay to a movie in the vast majority of the reviews here is " There are no special effects " , you know you're in trouble . ( )
487277	386241	90681	6.0	A mixed bag	" Operation Pink Squad " is a strange HK mix of action , drama and lowbrow comedy . The cover features four girls , and the Pink Squad IS made of four girls , but two of them aren't really important and are soon forgotten . The main leads are Anne Bridgewater and Sandra Ng . Anne has the lion's share of the action - the film begins with an incredible fight scene ( her vs . Jeffrey Falcon ) , but sadly she has only two more fights after that : the one has no proper ending and the other is too silly ( she is disguised as a clown ) . Sandra is in charge of the comic and dramatic elements , and she handles them well , in fact she is the main reason they work at all . Overall , the film is a mixed bag , and probably works better if you know that you should not expect a lot of action . ( )
487567	386241	90659	6.0	OK action thriller .	" Armed Response " is one of Fred Olen Ray's earliest directorial efforts , and it also less schlocky than some of his other ones , closer to an actual legitimate action film ( it's hard to believe he would make a film as unbelievably bad as " Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers " only two years later ) . It has a fairly complicated plot , which would be hard to summarize in a single paragraph , and a cast that's a B-movie fan's dream ( where else could you find Lee Van Cleef and Michael Berryman together ? ) , though it must be noted that David Carradine is particularly awful in this movie . ( )
486226	386241	63636	6.0	Twisty yarn .	Near the beginning of this film , there is a fistfight , but it's not exciting because we don't know why the two men are fighting . A little later , there is a car chase , but it's not exciting either , because we don't know who's chasing whom or why . Later still , we find out the answers to those questions , but two potentially good action scenes have been wasted . And then the movie turns into a standard heist flick . . . . thankfully only for a while . The focus here is not on the actual heist , but more on the aftermath . And it's there that the movie finally goes in unexpected directions . There is , for example , the bizarre scene in which a man gets off on shooting someone with a machine-gun . There is the memorable image of a white sheet that gradually " absorbs " the blood of the body that's underneath it , and red spots start appearing on it . And there some neat plot twists along the way , mostly involving a character ( I won't say which ) that enters the picture when you least expect him to . If the whole movie was as good as its final 30 minutes , I'd give it one more star , but for now this gets a rating .
486224	386241	70679	6.0	This one earns its " R " rating .	Perhaps the most entertaining of the three " Shaft " films , but be warned : it's incredibly violent ! ( Shaft snaps necks , elbows , runs over people with his car , you name it ) . It's also more sexually provocative than any other mainstream release of the 70s I can think of . In other words , this is the first and only " Shaft " movie that lives up to its reputation in terms of violence and nudity . Whether or not this is a recommendation is up to you to decide . ( )
486953	386241	82406	6.0	A beautifully made but predictable film .	A beautifully animated cartoon , with loving attention to detail and bright , pleasing colors . . . . but the story is overly predictable . Kids will probably like this , and adults will have a passable time , but don't expect anything in the realm of " Alladin " . . . ( )
485932	386241	82243	6.0	Hypnotic .	Not quite the underrated masterpiece other people are talking about , I'm afraid . It begins well enough , with an atmospheric , out-of-this-world Tangerine Dream score and hypnotically slow direction , but the story tips its hand too early ; the basics ( if not the particulars ) of its plot become rather obvious to us well before they do to the characters . Still , this is above average for an early-80s horror film . ( )
487166	386241	68281	6.0	Familiar but enjoyable .	Jim Brown , the personification of coolness , is the nightclub owner who decides to avenge his brother's murder and begins a war against the local Mafia . Familiar but enjoyable , thanks largely to Brown's presence , and to some dynamic action scenes . Two interesting things : the use of wide-angle lenses during a fight scene , and a strong supporting role for the actor who was memorable as one of the two homosexual goons in " Diamonds Are Forever " . ( )
486932	386241	80360	6.0	Outrageous !	Highly ambitious , pretentious horror film is packed with delirious , hallucinatory sequences that seem to try to take the viewer on an " acid trip " . Many memorable images , but the story is developed disappointingly and leads nowhere . The movie is definitely worth seeing ( at least twice ) , if only for its stunning effects , but don't expect to comprehend all the parts or to find much substance . All the actors deserve praise for their very good work here .
486809	386241	97573	6.0	Not bad .	This is a slick erotic thriller with an interesting plot , lengthy sex scenes that will appeal to both men and women , and a few amusing references to Brian De Palma and Hitchcock's " The Birds " . Although it bogs down a little in the middle , and has some atrocious dialogue , it is still one of Mastorakis ' best efforts ( out of the handful I've seen ) . And it would perhaps be even better if the two main actresses had switched roles , with Shannon Tweed being the mysterious femme fatale instead , and Adrienne Sachs getting the thankless supporting part . ( )
486331	386241	407301	6.0	Spoiler : Chris Benoit defends the title in his hometown	This is an uneven PPV . About half of the matches are worth seeing , but the other half are barely average . 1 ) Shelton Benjamin vs . Ric Flair . Visibly fake . Benjamin has to pull his punches and receive about 50 backhand slaps . I can accept Ric Flair as a ringside interference , but putting him in the center of the ring , alone , at his age , is a joke . 2 ) Jonathan Coachman vs . Tajiri . Another joke . The only way this match could be good is if Tajiri demolished " The Coach " in three minutes , but this doesn't happen . The high-kicking " Japanese Buzzsaw " deserves better booking than this . ) Chris Jericho vs . Christian and Trish Stratus . A 2-on-1 handicap match . What could have been yet another mediocre encounter between these two men is made a little more lively by the involvement of Trish ( who even gets spanked here ! ) . Then we get a small segment / tribute to Chris Benoit , at whose hometown this PPV was shot . Nice , but it removes even the last drop of suspense about the outcome of the main event . 4 ) Victoria vs . Lita ( for the women's title ) . FANTASTIC ! ! ! This is what the word " wrestling " is all about . The match lasts only 10 minutes , but you can see more technical holds and moves in these 10 minutes than in entire PPVs . Even the camera stays mostly on the ground level to follow the action . These two women work excellently together , and - in another nice touch - there is no fake " hate " between them , only respect ( at one point , they smile and congratulate each other ) . Victoria is a terrific champion - she should be wearing the belt more often . P . S . The aftermath of this match shows how badly misused Gail Kim was in the WWE . 5 ) Randy Orton vs . Mick Foley . A no-holds-barred fight for the intercontinental title , with the Evolution banned from ringside ( yes , really ! ) . I'm not a fan of hardcore matches , but I have to admit this one delivers what it promises . Some CRAZY stuff here . if you like this sort of thing , if you don't . 6 ) The Hurricane and Rosey vs . La Resistance . Hurricane and Rosey are an interesting , unorthodox team ( one looks like a cruiserweight , the other like a sumo wrestler ) , but after about 3 minutes Eugene shows up and the commentators , the crowd and even the cameraman stop paying attention to the match . I guess Eugene was supposed to turn it into a comedy , but he turns it into a tragedy instead . until he appears , then 0 . 7 ) Kane vs . Edge . Slightly better than other Kane matches , because it's relatively short and the action is mostly confined inside the ring . By the way , is there anyone who believes that someone like Edge can defeat someone like Kane in a real fight ? 8 ) Shawn Michaels vs . Triple H vs . Chris Benoit . A triple-threat match for the heavyweight title . This is a good main event . However , that's all it is - simply " good " . Benoit does his nice submission moves , HHH tries to dominate through sheer power , and HBK plays " Sweet Chin Music " ( when he's not knocked out cold outside ) . And of course when " A " ( whoever that may be ) is about to lose to " B " , " C " interferes . In the end , the right man wins and the fans go home happy . No surprises here .
486317	386241	68154	6.0	Better than the first . . . . for what that's worth .	This sequel to " They Call Me Trinity " is a slight improvement on the original ; it has a couple of chuckles here and there ( like Maltin says , the " restaurant scene " is the funniest ) and a LARGE-scale final showdown between the " good guys " ( including some monks ) and the " bad guys " , but still nothing to write home about . Hill and Spencer had obviously perfected their screen personas by that point , but it's a pity nobody sat down to write them a real script ; the story in " Trinity Is Still My Name ! " meanders and tires before long . I would like to say , however , that it may be the best-dubbed movie ever ; no awkward synchronization problems are present , and those who did the voices were obviously enjoying their work . You would SWEAR it was filmed in English ! ( )
487179	386241	85701	6.0	Too choppy , too arty , but has its moments .	This is the kind of film that you'll either admire or despise - and you'll know which category you fall into after the opening five minutes or so . Much of it is pretentiously arty and choppy , but there are some effective moments , and a literally awesome , amazing sequence : David Bowie , suffering from a rare disease that makes him age rapidly , waits for doctor Susan Sarandon , expert on such matters , to examine him ; she thinks he's a nut and ignores him ; and he gets about 30 years older within two hours . Awe-inspiring ! However , when Bowie disappears from the action , the movie goes downhill . ( )
486551	386241	80166	6.0	Yuen Biao is awesome	First things first : the fight scenes in " Knockabout " are plentiful and SUPERB . Some of them are staged like elaborate comic dances - Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton would probably be pleased if they could see some of the gags here . In addition to his great fighting , Yuen Biao performs many admirable acrobatic feats ( I doubt that Jackie Chan could ever do some of the stuff that Biao does here ) , and Sammo Hung moves with incredible agility for a man his size ! There is also a lot of comedy in this film , which will not be to everyone's taste , as it involves a lot of mugging and twitching ( as well as exaggerated sound effects and animal sounds ) , but there ARE some genuinely funny moments . The only problem with the film is the plodding pacing : there simply isn't enough story to support 100 minutes of running time . ( )
485725	386241	66053	7.0	Haunting .	A fascinating story - a man haunted by his doppelganger - and Roger Moore's excellent performance ( s ) make this film worth seeing , even though it overelaborates its point somewhat ( the situation becomes clear to us long before Moore figures it out ) . Still , what we have here is an example of how a good movie can be produced on a relatively low budget , as long as it has a strong script and dependable actors . ( )
485976	386241	210382	7.0	Underrated film by an underrated director .	" The Weight of Water " ( interestingly obscure title , isn't it ? ) is not a masterpiece , and sometimes seems to be striving for a " greater meaning " that simply isn't there . However , that's no excuse for its excessively poor critical reception . Yes , the " seduction " part of the present story is a bit cliched , and the story of the past goes pretty much where you expect it ( after a point ) to go . In spite of all that , the film is able to get by on the strength of Kathryn Bigelow's direction , which is , in a word , impeccable . Every single shot is meticulously planned and - when it has to be - visually beautiful . Bigelow has already proved that she is a master of her craft when it comes to directing high-energy action sequences ; here she proves that she is equally adept at subtlety . There are facial expressions , small gestures and glances that speak volumes in this movie . Of course part of the credit for that has to go to the cast , which is mostly superb ( with the notable exception of Elizabeth Harley ) ; Catherine McCormack and Sarah Polley are the best , each one holds her own story together perfectly . The film also has stunning photography and a beautiful music score . ( )
487338	386241	39302	7.0	Unlikely plot made entertaining by sheer star power .	This is a good example of how far sheer star power can carry a movie . The unlikely plot is riddled with coincidences that might have been unacceptable under different circumstances , but just because the leads are Bogart and Bacall , you're willing to cut it some slack . Terrific acting ( especially by Bogart , who has to act a lot with his eyes here ) , great camerawork in the first half and taut dialogue ( or maybe it's the delivery that's taut ) make " Dark Passage " an entertaining 40s thriller . ( )
485759	386241	167752	7.0	" The Tenant " meets " Rear Window " ; excellent until the last 10 minutes .	When the build-up of a movie is as good as it is in " The 4th Floor " , the third act will almost inevitably have to be somewhat disappointing . The director , who is a first-timer to boot , does a very good job of creating a sinister , eerie atmosphere and keeping us hooked , always in doubt about who the guilty party is . Then in the last 10 minutes , it all becomes a routine slasher film , complete with half-baked plot " explanations " and a gratuitous " twist ending " . Still , for the most part this an excellent little thriller , and definitely worth your time . ( )
486968	386241	70068	7.0	Surprisingly good .	" 40 Carats " is a surprisingly good movie . While Ullmann and Albert have little chemistry together , they nevertheless make a sweet pair , because they are both enormously appealing individually . Gene Kelly adds a few nice moments and leads a likable supporting cast . The film is slightly overlong but more mature than you might think .
485692	386241	60232	7.0	Highly underrated picture .	" The Chase " is a powerful and underrated drama . It has most of the ingredients that are required for a solid dramatic picture : exceptional acting ( particularly by Brando ) , careful directing , well-drawn characters and good production values . The first half meanders a little , but in the second half the tension mounts and the film becomes constantly more and more involving and moving . So why does it have such a low reputation ? Maybe because of all those reported production problems . But who cares ? They're certainly not evident in the film ! Recommended for mature viewers .
486615	386241	74860	7.0	Stunning Olivier , not-so-stunning script .	" Marathon Man " is too unpleasant to be typically entertaining , but it's still a fine piece of moviemaking , intensely suspenseful at times . Olivier's performance is stunning and will stay in the memory of any person that watches this film . But the script isn't so stunning . It's adequate for a good thriller , limited for a great one .
485791	386241	110570	7.0	Funny but flat .	Roberto Benigni is a gifted physical comedian , but his pre-Oscar " Il Mostro " is best seen with an audience ; the laughter helps cover up the dead spots . If you see it home alone , you can still get laughs out of some cleverly constructed gags , but the flatness of Benigni's direction cannot be ignored . ( )
486467	386241	235737	7.0	A true attention-getter of a film .	Excellent adult thriller . Stylish , intense , funny and unexpectedly moving . Intricately plotted ( it will always be one step ahead of you ) and fluidly , inventively directed ( including a unique twist on Eastwood's classic " Did I fire six bullets . . . or only five ? " line ) . Well-acted , especially by Kilmer . The less you know about it beforehand the better , though , so I'll just add this : this film is not always pleasant to watch , but it has personality and will take you on quite a journey . Don't read about it , see it . ( )
487290	386241	66769	7.0	You'll have to strain a bit . . .	Robert Wise's solemn approach is so unentertaining that the few humorous moments stand out as brief , merciful doses of relief . However , I must admit that the film has great set design , believable performances and a suspenseful climax - not to mention those " oh , so 70s " heavy " government - conspiracy - paranoia " overtones . ( )
485647	386241	253126	7.0	Implausible but fun .	This movie starts out unremarkable , but it gets better , so stick with it . It is alternately silly ( mostly in the first and last 15 minutes ) and edgy ( in the middle ) , but if you can ignore the various implausibilities ( why would such a well-organized and highly professional team of robbers have such a moron as their lookout in the first place ? ) it's fun , with engaging performances particularly by Minnie Driver and Kevin McNally ( who does the right thing by playing his role straight ) . In any case , it is much better than the very similar and mean-spirited " Beautiful Creatures " from the same year . ( )
487142	386241	101595	7.0	Extremely low-key .	" Close My Eyes " deserves credit for its unexploitive treatment of a highly charged subject matter . On the other hand , I found it just a bit dramatically monotonous . However , it's worth seeing for its sensitivity and its good acting . Alan Rickman , in particular , is very interesting in what could have easily been a thankless supporting part . ( )
486084	386241	95337	8.0	Hong Kong action at its absolute finest !	This is the first and only Cynthia Khan movie I have seen so far , and all I have to say is " WOW ! " . She is amazing - more flexible than rubber . If she ever got in a fight with Jackie Chan , he could conceivably beat her , but I wouldn't bet my money on it ! Plus , she is MUCH cuter than Michelle Yeoh . And if she is not enough , there is an extra bonus for action-girl fans : one of the villains is a real tough bich who definitely won't go down without a fight . But the men don't get short-changed , either : there is a Japanese cop and two male villains , and all three are VERY determined and VERY good at fighting - the cop and one of the bad guys engage in one of the most brutal , vicious fights that have ever been committed to film . The rest of the action scenes ( car crashes , explosions , shootouts ) are also supreme . The film never stops to take a breath - there is little of the comedy that usually bogs down Hong Kong productions ( there ARE cameos by some of the " Lucky Stars " , but they only last a few seconds ) . As a result , there is more room for action , action and more action . And if action is what you want , " In The Line Of Duty 3 " is as good as it gets . ( )
485886	386241	113350	8.0	Not to be missed	" Red Wolf " gets off to a rather shaky start , but once the action kicks in , it is nonstop . The fight scenes are among the best I've ever seen ; they are on the level of the rooftop climax of Jackie Chan's " Who Am I ? " , except they're not limited to one sequence , but they occur every 5 minutes or so . There is also a lot of shooting , and A LOT of shattered glass . But it's not a mindless movie ; the characters often have to use their smarts to escape from sticky situations . Kenny Ho is a great fighter , full of intensity and conviction , and he appears to be doing all of his own stunts . Elaine Lui ( who plays the BAD girl , NOT the hero's sidekick as others have said ) is absolutely dazzling , a goddess of evil . Judging this movie on its own terms , I give it out of 4 stars . Sure , it's an " Under Siege " rip-off , but that's no reason to miss it .
