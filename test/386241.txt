487556	386241	125967	1.0	Bad beyond your wildest imagination	" The Only Way To Spy " is not a movie . It is a random collection of images shown out of order . To say that it doesn't make sense would be an understatement ; any given scene has no connection to the previous or to the next one . There isn't a shred of talent or professionalism to be found in any frame of this picture . I'm surprised that not only it exists , but it also got a video release with a colorful video box cover that makes it look 100 times better than it actually is . It's supposed to be a soft-core action spy comedy : there is no spying , no comedy , very little - and badly filmed - action , and , infrequently , some naked breasts . The busty actress who plays " OO6 " is game enough , and with a different cast and crew around her , she could have been the lead in a genuinely sexy spy spoof . My first " 0 stars " rating in 2007 !
487208	386241	296042	1.0	Utterly worthless .	" Ichi The Killer " ' s violence makes " Reservoir Dogs " look like " Snow White " . Its visual " style " makes MTV video directors look like cutting-edge , brilliant artists . And its plot makes most Steven Seagal story lines seem intelligent . Writing a long review about something so meaningless is meaningless in itself , so I'll sum up the movie in four words : revolting , incomprehensible , numbing , overlong . For anyone who liked , say , " Nekromantik " , it's a sure bet ; for all others . . . stars . P . S . I watched the uncut version on a DVD that included an interview with director Takashi . The guy is a pretty boring talker , too .
486969	386241	82776	1.0	Sickening trash .	Sickening exploitation trash plays like a bad ( and reverse ) " Death Wish " ripoff - but the ugly and untalented Tamerlis makes Charles Bronson look like Al Pacino with her performance . As for Ferrara's " stylish " direction , when a film is so vile , dumb and deeply offensive , it's hard for the viewer to pay attention to such details .
485816	386241	74080	2.0	Artless junk .	This film was ineptly directed , badly acted and poorly written . It was artless junk , populated exclusively by moronic and unpleasant characters . But the most depressing thought that crossed my mind while I was watching this film is that , unfortunately , grade-Z exploitationers like this often develop a cult reputation , just because they are so bad and sleazy and amateurish . Any smart viewer will know better , of course .
486977	386241	100581	2.0	Proceed at your own risk .	As a director , Dario Argento may very well be a master of the horror genre . But as a screenwriter , he has already proved that , more often than not , he doesn't have a clue . The script he has co-written for " The Sect " is so awful that I am inclined to believe there wasn't any script to begin with - they were probably making it up as they went along . The movie is simply a series of disconnected scenes that were thrown together in the vain hope that they would form some sort of " plot " . The result is a torturous piece of schlock that bored me to tears . This one should get stars , but I'll change it to 0 . 5 for the cool " face ripping " scene , and for the fun of seeing an aging Giovani Lombardo Radice in a minor role , ten years after " Cannibal Ferox " . Still , it apparently has its fans so you may want to check it out for yourself . . . .
486892	386241	178917	2.0	Atrocious	Frank is a tough LA cop ( what else in new ? ) who's had it up to here with the red tape that's been making his life difficult ( what else is new ? ) , so he recruits three female prisoners ( an ex-cop , an ex-marine and a gang member ) and trains them to combat crime in his own unorthodox way . The premise may be completely unbelievable , but it's also the only reason one could possibly have for watching " Street Angels " in the first place , as it involves three fairly hot girls kicking a . Other than that , this " film " is very bad . There is virtually no budget on display , and the fight choreography is painfully bad . There are also constant attempts at wit , and most of them are just annoying ( the main villain just won't shut his damn mouth ! ) , but occasionally they do hit a good one ( my favorite : " You'll name our team Street Angels ? That sounds like a bad no-budget action movie " ! ) .
485760	386241	74920	2.0	Lethargically paced , ludicrously dubbed dullness .	A funny thing happened to me while watching " Mosquito " : on the one hand , the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does ( mutilating mannequins . . . er , excuse me , corpses ) through his images . On the other hand , the English version at least is very badly dubbed . So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time ! This film is stupid ( funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town ) and lurid ( where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene ? ) . Not to mention the " romantic " aspect ( oh , how sweet ! ) . . . Miss it . ( )
486867	386241	82237	2.0	Not much better than " Plan 9 From Outer Space " .	Grade-Z in all departments , " Dawn of the Mummy " is a film to watch only if you're desperate . Cinematography ( it looks like a home movie ) , acting ( complete with ear-piercing screaming ) , script ( incomprehensible ) , directing ( incompetent ) . . . . just about everything here is unbelievably bad . Except perhaps for the makeup effects , which are sometimes decent , particularly in the finale . But will you still be watching the movie by then ? Doubtful . ( )
486978	386241	95611	3.0	Fifth-rate but sometimes amusing slasher film .	From a horror standpoint , " Memorial Valley Massacre " is a worthless slasher that no serious horror fan should bother with . What saves it from being a total bomb is the tongue-in-cheek approach of the filmmakers , at least in the first half . For example , early on a man says " We've got a problem with the water " ( the movie is set on a camp ) and proceeds to pull a dead dog out of the well ! Hilarious ! Then Cameron Mitchell ( who appears for about 2 minutes as an investor ; did he actually get paid for this ? ) asks : " Screw the dog , is the water fit to drink ? " ( ! ! ! ) . The film also includes the following exchange : " Are you the head ranger here ? " - " Well , I'm the only ranger here , so I guess you can say I'm the head one " . Oh , and the primitive kid who has lived all his life away from civilization , apparently knows how to create a gas explosion . ( )
486261	386241	66449	3.0	What planet is this film taking place on ?	Annoying , static comedy with a painfully miscast Peter Sellers as a smarmy , self-centered Casanova who always has his way with the ladies . A major blemish on Sellers ' filmography , and , even worse , a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star . ( )
487548	386241	74296	3.0	Dismal " comedy " demeans Fenech	Ugo Tognazzi is a lawyer whose flight to New York is canceled due to extreme fog and he goes back to his house , only to find a man hidden in the closet while his wife appears to be sleeping . Actually , he just sees the man's feet but he doesn't bother to find out who he is ( if he did , this whole cockamamie story would be over before it started ) ; he locks the room , goes back to bed with his wife as if nothing had happened and spends the rest of the movie fantasizing about whom the guilty party might be , while in real life each and every one of his " suspects " turn out to have solid alibis . Admittedly , I saw a poorly dubbed version of this movie , titled " Who MisLaid My Wife ? " , so perhaps something has been lost in the translation . What does come through , however , is a dismal , monotonous " comedy " , with alternately ridiculous and tasteless ( and sometimes both ) fantasy sequences . Edwige Fenech looks GORGEOUS in this film , but her role is very demeaning ; she is continuously insulted , publicly embarrassed and , at one point , nearly raped . As for her nudity , it is limited to those fantasy scenes , and it is rarely arousing . ( )
486298	386241	102128	3.0	A muddled , self-indulgent film	" Iron Maze " has an intriguing script : the story of an attempted murder is unraveled through a series of conflicting flashbacks . Sadly , this script has been poorly directed , poorly photographed and poorly acted . The result is a muddled , unpleasant and self-indulgent film . Jeff Fahey is typically obnoxious , while Bridget Fonda looks pretty and enigmatic , but she doesn't really have to act to achieve those qualities ; her actual performance is closer to a zombie than a living human being . And J . T . Walsh plays ( surprise ! ) an officer of the law . The movie also has xenophobic political implications ( " those evil Japanese ! " ) , which it tries to reverse in the final scene . ( )
486068	386241	82084	3.0	Cheap , illogical , sloppy , offensive .	When you make a film with a killer-kids premise , there are two effective ways to approach it ; you can either make it as realistic as possible , creating believable characters and situations , or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs ( something which the makers of " Silent Night , Deadly Night " did , for example , on an equally controversial subject : a killer Santa ) . The people who made " Bloody Birthday " , however , do neither of those things ; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun ( or a knife , or a noose , or an arrow ) in his / her hand . The result is both offensive and stupid . The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production ( and then kept from release for several years ) . It's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids , but it's VERY sloppily made . ( )
487004	386241	174336	3.0	Revolting " comedy " .	Extremely vulgar and totally forgettable , " Whipped " obviously aspires to be a male version of the popular TV series " Sex and the City " , and indeed , just like that show , seems to be taking place on an alternate universe , where people spend their whole days talking dirty and roaming the streets trying to " stuff " , " pork " and " nail " ( to use the movie's language ) anything that moves . You'd have to be a real masochist to want to spend 80 ( and thank God they are only 80 ) minutes in the company of these characters , who seem to possess the emotional maturity of 5-year-olds , and whose vocabulary consists of about 20 words ( the most popular ones have four letters and begin with " f " and " d " ) . As for the plot , it's so predictable that you can guess its " twists " just by looking at the video box cover . ( )
486794	386241	105496	3.0	Only for those who prefer flying-fu to kung-fu	Whoa ! I don't think I've seen such a collection of beautiful Asian women all in one movie since " The Inspector Wears Skirts " : Cynthia Khan , the young girl that hooks up with the hero , the hero's former girlfriend , the female police officer , the villain's girlfriend ( ESPECIALLY her ) , they all re-affirm my idea that Asian women between the ages of 20 and 40 are sexy as hell . Unfortunately , that's about the only worthwhile aspect of " Super Lady Cop " . Of course , I realize that people have different tastes , and if you like incoherent stories and silly , sped-up , over-the-top fight scenes with people flying , swirling , jumping , bouncing and rolling like balls , you'll love this film . If , on the other hand , you prefer stories that make sense and fight scenes that allow the stars to show their real abilities , then look for something else . IMO , films like " Super Lady Cop " and " Angel On Fire " are the ones to blame for the fact that Cynthia Khan never achieved as much fame and recognition as she could have , even among genre devotees . ( ) Note : it's possible that there are various versions of this movie out there . On my subtitled DVD version , Cynthia never actually transforms into Chun Li as another reviewer described , although she IS referred to by that name throughout the movie .
485713	386241	82377	3.0	A huge disappointment	After the wonderful " Omen " and the interesting ( if inferior ) " Omen II " , did we really need this ? It's a huge disappointment , a cheap-looking movie that lacks tension and is full of blah dialogue . The ending will make you angry .
486391	386241	122603	4.0	Strictly by-the-numbers .	Old-fashioned horror film is yet another entry in the " man vs nature " sub-genre , of which the granddaddy was , of course , Hitchcock's brilliant " The Birds " . Don't look for anything comparable here : this strictly by-the-numbers film is barely thrilling , and the computer-animated effects too often look fake ( even the EXPLOSIONS look fake ! ) . The actors are game , but they play generally uninteresting characters . Still , it's painless enough .
486606	386241	91209	4.0	A huge disappointment .	This film doesn't really live up to its cult reputation . Sure , it's reasonably suspenseful at times , but very short on sense , and , overall , a huge disappointment . Hauer is creepy enough , but the film fails completely when it tries for " depth " : there is no sense of " relationship " between the characters - a thoroughly evil man torments a thoroughly innocent man . And why are all the cops so dumb ? And how many explosions does a " psychological " thriller need ?
487112	386241	87852	4.0	Lifeless , low-grade tale .	This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work , a lifeless , muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace ( and the budget ! ) of its predecessors ( " Death On The Nile " , " Evil Under The Sun " ) and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go ( of course , he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot ) . The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone ( all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest ) , but the direction is hopelessly flat . ( )
486268	386241	56601	4.0	Forgettable murder mystery .	Not having seen any of the previous versions of this story , the film this one reminded me more of is Lucio Fulci's ( ! ! ) 1990 shocker " Voices from Beyond " . The plotlines are different but still share some similarities , as they both involve revenge from beyond the grave , rich families with hidden secrets , a murder investigation carried out on behalf of the murdered man himself , etc . Unfortunately , " The Brain " takes an interesting sci-fi concept and turns it into a forgettable murder mystery ; you won't exactly be on the edge of your seat trying to figure out " who-did-it " . What's more , the chintzy production makes the movie look as if it were made in the 40s . ( )
487539	386241	100867	4.0	Garbage , but Ginger makes it smell a little better	" Vice Academy 2 " is worth sitting through only for Ginger Lynn Allen : she is cute , she appears in black lingerie , she wears a revealing dress , she performs ( along with Linnea Quigley ) a strip dance , and she throws one mean right punch . Other than her , the film is so PAINFULLY drawn-out , so insultingly lame , so persistently witless that you simply won't believe it ( just one example : what a brilliant idea to create a powerful half-woman / half-robot crime-fighter and then put a switch on its back that anyone can easily move to " worthless " or " overload " mode ) . If complete lack of talent was a crime , writer-director Rick Sloane would be serving a life sentence . My rating is pretty generous for this one . ( )
486101	386241	175694	4.0	Low-rent blaxploitation / private eye tale	The blaxploitation fad was already in decline in the late 70's , and films like " The Guy From Harlem " were made . " Shaft " or " Black Belt Jones " this is not . It does have a funky score ( " that cat is a baaaaad dude " ) , some beautiful black women and occasionally amusing dialogue . But the production is completely amateurish - there are quite a few cases of fumbled lines that remained in the final cut , probably because the producers couldn't afford second takes . It's billed as an action film , but it's mostly talk : virtually all of the action is fight scenes , and virtually all of the fight scenes are comically bad , playground-level . The fighting in this movie is even worse than the fighting in " T . N . T Jackson " - and that really should tell you something . ( )
485603	386241	65506	4.0	Very unslick .	The fact that Henri Charriere , whose life was dramatized in " Papillon " with Steve McQueen in 1973 , wrote the script for this caper film and also has a supporting role in it may make some people willing to check it out , mostly out of curiosity . But don't be fooled ; it's an ( initially ) muddled , padded and unexpectedly unslick picture . Not even Claudia Cardinale in a low-cut dress can make it worth watching . ( )
487529	386241	95304	4.0	Strange , loud fiasco .	Despite some atmospheric moments , some OK special effects and likable performances by Peter O'Toole and Steve Guttenberg ( Daryl Hannah is too " soft " ; Beverly D'Angelo is disappointing ) , this film is a fiasco . It suffers from special effects overkill , and the plot , which potentially contains some interesting developments , makes little sense . I think I'll have forgotten all about this film by tomorrow . . . ( )
487384	386241	91828	4.0	One of Arnie's least remembered movies , and deservedly so .	The premise of this familiar actioner had some potential , with Arnold Schwarzenegger getting to act like a " bad guy " at least for a while , but unfortunately the theme is " explored " in just ONE scene , where he admits that he likes his new lifestyle as the right hand of a mob boss . But eventually he loses his patience , gets his machine gun and decides to wipe out the bad guys the old-fashioned way . And the viewer is inevitably going to wonder : why did they torture us for over an hour with all the secret-agent business , just to get to a " Commando " - type final showdown , where Arnie is able to kill dozens of enemies simply because they are too stupid and slow to get him first ? There is no answer to that question , and that's what makes this film ultimately excruciating . ( )
487314	386241	91836	4.0	Failure . A movie that doesn't know what it wants to be	Neither a serious WIP drama , like director Tom De Simone's earlier " The Concrete Jungle " , nor an outright spoof of the genre in the style of " Naked Gun " , " Reform School Girls " is a film that suffers from identity crisis . The serious , sometimes even cruel moments offset the comedy , and the over-the-top moments undermine the seriousness . For a film categorized by Leonard Maltin as a spoof , it's quite astonishing how few not only laughs , but even attempts at comedy this one really contains . It's not a total loss : rocker Wendy O . Williams ( who also sings on the soundtrack ) has an incredible , ROCKING 37-year-old body which she proudly displays throughout ( RIP Wendy ) , and there is some nice girl vs . girl wrestling . But Sybil Danning , the big " name " of the film , is COMPLETELY wasted - if you're thinking of seeing this for her , forget it . ( )
486008	386241	65656	4.0	Poor version of classic story	There is only one good thing about this " Dorian Gray " : Helmut Berger's ideal casting in the title role . Impossibly handsome , he is credible both in his innocence ( early on ) and his corruption ( later on ) . That is the only thing this movie does right , however ; nothing else . The choppy continuity ( Dorian falls in love in the first three minutes . . . he " changes " after twenty minutes . . . and so on ) renders the story shallow and meaningless . The film obviously wants to " suggest " a lot ( including belt-whippings , lesbianism and oral sex ) , but is so tame and timid in doing it that it could possibly get by with a " PG " rating today . By the time Berger drops the soap in his shower and a straight-faced Herbert Lom picks it up , the whole thing has become a farce . I haven't seen the more famous 1945 version , but it has GOT to be better than this one ! ( )
485942	386241	91752	4.0	Goes from embarrassingly awful to enjoyably awful . . . .	. . . . and that happens at around the 50-minute mark , when Sybil ( as a character in the film exclaims , " WOW ! " ) Danning appears , well-cast as a fighting alien queen . Up until then " The Phantom Empire " is a plodding , sleep-inducing trek , and the cannibals with Halloween masks over their faces and old rags for clothes are beneath Z-grade cinema . The sole bright spot is Michelle Bauer as a bikini-clad " cave bunny " . After Danning's entrance , the viewer can at least focus on her phenomenal figure , and it's easier to forgive the unimpressive stop-motion animation effects ( I think " One Million Years B . C . " , from 1965 , has a better dinosaur battle than the one featured here ) . But if you want to see something from Fred Olen Ray that looks more like a real film and less like a college project , seek out his " Cyclone " from the following year . ( ) P . S . : To claim that you watched this film " for the dinosaurs " is like claiming that you watched " Jurassic Park " for the T & A .
487221	386241	83232	4.0	Hugely disappointing .	Hugely disappointing , totally unabsorbing , lethargically paced and practically plotless film . The acting is , as you might expect , of a high order , and the closing moments are very fine , but the story generates little interest and the film is about as cinematically exciting as an average episode of an average TV series . ( )
487264	386241	86947	4.0	Contrived	Made and acted ( amateurishly ) by unknowns , this bland thriller sets up its contrived main situation right from the opening sequence - and then goes nowhere you haven't been before ( voyeurism , murder , the wrong man suspected , etc ) . All-too-obviously ( and all-too-intentionally ) reminiscent of " Rear Window " , but there's just no comparison . ( )
485605	386241	87032	4.0	Unfocused and long .	This film was really no better or worse than the original , it was essentially more of the same old stuff . Hal Needham still finds plenty of opportunities to fill the screen with stunts and there are several scenes of cars crashing through walls , flying in the air and dragging along entire houses with them , but the race has absolutely no urgency - at times you even forget there IS a race ! The participants just don't seem very interested in winning . Maybe the movie is worth seeing just because it's your only chance to see Frank Sinatra , Richard Kiel and Jackie Chan in the same picture , but don't expect to see them doing anything important ; the wandering script understandably gets lost among all those famous players , and the good moments are few and far between . ( )
487382	386241	113732	4.0	Failure . . . .	How low is Burt Reynolds willing to stoop , during this late phase of his career ? Apparently pretty low indeed , judging from this tedious thriller that was barely released theatrically . Reynolds seems miscast in his change-of-pace villainous role , and the snail-like pacing and poor production values remove most of the " entertainment value " this movie might had possessed . ( )
487013	386241	82511	4.0	Watching this film isn't hell . . . but it's close .	I finally got around to watching this one ( it mysteriously proved to be pretty hard to find ) , and it was not worth the wait . It begins with some promise , but soon becomes a forgettable horror thriller , with too dark photography , and a killer who violates all the laws of logic by having to be " killed " about seven times , and also by being able to teleport himself from one place to another . And , with apologies to Linda Blair fans , she makes a very dull , wimpy , uninspiring heroine here . ( )
486608	386241	67329	4.0	Tedious film .	Tedious , utterly pointless crime yarn . After the five opening minutes , you have already started wondering why this movie was made . The movie ends and it still hasn't provided the answer to that question . Scott is an excellent , magnetic actor , but he is fighting against fourth-rate material here . . . . and he loses .
485921	386241	239670	4.0	Mortally overlong .	The premise is good , but the movie isn't . It's excessively talky and fatally overlong . For Christ's sake , man , this thing goes on for what seems like four centuries and never really gets anywhere . The segment about the dead body that has to be removed takes up most of the movie , and it's tiresome ( many movies have done this sort of thing better ) , though it does give Beineix the opportunity to stage some nice Hitchcockian scenes ( like one involving a blind man in an elevator ) . Overall , if you're looking for a good contemporary French thriller , stick with " With A Friend Like Harry " . ( )
485912	386241	86625	4.0	Moronic vigilante epic .	It begins with a couple of disgusting sex-comedy gags , but soon it reveals its true colors : it wants to be a " Death Wish " clone . I say " wants to " because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an absurdist " Death Wish " spoof ! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles , to " heroes " who dress up as commandoes and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves ( ! ) , to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle , this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list . The other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart ; of course , you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are , but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes , and you wouldn't know the difference . ( )
487487	386241	86192	4.0	Boring .	" Revenge of the Ninja " got a vote of " 4 " from me , which means that it was a considerable improvement ( I think ) over the the exceedingly dull " Enter the Ninja " , to which I gave . It's still not a very good movie , though . Actually , it's only standard , boring kung-fu stuff , with lots of action and a " who-cares " plot . Apparently , the people who made this thought that graphic violence could camouflage the lack of interesting characters and the childish script ( they were wrong ) . As for Sho Kosugi , his fighting skills are no match for those of Bruce Lee , and his acting talents can best be described as " nonexistent " . And was that final , interminable showdown supposed to be exciting ?
485739	386241	79522	4.0	Overrated - to say the least .	Many films that remain even today wildly overrated come from the 70's . They are films that have either aged badly ( " Jaws " ) or were never any good in the first place ( " The French Connection " ) , and continue to receive excessive praise over the years , without really deserving it . " Manhattan " should be included in that list . This is a comedy with very few laughs , and a drama with four main characters but only with ONE who has any depth ; Woody Allen's . The other three are superficial caricatures . And who thought it was such a wise idea to make Keaton's character so unlikable ? It's depressing for anyone who remembers how sweet and lovely she was in " Play It Again , Sam " . As for Mariel Hemingway's performance , it could hardly be more forced . And the ending is so abrupt that you'll be surprised , but not pleasantly . Allen's most astonishing accomplishment in this movie may be that he actually managed to make New York City look perhaps more uninviting and unattractive than I've ever seen it before in the movies . Even films than focus on its " ugly " , crime-infested side manage to suggest that there is life in this city , that it's exciting and thrilling . Here it looks just DRAB . Yes , the background music is wonderful , but the b / w cinematography isn't particularly beautiful - there were many scenes that would benefit greatly if they were filmed in color . After reading all the reviews and comments about this movie , I expected a lot more . It was a big disappointment . How can people prefer this to the vastly superior " Hannah And Her Sisters " ?
486751	386241	90934	4.0	Purposeless .	This movie will really give you better understanding of such terms as " purposeless " and " pointless " . It's simply a series of episodes , which never add up to anything . The only thing one can recommend about this familiar drama ( which still doesn't make it worthwhile ) is the solid acting : Barkin's performance stands out .
485848	386241	66093	5.0	Lacks focus .	Noble intentions do not necessarily make a satisfying film . " Monte Walsh " has good acting , a good score and generally good sequences scattered about . . . . BUT , it's just not terribly interesting . There's just not enough action here - physical OR emotional . The script lacks focus and most of the time it seems to meander around with no particular purpose . A no more than OK film . ( )
486707	386241	88044	5.0	I have seen this film before - it was called " Class of 1984 " then	Seriously , replace Linda Blair's vigilante high school student with Perry King's vigilante high school teacher , change a few other minor details , and you have that exploitation film instead of this one . Blair makes a terrific , fiery " bad girl " , with some classic one-liners ( " it's a pity you're not double-jointed . . . . because if you were you'd be able to bend over and kiss your a$$ goodbye ! " ) , but overall this film is little more than a typical , simpleminded revenge piece : bad things happen to people Linda cares about , so Linda goes on the revenge path . It's a film that you watch more for its nostalgic value ( as everything in it , from the music to the clothes to the high school settings , gives off that 80's " vibe " ) rather than for its artistic one , which , to be honest , is pretty limited . ( )
486466	386241	105399	5.0	Terrible but fun .	By any objective standards , this movie is absolutely terrible . The direction is extremely sloppy , the " special effects " ( though undeniably time-consuming ) are pathetically obvious and the script . . . well , let's just not go there . Nevertheless , it does boast some witty , top-notch fight choreography and some legitimately funny moments , so Jackie fanatics may want to give it a look . But if you're new to Hong Kong action cinema , don't make " Twin Dragons " your introduction to it : you'll have a hard time believing that a movie this bad can actually be produced anywhere in this world . ( )
486812	386241	95296	5.0	Very minor .	Chuck Norris is better than usual here . He's still not much of an actor , but at least he gets the rare chance to portray some human emotions like fear and doubt , and he also gets to flash his appealing smile . But the rest of the movie is a tiresome , familiar cop thriller ( with slasher-flick overtones ) , and it's amazingly skimpy on plot . The climax does not meet our expectations , either . ( )
485750	386241	69920	5.0	How did that woman get yellow all of a sudden ?	This disappointing giallo does offer some atmospheric sequences and lots of nudity , but the story progresses in a very fragmented fashion , making it hard for the viewer to even tell the characters apart , and the gore effects are embarrassing , actually some of the worst I've ever seen in an Italian horror film . As for the identity of the killer , I have to admit the movie fooled me into a wrong guess . However , that doesn't say much ; considering " Torso " ' s obvious disregard for credible motivation , the killer could have been just about anyone . ( )
486090	386241	87481	5.0	A two-joke comedy	2 Bud Spencers and 2 Terence Hills in this one ; they play two Brazilian millionaires with many enemies AND their exact lookalikes , a saxophone player who is often in trouble with the law and a daring stuntman , who are hired by the millionaires to impersonate them for a week . No doubt you are familiar with the term " one-joke comedy " . Well , " Double Trouble " is a little better than that : it's a two-joke comedy . The first joke is that the rude and crude lookalikes try to adapt to the real millionaires ' lifestyle and end up turning it upside down , and the second is that only one Hill-Spencer pair can fight as usual ( guess which ) ; the other two are snobbish sissies who always run away from fights . It's fun to watch Hill and Spencer playing against type ( half the time ) , and Spencer in particular gives one of his most joyful performances . And the editing that allows all four of them to be on screen together in some scenes is seamless . But during the long segments between the fight scenes , I completely lost interest in the movie . ( )
486820	386241	109456	5.0	Perfectly bearable mystery .	Critically trashed erotic thriller is not so bad , actually . Bruce Willis brings his trademark likability to his role , Ruben Blades gives a spirited and funny little performance and the rest of the cast is decent , as well . What the movie lacks is pacing ; the direction , although technically competent , has no rhythm , and that , along with the fact that the plot gets too far-fetched , damages the film . It's a flabby and long yarn , but does have its enjoyable moments . ( )
486436	386241	290014	5.0	Very mediocre stuff	Even at the age of 45 , Cynthia Rothrock is a superb martial artist , but " Outside The Law " / " Never Say Die " is a mediocre vehicle for her . The plot is completely uninteresting , and the scattered fight scenes don't compensate for that , because a ) they are mostly shot in too-tight close-ups , b ) the editing is choppy , c ) the villains don't offer much of a challenge to Cynthia . Only James Lew is introduced as a worthy opponent , but even their fight scene at the end of the movie is not as long as it should have been . There is an amusing nod to Rothrock's Hong Kong film past ( " You can read Chinese ? " , her friend asks her - " Enough to order from a menu " , she responds ) . Sidenote : when an action film starts with a couple discussing how many kids ( and pets ) they will have when they get married , you know one of them is not going to be around for long . ( )
486964	386241	113253	5.0	Somewhat underrated .	This movie has its share of flaws : heavy doses of graphic gore , that almost degrade a series which began with a gore-less film , and moments that simply don't make sense - why does Myers kill his " collaborators " at the end ? Still , I found the attempts to explain his origin mostly fascinating . It's the easiest , the laziest and the greediest thing to present a killer without a motive and to keep bringing him back for more sequels even though he should be dead . Why do people say that this series never contained supernatural elements ? When Myers is shot six times in " Halloween " and nevertheless lives , was that " natural " ? Script and direction were a bit muddled , but not TOO muddled : I've never seen " Halloween 5 " , yet the plot made sense to me , even if some details didn't . The classic music score has been unfortunately altered , but as a whole this sixth entry seems to be somewhat underrated - " Halloween II " is much more boring . Fair acting , too .
486154	386241	109278	5.0	Ordinary .	Routine thriller that never rises above mediocrity , although the attractive and competent cast gives some class to an otherwise very modest and forgettable production . Still , it's watchable enough to stay in the two-star rating territory .
487353	386241	109198	5.0	Not bad , but half-hearted , attempt at a feminist Western	The idea of making a Western with women in the leading roles was an interesting one , but the casting was not exactly ideal . Don't get me wrong , the women in " Bad Girls " look great in their Western outfits , and they do a fine acting job as well , but only Drew Barrymore really convinces as a " bad girl " - you can see the fire of intensity burning in her eyes ( Madeleine Stowe is a close second - at times she is convincingly defiant ) . And for a " feminist " Western , the women get mistreated rather frequently . But the biggest problem with this film is an unfocused script that never really takes off . " Bad Girls " was a big commercial and critical flop , but I don't think it's such a bad movie - it's just not as good as it should have been . ( )
487327	386241	74751	5.0	Campy , but not a total disaster . . .	This ambitious remake of the 1933 classic is neither as bad nor as good as you may have heard from many different sources . It's just kind of " average " . In its first hour , about the only thing that keeps it going is Jessica Lange's gorgeousness ( she has a superbly well-defined figure , which is very often exposed ) . Then , the pace picks up and the special effects take over , but they are variable in quality ; sometimes Kong looks awesome , just like he should , but other scenes don't work at all ( the low points are his fight with a rubber snake and a scene at the end where Lange supposedly " touches " his bleeding body ) . What I disliked most of all here were the moments of campiness ( Kong grinning leeringly to Lange , Lange calling him a " big chauvinist ape " ) . But it's fairly entertaining , and the last 20 minutes are now historically important , too - for obvious reasons . ( )
486745	386241	100403	5.0	Inferior sequel .	Inferior , if not uninteresting , sequel to one of Arnold's best movies . While the original began as a Rambo-type actioner and then turned into a claustrophobic thriller , this one emphasizes action , shootouts and mayhem throughout . Extremely loud film , it is not recommended for people with " sensitive " ears . The one thing the filmmakers didn't compromise was the superiority of the Predator : humans are still defenseless against him , and there is no " happy ending " .
486381	386241	91990	5.0	Derivative , but not the worst of its type .	Mad killer escapes from an insane asylum and goes after his sister ( does this remind you of anything ? ) , with whom he shares an unexplained telepathic link . This film is not too bad of its type , but it's just too derivative of both " Halloween " and " Nightmare on Elm Street " ( there are many ominous dream sequences ) . The main heroine is fairly engaging , but the rest of the characters are almost indistinguishable from one another ( and the men are badly acted , too ) . ( )
485859	386241	86960	5.0	Cliched , brainless but watchable .	If one of the characteristics of a great film is that is stands the test of time , then " Beverly Hills Cop " is by no means a great film . Almost everything about this comedy-actioner looks already dated today , including Eddie Murphy's persona . Although there are undeniably some comic highlights , the movie is sunk by its painfully cliched and unoriginal script which makes it feel programmed and destroys all the suspense elements . But Steven Berkoff makes a calmly effective villain and the film is OK fare if you're undemanding . ( )
487128	386241	90342	5.0	We need more Jackie and Yuen Biao .	The script is totally incoherent ( something about a letter that could expose a criminal organization . . . don't even bother to think about it ) , and most of the comedy is lame , but the action is fast and exhilarating . Jackie has a small part and barely any dialogue in this one ; I also would have liked to see more of the gifted Yuen Biao , who has a way of making even the most amazing stunts seem effortless . Sammo Hung gets the lion's share of the fighting , and at the end he is pitted against Richard Norton , one of the most worthy villains of Jackie Chan movies . I give " Twinkle " for the comedy and for the action , so the average is .
486316	386241	239948	5.0	Witless / Harmless .	Steve Zahn is a funny guy . Amanda Peet is a sexy girl . And the film has energy in spades . What it lacks is wit : the humor is mostly moronic and obviously aimed at the less discriminating audiences . Despite an element of misogyny , however , the film isn't as annoying as Peet's previous " vehicle " , " Whipped " . ( )
486651	386241	79351	5.0	Below-par Hill & Spencer entry .	The Hill & Spencer movies were never famous for their brilliant stories , but this one doesn't even make an effort . Plotless , slow-paced , boring and only occasionally amusing , it feels like a film that was made out of obligation , rather than like something that the stars and the filmmakers put their hearts in . At least with its animal-friendly messages you could say it's good for kids , but no - they'll be as bored with it as anyone else . ( )
486801	386241	377607	5.0	Definitely watchable but lacking in thrills	I watched this movie mainly to see Erika Eleniak . The good news is that she looks more gorgeous than usual in this one . The bad news is that , although she plays a special agent of the Justice Department , she has little in the way of real action apart from running around waving a gun - she doesn't even get to kill one person ! The movie is watchable mainly thanks to its cast - in addition to Eleniak , there is a cute and likable Brigitta Dau , Kim Coates as a fairly complex villain ( he has no hesitation about killing people but at the same time he honestly loves Eleniak and doesn't want to get her hurt ) , and Stacy Keach and Erin Gray as an amusingly offbeat married couple of middle-aged assassins . But in the last 30 minutes " Caught in the Headlights " is caught by its low budget , and the action gets limited to watching all those characters endlessly running around in an abandoned mill . This stretched-out climax is definitely the weakest part of the movie . ( )
487203	386241	94374	5.0	Disappointing actioner .	Cynthia Rothrock is a phenomenal martial-arts dynamo ( although in some scenes she is stupidly replaced by a male stunt man ) , and Yuen Biao is . . . . well , Yuen Biao , if you've seen him in even one Jackie Chan movie you already know what he can do . The sheer action involving these two almost redeems the rest of the movie . ALMOST . As film-making , it's sloppy and confusing and just plain bad . Plus , the downbeat ending leaves a bad taste in your mouth and kills any fun the viewer might have had until then . ( )
485631	386241	79837	5.0	Gorgeous women , mediocre film	Three comic skits set in Milan . The first is lame , worth seeing only for a few glimpses of Edwige Fenech's body ( I doubt that many Japanese women - she plays one here - wear what she wears after taking a shower ) . The second is the best : Michele Placido is by far the best comic actor in the film - he doesn't push for laughs , so he gets some . The third is pointless , and unfortunately the longest ; an example of its idea of humor is the overdrawn homosexual caricature of Celentano's right-hand man . Final recommendation : fast-forward through the first skit to get to the " good " Fenech bits , watch the second in its entirety and skip the third altogether . ( )
485752	386241	21165	5.0	Dull Hitchcock .	Ponderous , plodding , dull Hitchcock thriller ( and to think I saw the shortened , American version ! ) , with interminable dialogue passages and little action . The director finds room for a few peculiar touches ( like the unanimous " Any answer to that , Sir John ? " in the " jury deliberation " sequence ) , but this film is only for his most ardent fans . The disgracefully ( and , at times , almost amusingly ) poor print quality is no help . ( )
485632	386241	264395	6.0	Too much of a good thing .	Plot twists are like some pills : take a few and they're good for you , take too many and they can seriously damage your health . The trailers for " Basic " look exciting , it has a dream cast ( I could listen to Samuel Jackson swearing all day long ) , . . . . indeed for about an hour or so , this is an unusually absorbing film ; you feel like you're " in " the action , not just watching it . But it doesn't know when to quit ; there comes a point when even the purpose of the investigation itself is cancelled out . And the ending practically ruins the entire film ( much like it happens in another good-until-the-end thriller , " Under Suspicion " ) . The original ending , which is mentioned in some of the other comments , sounds somewhat more reasonable . ( )
487051	386241	78158	6.0	Stupid but palatable .	This corny sequel to " Escape To Witch Mountain " is full of stupid and convenient plot devices ( smart goat ! ) , the performances by the kids are awkward , Bette Davis and an obviously slumming Christopher Lee are here only to lure some adults into thinking the movie might have some interest for them too ( it doesn't ) and the special effects run hot and cold ( some good , some embarrassments ) . Despite all that , the film does have a few good ideas , such as pitting the two " magical " kids against each other for much of the duration . Of course , they are both so obnoxious that I was secretly hoping they would go ahead and kill each other off , but no such luck ; this is Disney , after all . ( )
487151	386241	101320	6.0	" Ambition " certainly doesn't lack ambition . . .	. . . but the result is only partially successful . Part of the problem is that the narrative plods to such a degree that for the most part the whole film seems pointless . It's only in the last 30 minutes or so that you realize what Lou Diamond Phillips ( who wrote the script and stars ) was up to ( SPOILERS FOLLOW ) : he cleverly and subtly reverses the usual genre formulas , turning his character , who is supposed to be the hero and the person for the audience to identify with , into the real villain of the film , while the now cured ( ? ) , ex-psychopathic killer , who is shown to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown throughout the movie , turns out to be the character who must save the day ! ( END OF SPOLIERS ) . So this is one of those rare films where you don't know where the story is going just by looking at the video cover , and that alone makes it somewhat recommendable . ( )
486445	386241	78055	6.0	A lot of sex , a little gore and an anti-imperialist message !	If you're looking for gore in this film , you'll probably be disappointed . Apart from two brief moments of cannibalism and the slaughtering of two dead pigs , there is nothing else worth mentioning . I believe that this time D'Amato's heart was more in the erotic aspect . And he either got lucky or he got smart with the casting here , because it is spot-on : the actress who plays Papaya has a face that looks a little like Pam Grier's and a body to die for ( and some men do ! ) , and the blonde female lead is even more gorgeous , and a fairly capable actress as well . The true climax of the film is a 3-minute lesbian scene between them that is very well-done - one for the anthology books , as these things go . To sum up , as a horror film this gets a but as an erotic film it gets a .
486216	386241	108565	6.0	A beautiful but muddled film . . . .	Sumptuous-looking , beautifully photographed , meticulously produced . . . . this movie seems to do everything right visually . But its story , very engaging in the first half , runs out of steam in the second . Story points and character motivations are often muddled , and I never got a complete and clear idea of where and when exactly the passionate love affair between the two basic characters started to go wrong . And yes , it is sometimes erotic ( mostly thanks to the very beautiful Karina Lombard ) , but it never becomes as steamy as you may have heard . ( )
487114	386241	109303	6.0	Familiar but enjoyable .	Nothing more than a formula action picture , a studio product , but well-done and fairly enjoyable . Stephen Hopkins proves ( again , after " Predator 2 " ) to be adept at filming frenetic action scenes and he shows confidence in the way he uses the camera , especially in the " long shots " . Tommy Lee Jones is kind of one-note as the villain , and not very satisfying , but Jeff Bridges gives depth and credibility to his role , and the supporting cast is above-average . Oh , and there ARE some spectacular explosions . ( )
485853	386241	109254	6.0	Passable , mildly enjoyable .	Passable action comedy , certainly not as bad as its reputation suggests . The emphasis is on the action , with some good stuntwork , but there a few mildly funny comic bits as well . Although he works with recycled material here , Eddie Murphy comes through with a likable performance , and the direction is less loud and aggressive , more well-balanced and cool than Tony Scott's work in " BHC II " . ( )
486414	386241	57193	6.0	Mammoth comedy that could have been funnier .	Gigantic car-chase comedy is somewhat better than the similar " Great Race " ( made two years later ) , but that's not much of a compliment . The pacing is highly inconsistent , because there are too many side trips and Spencer Tracy shows a rather heavy spirit , and the mammoth length diminishes its comic power considerably . Still , it has its undeniably enjoyable moments and a good , delirious climax . ( )
486637	386241	83336	6.0	Just a few worthwhile parts . . . .	Essentially a monster feature ( complete with ecological messages ) , given an " arty " treatment . Visually , it's quite interesting - there are many great tracking shots from the wolves ' point-of-view , in which weird color filters and other tricks were used cleverly . I also found the gore effects remarkably convincing . But the narrative often plods , and Albert Finney's performance is perhaps the weakest part of the entire film ; he just seems thoroughly disinterested and resigned . ( )
487370	386241	100404	6.0	Overplotted and stagy , but fairly compelling .	When I had watched this film a few years ago for the first time , my overall impression was highly negative ; I found it to be a boring , stagy courtroom thriller unworthy of its great cast . Now that I watched it again , more attentively , I STILL find Pakula's direction overly stagy , but some virtues do begin to show up . Undoubtedly , the casting is the main one : the movie is filled with terrific supporting performances , from Raul Julia as an incredibly clever counselor to Bonnie Bedelia as the frustrated wife . Harrison Ford himself is very good ( although with a bad haircut ) in one of his unconventional roles . But the movie has too many plot threads , some of which could have easily been omitted to make the whole story shorter and more tense . ( )
486760	386241	104823	6.0	Respectable low-budget martial arts film	The plot is nothing new ( police corruption , a crime syndicate that uses a night club as a front , a cop investigating the death of his partner , etc . ) but the fight scenes range from good to very good ( the best one might be an illegal 2-on-1 that doesn't involve any of the leads ) . Maybe they can't match up to the best that Hong Kong has to offer , but they are choreographed in a way that showcases the fighters ' power , speed and technique . My two main disappointments with this film are : 1 ) as already reported by another reviewer , VERY short final fight between Cynthia Rothrock and the female bodyguard ( what a bummer ! ) , and 2 ) no arch-villain role for the master of such roles , Billy Drago ( he's just a corrupted police chief ) . ( )
486065	386241	74806	6.0	All setup , no payoff .	Jodie Foster is indeed impressively good in this movie , and she is perhaps the only actress who could have pulled off such a challenging role at such a young age . However , the script is disappointing . It's the kind of story that keeps you watching by implying that many big revelations will be made , and when the revelations do arrive they prove to be less-than-shocking . There's only one moment in the film ( when the seemingly vanished father appears ) that it looks like there's gonna be a REAL SURPRISE , but that moment lasts only about 20 seconds , in which you have enough time to guess what is actually happening . Worth seeing only for Foster , and for her co-stars who are all very good , too . ( )
486717	386241	109758	6.0	Has its faults , but still is quite daring .	This film tiptoes around its " controversial " subject ( sadomasochism ) , and Dana Delany is terribly miscast and always unconvincing as a dominatrix - for example Iman , who co-stars here , would be a much better choice for the role of Mistress Lisa . But , for a mainstream Hollywood picture , this is still pretty daring and unusual . As others have said , the many different genres and styles employed here inevitably clash , and make the film inconsistent - but at least it's never boring . Not for kids . ( )
487115	386241	71200	6.0	Had the potential to be better , but still interesting .	This low-budget horror film had an innovative concept , mixing rather successfully a traditional Agatha Christie-type murder mystery with a " gory " werewolf flick ; the result does hold your attention but is marred by wooden acting ( except for the excellent Peter Cushing ) and a few overextended chase scenes . As another reviewer noted , no real clues are given to us to help us figure out the identity of the werewolf , so it's strictly a matter a guessing , but there is some fun in the game . . . ( )
486105	386241	60121	6.0	Too gimmicky and not up to " Charade " .	Stanley Donen's follow-up to his very entertaining 1963 " Charade " is a more than similar film ( the opening credits are almost identical ! ) , but , unfortunately , it is a step down . Peter Stone's script is absurdly convoluted and too " clever " for its own good ; Donen's direction is gimmicky , lacking the simplicity and effectiveness of his work in the earlier film ; Gregory Peck delivers his supposedly witty lines flatly and makes an unsuccessful effort to imitate Cary Grant's mannerisms ; and Sophia Loren basically exists in the movie for the one scene where she shows off her gorgeous legs . The only aspect in which " Arabesque " is superior to " Charade " is its visual look : this movie glitters ! And if you watch it twice ( like I did , because my first reaction was too negative ) , you'll find out that there are some scenes that actually work ( for example , the interrogation in the van ) . ( )
486035	386241	86618	6.0	More swordfights than laughs .	" Yellowbeard " has some funny moments , but with THIS cast , it should have been much better . There is perhaps too much attention to the production values , at the expense of comedy . The " plot " is cluttered and chaotic . And Monty Python fans will probably be disappointed because , although the film has many of their members in big or small roles , it never makes the leap to surrealism ( come on , couldn't they have come up with some clever jokes during the title cards ? ) . However , as I said , there are enough funny moments for this to get a rating .
486638	386241	105631	6.0	OK diversion .	Overheated but good-looking and fairly entertaining murder mystery that will probably please most whodunit fans , despite ( or , for some viewers , perhaps BECAUSE of ) its overly convoluted plot , which may even demand a second viewing to get completely straightened out in one's head . James Belushi gets to show some ambiguity that's rare for him , but Lorraine Bracco's femme fatale is a barely sexy disappointment . ( )
485694	386241	82334	6.0	Fairly successful , but it goes on forever .	The outstanding performances of Barbara Hershey ( who is stunningly beautiful ) and Ron Silver ( who has a rather irritating role as a stupidly stubborn psychologist ) lift this film above the average level of most similar supernatural thrillers . But it seems to go on FOREVER . Overlength really diminishes the power of this film . It's very well-directed ( I think director Furie is a very talented man ; he also made " The Ipcress File " ) but the story has almost nowhere to go and it progresses very slowly . Still , a fairly good horror entry .
486828	386241	110134	6.0	Delivers the goods - those goods you should expect at least	" Indecent Bahavior II " is probably close to " as good as it gets " in the soft-core erotic thriller market . The reasons are simple : the " erotic " parts are fairly sensual and explicit , and the " thriller " ( or rather , " whodunit " ) parts , although VERY contrived , at least manage to hold enough interest in-between the erotic parts . The cast and the production values are decent . Shannon Tweed plays a Beverly Hills " sex therapist " with rather unorthodox methods ( which include hiring women to have sex with unknown men to help them with their problems ; under other circumstances such women are called " prostitutes " , but here they are known as " surrogates " ) , who becomes a murder suspect when one nosy female reporter who had tried to blackmail her turns up dead . She has two shower scenes and gets in bed with James Brolin - all to keep her fans happy ! But the best shot of the movie belongs to Rochelle Swanson ( who plays the wife of one of Tweed's patients ) : during her one night stand ( literally ) in a dark , rainy alley , she pulls back her partner's head by the hair and gives him a dominating look that is just priceless . ( )
486809	386241	97573	6.0	Not bad .	This is a slick erotic thriller with an interesting plot , lengthy sex scenes that will appeal to both men and women , and a few amusing references to Brian De Palma and Hitchcock's " The Birds " . Although it bogs down a little in the middle , and has some atrocious dialogue , it is still one of Mastorakis ' best efforts ( out of the handful I've seen ) . And it would perhaps be even better if the two main actresses had switched roles , with Shannon Tweed being the mysterious femme fatale instead , and Adrienne Sachs getting the thankless supporting part . ( )
486317	386241	68154	6.0	Better than the first . . . . for what that's worth .	This sequel to " They Call Me Trinity " is a slight improvement on the original ; it has a couple of chuckles here and there ( like Maltin says , the " restaurant scene " is the funniest ) and a LARGE-scale final showdown between the " good guys " ( including some monks ) and the " bad guys " , but still nothing to write home about . Hill and Spencer had obviously perfected their screen personas by that point , but it's a pity nobody sat down to write them a real script ; the story in " Trinity Is Still My Name ! " meanders and tires before long . I would like to say , however , that it may be the best-dubbed movie ever ; no awkward synchronization problems are present , and those who did the voices were obviously enjoying their work . You would SWEAR it was filmed in English ! ( )
486502	386241	66104	7.0	Probably one of Franco's best .	" She Killed In Ecstasy " must be one of Jess Franco's most artistically well-made films ( I say " must be " , because the man has made almost 200 movies , so it's hard to be sure ! ) . Of course , there are scenes that make him come off as a hack ( especially those involving physical violence ) , but at least the film is not boring , and it is helped immeasurably by the mesmerizing presence of Soledad Miranda . She is almost able to convince us that a woman would go to bed with her ten minutes after she had first met her ( ! ) , or that a man would go to bed with her even though he knows she is a killer out to get him ( ! ) ; the story is still implausible , yes , but without her it would've been laughable . She is also able to suggest the rage and sorrow of her character , and indeed one thing that sets this movie apart from other revenge thrillers , such as " I Spit On Your Grave " , is that it doesn't try to justify or celebrate the heroine's vengeance ; instead , it presents an initially normal woman who seems to be getting more deranged by the minute because of her own actions . ( )
486322	386241	118745	7.0	Exhilarating martial arts movie	Although the DVD cover and plot synopsis tries to promote " Bloodmoon " as a serial-killer thriller , that part of the film is the least successful one . It works much better as a " buddy movie " and a martial arts flick . Gary Daniels and Chuck Jeffreys have a surprising amount of chemistry : Jeffreys is obviously the better actor of the two , and perhaps working with him inspired Daniels to work a little on his acting as well . And Darren Shahlavi is truly spectacular as the villain - how can this guy move so fast ? The action choreography in this movie is terrific ; not one fight scene is bad , but the final showdown in particular is about as good as it gets . Do you remember Jackie Chan's fight against that deaf-mute guy at the end of " Police Story 2 " ? That's the level of combat I'm talking about . The Hong Kong influence can be clearly seen in the speed of the fighting , the occasional ( don't worry , it's very occasional ) use of wires , and the crazy , over-the-top stunts . In short , if you're a fan of the genre , " Bloodmoon " is at least worth seeing , if not owning . ( )
485864	386241	95599	7.0	An adequate thriller .	Adequate mystery with lots of twists and turns . . . TOO many twists and turns , perhaps . Like some other mystery movies , this has a convoluted story that seems , after a certain point , to be adding complications for complications ' sake , regardless of how far-fetched they may be . But it's a slick , handsome production , well-acted and fairly erotic , too . ( )
486759	386241	330691	7.0	Riveting thriller - Argento is still a master	For anyone , like me for instance , who thought that Dario Argento's previous movie , " Sleepless " , went overboard with violence , it's nice to see a more restrained Argento where the impact comes not so much from gore as from the suggestion of gore ( though there are a couple of scenes , like the close inspection of dead bodies , that are not for the squeamish , even if you know they're just mannequins ! ) . In fact , apart from not having a great actor like Max Von Sydow in its cast , I found " The Card Player " superior to " Sleepless " in nearly all respects . Argento still knows how to create suspense and play with the audience ; Stefania Rocca is a very capable lead , a REAL WOMAN , instead of some supermodel posing as a cop ; and Liam Cunningham bears a striking resemblance to Jean Reno . I would have given this film an even higher rating , if it weren't for two things : 1 ) The most obvious ( after a point ) suspect turns out to be the killer ; what happened to the good old red herrings ? 2 ) The climax walks a fine line between the suspenseful and the ludicrous , and probably falls to the side of the latter .

487005	386241	206226	7.0	Truly off-the-wall .	I'm not 100 % sure they knew what they were doing when they were making this film , but what they came up with is an offbeat , entertaining mess . Lauren Ambrose is cute and fun in her role ( s ) ; her performance practically makes the movie . The rest of the cast , comprised mostly of unknowns , is also likable and has conviction ( though Busch's transvestite cop is somewhat annoying ) . If you're looking for a mindless and insubstantial film that won't insult your intelligence , " Psycho Beach Party " should fill the bill . ( )
486832	386241	56732	7.0	This film deserves a good re-mastering job .	A brilliantly conceived filmic joke , with an incredibly cynical and ironic ending . Be prepared for a lot of chatter in the first 20 minutes or so ; as soon as the premise starts working and the degeneration of the characters begins , it all becomes more involving . The video version however , as others have already noted , is of pretty poor quality , with a lot of grain and other flaws in the image and a persistent hissing on the sound . ( )
486413	386241	96071	7.0	Entertaining and frightening enough .	At times genuinely frightening thriller , full of hallucinatory andimaginative visuals , strongly supported by good performances , a fine sense of place and an original , intriguing , thought-provoking script . It suffers only from a rather weak - and protracted - finale . ( )
486329	386241	428031	7.0	A stratusfying enough package , but it could have been even better	I expected the main feature to be the weakest part of this DVD and the extras to be the strongest , but it was the other way around . " Trish Revealed " is an entertaining , informative and well-paced hour-long documentary on Trish's life and career up to 2003 . It begins from her childhood , goes to her years in the medical school and her early steps as a fitness model and traces her career in the WWE , from a teasing piece of T & A to a " comic relief " catfighter ( with Stephanie McMahon ) to a legitimate wrestler to an international superstar . It also examines things like her main feuds with her fellow divas and her relationship with her fans . My main complaint about this disc is that it doesn't include enough bonus matches . There are only four , and only three of those are real matches . In detail : 1 ) Mud Match vs . Stacy Keibler ( on Raw ) . OK , this sounds good . It isn't . It lasts about 2 minutes and it's mostly just splashing around in the mud . The women get so covered in it you can't even tell them apart ! 0 2 ) Chicago Street Fight vs . Victoria ( on Raw ) . This also sounds good , but it's much too brief ( about 5 minutes ) . Some solid hits by both women with trash can lids and the like , but the match is not given enough time to develop the intensity it could have . 3 ) Triple Threat Match vs . Victoria vs . Jazz ( for the title , from Wrestlemania XIX ) . Very entertaining , and more of an actual TRIPLE threat than most such matches , but also too brief . Victoria , who was in her " psycho " mode then , steals the show ; her " shoulder tic " is brilliant and her outfit ROCKS . 4 ) Title Match vs . Jazz ( from Insurrextion 2003 ) . This is a mediocre match , but Trish puts in a good performance . Her escape from Jazz's boston crab alone makes it worth watching . In the rest of the extras , the standouts are the " Home Tour " ( wow ! nice home ! ) and the " Diva of the Decade " ( nostalgic clips of older divas - and check out Lita's reaction when HBK announces the winner ! ) . Most of the other stuff ( " Babe of the Year " photo shoots , Summerslam commercial ) is rather trivial ( just for the record , I find Trish's looks a little overrated ; she's not quite as hot as , say , Torrie Wilson ) . And there are some things ( like the " Much Music Awards " segment , with Trish and Chris Jericho opening up two bags full of presents ) that are just a waste of time ( as Jericho himself points out repeatedly in that one ) . All in all , I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD without watching it first , unless you're a very dedicated fan of Trish .
487232	386241	113542	7.0	Uncompromising but flat .	The Australian biopic " Chopper " got all the hype in 2000 , but the much lesser-known " A Journal of Murder " is actually a better film on a similar subject . For one thing , it gives you more of a background about ( if not much more insight into ) the killer , and for another it doesn't try to make him appear " cool " . In fact , the script is quite uncompromising in the way it refuses to humanize Panzram , at least beyond the minimum degree required . But despite Woods ' strong performance and a few nice directorial touches ( especially in the use of black-and-white cinematography and newsreels from the period ) , the film is rather flat - almost like a TV production . ( )
486687	386241	57254	7.0	Great fun !	An engaging mystery with a splendid cast . Nothing phenomenally clever , but still a treat for those who love puzzles and riddles . There are perhaps details that could have been better handled ( like Scott's initial reactions when he discovers that the killer has finally " introduced " himself - not to give anything away , but for a while he seems a bit apathetic ) , but it's hard to complain when you know that this kind of mystery will never be seen again . ( )
487171	386241	55451	7.0	A most unusual Western .	Slow-moving but compelling psychological Western about a determined priest who arrives at a small town that seems to be mysteriously dominated by a local bad guy , and decides to fight him in his own peaceful way ; their confrontations make the movie . Literate script ( just a quote : " Isn't that your job , Father ; To keep hoping that any soul can be saved , even mine ? " , asks the bandit ) , exceptional acting by the two leads ( and very unexceptional acting by Mylene Demongeot ) . ( )
486535	386241	78908	7.0	Don't get her angry !	" The Brood " is easily the best of David Cronenberg's first three movies ( " Shivers " and " Rabid " were the other two ) . That said , it's really nothing special . It does have a fascinating idea to begin with , and some good shocks ( the murder of the schoolteacher especially ) , but I can't help noticing a tendency to over-rate and over-analyze the film simply because it has the name " Cronenberg " attached to it . ( )
485754	386241	25452	7.0	No match for the remake - but there is also no match for Lorre .	From a modern standpoint , it's quite hard to understand why so many people claim to prefer this 1934 thriller to its 1956 remake . It's technically primitive ( as is immediately evident in the opening sequence ) and often clumsy , with one of the weakest climaxes in a Hitchcock film ever ( a totally suspenseless shootout ) . However , there are some brilliant Hitchcockian touches ( the singing in the church , the famous Albert Hall sequence ) , and , above all , there is a delicious , way-ahead-of-its-time performance by Peter Lorre - the one area where the original clearly outshines the remake . Almost every scene featuring Lorre is a highlight of this movie . ( )
486562	386241	249478	7.0	Predictable but well-made thriller .	Predictable ( you know exactly what the last scene will be like right from the start ) , contrived ( the police really should have looked harder for evidence ) , but well-made , extremely well-acted ( especially by Vince Vaughn ) and psychologically accurate ( the " baseball practice " scene was perfectly written and played ) . Might have been better if it had kept us in doubt a little longer about whether the kid is telling the truth or not . Still , the running time of the movie flies by , and that has to count for something , right ? Some have complained about it being " too short " , but surely this is preferable to the opposite , " too long " . ( )
487040	386241	82085	7.0	Satisfying De Palma effort .	An engrossing thriller with a literally chilling climax , a wonderful ( in its variety ) music score and a first-rate performance by John Travolta . Lithgow is also suitably creepy and hateful as a totally ruthless and psychopathic killer . The script is pretty unimpressive ( and if you've watched the film before you may also find it overly simple ) , yet De Palma manages to transform it into a generally satisfying and slick thriller , and the result is more polished , more pleasant for the eyes than his two previous outings , " Dressed to Kill " and " The Fury " . Still , the film's several amazing scenes would have a much stronger impact if the script contained more surprises .
487164	386241	101597	7.0	" It's the suspense , not the pain , that will drive you mad " .	This two-character drama is extremely well-acted and has a valid message and some TRULY shocking moments ( shocking not because they are graphic , but because you're not prepared for them when they come ) . But eventually it does become oppressive , just like the somewhat similar " A Pure Formality " did . Still , Alan Rickman should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance , no doubt about it . ( )
487006	386241	89960	8.0	Moving , sharply observed drama .	What I admired the most about " Vagabond " is the objective , evenhanded approach of the director towards her " heroine " . She neither praises nor condemns her chosen " lifestyle " , she simply observes it - and she observes it so well that this feels like the work of someone who's had first-hand experiences with similar people and surroundings . To be perfectly honest , the film doesn't have much psychological ( or sociological ) depth , and it can get boring at times while you're watching it , but right after it's over , you know that you've seen a good movie . ( )
485691	386241	53125	9.0	Hitchcock at his zenith .	" North by Northwest " is undeniably one of Hitchcock's best movies - not to mention one of my ten personal favorites in general . A brilliant script , full of well-planned twists , Hitchcock's energetic and vivid direction , the constantly clever dialogue , the first-rate production values , an incredible score by Bernard Herrmann ( who pretty much ripped-off himself the following year when he wrote the score for " Psycho " ) and several memorable sequences ( the often neglected auction scene is extremely amusing ) are only some of the ingredients that make this thriller so terrific . I have two minor complaints , though : the film is SLIGHTLY overlong ( maybe it could have been 15 minutes shorter ) and Eva Marie Saint just isn't a particularly attractive woman , compared to Grace Kelly or even to Tippi Hedren , so she is kind of miscast in the role of a " femme fatale " . And her performance isn't in the same class with the delightful ones that Grant and Mason give . But this is still a superb movie , and it is far less dated than the early Bond films , which it probably influenced .
