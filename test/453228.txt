403085	453228	165361	1.0	Something that rhymes with it .	This movie is garbage to be kind . Do not waste your money or time . I thought it was going to be like True Romance by reading the cover but , it turns into this weird Gen x film . They try to make GenX look like 60's children but in reality we are too busy moving from one crappy job to the next . There was no real story . I fast forwarded this movie in spots because it was so bad .
402431	453228	88993	1.0	Starts with and S and ends with a T you can guess what I think about this film ?	Spoiler This film is a grave dissapointment after watching Dawn of the Dead . Lower budget , no script , and unbelievable characters . No one could behave this way a survive . Drunk , rude , very unprofessional army , and un logical doctor , and a 2 dimentional Jamacian character that is written not well . I could not relate with any of the character unlike dawn 78 or 04 . What is with the 80's Miami vice feel to it . Maybe if they had Mike Thomas and D Johnson I would have like it more . Just some gross out effect it the end that did not look believable . Even more unbelievable is how the Zombies got in the bunker . I hate this film . When their is no room in hell the dead will be forced to watch this movie . Rent Isthar it's a better film . At least Isthar is scary even if that was not it's intention . .
402551	453228	81259	1.0	This film is awful	Well , I do not rate too many films a 1 , but this film sure is . I did not like anything about this film . Bad story , and the acting is not as bad as with some of the other Noris movie , but its not that good , and the ending too is awful . Well , its hard to sit through this one . Avoid at all costs .
403346	453228	185937	1.0	bad	Over rated , if you expect a scare this movie will bore you instead . The movie is to bouncy , and will give you a headache . I hope Hollywood will not copy this format and make more cheapo's like this . When I spend 8 . 50 I would like to see a movie that doesn't look like my neighbour made it .
402597	453228	71866	2.0	This film is bad , awful , don't watch	Well , I rented this film with my girl friend , and dad . I thought thisfilm would be cool . This is one of those 70's films , with a socialmessage , like Stegal's on Deadly ground and others . This filmhas a message and no story . What one see's in this film is 1People shooting melons , that has to be a film first . 2 Charlietalking a lot . 3 A bad guy who is one of dumbest in action history , with half the FBI looking for him he stays in the area to huntCharlie . The only good part , was during the gun fight Bronsonsays " Let's get this over with I got work to do " Don't rent , watch onlate night TV , leave this dog alone .
403359	453228	274558	2.0	Unwatchable movies from unreadable books	Unwatchable movies from unreadable books . What worse than watching this movie . I believe I will find out I have to read 3 books about this story for my college English class . Maybe , this is not my type of movie ; the story unravels painfully slow . The story has very little explanation or direction . Focuses on depression with out reason . To dry for me .
402361	453228	90274	2.0	Great acting bad story	Candy and Hanks act well in this stinker , but have no material to work with . Tom plays a rich snob who joins the peacecore to avoid paying some debts . Great idea , but no script to work with . Even John Candy's nerd character can not say this one . Flush this stinker down the toilet .
402509	453228	308383	2.0	This movie is awful	Spoilers ! ! My wife picked this movie , and now I will pick the next one . You will need prozac after watching this depressing tripe . I know this movie has a social message etc , but I believe that gives the producers no excuse to destroy reason . I do not want to be mean to Hopkins , but how can Hopkins play a black man from two black parents . Genetically this is not possible . With this reasoning they could of had Jackie Chan playing Hopkins role . The reverse would be having a black child from two white parents . When this plot twist finally arrived , I said to myself " I don't get it . It's not possible . " Hopkins did play a good self absorbed in love with himself University Prof . I guess the film was trying to say that race made him that way . I think he was just a jerk to begin with being so selfish . It is hard to have any sympathy for this person seeing that he was ashamed of his family and community and wanted nothing to do with them . Usually , people have a sense of comfort with their family or community . If a person runs from one's family , there has be some dysfunctionalism . Nicole Kidman plays white trash to the tee and no one wants to see this . I have to put up with this at work daily . Ed harris plays a wacko . Everyone blames their problems on other people and takes no responsibility for their own actions . Everyone believes that it is okay to behave in a selfish manner . I had no sympathy for any of the characters .
403046	453228	89913	3.0	Burn every copy of this film please	This film is so bad I forgot I saw it before ? My dad rented in in grade 10 and we shut it off . This time it was on the History Channel , and my memory returned . I would rate it lower , but I did not see the second half , my stomach would not allow it .
402834	453228	209958	3.0	boring	This film is boring , I gave it a 3 . The idea of the dream world being entered by another individual to solve some problem , is undoubtably overdone . Nightmare on elm street , Dream scape and I missed a few film here , defines a formula done over and over . This film is sort of a cross between Silences of the lambs meets dreamscape ; which is the strongest attribute of the film . One dream world in a movie is similar to any another . In the end , found this film similar to the movie Dream scape
403305	453228	83722	3.0	Saw this one during horror week on tv .	This dog won't hunt is a saying down south , and I will abbreviate on this saying . This horror movie won't scare . This film is lame more lame than Doug Smail missing on a break away . ( All Jet fans know what I am talking about ) Anyways , this film has about 2 scary moments in it , and the ending is predictable , and disappointing . I would rather watch PBS , than this movie again .
403142	453228	68768	3.0	Boring	I can not sleep through too many of Eastwood's films , but this is one of them . It has him in this 70's anti bad system Western , which has little story , and event less direction . This film has no tension , or acting ; everyone took the money and ran with this film , John Saxon has to be one of the most forgettable b actors every . One can remember the face , but never the name . John does it again with this film . If Joe Kidd got killed early in this film it would have saved me the time of watching it . .
402314	453228	120380	4.0	I did not mind it , but my wife did .	A rip off of Maximum Over Drive , but not that bad . I found the movie entertaining , with a strong ending . My wife hates this film . King writes a story that keeps my attention , and that is key for any good story . I warn the viewer this is a made for TV film . The better half , describes this in one word : Stupid ! Myself , a good b film . Between , our conflicting views this film rates a 3 or .
402424	453228	64665	4.0	Out dated	Spoiler This movie must have been a shock in 69 , but tame by todays standards . I found it predictable , and the characters as did that done that before . I guess the movie has been copied to death . It has the typical late 60 early 70's downer ending . Watch something more happy .
403050	453228	87298	4.0	higher budget	It seems each movie is better than the last , because of higher budgets , better directing , editing , etc . However , this one was one too many . How many times can Jason live . This gets pretty ridiculous . I was hoping Corey Feldman's character gets it but no such luck . The teenagers were nothing but cannon fodder . There was no character development . Save yourself some time and do not rent this one .
402769	453228	122151	4.0	I wish they would let this series die !	Better than the last one , but not that much better . I saw this one as the second of three features at the Drive Inn . A lot of this film is by the numbers . Sappy , PCish , and lame . More like what one would see on some 70's TV cop show . The few moments that make this film better than the last one is Freeway scene , and the beginning with the flame thrower guy . The rest is just rehash . Oh by the way , that Karate guy is quick . Gibson should have ran away from him . I'll give it a PS Joe Peschi does not add any humor too this film , except the cell phone bit with Chris Rock .
403070	453228	118971	4.0	Awful	One actor can act , the other can not . You guess which ! One guy give a performance of 8 and the other a 4 . The script is a 4 and I give this movie a 4 . I never heard a worse southern Florida accent ever . This film ends so stupid . The Devil must of made this film to torment people .
403077	453228	238546	4.0	New Wave and stylish .	This film reminds me of the early 80's New Wave infusion . One can see how Punk evolved into 2 high breds of Heavy Metal and New Wave . This film reminds me of the ' 83 film " The Hunger " with David Bowie . It has the grainy , blue light film quality with most of it being filmed in the dark . The synthesizer music and the character Marius looks like the singer of Human league ; dresses simular to the guy in the video . The cool Lt Cosello ( Miami vice ) acting style is done in true 80's fashion . The concert , with the flames in it , reminded me of Blade Runner . A lot of style , but all vampire films become redundant . I give it an 8 for style , and originality a 4 . If I was younger , say 14 , I would give this an 8 , but as I march into my 30's I give it a 4 or 5 because second time around I seen this before .
403092	453228	114214	4.0	Sucks but not that badly	This film is awful , but has its moment . Stone as a gunfighter , well I don't take this movie too serious . Hackman makes a good villain , and a no name Crowe does an Ok job . Who could have told . I would watch it on TBS .
402340	453228	246578	5.0	This movie is starting to smell ; it's a stinker	Donnie Stinker would be a better title . I know some of the stupid stuff in this movie I heard in the news , but the rest is time space crap . I understand the ending and Donnie Darko is a hero , and I like that . Time lines or fate , can affect ones outcome , and this is what the script is about . .
402721	453228	106918	5.0	Bad awful etc	Spoiler ! ! ! I do not know why so many people like this film . The begainning of this film is great , but the story deteriorates like depleted uranium . The story follows a pattern of unbelievable to more unbelievable , to totally stupid . A few flaws in this story , one would the FBI let it self lose 750 , 000 dollars , two Tom Cruse is not gangland executed , three Gene Hackman show up and tries to pick up Cruse wife for no reason , four Tom's brother can get out of jail for no reason , and five Cruse can walk out of the law firm with evidence for a rico statute , do they not believe in locks . I watched this film again and its still a 5 , Cruse is a great actor who picks alot of average film , no wonder he has not won best actor yet .
403377	453228	76271	5.0	crap , but my kind of crap	Saw it years ago , and then recently on the space network . Watchable , but crap . William Shatner , been in alot of B movie , and is entertaining in this one also . If not for Shatner , this film would be forgotten . Give the guy credit for being the most famous Canadian , considering the scripts he has worked with over the years .
402798	453228	83844	5.0	Another suckie made for TV movie	Spoilers Made for TV movies , unless the movie is cable , is usually low budget , quickly made , lacks imagination , and very formulated . Fires never have smoke , cars always explode when on fire , and people behave very irrationally . I remember watching this film , with my best friend at the time Dwight , and found it interesting for a 13 year old . If anyone , has a vindictive evil sister , this film would make sense . A prank goes bad , as always in these revenge horror film , but this time the , twisted , sister gets here misdirected revenge from beyond the grave . Not bad for TV , but would I watch it again ? No . Except for HBO and Showtime , I barley watch made for TV movies . I guess Denis Weaver could not figure out this murder . How stupid was the younger daughter in this film ? As dumb as one can get for a made for TV movie .
402436	453228	78056	5.0	cheesey	This is one of Slys chesser films , which had both bad a good in it . Here is one for the Stalone fans . The song in this film was actualy sung by Sly , and I think this is the only time he has done it . Lets start with the bad parts in the film . The tied up monkey , and Sly chasing the cockroaches with a bat is a little too much . The song with the bird in the morning was very annoying . I think it is Bella eat your seeds , my wife laughed , but I almost shut it off . It's 1947 right and Stalone is dressed like he's in the 80's , with his ear ring , yeah right . The race for the dollar bill at the beginning , was pretty lame brain . Here is what worked in the film . The wrestling was good , and the part where Sly drives the truck into the bad guy's bar is funny . When Sly is training his brother , and tells him to throw a toilet into the river I just got a kick out of it . Its a bad and good film so I gave it a 5 .
402333	453228	375063	5.0	Another midlife crisis movie !	Another midlife crisis movie ! My buddy Tony bought Sideways for me last Christmas . Another Larry David style movie , without the Larry David bite which David does well in his show Curb your enthusiasm . The movie is a . A few funny spots , and some potential , but the movie becomes impotent like the lead protagonist . The movie is more depressing than funny . However , the makers of Sideways did their home work . The scenes from the Nappa valley are nice and reflect the culture of the area . The details of the characters were well developed . People who make their own problems . Self-absorbed people , who only think about themselves and the results of their behavior is a good theme from the film . Other than that , I would bypass sideways . The movie's title is right . There is no vertical direction here one feels trapped watching this one .
403078	453228	72251	5.0	Dated	Spoiler . I remember this film when I was a little boy . I always loved action thrillers ; films that my mom thought were a little too violent stuck out in my mind . I remember this film along with the 7 ups , and Race with the Devil as a few on my mom's nasty list . I thought they were great , but as I watch them now , they seem so dated and do not age well ! The Japanese and female comments would never be allowed now , but what really got me was how they did it so over the top with the bad behavior of everyone . I work at the post office , and even there with its new lows every year , no one screams and shouts like that . This made it cornballish , and how could they escape so easily , and the idiot who tries to get on the train , and the other idiot screaming during hostage negotiations is just plain stupid . The great part of the film is the performance by Robert Shaw , and Walter Matthau were exceptional considering the script they had to work with . This film is no God Father , or The Sting , so I gave it a five .
402617	453228	80761	5.0	Doesn't age well	Warning spoiler sort of This film probably was exciting , and fresh for its time . I finally rented it because its the original , and sequels most of the time become so watered down , why make them . This film does not age well ; like most action films it follows a formula of building up tension , knife in the head effects etc . Done so many times before , and its a rip off of Halloween , a much better film . It bores the viewer with seen that , done that before approch . Special effects have improved so much in the last twenty year and gore is done a lot better . Decapitation is so common in movies to day , but in 1980 that was probably a shock . We live in the time of exploding bodies and computerization . The film shocked the hell out of every one in 80 , but tame by todays standards , the only real tension starts at the end , with a few twists and scares . I gave it a 5 . 2 at the start 4 in the middle with the typical lets make out theme , and 7 for the ending . The ending gave me a nightmare so thats not to bad , but doesn't save this film . /
402547	453228	95963	5.0	Stale	There has been too many cop films , but I can explain why this one dies . Not a bad film , but it's a copy of Lethal Weapon formula ; of two different types of police partners . It's a did that , done it before type of film . With no surprises , and the typical big ending . It's well directed , and acted , but the story kills this one .
402295	453228	84704	5.0	Badly made movie with a few good scenes .	Not a great movie , but better than other films . The Soldier is about the cold war between the Soviets and Ameriacans . This movie is similar to James Bond but is more violent than the Bond films . Ken Wahl is the C I A's version of James Bond . However , I find the movie is inferiorly made compared to the Bond series . I hate seeing a few good scenes wasted in a film which has choppy directing , an unbelievable script , and bad acting . I like these kind of films but this movie is like a HBO style , low budget film . I wish the makers had more time and money to make this movie the way it should have been made . The Soldier is an 3 or . Watch it on late night TV .
403206	453228	77270	5.0	Disappointing	I found this movie more anti Vietnam war , than what really happened . When I saw this film I expected more of what the war was about , and got satire instead . Platoon with it hollywood story is a much better film , and gave a gritter feel . Rent something else this film is forgettable .
403090	453228	90856	5.0	SCTV never made it on big screen	This film is an example of bad comedy writing , and lame humor . The acting make this film passable , but one can see the jokes coming a mile away . Do something more productive with your time . It's not a stinker , but avoid it .
402902	453228	55928	5.0	Dr No can answer how good this film is .	Here is a few question we can ask about this film . ( Doctor No ) Was it done on a high budget ? No . Did it have the same action sequences as in other Bond films ? No . Is it the best Bond film ? No Thank you Doctor No . This film is the first of all the Bond films it has a different beginning than the other films . There was no Q in this one , or his gagets , along with the dramatic action scenes . This is not a bad first time out considering the low budget in this film ; compare it to 71's diamonds are forever and one will see how the budget grew . You can tell that Ian Fleming loves the islands , and did some spying himself when they made this film . This would have been another b movie if it was not for Sean Connery , whose humor , and sarcasm made this film memorable ; I also liked the Hawaii Five O guys role in the film . A older guy at work told me this was one of the first film where a women was killed in it and that was a shocker for film , but not TV . What can I say this was the first , and if not for Connery it would have been the last .
402516	453228	92890	5.0	Well my wife liked it	My wife love this film , she thinks this relationship movie is great . I found it ok the first time , but second time its more soap operish . They do this big dance at the end of the summer for a bunch of campers , after both lead character live becomes messes big deal . The movie seem hopeless , and pointless . I might be wrong , but this movie will not age well .
402719	453228	112462	5.0	A 5	Not the best of the batman movies , but far form the worst . I noticed they stopped making now , and with out Jack Nicolson they never equal the first . Its a ok story , but a bit boorish . I find the movie predictable , and tired . The comic book hero story wore thin with this film .
402601	453228	82247	5.0	Saw it with my Dad	I saw this film , when I was 12 , with my dad . Not a bad movie , but when I saw it earlier I thought it was good , but my recent viewing of this film I find it cheesy . The beginning is ok , but the rest gets a little unbelievable . My dad read the book , and said this movie is far off from the the truth . In the end , I give it a
403134	453228	211465	5.0	Low low low budget	Except for John , and Vin this would have been another low budget movie in the 99 cent rental bin . John does a great role here , and Vin's plan of beating the toughfest guy in town is the only believable part in this film . However , thoes 2 actors could not save this film . Watch on 99 cent Wednesday at your local video store .
402807	453228	65207	6.0	Rambo before its time	This film has more action in it than a Stalone flick . For a 60's film wow . It has all the World War 2 stuff in it . Nazi's , the warning buzzards , and a castle . Kind of like Wolfenstien the video game . Enertaining film , but not a classic . A bit dated , but stunts , film quality etc gets better with time . Good late night movie !
402621	453228	80120	6.0	Entertaining but I give it a six	This film is entertaining , but lags in parts , and is a bit stupid . The action scenes are incredible , and some of the dialog is entertaining , but there is some boring stretches in this one . The best part in the movie is when Cyres gets shot , he was so annoying ( can you dig it ) I could see the motive behind the shooting . My friend Tony cheered at that scene , anyways this movie is not to be taken seriously it is sorta comic book style . When the subway caught fire and they did not get home I would of called a cab , but then we would have one very boring movie . They got to fight there way back with these comic book dressed type gangs , one of the gangs look like a cross between alternative music Nervana and farmers . The bad guys in this film did a very entertaining job and I was sorta rooting for them . If you like foolish movies ie Repo Man rent this one .
402986	453228	89604	6.0	Rent this one first	Rent this one first or it will ruin part one . This film is where I waste a Saturday drinking beer eating chips and watching this on TBS . Well it will at least relax me . That is what escapism is about . Spoiler Super macho Chuck is a POW of 15 year , or what ever time , and is treated cruelly . The rat in the bag seen is pretty good . Anyways he gets out , and its his turn .
403216	453228	80005	6.0	Good show	I was in grade 4 at the time , but I remember a bit of this show . I used to laugh at it all the time . Kind of like the Rockford Files , with the Angel and Jim mix , but on every show . Show did not last long . I remember the one guy's car taken the abuse all the time . The other guy would con some poor person in thinking , ie Beverly Hills cops style that he was with some organization . Maybe , too ahead of its time . Would like to see it again to see if I grew out of it . Never on reruns . My Uncle and Dad loved the show . I guess it too short of a series to go on re-runs . ABC used to be a good network at one time . At least the low budget reality shows craze has left us . The budgets and quality will rise . Who wants to see someone order golf culbs by the phone . like on The Appentice .
402726	453228	790686	6.0	Good trailer , but a run of the mill movie .	Mirrors has a great trailer . However , the trailer is misleading ! Poor acting combined with poor directing and a bad script makes Mirrors a run of the mill movie . However , the movie is entertaining . I watched the movie for the conclusion and the ending has a big surprise . I hate part of the climax . I will not ruin the climax , but I though you got to be joking with the mirrors exploding . Maybe that is just me . broken mirrors for me . A forgettable movie rental . Go rent Ironman if your looking for entertainment . Not a good year for horror movies . Not many good one out there . More of a action year for movies . Did I write 10 lines yet .
402952	453228	435705	6.0	Not bad , but not good either	Not bad , but not good either , the movie Next is OK . The story maintains the audiences attention . OK acting , and directing , intertwined with a science fiction ( Minority report ) theme of changing future events . Cage's character is hard to catch for his psychic premonitions make anyone pursuing him two or three steps behind . A scare with a twist changing time ending was neat . I will not totally give away the ending . On a lighter side , Jessica looks totally different from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre . I did not know that it was her . I have a premonition Next is a five , no I see a seven . Just wait the movie is a . Good rental .
403034	453228	57115	6.0	Okay to watch	This film is shown all the time on the history station in Canada . It is not a bad movie . It is long , but interesting to watch . The cast was strong . It is a bit dated . It is a true story . I wonder how accurate the movie was to the book .
402523	453228	92099	6.0	Great movie but	This is a great movie , but it lacks something . It was not Tom Cruse's best acting performance , or I did not like Toms character . Well maybe , pilots act this way , but Tom was not a team player , and learned about it ; Val Kilmer was a more liked person , and me with own sin should not cast the first stone because my wife tells me I got a Tom Cruse , top gun attitude so I should not judge . The cast is good you have Michael Ironside , and Tom Skeriet , and the script is good , but not accurate of what happens at top gun , and the story has a moral about growing up along with over coming life obstacles . In the end the jet footage is great , but something just lacked in this film
402426	453228	92225	6.0	crazy but my kind of crazy	Spoiler I was watching this film years back , young and unemployed . This is a hard to accept , especially when other close too you call you a bum . Emlio's character felt like a loser also . This drives him on a cray trial . Unblevable , yet crazy , but likable . I could relate , and becomes a robber hood . Then we find out it's all a dream , which makes a logical conclusion . My wife says hey Mike this is just like you . Very 80's with the FBI guy who understands etc . I like the part where the hero is on the vistors stands in the ending . I won't take this film too seriously , if you don't either ? Killing some time while I down load Black Out game from the Dawn of the Dead movie sight , and thought about reviewing this film . Watch it . . I wonder if they show this one on TBS .
402787	453228	253556	6.0	This is hard one to describe	I'm on holidays and went to this movie yesterday with Dan , and my wife . Dan said this movie is a cross between The Road Warrior , and Dragon Slayer ; you could also add Aliens and Life Force as influential movies from the 80's . This story is very original , and not a copy of the others . Cutting to the chase , and not ruining the film for the first time viewer , I found the film hard to grasp . Maybe , it's the mood I was in , or the film dragging at the beginning . A well made film , I can not pick it apart ; it could be the concept of Dragons flying around that diminishes my view . In the end rent this one .
402801	453228	74875	6.0	Late night TV	Many years back , I was watching TBS late night , and this surprise was on . Do they still have TBS late night ? Not bad for a 70's low budget film ! The film is about bullies and the cycle of violence . How bullies hurt , and the level of violence increases . Others , just replace the bullies as opportunity rises . The comment about todays society is no one would even dare release such a movie in the double 00's , with the crazy high school violence of the past few years . The world was much safer , were such event were in movies . The guy from Death race 2000 brother was in this film , and has appeared in many 70's low budget films . Cheesy story , for a low budget film . Interesting to watch on a late night . I give it a
402528	453228	141926	6.0	Entertaining	This film is ok , and Bill Paxton plays a good role . However , this film steered away from the facts . The explosions were too close , it was the British who actually did this mission , and the story gets a little too unbelievable . There is tension , drama , and a message of what a good leader is . These attributes save an otherwise unbelievable film .
402301	453228	311429	6.0	Different !	Different is the polite word my wife used to describe this movie while we left the theater . Like most people , we went to see the legendary Sean Connery . Sean plays his excellent , action adventure character , but we have too many comic book movies today . Hulk , DareDevil , and Spiderman , and Hollywood is become redundant with seen this done that action sequences , and special effects . Maybe in the 80's and early 90's when Batman came out this film would be more original . Ever notice , ALL these films follow the Bond / Raider formula in their stories . The film was okay but I think one should wait for video .
402563	453228	311113	6.0	I don't know if it is the mood I am in ?	I don't know if it is the mood I am in , but I found the movie average . Good acting and script . Nothing wrong with the sets or production values . No political correctness re-writes of history . The moive has some brutal realism too it . I had a very bad week , before I went into the movie , maybe this add to my bad reflection on it . Sometimes , I love a movie and hate it later on video , just maybe the reverse with this one . It is entertaining , but long .
402487	453228	853785	6.0	Not bad	Not bad , but one of the slower episodes . Character , and plot development is part of this episode . Disastors , trouble , and family problems are a device for character development . The viewer learns Hawken's has trouble being a father . Skeet is developing character and leadership skills . The show give us the primal view of humanity as people struggle for survival . Cooperation and humanity is balance with the brutality of people . Will the town lose it's soul . I hope not . . I think the town is headed for some bad times . I see no sign of God or spirituality in the show . There is a battle for survival . The battle is also of who we are as people .
402428	453228	109635	6.0	watchable	Not a bad movie , the company I was with at the movie wasn't . I found the movie tense . The story is believable , there is some very cold people out there . Help and wit is sometimes needed in life . Moore plays a very mean person , perfectly . Her most believable role to date . The more times they show it on TBS the more times I like it . Sutherland does a good creep also . I wonder if these actors behave this way in real life . The movie is a bit graphic , not for kids . I wonder why Michael Douglas always gets into these bad sex situations . ( Fatal and Basic ) Watch it on TBS . Give it a grade of 70 % I would love to see part 2 . Maybe Moore gets her revenge .
403008	453228	398165	6.0	a second or 3rd movie rental for the night .	a 3rd rental for a movie night . T L Y is a by the numbers comedy , and performs the comedy by the numbers well . Enertaining movie , but no GroundHog Day . Very MTVish , and has a bit of the MTV style message with the film . The viewer will notice a few named actors , and a few named wrestlers , and football players . The Radiers Romanouski is in the film along with Stone Cold Steve Austin , and Kevin Nash . The football is executed well . Better than what the preview shows . A few parts could be cut on the floor . Well directed . Adam Sandler does a decent job , and finally stops doing the weird dumb and dumber humor . ( the weird humor got too much after the 3rd movie ) Very close to the original movie . Do not watch the original first before seeing the remake . Over all I would suggest renting The Longest Yard remake , but with another movie with it .
402586	453228	382992	6.0	Run of the mill summer movie	Run of the mill summer movie . Action , flesh , and romance in a summer movie . The staple of any summer movie . Stealth has Biel and Lucas as leads , and both actors perform well considering the material given . Foxx why did you take that role ? I hope Foxx's answer is money . What worked is the plane look real , and I could see pilot-less planes one day . What did not work . Why would a computer download music ? Answer for the movie soundtrack , in order to sell CD's . Why did the computer go haywire ? The question should have been answered . I like the Alaska and North Korea bit , but a little too Ramboish . . It is an okay movie , save it for a rental on a rainy night .
403114	453228	120915	6.0	Too much like the first and third	Too much like the first and third installments . I liked Jarr Jarr , and the young Obe-One , and the older guy , but the story lacked . The race scene did not get across well on the big screen , but was a good idea on paper . Why did they kill Darth-mall , he was the best character in the film ! They always kill the good bad guys ! I thought Obe cheated in the fight , with that little dirty trick of picking up his saber , and cutting the guy when he is looking down , but I guess he could not beat him any other way . If you watch the film you can see who the Dark Over Lord is , a bit of foreshadowing . I gave it a 6 .
402297	453228	279111	6.0	Drags in spots , but not bad .	This movie drags in spots . The Irish soldier and the cook were dead weight , and Stonewall's wife is another aspect they could do without . Robet Duval plays a minor role , and they should have expanded his . What works with this film is the battle scenes , and Jeff Daniels . I love his Rubecon speech . " We just passed the Rubecon , no turning back . Hail Ceasar , Hail vitory " ; and I sort of hail this film . I hope part 3 is better than the first 2 .
402954	453228	389722	6.0	It was OK	My wife and I went out to see 30 days of night . Monica , my wife , says the movie was OK . It would be awful to have 30 days of nights , and worse to have vampires around , which is the premise of the movie . How could the survivors live if the vampires could smell the human's blood ? Well directed and acted . 30 days is similar to ' the thing , with the gross vampires , gross effects and the winter isolation which give a gloomy feel . The vampires wanted to leave no survivors so people would believe that vampires was just a myth . Hence , the vampires could continue on their feedings . I hate the end , but the end was original . My wife give a 5 , but I give the movie a . Definitely a rental
402696	453228	79858	6.0	Funny in a 70's way	Funny in a 70's way . This film I enjoyed as a kid , but seeing some of it as and adult , the move was too much . I guess as a child I seen movies in a childish way , and as an adult opinions change . There still is a few funny moments , but this movie is dated in a 70's way . I give this one a 5 or .
402963	453228	425061	6.0	I thought Get Smart would be funnier !	I hate Hollywood when they show a trailer with the funniest parts of the movie and that's it . I thought Get Smart would be funnier because of this . Funny in spots , but not like the more funnier scenes where show en in the movie trailer . Not a bad movie , but not a good one either . A movie rental . Soon to be on a pay per view near you . Predictable , by the numbers comedy / action film . I did not mind the movie . Worth watching after a week of work . I wonder if there will be a Get Smart 2 . My wife thinks the film is just OK . My wife also though the show would be funnier because of the TV series . Keep it real everyone . I hate having to write 10 line . I think I have 10 lines now . Ha Ha .
402608	453228	713616	7.0	Kind of like the old movie Scanners	If anyone reading these comments has the TV channel showcase , they you have probably seen the old movie Scanners . Supernatural Nightmare is a mix of Scanners and the movie Carrie . The plot is a mix of what happens to mom and trying to stop a unbalanced person with telekinesis . Supernatural has the usual balance of the two lead protagonists . A blend of the good looking girl , and the realism of the price the protagonist has to live with the sacrifice of dealing with the supernatural . How do they live ? Are they rich as they do not need jobs . Do they get down time ? I hope next season the show answers these questions . ! I wish they just keep showing the show on the same time slot in my area ( Winnipeg ) .
402742	453228	338325	7.0	Dark excellent movie !	For a movie to be good the casting has to be excellent . Baldwin , Sizemore , the British nerd , and Wayne Grow from the movie heat were excellent creeps . The viewer really hates these guys , just like when Bruce Durn shot John Wayne in the back . Baldwin plays the not to bright scum bag as an art form . The plot is simple , and formulated well ; similar to an 80's action revenge or horror movie . Many cameo's in this movie . Bet the farm , that some of the scenes were based on real life . The British guy running in the back yard could have been on the news . The movie gets across the message that paparazzi misinforms the public , and harasses the celebrity . Many want to use the celebrity as a commodity , and thus the reason for security , and the want for privacy . For a good time see it in the theater . I give it a 7 or .
403351	453228	925446	7.0	old school	Not a bad show . When society breaks down the system goes back to bartering . The town has Representatives go down to a trading post in order to get much need supplies . The young kid break a rule , and stealing is punished by dark ages law . The ending is interesting . A few soap opera plot twists . . This episode is a crux in how societal breakdown is effecting America . What is next on the scene . I bet the future is bleak . One of the better shows . The guy from Simon and Simon is a great actor . Watch this one . Reminds me of the Road Warrior . This show keeps it real . Maybe . I cannot wait til February for the next season . Skeet has turned into not a bad actor .
402305	453228	87480	7.0	A good made for TV movie !	Robert Urich was a fine actor , and he makes this TV movie believable . I remember watching this film when I was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich Californian town . Urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and I love the Halloween space suit idea , brilliant . This film is about the battle of one's sprit . TV quality , that exceeds , the big budget , Gangs of New York . I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? I hope so ! 6 or .
403384	453228	284490	7.0	Surprise ! It was funny .	When I saw Eddie Murphy as De Niro's co-star , I thought this movie was going to be awful . I was pleasently surprised . When Eddie Murphy does not produce , director or write his own material , he can be funny . Robert De Niro does comedy very well along with his action and drama movies . William Shatner does a cameo appearance . He has put on the weight . Rent this one , it is rather funny .
403261	453228	305224	7.0	Typical Adam Sandler movie	Adam Sandler does not play the moron in this flick ; that was left up to Jack Nicholson . Humor seems to get crudier every year . If Jack Nicholson was not in this film , it wouldn't of been so funny . Good job on casting . Joe Turtorro plays another weirdo . This seems to be his mainstay . This was worth seeing . It was nice to see a film where there was no social message just outright humor . The theatre was packed and it looked like most enjoyed the movie .
402863	453228	985699	7.0	good movie	The surprise of 2008 , the critics downplayed this movie . Surprisely the movie is much better than the reviews . The only thing that would of made this movie believable is they needed German accents . Cruise was just too American sounding . The part I liked best about the movie is that it gave the viewer the feeling of what it was like to live in a police state . The better movies are always the ones that follow the events closely . Real life movies are always better than fiction . This movie is a 7 or . Worth seeing in the theater . The actor ( Tom Wilkinson ) from Emily Rose is in this movie . He plays the German that plays both sides . A lot of British actors in this film . If the plan would of worked , I wonder if the war would have ended sooner .
402542	453228	119723	7.0	Out off all the books I have had to read for Eng Lit this is the best	Compared to 1984 and other boring tripe this film is entertaining . I like how they show the class structure , how one trys not have norms and standards . My wife thought they were snobs , but after years of working with people who act like the audience on the Jerry Springer show I found this movie quite refreshing . I would like to tell Mrs Dalloway life is not that bad , and for her friend to get over her . You tried to make her a person she is not . When you do that you end up with a unhappy life .
402470	453228	77269	7.0	Depends on what mood I'm in if it's a 6 or 7 .	Peck's best performance ! Making the natives on his little island have blue eyes , and strangling his buddy at the ball was a chilling performance . Mad , and extreme made his character believable ! I remember seeing this film with my dad when I was 9 ; In Winnipeg we have the Walker theater , they showed this movie back then , it had a balcony , and those little VIP balcony seats on the sides . I will never forget that day the film and theater just sticks in my memory . Before I degress any farther , I find the film either drags , or intrigues me depending on my mood . The ending with the dogs I will never forget . I wonder if anyone remembers a SCTV Cooking with Croft skit based off this film ? ( With Joe Flaretty being Peck " That's better isn't it ! " ) Worth renting .
402780	453228	329575	7.0	Believe the hype	For once a film lives up to the hype . I found this story interesting , and believable . True stories grab my attention more than the made up ones . I wonder how close the movie is too the facts , considering time restraints , and drama . I never wanted to see this , but we borrowed the DVD from my sister and I was glued to the TV . It even has a not too dragged out social message . The actors look the part . All the horse race action is done well . This movie reminds me of going to the track with my dad . Sometimes you have to take chances in life ! In the end , I guess we must all keep moving on like the Seabiscuit in life . 7 or
402490	453228	833360	7.0	Not bad	An interesting episode . The show informs one about what to do with fall out . The questions lingers about Hawkens why does he know so much ? I wonder if they could get all the food clean ? How could one hunt for the deer would eat something radioactive ? The show follows the formula of problem , and how to solve it . The soap opera part where the affairs , and relationship problem continue . I love the idea of isolation and the fear of it ? People become panicky , and delusional . The mayor is right about how to maintain control , and diverting people from going into chaos . . One of the better episodes . I wonder how many bomb did go off ? Where is the army ?
402384	453228	482599	7.0	I like this movie !	I like this movie . The photo imaging subplot is great . One notices the grainy quality which foreshadows a oncoming storm . The lighting is always dark , which gave me a feeling of dread which adds to the script . Always signs of sexual tension with the fashion industry characters . The three elements create a perfect storm of a women scorn . All 3 males act as if they have a wild secret . When the storm hits by the vengeful spirit the story theme about what comes around does go around is revealed . I like the surprise ending when obsession never ends and a broken heart begins . Be careful what one does there is always human feelings . A good mystery . A good date night movie . My friend Dax though run of the mill , but I like the story .
403080	453228	92675	7.0	Jean Claude Van Damme's first starring role	If you like Karate , you will love this . I like the fight scenes , and the bad guy in the film is always a bad guy in Karate movies . ( ie Enter The Dragon ) It is a bit sloppy in spots , but considering the budget you can not hit this film too hard . It is a good film to see if your mad or angry at someone .
402461	453228	172495	7.0	A solid 7	This is a good movie , not a great movie . Better to see on the big screen , and it is worth the 8 . 50 I paid for . I am a follower of history , and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or hollywood or politically correct film , in order to have a believable script . It did , the story was a little hollywood , but gave a good description of the brutality , and views of the time . I will not spoil the story , but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play , with revenge being the main motivator in the story line . This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time , and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy . A good epic . The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic , and the action is done with perfection . It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day , because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film . The film wasn't too long either , and that is good considering how long it was . I gave it a 7 maybe , because it didn't grab me , but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more .
402712	453228	88170	7.0	Best Trek in the series	This film is the best in the series . It has 3 good plots melding together . Kirks relationship with Spock , along with Kirks hatred for the Klingons , and mystery of what will happen to on that planet . Christopher Loyd plays the best Klingon in any movie , and Shatner has the TJ Hooker look . Who can ask for more ! One can see why Kirk became a Maverick from this film ! 7 or .
402809	453228	88128	7.0	Very 80's	This movie entered the theatres two years after it was made . The hair styles , clothes , and attitudes were very 80's . Farmer Ted was extremely funny ; I loved how he danced . The actor who played the rich jock did it perfectly . The Chinese student was hilarious . It is nice to see good people actually get things there way . The world is far from this .
403108	453228	112573	7.0	Good epic	This film is a good epic , but not great , as many believe . It is entertaining , and has outstanding acting . The only weak link is the length , which bogs down the film . A good scrip , but they could cut 20 minutes out of this film . Mel Gibson , will be remembered as a great actor . I believe he has yet to perform his best work , and will act in many more successful roles . ( he knows a stinker script when he see it , and his acting gets better with age ) I would rent this film , but hesitate to buy it .
403177	453228	415306	7.0	a alright movie	The preview make the movie look too stupid . I thought the movie would be another Anchorman . A movie can be too much Will Ferel , like the Anchorman . This movie had a right mix , and the humor is spread out evenly . I did not like the comments on J C , for years of Catholic school I would be careful on such humor . Too much adverting in the movie . One restaurant chain is mention at least 5 time . I like the chain . Turn your brain off the movie is OK . . If you miss it that is OK rent it . I like how the south has no problem joking about itself . Humor is hard to do ! Ferel keeps getting better with time . I can see Ferel doing a few old Bill Murry roles . I like the I am on fire bit . The video game part is good . A bad summer for movies .
403251	453228	431197	8.0		Ever gone to a movie with low expectations ? I went to ' The Kingdom ' with low expectations and ended up seeing one good movie . The story is interesting to follow . The directing and acting keeps a good pace , while the character development draws the audience in . Terrorism impact on people , and the hardships of rooting terror out is evident with ' The Kingdom ' . Great locations , and interesting interactions in the middle east give ' the kingdom ' a different view of the FBI . . A violent ending , gives closure , or full circle for the movie's violent beginning . Worth leaving the house for . Chris Cooper always seems to play the same roles .
402605	453228	713610	8.0	Watched it yesterday	I just watched the show yesterday . I remember a horror movie with a similar plot on TBS a while back . The film was Creepy , gross , with the evil doctor who causes rage to go wild . The accident at the beginning is the formula for the plot . One learns about the Winchester brothers ' conflict with the psychiatry twist . Dean is the domineering , and non-emotional one who conflicts with his brother . In the wrong light , such a attitude can be mistaken for being arrogant and cold . The pace and the story is well timed . The camera work and special effects are visually frightening . . What is the deal about their dad at the ending ? I like the good guy / bad guy role where one pretends to be a nosy reporter and the other brother saves the cop from having deal answer the nosy brother's questions . The good guy then gets all the details as the cop is more willing to share the asylum's history with him .
402679	453228	97351	8.0	Costner's high water mark	Before Costner tried to please the critics , he made some challenging films . This film is his best . A 60 homerun season , if he ever bests this that would be incredible . Fantasy / Science Fiction film that is believable . What if the ghosts from the past appeared in a corn field , made into a baseball diamond . Wrongs could be corrected , people could do what they love baseball , and redemption could be found . I will not ruin this story for you , but it is a strange one . So strange that it works . Original , creative , and most of all entertaining . Rent this one , way better than the other crop movie Signs . A classic !
402996	453228	1222615	8.0	Funny Funny Funny	Funny ! Funny ! Funny ! The fourth season of Supernatural uses humor way more than the first three seasons . I love the super strong kid scene . The Teddy bear scene is great too . The wishes end up being bad wishes . The sad part of the show is the geek's life is better off with the bad wish going wrong , but hey when you hit bottom there is no where to go but up . I like the message be careful what you wish for you might get it . The story's message of having everything you want drives you crazy is told excellently by Dean . Dean says he has his problems too . I agree . Well the Impelia make a great guest appearance and hits someone . Wishful Thinking is a .
403215	453228	371606	8.0	worth a few laughs	Worth a few laughs . My wife saw the preview , and thought it was cute , and wanted to see it ! She did not recognized any of the voices . The story is both interesting for both kids and adults . A lot of stupid behavior . The story has the same formula as the cry wolf story . No one believed him . The aliens remind me of the War of the worlds with the three legs and laser lights . The paper pants and a few other props were funny , a lot of imagination with the movie . The movie remake was interesting at the ending too . Patric Stewart from Star Trek does the teachers voice . . Good Christmass movie . Take kids or the girl friend .
402884	453228	80684	8.0	Still good	I remember going to this film with my older sister at the Garrick downtown , which by the way they closed yesterday . We arrived at 11 am , figuring we would be the first in line , to our surprise we met this guy Andy Swan , who was there from 9 am on . He was waiting in line from about 8 am on for his friends , I got to be number 11 in line for this film on the first day . The line up was over 3 streets , and there were people with Darth Vader Masks , Light Sabers , etc . It was more like going to an Oakland Raider game , than a movie . The wait , and the build up did not disappoint the viewer . This film was original , and not a copy of the first . A plot that left the viewer hanging , and some great special effects . I love the Yodi guy . Not as spell binding as the first , but in someways better .
402972	453228	265086	8.0	Realistic	This movie is a factually based , and done in a way of a real life documentary . My friend Tony told me about the book , and its pretty close to the movie . There is a mention ( very lightly ) about not having heavy armor , from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN , and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls , he would have lost the election if it was called right away . I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again , when they called for the US to help out a country , and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out . This movie shows why . It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war / horror movie . We see what army life is about , how well trained the special forces are , and the confusion , and horror of war . The film is one constant feel of fear . It was accurate , but according to Tony left some of the grimmer parts out . Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names , a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields , and spotters . You really feel bad for the men , and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive .
402885	453228	80487	8.0	Funny	I like this film , and it ages well . I don't know anyone who did not like this film ; 6 . 9 ranking that's got to be wrong . This movie had the perfect cast , everyone was not at their hight of fame yet , and if this film was done a few years later they could never afford the budget . Ted Knight is highly unrated in this film , because of the other stars , but watch him closely and see the comic tension he creates . Give this movie a chance .
403247	453228	498399	8.0	Another good movie with a 70's feel	Another good movie with a 70's feel . If any of the IMDb readers reading my critique watch late night movies , like myself , they will notice a 7ups or Marathon man gritty 70's style to ' We own the night ' . A strong drama about family , tradition , crime , and the interaction of individuals in society . Great script , excellently executed by the powerful cast of Phoenix , Wahlberg , and Duvell . The near ending part with smoking the bad guy out is powerful . The full circle of who we are is brought out with Phoenix's character development . The real Phoenix is a cop , not the Phoenix of the club whose friends are the ones who betray him . There are the themes of honesty over deception and compassion over selfishness ! The prodigal son has returned . . Run don't walk to see ' We own the night .
402347	453228	90180	8.0	Strong film	This story is very 80's , and is heavily influenced by the TV show Miami Vice . The style , clothes , music , and characters reflect that time period exactly . The direction of this film gives a slick feel ; where its action , style , and seedy underside all blend in well . The story could be very predictable , but with its plots twists , and the theme that follows the saying be careful when you go hunting for monster not to become one yourself gives it originality . It has some mind blowing stunts that create tension , and if you watch the film Ronin you see where they got the car chase idea from . In all this film gives a feeling of being involved in events that go too fast , too dangerous , and too twisted . Its shows what happens to the heart when the individual becomes obsessed with what he seeks . Watch this one and love it .
402380	453228	1206073	8.0	Good show	I like this show . Started slow , but the episode picked up as the show progressed . I wonder if the slow start was the directors intention ? Phone calls from the dead cause people to die . Dean hears form what could be his father ? Can Dean's dad be real ? Sam is the realist for a change of character while Dean is not . A major story change for the series ! The plot twist at the end is great . I never would have guest . The part where people have more communication , but less community is so true . We live in such a society where people try to grab hope through new technology . for the show . I wish season 3 could have been longer .
403281	453228	814022	8.0	I liked it	I loved this movie . I found Bangkok Dangerous well directed , acted , and executed . The pace and flow of the movie keeps the viewer enthralled with the characters and story . Cage's character has highs and lows where the character , Joe , deals with fast paced action , melded with slow paced personal character development created by his interaction with other characters . The movie gives the viewer a breather between the intenseness of the movie's action . The supporting actors with Cage create a realism of the dangers of Bangkok . I found the movie pays homage to the 1973 classic ' The Mechanic ' . The other homage the movie pays is to the 1973 Bond film ' Man with the Golden Gun ' A great movie to watch . I have notice the trend of cross social interchange in movies lately . Where one sees the mix of North American and Asian language and culture in movies like " The Ring " etc . I find the change refreshing where one sees something new in films . Other than the same old same old . 8 gunfights out of 10 for Bangkok Dangerous .
402637	453228	269347	8.0	Wrong Wrong Wrong you all got it wrong and missed the message .	Spoilers ! ! ! ! ! Excellent film , it has its flaws , but I understood the message . The movie starts out without all the stupid credits at the beginning , but with a Johnny Cash Bible verse , with a few changes , because it is from the killers mind . Del Toro wants to die and as in the Bible when God tested Abraham about sacrificing his only son , Del toro wants to die and views Jones , as a father , and his actions calls Jones out . The movie starts in with a violent Kosvo operation , and this shows his battle stress , and what made him mentally ill . He explains this illness with his nonsense about so many chickens get slaughtered a year ; meaning that his hunting skill has evolved him higher on the food chain , and he is acting out nature's plan , and Jones is the only one higher in this chain . The message in this film not about violence , but what it does too men's souls . Which is evident with Jones at the ending .
403176	453228	469641	8.0	surprise of the summer	Surprise of the summer ! W T C shows the worst which happened bestowed by the enemies of America , while Americans show the best of humanity with the attack . A long movie , which did not drag . The story unfolds on several fronts . The coming together of America , and the human side . I believe the film is a dedication for all the heroes of that tragic day . A few questions the film never answered . Why did the gun fire by itself ? Why was there a flame ball underground ? Cage's character was right that the elevator shaft is the strongest part of the building to hide under . . I wonder if there will be any spin off movies about the wars we presently face . Was there a ex-marine character that actually presently himself to help find survivors ? If so , Kudos to him .
402929	453228	455857	8.0	4 . 2 What ? More like 7 or 8 !	4 . 2 What ? What is with a 4 . 2 ? Too hard on the film . The movie is not a Scream type film . I was surprised . The movie makers did a film in a way that could actually happen . I like the concept ! Not a fantasy Scream style film . A nice break in the horror movie filming . The over the top stunts , and blood is replaced with the sick mind and tension of a predator . A slow burn . The story has many little extras . I would watch the movie again . I guess the urban legend has killed the plot twists . If one does not know the story the better the film will unravel . The Colorado back drop is lovely but spooky at the same time . The woods and the cabin feel of the house give a wild and unsafe what is in the woods lurking atmosphere . 7 or . Worth cheap night . A Friday night date movie . I would buy the movie for 9 . 99 at Wal-Mart .
403304	453228	56197	8.0	Better than Saving Private Ryan !	Last time I watch this one is the day my Grandfather died , to take my mind off it . I forgot how well acted , directed , this film is , and what a huge budget . This shows is an acting documentary , and cuts out the crap . We did this all for nothing is a great line . Check out the line up for this movie WoW ! I do not tell many people to rent an older black and white film , but even with out color it is better than most .
402582	453228	940441	9.0	This show had me guessing	I love watching a story unfold where the viewer is guessing the next plot twist . The anticipation for the conclusion was unbearable ! This show is well directed , and acted . The supporting cast was superb . The gas station scene with the clerk was excellent , and Dean's solution of bribery was great . Sam gets a break from being the good guy and plays an evil character . The character twist adds new life to the show . Who was doing the killing ? Would Dean kill Sam ? The smart guy in the junkyard who solved the problem wraps up the story nicely . . A fresh new episode . Can hardly wait to buy the second season on DVD which is set to come out on September 11 , 2007 .
403278	453228	1222611	9.0	One of the better episodes !	In The beginning is a great episode . The story of how Sam is who he is becomes known . The Back to the Future story line has Dean going back to 1973 and meeting his parents . Dean finds a soft easy going father instead of the harden marine . I believe John Winchesters harden life , the bad event with his wife made John the man he was latter on in life . The Impelia plot twist is great . Dean finds out his mom was a hunter wow . Dean learns one can not change time . We have an eerie warning were Dean understands the past so he can change the future . What about Sam ? for this episode . Worth watching ? What will Dean do ? Why does Dean always have to clean up the messes ?
402482	453228	326905	9.0	Rangers all the way !	If you like watching the history channel like I do you ' The Great Raid ' is the summer movie for you . Not a flaw in The great raid . Directed and acted well . The script follows the historical and personal stories well . Movie is better than Pearl Harbor . The acting schools are better than years ago , and shows that no film needs a 9 million dollar actor which kills the budget , with cheap sets , and no script rewrite . Many years ago the need for name actors helped . Some of the no name actors do better films and acting , while the Julia Roberts , and Tom Cruises live on past glories and have been in disappointing films , with tired roles . Nice to not see all the computer animation in a film for a change , which is getting old . 9 or . Nice to see a film which tells the story like it is . Not have all the Hollywood made up baloney . I rather watch the Duke if the film is fictitious . Good movie
402921	453228	1032130	9.0	WoW great episode .	Wow great episode ! ' Dream a little Dream of me ' is a cross between the 1980's classic horror movies ' Dreamscape ' , ' A Nightmare on Elm street ' and ' Altered States . Dean and Bobby face personal demons , and a crazy dream killer like Freddy Kruger , but more like the villain from ' Dreamscape ' . Sam figures out the solution , just like in the movie Dreamscape . Well written , the script is a great homage of horror movies past . Excellent acting , and many subplots for future shows . I wonder if Bella pulls her evil stunts to get Dean's attention . Bad attention is better than no attention at all . . Still the best show on TV . Funny , in a strange way , how the other network pits the macho show ' Jericho ' in the same time frame against ' Supernatural ' . Supernatural will win . I wonder if they will ever pay homage to the Canadian horror classic ' Scanners ' ?
403023	453228	66206	10.0	excellent	A must see for any war movie buff . Few , movies have some one who actually knew the man the story was written about ; this movie protrayed Patton excellently because of this . The battles and portrayal of the Germans is also done perfectly .
403115	453228	1000536	10.0	I love this one	Dean Winchester is funny . Sam and Dean go to prison . Dean fits in too well and Sam say do you see a problem with fitting in so well ? Dean say no in very well adjusted manner . If one watches the show they see the humor of Sam and Dean's banter . The film quality , acting , and supporting actors make this show above average . The director's vision of cons and sets is great for the adage and ambiance of Folson prison blues . The old mind your own business con is great with his helpful but not too helpful attitude . Folson prison blues ends excellently , and the special effect are movie quality . . Catch the re-run this Summer !
402335	453228	145487	10.0	This one is a winner !	This is the best comic character since Batman . In fact , I liked this a lot better than Batman . It did not have any slow spots . The acting was well and the characters fitted the comic book characters to a tee . I can not wait for the sequel . I wonder who the villain will be . The special affects were good , but you could tell some was computer graphics . A must see .
