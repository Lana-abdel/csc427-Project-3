403085	453228	165361	1.0	Something that rhymes with it .	This movie is garbage to be kind . Do not waste your money or time . I thought it was going to be like True Romance by reading the cover but , it turns into this weird Gen x film . They try to make GenX look like 60's children but in reality we are too busy moving from one crappy job to the next . There was no real story . I fast forwarded this movie in spots because it was so bad .
403346	453228	185937	1.0	bad	Over rated , if you expect a scare this movie will bore you instead . The movie is to bouncy , and will give you a headache . I hope Hollywood will not copy this format and make more cheapo's like this . When I spend 8 . 50 I would like to see a movie that doesn't look like my neighbour made it .
402597	453228	71866	2.0	This film is bad , awful , don't watch	Well , I rented this film with my girl friend , and dad . I thought thisfilm would be cool . This is one of those 70's films , with a socialmessage , like Stegal's on Deadly ground and others . This filmhas a message and no story . What one see's in this film is 1People shooting melons , that has to be a film first . 2 Charlietalking a lot . 3 A bad guy who is one of dumbest in action history , with half the FBI looking for him he stays in the area to huntCharlie . The only good part , was during the gun fight Bronsonsays " Let's get this over with I got work to do " Don't rent , watch onlate night TV , leave this dog alone .
403359	453228	274558	2.0	Unwatchable movies from unreadable books	Unwatchable movies from unreadable books . What worse than watching this movie . I believe I will find out I have to read 3 books about this story for my college English class . Maybe , this is not my type of movie ; the story unravels painfully slow . The story has very little explanation or direction . Focuses on depression with out reason . To dry for me .
402403	453228	107254	2.0	If you watch this film where the title doesn't sound cheese ball enough you deserve to endure this turkey	The only reason I did not give this film a 1 , is the beginning . After that , this film is bad as the title sounds . Out of desperation for entertainment I rented this one , believing the last sequel was the true ending . Minus the stupid story which drags this series on like Jason himself who just does not die there is many other weak points . What bothers me more is the low , low , production budget . I know the other films were done on low budgets , but todays low budget films look like I filmed it with my dad's camcorder . Over bright , video looking etc . Over acting , and extra plot twists make this film look like a low budget Show Case original ( that is a low budget Canadian cable channel ) . Awful computer animated special effects , could they get any more phony . The little creature running around described in one word cheap . The music is identical to Show Case's . This film barley rates a . Die Jason . . . Please just die !
402794	453228	280707	2.0	7 . 7 what is wrong with you voters !	My wife picked this one ! Boring , more boring , and even more boring describes this dog of a film . Why most the scenes where even shot is a mystery as they added nothing to the story . It shows one the different class structure which still exists today . I am glad I did not waste my money and see it in the theatre . The previews were deceiving ; it made it look like the game clue . I thought from the previews it would of been more exciting . I was sure wrong . Avoid this one at all costs .
402511	453228	315824	2.0	Little bounce if any !	The Big Bounce , has little bounce if any at all ! All right , more like a big thud . Lame , and a bit more . Ok , extremely lame . This movie has this barter between Owen Wilson , and the lead lady . There is no spark or Jame Garnerism in the film . The story gets across as a cheesie 1970's film where everyone runs around , gets upset , and the plot twist conclusion is a thud , instead of a bounce . Owen Wilson bounced out this film with the money and never looked back . The producers bounced a bunch of big names , and give the viewer very little to watch . I bounced this movie quickly back to the Video store . This movie bounced out of the theater quickly . I give this movie 2 bounces out of 10 .
402992	453228	102045	2.0	This movie is bad don't rent it .	Chuck was losing it when he made this one . Flimed in Canada , and on a low budget with out a story , I ended up disliking this one . I like action films and found it hard to sit through this one . It had Al Waxman from CBCs King of what ever , and Bruno form the Beach Comers . Any over the age of 30 from Canada know this to be a bad cast . All they needed was Mollys reach . Sorta Spoiler ! At least Bruno gets kill , but that does not save this film .
402322	453228	203019	2.0	Sappy	I gave this film a 2 , and I watched about half of this sappy film . The Rocky who over comes great obstacles films ie Mask , Karate Kid , and the Jessie Owens story , have been done over and over to the point of over kill . Like action films which have the reputation of seen it , did it , done it before approach , this film has the originality of Rambo 6 . Maybe , the movie industry should go back to 1970's ending where everyone dies , or things don't work out , for a change . I love plot twists or a memorable scene I have never witness before , but to do a film where I can predict to the last detail what will happen next is boring . Maybe , thats why people cheer for the bad guys in wrestling now because of the sake of change , the Hulk Hogans , with their white hats on , is a event of the 80's . Like heavy metal , and Rambo this film belongs in the 1980's .
403093	453228	114857	2.0	This movie is so bad you know not to watch it !	This movie is so bad you know not to watch it , and my wife rented it not me . After Sunday dinner , at my mothers . my dad and I watched it . I could not believe that someone said Washington should have won an award for this film . A stupid story , how could this guy come to life ; this is like the Holldeck in Star Treck . Why did they keep using such a dangerious device . The best part of the movie was the credits . I though it would never end .
403314	453228	91828	3.0	This film helped kill action movies	In 86 , Cobra came out , and many claim that this movie was the end of action films ! Wrong , Raw deal was ! Bad script , acting , and an ending that looks like a made for TV film make this a stinker . By the end you wish they killed Arnold . Good thing he did not say " I'll be back " for a sequel to this film .
402806	453228	62824	3.0	Saw it on TBS	This movie is Mc Cloud before the TV show aired . I remember Mc Cloud when I was a little boy , and saw this movie last year on TBS , and bingo this is where they got the idea from . Not one of Eastwoods better films , on that how many hours of Eastwood , where they show all his movies . He does beat up the dad from " Happy Days " in this movie . Either a movie with age gets better like wine , or turns into vinegar . This one turns into vinegar
402697	453228	87032	3.0	I thought the Cannonball Run was awful !	You think one would learn , after the first film . A lot of people got sucked into watching the first one , and it did have a good trailer . This time my friend Dwight rented part 2 , when I went with my parents to his house , we watched this one in the basement and I thought maybe it could be better than the first . I few good car chase scenes , but this one is a real over the top film . Too , over the top , it is like one of those Jim Carey films . If Jim Carey was around they would have him in the cast too . I give this one a 3 or .
403153	453228	99871	3.0	Bad Bad Bad	Warning spoiler This movie is one where you love or hate it , and I hate this one . My wife considers this film " one of the most stupidest films I ever seen " . We remember it , because it was our third date in collage , and after the film we decided to start going out together as a couple . This movie moves back and forth from Tim Robbens life as different people , which is haunted by these demons . We find at the end the struggle is in his mind , and the tricks the minds plays when one is dieing . Except for a scene where this head shakes at this party , I jumped out of my seat to my girlfriends delight , this film pack very little punch .
402919	453228	319931	3.0	I can only watch this show for about 3 minutes .	I can only watch this show for about 3 minutes . I remember , back in the day , going to battle of the bands , and what I am watch is a televising version of the latter . I must be getting old say back in the day . The entertainment is similar to the bar bands grade B . OK but I can not watch a full hour of the show . Another rendition of Star Search ! There is some humor in the show ; and people love to watch others bomb or go down in flames . I believe we love to watch people burn for it makes us not feel so bad about ourselves . When others stink we feel good knowing we could do better or the same . I just find the show too much hype . Simon could use a chill pill . Simon . Simon what are you doing ? I guess Simon must know people for Simon's made a lot of money of Idol .
403087	453228	86312	3.0	gag me a bag , run from your tv !	This film is awful , the film portrays the women with so many issues , you wonder how balanced she was . Sort of discredits the story , I wish they just went with the part at work , and stayed away from her personal life . My rating on this film is gag me a bag , run from your tv ! This film is like videodrome it will give you hallucinations .
403301	453228	63035	4.0	I love the song , but one of the Duke's weaker movies !	When my dad rented a VCR , back in 84 he picked out a couple of movies ( 82 ) The Thing , Officer and a Gentalmen , and this one . I remember him marching around with a canoe paddle to the song , and the Family laughed . John Wayne had a lot of resolve to make this movie against the media left . 68 a lot people probably screamed about this movie , and John tried to support troops who had a hard time when they got home to some unfair critism . This film shows the cruelty of the VC , which is left out of alot of other Vietnam film , however this film is bad . The pace , acting , and even action scenes apear dated , and awkward . In fact the whole film is awkward . I love action movies and this one drags and is slow . The chopper scene is legendary in bad special effects . In conclusion this is not a extremly bad film , but bad .
402394	453228	63442	4.0	Over rated !	I expected much more from this film , after hearing all the hype . Ilike science fiction , I never thouht Rod Cerling was that good of aSci fie writer . Maybe , it is the age of the film and it does not shocktoday , but in the end I felt dispointed . Heston plays a good role , and its funny how for bush human's Heston ends up with a veryclean , well dressed , done up female one . Don't bother
402765	453228	92272	4.0	A sport I love	Another awful movie about hockey . I if never watched hockey and saw Hollywoods version , I would hate the game . This movie doesn't make Canada look that great either . I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously . All the same this movie is awful , with every thing you can put in a 80's movie . In the end don't even watch it on TV .
403258	453228	78908	4.0	Stupid	Ever see a horror movie and say stupid ? Well this one is . It was on Show Case ( In Canada ) A forgettable movie , don't waste your time . A typical low budget late 70's early 80's Canadian movie . When the government was giving out grants . Many horror movies around this time where awful cheap , bad acting etc . Reminds me of that movie with the water tank I can not remember the name , but also is stupid . Do something better with your time like hang around the paring lot , and miss this one
402631	453228	101764	4.0	yuk	Well , it was funny in spots . This film is a 4 or maybe a 3 . Its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust . Rent this one after you seen everything else . Beats boredom , but not by that much . My wife like like this film better then I do , maybe its not that bad .
402704	453228	70915	4.0	Gator before Gator .	This film must have done well in the box office , in order to give Gator the budget it deserves . This film had no budget , needed a script rewrite , and a better ending . There is flashes of brilliance in this movie . The boat ride scene , Burt driving the mean machine , and his chat with his parents . You can tell Burt is a Southerner , and not a actor . This movie shows what Gator would be like , Burt's best film . Too , bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the Rush .
403320	453228	103644	4.0	This film kills the other 2	What is worst than Alien 3 is Alien 4 , they ran with the money on this one ; by using the name of a successful film series they suckered people into rent this one . Low budget , but directed well considering the poor script , this film should be on late night at least it can compete with the infomericals .
403060	453228	70672	4.0	Lame film	My mom would not let me watch this film when I was in grade 2 , because she said it was too violent . Well , years later , and the only reason I remember this film is because of my mom , I stayed up and watch it on PBS . Well , maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film , but I found it lame . It did not age well , and this made the acting choppy , huge unbelievable holes in the script , but there is a few cool scenes like car chases , and a big gun fight . I will not stay up for this film again .
402494	453228	891527	5.0	Misleading	I hate misleading previews . The movie shows Tom Cruise in a major role , while he performs in a minor role . My wife and I were disappointed . The irony of ' Lions for Lambs ' message about the political right misleading the public is hypocritical when I spend 8 dollars for a preview of a Tom Cruise movie , which the film is not . Shame ! Shame on the people who packaged ' Lions for Lambs ' . Directed and acted OK . The message has a few accurate points , of inactivity , and mistakes made , which is part of life . However , the films easily blames other while never coming up with any solutions . A real bummer of a way to convey a message . Just makes people feel good too complain , but maybe the film was saying answers are in all of us . I relate more with the disillusioned student . I am like this guy . The I did not inhale answer of politics , and people buying it or not goes along with whose political beliefs one believes is why the kid is the way he is . I like the Redford prof for who cares for his students more than teaching for himself . I wish there were more profs as portrayed in this film . 5 out 10 .
403132	453228	312700	5.0	better than half past dead	This is a direct to video film . I do not recall this one being released in the theatres . I found this movie better than half past dead . It looks like he lost weight for this one . The location shoots where not bad . I like the European feel . It is no Ronin though .
402943	453228	375210	5.0	Not worth watching	I hate when a movies trailer is better than the actual movie ! Watching the trailer gave a misleading idea of the movie . The acting , directing is OK . The story ? Why would anyone watch static all the time . Enough with the static , and who could interpit the static . I found the static theme hard to understand , and unreasonable force in order drive the plot . The movie is all build up with no ending . One expect a scary event , which never happens . What a let down for an ending . That is the best the writers could come up with ! I felt like yelling rip off in front of everyone . I wonder if the makers did not know what to do with the ending . Build up with no actual scare . I would call this movie a tease . This film makes false promise , and can not deliver a decent ending . Two thumbs down . . Do not even rent this one . A 4 . 99 DVD at Wall Mart in two years .
403357	453228	100519	5.0	Have to take Hamlet to understand this film .	# 3 of the films I have to watch for English litature . Confusing for my wife who never studied Hamlet , and the movie jogged my memory . One would miss some of the jokes if one never read Hamlet . The probability joke was funny at the beginning , and other parts leading to the middle were excellent . The movie bogs down in the middle , and reaches it's predestine conclusion . out of if you never read Hamlet and out of if you read Hamlet . I personal find I can get more out of 2 hour movie than 2 weeks with a book .
402547	453228	95963	5.0	Stale	There has been too many cop films , but I can explain why this one dies . Not a bad film , but it's a copy of Lethal Weapon formula ; of two different types of police partners . It's a did that , done it before type of film . With no surprises , and the typical big ending . It's well directed , and acted , but the story kills this one .
403325	453228	295427	5.0	They showed all the good scenes on the trailer .	Spoiler ! ! The problem with this film is that they showed all the good scenes on the trailer . It was not a bad movie , but they ruined the surprise of the funny scenes . It had a lot of stupid humour in it . I would not say it was a kids ' movie . I especially liked the part where he disguised himself as Tony Montana ( Scarface ) . This is one for renting not seeing it on the big screen .
403064	453228	71772	5.0	Some good Some bad	This film has some good , and some bad . Parts work , and other stink ; this film is a 5 , not that bad , but not that good either . It is watchable , but I would not miss the bar on a Saturday night to see this . A young Stallone , and the Fonz in this film makes it a curiosity .
402878	453228	67023	5.0	That Would Drive Me Crazy	This movie is dated but holds up well . Joyride got a lot of its ideas from this movie . Dennis Weaver plays an excellent part . One can actually relate with his character . I do not understand why the trucker was so unstable . Big deal , someone passes you on the road . At least , Dennis didn't cut him off like a lot of drivers out there .
402910	453228	94812	5.0	Funny but average	Has its moments , but the movie sucks . I hate the relationship part of the story . The antics in the movie make me laugh . I would watch it for 15 minutes , but not the whole movie . Tim Robbens plays a very stupid guy .
402390	453228	288477	6.0	Average	I expected Gabrial Byne to play a much better role than this . He was excellent in the End of Days . The beginning reminded me of a college movie than ship hands . It was a bit PCish too . It finally picked up on the boat . There was some scary scenes . It had a predictable ending . The leading lady should of stayed on TV , ; she is not that great of an actress . I used to watch her on ER . If you are going to a scary / horror movie , go and see the Ring instead of this one .
403202	453228	321416	6.0	Not a bad TV movie , but still a TV movie .	I wonder how close the movie portrays reality . Did his wife have the influence this move enacts ? Was he a hot head ? The people were right about him marrying a loyalist , and the governor of Pen did the Job that was required , or this great nation and the republic it stands for would not exist today . Well acted and casted for a TV movie , but it is TV of quality . ABC , and the other 3 should watch out or there market share with cable will continue to dwindle . Tape it like I did and avoid the commercials .
403075	453228	126388	6.0	Not bad	I like history movies , so I like this one . Nice change for Van Damm he plays a different role . The film is interesting to follow . We have the reasons why people joined , and the harshness of being one . A solid 6 , and I would watch this film when they show it on TBS .
402897	453228	120347	6.0	I give it a	Not a bad movie , but average . The story is not that bad , but far fetched , and done like a Diehard film . They got too do something new with this series . One do all the Bond films need a count down in them ? Do the vilians all ways never make sure Bond is dead ? Does everything have to explode in these films ? Its redundant ! If you are the makers of a Bond film here is a few pointers . Maybe , have Bond hunted for a change ! Have him fend someone off in time for some help . Make a harder edge to it and add some new style to it like in Snatch or Pulp Fiction . The bad guys in this film where forgetable and not very scary . That Blond guy give me a break ! M her , aid , and the Admerial drag this film , they annoy the viewer with tripe . Roger Moore added humor and charm , Bronson had nothing to work with in this script . Bruce Willis could have played the British Gentalmen with this script . Its not a bad film , but if they want to continue with the series , they need some new blood .
402772	453228	93409	6.0	Average action film , very Hollywood .	Well , I remember more about what happened after this movie than about it . My friend had a bad incident with me after the film , and I believe this soured my view of this film . A very bad year ; don't let others choose your high school for you . That is besides the point , but on second viewing , years later , I still found the movie disappointing . The beginning is exciting , and Gary Busey's role is excellent with the cig lighter ; sort of a copy of Miami Vice with : buddies who don't like each other at first , black / white , machine guns , drugs , etc . Some of the other did this done that before ideas where , the old Nam team , car chases , the Dirty Harry jumper stunt , and the Rockford type of trailer Gibson lives in . It is still entertaining enough to watch , but I could never understand how this film brought on three or four sequels to it .
402462	453228	120755	6.0	6	It's ok , but you must like Woo's directing style to like this one . I gave it a 6 , no real surprises , by the number action film . Rent this one , it's nothing special . The casting could have been done better , but when a actor make like 12 million a movie it seems to hurt casting usually . If I watched it a couple more times I would like it more .
402560	453228	80894	6.0	Not bad for the Canadian Film board !	Not bad for the Canadian film board ! Actually watchable , and not its usual politically correct attack on the Catholic Church . I remember watching this film with my future wife while on Christmass break during collegde . This film give the viewer the feel of what Notre Dame Sask school was like . How the tourch was passed , how the Priest tried too instill toughness for the people to survive the difficult time they faced in the 30's and 40's . 6 or .
402710	453228	117918	6.0	Costner doesn't destroy this one	It is funny when he doesn't direct the film , the film actually turns out pretty good . The beginning and ending was strong , but the middle had too much filler material . Don Johnson plays an excellent role . He looked and had that sarcastic attitude as he did as Sonny Crockett on Miami Vice . I enjoyed this part . This movie was worth renting , but nothing to scream about .
403264	453228	183649	6.0	THIS FILM SURE IS SHORT 91 MINUTES	HOW FAR CAN YOU STRETCH A FILM ABOUT a PHONE BOOTH ? NOT LONG ! What did I like : Well it is original , something fresh . Believable , anything is possible after , and it today's hi tech society no one ever know who is watching . What I did not like : How much can you do with the script . Having it done in a Phone Booth restricted what could be done . This film , done on the cheap . The message at the end is twisted . My conclusion is the viewer gets to see the dark side , or the Jerry Springer version side of Joel Schuemecker .
403298	453228	293662	6.0	Like a 70's Hong Kong action flick !	This movie is comparable to an 80's Chuck Norris film , or many of Bruce Lee's films . I would not call it bad action wise , but not good story wise . I thought it would be like The Driver , but it evolves into Bradock Missing in Action , and then into a remake of Return of the Dragon . Entertaining and gets rid of anger , which I needed to vent out yesterday , but I kept saying to myself you got to be kidding with some of the story . Go see it if you like martial arts , and rocket attacks . Notice the heat seeker goes after the warm oven , I appreciate that detail . I give it a .
403209	453228	74899	6.0	Watched it on the History channel !	One of Heston's better performances , and overall watchable . Well directed , but the effects , script , and acting is dated in spots . I would watch the whole movie on TV , but would not stay up for it . Average movie nothing special here .
402790	453228	119375	6.0	You lose something in the subtitles	I saw the new version with Al Pacino and it was great . This one was good but I do not understand the language and lost the feel of the movie because of having to constantly read the subtitles . You miss little things like mannerisms and voice tones because of the language barrier . This film is a bit darker than the remake . It seems European films are always a little bit darker than the American counterpart . I hate the word insomnia because I suffer from this sometimes . I like the trailer part " No rest for the wicked . " I can relate with making a mistake due to lack of sleep which gets one in a pickle . I would of rated it higher but like I said you miss something with the subtitles .
402409	453228	129387	6.0	Just Ok	Spoiler ! ! ! Toilet junior high humor . I like this sort of humor , but such humor is either hit or miss . The grandma on speed was funny , along with the cops part . Other stuff was gross , or like the dog scene stupid . I heard so much hype and found the movie not able to live up all the praise . I hated the band , I was wondering if the bad singer getting shot was ment to be funny or relief ? I will let you the reader decide . Rent it , if there is nothing else left in the video store . Better than being stuck with Ishtar ; I still never had the nerve to rent that one . Comedy is hard to do , and I found this style of movie gets graded the hardest . PS The Pizza guy was a twist , and was funny near the end ; they should have used him sooner . The end , was weired as they come .
402936	453228	395699	6.0	Not bad	The Pacifier is an okay movie . What I personally dislike is not the film , but the preview . When a preview shows the best material in a movie , then the viewer sees a flatter movie . The preview basically tells the ending of a joke . When one hears the joke the listener loses the joke's effect . Thankfully , the movie is good enough to withstand the preview . I went with my wife , and younger family . Everyone enjoyed the movie . Disney knows how to entertain the whole family . The film was directed and written well . Vin and the rest of the cast do a good job . Violence , but of the A Team kind . You do not see anyone get killed . I give the Pacifier a . I wish they did not show so much in the preview .
403008	453228	398165	6.0	a second or 3rd movie rental for the night .	a 3rd rental for a movie night . T L Y is a by the numbers comedy , and performs the comedy by the numbers well . Enertaining movie , but no GroundHog Day . Very MTVish , and has a bit of the MTV style message with the film . The viewer will notice a few named actors , and a few named wrestlers , and football players . The Radiers Romanouski is in the film along with Stone Cold Steve Austin , and Kevin Nash . The football is executed well . Better than what the preview shows . A few parts could be cut on the floor . Well directed . Adam Sandler does a decent job , and finally stops doing the weird dumb and dumber humor . ( the weird humor got too much after the 3rd movie ) Very close to the original movie . Do not watch the original first before seeing the remake . Over all I would suggest renting The Longest Yard remake , but with another movie with it .
402733	453228	448157	6.0	A poor version of Ironman	With Ironman and the Hulk we now have Hancock . I did not mind Handcock , but the movie is just OK . Humor plays a huge role for the movie . The humor saves the movie from being forgettable , and the scripts kills the movie with a sad storyline in the 2an half . The Hulk and Ironman had the huge climax , while Handcock was more anti-climatic . Not the worse movie , but I would not buy the film either . My friend knew the guy who wrote the comic or story . I went to see how the film played out . 6 dollars out of 10 for movie entertainment . Why is there so many superhero movie out there ? I wonder if there is going be one too many superhero movie out there . Batman this week ? I wonder what will be in the next 2 weeks .
403072	453228	271367	6.0	Not bad	This film fun B schlop , but lacks enough testosterone . It tries to be like a 50's or 70's B horror film , and many parts they copied some of it well . What they lacked was a macho , over the top hero B actor like William Shanter to make it so bad its good . David can not do this and it lack something because of this . Too bad Shanter got old I really miss that over acting , but the special effects have improved over the years . Ok rental . .
402954	453228	389722	6.0	It was OK	My wife and I went out to see 30 days of night . Monica , my wife , says the movie was OK . It would be awful to have 30 days of nights , and worse to have vampires around , which is the premise of the movie . How could the survivors live if the vampires could smell the human's blood ? Well directed and acted . 30 days is similar to ' the thing , with the gross vampires , gross effects and the winter isolation which give a gloomy feel . The vampires wanted to leave no survivors so people would believe that vampires was just a myth . Hence , the vampires could continue on their feedings . I hate the end , but the end was original . My wife give a 5 , but I give the movie a . Definitely a rental
402579	453228	396171	6.0	I hated this film . Perfume smells like a fart .	My wife wanted to rent this film . A guy makes perfume off dead girls and because of the smell can memorize people and get away with murder . After watching this film , and the guy eventually dies the viewer feels riped off emotional . The film is so silly and stupid I wish they did something more with it . Too much a art form and not a movie . Maybe they could have used a UFO in it I don't know . . The film is watchable enough , but why waste one's time . I should have worked out instead . Film was kind sick and slimy . Perfume smells More like a fart ! Leaves a bad smell in the air . I can see why I don't remember it in the movie house .
402998	453228	830515	6.0	Not bad not good .	Quantum of Solace is not a bad movie or a good movie . The movie is a mix of the older Sean Connery James Bond movies and The Jason Bourne movies . The action is identical to the Jason Bourne movies . On a personal note , I like the Bourne movies better . Quatum of Solace is only a 1 and a half hour movie . A little too short for my taste . I heard the reason for the short running time was the last Bond movie would be too long and the 1 and a half hour movie Quantum of Solace is the continuation the last Bond story . The movie is based off the book Casion Royal and books usually make for long movies . Craig , the new Bond lacks the humor of the older Bonds , a part which is needed to relieve the intents action of the films . I give Quantum of Solace Spies . OK to go out and see , even better to rent .
403126	453228	77766	6.0	More the same !	This film is nothing special , it is just more the same . With some new twists . The shark is very hungry and Broady's older son wants to hang out with the teenagers they all are into boating , and take the chance of becoming potential shark food . I was rooting for the shark in this one . Its not bad , it's watchable , but far inferior to the original . I would give this a 6 out 0f 10
402495	453228	329101	6.0	Spoiler and the winner is ?	Spoiler and the winner is ? I would say Freddy , Jason isn't the sharpest Machette at the camp site . If his IQ is 70 that's about it ; Freddy can talk , and articulate a plan . This is why the movie focused around Freddy . Freddy gets the worst at the end of the movie , but the not too bright Jason gets the brunt of it throughout . In this matter the film is comical , like Bugs and Road runner . ( all they needed was the anvil and hot air balloon ) The story is original with Freddy needing Jason in order to create fear on Elm Street ; and I never knew Elm Street was so close to camp Crystal . The crime stats must have been high for that state . Entertaining in a stupid way .
402961	453228	546126	7.0	Solid show	More of life in a small town . Lacy is having a hard time adjusting to Dog River's social life . I notice how Lacy way over dress for the towns life style . Very Toronto style clothing . No one likes her free class idea . The town wonders what's up with the free class ? Hank is Hank in this show . Brent is the only guy who understands the whole situation . 7 dogs out of 10 dogs for the Dog River show . I love the theme song . It took 3 days to find your dog etc etc . I wonder if they Facebook a lot in Dog River . A good show . Did I write 10 lines yet . I hope I did . Now I got 10 lines . HA not yet . Nope not yet ! Almost got 10 lines . Now I did . Ha Ha
402956	453228	546101	7.0		How a rumor starts in a small town is what this show is about . I found you have a character like Hank who is crazy and makes crazy decisions we got a good story . Hank hears of Lacy's ex coming to town . A simple plain story . Hank deducts the ex is stalker , which is the reason Lacy moved to Dog River . In the end Hank's pretends to be Lacy's boyfriend . Funny concept , and is almost like a Sociology course on how rumors start . Brent is as usual the calming man of reason who provides balance for the show . I give My Ex's episode a . A very interesting , and funny show . Catch the reruns on Showcase . Corner Gas is like a University Sociology course on small towns .
402474	453228	250797	7.0	One should be happy with what one has	Richard Gere never ages . He seems to have a problem with his wives in movies ; they do not fair very well . I would not be surprised if this was a remake of a French film . It had an European style to it . Richard Gere plays the loving husband and Diane plays the wife that has too much time on her hands . The reverse of fatal attraction . A bit long . When events spin out of control , it leads to a tragic fate . This film is suspenseful which Richard is great at .
402489	453228	851759	7.0	I don't trust Hawkens .	Not a bad show . The subplot of the character Hawkens is interesting . I wonder what Hawkens is up too ? ( He's lot smarter than most of the town ) . I believe the town will catch on . Outside of the town is anchory , and I would not want to be the guy who is looking for information . The societal breakdown is turning people into animals . The writer for the series must use sociologist about the human factor for the show . . Interesting plots , and subplots . The show gets a little bogged down , but over all good . Rent the series . I saw one show last summer and found watching the series interesting . Fresh ideas for their has never been a nuclear fall out style show before .
402974	453228	119994	7.0	Surprised	This is a good movie , not a great one ; What would happen if you where framed for murder , in a strange land with strange laws , compared to your own . Fear is what this movie evokes , Richard Gear feels like an outsider , who is viewed of having western decident values , in a society where his lawyer states the groups importance over the individual in society . Admitance to guilt is considered aceptance of society's morality . This film gave me a sence of reality about communist society , and what its like in the comune part . Its a interesting movie . I read some of the reviews , and did not find this movie offenceive , it showed a side , but was not preachy . With movies like " The Texas Chainsaw Masacure , and Deliverence you see very few people complain that this is a bad sterotype of the south , most people find it a small picture of extremes not confused with the whole south . Thoes two movie went much farther then Red Corner .
402492	453228	1032139	7.0	Starts out strong ends gory .	The Supernatural episode " Fresh Blood " is one of the goriest episodes the series has made . The acting , directing , and script is intense , and excellently executed . The film makers could not vilify the Winchester brothers by killing a human Gordon so the script's plot twist turns Gordon into a vampire . The second half of Fresh Blood goes into overdrive . I found the second half less story and more gore , and tension oriented . A little over the top , I am sure over the top was the maker's intentions . I will have to watch Fresh Blood a couple of times to make a fair opinion . The show slows down , with a more serious side . Sam finally asks Dean to let him be part of Dean's life . Sam knows Dean is hurting and Dean's hero , suicidal risks taker in order to prove his worth attitude is a false front . Dean never lets anyone really get to know him . Finally , Sam saves Dean's life , and shows his stones with Gordon . Gordon never had the heads up for Sam . Sam beats Gordon in shear might , for Dean . Dean finally let's Sam be part of his life . He tries to teach Sam how to repair the Impala .
402514	453228	372183	7.0	Lags behind the first film !	Spoilers ! ! ! What a bad summer for movies , hopefully the fall schedule will improve . The film has a couple of huge flaws . One , the director , I can understand some of the shakey camera work in trying to create anxiety , with fast choppy thinking . Real life events can appear to the mind in this way , with the sensory overload . Trouble with the camera work is too shakey , were the viewers see nothing , and too long where the viewer either gets sick or confused . The style can be executed better . Two , the reason for the attempt on Bourne's life was weak , unless Bourne 3 will reveal a different reason . A huge let down for the climax . The crowd scenes , car chases , and fights with Bourne's wet work rival is the strong part of this movie . The ending saves the lack of story , and weak character in the first half . Why would they kill off all the strong characters from the first movie ? The Donald Rumsfield look alike is believable , and the brush cut , military / republican conservative looking agent gave realism for this series . This is like killing M in the Bond series . I hope Damon will not have this Clariss / Hannabil relationship with the new CIA women . Get a more original idea .
402315	453228	221027	7.0	a scaled down version of Good Fellows	SPOILERS . Not a bad film , worth seeing at the movie house . The film is done like Casino , and Good Fellows , music , pace etc . Its about a guy who is worried about money his whole life , and his mom would leave his dad for periods , because it was a big problem . He never listen to his dad's advice about money that its not as important as people . With the idea in his head about making alot of cash , and not having to work for it he became engrossed with greed . Money , does not solve all his problems , and the film shows the life of a non violent drug dealer . How much was left out of this film I do not know , but it shows his problems of back stabbing , phonies , bad relationships , ruined families , dishonesty , and incarceration , and it catches up . ( to the point where his wife complains about money just as his mother did ) This guy gets betrayed several times in the movie and for the damage he does to society he get a 100 years . Very solid !
403183	453228	408345	7.0	Firewall Burns	Firewall burns . Wow , what a ride ! The movie is a thriller ! The story of someone robbing a bank from the inside with a computer instead of a gun is high-tech . The family held hostage is the old school premise of the plot . Harrison Ford has acted in several stinkers , and I avoided Firewall's release . The preview on Satellite rekindled my interest . Firewall is a thriller ride , with a technological twist . E debt , pens with cameras , and global positioning . If the audience liked the movie Cellelar , Firewall is a perfect match . 7 or . I would give a 8 . Worth renting . Hopefully , the big banks cannot be beaten this easily . I do not believe that someone in this position should have access to everything . There has to be safe guards or else inside fraud would be rampant .
403246	453228	465538	7.0	Michael Clayton is an interesting flick	Michael Clayton is an interesting flick . Michael Clayton is similar in style too ' The Verdic ' and has a 70's feel in direction . The viewer wonders what will happen next . I found the movie hard to follow in places . Why would the female lawyer order the murders ? I did not know she was not part of the law firm until my wife told me . Anyways , George Clooney is a great actor and is pleasant too watch . The red book theme which in introduce over and over in the film is part of the story's revelation about finding consciousness . I guess Tom Wilkenson found morality as a lawyer in the end . Deep movie . The taxi cab ending is original . I never seen a movie end like that ! . Wait for the new releases at Block Buster for Michael Clayton .
402873	453228	304669	7.0	Family Movie	On par with the first movie . A Disney type movie that the whole family can view . Parts were funny , and where did they find those old toys I played with back in the 70's . Sappy and mellow in parts , and a Reindeer for comic relief . Worth taking the family out !
402613	453228	317919	7.0	The movies improve over time	The Mission Impossible movies improve over time . If one watches the first compared to the others one can notice the gradual improvement in the film series . MI3 did not work in two ways . The ending with the two bosses who was the real traitor , I was confused with the video replay , the movie never explains the plot twist . Too many different , characters , I found slows down the film's development . MI3 works in 3 others ways . The character of Ethan Hunt develops more and the viewer finds out that Hunt is a loyal , compassionate man who never quits . The fast pace is a credit for the director who generates the film's intensity . The stunts were better and more entertaining if one watches the other to MIs . A decent summer flick . A rebound for Cruise after War of the Worlds . Definitely rent .
403170	453228	987713	7.0	One of the weaker episodes	One of the weaker episodes . Why ? For being a great show and all the plot build up the writers of Supernatural had a hard task at hand . No one can blame the writers for the story climax of season two being such a let down . The town , the special kids duel and Sam's mother knowing the demon where all cheesy . The story would have made a great regular episode , but the writers had hard time trying too match the brilliance of the season one's final episode . I was not surprised if the writers are tring to add new ideas for the season 3 story lines . . I feel like there is a need for more . Maybe I need to watch this episode a second time , or wait to see if season 3 will make sense out to the season 2's story climax .
402384	453228	482599	7.0	I like this movie !	I like this movie . The photo imaging subplot is great . One notices the grainy quality which foreshadows a oncoming storm . The lighting is always dark , which gave me a feeling of dread which adds to the script . Always signs of sexual tension with the fashion industry characters . The three elements create a perfect storm of a women scorn . All 3 males act as if they have a wild secret . When the storm hits by the vengeful spirit the story theme about what comes around does go around is revealed . I like the surprise ending when obsession never ends and a broken heart begins . Be careful what one does there is always human feelings . A good mystery . A good date night movie . My friend Dax though run of the mill , but I like the story .
403080	453228	92675	7.0	Jean Claude Van Damme's first starring role	If you like Karate , you will love this . I like the fight scenes , and the bad guy in the film is always a bad guy in Karate movies . ( ie Enter The Dragon ) It is a bit sloppy in spots , but considering the budget you can not hit this film too hard . It is a good film to see if your mad or angry at someone .
403225	453228	425430	7.0	A good rental	A well crafted script ! The movie leads the viewer in one direction while unfolding the story in another . The viewer is on edge for he or she will not know what will happen next . Their is scary parts in the movie entwined with mystery elements for the rest . Well acted and directed . No gore or sadism like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . A movie a more mature young adult could watch , but not for kids . I like the idea of North Daktoa for the story . A very under used and rated state . I wonder if the Sunflower got sold to Altona in MB . . Hardcore horror fans will be bored . More middle of the road viewers , like myself , will enjoys ' The Messagers ' . Rent The Messagers ' this weekend .
403241	453228	86250	7.0	Ok Miami Vice before Miami Vice	Long films usually bore me , this is an exception . Yes a few parts could be cut out , but the length is there to tell the full story . It has a 80's Miami Vice rock videoish style of music with the story . Al does a great role along with Steve and the strong supporting cast backs ups the lead actors . The intention of the director is to show a violent , gritty , and corrupt film ; this perfectly reflects the drug world and the people who associate with it . The ending is a bit lame , but the film wants a impressionable ending .
402593	453228	407304	8.0	Best movie of the summer so far	Best movie of the summer so far . I found the movie very captivating , exciting and interesting . Wells ' is great writer , when one is listening to Freeman's narration of Wells ' writing from the book . Wilfred , my friend , says the book War of the Worlds is short , and I find this hard to believe . The movie could have been longer and explained the event more . I do not direct movies , I will leave this question to Spielberg . Hard to believe such a concept could come from a mind in the 1800's . H G Wells ' radio play caused panic with the idea , I believe back in the 30's . The movie is about survival during a war . Cruise plays someone who is lucky , and thinks at the same time . The part with the van is believable . The ending is the same as the 1953 movie my buddy Wilfred and I saw when we were both in grade 7 . I find reading the book or seeing the earlier version will ruin the movie , so watch this one first . see this one before it leaves the theater .
402825	453228	208092	8.0	Pulp Fiction with a mix of Good Fellas	This is a movie with a mix of Pulp fiction with Good Fellas . A British version of the 2 movies , with dark British humor . I loved this film and laughed so hard my wife looked at me a couple of time and elbowed me to stop it . I love dark humor and this film is full of it ; this movie is not for the politically correct crowd , its more a back lash to the violence in the media people . Brad Pit plays the role of a crazy perfectly , and has this on going joke where you could only understand half of what he says . You would get this joke if you lived or visited Nova Scotia or some place similar ( I have ) or got relatives who speak in a heavy English dialect . Its the same language but you can only make out about half of what is said . Pitt's character puts all the events into full swing of 5 different stories which meld into one , like Pulp Fiction . This film has shooting , boxing , butchering , and very nasty dialogue , with a good story to boot . Great film and I do not want to give away the story , my wife hated it , and wondered when it would end , but I could probably watch it a second time , and my wife will wonder if their is something wrong with me .
403323	453228	106950	8.0	Interesting Story	Its about a totalitarian society where people only have one chance at having a kid . They have this futuristic super max , with these ingestible detectors , and a computer mainframe warden . This film is great , watch for the scene with the d day computer virus , it is a classic . The character development , and acting is decent . Worth renting , I love this film .
403166	453228	427392	8.0	A better remake of the 1978 version .	What I like of ' The Invasion ' is the remake is different enough from the original that I did not experience the did this done this again feeling of many remakes . Solid acting and story . The modern technology theme is great with text messaging and virus genetic bug which reprograms ones DNA . The Invasions philosophy discussed by the Russian at the dinner party that man is still the animal which in the right circumstances will commit horrific act to advance or survival s is proved with the mother child bond where Kidman kills several to save her child . The contrast of the soulless body snatcher creating world peace , shows a world without feelings . The ending is positive but bitter sweet . . Worth a movie night out of the house .
402310	453228	268466	8.0	bought back memories of those Monday night games	This has got to be John Turturro's best role so far . He was actually believable as Cosell . It shows how Cosell made Monday Night football as much as everyone hated him . I remember some of those games and comments . He was always a guy full of surprise comments and an articulate verbal arsenal . They made Frank Gifford look really stupid in this movie . I also think they made a big mistake when they did not resign Cosell . They left out the famous speech between Cosell and Meredith . This is a must see for any Monday Night football fan .
403025	453228	120735	8.0	Pulp Fiction meets True Romance	This film is a splice between Pulp Fiction and True Romance . What it lacks in budget , it makes up in wit . A good story with a heavy English accent . I love the ending ; this film shows how many lives spin out of control by one event . This is a must see for Guy Richie fans . I wonder what he could have done with a bigger budget !
402319	453228	85995	8.0	Classic	This is the best of the Vacation movie series , and one of the few successful films Chev Chase has done . It is a what can go wrong does go wrong vacation ; the movie addresses vacation form hell scenarios of : relatives , in-laws , car problems , money problems , family trouble , with some sex appeal , and action added in to make the story spicy . Its a good movie and I gave it a .
403282	453228	478087	8.0	21 is a .	21 is a . The movie 21 has a compelling story , which is well acted , and directed . I love watching well executed movies . Will the protagonist get his money for college ? Is the professor an evil man ? How evil is the security firm ? These questions and more will be answered in the next couple of hours when viewing 21 . I enjoy watching Kevin Spacey who always plays a good creepy role . The only part I hated about the movie was when the pizza delivery guy interrupted the flick ! When does it take a hour to get a pizza , when the place is 10 minutes from my house . Well , that is besides the point . Worth downloading on payperview ! Payperview is cool and way cheaper than video rentals . I did not even have to take the movie back . Worth seeing on payperview . 21 is a or in IMDb terms a .
403001	453228	1222613	8.0	A good solid comedy !	Supernatural never takes itself too seriously . I love this comic episode which provides a break from the usual scarum dark side shows . Dean is the victim for the brunt of the script writers comic plot devices . The episode is about Dean getting the scary virus and is very unDean for the rest of the show . The Eye of the tiger part ? What is with that ? I love the chain ending . Sam saves Dean's bacon again . My wife loved this episode , especially with the Dog and Dean part . I give this show a . I though maybe the Trickster was back at it again . There is a second ending to this show so do shut the show off too soon !
402996	453228	1222615	8.0	Funny Funny Funny	Funny ! Funny ! Funny ! The fourth season of Supernatural uses humor way more than the first three seasons . I love the super strong kid scene . The Teddy bear scene is great too . The wishes end up being bad wishes . The sad part of the show is the geek's life is better off with the bad wish going wrong , but hey when you hit bottom there is no where to go but up . I like the message be careful what you wish for you might get it . The story's message of having everything you want drives you crazy is told excellently by Dean . Dean says he has his problems too . I agree . Well the Impelia make a great guest appearance and hits someone . Wishful Thinking is a .
402416	453228	93748	8.0	JOHN CANDY'S best	Spoiler ! ! ! ! This film is Candy's best ; too bad his career ended so early . Steve Martin ( SNL ) whose career started with a big bang , started to slowly die , and this was his last good film . Candy who never seems to get the roles or respect he deserved ( this was a tailor made character ) . The results were hilarious . I love the scene where Candy and Martin ( one of his first straight roles ) kept looking at the bed in the hotel room , with that camera close up and music . Then Candy asks if he wants a shower ; One of many great roles . The ending gets very serious , and we find that Martin actually has a heart .
403215	453228	371606	8.0	worth a few laughs	Worth a few laughs . My wife saw the preview , and thought it was cute , and wanted to see it ! She did not recognized any of the voices . The story is both interesting for both kids and adults . A lot of stupid behavior . The story has the same formula as the cry wolf story . No one believed him . The aliens remind me of the War of the worlds with the three legs and laser lights . The paper pants and a few other props were funny , a lot of imagination with the movie . The movie remake was interesting at the ending too . Patric Stewart from Star Trek does the teachers voice . . Good Christmass movie . Take kids or the girl friend .
402568	453228	443274	8.0	A very solid movie !	A very solid movie , but a little too smart . I like this movie . There is many camera close ups facial expressions and weird camera shots which creates each characters view point . I love the one character who thought the terrorist was in love with the man she was extorting . Well acted and direct , but the script has one to many sub plots . 2 presidents , and the ambulance part was way to over board . At least I thought the second half was to much . for a gusty movie which pushes the limits . Orinional concept of different vantagepoints . I do believe the ending where we never see the whole picture and the media makes mistakes . Denis Quade adds a human element for a movie .
402852	453228	98206	8.0	Sex , Violence , and humor	Many will hate this adolescent foray , but in my imature nature I liked it . This film does what many action film miss , it has a flow to it . The story keeps the viewer intrigued and the violence , humor and sex apeal puts sizzle into the steak . The pool cue scene is excelent , the tiger claw kun fu move is great , and the for a great Buick is funny . A bounce who is a philosopher is a nice twist . Rent it . . . . Watch it . . . . Love it . . . . . .
402779	453228	360009	8.0	WOW way too cool !	I don't know if it was the mood I was in , but I really like this film . Far fetched plot , but not too unbelievable . Val's acting can move a movie up a notch . I wonder if such hard methods as seen in this film ever take place ? The War on terror probably influenced the film makers . How Kilmer moves , thinks , and acts is believable of the character . The saddest part about this film is true scum bags do exist , I have very little empathy for scum . The movie's message of not believing what one hears is probably true . I wonder how much we hear , read , and watch is manipulated by the government , and the media . Spartan's art of deception is key for his success . How much media deception is a result of personal bias , or advertising pressure , or intellectual elitism is what I wonder after watching this film . The way the film ends makes me wonder if anyone finds out what the truth is ? Mike
403290	453228	107206	8.0	One of Eastwood's better ones	Well , Clint is a secret service man , who gets the much younger girl , ever wonder why its never the other way around , and has to battle and evil assassin . I wish they would stop this phone calling by the bad guy in this type of movie ; too over done like someone hiding in the back seat of a car , or a friend shooting someone before the hero gets shot . This film has tension , and fear . I like this film .
402667	453228	373883	8.0	Disturbing	Rob must have a Ph D in trailer trash . I hate to see what he has experienced in life for the film is very close to what I really know . I live in a city in Canada which has it share of domestic disasters and crime . Haddonfield must be a gritty steel town , for there seemed to be no balanced people in the film ; just rude and crude people . The film was very disturbing , a couple of people left the theater which was a good idea . The movie is gory , but not in a violent way . The home Michael grew up in was cold , abusive , ( verbally ) full of shame , no morals or respect , and no one cared . I learned from the neighbourhood I grew up in , and my life at the plant that people snap or break . Hell , creates anger and rage . The emotionless mask is the persona of a hallow man eaten away by anger and rage . The only outlet or expression for Michael is violence . A movie of a sick town , which knows only sex and violence . No love or compassion in this film . To close to real life . Bullies do cry when they get beat up . . This film is like seeing too much of real life .
402851	453228	84787	8.0	Great movie	" Any where but here ? " Is a line Kurt Russel says in this film . It is such a good film . I can watch it 20 times and never tier of it . You will stay glued to the set with this story , and when the people monster out you will jump out of your seat . Russel character is a role model for myself . He is not a wimpy , politically correct 90's guy ; who's into his own feelings , but a sarcastic , realist who is a hard drinking and toughf . Somone you would need in a situation like this . The suporting cast is just a good . Your typical group of guys with faults and different personalities , that would act stressed out in these situations . The plot makes alot of sence and is truly scary . Nice to see a believable film with real type people in it . Not your typical perfect hollywood types who a 2 dimentional story .
402391	453228	298130	8.0	Evil	This film was disturbing , scary and intriguing . The movie startsout strong and revolves around a mystery . Some of it is stupid , but most of the film is okay . The stupid stuff gets cleared up lateron in the film . I thought the movie was going to have anotherstupid horror film ending , but I was shocked . It leaves room for apart two . It is worth seeing in the theater . Do not see it if you donot like scary or evil movies .
403105	453228	61512	8.0	Cool Hand Luke a cool movie	I can see why in the old days the crime rate was lower , if this film represents the prison system . This is a powerful movie , and maintains an entertaining pace throughout . The beginning , the egg scene and the boxing match , make it a classic . The Newman , Kennedy , and Glasses characters will never be forgotten . In conclusion , a 30 year old film that still entertains , is a true piece of Americana .
402862	453228	1205489	8.0	A different time	A good movie about a different time . Walt Kowalski's character is a person from a different time set . I grew up in East Kildonan in Winnipeg and like the movie's portrayal of Detroit . We had many Walt's around . People who called it as they see it . People who never held back . People WHO love to bust other people verbally . Not very politically correct place to live . I got my turn to be verbally busted and people love to see how you can take it and what your worth is . In the end , Walt viewed people by their actions and respect was earned . I think Walt learned a few things about other people in Grand Torino . In the end the right person earned the Gran Torino . I love how they portrayed Walt's own family as a group of self absorbed people who never had time for dad unless they wanted something from him . Too bad we think so much about our selves and not others in today's world .
403171	453228	440963	9.0	The best film this summer so far !	The best film this summer so far ! Ulitmatum gives the series redemption from the disappointing Bourne Surpremacy . Well directed and acted , with strong character development . Noash the handler and the CIA director are the evil characters , while Nicky and others can not handle the guilt of the job , having a human side . The evil vs good premise is Bourne's personality . Bourne lives with his guilt as an assassin , but can still be a heartless machine . Ever scene Bourne is vigilant , alert , and thinking . Bourne is intelligently tactical he does one thing as subterfuge , while accomplishing another . Add in spectacular car chases , chases , and fights we have a great movie . Bourne mercy , and kindness saves his life in the end .
402979	453228	835248	9.0	Poor Gordon .	Poor Gordon , ever knew a guy who was a jerk who just did not get it ? Well , the character Gordon is the poster boy for I just don't get it ! Dean and Sam suffer with the emotional trauma of their dad's death . Dean is not facing the huge burden of the trauma and latches onto Gordon . Sam being smarter in his own way , gets hit for addressing Dean's problem . Dean who saved Gordon early on kicks Gordon's butt . Gordon acts and fights in true jerk form . Dean like myself hits Gordon when tied up too a chair , and says now I'am better . Does Gordon learn after this ? No ! Gordon will always place second against the Winchester boys . The real story for ' Blood Lust ' is the story of the two brothers dependence on each other . I found the crux of the story is where Sam and Dean learn / grow from each others character flaws . The flat character Gordon who is hateful is a contrast of what the Winchesters are not . . Gordon should have just left the Winchesters alone .
402976	453228	890836	9.0	Sam and Dean	My wife love this episode . There is many ' The Shinning ' references for this show IE room 237 . The story is about a ghost who formally lived there , and the destruction of anyone who tries to destroy the old inn . The drunk Sam part show ' Sam's pain and a softer side of Dean taken care of them . The old door man add a lot of humor , and asks Dean if he is going go cheepo on him for a tip . A bar scene with Dean is similar to the Loyd the bartender in ' The Shinning ' . The two girls in the ending remind me of the shinning also . Plaything is a tribute to the above mention movie . Grandma save the day for the movie while Sam and Dean are left wondering how the problem resolved . A surprise ending . I give the brother a tie on this hunt . Yes the dolls are creepy . They were mistaken for a couple in this show instead of brothers .
403155	453228	75148	9.0	Stalone's best	As much as the media mocks Stallone , he won best picture for this film . He will never top this film , which made him a icon . It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector / boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship , because of a late pull out by a contender , and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal . There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky , and together they make life livable . The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance . This film is touching , and unforgettable .
402668	453228	763065	10.0	Something Wicked this way comes .	I wonder if the old horror movie ' Something Wicked this way comes ' is the inspiration for the writers or writer of this episode . The idea of kids and the evil man is similar . This episode is well directed and acted . The story has twists , which blend well with the different types of music used for the episode . The viewer learns about Dean's childhood ( or lack of ) , and Dean's sacrifice for Sam . One understand Dean's connection with his brother , twisted view of life , and absolute awe of John Winchester ( his father ) . Great Horror movie special effects , and funny pranks ( aka the swimsuit inspector gag ) make for a great show . . One see a bit of ' Darkness Falls ' and ' They ' night terror influence in the movie . Most people can relate with a night terror plot from our childhood memories . I love this show .
402808	453228	93870	10.0	Realistic Cartoon	I went to this movie with skepticism , and left loving it . Fictitious , but with realism in the what if extent of the possibility of this happening . This is a good film about the victim finding out the question of Who am I . When the guy gets fired , you will understand how that goes with the prime directive . The commercials , and news stories create humor , and realism at the same time . I love the dark humor , they use the dad from " That 70's show " as a heel , with a lot of humor when he does a hit , where they play a video cd . The end is great , and the film goes full circle , but you got to laugh at what happens to the Ed 90 , and I love those Cobra Assault guns . Rent this if you love Sci-fi .
403157	453228	107048	10.0	Funny all the way through	Not many comedies keep their momentum all the way through , but this one does . I laughed at this movie until the end , and I gave it a 10 . No mater how many times I watch it or know the jokes ahead of time I still laugh . This film is like a old joke that never goes stale . Well written , by SCTV's Harold Ramius , this film brings a fresh approach to comedy . Bill Murrey is the best sort of jerk type guy for the role of a individual who has to live the same day over until he gets it right . Buy this one !
