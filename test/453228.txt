402907	453228	146316	1.0	Watch this one on Fast Forward I did	I knew this film would be painful , but my wife rented it on 3 for $5 Monday to Wednesday . This film is like the Morphin Power Rangers , except Lara Croft is a power ranger of one . The movie's plot makes about as much sense as a Morphen Power Ranger show . Stupid would be a compliment for this film . What I really hate is how they copy Raiders of the Lost Ark . How could a producer mix Morphen Power Rangers with such a classic . What sick minds did this ? What is next ? Lawrence Welk and WWE wrestling . There should be a suicide warning with this film
402431	453228	88993	1.0	Starts with and S and ends with a T you can guess what I think about this film ?	Spoiler This film is a grave dissapointment after watching Dawn of the Dead . Lower budget , no script , and unbelievable characters . No one could behave this way a survive . Drunk , rude , very unprofessional army , and un logical doctor , and a 2 dimentional Jamacian character that is written not well . I could not relate with any of the character unlike dawn 78 or 04 . What is with the 80's Miami vice feel to it . Maybe if they had Mike Thomas and D Johnson I would have like it more . Just some gross out effect it the end that did not look believable . Even more unbelievable is how the Zombies got in the bunker . I hate this film . When their is no room in hell the dead will be forced to watch this movie . Rent Isthar it's a better film . At least Isthar is scary even if that was not it's intention . .
403111	453228	218619	1.0	Truly Awful	Spoiler ! ! Another dream type film like Vanilla Sky ; just as awful . This movie confuses the viewer . It was in and out of reality . I do not like movies like this . There were some give a ways in the movie , but mostly this film was very confusing . I would not recommend this movie to anyone . Do not waste your time or money . Hollywood should come up with some better story lines .
403065	453228	87843	2.0	Too Long ! ! ! !	Too long , and not much of a story . There is scenes in this film , that one ask what does this have to do with the story . Good acting will go only so far , and with out a story the film dies . Do not even rent this one .
402871	453228	297162	2.0	This is just plain awful ! Quit while you can save face .	Steven is packing on the pounds . This is one movie that should of never been made . This movie will kill his career . He did not even do his usual martial arts in the movie ; it was left up to the other actors . I can see why , he really has let himself go . He will be doing direct to video movies next or info commercials . He tries to be so politically correct while other movies are more real life . He really should find a new career ; I guess teaching in a dujo is out of the question unless he finally controls his increasing weight problem . This movie was like a rap video and made as much sense . Even the action scenes looked sloppy and one of the scenes was a rip off from the movie Soldier . Stegall is a has been like Chuck Norris , who can't do more than TV or Total Gym commercials , or even Jean Claude Van Damme , what has he done , he doesn't even do info commercials . Maybe Stegall should invest in the Total Gym . Don't waste your money , wait for video cheap days .
402597	453228	71866	2.0	This film is bad , awful , don't watch	Well , I rented this film with my girl friend , and dad . I thought thisfilm would be cool . This is one of those 70's films , with a socialmessage , like Stegal's on Deadly ground and others . This filmhas a message and no story . What one see's in this film is 1People shooting melons , that has to be a film first . 2 Charlietalking a lot . 3 A bad guy who is one of dumbest in action history , with half the FBI looking for him he stays in the area to huntCharlie . The only good part , was during the gun fight Bronsonsays " Let's get this over with I got work to do " Don't rent , watch onlate night TV , leave this dog alone .
403093	453228	114857	2.0	This movie is so bad you know not to watch it !	This movie is so bad you know not to watch it , and my wife rented it not me . After Sunday dinner , at my mothers . my dad and I watched it . I could not believe that someone said Washington should have won an award for this film . A stupid story , how could this guy come to life ; this is like the Holldeck in Star Treck . Why did they keep using such a dangerious device . The best part of the movie was the credits . I though it would never end .
402770	453228	104714	3.0	Why did they make this one ?	Number 3 , why ? How far can they wear out this formula ? I started routing for the bad guys and maybe this way the series would be finito . Joe Pesci plays an annoying character . It makes me wonder what he is like in real life . This is a typical shootout hollywood ending . It is so predictable . The humor between the two main actors is getting old .
402392	453228	67525	3.0	What a dog of a movie !	Spoilers This movie is like an ugly prom date , a very unpleasent experience ! They would say , but the movie has great personality , a selling point for its missgivings . I like the sic fi concepts , but this film is for the hippie times . The 60's type cult zombi people , and how Heston dies , with the children around is too much . It seems movie from this time area always needed children , and negative ending where the hero dies . The part that gets me most , at least when the hero dies it should be a shock , like in To Live and Die in LA . Drop this one like a bad date .
402634	453228	117011	3.0	Another shootem up	Well another shootem up . Typical run around film with guns , revenge , and violence . Not much of a story . In fact I forgot most of what this film is about . Don't rent this one . I think the exercise infomertial would be more entertaining during late night .
402314	453228	120380	4.0	I did not mind it , but my wife did .	A rip off of Maximum Over Drive , but not that bad . I found the movie entertaining , with a strong ending . My wife hates this film . King writes a story that keeps my attention , and that is key for any good story . I warn the viewer this is a made for TV film . The better half , describes this in one word : Stupid ! Myself , a good b film . Between , our conflicting views this film rates a 3 or .
402663	453228	356150	4.0	Mindless crap	I do not want to be over critical , but this movie is mindless crap . Spoiled goofs act up as they head towards Europe . This has been done before . The usual shock , where they use it for humor . Shock is a bad substitute for humor . Nudity , running around , getting on sexually etc the geek suddenly becomes cool after this etc . When the viewer watches this he or she can see the joke before it happened . After the shock is over there is no real story to speak of . Ground Hog Day , and Vacation had good writing . This film is sizzle and no steak . They try to add a bunch of naughty sizzle to replace the writing . Besides being unbelievable , they take a big swipe at the Vatican , in today's troubled political times religion is a risky issue . Probably what they intended to do for shock value . The part that bothered me the most was the editing , there is a number of scenes where the actors lose their accents . The movie was done on the fast and it showed where the old 80's smart jerk humor gets across as lame . There where 2 good scenes in this film . The robot part , and the Manchester United scenes . They make this film some what more watchable .
402552	453228	84684	4.0	This is not a good film	This film has its moments , the big karate fight with John Kurby , the biker bit , but the rest I would not recommend . The acting except for John Kurby is awful . The budget is too low , and the director makes this film very choppy . John Kurby plays a good role and you could see what drove him crazy , after listening to this women and her kids , it reminds me of a shift at the post office . Anyways I give this film a 4 .
403258	453228	78908	4.0	Stupid	Ever see a horror movie and say stupid ? Well this one is . It was on Show Case ( In Canada ) A forgettable movie , don't waste your time . A typical low budget late 70's early 80's Canadian movie . When the government was giving out grants . Many horror movies around this time where awful cheap , bad acting etc . Reminds me of that movie with the water tank I can not remember the name , but also is stupid . Do something better with your time like hang around the paring lot , and miss this one
402704	453228	70915	4.0	Gator before Gator .	This film must have done well in the box office , in order to give Gator the budget it deserves . This film had no budget , needed a script rewrite , and a better ending . There is flashes of brilliance in this movie . The boat ride scene , Burt driving the mean machine , and his chat with his parents . You can tell Burt is a Southerner , and not a actor . This movie shows what Gator would be like , Burt's best film . Too , bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the Rush .
402595	453228	61578	4.0	Stupid movie	I found this movie stupid . For one thing they has a black man disguised as a Nazi ; I do not think this accurate . The plan of using death row inmates to do a deadly mission is too unreliable . The few that managed to escape is unbelievable ; Rambo is more believable that this . The only good thing in this film was Lee Marvin . Not worth watching .
402994	453228	82350	4.0	I liked it the first time I saw it	Years later this film runs out of gas . The acting is choppy , and the film quality is grainy . The kung fu is excellent , but the budget and time constraints hurt this flick . This reminds me of other early 80's horror films like the Hallowing , that where good then , but lame now . I believe time does judge all things after the hype die down .
403060	453228	70672	4.0	Lame film	My mom would not let me watch this film when I was in grade 2 , because she said it was too violent . Well , years later , and the only reason I remember this film is because of my mom , I stayed up and watch it on PBS . Well , maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film , but I found it lame . It did not age well , and this made the acting choppy , huge unbelievable holes in the script , but there is a few cool scenes like car chases , and a big gun fight . I will not stay up for this film again .
403061	453228	231496	4.0	Looks like one of this cheap movie they make for the office	When I went to Red River Comunity Colledge they use to show you business films like how to handle a business interview . Well I heard from my friend Tony that the 2 companys that did these low budgets but at leat respectable videos made no money , so the company from Denver decided to do a porno and made lots of money and the other from California does horro films . I guess the one from California did this one . What they call acting is right out of how I do a interview , and they did not even change the sad music from the busines videos . Even the cheap VHS camra is used . This film is bad , I gave it a 4 becuase they did surpringly well with the low budget , and non film experience , meaning this film was watchable , but awfull . In the end if you seen any of these office films at school or work rent it and compare it .
403129	453228	93483	5.0	Slow paced , dull .	I found this move is slow pace and dull they could have called it Stick 2 . Form the crowd of did this done that before . Very 80's action film , with very little to see here . Don't rent this one and watch another film .
402661	453228	340855	5.0	Not that great !	Gut feeling tells me that they left some of the truth out of this story ! They made the killer look nicer , and less crazy than real life . Who can say what makes one do these horrible deeds . Genes or environment whatever . I am sure there is a point where people snap in life . I found some of the film interesting , but the rest of the story has a 70's misunderstood bad guy theme to it . I find working at the post office with some very bitter people in it scary and unsettling ; they have a mean streak or hatred for the world I found missing in this film . The movie ' In cold blood ' is a better portrayal for this topic . Some of her victims were not the best quality people , but I sure hate to ever get in the way of this enraged , bitter woman . I find bitter people create more carnage , where I prefer the situation defused . Don't bother with this one .
402617	453228	80761	5.0	Doesn't age well	Warning spoiler sort of This film probably was exciting , and fresh for its time . I finally rented it because its the original , and sequels most of the time become so watered down , why make them . This film does not age well ; like most action films it follows a formula of building up tension , knife in the head effects etc . Done so many times before , and its a rip off of Halloween , a much better film . It bores the viewer with seen that , done that before approch . Special effects have improved so much in the last twenty year and gore is done a lot better . Decapitation is so common in movies to day , but in 1980 that was probably a shock . We live in the time of exploding bodies and computerization . The film shocked the hell out of every one in 80 , but tame by todays standards , the only real tension starts at the end , with a few twists and scares . I gave it a 5 . 2 at the start 4 in the middle with the typical lets make out theme , and 7 for the ending . The ending gave me a nightmare so thats not to bad , but doesn't save this film . /
402471	453228	93995	5.0	10 , no just joking , more like 5	This film has a great story , but the budget , acting , and music are awful . The screen writer wrote some extremely lame dialog , one will laugh at it . The strong point , I like the story . The story keeps the viewer watching , but can not save this film .
403357	453228	100519	5.0	Have to take Hamlet to understand this film .	# 3 of the films I have to watch for English litature . Confusing for my wife who never studied Hamlet , and the movie jogged my memory . One would miss some of the jokes if one never read Hamlet . The probability joke was funny at the beginning , and other parts leading to the middle were excellent . The movie bogs down in the middle , and reaches it's predestine conclusion . out of if you never read Hamlet and out of if you read Hamlet . I personal find I can get more out of 2 hour movie than 2 weeks with a book .
403332	453228	257408	5.0	The Fourth in the Series	I have rented all four in the series . They are all well done films . Nick plays Lucifer in all three and his role is believable . The story was surprisingly good . It seems the more they make of these films , the better they get . Mr . T . is in this one and his role is small . His role is not like the other roles one would see him in such as the A-Team . It had good court drama and a logical discussion about God . The series is starting to run out of steam , but it will be interesting when Left Behind 2 comes out .
402524	453228	117060	5.0	Well I seen worse	Not a bad movie , but his film was lacking something . I find when Brian DePalma directs he creates , sometimes , very cold and sterile movies like this one , and Snake eyes . Better then the second one in story , but colder in character then the first . I hope they do not make a mission impossible three .
403178	453228	417433	5.0	Okay	5 or . A bit contrived . The cast looks more like a PBS after school special . It is not like a more real life army movie . If the viewer has low expectations the movie is not bad . A good message about team work , and how bad family / community support can effect the individual . I can relate with the movies ' main character . Like Rocky , the protagonist overcomes the odds , finds character and leadership while the story unfolds . The captain in the movie makes the main character stronger . He knows that there is more to this person ' s ability than he is showing . The boxing matches were fine . Worth renting . . Soon to be a TBS late night movie . I like the John McCain story faith of my Fathers better .
402332	453228	976051	5.0	Artsy	The Reader is an artsy film . This movie is not for kids . The Reader is a very sexually charged movie . A young boy loses his youth to an older manipulative woman . The affair causes the protagonist pain with his future relationships . The woman is a Nazi with a sordid past , which comes full circle with the story . The viewer learns that the woman cannot read , and her shame or pride makes the character go through many painful and distasteful acts to hide her illiteracy . A sad train wreck conclusion is inevitable . A sad story about a sad part of history . I give this movie a . Interesting story , well acted , and directed . However , the story left me bothered .
402807	453228	65207	6.0	Rambo before its time	This film has more action in it than a Stalone flick . For a 60's film wow . It has all the World War 2 stuff in it . Nazi's , the warning buzzards , and a castle . Kind of like Wolfenstien the video game . Enertaining film , but not a classic . A bit dated , but stunts , film quality etc gets better with time . Good late night movie !
402772	453228	93409	6.0	Average action film , very Hollywood .	Well , I remember more about what happened after this movie than about it . My friend had a bad incident with me after the film , and I believe this soured my view of this film . A very bad year ; don't let others choose your high school for you . That is besides the point , but on second viewing , years later , I still found the movie disappointing . The beginning is exciting , and Gary Busey's role is excellent with the cig lighter ; sort of a copy of Miami Vice with : buddies who don't like each other at first , black / white , machine guns , drugs , etc . Some of the other did this done that before ideas where , the old Nam team , car chases , the Dirty Harry jumper stunt , and the Rockford type of trailer Gibson lives in . It is still entertaining enough to watch , but I could never understand how this film brought on three or four sequels to it .
402462	453228	120755	6.0	6	It's ok , but you must like Woo's directing style to like this one . I gave it a 6 , no real surprises , by the number action film . Rent this one , it's nothing special . The casting could have been done better , but when a actor make like 12 million a movie it seems to hurt casting usually . If I watched it a couple more times I would like it more .
402895	453228	86006	6.0	Not as bad as I heard it was	This film is supose to be so bad , I never rented it for years . I sure was wrong , I gave it a 6 , when I heard this movie was a 3 . James Bond comming out of traing to the live field is a ok concept . The film is on a lower budget , but they did well with what they have . This film shows how good of an actor Sean Connery is . Bronson with three time the budget never gets across in the mannor , or humor which Connery can . Connery makes this movie worth watching he adds so much to the scenes ; when he gets into a fight he gives it Bond magic . Connery delivers a one liner in a James Bond way . He maybe old , but there was still some gas in the tank .
402590	453228	328589	6.0	My wife likes this one	Well , the story gets a bit much for myself , being socially conservative , but one could say I am guilty of watching American Pie , so call me guilty for watching my wife's movie , which is like a romance novel . Not a John Wayne or Sylvester Stalone film . Tuscan Sun is entertaining , my friend Tony has told and this film repeats the love of life Itialian culture embraces . I watched Tuscan at my uncle's shown on his new TV set , hey Sony makes great sets , and my wife found the movie interesting . Diane Lane plays a financially rich person who can throw caution to the wind , and goes on a crazy path . I get to see how one with money can live and think . Even Chuck Norris makes a guest appearance , No just joking . I give the film a . This movie reminds me of the Hilton sisters that they show the jet set life styles .
402654	453228	1023111	6.0	not bad	My wife and my friends did not want to see this movie last Saturday , and I wanted too . So sad ! We saw a awful movie instead . On Sunday my wife and I went to the movie , and it was great . The movie had a great theme were one fights in order to have peace . The antagonist fought for the wrong reasons glory , and attention . The mix of mixed martial art , a love interest , and the kid who got over his anger is a great story . Never Back down also show why the characters act the way they do . I hope the antagonist learned some humility from his defeat . . Decent Karate movie . I love those movie and the crowd which attends them even more . . PS I will never grow up .
402952	453228	435705	6.0	Not bad , but not good either	Not bad , but not good either , the movie Next is OK . The story maintains the audiences attention . OK acting , and directing , intertwined with a science fiction ( Minority report ) theme of changing future events . Cage's character is hard to catch for his psychic premonitions make anyone pursuing him two or three steps behind . A scare with a twist changing time ending was neat . I will not totally give away the ending . On a lighter side , Jessica looks totally different from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre . I did not know that it was her . I have a premonition Next is a five , no I see a seven . Just wait the movie is a . Good rental .
402632	453228	111438	6.0	Second time around this film is better .	I was not to crazy when I saw this film the first time . Wow the second time I found the time travel cool . This film is cool when one looks at the plot twists . Not the greatest of action flicks , but a lot better then most . Watch it twice if you rent it and you will catch a few extra things .
403082	453228	107076	6.0	Just Ok	Not a bad film , but there is so many action hero films out there . This film has some neat fight scenes , and cool bad guys . It is too much at the ending , but what the hell . I give it a six , what is Van Dame doing lately anyways .
403034	453228	57115	6.0	Okay to watch	This film is shown all the time on the history station in Canada . It is not a bad movie . It is long , but interesting to watch . The cast was strong . It is a bit dated . It is a true story . I wonder how accurate the movie was to the book .
402923	453228	406759	6.0	More suspense than a horror movie .	I like the movie . A decent Wensdaynight date movie . ' The Eye ' is a horror movie , but also more of a mystery movie . After a eye transplant Jessica Able is able to see the dead . A mystery of who Jessica'a eye donor is ensues . Well directed and acted . The story's mystery is the engine which drives the movies to its suspenseful ending . I was guessing at the ending . Is ' The Ring ' a better movie ? You bet . I still like ' The Eye ' which is a good second feature on DVD night . A 6 or . Not a Texas Chainsaw Masscaure style film . ' The Eye ' is not a gore fest style horror movie . Take ' The Eye ' for what it is ! A mystery style horror movie .
403133	453228	178868	6.0	Strong start ends week	The Seatle remake is better . Well they had more money , and a second chance to improve on the ideas . I found the 2 movies simular at the beginning , with this fresh concept , but the last quarter runs out of steam . The buckets , and what to do with the tape etc is a little too much . Fresh , and watchable with subtitles . I give it a six .
403210	453228	60177	6.0	Not bad !	I remember going to see realatives in Kimberly BC , and the movie was on at 2 am which is 4 am central time . I missed it , and they have better TV out west to boot . Years later I got to see this film . Swank for its time , and entertaining for a long movie . A young Gorge Pepard plays a swank hot shot pilot , who is an out cast , because of his lower social class . In the end his attitude , and escapades catch up . Worth watching for a 66's war movie .
402912	453228	111756	6.0	Watchable	My dad hates this film and I watch it with little expectations and enjoyed it . Not the best movie ever , but I like the grittiness of it . The part where they show him in the bar , and how his life led to his moment with destiny . It is unfair to compare this to Tombstone , when they both came out , because Tombstone is a classic . This film is worth a look . 6 or .
402586	453228	382992	6.0	Run of the mill summer movie	Run of the mill summer movie . Action , flesh , and romance in a summer movie . The staple of any summer movie . Stealth has Biel and Lucas as leads , and both actors perform well considering the material given . Foxx why did you take that role ? I hope Foxx's answer is money . What worked is the plane look real , and I could see pilot-less planes one day . What did not work . Why would a computer download music ? Answer for the movie soundtrack , in order to sell CD's . Why did the computer go haywire ? The question should have been answered . I like the Alaska and North Korea bit , but a little too Ramboish . . It is an okay movie , save it for a rental on a rainy night .
402495	453228	329101	6.0	Spoiler and the winner is ?	Spoiler and the winner is ? I would say Freddy , Jason isn't the sharpest Machette at the camp site . If his IQ is 70 that's about it ; Freddy can talk , and articulate a plan . This is why the movie focused around Freddy . Freddy gets the worst at the end of the movie , but the not too bright Jason gets the brunt of it throughout . In this matter the film is comical , like Bugs and Road runner . ( all they needed was the anvil and hot air balloon ) The story is original with Freddy needing Jason in order to create fear on Elm Street ; and I never knew Elm Street was so close to camp Crystal . The crime stats must have been high for that state . Entertaining in a stupid way .
402644	453228	94791	6.0	Not bad for a TV movie !	This film is not bad for a TV movie . B actor Richard Chamberlen king of 80's TV mini series does a fine acting job . The casting is fine , and the shoot in Europe is excellent . Not as good as the higher budget theater released movie , but this is expected . The TV version has filler in it that drags the show on . Watch the newer one first .
402734	453228	546104	7.0	Sexual humor !	Sexual humor . There is some sexual humor added to cell phone size in this episode . The episode Cell phone has the Constable , and Brent pitted against each other over who has the smaller phone . In the end Lacy tell them they got little Barbie phones . Feeling inferior both the constable and Brent get these huge vintage 1980's cell phones in order to prove they no longer need a small phone . I could never figure out why people want small cell phones . Small phones are too hard to use . I guess lacy is right . A for Cell Phone . I was surprise Hank was not involved in the Cell phone argument . I would go nuts living in Dog River over such crazy conversations . Reminds me of life at the post office .
402404	453228	97670	7.0	What Goes around comes around	This movie has the old saying , " What goes around comes around . " This movie shows how other cultures differ in their beliefs . You see that one's beliefs are accepted by one and rejected by the other . One will also see the hypocrisy of the culture . Things are okay to do as long as it is not in your own backyard or to your family .
403152	453228	91203	7.0	The more times I see it the less I like it	This film is a good film . but the more I watch it the acting appears choppy . It a great story , about people who only die from decapitation . They don't age and sword fight each other through out time . For a time will come when they have a reckoning and must fight for the prize . Sean Connery is the mentor for the leading actor , and plays a great role . Its a good story , and it is written as a original , the sequels destroy the whole concept , and look silly . The acting is ok and the story is great , I give this movie a 7 .
402746	453228	349903	7.0	About as good as the original !	Ocean's 12 is on par with Ocean's 11 . Both movies jump around on the emotional level . The viewer finds parts of the movie boring and would rate Ocean's a 3 . Then other parts of Ocean's become a 10 . Once the viewer averages Ocean's 12 out the overall rating is a 6 or . The story is weak in parts , and strong in others . The Julia Roberts bit is the highlight . Bruce Willis is great . The director's 70's or late 60's European feel is too much . Looks like a cheesy film they show on the showcase network with a low budget feel . The use of camera angles , and trickery takes the focus off the film . If a film lacks budget they use these tricks , and Ocean's 12 has no reason to use this . The acting is excellent considering the script . Brad Pitt was misused , could have added more for his character . My dad felt the same about Ocean's 12 . I would rather go see Flight of the Phoneix . Wait for video or on demand . 7 or .
402554	453228	87727	7.0	See part 2 before you see part 1	I heard both movie where filmed together , but they mixed up the releases and put 1 as 2 and vis versa ; that was what the video store clerk told me . So watch 2 before you see 1 . This film is not bad . I love the Karate , and Chuck finely has a high budget for some great stunts . The story is interesting , and the action just rocks . If you want to watch a movie with a pizza , and beer this would be it . Very 80's and I chant USA to this one with my friends , we do that because we remember thats what the crowd chanted at wrestling for the American good guy , when he fought the forces of evil .
403150	453228	70355	7.0	violent	This film broke a few rules in violence when it came out . The first scene in this film is pretty graphic , and gives the viewer an idea of what to expect . TBS has to edit this movie extremely . I like it , not the best acting or script , but the concept is great . Eastwood is great and is the only one to pull this story off . The action scenarios have been copied to death , but in 73 it would have been ground breaking . The feel this movie projects of vigilantism make it a bench mark others have followed . If imitation is complementary this film is a standard other action films follow .
403213	453228	58947	7.0	One of the better 1960's WW II movies	Good acting , big name actors , and a lot of Tanks make this exciting to watch . The Panzerline March song adds to the film . Some dated scenes and effects , but overall a good picture . Robert Shaw shines in his performance . It will be on PBS again .
403030	453228	85121	7.0	Interesting	This film is interesting . A crazed , women killer who use the system for his own benifit . Bronson play a Death Wish type cop who resorts to vigalatism or dirty cop methods to stop this . I found my wife interested in this film , the horror aspect is like a made for TV movie marketed towards women . This is one of Bronson's better films !
402485	453228	477348	7.0	Not bad , but could have been a better ending	I believe the movie is about the randomness of life . All the random events , and choices lead to each character's fate . Order through chaos is the movies theme ! That is why the antagonist flips a coin , and gives people the choice of head or tails . The coin toss reflects fate and fates effect by choices one makes out of free will . That is why the antagonist went after the other characters wife , even when there was no reason for it , because the antagonist gave the character the choice to come in or his wife will die . The movie is interesting , and the story is good . I like how the two characters who let's call trouble shooter are disjointed with the world . Good at what they do , but are a Little out of touch . Just like this movie . . A good rental . Maybe that is why the ending is so disjointed .
403317	453228	76752	7.0	More humor than the others	This film is not as silly as " The man with the Golden Gun " , but not as serious as " For your eyes Only " this film is in the middle . I thought the film drags in the first half , but my wife disagrees . It has all the Bond saves the world excitement , with huge explosions at the ending . This film introduces the Jaws character to infuse some new blood for the Bond series .
402564	453228	319343	7.0	Good	Spoiler Will will be the next Bill Murry . Not to many actors could pull this character off , and Willy did it ! Funny film , geared for the kids , but entertaining for adults too . The Santa is coming part is very good , and the fight with the department store santa is the best . I wonder if Willy can be this strange in real life too . Maybe he could play a movie about me if they ever did a movie on me . Well go out and watch it this for Christmas . Mike
403067	453228	243585	7.0	Just as good as the first	I thought this sequel was just as good as the first . Michael J . Fox is great as the voice for Stuart . I could not figure who was the little bird til the end . Melanie Griffith did a terrific job . I was surprised to see James Wood as a voice of the falcon , but as soon as I heard the voice I knew who it was . He always plays a great bad guy . The story is great as it continues from the first . It was different enough from the first that it was a good sequel . I believe kids will enjoy this film . It is great family entertainment . It has something for everyone .
403341	453228	230600	7.0	Eerie	Spoiler My wife thought this film is eerie , but this film drags a little at the beginning . Scary , and confusing , with a slow build up of tension . I found a few parts lame , but I believe the director wants confusion in this story . My wife finds a weird twist for the ending , but ( spoiler ) I found it too similar with The six sense .
402498	453228	280665	7.0	Better than expected	Not a bad film , but is confusing and loses focus in parts . This film is European Chic and has nudity , and shock aspects . Parts of this film copies the European plot twists , what ifs , and style . Like many European Chic style films it's plot becomes too smart . Over all , I like this movie , but they could have cut 2 or 3 scenes out and tried to clear up some of the confusion .
403138	453228	79116	7.0	Worth watching a second time	I was watching this film , on the history channel Eastwood is great , and one never loses interest with the story . A done it , seen it before film , but a pleasure to watch for its craftsmanship . I give it a . Rent it , if nothing else is at the video store .
403161	453228	111742	7.0	New Idea	It is nice to see a new idea in Hollywood . The warewolf concept is over done , and this movie does a fresh twist to the concept . The movie is original and fun to watch . Jack is one of the best and does this film justice , and the story's twists keep the viewer jumping . This has the businessman bit by a wolf and shows the affects it has on the individual's life . I will say no more or I will ruin this film .
402456	453228	187393	7.0	A solid 7	I read the news paper review in the Winnipeg Free Press , and the guy chopped the movie down . I decided to take my wife out anyways , because the reporter started to run anti American diatribe and would hate the movie regardless . The journalist should learn some professionalism , because the movie was not that bad . I gave it a solid 7 and I would probably have to see it a second time to pick up details I missed the first time , and probably like the movie even more . Gibson is such a good actor , his accent helps in this film to give it realism . Gibson is the type of actor whos physical gestures can really make a seen . It has great villains , family , revenge , and historical perspective that makes the movie believable . The comeback of the historical epic is a nice change from your by the numbers , humdrum , action flicks . This film will shock you , inspire you , and make you laugh . My wife cried during one of the scenes , and if a movie can do that to a person , I think its worth the $8 . 50 .
402887	453228	183790	7.0	Well ok sort of	I liked this film the Jousting was great , and who ever did those realistic scenes should get and award . This film is a pleasant surprise , and the acting is not bad . The script does not insult the viewer either . Why did they use classic rock music , its use is out of place , this is not a biker movie , did they listen to AC / DC in midevil times ? Why the film makers did this is beyond logic ! Other than that one weak point , the film is time well spent .
402354	453228	119314	7.0	Deep feeling movie	Warning sorta spoiler of story I gave it a 6 and my wife gave it a 8 so we voted 7 . I am a restless sort who usually likes action films , and my wife is the romantic type . This film is a love story slash western ; my wife felt sorry for the horse and little girl in the movie . The scenery is unbelievable , and the portrayal of western life is on the mark . The horses were the true stars and this story is more then the taming of a horse and its change of heart ; its much deeper with a parallel of the horses pain relating to the hurting girl and the heart of her mother . My wife loves this movie , and would recommend this story to romantics everywhere .
402674	453228	762121	7.0	A solid film	A solid film . Well , directed , acted , and the story follows the Bible closely . Not as good as ' The Passion ' for the Passion had better actors and Gibson is a great director . However , ' The Nativity Story ' is done on a good budget . One gains a understanding of the pain and sacrifice Mary and Joseph endured . The movie portrays the evils of man , by Herrod's reaction to the good news of the birth of ' The King of Kings ' . What a sadness for Herrod's slaughter of the innocents . One gains the historical perspective of the time with the poverty of farming , and the harshness of the Romans and tax collectors . . Maybe 8 ! I love true story they are so much better than fiction .
402537	453228	313542	7.0	Not bad	Not a bad movie , it gets weaker as it ends . What I hate about this movie is the anti gun message when they blame it on the manufacture instead of the government ! It's funny how the manufacture gets blamed and never broke the law but the gov for having ever introducing the right law or evening caring is never to blame . Like with tobaco they keep it legal and make taxes on it but they never get sued . The movie is interesting utill the end . I wish it ended a bit darker , you will see what I mean if you watch it . Not a bad movie I give it a .
403182	453228	393735	7.0	One of Disney's better films .	I was pleasantly surprised with the film , Shaggy Dog . Shaggy Dog was the first feature at the drive-in . I avoided seeing this film in the theater and thought that it was okay to see it at the drive-in as you see 2 movies for the price of 1 . It was better than the second feature actually . The film gives a dog's point of view on life . Tim Allen is silly enough to make the role believable . The chasing of the tail , frisbees and the shaking of the head to remove water was portrayed perfectly . Shaggy Dog kept the viewer interested with what was going to happen next . The film is a family movie that everyone will like . I wondered why they used a sheep dog ? There are many other types that could of been utilized . . Worth seeing !
403080	453228	92675	7.0	Jean Claude Van Damme's first starring role	If you like Karate , you will love this . I like the fight scenes , and the bad guy in the film is always a bad guy in Karate movies . ( ie Enter The Dragon ) It is a bit sloppy in spots , but considering the budget you can not hit this film too hard . It is a good film to see if your mad or angry at someone .
403089	453228	90713	7.0	Ever have and event that you could never out live .	Spoiler This movie is about such a concept . Williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life . Russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school . Finally the under dog get its shot , and Williams can save face , instead of being the clown . A great reverse tragedy .
402461	453228	172495	7.0	A solid 7	This is a good movie , not a great movie . Better to see on the big screen , and it is worth the 8 . 50 I paid for . I am a follower of history , and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or hollywood or politically correct film , in order to have a believable script . It did , the story was a little hollywood , but gave a good description of the brutality , and views of the time . I will not spoil the story , but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play , with revenge being the main motivator in the story line . This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time , and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy . A good epic . The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic , and the action is done with perfection . It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day , because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film . The film wasn't too long either , and that is good considering how long it was . I gave it a 7 maybe , because it didn't grab me , but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more .
403353	453228	901201	7.0	I did not mind this show	I did not mind this show . The old mayor is better than the new one . Old mayor ( Green ) thinks long term , not reactionary like the new one . I like the bluff about the bridge . Revenwood knew what the losses where and left . Hawkens proves to be useful again . The show bogs down with some of the relationship part , but my wife likes it . We see Urich slowly becoming a leader . Will the town survive the winter ? Will there be disorder ? . Not a bad show . Jericho is slowly getting better . A big budget compared to those wimpy sit-coms . I hope they keep adding to the cast . A few new faces will help the show . Will Ravenwood ever get it ?
403241	453228	86250	7.0	Ok Miami Vice before Miami Vice	Long films usually bore me , this is an exception . Yes a few parts could be cut out , but the length is there to tell the full story . It has a 80's Miami Vice rock videoish style of music with the story . Al does a great role along with Steve and the strong supporting cast backs ups the lead actors . The intention of the director is to show a violent , gritty , and corrupt film ; this perfectly reflects the drug world and the people who associate with it . The ending is a bit lame , but the film wants a impressionable ending .
403177	453228	415306	7.0	a alright movie	The preview make the movie look too stupid . I thought the movie would be another Anchorman . A movie can be too much Will Ferel , like the Anchorman . This movie had a right mix , and the humor is spread out evenly . I did not like the comments on J C , for years of Catholic school I would be careful on such humor . Too much adverting in the movie . One restaurant chain is mention at least 5 time . I like the chain . Turn your brain off the movie is OK . . If you miss it that is OK rent it . I like how the south has no problem joking about itself . Humor is hard to do ! Ferel keeps getting better with time . I can see Ferel doing a few old Bill Murry roles . I like the I am on fire bit . The video game part is good . A bad summer for movies .
403295	453228	58886	8.0	One of Hestons best .	When will it be ready ? When its done ! This is a great portrayal of Michal Angelo . Heston's high water mark , and this is hard to out do . Even with the films age it does not look dated . Much better than other movies form this time period . This is a movie with a message . Rent it or even buy it .
402336	453228	268380	8.0	Love that squirrel	This was a great animation with lots of humor . Denis Leary's voice is always recognizable . This film is great for kids but also entertaining for adults . The voices suited the characters . This is one that I will purchase when it comes out . I felt sorry for the doodoo birds . A good family orientated film .
402379	453228	1222593	8.0	Neat Episode !	I like this episode . I believe one of the plot devices in Time is on my Side will be used for future episodes . Franinstein , is a awful concept . I like how the brothers devisions is a for shadow of what is happening to the characters . Dean is so street smart . I like how Dean outsmarted the Dr Evil guy . Well for this show . One of the grosser episodes . a few tributes to a couple of movies here . Will the Trickster ever comeback ? Will Bella comeback next season ? There is so many lose ends we need a season 4 ! PS The fridge part was so eerie . I like how Dean just hate the doctor . Dean dose not want to be just a evil as the things they hunt .
402331	453228	159881	8.0	I watch this game show off and on again .	I watch Jeopardy on and off again . I do not mind Jeopardy , but sometimes the questions become too mundane . The guests are the same old same old . The show is great and has been copied over and over again . The show ' Who wants to be a millionaire ' is influenced by Jeopardy . I believe Jeopardy is the prelude for reality T V . Alex is a great host . I do not like game shows and I give Jeopardy an eight , which mean Jeopardy is a great show . How long has Jeopardy been on ? The only shows which have been on longer are The Price is Right , and Wheel of Fortune . Jeopardy is a TV icon . Viewers will be seeing Jeopardy for a long time to come . Worth watching .
402917	453228	197151	8.0	Not bad or worse than any other news show .	FoX news is just another news show . Not better or worse than anyother news show . People complain of Fox news being slanted more to the far right . I disagree ! Fox news was ahead of news trend . When news was more left leaning , and some shows where manufacturing news via opinion fox news and Rush Limbaugh were a schock to the system . Now every news cast has a right-wing show or person on staff commentary . I believe with satellite radio , more TV stations and internet the media is much more careful to slant an issue because of how easy the viewer can access a reproof . Fox is ahead of it time , and schoking then , but now just average news . .
402328	453228	963178	8.0	Just saw it great film !	Just saw it great film . The International is about a bank which uses illegal methods for their investments . Resonates well with the audience after the banking crisis . Well written , directed and acted . One of Owens best performances to date . Watts had a strong supporting role . I would buy the blue ray for The International . I give the movie 8 dollars out of 10 . The movie makes me wonder what do the banks invest in which we have no idea about ? The ending of the movie asks these questions . Watch the ending credits . I would watch this film again . One of the best gun battles I have ever seen in a movie . The gun battle alone is worth the 8$ .
402766	453228	265662	8.0	Believe in your dreams	What is meant to be will happen . Saint Rita interceded , and with God anything can happen is the message . This movie displays hope in a hopeless world . Which is a good message , and an inspiration for all . This is a happy story , and a movie about values and people . Where I work many of my coworkers hope for others to fail , and this movie shows what supportive people can achieve .
402430	453228	195685	8.0	Roberts best	I was waiting for this huge social lecture ; I like these type of films , but hate the lectures . Instead , I found a entertaining , yet realistically acted film . It was enjoyable to watch how mistakes happen , intentionally , or people just not caring , and lawyers ( for a change not being the bad guy ) give people the opportunity for amends . Regrettably money will never be a true payment for justice , but the people at least were able to move . I wonder how many of these man made disasters happen ? In Canada , we seem too have cover ups where I read the paper , and nothing ever get resolved with many issues . I wonder if they get settled out of court . A movie is like a few pictures of a very complex event . I found this movie , it may have been dramatized , gave me a better understanding of the events .
402435	453228	77531	8.0	One of Stallone's best	This film is done on a very low budget , and its a great film . Some times , low budget film compensate with good acting . The script , probably has some real life experiences in it , with a few of the scenes , especialy with the apple boxes , and the double cross part in the film . After watching this film , I thought this film is great , and I am happy I spent my time watching a true gem .
402960	453228	800080	8.0	Different with out Eric but Norton is a great replacement .	The Hulk is a well directed , and crafted movie . The back in time , and present time filming creates a great mise en scene ! The continuity of the directing creates a great pace where the viewer is enthralled with the story . Eric Bana did the last film and Norton had big shoes to fill . Norton especially with the beginning scene of hiding in Brazil , plays the on the run Bruce Banner character excellently . The ending is great , I was shocked . William Hurt plays a good bad guy again . I will not ruin the ending , but will give a hint . There is a clue to the ending at the beginning of the movie . Two merged into one is all is my hint . green monsters
402982	453228	775325	8.0	Perplexing	' Devil's Trap ' is a perplexing episode with plots and twists which creates the illusion of one event , while another actually unfolds . The unfolding story leads the viewer wanting more . Devil's Trap's character development of the omnipotent one , John Winchester , creates John's own downfall . Sam and Dean have to handle 2 missions at one time . Will Sam and Dean save a family from Iowa from a Y . E . D attack and can they help their dad who is on a different mission ? I love Dean's statement about whipping the Y . E . D , but no such luck . Sam almost burns himself out of hatred for the Y . E . D . Devil's Trap is a two part episode because of the stunning conclusion . . I love this show . I just got season 2 on DVD .
403238	453228	70909	8.0	Great classic	Do not let the age of this film fool you , this is a good film . The terminator before Arnold came around . It is an amusement park that goes amuk , and it becomes the vacation from hell . I can watch this film over and over , with its cool concept . This is great sci-fi and comparing it to other sci-fi films this one is a leader for other to copy .
403318	453228	86034	8.0	The last good Jame Bond Movie	This was the last of the James Bond movie too have that Bond magic to it . One of Moores better Bond movies along with Man with the Golden gun , and For your eyes only . This film keeps the humor and non seriousness which makes the Bond films enjoyable . Excellent stunts , funny moments , and a interesting plot , gives this film the Bond magic , which was missing with Tim Dalton . I love the scene when a tour group asks Bond what travel tour he is with , and he say economey . I hope the new Bond can create some of this magic .
402942	453228	419125	8.0	Excellent bio	I do not know how true this film is , especially with the time constraints of the movie , but I learned much about Arnold for myself . Confidence and drive is important and essential in order to survive in life's journey and Arnold knows this . The viewer learns that Arnold is brash and positive , and would be hated by negative people everywhere ; negative people would find Arnold arrogant , while more mentally healthy individuals would find Arnold's positive attitude contagious . Arnold's visualization and attitude , is no sales act in order to use people , but the natural personality of a driven man . The movie addresses the harshness of Arnold's childhood , and his need of acceptance . ( A Freud theory in this movie ) Many Dads want their sons to have a toughness and hunger , but balanced with love . A theme throughout this film . I , myself may be seen as cocky , and mistaken as a jerk without a softer side ; I believe the director shows a softer side to Arnold that only people who really know the man could tell . I would have to look into Arnold's eyes too really know the man . Compassion is not a event to boast about but a more private side . I learned about Arnold from this film and found this film to be a comedy / auto bio , which I think is how Arnold is . 8 or . Great TV movie . A & E sure can make better TV movies than the networks . I would not be surprised if a network makes a whole movie about Arnold's life from childhood on . I wonder if Arnold would write an auto bio ?
402311	453228	80310	9.0	One excellent picture .	The Australian film board has done excellent work , compared to Canada we should be ashamed . Except for arty films , or ultra left wing films , which sometimes insult the public they never have come close to making a watchable film . Who ever did the casting for Breaker Morant , did an excellent job . Woodward , Brown , etc and the actor who plays Clark where standouts in a cast without one weak actor . The script and filming looks , and sounds turn of the century . ( well researched ) Did they deserve to be shot , I do not know . In my opinion , ( I know that sounds wordy ) this film hit true too life . Comparable with today's Political Correctness many decisions become political instead of truthful . How many job interviews , hearings , University acceptances , fights between people will be decided before the interview , trial , application , or discussion has began . I believe the truth is always unpopular but eventually appears . This film is an excellent portrayal of the human condition .
403275	453228	1222612	9.0	Prelude to the Season final .	This guy is changing from a human to a flesh eating monster . A hunter says Sam and Dean have to kill him and any offspring from the monster . I believe the guy was changing into a monster . The right decision was made with the boys flaming the monster in the making . The episode is the micro of the macro . Will Sam Metamorphosis into a demonic monster ? Will Dean pull the Gordon on Sam ? These questions will be addressed as the season unfolds . A tease or taste of future events . A good episode . The series gets stronger with each new episode . I just can not wait for next week show . The real Ruby should come out soon or later . I bet Dean will but heads with her .
402352	453228	120188	9.0	Surprised	I was surprised when I left this film . I did not think highly of this film when I went to see it , but when I left it the film blew my mind . In todays , world of cynicism Rambo , heroes , and Regan became 80ish and Cliton , Pulp Fiction , and brutial realism reflects the late 90's culter . This film is on the mark for the late 90's feel of brutial realism . A film that show how stupid military people can be . How brutial deat is . The human side of all people . It is not afraid to be un politically correct with realistic acting that shows good and bad sides of people . A good film .
402979	453228	835248	9.0	Poor Gordon .	Poor Gordon , ever knew a guy who was a jerk who just did not get it ? Well , the character Gordon is the poster boy for I just don't get it ! Dean and Sam suffer with the emotional trauma of their dad's death . Dean is not facing the huge burden of the trauma and latches onto Gordon . Sam being smarter in his own way , gets hit for addressing Dean's problem . Dean who saved Gordon early on kicks Gordon's butt . Gordon acts and fights in true jerk form . Dean like myself hits Gordon when tied up too a chair , and says now I'am better . Does Gordon learn after this ? No ! Gordon will always place second against the Winchester boys . The real story for ' Blood Lust ' is the story of the two brothers dependence on each other . I found the crux of the story is where Sam and Dean learn / grow from each others character flaws . The flat character Gordon who is hateful is a contrast of what the Winchesters are not . . Gordon should have just left the Winchesters alone .
402976	453228	890836	9.0	Sam and Dean	My wife love this episode . There is many ' The Shinning ' references for this show IE room 237 . The story is about a ghost who formally lived there , and the destruction of anyone who tries to destroy the old inn . The drunk Sam part show ' Sam's pain and a softer side of Dean taken care of them . The old door man add a lot of humor , and asks Dean if he is going go cheepo on him for a tip . A bar scene with Dean is similar to the Loyd the bartender in ' The Shinning ' . The two girls in the ending remind me of the shinning also . Plaything is a tribute to the above mention movie . Grandma save the day for the movie while Sam and Dean are left wondering how the problem resolved . A surprise ending . I give the brother a tie on this hunt . Yes the dolls are creepy . They were mistaken for a couple in this show instead of brothers .
403159	453228	125454	9.0	cute bird	Spoiler This is a great film about a conure . He goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner . He learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds . If you love birds like my wife does , this film is for you . This film also has some sad parts that make the tears run . In the end it all works out for Paulie and his Russian friend . Rent this for the whole family , everyone will enjoy this .
403098	453228	101540	9.0	Powerful film	This is one of Martin's better films . Powerful , I have seen the original and he modernized this film . The character become believable . Nick Nolte is a guy who makes mistakes , and faces a moral judgement when defending a client , and his character has the resolve to do what he did . Robert De Niro is evil , some people's main personality traits can simply be described as evil . I like the part where he studies Neitch , a major personality trait of his being . His 14 years in prison were only training in education , philosophy , exercise , and the art of war . Equally evil as when he entered prison , but even more dangerous when he left . I understand the frustration he felt working in a little 4 by 4 sortation case at the post office , when they show the scene of him being frustrated in his cell waiting to be unleashed . He plays the art of psychological warfare , and slowly turns the violence up . The private eye character is great , and the only expert to handle him . In the end , Nolte's actions lead to his character's fate . Chaos theory
402720	453228	118040	10.0	This film is unforgettable	This film is unforgettable , and I give it a 10 . This is a murder mystery with a twist where the man who needs his name cleared tries a experimental drug which gives the user other peoples memories . A lot better than Matlock , seen it done it before story line . Quite the surprise ending , and watching the drug's affects make me cringe . Rent this one .
403157	453228	107048	10.0	Funny all the way through	Not many comedies keep their momentum all the way through , but this one does . I laughed at this movie until the end , and I gave it a 10 . No mater how many times I watch it or know the jokes ahead of time I still laugh . This film is like a old joke that never goes stale . Well written , by SCTV's Harold Ramius , this film brings a fresh approach to comedy . Bill Murrey is the best sort of jerk type guy for the role of a individual who has to live the same day over until he gets it right . Buy this one !
402749	453228	88763	10.0	Great movie	One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86 . The film blew my mind . My friends never wanted to see this one . I was happy I went . Many year's latter , I bought " Back to the Future " at Mc Donalds for $2 . 99 or for some other low price with a meal . The film ages well , and I love it just the same . The director and screen writer mixes science fiction , humor , and action perfectly . A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story . Marty has many problems to fix , and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents . Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted . Marty and Doc what a chemistry . With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel , that become a constant with the movie . The town clock , being awoke in a strange place , and letters . Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels . The theory that time repeats itself is evident . What a time machine , the Delorian adds to this movie . Worth watch over again . ! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films .
402782	453228	335345	10.0	The best movie so far this year .	Spoilers So far , this year is a bad year for movies . Until The Passion of the Christ came out this year is the most forgettable for movies . This movie is a 10 because it is made so well . Directing , acting , lighting etc . If the viewer never understood Roman corporal and capital punishment they will after seeing this film . I pray the Rosary , and Tuesdays and Fridays meditations is on the crucifixion , and I believe this is where Gibson bases this film on . The viewer better understands the sacrifice Jesus made for man , and the trials and events that unfold during Good Friday . This film is directed exceptionally well , if one did not read the sub-titles they could still follow the story because of the pace and direction of Gibson's film . Is it realistic ? Yes very much like the meditations themselves . Should everyone see it ? No not young kids . Will it win any awards ? It should win best picture but leftwing Hollywood would never politically do this . The realism of Gibsons interpretations is helped with great details . The guard whos heart changes , after Jesus heals him . The brutal guards enjoy their work , one can understand why these guards where chosen for this job . They do it so well they get into trouble for over doing it . Judas anxiety is believable . These minor details give this film creditability . The location is excellent ; I wish too visit this town one day . Pilots handling the situation is shown extremely well , Pilot has the best performance of the show . I know that I understand the crucifiction better after viewing this film .
402526	453228	68646	10.0	perfect	This movie is strong , good script , great casting , excellent acting , and over the top directing . It is hard to fine a movie done this well , it is 29 years old and has aged well . Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies , he or she will watch the entire film , the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses . Its about , family , loyalty , greed , relationships , and real life . This is a great mix , and the artistic style make the film memorable .
402882	453228	88247	10.0	Arnie's best	This film is a sci-fi classic . The story is about time lines and how one event affects another . This film is great . I like the idea of the machines and if you watch closely , one sees Arnold's movements become mechanical , especially in the bar scene . I heard the idea came from and old Outer Limits episode , from the early 60's , starring Lenord Neymod ( Spock ) as the robot . In the end , the circle is complete and the flashbacks , or flash forward melt into the present . This film is a classic , and watch for the cameo appearance of Bill Paxton .
