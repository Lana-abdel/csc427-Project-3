419086	1609079	72546	1.0	As Italian as Chico Marx , but not as funny .	The enormous success of ' All in the Family ' inevitably spawned a flurry of imitations . ' The Montefuscos ' - - created by Persky and Denoff , both of whom had done excellent work on ' The Dick Van Dyke Show ' - - was an attempt at an Italian-American version of the Bunker mentality , as in Archie Bunker . Instead of Archie , the paterfamilias here was Tony Montefusco . He is the absolute boss in his home ( I feel sorry for his wife ) , but of course there are - - as in so many Yank sitcoms - - those usual " Awwww " moments which hint that , deep down , Tony is just an old softy . For some reason , it seems to be permissible on American television to invoke ethnic stereotypes providing the stereotypes are favourable . So , here we avoid the negative Italian stereotypes but we get all the positive ones : they have huge families , they love to eat , they quarrel among themselves but stick up for each other , yadda yadda . At this point in his life , Tony's children have mostly grown and flown the coop ( understandably ) , but they've given him young grandchildren . So , in every episode , we have the big Sunday evening sit-down dinner of the whole Montefusco clan at Tony's house . ( I feel sorry for his wife , who has to do all the cooking beforehand , all the serving during , and all the wash-up afterward . ) Tony's daughter Angela has married . . . which would be fine with Tony , except that Angela has committed the unpardonable sin of marrying a man who ( gasp ! ) is not an Italian . He isn't even Catholic ! Angela's husband is Jim Cooney , a bland and hapless schlub who is Episcopalian , a fact which scandalises Tony . He constantly addresses his son-in-law as ' Cooney ' and refers to him contemptuously as ' my Episcopalian son-in-law ' . Meanwhile , anything Tony's wife has to say about this situation doesn't count . . . because she's an Italian wife , which ( in this sitcom , at least ) means she should shut up and stay in the kitchen , except when she's serving food . Jim Cooney is constantly depicted as the family's jerk : apparently Episcopalians are the only minority group whom it's safe to ridicule . This sitcom was horribly unfunny , which ( I hope ) explains why it didn't last very long . I found it offensive , not so much because it gleefully perpetrated ethnic stereotypes , but rather because it seemed to think that it was celebrating the richness of Italian-American culture . This show was about as Italian as Chico Marx , but not remotely as funny . Basta !
418938	1609079	15087	1.0	After you , Alphonse . . .	' Love and Glory ' was directed by Rupert Julian , whose best-known credit is the silent version of ' The Phantom of the Opera ' , starring Lon Chaney . But Chaney and Julian quarrelled very bitterly during production of that film : Julian was ultimately dismissed from the set , and Chaney took over the direction himself . . . with an uncredited assist by Edward Sedgewick . Rupert Julian's reputation is based entirely on one highly regarded film ( ' Phantom of the Opera ' ) which he largely didn't direct . ' Love and Glory ' is probably a better indication of his talents . This movie is very bad indeed . This is one of those films that take place in two time periods several decades apart . In the 1860s , a regiment of Zouaves ( French infantry ) are fighting in Algeria . For some stupid reason , Anatole Picard has brought along his wife Gabrielle , played by Madge Bellamy with an elaborate marcel hairdo that immediately types her as a 1920s actress . When gabby Gabbie ( she gets plenty of dialogue in the intertitles ) wanders off and gets captured by the riffraff Riffs , Anatole and his buddy Pierre leave their regiment and go looking for her . They find Gabrielle in the encampment of local warlord Karim Bey , but now they get captured too . ( C'est le guerre , oui ? ) Discovering that Anatole is the regiment's trumpeter , the Bey ( a stereotypically stupid swarthy foreigner ) orders him to bring forth his trumpet and blow the call for retreat so that his regiment will go home . Of course , Anatole blows a charge instead . ( This is clumsily depicted in the silent-film intertitles . ) When Anatole gives his horn a sweet toot , the Zouave regiment come rushing into view , toot sweet . Sacre bleu ! Gabrielle and lucky Pierre are rescued , but Anatole dies in action . Vive le France ! Fade in fifty years onward , during the days of the Great War . Pierre and Gabrielle ( now much older ) are living in the French village of Mirabel , which is lately overrun with German schweinhunds , I mean soldiers . From this point , the movie degenerates into a sluggish examination of honour , courage , truth and beauty . Madge Bellamy looks utterly ludicrous in old-age makeup , and Charles de Roche ( as Pierre ) looks very nearly as bad . Ford Sterling ( the silent film era's equivalent of Harvey Korman ) overacts outrageously as the French mayor who must appease the German invaders . Gibson Gowland is much more impressive in a too-small role . Rupert Julian shows here how bad a director he was . There are long , long , long stretches in which a single actor ( usually Madge Bellamy ) is kept in close-up , relieved only by long speechy intertitles . Julian should have learnt from the example of William Wellman , who always used close-ups only very sparingly for maximum emotional impact . Also , Julian should have studied Wellman's action sequences : in ' Love and Glory ' , the battle scenes in 19th-century Algeria are ludicrously bad , and the modern-day battle sequence ( German shock troops versus French poilus ) is utterly unconvincing . I'll rate ' Love and Glory ' precisely .
418278	1609079	368818	1.0	Julie Andrews kisses herself .	Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were so brilliant together in ' Mary Poppins ' ( in spite of his wretched faux-Cockney accent ) that it's a shame they don't recapture that chemistry here . This very weak variety special is directed by Andrews's long-time husband Blake Edwards . Despite their long happy marriage , Andrews and Edwards have done their best work separately : Edwards has made some brilliant films - - including ' The Great Race ' , one of my all-time favourite comedies - - but he's never done a good job of directing Julie Andrews , and she always comes off as lacklustre under his direction . London's Covent Garden district ( on the site of a long-ago convent , hence its name ) has a deep and rich history , being for many decades the site of an open market specialising in produce and flowers . Alfred Hitchcock's father , a poulterer , maintained a stall in Covent Garden Market , and Hitchcock set much of his film ' Frenzy ' there , filming in authentic locations . More recently , Covent Garden has been a centre for opera and high culture . George Bernard Shaw knew what he was doing when he set the opening scene of ' Pygmalion ' in Covent Garden : a natural place for Londoners of the upper and the lower classes to cross paths . It's a shame that almost none of that atmosphere is conveyed in ' Julie and Dick at Covent Garden ' , which appears to have been filmed on indoor sets with rather obvious actors substituting for authentic stallmen . Dick Van Dyke is nearly bowled over by a barrow boy who tells him ' Mind your plates ! ' This prompts Julie Andrews to give Van Dyke a lesson in Cockney rhyming-slang : ' plates ' ( short for ' plates of meat ' ) is slang for ' feet ' , and so forth . Eventually , Julie and Dick meet the Ghost of Drury Lane , who has somehow arrived in Covent Garden . This ' ghost ' is played by Carl Reiner , kitted out in elaborate Elizabethan garb with a peccadillo ruff . There's some very unimpressive trick photography as Reiner passes through a solid wall , and Andrews puts her hand through his ghostly body . Then , for no discernible reason , all three of them sing ' Consider Yourself ' from ' Oliver ! ' , marching in place , with Reiner looking utterly ridiculous in his Shakespearean cozzy alongside Andrews and Van Dyke in normal clothing . But then it gets worse . Julie tells Dick about Britain's tradition of pantomime comedies , in which the male hero ( the ' principal boy ' ) is played by a woman in tight-fitting trousers , while the ' dame ' is played by a male comedian in drag . This is the cue for a painfully bad tab-show version of ' Cinderella ' , in which Andrews plays the dual role of Cinderella and Prince Charming , with some very clumsy editing for the scene in which the male Julie Andrews kisses the female Julie Andrews . Even worse is the depiction of the Ugly Stepsisters , played by Van Dyke and Reiner in horrible drag , with elaborate Marie Antoinette wigs and polonaise gowns . Oh , blimey ! It's a shame that these talented performers got stuck doing this rubbish . I'll rate it just .
418514	1609079	309279	1.0	Skip this documentary , watch the episodes instead	" Amos ' n ' Andy " was a phenomenally popular American radio programme , transmitting five days a week from 1929 to 1960 ! Although this was a comedy series , Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll ( the actors who wrote the scripts and played all the male voices ) had the brilliant idea of using serialised plotlines which continued from one episode to the next . Often , the Friday episode would end with a cliffhanger . . . keeping the show's huge listening audience on tenterhooks over the weekend . Nearly all the characters in " Amos ' n ' Andy " were Negroes ( this being the accepted term at the time ) . Gosden and Correll , who were white , performed the black characters ' voices in a broad minstrel-show dialect with heavy reliance on malapropisms and catchphrases such as " Amos , I'se regusted " . Amos ' n ' Andy made a few half-hearted movie appearances ( featuring Gosden and Correll in blackface ) , but these were never remotely as popular as the radio series . For the transition to television , producers Gosden and Correll wisely hired a talented cast of black actors to play their characters . Filmed at the Hal Roach studio in California , the tv show " Amos ' n ' Andy " originally aired on CBS from June 1951 to June ' 53 and was a huge hit , but was yanked off the air under tremendous pressure from the NAACP . " Amos ' n ' Andy " was also the very first American sitcom to air in Britain , where the BBC televised it fortnightly from April 1954 to September 1957 . My stepfather has told me of the great interest which this programme aroused in the mid-1950s among British televiewers , both white and black . Eventually , social pressure led to the 78 television kinescopes of " Amos ' n ' Andy " being suppressed for more than 20 years . Was " Amos ' n ' Andy " racist ? The dialogue and situations in the tv series were slightly more realistic than the ( much cruder ) radio version . To its credit , this tv series gave steady employment to some talented African-American actors . Several of my black friends ( in America and England ) , have told me nostalgic tales of how their families eagerly watched this show because ( in the 1950s ) it was the only tv programme that showed black men and women who weren't servants . The Negro characters in " Amos ' n ' Andy " were businessmen , homeowners and housewives , not shoeshine boys or mammies . ( In one episode , Kingfish quotes the Wall Street Journal . ) The characters in " Amos ' n ' Andy " had unfavourable traits , but they were no worse than white sitcom characters such as Gilligan , Eddie Haskell or Ralph Kramden . In fact , the Raccoon Lodge ( in ' The Honeymooners ' ) is clearly inspired by the Mystic Knights of the Sea , the fraternal lodge that inspired so many " Amos ' n ' Andy " episodes . Andy's friend Amos Jones was definitely a positive role model : a hard-working cab driver , a loving husband and father . But these positive traits made him a poor figure for comedy plotlines . In the radio series , Amos ( voiced by Gosden ) was a major character . . . yet when this sitcom moved to television , Amos ( now played by black actor Alvin Childress ) was demoted to a mere narrator , speaking into the camera at the start of each episode to describe the antics of the more rascally Andy and his lodge brother the Kingfish . " Amos ' n ' Andy : Anatomy of a Controversy " was a tv documentary produced in 1986 , timed to mark the release of the tv show's 78 episodes to video . This documentary's television format is painfully obvious : there are crude gaps for commercial breaks every few minutes . The onscreen narrator is George Kirby , a very talented African-American actor who had no connexion to the original series , but whose comedy style is firmly in that vaudeville tradition . In the first half of this hour-long programme , he gives us a rundown of the tv series , its actors , and the social controversy . Annoyingly , we see NO clips from any of the episodes , nor any interview footage of anyone connected with the tv series . We DO get some irrelevant soundbites from a few black celebrities who offer their opinions of the tv show . . . but these are only opinions , from people who have no direct link to the series . For the second half of this documentary , Kirby announces that we will now see an episode of " Amos ' n ' Andy " in its entirety : shown on tv for the first time in more than 20 years ! We see the episode in which the Kingfish sells Andy a house . . . but the ' house ' is actually a flat backdrop left over from a recent movie shoot . It looks good from the front and the back , but it's only half an inch thick . When Andy walks through the front door , he finds himself standing in the back garden ! " Amos ' n ' Andy : Anatomy of a Controversy " served a useful purpose in 1986 , when most people had heard of this notorious tv series but nobody had seen it for many years . Now that all 78 episodes are available on video , we can make up our minds without this documentary . I'll rate " Anatomy of a Controversy " 1 point out of 10 . Here's a trivia note which you WON'T learn from this documentary : Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher , the headwriters of the " Amos ' n ' Andy " tv show , later created ' Leave It to Beaver ' . . . a series which was a lot less funny than " Amos ' n ' Andy " .
418765	1609079	80738	1.0	' Deadly ' doesn't begin to describe it .	Lawrence Sanders wrote a series of novels about NYPD detective Edward Delaney ; popular in their day , they have not remained in print . Sanders actually gave them sequential titles : ' The First Deadly Sin ' , ' The Second Deadly Sin ' , ' The Third Deadly Sin ' . The series died before Sanders ran out of sins . Frank Sinatra was occasionally an inspired actor , although always an undisciplined one . ( He snagged the great lead role of Billy Bigelow in the film version of ' Carousel ' - - Sinatra would have been brilliant in this part - - but then dropped it when he learnt that the film was going to be shot in two different screen ratios , and he would have been required to do all his scenes twice . ) Sinatra's Academy Award for ' From Here to Eternity ' was well-deserved , and in my opinion he should have got an Oscar for ' Von Ryan's Express ' too , and possibly for ' Suddenly ' . However , Sinatra apparently ran out of energy ( and talent ) before he made the movie version of ' The First Deadly Sin ' . This was Sinatra's last starring performance ; apparently he'd planned to develop a franchise series based on Sanders's novels , but this movie was such a clanging flop that no sequels were made . Two later friends of mine had worked ( before I knew them ) on the crew of this film ; they've told me that the production was a nightmare , plagued by wrong-headed decisions . Delaney ( Sinatra ) is hunting a serial killer while Delaney's wife ( Faye Dunaway ) struggles with cancer . These two plots never interlink , nor does Sinatra convey any sense of a man torn between two priorities . He just shuttles ( in slow motion ) between police procedural sequences and hospital sequences . The killer is known to the audience , so it's no spoiler when I tell you that the murderer is Daniel Blank , a wealthy playboy who has no particular motive for killing random Manhattanites : he just kills ' em for the hell of it . With an ice axe , no less . The killer is played by David Dukes , who filmed his scenes in Manhattan concurrently while starring on Broadway in ' Bent ' , in which he played an inmate of a concentration camp . Dukes's head was shaved to a tight crew cut for his stage role , but this coiffure was inappropriate for his film role as a murderous playboy , so Dukes plays his scenes in a hairpiece . Which would have been fine , if the film chose not to call attention to the hairpiece . Instead , we get a stupid sequence in which Dukes's hairpiece flies off while he sinks the axe into a victim's skull . Then we get a bad dialogue scene later , explaining why the playboy has a crew cut and why he wears a wig to cover it . Hell toupee . My friends on the film crew told me that the wig fell off by accident , and then the dialogue was inserted so they wouldn't have to shoot a retake . Frankly , Dukes's performance quite fails to impress me : given the handicap of his inappropriate hairstyle , the casting agent should have chosen another actor ( with more hair ) instead . We get an utterly pointless scene in which Sinatra swots up evidence with two civilian volunteers , of the sort whom real police call ' cop groupies ' . One of the volunteers is played by Martin Gabel , an American actor who spoke with a pronounced mid-Atlantic accent . ( In real life , Gabel described himself as ' affected ' . ) Gabel's accent was useful in some other roles , but here it's just distracting . SPOILERS COMING . Sinatra's ( very slow ) race to find the killer occurs during the week before Christmas , but this has nothing to do with the plot . And the film was shot in late summer , worse luck . ( The exterior scenes in this movie show very little snow . ) As New Yorkers know , every year during Christmas season - - and only during Christmas season - - the Empire State Building's upper floors are lighted green and red . While ' The First Deadly Sin ' was shooting principal photography , Sinatra's production company paid some bucks to Helmsley-Spear ( the Empire State Building's landlords ) to wire up the Christmas lighting a few months ahead of schedule . This would have been a very effective device for an exterior shot of Sinatra in midtown Manhattan at night , with the Empire State Building glowing green and red in the background . Instead , after all that trouble , we merely get one quick insert shot of the Empire State Building's upper storeys , lighted in the appropriate colour scheme but with no surroundings - - no context - - at all . This shot occurs immediately before the death scene . Ouch ! The death scene . After nabbing the killer , Delaney goes to visit his wife in hospital . This scene is beyond awful . Sinatra reads aloud from an old-time children's book about two little girls named Sunny and Honey . He reads this awful text in a voice so lethargic , he seems to be on meds . Dunaway remains utterly inert through this scene , at the end of which Sinatra realises she's dead . Of boredom , most likely . Fade out . I sat through this rubbish only because I know two people who worked on the tech crew . I'll rate ' The First Deadly Sin ' just one point in ten .
418440	1609079	8372	1.0	Lost but no loss , Stan Laurel's bicorn-y debut .	Some footage from ' Nuts in May ' ( 1917 ) - - Stan Laurel's very first movie - - was salvaged five years on and edited into ' Mixed Nuts ' , another of Laurel's pre-Hardy comedies ( from a different production company ) , but ' Nuts in May ' in its original form almost certainly no longer survives . The obscure production company that made ' Mixed Nuts ' obtained clear title to ' Nuts in May ' ( from an even more obscure production company ) , and had no interest in letting any prints of the previous movie compete with their revised version . ' Nuts in May ' was a right one-off : the one and only film ever made by the Bernstein Studio , an independent endeavour which produced and released just this lone one-reeler before going out of business . Sam Bischoff - - the producer of ' Mixed Nuts ' , and a notorious tightwad - - bought ' Nuts in May ' at a bailiff's auction . In the last years of his life , I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock , a Hollywood old-timer who knew Stan Laurel intimately . ( Besides working with Stan Laurel , Rock introduced him to Lois Neilson , and Rock was subsequently best man at their wedding . ) Although Joe Rock didn't work on ' Nuts in May ' , he remembered the film and told me quite a bit about it . This synopsis of ' Nuts in May ' is based on Joe Rock's memories ( still clear as he approached his ninetieth birthday ) and my viewing of ' Mixed Nuts ' . Stan plays a resident of a " Home for the Weak-Minded " , apparently a lunatic asylum . There are several gags depicting the inmates ' bizarre behaviour . Stan's particular delusion is that he thinks he's Napoleon . ( Is there even one genuine case on record of anyone - - besides Bonaparte himself - - actually believing that he or she was Napoleon ? ) Stan walks the grounds of the cuckoo-hatch sticking his right hand into his shirt ( ha ha ) and wearing a Napoleonic hat . ( Memo to IMDb reviewer Bob Lipton : Napoleon's hat was a bicorn , not a tricorn . And how does Mr Lipton know that Stan is wearing a ' blue ' blazer in this monochrome movie ? ) Stan salutes everybody , including the other lunatics . He thinks he's Napoleon , but he gives the salute of the British army . Stan has his own personal keeper in the asylum : a taller moustached man who wears a kepi so that Stan will think he's a French officer . French soldiers ( and gendarmes ) didn't wear kepis until after Napoleon's death . . . but don't mind me ; I just work here . Stan gets out and finds some local boys , who eagerly join him in playing soldier . Stan's kepi-wearing keeper pursues him through the film , but at a lethargic pace . Stan hijacks a steamroller ( when did Napoleon ever drive a steamroller ? ) , and there's some unfunny undercranking as Stan nearly runs down some navvies in a road crew . In the surviving footage , the photography's bad and the pacing is awful . Stan Laurel's performance gives no hint of the brilliance to come . Indeed , right up until his team-up with Oliver Hardy ( apparently Hal Roach's idea ) , Laurel on the screen was just one more frenetic comedian , not necessarily imitating Chaplin but working the same trough of knockabout humour with little or nothing to distinguish him from other slapstickers . Joe Rock did tell me that ' Nuts in May ' was financed by Los Angeles impresario Adolph Ramish , who paid Stan Laurel the astounding wage of $75 to appear in it . Ramish screened ' Nuts in May ' at the L . A . Hippodrome , where it was seen by Carl Laemmle . . . not yet the major producer he would later become . Apparently Laemmle liked ' Nuts in May ' enough to sign Laurel to a contract with Nestor Film Company , one of the lesser satellites in the Universal Studios planetary system . However , from what I've seen of Stan Laurel's time at Universal , his work there was not especially funny . He really didn't come into his own until he arrived at Hal Roach's studio . . . where Laurel distinguished himself as a director and gag man as well as a comedian before teaming with Hardy . Purely for its historic value , it would be nice if a complete print of Stan Laurel's film debut eventually turns up in some forgotten bailiff's locker . However , the photography would be wretched even if the print were pristine . Stan Laurel was brilliant elsewhere , but not in the surviving footage of ' Nuts in May ' . And I'm positive that none of the ' lost ' scenes contain some nugget of hilarity : if something funny had been in there , Sam Bischoff would have included it in ' Mixed Nuts ' . I normally don't rate films I've never seen ( quiet in the back , there ! ) , but I feel confident that ' Nuts in May ' merits just 1 point in 10 , and an asterisk in film history for Stan Laurel paying his dues .
418542	1609079	146367	1.0	Did he say ' mer ' or ' merde ' ?	I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention . Apart from his Rayographs ( which he invented by accident , and which are merely direct-contact photo prints ) , his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn . But surely this had to happen eventually , and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit . The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes . " L'Étoile de merde " . . . whoops , " de mer " . . . features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish , which is never explained . Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - - and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies - - but , if that has anything to do with this movie's theme , Ray neglects to say so . I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards , which ( in French ) manage to include rhymes , a pun ( ' Si belle , Cybele ' ) and some portmanteaux . As so often in Ray's work , there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie . Unfortunately , the photography is ( largely ) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her . I'll rate this mess .
418890	1609079	30468	2.0	. . . but not as kicked-off as I am .	If you actually want to know anything about Joe Penner , there's substantial information about him in my IMDb review of his alleged comedy ' The Day the Bookies Wept ' , which is a poor film but a much better ( and funnier ) movie than this one . ' Mr Doodle Kicks Off ' is utterly execrable . First , an inglorious moment in sport history : in the 1929 Rose Bowl football match ( California v . Georgia Tech ) , a California player ball-carrier named Roy Riegels ran 65 yards the wrong way , and scored the winning touchdown against his own team . This incident remained a big joke for years afterward , and was parodied ( or imitated ) in many Hollywood films . One of the first movies to make fun of Riegels's football faux-pas was Frank Capra's ' Flight ' . In my IMDb review of ' Flight ' , I made several errors . . . including misspelling Riegels's name . As my punishment for being naughty , I'm now reviewing ' Mr Doodle Kicks Off ' , which borrows the same Riegels incident as Capra's movie . It will come as no surprise to you that Frank Capra's film is a much better movie than ' Mr Doodle Kicks Off ' . Joe Penner , unfunny and whiny with it , plays a jerk named Doodle Bugs . That name might have been amusing in America in 1938 . In Britain , where hundreds of people were killed by doodlebugs during the Blitz , I fail to see the joke . Doodle's dad is named Ellery Bugs , a name which I do find funny . . . slightly . Ellery has his heart set on his son attending his alma mater Taylor Tech . . . not for reasons of academia , but to become a football star . This is one of those brainless Hollywood movies in which colleges exist only as support systems for a football team . Actually , I can think of several real colleges like that . SPOILERS A-GO-GO : Ellery Bugs , who has more money than any man named Ellery Bugs has a right to possess , offers a whacking big endowment to the dean of the college if Doodle becomes a gridiron great . The college's dean has no discernible forename , but his surname is Martin , so he must be Dean Martin . That joke is funnier than anything in this movie . Still here ? It gets worse . It's too late for me , but you can go surf the X-rated websites and leave me here in my agony . Doodle Bugs is , of course , a total failure at footy . Among other things , he has an irresistible compulsion to start dancing whenever he hears ' Pop Goes the Weasel ' . If memory serves , Curly of the Three Stooges had a similar compulsion triggered by precisely the same song : I think Joe Penner did this gag first , but it was definitely funnier when the Stooges did it . The financial endowment offered by Ellery Bugs is dependent upon his son becoming a football star , so it looks like Ellery's moolah is safe . Or maybe not . Dean Martin ( the one in this movie ) is determined to get his hands on Ellery's huge endowment ( the one in his wallet ) , so he decides to improve Doodle's football abilities by pimping his own daughter . ( This man is a college dean , remember . ) The dean sends his lovely daughter Janice to diddle with Doodle , which sounds like a doddle but gets deadly dull because Doodle is a dud . Nonetheless , this mess is a brainless 1930s comedy , so Janice's phony affection makes Doodle believe that she's really in love with him , and somehow this inspires Doodle to become a genuinely excellent football player . ( No comment . ) The climax of the film is , of course , the Big Game . But when Doodle learns that Janice's ' love ' for him was just a ploy , he loses all his previous brilliance . He runs the wrong way on the field ( Roy Riegels should have sued ) , and of course somebody strikes up ' Pop Goes the Weasel ' at the worst possible moment . Guess who wins the game anyway . Guess who decides she really loves Doodle after all . Guess who doesn't give a damn . I'll rate this rubbish , purely for its supporting cast . Billy Gilbert is perfectly cast as a pompous Greek master , but his welcome presence is too brief and doesn't save this movie . Jack Carson and Ben Alexander are good as Doodle's teammates . As the college dean , George Irving gives a good performance in a badly-written and very unlikeable role . May I go home now , mistress ?
418879	1609079	171769	2.0	Toothless comedy	It's an odd coincidence that England's two most famous Northern comedians - - George Formby and Frank Randle - - were both from the small town of Wigan , Lancashire . ( Stan Laurel was born in Lancashire too , but I consider him an American comedian : Laurel's comedic style was English but not especially ' Northern ' . In ' Way out West ' , he even claims to have been born south of London . ) George Formby's thick Lancashire dialect never impaired his popularity in southern England . . . but Frank Randle was always a Northern commodity , whose appeal was distinctly limited south of the Midlands . Randle was a physically unappealing man , whose humour dealt heavily in sexual innuendo and broad vulgarity . He was an influence on Benny Hill . . . but Benny's sexual humour was always cheeky , whilst frankly randy Frank Randle's was extremely raunchy . ( Max Miller , England's most famous ' blue ' comedian , was more suggestive than either of them . ) A typical gag from Randle's music-hall act : he would come out onstage and start to speak a few words in his broad Lancashire dialect , but would seem to have difficulty . He beckoned into the wings , giving the cue for a shapely showgirl in a scanty costume to come onstage bearing a satin pillow . Randle would then ostentatiously take out his dentures ( full plates , upper and lower ) and place them with great ceremony on the pillow . The showgirl would curtsey , turn and exit while Randle leered at her backside . Then he faced the audience again and resumed his monologue , staying utterly toothless for the rest of his turn . Offstage , Randle was legendary for his violent arguments with theatre managers , and for his bizarre behaviour which often bordered on mental illness . The stories told about Randle's offstage behaviour are much more interesting than the unfunny and vulgar routines he performed in his music-hall act . In the 1940s , Frank Randle starred in a few cheapjack comedy movies for the Mancunian Film Corporation . As that name indicates , Mancunian's film studio was based in Manchester , and their movie output was distributed almost entirely to cinemas in northern England . Very seldom did a Mancunian film get screened south of the Midlands , north of the Tweed or west of Shrewsbury . These were ' quota quickies ' , ground out to meet the British law requiring a minimum quota of films exhibited in Britain's cinemas to be British-made regardless of quality . ' Somewhere in Civvies ' is absolutely typical of Frank Randle's output , although it has a slightly better cast than usual . . . largely due to veteran character actor H . F . Maltby , whose superb comedy timing and distinctive appearance ( walrus moustache , spectacles , quivering chin ) are wasted in these trivial doings . The funniest joke in this movie ( and one that's absolutely typical of Frank Randle's comedy style ) occurs when Randle , as an army private , turns out for parade mounted on a ' moke ' : a small donkey of the sort usually employed for giving rides to children at the seaside . Maltby , as Randle's commanding officer , spots the donkey and demands to know what Randle is doing . Randle replies : " I'm sitting on my ass , sir ! " If you fancy this sort of humour , then I recommend this movie . If not , not . I'll rate ' Somewhere in Civvies ' ( and the entire Frank Randle oeuvre ) . I'm tempted to rate it only one point , but Randle was genuinely a major name during the golden era of English music-hall comedy .
419445	1609079	10469	2.0	Billie's billets	Billie Burke , in real life the wife of Florenz Ziegfeld , is now remembered only for putting a wastebasket on her head to play Glinda the fairy . As so few people have seen her in other roles , it's not widely realised that Burke's Glinda routine was no act : she went through her entire career with that annoying twittery voice and those fluttery gestures . Fortunately , ' The Misleading Widow ' is a silent film , so we're spared the ordeal of her twittering tonsils . Although this film was made in America with a Yank cast , the action is set in an English village near a British army base . . . which is just as well , because this story couldn't happen in America . It deals with the compulsory billeting of soldiers in civilian homes , which is lawful in Britain but specifically proscribed in America by the Third Amendment . Betty Taradine ( Burke ) is one of the women of the village : ostensibly a widow , the truth is that her husband abandoned her years ago under scandalous circumstances . The village women have been gossiping about her . Now , during the Great War , Colonel Preedy arrives and informs Mrs Taradine that she is required by law to billet one of Preedy's officers - - his aide-de-camp - - in her home . When the aide-de-camp arrives , he turns out to be Mrs Taradine's long-lost husband , who has changed his name and is now an army captain calling himself Peter Rymill . But Mrs Taradine is not best pleased to have her husband back , as she has declared him dead so she can collect on his life insurance . She and her ( late ? ) husband maintain the charade so that she doesn't get nicked for fraud . It turns out that the reason why he walked out in the first place was because his wife was irresponsible with money . Despite collecting the insurance , she's still irresponsible , and she hasn't paid her bills in months . Mrs Taradine's electricity and telephone service are about to get shut off , and the grocery deliveries have stopped . In order to be able to live comfortably while he's billeted at his wife's house , Captain Rymill pays her bills himself , without letting on that he's her husband . Now the villagers have really got something to gossip about : why is this army officer paying Mrs Taradine's bills for her ? Hmmm . . . I found this movie moderately amusing , but the painful memory of Billie Burke's twittery voice is so deeply burnt into my brain that I kept cringing every time she spoke any dialogue in this silent movie , even though I couldn't actually hear her . I'll rate this movie just .
419622	1609079	20781	2.0	' Common Clay ' is merely mud	' Common Clay ' is based on an old stage play , and it shows . The action is creaky and stagebound , and the highly contrived final revelation relies on an extremely heavy coincidence which comes with an even heavier moral . Ellen Neal ( Constance Bennett , the least attractive of the three Bennett sisters ) is established as a ' bad girl ' who is more sinned against than sinning . We first see her working in a speakeasy , yet it's clear that she has few options . When the speakeasy is raided and Ellen is hauled off to court , Judge Filson advises her to associate with a better class of people . As in ' An Inspector Calls ' , it turns out here that the ' better ' classes are morally no better than the common people , and in fact are even worse . ( This hasn't been my own experience , I hasten to add . ) Ellen gets a job as a maid in the respectable household of the Fullertons . All is well until their handsome son Hugh comes home from college . His eyes meet Ellen's , and we know what's going to happen . Ellen is honest enough to let Hugh know about her spotty past , but it's not her past that he's interested in . Pretty soon Ellen has a bun in the oven , courtesy of the college boy . A year later , when Ellen shows up with a baby which she claims is Hugh's love-child , Hugh's father suspects a shakedown . To protect his family , he orders his attorney Yates to ruin Ellen's reputation , such as it is . Yates , the lawyer , is played by veteran character actor Tully Marshall in a Smith Brothers beard , which makes him the only actor in this cast who has something to hide behind . SPOILER COMING RIGHT NOW . Enter the twist ending , upstage left , dragging its coincidences across the script . Tully Marshall was a brilliant actor , but here he's lumbered with tying up an implausible plotline . Are you ready ? Turns out that bad-girl Ellen is the daughter of respectable lawyer Yates ! When he was a young man , the same age as Hugh , he decided to sow his wild oats with a woman who loved him but whom he didn't choose to marry . When she gave birth to his daughter , she generously decided to raise the girl entirely by herself , instead of compelling Yates to marry her . . . so as not to stand in the way of Yates's promising career as a lawyer . Hoo boy to this , and the hoo-boy factor gets even worse because Ellen's martyr mother is played by Beryl Mercer , the single most annoying performer in the entire history of Hollywood . ( Film historian William K Everson agreed with me on this . ) Fortunately , Mercer's ' contribution ' to this particular movie is largely confined to one long scene . Elsewhere , Mercer has polluted dozens of good movies with her whines , her snivels , her tremblings , her whimpered begorrahs . The sure hand of director Victor Fleming guides this material about as ably as it can be done . ( Not much . ) I admire Constance Bennett for her work on behalf of the American military ( she is buried in Arlington National Cemetery ) , but her appeal as an actress has always eluded me . Her sisters Joan and Barbara were much sexier and more talented . ( Barbara Bennett was the mother of notorious chat-show host Morton Downey Jnr . ) ' Common Clay ' was a stage vehicle for Jane Cowl , an important stage actress of the early 20th century who made few films , and who is now forgotten . If this film had starred Cowl , it might at least have rated some historical significance as a record of her stage performance . Any movie that gives Tully Marshall a chance to shine is welcome , but he did much better work for Victor Fleming ( with much better material ) in ' Red Dust ' . Hale Hamilton is good in his brief role as the judge . Beryl Mercer needs her sinuses cleaned out . ( Among other things . ) I'll rate this bathetic sobfest just .
418856	1609079	20546	2.0	The princess should have drowned .	' Venus ' was made in France , but this movie fits squarely into the Italian film genre which has a name that translates into English as ' white telephone ' . A white-telephone movie is a film about superficial rich people who have plenty of leisure time , doing unimportant things in extremely swank surroundings . Princess Beatrice is the president of the Doriani Steamship Line . While cruising off the coast of Cyprus , she has a sudden yen to go water-skiing in a formal gown and string of pearls . ( As I said , this is a white-telephone movie . ) When she discovers that she's improperly dressed for water-skiing , she discards her gown but carries on in her pearls and her scanties . A sleazy passenger on the ship ( Maurice Schutz ) makes a lewd remark about this display in the presence of the ship's commanding officer , Captain Franqueville ( Charles Frank ) , who gallantly slaps the bounder . Said bounder promptly falls overboard . The captain duly lowers a lifeboat , but the cad drowns anyway . When the Princess learns that the captain has struck a passenger , indirectly causing the passenger's death , she promptly sacks Franqueville . . . not knowing that his action was in defence of her honour . ( Should that make a difference ? ) Later , in Cyprus , the Princess meets a handsome man and they're mutually attracted . But they don't know each other's names . Only when he expresses contempt for the name of Princess Beatrice Doriani for costing him his job does she realise that this is Captain Franqueville . Being deeply attracted to him , she decides to reveal her identity . . . but there's always a headwaiter , or some other interruption , to prevent this . ' Venus ' is painfully unfunny . A long series of deeply contrived interruptions prevent the princess from tipping her hand . It's very annoying at any time to watch characters behaving so frivolously and irresponsibly with so much wealth , but especially so in a movie made in 1929 , just a few months before the stock-market crash . The production budget might have been adequate for a story about middle-class characters , but is much too low for this story about conspicuous consumption and wealthy royalty . Some of the exterior sequences are well-photographed , especially the water-skiing sequence which requires a camera to keep moving at sea level without getting water on the lens . I never found Constance Talmadge especially beautiful , but her beauty here has faded considerably from her peak years . A more plausible script might have helped . I'll rate this movie .
418481	1609079	23498	2.0	Buster's heartbreaking decline	To be a Buster Keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis . Most of us first encounter Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production : ' The General ' , ' The Navigator ' , ' Sherlock Jnr ' . We recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy , and we want to see more of his movies . Here the heartbreak begins . After ' Steamboat Bill Jnr ' , Keaton's brother-in-law Joseph Schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put Keaton under the control of MGM . Keaton became just one more actor for hire , performing someone else's scripts . Then his alcoholism got worse . After ' Steamboat Bill Jnr ' , Keaton never again made a truly first-rate film . A couple of sources describe a would-be masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he almost got to make at MGM : a parody of ' Grand Hotel ' . Biographer Tom Dardis has offered convincing evidence that Keaton made up this story . The heartbreak increases because , among the many years of Keaton's long steady decline , he just occasionally came up with a good film . . . such as his short comedy ' Grand Slam Opera ' . I continue to search for the lost footage of Keaton's dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in ' It's a Mad Mad World ' : a sequence in which embittered cop Tracy telephones an old retired crook ( Keaton ) and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing Smiler Grogan's cash . That footage is almost certainly gone forever , but I keep looking . ' Speak Easily ' , alas , is one of Keaton's films from the beginning of his decline . MGM were trying to build up Jimmy Durante ( who , coincidentally , played Smiler Grogan three decades later ) as a new comedy star . Unfortunately , MGM tried to build up Durante by teaming him with Keaton , whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with Durante's . ( I'm a fan of both . ) Throughout his career , Durante was a merciless scene-stealer : commendably , he knew that he was being built up at Keaton's expense , and Keaton was the only co-star whom Durante never attempted to upstage . Keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations . In ' Speak Easily ' , he plays a didactic and humourless Midwestern college professor named Post ( because he's as wooden as one ) who receives a letter informing him that he's inherited $750 , 000 , which he must travel to New York City to claim . Does he make a ' phone call to verify this ? Does he even check the postmark ? No ; he takes his life's savings out of the bank and rushes to New York . As soon as he's gone , Post's manservant confesses that he wrote the ( fake ) letter to jostle Professor Post out of his rut ! Post , who thinks he's a - millionaire , crosses paths with Jimmy Dodge ( Durante ) , who's trying to produce a musical revue but hasn't any money . The characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh . Keaton is playing one of those eggheads ( like Mister Logic in ' Viz ' ) who intellectualises everything . Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang . There's a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money , but - instead of coming straight out with it - Durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like ' kale ' , ' cartwheels ' and so forth . . . while Keaton of course has no idea what Durante's on about . I'll give Keaton credit : his own dry and dusty prairie voice , his flat Kansas accent , is absolutely perfect for the character he's playing here . Sidney Toler , looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later , is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled ( on tick ) by Professor Post . Henry Armetta , whom I've never found funny , is even less funny than usual here , offering a running gag with a stupid payoff . Thelma Todd impressed me here , in a more villainous version of the role she played in ' Horse Feathers ' ( a much funnier movie ) . Edward Brophy , one of my favourite character actors , is wasted . Part of the problem with ' Speak Easily ' is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways . Keaton's lawyer shows up at Durante's theatre with an urgent message for Keaton . . . but he isn't there , so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keaton's personal business to the first total stranger he meets . ( Fire that lawyer , Buster ! ) In another scene , Professor Post - the guy who's perceived as bankrolling this musical - blunders into the chorus girls ' changing room , and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves . I know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way , and I seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either . . . certainly not in response to the ' angel ' controlling their show's pursestrings . SPOILERS COMING . About half an hour into the unfunny ' Speak Easily ' , the great Jimmy Durante seats himself at the piano , grins into the camera , and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune . This is the moment when I thought that , at long last , this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us . Alas , no . Most annoying of all is the ending of this film , which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy : the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude . ( Keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of ' Screen Directors Playhouse ' ; Chaplin had already used it in ' The Circus ' . ) I very nearly wept - in anger and sorrow - at the wasted opportunities in ' Speak Easily ' . Mostly out of respect for the work that Keaton , Durante , Toler , Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere , I'll rate this movie .
418565	1609079	193620	2.0	I'll bet Hitler loved this movie .	I saw this German documentary in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone , Italy . The festival screened a print from a German collection ( the FW Murnau archive in Wiesbaden ) that had English intertitles . According to the programme notes at Pordenone , in 1925 the failing German economy had forced a major decline in feature-film production ( I hadn't noticed ) , and an attendant increase in documentary movies ( again , I hadn't noticed ) , which were cheaper to produce . The programme notes also stated that this film was so popular upon its original release that it was re-released a year later in a new edition , with substantial new footage added and previous footage removed . I'm a bit surprised that it survived at all in its original version . ' The Way to Strength and Health : a film of modern body culture ' is very much an artefact of the Naturist fad that swept Germany at this time . It was part of the same trend which helped the Nazis come to power , with their obsession for racial and physical purity and the beauty of the German countryside . This isn't a Nazi movie , but it comes directly out of the same school of thought which facilitated the rise of Nazism . There's lots of footage of naked young bodies here , most of them German or at least ( by Nazi definition ) Aryan . I felt very uncomfortable watching these sequences , because I felt that they were somewhat dishonest . Audiences for this 1925 movie were fully-dressed and anonymous in the darkness , while watching adults ( and teens ) of both sexes who are naked , performing gymnastics and other physical rituals . I couldn't help wondering how much of this movie's original success was down to sexual prurience and voyeurism rather than a sincere interest in health and fitness . Lest I seem hypocritical , I freely admit that I felt very aroused indeed at the footage of the very sexy young Leni Riefenstahl in this movie . At this late date , this movie's prime interest is historical . If you're interested in seeing naked bodies - - female or male , or both - - you can see far more attractive nudity on offer in other films . I'll rate this one just .
418954	1609079	15184	3.0	The mortgage on the old homestead	I'm not a huge fan of cowboy movies . . . and if more cowboy movies were like this one , I wouldn't like them at all . Buck Jones ( billed here as Charles Jones ) gives a good performance , but he plays a hugely implausible character . Jack Mills ( Jones ) and his buddy Loupel ( also cried Jack , but nicknamed " Bud " ) are both in love with Jean Ross ( played by the dull Betty Bouton ) . Confronted with a pair of Jacks , Jean chooses Bud . Jack loves Jean so much that her happiness is more important to him than his own , so he chivalrously stands aside . Bud and Jean get a humble homestead and settle into housekeeping , but they soon have trouble paying the mortgage , which is held by a banker named Rand . The title cards cry him " Banker Rand " as if ' Banker ' was his name . For the sake of the young married couple - - really for Jean's sake - - Jack stages a hold-up to kill the banker . Jack is duly charged for the crime . But now , get this : Jack's buddy Bud can be just as self-effacing as Jack , and Bud gallantly takes the blame for Jack's crime . SPOILERS NOW . Bud dies , leaving his wife a widow with their young son Jack Junior . So , with Bud taking the rap for Jack's crime ( which he committed for Jean's sake ) , Jack marries Jean and adopts her son as his own . Goldang it ! I guess there's some sort of Code of the West that makes this stuff plausible to somebody out there . I give a lot of credit to Buck Jones because he was a hero in real life : he died rescuing other people from a nightclub fire . But this movie is just cowpoke nonsense , and I'll rate it only .
418504	1609079	99250	3.0	Small-time true-crime , facts fudged .	CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . ' Chicago Joe and the Showgirl ' is based on the true story of Karl Hulten and Elizabeth Jones . Hulten was a Swedish-born American GI stationed in England during WW2 . Jones was a Welsh-born woman who had drifted through several professions , including striptease . When Hulten and Jones met ( in October 1944 ) , they embarked on a crime spree that lasted for only a few violent days . This is the same premise that's been told better elsewhere . Hulten and Jones had the same dynamic as Bonnie and Clyde , or Starkweather and Fugate ( the couple who inspired the movie ' Badlands ' ) . A cheap psychopath meets a girl who wanted some thrills . She's aroused by the danger he represents . Her arousal emboldens him to increasingly violent acts . ' Chicago Joe and the Showgirl ' opens with an unseen American narrator informing us portentously that this story is absolutely true , and that nothing has been invented nor changed . This sort of statement activates my baloney barometer , but I felt better when I saw David Yallop credited as scriptwriter . Yallop is a brilliant journalist who has authored several true-crime books , impeccably researched and scrupulously accurate . As the opening credits rolled , I recognised the voice of the narrator : he is John Lahr , an American journalist based in London , likewise noted for scrupulous accuracy in his writing . Lahr does not appear on screen in this film , perhaps because his somewhat comical facial features would remind audiences of his father Bert Lahr . ( Coincidentally , the two stars of this film - - Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Lloyd - - also had actor fathers . ) I'm sure that Yallop knows far more than I do about the Hulten / Jones case , yet I spotted two inaccuracies . When Hulten and Jones first meet , he invites her to pick out a well-dressed woman whose fur coat Jones fancies , which Hulten then steals for her . Later , as they seek greater thrills , their crime spree escalates until Hulten murders a cabdriver . In real life , the coat Hulten stole off a woman's back was white ermine ; in this movie , it's a darker fur . More crucially , the film reverses the order of these incidents : in real life , Hulten stole the fur after he murdered the cabbie , with Jones eagerly witnessing both crimes . I assume that the filmmakers deliberately reversed these incidents so that the couple's crimes would build up to the homicide that got them nicked . Emily Lloyd ( Welsh by name but not by upbringing ) makes a creditable effort to copy the working-class Neath accent of Elizabeth Jones . ( Ironically , the real Betty Jones was not very good-looking , even by 1940s standards ; the real Karl Hulten was far more handsome than Kiefer Sutherland . ) Sutherland gives an impressive performance ; in early scenes , he strides through London in a lieutenant's uniform and returns the salutes of enlisted men . Later , we learn that he's actually an AWOL private . This film's art direction is elaborate , yet wretched . Kiefer Sutherland's performance as a 1944 psychopath is compromised by his 1990 hairstyle . ( U . S . Army soldiers in WW2 were not issued styling mousse . ) Emily Lloyd and all the other women in this film have coiffures and make-up reflecting somebody's 1990 notion of 1940s retro , rather than actual 1940s styles . Women in wartime Britain had to improvise cosmetics or do without ; it would have been nice to see some mention of that here . Yet I was impressed by a brief scene of an elaborate multi-tiered wedding cake . . . made of cardboard , with a secret compartment containing the real and far less impressive ( wartime ) cake . At one point , the killers duck into a cinema to watch ' Double Indemnity ' . ( Was this movie screened in wartime England ? ) I dislike movies in which the characters attend a ( better ) movie that conveniently reflects their own situation . After the couple are arrested , the British authorities hand over Hulten to the U . S . Army for military trial . The film gets this detail right : Army lawyers deposed Hulten , then chose to give him back so the Home Office could try him in Crown Court . The movie's climax is utterly laughable , featuring the collision of two old-movie clichés . A line of helmeted and bewhiskered British bobbies ( out of ' Dixon of Dock Green ' ) face off against a line of trenchcoated American reporters with snap-brim trilbies and elaborate flashbulb cameras ( out of ' The Front Page ' ) . I expected the bobbies to twirl their truncheons and mumble ' Here now , what's all this ? ' while the reporters picked up candlestick telephones and shouted ' Get me Rewrite ! ' Actually , this last scene isn't meant to be realistic : it's shown from Betty Jones's viewpoint , and she's now entertaining delusions of showbiz glamour . Still , this climax reminded me of several much better films - - the musical ' Chicago ' , ' King of Comedy ' and especially ' Sunset Boulevard ' - - in which a delusional criminal basks in imaginary stardom while Justice closes in . At the end , Lahr's narration returns to tell us the outcome : Hulten was executed in HM Prison Pentonville a few weeks before V-E Day . Betty Jones was given a long prison sentence , and eventually paroled . The grim truth is that this ' wild ' couple , often deemed the British version of Bonnie and Clyde , were two very common criminals indeed . So were the real Bonnie and Clyde - - in their entire crime career , Bonnie and Clyde never stole as much money as Jesse James grabbed in a single hold-up - - but at least Bonnie and Clyde were brilliant at self-promotion , and they'll be famous for a long time . Hulten and Jones were cheap and worthless , and they deserve to be forgotten . So does this movie , which I'll rate .
418256	1609079	28543	3.0	Shirley Temple's evil twin	Jane Withers's film career had the bad luck to occur at the same time as Shirley Temple's , and under contract at the same studio ( Fox ) . Both of these child actresses were very similar in their talents and appeal . But Shirley was much prettier than Jane , and just that bit more talented as an actress , singer , dancer and impressionist . When they appeared together in ' Bright Eyes ' , it made perfect sense to cast Shirley as the good-girl orphan and Jane Withers as the spoilt brat . In adulthood , Jane Withers had some minor fame as a character actress ( most notably in ' Giant ' ) and she had steady employment for many years in a long-running series of commercials as the dungrareed Josephine , a ' lady plumber ' who encourages her clients to use Comet cleansing powder . ( Were any little girls ever inspired by Josephine to become plumbers ? ) Another problem with Jane Withers's child-actress career is that she had second choice of Fox's songwriters , scriptwriters and directors , with Shirley always getting first pick . ' 45 Fathers ' is typical of Jane's star vehicles . . . meaning it's very sub-Shirley . In this one , Jane plays a bubbly orphan whose father was a member of the Rod & Gun Club . The by-laws of the club state that , if any member's death leaves minor children surviving , the membership as a whole are to adopt the orphans if no family member comes forward . So , the Rod & Gun Club collectively adopt little Jane . Unfortunately , all the clubmen are a bunch of old codgers . Of all these geezers , it falls to Bunny Carothers to be the one actually to take Jane into his home . With a name like Bunny Carothers , I thought he'd be hanging about with Raffles the cracksman . . . but that's another film . Bunny's nice young nephew Roger lives with him . Roger has a girlfriend Elizabeth who's just a gold-digger . When he wises up and gives her the brush-off , she sues him for breach of promise . . . expecting to get some of old man Carothers's Bunny-money . It's no surprise that little Jane puts everything right . There's nothing here that you won't get more enjoyably in a Shirley Temple movie . Shirley's speaking voice and singing voice are pleasanter to hear than Jane's , and Shirley's smiling face is easier on the eyes than Jane's . I was hoping the members of the Rod & Gun Club would change the title of this movie to ' COLT . 45 fathers ' : in the last reel , they would take the shotguns out of their gun racks and start gunning for little orphan Jane . ( And they could save a few cartridges for bit player Chester Clute . ) Oh , well . I'll rate this movie .
419096	1609079	15027	3.0	Turgid mellerdrammer from a mail-order school .	Turner Entertainment have a print of ' Judgment of the Storm ' , but this movie's gestation is far more interesting than the movie itself . By the 1920s , movies were big business , and many Americans believed there was big money in writing screenplays ! Several mail-order companies made considerable money catering for this delusion , selling screenplay-writing correspondence courses . One such company , the Palmer Photoplay School , whose bursar was apparently embarrassed that none of his alumni had achieved wealth as screenwriters , proceeded to bankroll a film based on a script treatment by one of their own students : one Ethel Styles Middleton . Amazingly , this movie also spawned a novelisation published by Grosset & Dunlap , written by one Roy Mason . ( A real author , or a house pseudonym ? ) What a turgid melodrama ! The story is set in Darienne , a college town which ( as a shot of a railway timetable informs us ) is 49 minutes by rail from New York City . Of course , all we ever see of academic activity is a brief glimpse of the football gridiron . Hard-working ploughboy Dave Heath ( Bruce Gordon ) is the sole support of his widdered mother and four siblings , but his spoilt brother Bob doesn't care that Dave works like a slave . The two youngest Heaths are insufferable twins Paul and Patsy , who speak their dialogue in twee intertitles . Paul is played by young Frankie Darro , the real-life son of circus performers . In this movie's first reel , we see Darro perform a spinning headstand : he later performed this same stunt in the last reel of ' Wild Boys of the Road ' , but here he does it while balanced on a ledge . The family's dimpled ingenue is sweet Mary , who's in love with campus hero John Trevor ( Lloyd Hughes ) , whose wealthy widowed mother has been away in Europe these past three years . Erm , not quite : actually , Helene Trevor is half-owner of a " Temple of Chance " . . . an illegal gambling den . The dialogue is careful to establish that Helene doesn't WANT to be a crook : she inherited the business from her late husband , but she " loathes " it and wants to get out . Still , she uses the money to put John through college . The viper in this brew is rich boy Martin Freeland , who could attend Harvard or Yale but who allegedly attends Darienne solely to be near Mary Heath ! Sorry , but actress Lucille Ricksen quite fails to radiate any appeal strong enough to make this plausible , and Mary clearly doesn't fancy Martin . She has eyes only for John , who doesn't suspect how his mama makes her moolah . When Martin learns the truth , he arranges for John to meet Mrs Trevor in her den of iniquity , in a sequence that reminded me of the similar meeting in " East of Eden " . SPOILERS NOW . Anna Q . Nilsson , in a small role as a casino vamp , triggers a fight causing John accidentally to kill Dave . Awash in remorse , John abandons his own life's plans to take Dave's place and support the Heaths . There's lots of fist-to-forehead histrionics here , and overwrought title cards : " Will sorrow give Dave back to us ? Will it harvest the grain - - will it feed the children ? " In his death scene , actor Bruce Gordon can't simply die : he has to do an entire " I'm shot ! " swooning routine . Later , Helene Trevor saves the lives of Bob and the twee twins , believing that she has doomed herself in the bargain . Her intertitles fairly drip with lavender and old lace : " Tell their mother - - I send her three - - for the one I took . " Not half ! It's a shame that Lloyd Hughes is now remembered solely for ' The Lost World ' and ' The Mysterious Island ' , in which he was upstaged by , respectively , a brontosaurus and a race of underwater midgets . Hughes was occasionally a good actor ( as in ' Hail the Woman ' ) , but in ' Judgment of the Storm ' he gets caught up in the orgy of overacting . My rating for this turgid bathos is only , mostly for the art direction .
418698	1609079	30280	3.0	Some funny stuff , but not enough to justify the rest .	Many of Tex Avery's cartoons at Warner Bros were parodies of the short subjects that ( in those days ) were screened during a trip to the movies before the main feature . ' The Isle of Pingo Pongo ' is a parody of travelogue movies : specifically , the ' Going Places ' shorts that Lowell Thomas narrated for Universal . Since modern viewers of this toon are unlikely to be familiar with the original material being parodied , a large amount of the humour is lost . There are also references in this 1938 cartoon to other cultural fixtures of that time , such as the then-popular ' Life Goes to a Party ' feature in Henry Luce's weekly magazine , and the wildlife documentaries of Martin and Osa Johnson . Perceptive modern viewers will sense that something is being guyed here , but will be frustrated because they probably don't know the source material . Some of the material here is worse than it needed to be . There's a rather strained gag , depicting a ship taking a circuitous route across a map of the world from the United States to Africa . But the gag is not made funnier by the map's gross inaccuracy . Would it have hurt Leon Schlesinger's production schedule to include an accurate map of the world in that shot ? This cartoon has provoked some controversy for racist content . Sure enough , we get the usual dumb jokes about African natives with pneumatic lips and bones in their topknots . I found the jokes mostly so weak that they aren't malicious , but also so weak that they aren't funny . What did offend me here was the narrator's continuous referrals to these African caricatures as ' savages ' and ' aborigines ' . Even some brilliant Warners toons are seriously weakened by bad running gags ending in limp finishes : a classic example of this problem is ' The Dover Boys ' , featuring innovative animation , a clever and unusual premise , but an incredibly bad running gag leading into a weak fade-out . Here in ' The Isle of Pingo Pongo ' we seem to have one more example of that same problem , with Egghead ( Tex Avery's proto-Elmer Fudd character ) periodically showing up with a violin case and asking the unseen narrator ' Now , boss ? ' . ' Not yet ! ' the narrator tells him each time . I had very low expectations for a funny pay-off gag , but I was pleasantly surprised . Lowell Thomas's travelogues always ended in a deep cliché of his own creation : " And so , as the sun sinks slowly in the west , we bid a fond farewell to . . . " . My former mother-in-law recalled for me that , as a moviegoer in the 1930s , she would hear members of the audience reciting these overly-familiar words along with Thomas's narration . In the last few seconds of its screen time , ' The Isle of Pingo Pongo ' goes a considerable distance towards redeeming itself with a juicy parody of Thomas's sign-off , giving Egghead a closing gag that turns out to be surprisingly very funny indeed . Unfortunately , modern viewers who aren't familiar with the clichés being parodied here won't get the full effect of the good jokes , but WILL get the full effect of the racial stereotyping . Under the circumstances , my rating for this bad ' un is just .
418381	1609079	332003	3.0	A mouse and a camel	This was a quickie TV special , made to profit from the popularity of Olympic figure skater Dorothy Hamill . I'll declare quite openly that figure skating doesn't remotely interest me unless I find the female skater very sexy , such as Belita or Sonja Henie or the early Tonya Harding . I respect Dorothy Hamill's achievements , and she seems earnest and sincere , but her bland personality puts me right off . If Gene Kelly hadn't been in this special , I wouldn't have watched it at all . There's a low-key opening number , with Hamill skating languidly while the offscreen Kelly sings a lullaby about ' a girl from Riverside , Connecticut ' ( that would be Hamill ) , so you know the next line of the lyric will end in ' etiquette ' . Gene Kelly had previously proved his ability on roller skates ; here , when he takes to the ice , he shows an easy grace . . . but he's clearly not in Hamill's league . A 6-year-old figure skater named Carrie Weber also demonstrates her abilities . She shows some presence , and her skating is impressive . . . but , like Kelly , she pales in comparison with Hamill . There's a weird exhibition here , in which Weber stands at rinkside and calls out skating manoeuvres while Hamill performs them . In addition to her distinctive short hairstyle ( shown to advantage here ) , Hamill was apparently best known for inventing a skating manoeuvre called the Hamill Camel . At Carrie Weber's command , Hamill demonstrates her Camel . I'm damned if I see the point of this thing . It doesn't remotely resemble a camel : I assume that this name was chosen only for the rhyme . Several of Hamill's other moves and combinations are far more impressive , so what's the point of this so-called Camel ? Later , Kelly joins Hamill in ice-skating versions of a couple of his famous numbers from his MGM glory days . I was hoping we'd see " Singin ' in the Rain " with ice cubes instead of raindrops . Instead , Hamill and Weber perform ' The Worry Song ' . This was the song which Kelly had originally sung in ' Anchors Aweigh ' , memorably dancing with an animated cartoon of Jerry the Mouse ( from Tom and Jerry ) . Here , we have little Carrie Weber togged out in a mouse costume ( looking too cute for words ) skating alongside Hamill while the latter sings Kelly's former lyric . It would have been very impressive indeed if Weber could have duplicated Jerry's cartoon dance steps from the movie , but the bulky mouse costume suppresses her movements considerably . I'll rate this sporadically interesting special , but people who like ice skating will likely rate it higher . I prefer Belita .
418952	1609079	226746	3.0	Oh , Henry !	I'm a fan of Bert Lahr , and I'm also an advocate for the talents of director Ray McCarey ( the unjustly obscure brother of Leo McCarey ) . So , when I learnt that Bert Lahr played Henry the Eighth in a film directed by Ray McCarey , I was salivating to see it . Lackaday , the movie just ain't very funny . For some reason , the movie breezes past Henry's first three wives , then divides its screen time between Anne of Cleves ( Janet Reade ) and Catherine Howard ( Leni Stengel ) , the latter caught up in her adulterous affair with Thomas Culpeper . That gentleman is played here by Monte Collins , a scrawny actor who looks even less appetising than Bert Lahr , so it's difficult to see why Lahr would be cuckolded here . As Henry Tudor , Lahr makes an attempt to personate the famous Holbein portrait of the king , wearing a beard that looks distressingly scruffy rather than funny . Basically , Lahr does his usual schtick here , but it's less effective than usual against a 16th-century background . We get some dialogue such as " Thou hadst better scram . " Lahr name-drops William Shakespeare , but he's a couple of decades too early . I laughed at a line about " Sir Walter Winchell " , but much of the ( very weak ) comedy here is merely anachronism , with Lahr seeking a 16th-century divorce in Reno and listening to an Atwater-Kent cathedral radio . I was delighted to see Shemp Howard listed in this film's opening credits . Unfortunately , that most under-rated of Stooges appears only very briefly in a role that could have been played by anyone . More pleasantly , we see some chorus girls cavorting in principal-boy doublets and hose . . . historically inaccurate , but I'm not complaining . There's no mention at all of Henry VIII's sixth wife , so I guess this film is below Parr . I'll rate this dismal disappointment only . Or , as Bert Lahr would have put it : " Ong , ong , ong ! "
419255	1609079	40111	3.0	I'm with it , but this movie's without it	In the days when travelling carnivals and circuses were common in America , these shows would often pick up temporary employees along their tour routes . The temporaries might be performers , or might be day labourers ( roustabouts ) , or might be entrepreneurs ( not always honest ones ) selling candy or cheap toys , or running some sort of game ( usually a con , such as three-card monte ) and hoping to make some money for their own pitches from the rake-off of customers who came to see the circus or carnival . Because people who travelled with the circus or carnival were constantly encountering new people , and couldn't always be certain if the newcomers were carny folk or ' civilians ' , they developed the habit of asking ' Are you with it ? ' . . . meaning , ' are you part of this travelling show ? ' . Veteran circus people and carny folk knew what this question meant , but civilians were more likely to reply : ' Am I with WHAT ? ' . This is why someone who is knowledgeable or avant-garde is described as being ' with it ' . ' Are You with It ? ' is a pleasant low-budget musical with a carnival background and no impressive songs . Donald O'Connor plays a rather stiff young nerd named Milton who has a high I . Q . and is very good at maths ( he uses a slide rule while he talks ) , but who is out of touch with his emotions . He loses his job and falls in with some troupers from a passing carnival , including flashy Vivian ( Olga San Juan , cheap and vulgar ) and fast-talking carny pitchman Goldie ( Lew Parker , giving a deft performance of such skill that I'm amazed he didn't go on to a greater career as a character comedian ) . The script forces O'Connor to play a character that's a very poor choice for the protagonist in a musical comedy . About twenty minutes into the movie , some music starts playing and Milton taps one foot idly . Then he breaks into a spirited tap dance , casually explaining that tap dancing is merely a physical application of elementary scientific principles . I didn't like this , me . Donald O'Connor is a brilliant dancer , one of the best who ever performed in films . . . so it's utterly implausible that a wonk like Milton ( who shows no interest in having a good time ) could attain such a level of dancing skill simply by applying his intellect . ' Are You with It ? ' is enjoyable but hardly memorable . O'Connor's dancing is excellent ( as always ) , and he's in better singing voice here than he was in several of his other ( better ) musicals . But the songs which he's singing and dancing aren't especially good . George Balzer , who worked on the script , wrote some of Jack Benny's funniest radio and tv material . . . but you'd never know it from what's on offer here . Veteran comedian Walter Catlett has almost nothing to do in this movie , and he's easily upstaged by Lew Parker . I'll rate ' Are You with It ? ' : that's one point for Lew Parker's performance , and one point for each of Donald O'Connor's tap-dancing feet .
418705	1609079	183777	3.0	I don't mean to be mean to Armenia , but . . .	I saw the Armenian comedy ' Shor and Shorshor ' in October 2007 at the Cinema Muto festival in Pordenone , Italy ; the festival screened a new 35mm print struck from a 28mm diacetate . I didn't think much of this film : it's an extremely crude comedy ; so very crude that I was surprised to learn that its year of production was 1927 rather than circa 1912 . Readers of this site may feel that I'm unfairly comparing an Armenian movie to contemporary product from Hollywood ( or Britain ) made on a much bigger budget , with higher production values . In fact , although I recognise that Armenian film-makers in the 1920s did not have loadsadosh , there were quite a few other nations in Central Europe ( and Asia ) making far more sophisticated movies by 1927 , often with no more money to spend than was splashed out here . IMDb's synopsis is accurate . The two friends get drunk and have various hallucinations , including an appearance by the Devil . ( Priests don't come off very well here either . ) Inanimate objects misbehave , but who cares ? Georges Melies was doing this sort of thing much better back in 1903 . In fact , the Devil had a more interesting costume in Melies's movies too . I'll rate this one just barely ; I would have rated it even lower , but I expect that this movie deserves extra credit for being made in such an impoverished place . And the exteriors offer us a few pleasant views of the Armenian countryside .
419498	1609079	18607	3.0	Bolshevik borscht	The Hollywood producer Sam Goldwyn had a Greta Garbo complex : for well over a decade , he made repeated attempts to find some exotic European actress whom he could lure to Hollywood and mould into the next Garbo . He brought several would-be Garbos to Hollywood , but none of them ever clicked . The least unsuccessful of these was Anna Sten , who was pretty and somewhat talented but definitely no Garbo . Several years after Sten's career failed to take off , Goldwyn was still importing new Garbo wanna-be's . . . with the result that one of them became known as " Goldwyn's Last Sten " . ' Zemlya v plenu ' is intended as a starring vehicle for Anna Stein ; she is pretty and personable here , but hardly a great actress . Yakov is a poor sharecropper who comes back from the war and marries his childhood love , the illiterate peasant girl Maria ( Sten ) . When Yakov tries to lease an acre of land from the local nobleman ( a Baron who is literally a land baron ) , the Baron rents to Yakov and Maria the acre which is at the very bottom of his valley . . . so it is full of all the boulders and stones which have rolled down both sides of the hill . When Yakov falls behind on the rent , the Baron forces Maria to come to his estate and work as a nurse-companion for his adult daughter Anya . Still working the farm , Yakov sends letters to his illiterate wife , telling her how terrible things are . Maria asks Anya to read the letters for her . Anya wants to keep Maria with her on the manor , so she maliciously deludes Maria . . . pretending to read the letters aloud but actually inventing new text in which Yakov reports that everything is tickety-boo down on the farm . Eventually Anya's husband tries to rape Maria . When she defends herself , the Baron and his household close ranks round his son-in-law ( can't have any scandal , you know ) , and Maria is falsely denounced as a prostitute . When the news reaches Yakov , will he still love her ? When I saw this movie , I understood Ira Gershwin's line about " more skies of grey than any Russian play " . This is a Russian soap opera , full of gloom and doom and mutterings . Sten's performance is good , but nowhere near Garbo's standards . The actor who plays Yakov is good , although he overdoes his peasant get-up . Mikhail Markov is excellent as the lip-curling Baron . The actor playing the son-in-law is competent , whilst the actress portraying Anya overacts horribly . Much of the content is intended as communist propaganda : we're clearly meant to see how terrible things used to be in Russia during the bad old days of the White Russian aristocracy . There are some beautiful exterior shots in this movie , and the lighting and art direction are excellent . I wish that the various talents involved in this film had been able to collaborate on better material . I'll rate this movie . Pass the borscht , comrade .
418642	1609079	273497	3.0	Hocus pocus , fix the focus	' Ching Ling Foo ' was the stage name of Chi Ling Qua , a native of Peking who studied the stagecraft of illusionists in his native China , then performed those tricks with tremendous success for audiences in Europe and America in the late Victorian and early Edwardian era . Ching always made it clear that his magic tricks were conjuring illusions , but they were so far ahead of anything performed by western magicians at this time that his magic tricks seemed very nearly supernatural . Among his other tricks , Ching exhaled smoke and fire , and produced a 15-foot long ( telescoping ) pole from his mouth ! His most popular trick went as follows : he would display both sides of a silk cloth , drape it across the stage , then whisk it away to reveal a large basin filled with water . After splashing some of the water into the footlights , he would cover the basin with the cloth , then whisk it away once more : the water had vanished , and now a boy stood up inside the basin . Ching never revealed how this trick was done , although some modern magicians could likely duplicate it . In his own era , Ching had many imitators but no equals . ' Ching Ling Foo Outdone ' is a crude silent movie which evokes the great Chinese illusionist in its title , but he does not appear in this film . Instead , a simply-dressed ( Occidental ) magician displays an empty cloth , spreads it on the floor , then removes it to reveal a washtub filled with water . He places the cloth on this , then whisks it away to reveal several geese swimming in the tub . He shoos away the geese , then makes the tub disappear : a grinning boy takes its place . In theory , this is a duplication of Ching's most famous illusion , made slightly more difficult by the addition of the geese . But Ching's trickery ( in front of live audiences ) was seamless , whereas - from our modern viewpoint - the trickery in this film is very obvious indeed . It relies upon jump cuts ( the same gimmick used 60 years later in the TV series ' Bewitched ' ) . The magician freezes his position for a few minutes ( and the camera stops grinding ) while stagehands shift the props onstage . . . then the action starts again . Georges Melies was doing much cleverer tricks with this same gimmick in France at this same time . I'll rate ' Ching Ling Foo Outdone ' . Its historical value as an example of early cinema is negligible . As a film record of a Victorian conjuring act , this film has no value at all . . . because it relies upon trick photography instead of genuine stagecraft .
419489	1609079	43915	4.0	Archie Leach's weirdest film	Some movies take place in their own weird universe , but they usually proclaim that weirdness in the opening frame . ' People Will Talk ' starts out looking like a conventional Cary Grant comedy ( from his middle period ) but it becomes gradually weirder in subtle ways . I wasn't surprised to learn that this movie is a remake of a German stage play ; some of the events in this movie would be vaguely plausible if they took place in Germany between the wars . But when set in an American college town in 1951 , these situations are very unbelievable indeed . Cary Grant plays a brilliant surgeon named Dr Noah Praetorius . Of course this puts me in mind of ' Dr Pretorius ' , the mad scientist played so brilliantly by Ernest Thesiger in ' Bride of Frankenstein ' . But even if ' Bride ' had never been made , there's something very mad-scientist about the name ' Noah Praetorius ' . It's a very conspicuous name . Late in this movie , Cary Grant's character casually mentions that his forename was originally Ludwig , but he changed it to Noah . ( As if the name ' Noah ' is any less conspicuous than ' Ludwig ' . ) This is just one minor example of the many weirdnesses on offer here . SPOILERS COMING . Dr Praetorius marries Deborah , one of his medical students . Isn't that a breach of ethics ? Deborah is played by dull untalented Jeanne Crain . She and Praetorius ' meet cute ' when Deborah faints , believing herself to be pregnant . Praetorius assures her she's not pregnant . Three months later they're married : when Deborah realises she's pregnant now , she assumes she's carrying Praetorius's child . Erm , no : turns out she really was pregnant the first time , and Praetorius deliberately lied and told her she wasn't pregnant so she'd feel better . Smooth move , doc . After Praetorius reveals this deception , he's surprised when Deborah gets angry . I dislike films in which an extremely accomplished protagonist , whose career puts major claims on his time and energy , also has a hobby which requires large commitments of time and discipline . Dr Praetorius is a surgeon , but as a hobby he conducts an amateur symphony orchestra ! Walter Slezak - with his Austrian accent , unkempt hair and baggy sweater - is cast as a physicist who plays bass viol in Grant's amateur orchestra . Despite the English surname of Slezak's character , his role seems to be based on Albert Einstein : an unkempt physicist who played amateur violin . The orchestra scenes in this movie are wretched , and Grant deserves most of the blame . This is Grant's second consecutive movie in which he plays a surgeon . To prepare for his role as a brain surgeon in ' Crisis ' , Grant went to considerable trouble to learn how to handle surgical instruments convincingly . In ' People Will Talk ' , Grant handles a conductor's baton in a manner that shows he has absolutely no knowledge of conducting . He keeps changing tempi , and his down beat doesn't synch with the actions of the onscreen musicians . In several scenes set outside the rehearsal hall - notably when Grant goes to visit Jeanne Crain's uncle's farmhouse - the orchestral music on the soundtrack is so obtrusive that I actually thought Dr Praetorius's orchestra were following him ! This wouldn't be much odder than anything else that happens in this film . MORE SPOILERS . Finlay Currie ( whom I worked with in the mid-1960s ) plays Grant's mysterious companion Shunderson , and there seems to be something fey about him ( in the Scottish sense of that term ) . This is especially strong in a scene in which Currie is able to calm a dog simply by staring at him . The whole movie is so weird , I thought that Currie's character might turn out to be a supernatural entity ( like Ian Hunter in ' Strange Cargo ' ) . Get this : Shunderson is a dead man walking . Years ago , he was sentenced to death and executed , and his body was delivered to Dr Praetorius for dissection . But Shunderson really wasn't dead after all ( except in the legal sense ) , so Dr Praetorius revived him and Shunderson has been living with Praetorius ever since : a man with no legal identity and no means of support . This situation might be vaguely plausible in Germany circa 1925 , but it's completely unbelievable in 1951 America . Also , it emphasises the ' mad scientist ' aspects of Cary Grant's role . Dr Praetorius has a secret too : years ago he ran a butcher's shop , but his customers were outraged to discover that their local butcher was actually a qualified surgeon . Again , this would be somewhat more plausible if it were set in Germany in 1925 . During the Weimar period , when food shortages were rampant in Germany , there was a scandal when it turned out that several butcher shops replenished their stock with human flesh . Much of the dialogue in this movie sounds as if it were translated ( badly ) from a German original . So many weird little touches in this movie go nowhere . The dialogue tells us that Deborah was born in London , yet there's nothing remotely English about Jeanne Crain's portrayal . Her father and her uncle are played respectively by Sidney Blackmer ( very good , as usual ) and Will Wright . . . but these two actors - playing brothers who grew up together and live together well past middle age - are radically disparate in their physical appearances , body language and speech patterns . Hume Cronyn , under heavy makeup , is excellent in a badly-written and unsympathetic role , as a college dean who tries to censor Praetorius . All the villains in this movie are a bunch of Aunt Sallys , crudely set up to be easily knocked down by Praetorius's witty comments . . . which aren't so witty after all . Joseph L Mankiewicz , who wrote and directed this movie , has done brilliant work elsewhere . . . but he badly stumbles in this movie . I'll rate ' People Will Talk ' . An interesting attempt at something different , but only slightly successful .
419360	1609079	21658	4.0	Don't try this at home , kids !	Whenever I hear a reference to ' the Little Rascals ' , I cringe . This is partly because I just don't find those kids very funny , but largely because there never really was a ' Little Rascals ' movie . Hal Roach's long-running series of low-budget kiddie comedies were actually called the ' Our Gang ' shorts ( ' Our Gang ' being the title of the first film in the series ) . For some reason , the movie prints that have been syndicated for television were retitled ' Little Rascals ' . If you own any movies with ' Little Rascals ' in the credits , you've got a TV print . ' Big Ears ' is one of the few sound-era Our Gang shorts that has never , to my knowledge , been shown on television . A previous IMDb reviewer says that this is because the storyline involves divorce , a traumatic subject for young children . Well , divorce is mentioned in the dialogue , but that's not why ' Big Ears ' is too touchy for television . The central character in ' Big Ears ' is little Wheezer , one of the more annoying kids in Our Gang ( which is saying a lot ! ) . The title ' Big Ears ' doesn't actually refer to over-sized lugs . It's the nickname for somebody who pokes his ears into conversations where he shouldn't be listening . Wheezer overhears his parents having an argument , in which they consider getting divorced . With the typical logic of childhood , Wheezer decides to feign illness in the hope that his parents will be concerned about his health and forget about divorcing . Wheezer's buddy Stymie believes that Wheezer is actually sick , so he raids the medicine chest for something to dose him with . This sequence is the reason why ' Big Ears ' is never shown on TV . The kids watching at home might get the idea that it's fun to grab random items out of the medicine chest and swallow them . I laughed as Stymie treated Wheezer's nonexistent illness with hair oil and other noxious substances . . . but this is definitely not something that impressionable kiddiewinks should be watching . At one point , Wheezer's father ( played a bit too prissily by Creighton Hale ) refers to African-American child Stymie as ' the little pickaninny ' . A very few of the Our Gang films have racist plot lines - - notably the notorious ' Kid from Borneo ' - - but many of the Our Gangs had casual examples of racial stereotyping that are tossed out at random . This is one such example , but it only lasts a few seconds in ' Big Ears ' and could easily have been cut out . The real problem is the medicine-chest sequence , which is the only part of this movie that I laughed at . I do like the fact that the Our Gang comedies showed white and black kids playing together as equals , in a time when racial segregation was taken for granted . . . but there's still plenty of racial slurs in these movies . I'll rate ' Big Ears ' .
419022	1609079	43618	4.0	Bobby Howes should have sued .	The oddly-named Vera-Ellen was to movie dancing what Sonja Henie was to movie ice-skating : blonde , girlish , always delightful to watch , but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material . When I watch Vera-Ellen's sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in ' Words and Music ' , I can't help noticing that her blouse ( yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes ) seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag . For some reason , the very American Vera-Ellen starred in two musicals ( made several years apart ) set in Edinburgh , a city not noted for its tap-dancers : ' Let's Be Happy ' and ' Happy Go Lovely ' . In the latter , Cesar Romero plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh . There's a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival , which is nonsense : the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows . We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile : apart from a few Highland accents , there's absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie . The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning , when we learn that the title of Romero's show is ' Frolics to You ' : this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks won't . Vera-Ellen is , as usual , cute and appealing and an impressive dancer , but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad . The plot - - mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson - - is brainless , though no more so than the plots of several dozen Hollywood musicals . Romero is less annoying than usual here , probably because ( for once ) he isn't required to convince us that he's interested in bedding the heroine . The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of Bobby Howes . The father of Sally Ann Howes was a major star of West End stage musicals ; his wistful rendition of " She's My Lovely " was a big hit in Britain in 1937 . Here , he shows up in several scenes as Romero's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number , nor even any real comedy . It's absolutely criminal that this movie - - with a title containing the word ' Lovely ' , sure to evoke Howes's greatest hit - - would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do ! The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts ( whom I worked with once ) shines in one restaurant sequence , and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall . As Vera-Ellen's confidante , somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard : it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go , but doesn't match either . Val Guest has a story credit , but this movie doesn't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies . The colour photography is wretched , though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywood's process work . ' Happy Go Lovely ' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster , with ' waster ' being the operative word . I'll rate this movie just .
419589	1609079	18137	4.0	Surgery perjury	George Melford's reputation has risen sharply in recent years . For decades , his best-known film was ' The Sheik ' , starring Valentino . In the 1990s , a Cuban archive released a rare print of the Spanish-language version of ' Dracula ' which Melford directed concurrently with Tod Browning's English-language version , using the same sets and costumes . Melford's production is widely considered superior to the Browning version . And yet , Melford's CV ends with a long list of undistinguished low-budgeters . Is he an underrated director , or was he a mediocre talent who just occasionally had bursts of inspiration ? ' A Man's Past ' shows Melford to be an extremely variable director . There are some impressive frame compositions here , and the overall pacing is good , but two of the leading cast members overact so badly that Melford must be faulted for failing to restrain them . Fortunately the central role in this drama is played by Conrad Veidt , who never gave a bad performance . SPOILERS COMING . Veidt stars as Dr Paul La Roche , a French surgeon who intentionally killed a terminally-ill patient who was in chronic pain . It's clear to us that this was euthanasia , and that La Roche's motives were good , but he was convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years ' hard labour in a prison on an island off the coast of France . Of course , the prison governor is corrupt and the warders are sadists . We see Veidt looking like Edmond Dantes : gaunt , with long stringy hair and beard . The governor's assistant is Lieutenant Destin , played in epicene manner by Arthur Edmund Carewe . When a prisoner snatches a warder's gun and shoots the prison governor , the resident medical officer is unable to remove the bullet . ( This sawbones is played by Charles Puffy , who was Puffy by name and puffy by nature : a coarse-looking man who simply fails to radiate the intellect appropriate for this role . ) Destin offers La Roche a pardon if he saves the governor's life . Of course , La Roche succeeds . Of course , the governor reneges on the deal . Up until now , La Roche has stoically accepted his sentence . . . but now that his personal honour has been blemished , he decides to escape . Vive la France ! Donnez-moi le fromage ! La Roche washes up in Marseilles , where he meets the beauteous Yvonne Fontaine , sister of a prominent surgeon . Dr Fontaine's eyesight is failing , so La Roche steps in and does the surgery for him . Brilliantly , of course . This gives Yvonne an idea : they can maintain La Roche's freedom and her brother's reputation by moving to Algeria , where nobody knows them . La Roche will live openly as Dr Fontaine , performing surgery in his name . Fade in , and now the ' Fontaine ' clinic in Algeria has become world-famous . La Roche is now attracted to Yvonne , but the relationship is stymied because he's pretending to be her brother . Eventually , guess who shows up in Algeria . Zut Alors , it's Lieutenant Destin . Of course he meets Yvonne and is attracted to her . Then he meets her ' brother ' , whom he recognises as escaped convict La Roche . The rivals square off . It would be satisfying to see La Roche kill Destin , but then he would be guilty of a murder less defensible than the one that got him nicked in the first place . So , the scriptwriter hands a firearm to the blind Dr Fontaine , who uses his last remaining remnant of retina to aim his weapon and kill Destin . Veidt's performance is ( as always ) impressive , and Ian Keith as Dr Fontaine offers a goodish turn in a role that gives him an excuse to chew the scenery . Far more annoying are Barbara Bedford and Carewe , both of whom seem to think this movie is Amateur Night . It doesn't help that every plot development in this story seems to trundle into place like clockwork . It's too bad that Veidt's restrained performance isn't in a better movie with a different script . As it stands , I'll rate this film .
419631	1609079	24484	4.0	Hitler comes to Hollywood	A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that ' Rafter Romance ' is a ' rip-off ' ( that's the other reviewer's term ) of a German musical called ' Me By Day , You By Night ' . Apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from ' Box and Cox ' , an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847 . This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady , each man believing himself the sole tenant . Because the two men have different work schedules , the ruse is not discovered straight away . This play was once so popular in Britain that ' to Box and Cox it ' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person . The innovation of ' Rafter Romance ' ( and its predecessor ) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman , who inevitably develop a romance . As is usual in these cornball movies , the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other's arms . Hoo boy . The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney , a character actor who specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic . George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green ( the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit ) but Sidney's depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch . The single most notable thing about ' Rafter Romance ' is that , to my knowledge , this is the earliest Hollywood film to make reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism . At one point in this movie , landlord Eckbaum ( Sidney ) discovers his teenage son Julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls . The Eckbaum characters in this movie are clearly meant to be Jewish . Admittedly , few people in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe . . . still , it's surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke . His father is , quite properly , angered by this display of the Nazi symbol . A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939 . Hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as ' Aryan ' so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria . For the same reason , Hollywood's leading men were documented as ' Aryan and uncircumcised ' . Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox , all the Hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were Jewish . . . but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler . I'm surprised that ' Rafter Romance ' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably , as this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria . ( Maybe the scene was cut out for German release : it isn't crucial to the movie's plot . ) Apart from this , the movie contains nothing notable . Robert Benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation : I've never understood the appeal of this man . I'll rate ' Rafter Romance ' .
419611	1609079	20956	4.0	Boop-a-doop bootleggers	' Heads Up ' stars Helen Kane , who is now remembered only in parody as the prototype for Betty Boop . The animated character in the Fleischer cartoons is blatantly similar to Helen Kane's screen persona : same hairstyle , same annoying speaking voice ( Kane sounds like Gracie Allen on helium ) , same ' boop-oop-a-doop ' syllables scatted into the breaks in her lyrics . Kane sued the Fleischer studio : amazingly , she lost , and Max Fleischer then released a gloating newsreel clip featuring several chorus girls made up to look like Kane . Helen Kane's home studio ( Paramount ) didn't care about the controversy , as they were also distributing Fleischer's Betty Boop cartoons . . . and making more money off the animated imitation than off the live-action original . None of Helen Kane's movies are very good , except for ' Paramount on Parade ' ( in which she has merely a guest shot ) and just possibly ' Sweetie ' ( in which she plays only a supporting role ) , so her films are seldom revived . The Boop cartoons , of course , are constantly revived . . . so , for modern viewers seeing Kane for the first time , it's hard to avoid the perception that Helen Kane is imitating Betty Boop rather than just the other way round . It seems very unfair that the original has been entirely upstaged by the Boop-a-Duplicate . In ' Heads Up ' , Kane actually plays a character named Betty , which gives you an idea of where Fleischer got the name for his cartoon character . ' Heads Up ' was originally a flop Broadway musical with tunes by Rodgers and Hart , who are the only songwriters listed in this film's on-screen credits ( unless you count director Victor Schertzinger , who also wrote tunes ) . The songs in this movie are quite lame , easily Rodgers's and Hart's bottom-drawer stuff . I did enjoy some very spirited hoofing by little Billy Taylor during one of Kane's songs : why didn't Taylor ever make it in musicals ? High-society Newport widow Martha Trumbull owns a yacht , the Silver Lady , for the private use of herself and her two daughters Mary and Betty . Mary ( Margaret Breen ) is meant to be the ' pretty ' sister , and Betty ( Helen Kane ) is meant to be the ' funny ' sister , but neither is much of either . The wealthy Mrs Trumbull employs Captain Denny and Skippy Dugan to staff the yacht , but they're often kept idle at the quay because the family aren't using the yacht . So , to make valuable use of his time , the villainous Denny uses the Silver Lady for bootleg runs . He takes her out beyond the three-mile-limit and comes back with hooch . The galley cook Skippy - - more like a galley slave - - is played by Victor Moore . I've never found Moore funny , but I'm intensely in awe of his career as a performer . Some major Broadway musicals had roles written specifically as vehicles for Moore . I've interviewed old-time Broadway figures who worked with Moore , and they tell me that he was a genuinely modest and self-effacing man . I really want to like him on the screen , but he tends to play the same character every time . . . and I find that character very wearying . Here , Moore invents bizarre contraptions that seem more appropriate for certain other comedians of this same period ( Ed Wynn , Joe Cook , Clark & McCulloch ) rather than for Moore's usual characterisation . Moore keeps mispronouncing his dialogue : he pronounces ' baloney ' so it rhymes with ' mahogany ' . Most of his other mispronunciations are so subtle , it's not clear whether they're genuine errors or bad attempts to be funny . The male lead is Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , except that the credits don't include his nickname ' Buddy ' . He plays a handsome Coast Guard officer who teams up with gumshoe Gene Gowing to catch the bootleggers . There is , of course , a romantic subplot between Rogers and Breen . . . and if you can't guess how it ends , you haven't been paying attention . The camera-work throughout is wretched . During the cotillion sequence , a shot begins with two people standing slightly off-centre in the frame . The camera nudges itself slightly to starboard , to centre the actors . Then a third person enters at the left , and the camera moves leftward to re-centre the shot . Similar adjustments occur throughout the film . During Kane's most elaborate dance number , we briefly see an overhead shot of the sort which most people think was invented by Busby Berkeley . Elsewhere in this same number , a very personable and beautiful chorus girl does splendid knee lifts right behind Kane : I wish that the camera had shoved Kane out of the way to concentrate on this chorus girl . I suspect that the title of this movie is a cheeky joke . The phrase ' Heads Up ' is never spoken nor sung anywhere in the film . . . but the movie has a maritime theme , and guess which part of a ship is the ' head ' . Otherwise , the jokes on offer here are slightly mouldy . When villainous Captain Denny ( Harry Shannon ) asks Victor Moore ' You know what mutiny is , don't you ? ' , Moore replies ' Yes , sir . Mutiny is a show they give in the afternoon . ' Get the hook ! I'll rate this flotsam , mostly out of sympathy for the production difficulties of early movie musicals .
418955	1609079	16378	4.0	He dis-sables his wife .	I wonder if this movie was written by a fur fetishist , or possibly by a fur-phobe . Somebody involved in ' Souls for Sables ' seems to be firmly convinced that every woman has an innately evil side that will come to the surface if she acquires a fur coat , especially a sable . Fred Garlan is a working stiff whose wife Alice pesters him to give her a sable coat , but he can't afford it . Then Alice meets the older roue Harrison Morrill , who lets her win money from him in a poker game ; he persuades her to let him invest the money in the stock market for her : when it profits , he uses the funds to buy her the desired sable . But when Fred finds the coat in his wife's wardrobe , all hell breaks loose . Meanwhile , in a seamier subplot , Alice's friend Esther likewise wants a sable . . . but she acquires hers by rather dirtier means than Alice does . When her husband Jim finds out , he promptly shoots her . There's a weird moralistic tone to this film , strongly implying that fur coats are innately evil and immoral . Yet the movie lingers over shots of living mannequins , as well as Alice and Esther , luxuriating in lush sables . All rather hypocritical and mealy-mouthed . My rating for this pot-boiler : barely .
418564	1609079	157617	4.0	The count and the cowboy ; or , Pudd'n'head Wilhelm .	I saw ' The Farmer from Texas ' in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone , Italy . The festival screened a print from a German collection ( the Bundesarchiv in Berlin ) that had English intertitles . This film's bizarre title did not encourage me , but I was keenly interested in seeing the movie when I learnt it was based on a play by Georg Kaiser . He wrote the brilliant expressionist play ' Gas ' , which is now recognised as a crucial influence on Fritz Lang's ' Metropolis ' , my nomination for the greatest movie ever made . Kaiser also wrote ' The Coral ' , a somewhat more realistic stage play - - about a disaffected industrialist who swaps lives with his employee , then murders the employee so as to fake his own death - - which I found deeply moving . ' The Farmer from Texas ' involves a life-swap similar to the one in ' The Coral ' - - at the beginning of life , rather than at the end of life - - but this movie impressed me far less than ' The Coral ' did . The Count von Stjernenhoe ( Christian Bummerstädt ) is a German nobleman who has married Mabel Bratt , the daughter of a wealthy American farmer . She is bringing her father's wealth to the marriage ; this being a German film for German audiences , it's strongly implied that the blue-blooded count brings his superior Übermensch genes to the marriage . Indeed , the marriage soon produces a strapping infant boy . However , for deeply contrived reasons , this kid gets switched with the young son of Mrs Appelboom , an impoverished widow . Each son gets raised in the wrong household . In young manhood , Erik ( Edmund Burns ) is the American farmer who's actually heir to a German earldom , whilst the more effete Akke is the false heir who doesn't know he's actually the son of a hick . Naturally , this German movie assumes that nature trumps nurture , and Erik is a true exemplar of the master race despite his upbringing . The movie is meant to be a comedy , but I didn't laugh once . I do give the film some credit for attempting to guy both of the cultures depicted here : the Old World as well as the New . I've seen or read several of Georg Kaiser's plays , but I'm not familiar with the one that this movie is allegedly based upon . As such , I felt as if I was watching a rip-off of ' The Prince and the Pauper ' or ' Pudd'nhead Wilson ' , both of which feature a premise similar to the one in this movie . This film was directed by Joe May , a Jewish colleague of the half-Jewish Fritz Lang who fled Europe at about the same time as Lang for similar reasons . Both men ended up in Hollywood , but Lang's Stateside film career is far more notable than May's . Shortly before ' The Farmer from Texas ' went into production , Joe May's 22-year-old daughter shot herself to death , apparently an intentional suicide . That might explain why this movie ( allegedly a comedy ) isn't very funny . My rating is just .
418788	1609079	18920	4.0	Nice to look at , but not funny .	' Futuritzy ' is the interesting title of a Felix the Cat cartoon which isn't very funny , but which contains some interesting visual devices . Most of Otto Messmer's Felix toons relied on a stark palette of black and white : in ' Futuritzy ' there's a subtle range of greys which I found much easier on my eyes . Felix goes to see Professor Whoozit , an ' astrologist ' ( that's the word they use here ) who claims he can predict Felix's future by reading his stars . How does he do it ? Easy ! He hits Felix over the head , thus producing a standard cartoon-effect star . ( Wot , only one ? ) The professor then nabs this star , and somehow reads it . Felix has a run-in with a millionaire who has his own personal aviator . Interestingly , the aviator is drawn as a Negro . ( A black ace ? ) Unfortunately , he's drawn in the usual racially stereotyped fashion . I was intrigued that this 1928 cartoon drew the millionaire's aircraft as a monoplane , possibly inspired by Lindbergh's flight of the previous year . In 1928 , most of the aircraft were still biplanes . There's an interesting montage effect when Felix receives a slap-up dinner : a roast chicken morphs into a bottle of milk , which morphs into a fish . Nicely animated ! Later in the same toon , Felix and another male cat have a fistfight on one of those weird jutting outcrops of stone which occur so frequently in Road Runner cartoons but so seldom in real life . Since Felix is in many ways a surreal character - - with his detachable tail and so forth - - it's intriguing that he tends to resolve disputes with conventional fisticuffs . ' Futuritzy ' is nice to look at , but not very funny and the plot is difficult to follow . Felix did better elsewhere , and I'll rate this one only .
418408	1609079	263673	4.0	Stan and Ollie did it better .	The German word ' lumpen ' - - as in ' lumpen proletariat ' - - has no precise English equivalent . It would translate somewhere between ' people of the labouring class ' and ' people who don't matter ' . This film's title ' Lumpenball ' refers to a social event - - a ball - - held by and for such people . ' Lumpenball ' was released in Germany just a week before Lon Chaney died in California , yet somehow this movie feels like something from back in the Mack Sennett era . I found much of this film to be deeply embarrassing , since it's firmly mired in a subclass of marital comedy which is now very archaic : the concept that husband and wife are automatically adversaries ; that a husband can only ever have a good time by sneaking out on his wife , and that it's a wife's duty to prevent her husband from having fun . This short of mindset belongs firmly in the era of Maggie and Jiggs , Laurel and Hardy , ' The Honeymooners ' , ' The Flintstones ' and Donald McGill's seaside postcards . However , SOME of the above are still quite funny ( I'm not talking about YOU , Fred and Barney ) , so perhaps I'm being too harsh towards ' Lumpenball ' . Yet the fact is that I didn't laugh very often while watching this comedy . . . and , when I did , I felt slightly embarrassed that I WAS laughing . Here's the gripping narrative : Doktor Rodenburg Gerhard is an old married man , so of course his wife Eva is a shrew . Their daughter Pauline is married to Amadeus Krause . . . and I felt that the name ' Amadeus Krause ' was the funniest joke in this movie . Frau Krause is a shrew just like her mother , so the two husbands are allies in their misfortune . The two men meet two gaudy young females named Fiffi and Lola who are allegedly ' dancing girls ' ( says this film's dialogue ) , but that's clearly a euphemism for something else . The husbands flirt with these girls , who invite them to the Lumpenball . But in order to get the Lumpenball rolling , Rodenburg and Amadeus will have to get past the Gerhard wife and the Krause spouse . SPOILERS AHEAD . Gerhard fakes a telegram from his very respectable friend Herr Doktor Wiegand ( an attorney ) , claiming an emergency that requires the husbands ' immediate attention . They rush off , leaving their wives at home . Then a visitor arrives : the real Dr Wiegand , unaware that his name has been used as a pretext . The wives quickly rumble that their husbands are up to no good . At the Lumpenball , the husbands switch clothes with two cross-talk comedians named Schluck and Priem , and likewise don the comedians ' stage make-up . When the wives show up , they spot Schluck and Priem wearing masks ( and the husbands ' clothes ) , and assault them with the German equivalent of rolling pins . The joint gets raided , and afterward the husbands have the gleeful satisfaction of seeing their wives publicly exposed as having attended the Lumpenball , whilst the husbands had their fun without any penalty . I well and truly felt as if there were mothballs coming out of this movie , and the only novelty of the situation ( for me , at least ) was that it was being staged within the German culture rather than that of Britain's Whitehall farces or American vaudeville . When this movie was released in 1930 , Hitler was just getting warmed up . I wonder if these sorts of shenanigans were still being enjoyed by the German working-class just a couple of years later . My rating for this lump of balls ' Lumpenball ' : just . If you want to see a much funnier movie with a similar premise , watch Stan and Ollie in ' Fraternally Yours ' .
419175	1609079	896964	4.0	Who or what is a Cuban Pete ?	IMDb's reviewer " free2emailus " has made a few errors in reviewing this film : the Three Rhythm Boys are dressed as footmen , not butlers ; the little girl Jean has no mother in this film , off-camera or otherwise . Also , the plot centres on an error : even a Brit like me knows that U . S . income-tax auditors did not work for the State Department in 1937 . What most interested me about ' Pot Luck ' is that the chief tax auditor ( oddly named Betts ) is played by character actor Russ Brown . In the 1950s and ' 60s , Brown had a respectable career as a film actor : he sang ' Heart ' in ' Damn Yankees ' , and also had good roles in ' South Pacific ' and ' Advise and Consent ' , so I was very intrigued to see him here as a much younger man . Does the phrase ' Cuban Pete ' have some slang meaning that I don't understand ? It's the title of a song in this mini-musical , but I've also encountered it in more suspicious contexts . My rating for this froth : just .
419289	1609079	21968	5.0	Dooley truly quite unruly .	Ray ( short for Rachael ) Dooley was an extremely talented Scots-born comedienne who was a Broadway star of the 1920s . Like Christine Baranski , Ray Dooley was ( by contemporary accounts ) that rare female combination of funny and sexy in the same woman . With her angular features and acrobatic agility , Dooley performed on stage alongside W . C . Fields , Bob Hope and other major comedians of her day . Regrettably , ' Honeymoon Lane ' was her only-ever film role . She retired from showbiz several years into her lifelong marriage to Eddie Dowling , an all-purpose Broadway talent who had some respectable success as an actor , scriptwriter , director and producer but who was not especially notable in any of those roles . After Dowling's death left her wealthy , Ray Dooley became increasingly inactive in her home in Long Island , New York . My American wife's family lived nearby and knew her well . When I was introduced to Ray Dooley in the early 1980s , I was intrigued to learn that she had a print of ' Honeymoon Lane ' , in which she and her husband had co-starred ( although not as a couple ) . ' Honeymoon Lane ' is allegedly based on Dowling's Broadway hit of the same title . I've read the script of that show ( also thanks to Ray Dooley ) , and the only thing they have in common is that both starred Dowling as a brash Irish-American named Tim . Even his surname was different in the two shows : in the Broadway production , he was cried Tim Murphy . That surname shows up in this movie too , but here Dowling's character is named Tim Dugan . The Murphy clan here are Gerty ( Dooley ) and her mother . Mrs Murphy is the proprietress of a seaside hotel . Her latest guest is none other than the King of Belgravia , who apparently doesn't realise that his kingdom is actually a neighbourhood in south London . It seems that the king has come to this American spa for the healthful waters , and for Mrs Murphy's cherry pies . French actor Armand Kaliz plays the King of Belgravia with one of the more impenetrable accents I've ever had to listen to . Ray Dooley told me she couldn't recall whether it was his real accent or not ; I suspect it wasn't . Into the same hostelry come a bunch of bootleggers with accents that are definitely phony , led by Arnold Bookstein ( clearly based on real-life hoodlum Arnold Rothstein ) . One of the gangsters is played by the spectacularly ugly George Kotsonaros , who looks like a refugee from a horror movie . Oh , yeah : the star of the movie is Eddie Dowling as Tim Dugan , who loves Mary Baggott but is afraid to marry her because her layabout father Tom will move in with them . This movie could have been a lot funnier with the same cast and budget , if it had used a diifferent script ( and a more talented director ) . Since Eddie Dowling wrote the material as well as starring , I suspect that there was an ego problem here : he probably refused to have his script scrapped . I didn't ask Ray Dooley to confirm this . Most annoying of all , the supporting cast of characters actually features a snooty rich dame named Mrs Gotrocks . Where did this stupid name come from ? I've encountered at least ten alleged comedies ( most of them cartoons ) featuring a rich character named Gotrocks . Was that name ever funny ? I doubt it . When I met Ray Dooley , she was well into her eighties . . . yet her humour , warmth , vivacity and considerable presence were unimpaired . Several of her former co-stars - - including W . C . Fields and Bob Hope - - had praised her publicly , speaking very highly of her comedic talents . She showed me her photo album , full of photographs of herself in various stage routines which appeared to be very funny indeed . Her performance in ' Honeymoon Lane ' - - energetic , with a hint of slapstick - - is the movie's high point , and yet she isn't very funny with this weak material . Perhaps if Ray Dooley had been determined to sustain her showbiz career , she could have been another Joan Davis , or a combination of Imogene Coca and Carol Burnett . As things stand , I'll rate this weak comedy . . . more out of sentiment for several of the players , rather than for its actual hilarity .
418870	1609079	61308	5.0	A sobering experience .	I saw ' Twice a Fortnight ' ( which works out to once a week , ha ha ) when it was originally transmitted by the BBC on a weekly basis . The programme lasted precisely five fortnights ( i . e . , ten weekly episodes ) in late 1967 , terminating just before Christmas . In fact , I was a member of the studio audience for one episode , which is noteworthy because of this programme's unusual relationship with its studio audience . As it now stands , the only real achievement of ' Twice a Fortnight ' is that it gave Michael Palin , Terry Jones , Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie a chance to get some television experience , and to make some beginners ' mistakes , before going on to their legendary success in Monty Python ( Palin , Jones ) and the Goodies ( Garden , Oddie ) . The programme was a flop largely because these lads didn't know what they were doing . . . but they learnt very quickly indeed . ( A previous IMDb reviewer , AlaGls1 , is mistaken : Terry Jones and Michael Palin were both on-camera performers in ' Twice a Fortnight ' , although only in the film sequences shot outside the studio . ) Bill Oddie was keen to do a series involving audience participation . This led to the first mistake : the studio audience were seated much nearer to the performers than usual , encouraging the audience to feel that they were part of the comic anarchy . The second mistake was the notion to ' warm up ' the audience by serving drinks to them before the show ( including alcoholic bevvies , if they so chose ) . I think that this idea was down to the director Tony Palmer : at all events , he wasn't the first to try this ; it was previously done by ' That Was the Week that Was ' , which catered for rather a different studio audience . The third mistake - - almost certainly Palmer's - - was the decision to hand round noise-makers to the audience before recording each episode . So , we've got boozed-up audience members , armed with noise-makers and practically sitting in the performers ' laps , whilst encouraging them to join into the insanity . Can you see where this is heading ? One of my least favourite viewing experiences was a midnight screening of ' The Rocky Horror Picture Show ' , in a roomful of idiots intent on proving that they were more clever than the performers . . . only they weren't . I got a very similar sensation while trying to watch ' Twice a Fortnight ' . In several of the episodes which I viewed from home ( in transmission ) , most of the in-studio sequences were almost totally indiscernible , due to the constant whooping , interruptions and unfunny wisecracks of the audience . The single biggest reason why I went down to the Beeb's theatre in Shepherds Bush and joined the studio audience for one of the later episodes was because I was hoping I might get a chance to hear the actors ' dialogue if I was in the same room with them . Some hope ! Fortunately , by that point in the run of the series , the free booze had been curtailed and the audience were comparatively restrained . Only just . The best aspect of the in-studio sequences was that they included performances by really first-rate rock acts . How's this for starters ? The Who , Cream , Cat Stevens , Moody Blues , Small Faces , and Scaffold ( featuring Paul McCartney's brother Mike McGear ) . It was these musical interludes - - and ONLY the musical interludes - - which evoke fond memories of ' Twice a Fortnight ' for me when I'm watching some top-name musical act on ' Saturday Night Live ' . The only resemblance between ' SNL ' and ' Twice a Fortnight ' was the reliable presence of some first-rate rock'n'roll acts . ( And a too-rowdy studio audience drowning them out . ) The comedy sequences performed in the studio for that awful audience were largely dire . In hindsight , they feel like incredibly bad imitations of Monty Python skits . . . generally , the ones featuring two men sitting on stools , one interviewing the other . Perhaps if these skits had been funnier , the studio audience would have been more co-operative . . . and the larger audience watching the transmissions at home would have been able to hear the dialogue . What saved ' Twice a Fortnight ' - - ever so barely - - were the film inserts , which were recorded previously in exterior locations , without any audience apart from a few goggling pedestrians . ( These clips were aired on CC monitors for the studio audience's benefit . ) The funniest film sequence in ' Twice a Fortnight ' was a sketch about midget policemen , played by actual midgets in constable cozzies . Just the sight of a bunch of helmeted midgets wielding truncheons and doing Constable Plod routines ( " Here , now , wot's all this , then ? " ) is hilarious in itself . But this sketch became even weirder ( and funnier ) because the actors performed their movements BACKWARD , while filmed conventionally . The film was then played in reverse , to have the actors moving forward . . . but with a weird alien appearance to their movements which is difficult to describe . If you've seen the Red Dwarf episode ' Backwards ' , you'll recognise the effect I mean . It would be great if Auntie Beeb could issue a ' Twice a Fortnight ' compilation DVD , featuring all of the musical performances and film clips . The studio sketches weren't very funny in the first place , and are made even less tolerable due to the live audience's antics . I'll rate this comedy series - - not very funny , yet historically ( and musically ) important - - .
419169	1609079	74057	5.0	Insert Gallic shrug here .	The title and subtitle of this French miniseries are " Six Times Two ; Over and under the media " . The " six " refers to the fact that there are six episodes ; the " two " has a double meaning . Each of these episodes is a collaboration between two people : Jean-Luc Godard and his long-time partner Anne-Marie Miéville , but the " two " also refers to the fact that each episode has a two-part structure . The individual episodes run 100 minutes each , split almost precisely into two 50-minute sections . Each episode deals with a specific theme - - history , women , labour - - with the first half being an overview of that topic , and the second half being a documentary interview with one person who somehow represents that very broad topic ! This is a thoroughly Gallic documentary series , with everything that the term implies ; despite my passion for Godard's films , I found ' Six Times Two ' to be extremely talkative and static . Reportedly , Godard himself did not have a high opinion of this miniseries .
418784	1609079	148144	5.0	Jeckle stops pretending he's English ; Dimwit gets smart .	' Fishing by the Sea ' is the weird and unfunny title of this fairly funny Heckle and Jeckle cartoon , made very early in their development . The magpies ' voices haven't been established yet ; here , Jeckle speaks in a falsetto that doesn't even pretend to be an English accent , while Heckle's prole voice has just a hint of " duh " dummy quality to it . Dimwit the hound is going fishing . ( Dogs eat fish , eh ? ) Heckle and Jeckle are roommates in this one , sharing a single large birdhouse . ( In ' Rival Romeos ' , they lived next-door over to each other . ) They taunt Dimwit for no particular reason , then try to steal his catch of fish . Something I find intriguing about Heckle and Jeckle is that ( unlike Bugs Bunny ) they tend to initiate the mayhem against other ( more innocent ) characters , and they tend to win every skirmish right up until the end of the toon . . . at which point they tend to receive their well-deserved punishment . SPOILERS COMING . In this one , they end up denuded of their feathers and pursued into the open sea by a tooth-baring whale , while Dimwit enjoys a huge catch of fish . Refreshingly , dim dumb Dimwit comes up trumps through his own ingenuity for once . There are a couple of solid laughs here , but modern fans of Heckle and Jeckle will be put off by the unfamiliar voices they possess in this cartoon . My rating : only . As Dimwit would put it : Duh-uhhh !
418370	1609079	53214	5.0	Double-duty daddy	In the 1950s , Clifton Webb starred in many films for Twentieth-Century Fox . In private life , Webb was ( how can I put this tactfully ? ) a very effeminate bachelor with a serious mother fixation . For some reason , Fox kept trying to convince movie audiences that Clifton Webb was a family man , repeatedly casting him as a husband and father in movies like " Cheaper By the Dozen " , " Titanic " and " Marching Along " . This basic implausibility is strained beyond the breaking point in " The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker " , in which Clifton Webb has two wives at the same go , and a total of seventeen children ! " Pennypacker " was based on a Broadway play written by Liam O'Brien , and this film sticks close to the play . ( On Broadway it starred Burgess Meredith , who would have been a better choice than Webb for this film . ) O'Brien wanted us to accept a bigamist as a sympathetic character , so he stacks the deck by setting the action of this story in the 1890s , and then has Pennypacker espouse some " modern " ideas which were pretty radical at the time , but which we now accept easily . Early on in this film - set in turn-of-the-century Harrisburg , Pennsylvania - Mr Pennypacker ( Webb ) comes out in favour of votes for women , and he also endorses Darwin's theory of evolution . Pennypacker's father-in-law ( Charles Coburn ) and all the other respectable men of 19th-century Harrisburg are shocked by these radical notions , but of course a modern-day movie audience will find them perfectly reasonable . By the time we learn Pennypacker's big secret ( he's a bigamist , and not ashamed of it ) , we're accustomed to seeing him as the sensible free-thinker , and we've been lured into perceiving Pennypacker's father-in-law and all his neighbours as a bunch of old fogeys . We're tricked into accepting Pennypacker's bigamy as a harmless alternative lifestyle . ( By the way : although apparently endorsing bigamy in his play and then this film , author O'Brien was careful to make a public statement that his OWN parents were not bigamists . ) Pennypacker works for his Harrisburg wife's father , in a job which enables Pennypacker to shuttle between Harrisburg and Philadelphia . Nobody suspects that he has a house in each city , with a wife and kids in each house . Even his two wives ( and his two sets of children ) don't suspect each other's existence . The secret leaks out when Pennypacker's Philadelphia house is condemned by the city government , under the laws of eminent domain , to be torn down and replaced by a road . Pennypacker is " away on business " in Harrisburg , so his eldest Philadelphia son travels to his dad's home office in Harrisburg , planning to warn him that his whole houseful of Philadelphia offspring are about to be evicted . There's a clever moment when Webb ( as Pennypacker ) discovers his secret's been rumbled . Presenting himself to Coburn as a loving husband and father , Webb surrounds himself with all the children of his Harrisburg brood , counting them off one by one . . . until he finds one child left over , leading Webb to remark : " Boy , you belong in Philadelphia . " Once the secret's out , Liam O'Brien's script comes up with a clever ( and plausible ) explanation for why Pennypacker can't remember which one of his two wives he married first . SPOILER WARNING : I was disappointed that the play and this film both cheat with their premise . After establishing Pennypacker as a bigamist , the story then reverses itself by revealing that he's only a PAST-tense bigamist . Pennypacker's Philadelphia wife conveniently died several years before the movie begins . Also , we never see any of his Philadelphia children except for his eldest son . Now that Pennypacker is down to his last wife ( in Harrisburg ) , and his Philadelphia brood are on the brink of eviction from their house , it's pretty obvious how this situation is going to be resolved . . . Character actress Doro Merande , whose annoying voice ruined the soundtracks of many Fox films from the 1930s onwards , is her usual annoying self in a brief role here . " The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker " isn't very remarkable , but it's a competent treatment of an unusual subject . I'll rate this movie .
418401	1609079	12482	5.0	Passable ' Pim ' , possibly past .	A . A . Milne is of course remembered for ' Winnie the Pooh ' , but during his lifetime he was known for a wide range of writings . He regularly contributed humour pieces to ' Punch ' magazine , and his novel ' The Red House Mystery ' ( a whodunit that's also a howdunit ) was in the 1930s considered one of the great works of detective fiction . ( It is now seriously dated . ) Milne was a striking figure , with his blond hair and piercing bright blue eyes : for maximum effect , he often dressed in suits of the exact same distinctive blue as his eyes , and he was nicknamed ' Blue ' by his friends because of this . Milne was also a playwright of some success in his lifetime ; here too , his work has sadly dated . Milne first achieved success as the author of ' Toad of Toad Hall ' , a stage dramatisation of Kenneth Grahame's classic ' The Wind in the Willows ' . This was Milne's favourite novel , and he would often appraise new acquaintances by mentioning ' Willows ' in the conversation so that he could observe their response . It's notable that Milne's books about Pooh and Christopher Robin are illustrated by Ernest Shepherd , who had previously illustrated ' The Wind in the Willows ' . ' Mr Pim Passes By ' is the film version of one of Milne's more successful plays . The opening credits list Milne's play as the source , but ( in the print I screened ) no scenarist is identified as author of the adaptation . Milne's stage play is an unfortunate vehicle for adaptation as a silent film , as most of the humour in this comedy of manners derives from the dialogue . This film ( by a director unknown to me ) features many , many intertitles with long , long pieces of dialogue in them . . . but I don't believe that the director or scenarist should be blamed ; this particular material just doesn't work very well without audible voices handling the dialogue . ' Pim ' is a comedy of a very English sort , and even in England this type of humour is no longer in fashion . Olivia Marsden was formerly married to Jacob Tellworthy , but he died during a period when they were physically separated , so she only learnt of his death second-hand . ( They were emotionally estranged all along . ) Five years ago , she married the much older George Marsden : a wealthy skinflint from a blueblood family , who rules Marsden House ( his stately home ) as an absolute tyrant . Olivia has no say in the household's affairs , no power over her own life . Neither does her daughter Diana , who is in love with the aptly-named Brian Strange . . . who is meant to be a sympathetic character ( the juvenile lead ) , yet whom I despised straight off . Brian Strange is one of those sensitive young artists who insist on painting landscapes that don't resemble anything seen in nature . ( One intertitle identifies him as a ' modernist ' . ) George Marsden absolutely dominates his wife and stepdaughter , and forbids Diana to have any contact with Strange . One day , into Marsden House ambles the absent-minded Mr Pim , seeking an introduction to the neighbour next-door over . Overhearing a reference to Jacob Tellworthy , he speaks of him in the present tense . It seems that Tellworthy is in fact alive ; Mr Pim knows him quite well , and saw him only just recently . Having dropped this bombshell , Mr Pim ambles off . Olivia and her oh-so-very respectable husband ( to say nothing of his mother , the dowager Lady Marsden ) are scandalised to learn that their marriage is illegal , and that Olivia is guilty of bigamy . Now along comes Mr Pim again , with a new bit of information . It seems that Tellworthy was indeed alive all these years , but he has just lately died . Olivia is indeed a widow , but she and Marsden have been living together all these years in an illegal marriage . Scandalous ! Having dropped this second bombshell , Mr Pim once again ambles off . By pulling a few strings , Marsden contrives to file a backdated marriage certificate . But Olivia refuses to consent to this . SPOILERS COMING . Realising that Marsden is desperate to remarry her ( for the sake of his own reputation ) , Olivia renegotiates the terms of their marriage : she will receive more household money and some new drapes . Oh , and while he's about it , Marsden is to consent to his stepdaughter Diana's engagement to that modernist ' artist ' . Happy endings all round ( for all except Marsden ) . . . and now once again Mr Pim passes by . It seems he's just remembered that the fellow he knew wasn't Jacob Tellworthy after all . It was someone named Polwittle ! ' Mr Pim Passes By ' does not make a wholly successful transfer to the silent screen , as it is dependent upon so much dialogue that must be read in the intertitles . All of the actors give good performances ; in one case , perhaps too good . Henry Kendall succeeds so thoroughly in conveying the arty-tarty pretensions of the ' modernist ' painter Strange , he makes it clear that Strange is a dilettante and that Marsden is absolutely right to thwart his romance with Marsden's stepdaughter . I was disappointed that Diana is permitted to throw her life away on this berk . Campbell Gullan is doddering and indecisive in the title role , but that's appropriate to the character . In all , I'll rate ' Mr Pim Passes By ' .
418373	1609079	21872	6.0	Face the camera , Gracie .	George Burns wants to buy a necktie ( hence this film's title ) but runs afoul of a shopgirl who speaks in extreme 1920s slang . ( He also meets a shopgirl with a very proper English accent . ) He claims to be the nephew of the store's owner , but this is clearly a ploy to get some service , as a moment later he asks who owns the store . A floorwalker cuts off the tie George is wearing so he can match it with one in stock . Just when things can't possibly get any screwier , George meets Gracie . . . ' Fit to Be Tied ' is a very crude comedy short : at one point , the camera adjusts itself during a shot . There's a reference to Elinor Glyn's steamy novel ' Three Weeks ' that will baffle modern viewers . But the byplay between George and Gracie is funny . Gracie Allen's speaking voice annoys me , but here - - singing ' I'm a Whole Lot Wilder Than I Know ' - - she reveals an excellent singing voice . Oddly , the director films her in three-quarter view during this sequence , rather than full-on . . . was Gracie perhaps worried that the monochrome film would reveal that her eyes were two different colours ? The first nine minutes of this 10-minute short are delightful , but the ending is weak . George and Gracie , having run out of material , simply face the camera and wave goodbye ! I'll rate this one .
419225	1609079	30186	6.0	Joe E . Brown as Clark Kent	' The Gladiator ' , by Philip Wylie , was a serious science-fiction novel about a man who is scientifically enhanced with superhuman powers . Although a minor novel , Wylie's book is extremely significant because it inspired two teenagers from Cleveland named Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to create their comic-book character Superman . The 1938 movie ' The Gladiator ' ( released barely two months after Superman's comic-book debut ) is ostensibly based on Wylie's deadpan novel , but the original premise has been drastically rewritten as a comedy vehicle for Joe E . Brown . Given the strange decision to play this story for laughs , Brown is an excellent choice for the role . Joe E . Brown had a great deal in common with Buster Keaton , beyond the fact that they both had a drinking problem which led to both of them ( consecutively ) falling into the clutches of the same woman : a detox-ward nurse named Mae Scrivens . Keaton and Brown were both Midwesterners who performed professionally from early childhood . Both were small men who looked like weaklings , but both were actually acrobats with prodigious physical strength . On screen , Joe E . Brown often played ineffectual men . . . so the effect was startling when he would suddenly execute a cartwheel or some other acrobatic stunt . In vaudeville , Brown worked with the professional wrestler Man Mountain Dean in a stage act in which little Joe E . would lift the huge Man Mountain over his head with only one hand . This stunt was absolutely genuine , with nothing faked . Brown repeats it in this movie , with Man Mountain Dean playing himself . . . but because this is a movie , audiences will assume there must be some sort of trickery going on . The biggest difference between Keaton and Brown on screen is that Keaton was resolutely unsentimental , whereas Joe E . Brown was usually much TOO sentimental . In a blatant bid for audience sympathy , Joe E . starts this movie in a hospital ward , where he is telling bedtime stories to little crippled boys ! Soon afterwards he is sent on an errand which requires him to enter a cinema . . . but the movie house is holding Bank Night , and Joe E . accidentally wins $1 , 500 . ( Nowadays nobody knows what Bank Night is . ) Apparently $1 , 500 is enough money in 1938 to buy a college education , so Joe E . straightaway enrols in college . . . hoping to get an education so he can earn lots of money and adopt crippled orphan Dickie Moore . ( Full disclosure : I interviewed the grown-up Moore several years ago , while he was running a publicity agency in New York City . He's a fine man and is very embarrassed by some of his child-actor performances . ) On campus , Joe E . meets a crazy scientist ( played by the brilliant character actor Lucien Littlefield , who also played the mad scientist in Laurel and Hardy's ' Dirty Work ' ) . Littlefield has invented a super-serum , which he injects into a monkey , causing the monkey to act like a gorilla . While Joe E . is asleep , Littlefield jabs him with the super-soup . Joe E . wakes up with super-powers , and with no idea how he got them . When a college student wakes up with super-powers that could be used for the benefit of all humanity , of course he has to try out for Varsity . Soon Joe E . is the big man on campus , winning letters in every known sport . Bland actress June Travis plays a pretty co-ed who dislikes Joe E . but is persuaded to pretend to like him for the good of the team . ( Later , of course , her phony feelings become genuine . . . ) SLIGHT SPOILERS NOW . There are some funny sequences in which the befuddled Joe E . shows off his newfound super-strength , and Joe E . Brown's genuine athleticism ( in a seemingly unathletic body ) is shown to fine advantage here . The funniest moment comes during a wrestling match with Man Mountain Dean , when Joe E . ' s super-strength suddenly wears off at the worst possible moment . ' The Gladiator ' is a good film , not a great one , and I'll rate it . Watching this movie , I wish that somebody had done a straight version of Philip Wylie's original novel , which made some intelligent observations . This movie replaces Wylie's themes with easy slapstick and cheap sentiment .
418616	1609079	27806	6.0	Unfunny ' honey , I'm home ' sitcom .	' Is My Husband Not Fabulous ? ' would be the literal translation of this German film's title . ' Ist mein Mann nicht fabelhaft ? ' was produced in Germany a few months after Hitler became Chancellor . This marital comedy is such light-hearted froth that I'm tempted to say that Hitler's regime hadn't yet cast its shadow over the German film industry at this early point . However , I've seen quite a few German comedies from the later 1930s and the war years , and I can assure you : even when the Nazis had a firm grip on the German and Austrian film industry , the production companies were still churning out light-hearted froth like this movie . ( Yes , of course there were also propaganda movies . . . but there were also plenty of German films in this period which contained NO references to Nazism , Hitler , lebensraum , anti-Semitism or any of the other problems of that time . ) In hindsight , it would be very interesting to know the mindset of contemporary German and Austrian cinema audiences when they stepped out of the Third Reich for an hour or so to watch one of these frothy comedies on a flickering screen : Were they seeking escapism from the very real problems in their society ? Or were they wilfully blind to the increasing horror , just as many of them were wilfully blind when their non-Aryan neighbours suddenly disappeared ? Anyway , there's none of that heavy stuff in this light-hearted film . Viktor and Lu Brandt are happy newlyweds , and Viktor ( handsome Georg Alexander ) has a fine job as publicity director for a large music store . But he's so attentive to his wife ( Lien Deyers , quite pretty ) that it affects his work performance . His hot-headed boss demotes him to floorwalker , or whatever the German equivalent of a floorwalker is , with a cut in his wages . This movie being about as realistic as an ' I Love Lucy ' episode , Viktor deals with his demotion by telling Lu that he's been promoted to general manager ! ( She doesn't express much curiosity about the extra pfennigs he's now supposedly earning . . . nor does this movie explain how the Brandt household manages to carry on at the same level with LESS money in Viktor's wage packet . ) Of course , Lu unexpectedly shows up at the shop to see her husband in his fine new executive job which he doesn't actually have . From this point , the movie degenerates into one of those sitcom episodes where the lowly underling has to pretend he's a bigshot in the workplace . Some of the female employees conspire with Viktor to help him deceive his wife that he's the general manager . These women are attractive , so it's interesting that neither the audience nor Viktor's wife ever suspect that he might be philandering with any of them , or hoping to do so . SPOILERS COMING . Anyway , it just happens that Viktor has a fine heldentenor singing voice , and it further just happens that his boss needs a new singer at the precise moment when the regular singer ( Marcel Wittrisch ) can't perform . So of course there's a happy ending . Ignore those jackboots you hear approaching in the distance . . . and the sound of breaking glass . It's all nothing , really . This is Germany , 1933 . Laugh and be gay ! Well , not gay , but . . . Trude Hesterberg gives a very funny and touching performance as a faded diva , but Martha Ziegler is far less effective ( and slightly too old for the role ) as her daughter . There's some pleasant music in this movie , but - - from my 21st-century perspective - - most of ' Is My Husband Not Fabulous ? ' feels like a very stale ' Honey , I'm home ' sitcom . . . and I strongly suspect that , had I seen this movie in 1933 , with the perceptions of the times and no precognition , it would have seemed much the same . The German movie companies were still churning out this sort of froth six years later . My rating for this one : , mostly for the actors ' performances ( despite the trite script ) and some nice exterior photography .
419361	1609079	157321	6.0	All about Bacall	' Applause ' was a Broadway musical based on the cult movie ' All About Eve ' , but it differs significantly from that film . After Lauren Bacall starred as Margo Channing in ' Applause ' on Broadway , she repeated her starring role in the West End production of that show in London . In one of the most ironic casting choices in history , Bacall was replaced in the Broadway cast by Anne Baxter . In the film ' All About Eve ' , Baxter had played Eve Harrington , the would-be actress who schemed to take over Margo Channing's life . In the cast of ' Applause ' , Baxter finally got that chance . ' All About Eve ' and ' Applause ' were indirectly based on a true incident in the career of European actress Elisabeth Bergner . Screenwriter Joseph L Mankiewicz borrowed the name ' Eve Harrington ' from the Preston Sturges film ' The Lady Eve ' , in which a scheming woman named Harrington uses ' Eve ' as her criminal alias . I was peripherally involved in the London production of ' Applause ' , as a minor staffer in the producer's office . In 1973 , I hadn't yet seen the film ' All About Eve ' , and I couldn't understand why there was so much fuss over this movie . One of the songs in ' Applause ' is called ' Fasten Your Seat Belts ( It's going to be a bumpy night ) ' , but the song is performed at a party and has nothing to do with air travel . I didn't understand at the time that this song was inspired by a famous line in the original film . ' All About Eve ' begins with a ceremony for the Sarah Siddons Award . This was ( at the time ) a fictional award named for a real stage actress ; following the film's success , there is now a genuine Sarah Siddons Award . For the Broadway and London stage productions of ' Applause ' ( and this TV version ) , the trophy was changed to the Tony Award , with permission from the American Theatre Wing ( who give out the real Tony Awards ) . In the opening scene of the stage musical , there was an awkward tech cue as we hear the thoughts of famed actress Margo Channing ( Bacall ) in pre-recorded voice-over . This was done much more easily in the TV version . Bacall waves a Tony Award overhead , wearing a sleeveless gown that gives us a full view of her shaved armpits . The camera shifts into slo-mo , to make sure we don't miss those armpits . She then goes to a party where the guests engage in peculiar scat-singing . ( ' Ba-ba-bee-ba ! ' ) ' Applause ' is notable for having a script by Broadway veterans Betty Comden and Adolph Green but songs by Lee Adams and Charles Strouse , the team best known for the score of ' Bye Bye Birdie ' . Comden and Green usually wrote the lyrics for their scripts ; for ' Applause ' , they were brought into the project after Adams and Strouse had written a score . What is it about gay men and aging actresses ? For reasons that elude me , the movie ' All About Eve ' is some sort of gay rite of passage . The musicals of Comden and Green contain large amounts of material that's gay-friendly , but not explicitly so . ' Applause ' is the exception . With its background of Broadway musicals , the gay aspects of the New York theatre get far more than a look-in here . In the original film , Margo Channing's dresser was an older woman ; in ' Applause ' , this character is a handsome young man named Duane Fox . She invites him to escort her to an after-theatre party . When Duane demurs that he's got a date , Bacall theatrically tosses her long tawny hair and says ' Bring him along ! ' . The most bizarre scene in this TV special occurs when gayboy Duane brings Margo to his favourite bar in Greenwich Village , where lots of good-looking young men want to meet this aging actress . ( Not another woman is in sight ; I guess none of these guys can get a girlfriend . ) Bacall performs a musical number in front of a wall of multi-coloured neon lights , each light forming a letter of the alphabet . These letters appear to be randomly scattered across the wall , but if you follow them in a knight's tour they spell out " GAY POWER " , with one extra letter as a decoy . As Margo leaves , a young man named Danny shouts : ' I love her ! ' A far more enjoyable number is the title song , performed by would-be actors who work as waiters and waitresses at Joe Allen's . ( In the 1970s , this was a real restaurant in the Broadway theatre district , noted for its distinctive red and white tablecloths . ) For Bacall's pleasure , all the boys and girls at Joe Allen's perform an elaborate dance number referencing other Broadway musicals , ranging from ' Oklahoma ! ' to ' Oh Calcutta ! ' . There's some contrived dialogue here that wasn't in the movie . When Karen Richards feels guilt for draining the gas tank of Margo's car , she imagines she hears comments about this . ( " You're a gas ! " " T'anks ! " ) More enjoyable is a scene that wasn't in ' All About Eve ' , with Karen and her husband Buzz ( named ' Lloyd ' in the movie ) attending a party . All the guests wear signs on their backs , with each sign bearing the name of a famous person . Since no guest can read his own sign , they must respond to clues from other guests to learn who they are . ' Applause ' is a good ( but not great ) musical , adapted from a movie that worked better as a film . The best elements here are direct references to Broadway's theatre community that weren't in the film , such as the gypsy-robe scene and the gay subculture . But ' Applause ' can never be revived except as a period piece , since it makes absolutely no mention of Aids . I'll rate this enjoyable TV version , and I wish someone would explain to me why gay men are so fascinated by aging actresses .
419327	1609079	209397	6.0	He pants for his trousers .	I saw ' Seraphin ; or , The Naked Legs ' in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone , Italy . The festival screened a print on loan from Cinémathèque Française , Paris . Georges Biscot ( who stars in this crude comedy ) became a film comedian by an unusual route : he started out in the movies as a film technician ( for Pathé ) , then worked as a music-hall projectionist before France had purpose-made cinemas . While watching the live acts in the Bobino music hall , Biscot caught the stage bug and became a variety performer . In 1916 , while impersonating Chaplin's tramp ( ! ) , Biscot was discovered by Jacques Feyder and given a film contract . Between May 1921 and February 1922 , Louis Feuillade starred Biscot in six comedy shorts , all filmed in Nice . These movies were popular and financially successful , but Biscot played an entirely different character in each film . . . thus he failed to develop the momentum of film comedians such as Chaplin - - or Biscot's compatriot André Deed - - who sustained a recognisable characterisation through a series of movies . In this one , Biscot plays Seraphin , the very proper and dignified manager of an accident-insurance company . Unfortunately for Seraphin ( but fortunately for us ) , he suffers a series of accidents which not only humiliate him but also require his company to make payments to beneficiaries . Feuillade ( who wrote the script as well as directed ) and Biscot do a fine job of escalating the indignities in this 37-minute comedy , so that Seraphin's humiliations get steadily worse . Unfortunately , this film's title gives away the ending : as his crowning indignity , Seraphin loses his trousers ! ( Only four years later , Harold Lloyd - - while shooting ' The Freshman ' - - had to be persuaded by his writers to do a similar gag ; Lloyd considered the joke a very corny one indeed . ) What lifts Biscot's performance above the work of Brian Rix and other trouser-losers is that Seraphin undergoes the semi-novelty of losing his trousers in the middle of a public street , rather than indoors . Still , it was already a VERY old gag in 1921 , and the ' climactic ' gag of this comedy is something of an anticlimax . I laughed at this comedy - - Feuillade's and Biscot's talents are clearly displayed at this early point - - but I don't believe that it deserves better than a rating of .
418208	1609079	22553	6.0	She's a winner , Max is a whiner and Jacob's a weiner .	Jenny Jugo was a Teutonic brunette who specialised in light comedy ingenue roles , similar to Deanna Durbin but with less singing . Well into her forties , Jugo exhibited a girlish quality and an easy grace that enabled her to give excellent and believable performances in roles for which she was frankly too old . ' Wer Nimmt die Liebe ernst . . . ' would translate as ' Who holds love earnestly ? ' The ellipsis in the film's opening credits refers to the fact that this title is also the first line of a song performed during the film . Since there's no question mark here , I wonder if German film producers share the superstition of their Hollywood counterparts , holding that a question mark in a film's title will bring bad luck . ( Thus we get movies such as ' Who Framed Roger Rabbit ' . . . in which the title is a question but there's no question mark . ) Handsome Max and clever-clogs Jacob live in Berlin , where they are a couple of . . . well , I'm not sure of the Berliner word for these boyos , but in London we'd call them wide boys . A wide boy is a sharp young hustler who usually stays just wide of the law ( hence the name ) : he'll try any money-making dodge that doesn't involve hard work or long hours , and it's only coincidence that most of the jobs in that category are illegal . After arousing the wrath of the police , Max and Jacob split up and flee in separate directions . With the police closing in on him , handsome Max ducks into a small flat which turns out to be the bedsit of pretty Ilse ( Jugo ) . Just as the two of them are about to ' meet cute ' , in walks Ilse's landlady ( Hedwig Wangel ) . Finding a man in Ilse's room , this hausfrau jumps to the most obvious conclusion and decides that Ilse is a prostitute . The landlady chucks out Ilse and Max . Having inadvertently got Ilse evicted , Max decides to make it up to her by taking her to a fun fair ( no comment ) . Max finds himself attracted to Ilse : she , understandably , is annoyed at the trouble he's caused her . At the fun fair , someone suggests that Ilse should enter the beauty contest which is conveniently just about to start . Ilse is skint and needs money , so she enters the contest hoping to win a useful prize . SPOILERS COMING . Here I should say something about actress Jugo's looks . Although she certainly wasn't ugly , she was only moderately pretty even by the standards of the 1930s . In a beauty contest with a large field of contestants ( like the one shown in this movie ) , it's unlikely that she would have won . SPOILERS NOW . But win she does , and straight away Ilse is hustled off to a prize-winner's feast . The contest judges glance at Max's shabby clothes , and make it plain he's not welcome to join the feast . Nor does Ilse speak up on his behalf . Max was beginning to hope that Ilse might reciprocate his feelings : now he realises otherwise . And the carnival's band is conveniently playing ' Wer Nimmt die Liebe ernst ? ' , whch Max sorrowfully adopts as his own philosophy . This movie is froth , so the ending is what you'd expect . Max wanders about Berlin feeling sorry for himself , then eventually returns to his flat . . . to find Ilse waiting for him . ( If he ever told her his address during the movie's dialogue , I must have missed it in the poor sound recording . ) I will cynically point out that Ilse's sudden interest in Max might be down to her no longer having a place to live . I'll rate this movie , mostly for Jugo's endearing personality , some attractive fun-fair sequences , and a few pleasant tunes .
419495	1609079	24656	6.0	If it wasn't for those pesky kids . . .	Cecil B . DeMille had a long and mutually profitable relationship with Paramount , interrupted by a brief falling-out with Adolph Zukor , during which DeMille made a few films at MGM in the early sound era . . . including his weirdest and most atypical film , ' Madam Satan ' . ' This Day and Age ' was made shortly after DeMille's return to Paramount ; it's only slightly less weird ( and slightly less atypical of DeMille ) than ' Madam Satan ' . In the early 1930s , a few Hollywood films took the bizarre view that , since organised crime had reached such high proportions in the USA , the only sensible solution was for civil liberties to be suspended so that criminals could be punished without the minor inconvenience of the Bill of Rights . ' Gabriel Over the White House ' is probably the best-known ( and most excessive ) example of that brief genre . ' This Day and Age ' , made the same year , takes a similar tone : this is arguably DeMille's most Fascist film . SPOILERS FOLLOW . The action takes place in a typical California city , where the high-school boys like to spend their time getting their trousers pressed in the local shop of their friend Herman , a Jewish tailor who feeds them hummus while they sit in his shop in their underpants . ( Herman is played by Harry Green , who often played extremely offensive Jewish stereotypes , but who is more sympathetic than usual here . ) Local gangster Garrett ( Charles Bickford , very good ) has been leaning on Herman to pay protection money . When Herman refuses , Garrett blows up Herman's shop ( with Herman inside ) while a roller-skating act at Garrett's speakeasy provides his alibi . Three of the local boys decide to break into Garrett's hideout to find evidence linking him to Herman's murder . There's a clever scene transition : as the three lads break into the building , we cut to a floor show at Garrett's club , where chorus girls are singing ' Three Blind Mice ' . Garrett's goons catch the boys , and one boy gets shot dead . Instead of going to the cops , the surviving boys decide to catch Garrett and his thugs by themselves . From this point , the film becomes wildly implausible yet increasingly fascinating . Refreshingly , one of the boys in the high-school class is black : even more refreshingly , he's well-spoken and studious . Regrettably , this teenager must do a ' yassuh ' routine as a shoeshine boy in order to help trap Garrett . ( I consider this painful sequence a fair reflection of social roles at the time , not a flaw of this film . ) The most implausible part of the plot occurs when Don , the leader of the boys , recruits his good-girl teenage sister ( with the unfortunate forename Gay ) to come the slut and seduce one of Garrett's henchmen . Shortly before he goes for the jail-bait , this gangster helps himself to an olive while remarking ' I like my olives green , ' ( Oh , such subtle symbolism . ) Just as he's about to do the deed with Gay , he suddenly learns that she's a virgin . . . leading him to a change of heart and the remark : ' I like my olives green . . . but I don't pick ' em myself . ' Let me see if I have it straight : this guy has no compunction about seducing underage girls , but only providing they're not virgins . I found this unlikely , yet I'm impressed that one of the villains turned out to have a streak of decency . The screenwriter could have taken the easy way out by making all the villains one-dimensional characters . John Carradine appears briefly in the opening scene of this film , but he has very little to do , and Carradine cultists will be disappointed . A few other veteran character actors are likewise on hand here , yet likewise neglected . I was intrigued to see someone named ' Frank Tinney , Junior ' in the cast list . I assume that he was the son of Frank Tinney , a major vaudeville comedian / monologist who did almost no film work . Tinney ( senior ) had an unsavoury reputation in New York theatre circles , because of his penchant for visiting bordellos where he ( shall we say ) ' damaged the goods ' . That sort of sleazy behaviour is very similar to some of what's depicted onscreen in ' This Day and Age ' . I'll rate this well-made monstrosity .
418211	1609079	416012	7.0	Mickey Rooney ( herself ) as Mary Pickford !	The Mickey McGuire series of comedy shorts were a spin-off from ' The Toonerville Trolley ' , an extremely popular daily comic panel written and drawn by Fontaine Fox . ( There was also ' Toonerville Folks ' , a Sunday strip version . ) Basically , small-town Toonerville was its own little universe , and the gentle humour of the feature dealt with the antics of the various denizens . . . such as the Powerful Katrinka and the Skipper ( the long-bearded driver of the trolley ) . One of the most prominent characters was a bowler-hatted Irish-American urchin who bullied the other children , and who - - because of his sense of self-importance - - was always known as Mickey ( Himself ) McGuire . Fontaine Fox had a bizarre tendency to draw his ' Toonerville ' panel from a three-quarter view in midair . The humour of the Toonerville Trolley ( which I never liked ) was a bit too rarefied to make a transition to films : Fontaine Fox made a few animated cartoons and live shorts , but they never matched the success of his syndicated drawings . What did succeed was the decision to make Mickey ( Himself ) McGuire the star of a series of low-budget live-action shorts , getting into adventures with other back-alley kids . A vaudeville comedian named Joe Yule brought his young son Joe Jnr to audition for the role : Joe Jnr got the part , and was promptly renamed Mickey McGuire . Later , when the boy actor and the role parted company , Fontaine Fox would not allow the juvenile to continue performing under that name . . . so Joe Yule Jnr changed his name again , to Mickey Rooney ! The Mickey McGuire shorts have a very similar feel to the Hal Roach studio's Our Gang shorts ( made during the same time period ) , and have many of the same flaws . . . including racist gags at the expense of the black member of the gang ( in Mickey's case , an African-American boy who rejoiced in the name Hambone Johnson ) . Another of Mickey's sidekicks was boy midget Billy Barty , whose physique ( at this early age ) is already visible stunted . In the sound era , the Mickey McGuire shorts began to vary somewhat from the Our Gangs by placing increasing reliance on ' impossible ' gags requiring trick photography . . . probably not a good decision , since even the original Toonerville comic panels featured semi-realistic situations . The McGuire shorts benefit from the strong presence and talent of the young Mickey Rooney . " Mickey's Movies " is one of the late silent McGuire shorts . As usual , Mickey makes all the decisions , and the other kids merely go along for the fun . This time round , Mickey has decided that the kids should start their own movie studio . . . and he naturally considers himself the most qualified person to take charge of production , because of his contacts in the film industry : namely , his father once met somebody who shook hands with Charlie Chaplin . And not content with being the producer , Mickey naturally believes he should play all the lead roles too . There's one very bizarre sequence here , when Mickey tries to impress the other kids with his thespian abilities . He rushes offstage , then instantly returns dressed as a little girl , in a short frock and a blonde wig of long sausage curls ! Mickey ( or Michaela ? ) simpers back and forth for a few seconds , challenging the other kids to guess who he is now . The answer Mickey expects ( as we find out in a later intertitle ) is ' Mary Pickford ' . . . but before we get there , another boy leaps up and replies ' LON CHANEY ! ' What makes this gag so bizarre is that Mickey Rooney ( 8 years old at the time ) looks EXACTLY like a girl in this Goldilocks get-up . Also , I can't help wondering how a tough little mug like Mickey McGuire just happens to have a complete set of girls ' clothes ( and a wig ) handy . Maybe Mickey ( Himself ) McGuire should change his nickname to ' Herself ' . I'll rate this short .
419343	1609079	17585	7.0	Master comedian , good comedy	Raymond Griffith was a very popular comedian of the late silent era , who is now forgotten because very few of his films have survived . He also embodies the cliché of the silent-film star whose voice is inappropriate for talkies : due to a bronchial ailment , Griffith could not speak above a whisper . After a couple of brief sound-film appearances , Griffith went on to a successful career as a producer at 20th Century-Fox . Griffith usually played a top-hatted , opera-cloaked sharpster who is always one jump ahead of everybody else in the movie . In " You'd Be Surprised " his character is a bit more flappable than usual : a jug falls on his head , a door hits him in the face , and a bullet narrowly misses him . " You'd Be Surprised " is a neat comedy which may have inspired the board game Clue ( or Cluedo , as we call it in Britain ) . " You'd Be Surprised " features a murder at a posh party , and ( just like in Cluedo ) most of the suspects are named for colours : White , Brown , Grey , Green . The entire film takes place aboard a houseboat , during a party in which the host is murdered and the famous Sultana diamond necklace is stolen . All the evidence points to Dorothy Sebastian as the murderer . But she can't possibly be guilty , because she's a beautiful young woman . . . and the rules of film comedy dictate that beautiful young women are never guilty of murder . Griffith plays the coroner who wants to solve the murder in a hurry , because he's got tickets to the opera . This film is quite funny , and it benefits from Griffith's typically surreal lapses of logic . At one point , he steps out of the room and returns a moment later with six people ( chosen at random ) who will serve as the coroner's jury . How he managed to find these people aboard a houseboat is never explained . One of the jurors is an Italian hot-dog vendor who looks and acts remarkably like Chico Marx . . . and he keeps Griffith supplied with hot dogs ( with mustard and sauerkraut ) all during the murder inquest . An ironic footnote : the silent-film actor Granville Redmond , who plays a phony deaf-mute in this movie , actually was a deaf-mute . Like Griffith's stardom , Redmond's career was ruined by the arrival of talkies . One of the most ironic moments in silent-film history occurs late in " You'd Be Surprised " , as Redmond and Griffith hold a normal conversation on screen : since this is a silent film , we don't realise that ( in real life ) Griffith didn't have a voice and Redmond wasn't able to hear him anyway ! Richard Arlen ( who would star in " Wings " less than a year later ) makes a brief uncredited appearance in " You'd Be Surprised " as a crime photographer , and he demonstrates real star presence in his small role . The title cards were co-written by Robert Benchley , whose low-key comedy style was similar to Griffith's . SPOILER : " You'd Be Surprised " claims to be a comedy whodunnit , but the solution to the " mystery " is arbitrary and disappointing . Griffith grabs a party guest seemingly at random , and denounces him as the murderer . . . but we never see Griffith's process of deduction . Still , this is a comedy , and it's pretty funny , so I'll rate " You'll Be Surprised " and recommend it to all lovers of silent-film comedy .
419414	1609079	4209	7.0	Japanese Comanches .	I saw ' The Last of the Line ' in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . They screened a print on loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City . The original credits list an actor with the Victorian-style billing of ' Mr Bingham ' - - no forename , just Mister Bingham - - in the role of the cavalry colonel . By modern standards , it would be easy to dismiss ' The Last of the Line ' as creaky , and to accuse this film of perpetrating racial stereotypes about Amerindians . In fact , I felt that this frontier drama made an honest and intelligent attempt to address a subject which the United States and its people have never truly confronted : the difficult balancing act of fully including the Amerindians into the nation's mainstream without the loss of their native culture . Chief Grey Otter is an Amerindian tribal leader living near a white settlement . He has the foresight to recognise that the white settlers are an increasing presence in this region , and that amicable co-existence is the best option available to his own people . Accordingly , he has sent his son Tiah ( Sessue Hayakawa ) away to be educated at a ' government school ' , so that Tiah will become acclimated to the ways of the white people and will be able ( as Grey Otter's heir and successor ) to lead the next generation of his own people with the benefit of knowledge of the white people's ways . However , while Tiah was at the school , he was taunted as a ' bad Indian ' . He is embittered towards the white people , and believes that the two cultures cannot co-exist . Tiah gathers a group of like-minded renegades , and they attack a stagecoach en route to the white settlement . The stagecoach has an escort of cavalry riders ; some of the cavalrymen shoot it out with the renegades while the rest head towards the cavalry fort . SPOILERS NOW . Grey Otter arrives at the attack just as Tiah is about to shoot the cavalry commander . Without any hesitation , Grey Otter shoots his own son dead . The other renegades ride off . Aware that the rest of the cavalry will arrive soon , Grey Otter arranges his son's corpse so that it looks as if he died defending the coach . When the cavalrymen arrive , they recognise Tiah as Grey Otter's son who was about to return from the government school . Grey Otter's ruse succeeds ; the cavalrymen respect Tiah as an heroic defender of the white settlers , and he is buried with military honours . Oh , dear . I'm sure that a lot of cynical people will dismiss this film as chock-full of clichés . The cavalry to the rescue ! Cheee-yarrrge ! However , it's possible that in 1914 some of those tropes weren't ossified into clichés yet . I'm not a major fan of Westerns , but I give this film credit for an attempt to depict the Amerindians honestly , with less patronisation than usual . It's notable that Grey Otter is able to deceive the white people , and the film is staged and directed to give Grey Otter the audience's sympathy . Most of the actors playing Amerindians in this movie do indeed seem to be racially authentic , and their distinctive facial structures and cheekbones photograph well . The casting of the Issei Japanese actor Hayakawa as a Plains Amerindian actually works well , and Hayakawa's considerable acting talent overrides any ethnic conflicts . Although the role of Tiah is nominally a villainous one , Hayakawa brings sympathy to the role : he wouldn't have become a ' bad Indian ' if the whites hadn't taunted him . Another Issei actor , Tsuru Aoki , is good as one of the renegades . I'll rate this film .
418464	1609079	34890	7.0	George Brent pulls the stops out .	The film ' In This Our Life ' is adapted from the novel of the same name by Ellen Glasgow ( 1873-1945 ) , whose novels had healthy sales figures during her lifetime , yet who is now almost totally forgotten . Her own life was extremely unhappy , largely due to unpleasant memories of her abusive father . ( In her will , Glasgow stipulated that she was not to be buried in the same cemetery as her father . ) If she is remembered at all nowadays , she is classified as both a ' Southern ' author and a feminist . A life-long Virginian , Glasgow typically set her stories in that state . This is the second film directed by John Huston , following his impressive debut with ' The Maltese Falcon ' . Considering how far removed the subject matter is from Huston's usual territory , he does an impressive job here . More about Huston a bit later . Here we have Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland as sisters , and there are no prizes for guessing which is the bad sister and which is the good ' un . The sisters are named Stanley and Roy , but there's no sexual subtext for those male names . The bad sister , having dumped her boring fiancé ( George Brent ) , sets her cap for the good sister's handsome husband ( Dennis Morgan ) . In her later years , Bette Davis occasionally gave informal talks at colleges in California . My future sister-in-law was present at one of these . During the Q & A , an eager fan breathlessly pointed out that Bette Davis had co-starred with Bogart , Cagney , Spencer Tracy , Ronald Reagan , Errol Flynn and other great male stars . . . so , who was her favourite ? Without hesitation , Davis replied ' George Brent ' , leaving most of the audience to murmur ' Who ? ' . It's not hard to guess the reason for Bette's preference . Brent was a bland leading man who concentrated on making his leading ladies look good , never generating a screen presence with the wattage of Bogart or Cagney . Davis preferred working with Brent because - - unlike Bogart or Cagney - - she didn't have to compete with him . Here , as Davis's jilted fiancé , Brent gives possibly the best performance of his career in a maudlin scene , getting drunk on a park bench . When I saw this scene , I burst out laughing : Brent overplays it ridiculously . . . but this is perhaps the only time in his career when he didn't underplay . A superlative performance is given here by a young African-American actor named Ernest Anderson - - no relation to the much older Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson - - as a black man unfairly arrested for a crime committed by Davis . ( She's perfectly willing to let him take the rap , of course . ) Anderson conveys intelligence and dignity , in an era when most roles for black actors consisted of ' Yassuh ! ' stereotypes . It's a shame that Anderson's career never prospered ; few decent roles were given to black actors in his day . In this film , I was impressed with a scene in an all-negro cellblock , conveying that segregation persists even in prison . Also seen here , all too briefly , is a young black man named Ernest Morrison . . . who , as a boy , had appeared in Hal Roach's silent comedy shorts as " Sunshine Sammy " . Now , about the director . John Huston's father Walter Huston was one of the few character actors who had attained first-rank stardom . To bring good luck to his son's first two films ( ' The Maltese Falcon ' and ' In This Our Life ' ) , Walter Huston played small unbilled roles in both . Here , he plays the bartender in a roadhouse where Davis tarries . The same scene introduces a character played by Lee Patrick . This actress was a Warners contract player at the time , but she's now remembered solely for playing Bogart's secretary in ' The Maltese Falcon ' ( and hilariously parodying that same character decades later , in ' The Black Bird ' . ) Because Walter Huston and Lee Patrick show up in the same scene in this movie , an annoying ( and untrue ) rumour has arisen , claiming that all the major cast members of ' The Maltese Falcon ' make unbilled appearances in ' In This Our Life ' . Bogart , Astor , Lorre , Greenstreet , Elisha Cook , Uncle Tom Cobley and the suicidal Munchkin from ' The Wizard of Oz ' are all ostensibly hiding in this movie someplace . A nice story , but it's just not true . During the roadhouse sequence , bartender Huston keeps trying to have a conversation with some dimly-seen customers in the background while Davis is talking in the foreground . . . but they're all just unidentified extras . They're definitely NOT the ' Falcon ' cast . Adding to the confusion is the presence in this film of John Hamilton as a cop , after playing a D . A . in ' Falcon ' . There are excellent performances all round here ; John Huston's prowess as an actors ' director is under-rated . Even Hattie McDaniel has better material than usual . Max Steiner's scoring falls below his usual high standard , but even the worst Steiner score is better than almost anybody else's best . My rating : . Rest in peace , Ellen Glasgow .
418263	1609079	83721	7.0	Tom's a-cold ; or , dead dad Donovan didn't duly die .	' Carry Me Back ' was a big hit in its native New Zealand , and is a hardy perennial on British television . The U . S . rights were bought by Lorimar , and it's a shame that Stateside distribution has been handled poorly . If Lorimar had put a bit of effort into marketing this movie , they could have had a hit of ' Crocodile Dundee ' proportions . ' Carry Me Back ' is a comedy - - funny , but not hilarious - - with an unusual road-trip story that also offers a splendid visual travelogue of New Zealand , as the main characters ( two living , one dead ) attempt to get home while travelling the length of Kiwi Land . The Donovan brothers - - elder responsible Arthur , younger gormless Jimmy - - work for their widowed father Tom on his remote farm on New Zealand's South Island . It's a sort of ' Steptoe and Sons ' arrangement , with the lads exploited as unpaid labourers by their father while they dream of better things . Their only comfort is the knowledge that they'll inherit the farm when their hard-living elderly father carks it , which ought to be any minute now . SPOILERS COMING . The lads ' favourite rugger team are playing an away on the North Island , and the lads are looking forward to a weekend away from their father and the farm so they can see the match . But their father - - who hasn't set foot off the farm , literally in years - - suddenly decides to tag along . The match goes well ( their team win ) , and the brothers get to chat up a couple of dolly-birds . As they return to their hotel room , their elderly dad goes to bed smiling . He's still smiling the next morning when they find him , stone dead . Now comes the plot contrivance . Tom Donovan's will leaves his farm to his sons , but only providing he's buried on his farm . If this condition is not met , the farm goes to the local council . But , under New Zealand law ( this is a genuine law ; I checked ) , Tom Donovan can only be buried on his land if he died on his land . If he dies elsewhere , he must be interred in a cemetery , or cremated . So , now the lads conspire to make it look as if their dad died at home . But in order to pull it off , they must smuggle their dead dad all the way across New Zealand ( including a trip aboard the public ferry which links the two main islands ) without anyone twigging that he's dead . They nail him in a crate and disguise him as cargo . From here , the movie gets increasingly contrived . The lads enlist the aid of their Auntie Bird : their dead mother's sister , who always despised Tom . It makes little sense for her to help them , but she does . Even more implausibly , Auntie Bird is dating an escaped criminal , who is attempting to get past a police checkpoint by ( wait for it ) shipping himself cross-country disguised in a crate . So , that's two different bodies ( one living , one dead ) hidden in moving crates . Guess what happens . The great merits of ' Carry Me Back ' are the breathtaking views of New Zealand's scenery , and some fine vignettes of the working-class people . The scenes on the Donovan farm are well-photographed . The end of the film is quite suspenseful , as Jimmy tries to sidetrack some unexpected visitors on their father's farm while Arthur makes a last desperate effort to get Tom's corpse home . Most of this movie is only moderately funny , but the climactic gag - - the fake death that Arthur contrives for his father's corpse - - is well and truly hilarious . I'll rate this movie , and it deserves to be better known in America .
419350	1609079	18109	7.0	Nice to look at , but morally obtuse .	Why is this movie titled ' The Love Mart ' ? Would ' The Love MARKET ' have been too shocking ? The opening credits say this movie is based on a novel , but the novel ( which I've not read ) had a different title , so the peculiar title on this movie can't be blamed on the original author . All of the following refers solely to the film version . The story takes place in 19th-century New Orleans before the Civil War . Gilbert Roland is Victor , a wandering swashbuckler who is accustomed to settling all his arguments according to the code duello : he really seems to belong in an 18th-century story rather than the 19th . After getting into a minor argument he is challenged to a duel , which of course he wins handily . ( Victor by name and victor by nature . ) Having won the duel , it turns out that he has also won the challenger's property : a barbershop ! I've never heard of property changing hands as the result of a duel , but I suppose it has happened . The wandering Victor decides to settle down as a barber , at least till a better chance comes along . Now he meets Antoinette , a southern belle played by delicately beautiful Billie Dove . Victor develops a case of the toot-sweets for Antoinette , but she thinks he's a mere barber . ( Maybe she just doesn't fancy a man with a striped pole . ) She turns up her nose and sashays away before you can play ' Shave and a haircut . ' Along comes Captain Remy , played by snarling Noah Beery . Remy offers himself to Antoinette , but she ain't having any . So the captain forges evidence to indicate that blue-blood Antoinette is secretly a quadroon . . . meaning that she's one part Negro . ( Which part ? ) By the laws of the time , Antoinette is legally black . . . and so she can be sold at slave auction to the highest bidder . Next thing she knows , Antoinette is chained , docketed as merchandise , and paraded before the lewdly-grinning slave-buyers , a slavering bunch of slavers . Yesterday she was a proud aristocrat ; now she's a piece of flesh for sale . SPOILERS COMING . It's no surprise at all that Victor rescues Antoinette , nor is it any surprise that he forces Remy to reveal the forgery . . . thus safely restoring Antoinette to the privileged status of full ( white ) citizenship . What deeply offended me about this movie was its selective indignation towards slavery . As Billie Dove languishes in chains before the auction block , the mise-en-scene of the climactic sequences strongly emphasises the injustice of Antoinette's plight . . . but it's only depicted as injustice because she's a white woman who has been framed as a quadroon . Nobody involved in this movie ( on either side of the camera ) seems especially upset about the institution of slavery . . . providing it's only those pesky BLACK people who get bought and sold . Beery is note-perfect in a crudely-written role , and there are good performances by Armand Kaliz , a surprisingly handsome Boris Karloff ( as a dandified villain in a beaver hat ) and a rotund George Bunny . The production design of this costume drama is excellent , and George Fitzmaurice's direction is brisk and efficient . I really wanted to enjoy ' The Love Mart ' , but its selectively outraged attitude towards slavery is deeply upsetting from a modern viewpoint . I'll rate this movie .
418874	1609079	351663	7.0	Duel suspension of disbelief .	I saw the short Danish film ' Rivalinder ' ( ' Rivals ' ) in October 2006 - - a century after its original release - - at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . . . but the print which was screened was an acetate dupe restored in 1999 from a print in a German film archive , with German intertitles . Consequently , I can only address the film's action as described in this German version , not the Danish original . One of the hazards of viewing ( or reviewing ) silent films is that the print at hand may vary considerably from the original release , due to rewritten ( or translated ) screen titles and / or re-ordering of the footage . There are no credits in this print , which may be down to its being a foreign print ( a Danish film exhibited in German cinemas ) or because at this time ( 1906 ) credits were not an established custom . The film's director / scenarist is believed to be Viggo Larsen , but this is purely an assumption based on the fact that he was the most prolific Danish filmmaker at the time . The actors seen here have not been identified from roles in other films . SPOILERS AHEAD . Here's the plot , such as it is . A curtain-twitcher sees a married man trysting with his mistress ; the busybody rushes to the wife and grasses him . With the busybody as her second , the wife challenges the mistress to a duel ! The husband receives a letter from his wife - - footage inserted here of handwriting in German , replacing the Danish original - - informing him that the duel is about to take place . Pistols at ten paces ! The frantic husband arrives at the duelling ground , just too late : his mistress has just killed his wife . As he's now a widower , this leaves him free to marry his mistress , ja ? Nein ! He spurns her , so she shoots him dead and then kills herself . How many bullets are in that pistol ? This plot is well and truly implausible . I can just barely believe that two European women of this time might fight a duel over a man , but would they really do so with pistols ? The film's brevity leaves various points unclear ; the actors ' costumes don't look quite right for contemporary clothing , and it's possible that this story actually takes place in the mid-19th century . ( I wish that the print I'd viewed had contained the original Danish titles . ) Also , I got the impression that the wife - - the challenger in this duel - - is the one who chose pistols as the weapons to be used ; if so , this violates the code duello . It's quite possible that the filmmakers weren't striving for plausibility , and simply wanted to give their audiences a fast-moving story with action and violence . On that point , they certainly succeeded . Normally , I don't rate a movie if it's incomplete or if some factor prevents me from attaining full comprehension of the filmmakers ' intentions ; in this case , because the film is so short and I want it to become better known , I'll rate ' Rivalinder ' .
419256	1609079	24570	7.0	A pair of Jacks are busted	Jack Oakie was a very funny comedian within his narrow range . He usually played a blowhard of slightly below-average intelligence , with a high opinion of his own prowess but who lacked the ability to deliver the goods . ( It's a shame that Oakie never got a crack at the role he was born to play : Aubrey Piper in George Kelly's ' The Show-Off ' . ) For some reason , Oakie was cast several times as a songwriter : in ' June Moon ' , ' Tin Pan Alley ' and here in ' Sitting Pretty ' , a semi-musical . Jack Oakie ( music ) and Jack Haley ( lyrics ) play a would-be songwriting team ; Haley has no illusions about his own talent , but he thinks Oakie's a genius . . . and Oakie agrees . Why is it that movies about songwriters always make a bigger deal of the composer than the lyricist ? Anyway , the magnum opus of this pair of Jacks is a pity of a ditty called ' I Wanna Meander with Miranda ' , which gives you some idea of their career aspirations . These guys live in New York City , which in 1933 was probably the best place for songwriters to live . They stupidly decide they'd have a better chance of selling their songs if they moved to Hollywood . Lacking the dough to buy tickets on the Super Chief , they decide to hitch-hike all the way to La-La Land . Alleged hilarity ensues . Along the way , they pick up vivacious young Ginger Rogers , who can sing and dance a treat . See where this is heading ? SPOILERS COMING . Part of the problem with ' Sitting Pretty ' is that the songs written by the two Jacks - meaning , of course , the songs written by Paramount's music department , and attributed to these fictional characters - are intentionally bad , but never quite reach the level of camp humour . Then , when the two Jacks write a genuinely impressive song - ' Did You Ever See a Dream Walking ? ' - we have difficulty believing that these no-hopers could ever achieve such a masterpiece . Ginger Rogers is a knockout in a sequined outfit , while Arthur Jarrett ( who ? ) warbles in falsetto . Jack Haley is in the best singing voice of his career here , although he has some trouble with lyrics . . . made worse because he's playing the man who allegedly wrote them . He sings one song quite well but can't seem to remember whether it's about Lazy Lowdown Liza or Lowdown Lazy Liza . Oakie does a very convincing job of faking his piano-playing . There's some humour along the way to the ( obvious ) payoff , but most of it is predictable or contrived or both . Lew Cody is very good as a drunken Hollywood director , and Thelma Todd is briefly impressive as a conniving actress . The final gag ( in which Ginger explains why she can't marry Haley ) is weak . I'll rate this movie just .
419476	1609079	249925	7.0	Oh , bee-hive yourself !	I saw ' Marvellous Beehive ' in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone ; the annual festival has made a welcome return to that town after eight years in nearby Sacile . . . a town no less beautiful , but in Sacile the festival's programme was split between two smaller cinemas at opposite ends of the town , thus forcing me ( and other attendees ) to hustle back and forth from one screening to another . The festival screened a beautiful stencil-coloured print of this French film , on loan from the National Film and Sound Archive in Australia . The delicate colours definitely added to the viewing pleasure of the festival's audience . An establishing shot of a beehive , with a few bees on patrol , magically dissolves into a corps de ballet of dancing girls in bee costumes , with the prima danseuse as their queen bee . They perform before a painted backdrop resembling a grotto . When the queen bee falls asleep , she is attacked by an enormous spider . But her loyal soldier bees rescue her , and all ends with more dancing . This movie would have been far less effective in monochrome , as the delicate colours heighten the tone of artifice and fantasy . This gentle fairytale is short enough not to wear out its welcome , and ' Marvellous Beehive ' would make a great ' extra ' for a DVD version of Jerry Seinfeld's ' Bee Movie ' . ( Were you expecting ' The Sting ' ? ) I hope my favourable review will create some buzz ( sorry ! ) for this film , which is a real honey . ( Ouch ! ) My rating : .
418776	1609079	870	7.0	Rigoletto , the Libretto ; or , Hugo First .	I saw this film in October 1998 at the Cinema Muto festival in Pordenone , Italy . They screened a print from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City . The print ran 16 minutes at 16fps ( I timed it ) , but was missing its original intertitles , so the original running time would have been at least two minutes longer . This is of course the Victor Hugo story that provided the basis for Verdi's opera " Rigoletto " . IMDb's synopsis for ' A Fool's Revenge ' seems to be based on the Verdi opera , not on this short film itself . Necessarily , this brief silent movie omits all the music and most of the plot from Verdi's opera , but there are other differences less mandatory , which director D . W . Griffith ( or his producer ) seems to have chosen out of concern for the sensitivities of his American audience . I'll cite just a handful of the differences here : In Hugo's original play and Verdi's opera , the Duke sends his henchmen to abduct the Countess so that he can seduce her , but they accidentally abduct Gilda ( the jester's daughter ) instead . The Duke therefore seduces Gilda . In Griffith's film , the Duke intentionally tasks his men to abduct Gilda so that ( get this , please ) she can cure his melancholy ! When she arrives , he merely gazes upon her beauty ( so that's all he wanted , then ) and then he releases her . There are other divergences , but that should give you the general idea . Somebody at Mutoscope ( Griffith himself ? ) clearly intended to bowdlerise this story , quite apart from condensing it into such a short running time . Grand opera was popular in American cities in the 1900s , so I can't help wondering why Griffith gave this film a generic title rather than calling it ' Rigoletto ' : the film isn't even " A Court Jester's Revenge " , mind you , but " A Fool's Revenge " , which sounds as if this is going to be a modern-day slapstick comedy about an idiot , instead of a mediaeval European melodrama . Opera has always been less popular in the rural U . S . than in metropolitan areas , and perhaps Griffith was more concerned with the sensibilities of his fellow rural Southerners than with more sophisticated " Yankees " . I was intrigued to spot the comically moon-faced Fred Mace among Griffith's troupe here , as one of the courtiers . My rating for this movie is .
418238	1609079	217151	7.0	Rare D . H . Lawrence drama	D . H . Lawrence is of course best known for his novels , but he also wrote several plays , of which ' The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd ' is probably the best constructed . I dislike Lawrence's novels while recognising his skill in writing them , and I felt somewhat similar about this play : I disliked it , yet recognised it as a mature work by a talented author . The play is set in a dreary mining town , and the action is centred on the deteriorating marriage between a loutish miner ( Rex Robbins ) and his more refined wife ( Joyce Ebert ) . Holroyd is a drunkard who abuses his wife physically and emotionally , even bringing home younger women to flaunt his infidelities in front of his long-suffering spouse . In spite of everything , Mrs Holroyd still loves her husband . Among Holroyd's workmates is Blackmore , a more sensitive man . In love with Mrs Holroyd himself , he offers to take her and her two young children away with him to Spain . Frank Converse is fitfully excellent in this role . His performance reaches an emotional peak during Blackmore's frustrated liaison with Mrs Holroyd , telling her : " Why should he have you and I've never had anything ? " The best performance here is given by Rex Robbins . He has consistently impressed me in other roles . but this was the first time I've seen him portray an unsympathetic character . As played by Robbins , Holroyd is singularly repellent . Robbins reminds me of Arthur Kennedy : both were dynamic actors with wide ranges , yet both somehow lacked that certain spark that is necessary for stardom . The drama's title is a built-in spoiler : we suspect ( correctly ) that Holroyd will be dead before the final fade-out . During the climactic fight between the two men , Blackmore knocks the drunken Holroyd unconscious and then - - ever the gentleman - - wipes the blood off Holroyd's face . One of the most moving scenes occurs when Mrs Holroyd and her mother-in - law wash Holroyd's corpse . I found this drama repellent yet powerful , and this production is skilfully done . My rating : .
418801	1609079	11958	7.0	Early McGuffin , sexy maid .	In some of Larry Semon's comedies , he seemed to be positioning himself as a somewhat Chaplinesque little man , to the extent of making his character the subordinate of a large bully resembling Eric Campbell , the burly and memorable foil in Chaplin's short comedies for Mutual . In these Eric Campbell roles , Larry Semon cast Oliver Hardy with a bushy pair of eyebrows and a moustache resembling the ones Campbell wore in ' The Adventurer ' . Hardy sprouts that face-fungus here , as he does in a few other Semon films , including ' The Bakery ' . Does everybody here know what a McGuffin is ? In the movies , a McGuffin ( term popularised but not invented by Alfred Hitchcock ) is some prop or device which we don't give a damn about , but which is so important to the characters that they're willing to spend the whole movie trying to obtain it from one another . The concept existed in films long before Hitchcock put a name to it : in fact , silent-serial queen Pearl White used the term ' the weenie ' to describe whatever physical object or piece of information triggered the cloak-and-dagger work in her own serials . Well , here in ' The Bell Hop ' , we have an early appearance of the McGuffin in all but name . A foreign dignitary has checked into the hotel where Semon is bell-hop and Oliver Hardy is desk clerk . The dignitary has some extremely important papers - - the McGuffin - - which are duly locked in the hotel's safe . But enemy spies bribe Hardy to give them access to the papers . Some very jaded intertitles make blasé comments about ' the usual spies ' and ' the usual papers ' , thus establishing that McGuffins were already well-established ( although not by name ) as early as 1921 . For me , the most pleasant aspect of ' The Bell Hop ' was a sprightly performance by Norma Nichols as a hotel maid , extremely sexy in a maid's uniform which should have had a shorter skirt . She very quickly reveals herself to Semon and the audience ( no spoilers here ) as an undercover detective , and she offers to split with Semon the reward for capturing the spies . But surely a professional law-enforcement officer ( as Nichols is playing here ) can't claim a reward . PARTIAL SPOILERS . An unbilled child actor gives an interesting performance as a golden-haired little girl , although I think that the child performer is actually a boy in a girl's role ( and clothes ) . There's an unfunny gag with a pram and a tram . Semon and Nichols put the girl into her pram , and wheel her outside where the pram's wheels get caught on the rails for the tram line . And here comes the tram ! So far , so potentially effective . . . except that we can see the tram line's angled tracks at the bottom of the frame . . . so we know that the tram will make a sharp turn at the last possible moment and veer hard a-port . Sure enough . Semon's character is introduced with an unfunny and disgusting gag in which a live newt runs across his face while Semon has his mouth open . Ugh ! Semon - - a comedian who almost never did female impersonation - - is much more impressive here in a later sequence in which he disguises himself as a charlady to get into the spies ' room . Shall I do you now , sir ? The production design of this film is extremely impressive , featuring a luxury hotel with a lobby so large and populous that a traffic cop has to direct the flow of people . I was also very impressed with another sequence featuring an unusual cinematic effect . When Semon spills water on a sleeping man , we see the inset image of a thought balloon over the man's head , showing him having a dream in which he's bathing in the ocean , while the actor playing the sleeping man makes swimming movements . Very effective AND funny ! I'll rate ' The Bell Hop ' , which is surely as high as any Larry Semon comedy can aspire to rise .
418839	1609079	3288	7.0	Lon Chaney pays his dues	I saw " Poor Jake's Demise " ( another allegedly ' lost ' film ) this week at the 2006 Giornate del Cinema Muto in Sacile , Italy . A print of this movie turned up in England in May 2006 ; its opening titles were gone , and someone had spliced on the opening title of a Charley Bowers one-reeler . ( Bowers was a comedian whose heyday - - such as it was - - came circa 1927 . ) At Cinema Muto , " Poor Jake's Demise " was screened with no opening title , but with its original intertitles . Several reference sources have cited " Poor Jake's Demise " as Lon Chaney's screen debut . Actually , it is the earliest known film for which Chaney received billing in trade publications : very likely , he had already performed perceptible roles in at least a dozen previous films , apart from movies in which he was one more extra in crowd scenes . When I first heard of this film , I assumed that it was related to the popular " Poor Jake " series of comic strips written and drawn by George Herriman circa this period , about an overworked farmhand . The name turns out to be coincidence . This movie is a crude slapstick comedy , produced by IMP - - Independent Motion Pictures - - one of the poverty-row concerns that eventually coalesced into Universal Studios . Chaney doesn't play the title role here : that dubious honour goes to Max Asher , a ' Dutch ' vaudeville comic with a Prussian moustache . Chaney plays a spiffy character who is apparently meant to be a lady-killer , but he endows this role with lots of the effeminate fussy movements which audiences of this period would have associated with the stock vaudeville character known as a ' nance ' . This movie is a clear rip-off of the Keystone formula , already established at this early date . We see a fairly normal-looking desk officer , but the three cops on the beat ( a big fat guy , a shrimp and a beanpole ) look like rejects from the Keystone Cops Academy . There are plenty of pratfalls here . I was surprised to see two separate gags involving the rude gesture of thumb to nose , which was considered extremely vulgar in 1913 America : at least as vulgar as the ' badfinger ' gesture today . Before entering films , Chaney had been a dancer and choreographer on the western theatre circuit , and he puts that training to good use here . His performance is extremely physical . He dives out a window , does a forward roll and comes up in a somersault . He executes a straight-back pratfall that would do credit to David Jason's " Del Boy " Trotter . When Chaney sashays his way up the porch stairs , he almost seems to break into a dance . At one point , he takes a siphon of soda-water in the face . Also seen to advantage here is Louise Fazenda , looking about the same as she would look at Keystone a bit later . Fazenda later married producer Hal Wallis and took a well-earned retirement . More for its historic value than for any actual merits , I'll rate " Poor Jake's Demise " . Good luck with that career , Lon !
418699	1609079	148673	7.0	Chapeaux on the magpies .	I never thought I'd spot an example of Walt Disney following Paul Terry's lead , but here we have a Terrytoon that anticipates a Disney toon . ' Rival Romeos ' features Heckle and Jeckle in almost exactly the same premise that would show up a year later in the 1951 Disney epic ' Two Chips and a Miss ' featuring Chip ' n ' Dale competing for the favours of a female chipmunk . Here we have the two magpies vying for the affections of a female bird : one of the very rare examples of a genuine female character ( rather than a female impersonation ) in a Heckle and Jeckle toon . Although this she-toon is clearly a bird , she's also some avian species radically different from the two magpies ( is she a chicken ? I can't tell ) , so what they're seeking here is some interspecies lovin ' . Also , the female bird is drawn with a teeny-tiny little beak that's just barely visible . Of all the U . S . - based animation studios , Terrytoons routinely had the worst in-betweeners : the characters in Paul Terry's cartoons have a tendency to shimmy distressingly from one frame to the next . In ' Rival Romeos ' , this doesn't happen . . . but the female bird is so crudely animated that she seems to move like a male character rather than a female . This may be down to what I previously observed : the rarity of female characters in Heckle and Jeckle cartoons . Director Eddie Donnelly should have studied the Red Hot Riding Hood cartoons directed by Tex Avery , in order to learn how to animate a female character convincingly without rotoscoping . ( Not likely Paul Terry would spend the money to buy a rotoscope ! ) As the IMDb reviewer Robert Reynolds has already commented , this cartoon clearly establishes that Heckle is the magpie with the prole New York accent , whilst Jeckle is the one with the cod English accent . But I knew that already . What I found more surprising about ' Rival Romeos ' is that in this toon the two magpies live in separate but adjacent quarters ; several other cartoons in their series establish them as room-mates . By the way , I hope someone can tell me the name for the distinctly American style of hat which Heckle wears in this cartoon . It's the same hat style worn by Mister Magoo's nephew Waldo ; I've only ever seen it in photos ( and movies ) of American men from circa 1920 to 1950 : usually college students , for some reason . It certainly never caught on in Britain nor Australia . ( It resembles a porkpie hat , but it's very different from Buster Keaton's familiar porkpie . ) Meanwhile , Jeckle sports a monocle here : I suppose this is meant to ' prove ' that he really is from England . ' Romeo Rivals ' ends with a gag that's rather obvious but still amusing , featuring a parody of the iris-out device . My rating for this one : , and one of those points is for this toon's historic value in establishing which magpie is which . This cartoon is definitely funnier ( with a better ending ) than ' Two Chips and a Miss ' .
418690	1609079	249713	7.0	Better than I'd expected .	The German title ' Liebesleute ' would translate imprecisely as ' Love-Folk ' or ' The Ones Who Love ' . Here we have a story which , at first glance , would seem to be one of the oldest and most trite of moss-covered Mills & Boon chestnuts : the one about the peasant girl who marries the handsome young nobleman , and they live happily ever after on their love and his wealth . Fortunately , upon second glance , it turns out that this movie's story is a bit more original : the handsome young nobleman is skint , and their love isn't enough to live on without a pfew pfennigs . To the extent that ' Liebesleute ' IS a hoary old story , at least it comes with an impressive pedigree : the opening credits of this German film claim that it's inspired by ' Hermann und Dorothea ' , the epic poem by Johann von Goethe . Actually , this movie resembles that poem only to about the extent that ' West Side Story ' resembles ' Romeo and Juliet ' . Dorothea Rainer ( Renate Müller ) is an attractive young German : orphaned in childhood , she was sent to Canada with a colony of German farmers . ( I wonder if they're any relation to the group headed by Anton Walbrook in ' 49th Parallel ' . ) But the agricultural colony failed due to drought , and now Dorothea is home in Germany . . . although ' home ' is meaningless , since she has no family and no property . By chance , she passes near the ancestral lands of Baron von Goren ( Heinrich Schroth ) . The baron has a handsome young son , Hermann ( Gustav Fröhlich ) . Herman and Dorothea ' meet cute ' , and it's love at first umlaut . Happy ending ? Nicht ! Nein ! Nix ! The baron , as it happens , also has a mountain of debts . A local businessman ( Harry Liedtke ) holds the note on the baronial estate , but he will cancel the debt if his daughter Helga ( Gina Falckenberg ) marries Hermann , thus bringing a title into the family . The baron is in favour of this . But Hermann and Dorothea , having tasted true love , have their own ideas . They go off to the city , penniless but determined to make their own way . Eventually and bitterly , they discover that they can't live on love alone . They need a few groschen to buy groscheries . . . My all-time favourite film is ' Metropolis ' , in which Gustav Fröhlich gave a strong performance as the juvenile lead . . . but I doubt that Fröhlich's performance is the reason why anybody sees that great film . In the early sound era , Fröhlich made an impressive transition to the disciplines of emoting for talkies . In his later years , he was a sort of grey eminence for young actors in Austria and Switzerland . Here , he gives a solid performance in a role that could have been very bland . Quite a few German movies from this period ( the early days of the Third Reich ) are sheer candyfloss , offering escapist entertainment rather than realistic drama . ' Liebesleute ' starts out that way , boding to be one more Cinderella story . But I was deeply impressed by the stark realism of the later scenes , as the two young lovers try to make a go of it on their own terms , only to discover that it won't be easy . The ending is somewhat contrived but still plausible , and all ends happily . I'll rate this interesting drama .
418620	1609079	9857	7.0	Korda and Corda in moody intrigue .	I actively seek out movies from as many different nations ( and languages ) and time periods as possible : one reason being so that I can experience at least a few details of many different cultures ( and eras , at least since the days of early cinema ) . Also , if the films aren't in English , I endeavour to learn some of the native language ( or improve my existing ability ) by gleaning as much information as I can get from the actors ' spoken dialogue or the printed subtitles or ( as in the case of this silent film ) title cards in that language . ' A 111-es ' ( meaning ' In 111 ' , referring to a room number in an hotel in this movie ) is an Hungarian silent film . I viewed a print with the original intertitles in Magyar . My grasp of that language is very limited , so I was keen to improve my knowledge here . For that purpose , ' A 111-es ' proved to be a bad choice , since it's a melodrama with some degree of mystery about it , and much of the action is intentionally baffling even if you speak the lingo . However , I was also attracted to this film by the fact that it was directed by ( the future Sir ) Alexander Korda , who later had an impressive film career in Britain . Among my friends is an Hungarian expatriate who kindly sits through some ( often very boring ) Hungarian movies with me , selectively translating at my request and explaining obscure references . She wasn't available for this screening , so I had to muddle through on my tod with my very limited knowledge of Magyar . If I make a few errors here , I hope someone more familiar with this movie will contact me with corrections . An evil baron with a jawbreaker name ( well-played by Jenö Törzs ) carried on a torrid affair with innocent young Olga , but spitefully cast her off . She dies soon afterward , having lost the will to live . She does , however , possess a lookalike sister Vera . From upstage left enters Sidney , an English conjuror who enlists Vera in his magic act as a ploy to get revenge on the baron for killing her sister . Sidney uses various stage illusions and some unconvincing hypnotism to nobble the baron , and of course it's bang obvious that Vera will impersonate Olga . But things take an unexpected turn when Vera - - impersonating her sister - - spoils the plan by becoming attracted to the baron , just as her sister was . Or is something else happening ? I had difficulty following much of the action , partly down to my poor grasp of the language but also largely down to this movie's intentionally baffling narrative and spooky atmosphere , which is well sustained . In the dual roles of the lookalike sisters , María Corda ( any relation to Korda ? ) is quite pretty and a talented actress who actually makes her two roles seem genuinely like two different people : a feat made even more impressive since one of them spends much of this movie impersonating the other . Despite this movie's intentional confusions , there's never any doubt ( for the audience , not for the other characters ) as to which sister is which , since they never both appear in the same sequence - - much less in the same camera set-up - - and so there's no need for trick photography . I did find the lead actress's name distracting , though . In Britain , there's a famous murder case in which a simple young rural woman from East Anglia named Maria Marten was led astray and then murdered by a man named William Corder who had promised to marry her . In ' A 111-es ' , María Corda plays a simple young rural woman who's led astray by a man on the make , with fatal results . The two tragedies ( one real , one fictional ) aren't neat parallels , but they're just similar enough that I kept thinking of the name María Corda as " Maria Corder " ( the Maria from East Anglia had hoped to marry Corder ) , and this distracted me at several key points while watching this film . I was intrigued to learn that Jenö Törzs , who gives an excellent performance here as the nefarious baron , later starred in a sound remake of this film as the English magician . I wonder if he preferred that role , which ( in the silent version , at least ) is certainly more sympathetic . In this silent version , Gyula Bartos's performances of the conjuror's tricks are not very impressive , and the hypnotism sequences here are as ludicrous as the ones in ' Mark of the Vampire ' . I admit that I didn't understand ' A 111-es ' very well , but Alexander Korda shows skill and imagination at this early point in his directing career , and much of this movie impressed me . I'll rate it .
418395	1609079	48996	7.0	Terrific Tom Tully , but Sylvia stinks	Tom Tully is one of the best examples - possibly the best example - of a Hollywood character actor who played prominent supporting roles in many films yet who remains unknown to audiences ( even movie-trivia buffs ) because he consistently gave understated and subtle performances , refusing to throw a film's storyline off-centre by calling attention to himself . In ' Behind the High Wall ' , Tully gets a rare chance in a leading role , and he proves himself an actor of great talent and range . Unfortunately , his leading lady here is one of my least favourite actresses : Sylvia Sidney ( snaggled of tooth , bulbous of lips , coarse of accent ) . Tully plays Frank Carmichael , a prison governor with money problems and a crippled wife ( Sidney , not crippled enough to suit me ) . Some inmates , who have accomplices and money waiting for them on the out , organise an escape . . . killing a cellblock warder in the process . They take along two hostages : Carmichael and Hutchins , an inmate who wants to go straight . Once they're on the out , the escapees join up with accomplices who have $100 , 000 in hot swag . A convenient road accident kills everyone except Carmichael and Hutchins . As the loot can't be traced to Carmichael , he decides to keep it , pinning the warder's murder on Hutchins to get him out of the way . But then of course there are complications . . . Sylvia Sidney's role here is too similar to her role in ' Fury ' , a much better movie than this one . In both films , she forces the protagonist to stay honest when I wanted him to benefit from a circumstance of chance that worked illegally in his favour . I have a lot of problems with Sylvia Sidney : I've never liked her in any performance of hers I've ever seen . Yet my all-time favourite director ( Fritz Lang ) cast her in the lead roles in his first three American films , so he must have seen some merit in her . Damned if I can find it , though . Shortly after Sylvia Sidney's death , a tribute for her was held at the Players Club in Gramercy Park , New York City ( she had lived there on the club's charity , with her yapping little pug dogs ) . I covered this event as a reporter . One after another , dozens of celebrities related anecdotes about Sidney , but each of those stories boiled down to one of three punchlines : Sylvia wanted some booze , Sylvia said a dirty word , or Sylvia was rude to somebody who didn't deserve it . If you changed the booze to drugs , any of those stories could have been told about John Belushi . The difference was , all the blue-haired dowagers in the Players Club - who laughed merrily at these stories of Sylvia Sidney boozing , cursing and insulting people - would have been profoundly offended by these exact same stories if they had been attributed to John Belushi . In the key role as Carmichael's fall guy , John Gavin gives a good performance but is miscast . Gavin is so superhumanly handsome , he isn't believable as a small-time criminal . There are fine performances here ( in small roles ) by Don Beddoe , Ed Kemmer , John Larch , Peter Leeds and satchel-mouthed Barney Phillips . Tom Tully is a revelation , and deserves to be better known . I was annoyed that all the actors kept using the American pronunciation of the name ' Carmichael ' , with the accent on the wrong syllable , but that's to be expected in a Yank movie . I'll rate ' Behind the High Wall ' . I might have rated it higher if Sylvia Sidney's lips didn't enter the room five seconds ahead of the rest of her body .
418358	1609079	1732	7.0	She guides her boyfriend's dinghy into a snug harbour .	I saw ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' at the Pordenone silent-film festival in Sacile , Italy , in 2006 . The print that was screened for us had a surprise bonus : at some point in its history ( presumably during its original release , while William Howard Taft was President of the U . S . A . ) the starting leader had broken off the print , and some projectionist had replaced it by splicing in several feet of newsreel footage showing President Taft . The programmers at the Pordenone festival decided to keep this in , and I'm glad they did . I well and truly had a sense of watching this film as it was exhibited in 1911 . . . in the rough and ready days when , if a film broke , you did whatever was necessary to keep the show going ! ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' is a shortened version of James Herne's 1893 stage melodrama ' Shore Acres ' , radically abridged and revised as a star vehicle for Mary Pickford . ' Shore Acres ' was hugely popular in its day , and controversial with it . . . largely due to the fact that one character was ( gasp ! ) an atheist who spoke the earth-shaking ( in those days ) line " He said he'd see me in Hell first . " ( That line and the character who spoke it are absent from this version . ) Herne's play was a perennial favourite for about 20 years , but is now painfully dated . ( Buster Keaton and his father were lampooning ' Shore Acres ' in their vaudeville turn , circa 1905 . ) Several of the scenes in this melodrama do not work well on stage , notably the climax in a fishing boat in a storm at sea during a dark night : this film version benefits from being able to open up such scenes . Pickford plays Polly Berry , daughter of the old lighthouse keeper Nat Berry ( J . Farrell MacDonald , excellent as always ) . Two local youths , noble Tom Atkins ( John Harvey ) and rakehell Bert Duncan ( William E . Shay ) , are rivals for Polly's affection . When Tom earns her favour , Bert darkly vows revenge and then skulks off into the canebrakes . Later , Polly and Tom are incautious enough to be in a fishing boat at sea while a storm brews . Their only hope of safely reaching shore depends on the lighthouse's faithful beacon . Bert , in a drunken rage , climbs into the lighthouse and tries to put out the light . He and Nat Berry scuffle . ( Although this scene is heavily rewritten , it retains the climactic fistfight from the original play . ) SPOILERS COMING NOW . Although much older and less fit than the drunken Bert , cold sober Nat Berry manages to defeat him and keep the lamp lighted . Bert wanders off into the surf . Come morning , the storm has passed : Polly and Tom are safely home , while Bert's bloated corpse washes up on the rocks . By far the best thing in this creaky mellerdrammer is Mary Pickford's performance . Age 19 at the time , she is ( for once ) exactly the right age for the role she is playing . There is just a hint of Pickford's " Little Mary " in her portrayal of a young woman who is sexually mature yet emotionally innocent , with a touch of Grace Darling at the film's climax . Character actor J . Farrell MacDonald had a long film career , yet is now completely forgotten except by die-hard film fans : his stalwart performance is likewise an asset to this film , which otherwise tips over dangerously into the laughable territory of morality plays . As for the performances of the actors playing the rivals Tom and Bert . . . well , there's a reason why they languish in obscurity . More happily , there's a wedding scene in which I briefly spotted actor Hayward Mack and Mary's sister Lottie Pickford . IMDb's web page for ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' says that this film was shown aboard the Titanic , three nights before the fateful Night to Remember . I've never heard this rumour from any other source , and I've no idea whether or not it's true . If so , it's deeply ironic , as the climax of ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' depicts two people struggling to survive in a small craft at sea on a dark night . No icebergs , though . . . nor even iceberg lettuce . I'll rate ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' .
419299	1609079	24679	7.0	Did the Joker follow the Ace of Spades ?	SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' is one of those wildly implausible movies from Hollywood's studio era which still manage to be hugely enjoyable on the strength of sheer audacity and some colourful performances . Here we have that old chestnut : the serial murderer who announces his crimes in advance , in a highly theatrical manner , yet repeatedly kills his victims without getting caught . We also have that even mouldier chestnut : the amateur sleuth who is able to outwit the cops and nab the baddie . In this case , the murderer proclaims his intentions in advance by delivering to each victim an ace of spades ( the death card ) , with a neatly-written message announcing the hour at which he intends to do the deed . Naturally , he consistently manages to kill his victims ( and get away clean , his identity a secret ) even though they've been well and fairly warned . As the killer neglects to leave his name in the guest-book , he is cried the Ace of Spades . He murders wealthy art dealer Asa Marsden , and here we get another old-movie cliché : the murder shown from the killer's viewpoint . We see the victim goggling into the camera as the killer carks him , but the murderer is unseen . Next , the Ace of Spades announces his intention to murder wealthy Thornton Drake ' tomorrow at seven ' . ( Presumably this is P . M . , not A . M . . . . surely even serial murderers shouldn't have to get up early . ) At the fatal hour , the deed is done aboard an aeroplane in flight . At the stroke of seven , the lights go out in the passenger cabin . . . then they switch on again , and there's a corpse on the deckplates , stabbed through the heart . But the dead man isn't Drake : it's his secretary Austin Winters . Afterwards , the pilot claims to know nothing . The official detectives in this movie are played by two of my favourite character actors : Frank McHugh and the superb Allen Jenkins . Here they play characters named Clancy and Dugan , which gives you some idea of what to expect . Unfortunately , both actors perform their sleuth roles as comedy relief , which I found regrettable : the murders in this movie are played straight , so the seriousness of the homicides is undercut by the intentional comedy of the detectives trying to catch the killer . Screenwriter Ralph Spence often combined straightforward chills and broad comedy in his scripts - - notably in his play ' The Gorilla ' - - but here the mixture isn't as smooth as usual . The hero of this film is played by Chester Morris , so it's obvious who will solve the crime . For some reason , a lot of Hollywood whodunnits of the 1930s and ' 40s featured amateur detectives . Here , Morris plays a mystery novelist ( oh , boy ) who is researching the criminal career of the Ace of Spades as material for his next book . Morris decides that it might make a nice finish for his book if he actually catches the murderer . Along with this film's other merits , there's the Batman factor . It's well known that Batman's greatest villain the Joker ( created in 1939 ) was inspired by the character played by Conrad Veidt in ' The Man Who Laughs ' . But the premise of ' Tomorrow at Seven ' strongly resembles the premise of the Joker's debut story , and this 1933 movie may have supplied some inspiration to Batman's scriptwriter Bill Finger . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' has a lot of the little touches that make 1930s B-movies so enjoyable . Unfortunately , this movie also has a couple of the little touches so typical of that time which are very much less enjoyable . Here , we get a mercifully brief turn by African-American actor Gus Robinson in a ' yassuh ! ' role . I don't blame Robinson , whose options as a black actor in 1930s Hollywood must have been limited . I'll rate this otherwise enjoyable movie .
419452	1609079	270001	7.0	Too many Ladislauses ; or , are you being Serbed ?	The movie's title translates as ' Ulrich of Celje and Ladislaus Hunyadi ' . This 13-minute Serbian film was acclaimed as one of the real finds at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy , where I saw it . The festival screened a beautiful new 35mm sepia print made via the Desmet method , copied from the original nitrate positive and nitrate negative , both of which have miraculously survived in the Reinthaler Collection at Filmarchiv Austria . The excellent photography was credited to one Louis De Beery , a mystery man of the silent-film era . It has only recently ( as I write this ) been learnt that De Beery was actually Lajos Zoltan Arpad Pitrof , a Hungarian who apparently felt that success would come more easily if he were a Frenchman . The uncredited script ( believed to be by ' De Beery ' ) is based on an 1839 stage play and an 1844 opera adaptated from that play , both titled ' Hunyadi Ladislaus ' . All three dramatisations are based on a true incident in Serbian history . I'm not familiar with the original incident ; this film review is based solely on the film , which I'm assuming is historically accurate . In November 1456 , numerous intrigues and pretenders threaten the royal succession in the kingdom of Hungary . Count Ulrich of Celje is the uncle , guardian and regent of young King Ladislaus V . This film details the uprisings of another Ladislaus - - Hunyadi - - whose insurgents storm the Belgrade fortress , murder Count Ulrich , and seize control of the city . Hunyadi's forces are then overthrown by loyalist royalists , leading to the execution of Hunyadi . Even though it has room for one Ladislaus too many , this film is so brief that it necessarily consists of tableaux rather than a flowing narrative . The actors show absolutely no experience in the techniques of film acting , and confine themselves largely to striking poses and pulling faces . Evidently this particular incident in history is deeply significant to the people of Hungary , and I've no doubt that audiences in 1911 applauded this very simple and simplistic staging of a story they already knew well . The programme notes at Sacile revealed an interesting fact about this movie which I would not have known on my tod : this brief and by-the-numbers epic was the first film ever made in Serbia ( explaning why the actors have no film experience ) . However , a few days after this production was wrapped , the same production unit made a larger and more ambitious historic epic , ' The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Duke Karadjordja ' . Recognising that this second film was the better of the two , they chose to release it first . Accordingly , ' Duke Karadjordja ' has been ( inaccurately ) acclaimed in Serbia and neighbouring nations as the very first Serbian film , when in fact ' Ulrich of Celje ' precedes it . Ah , well . The makers of this film deserve high marks for effort , with somewhat lower marks for execution . If I make allowances for the fact that this movie was made way back in 1911 , I must also bear in mind that far more elaborate and ambitious ( and better ) movies were being made in other nations at that date . However , those production companies in other nations had access to bigger production budgets . Split the difference , and I'll rate this interesting historical footnote .
418800	1609079	36919	8.0	Pretty maids all in a row ? Well , Grace and Marcy , at least .	In Frank Sinatra's first three films , he was purely a speciality act : ostensibly playing himself , he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie . In his fourth film , the very enjoyable ' Higher and Higher ' , Young Blue Eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role . . . a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers . Sinatra's entrance is quite funny . Michele Morgan hears a knock at the door , and asks who's there . From outside , a Hoboken-toned voice answers ' Frank Sinatra ' . Sure enough . . . The opening credits of ' Higher and Higher ' may confuse some viewers , as the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are prominently displayed . In fact , they only contributed one song to this musical : ' Disgustingly Rich ' , which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song , ' I'm a Debutante ' . Interestingly , that Rodgers & Hart song - - one of their weakest - - is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score ; several others are lively up-tempo numbers , notably ' It's a Most Important Affair ' , ' When It Comes to Love , You're On Your Own ' and ' I Saw You First ' . Sinatra's good in this movie , but he would do better work ( and sing better material ) elsewhere . The real merits of ' Higher and Higher ' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films . Paul and Grace Hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several Broadway revues : genuinely graceful ballroom dancers , they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material . ( Here , Grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of Paul's hands . ) Grace Hartman , who died of cancer at age 48 , did almost no film work , so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up , to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform . After Grace Hartman's death , her husband had a long career as a character actor , just occasionally dancing solo . ( Or alongside Ken Berry in one memorable episode of ' Mayberry RFD ' . ) Also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in ' Higher and Higher ' is the vivacious teenage singer Marcy McGuire . Why didn't this talented girl make more movies ? Perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to Betty Hutton . I enjoy Hutton's performances but I like Marcy McGuire even better . Near the end of ' Higher and Higher ' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring McGuire and Mary Wickes as waitresses , taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub . The alternating strides of short McGuire and tall gawky Wickes are hilarious ! Regrettably , although Leon Errol plays a large role in ' Higher and Higher ' , he is given almost no comedy business : not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance . Jack Haley , despite his prominent billing , is also wasted . Very well-represented here is Dooley Wilson , inevitably remembered as Sam from ' Casablanca ' . In that film , Wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of ' As Time Goes By ' . ( In real life , Wilson couldn't play piano . ) Here in ' Higher and Higher ' , he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players . Less enjoyable is Mel Odious , I mean Mel Torme . Victor Borge gives a rare film performance here , handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows . The plot ? Forget it . ' Higher and Higher ' is nobody's idea of a ' great ' musical , but it's an enjoyable delight , and I'll rate it . Director Tim Whelan , who worked in Britain as well as in Hollywood , deserves to be much better known .

Bert Lahr starred in several musical revues on Broadway , but one of his rare successes in a ' book ' musical ( with a plotline ) was ' Flying High ' , a topical comedy which scored points off the aviation contests and wing-walking stunts that were so popular in America at this time . The plot is some froth about rival aviators competing for a transcontinental air race ; the winner to receive a large cash prize , fame , and so forth . Gordon is the wealthy playboy pilot who wants to sink his skyhooks into sweet little Eileen Cassidy . Bert Lahr , in fine form and looking surprisingly athletic , plays Rusty Krause , the airfield mechanic who is ( somewhat unwillingly ) engaged to Pansy ( Charlotte Greenwood ) , who seems to be some sort of airport groupie . Rusty , who has no piloting experience , accidentally goes aloft in an experimental ' aero-copter ' . Not willing to let her man fly away that easily , Pansy jumps on the tail of the ' copter just before it leaves the ground . Once they're up in the air , something goes wrong with the ' copter . While Rusty moans in terror , Pansy climbs out on the fuselage and fixes the rudder . Charlotte Greenwood is one of my favourite actresses : funny , intelligent , and extremely athletic despite her tall gawky physique . She often played super-competent women strangely attracted to weakling men . She's an utter delight here , doing her airborne acrobatics ( despite some bad process photography ) . When ' Flying High ' ran on Broadway , Lahr's leading lady was Kate Smith . . . yes , the moon-mountainous singer . I can't imagine how the stage production managed the climactic scene in the aero-copter , high above solid ground . . . and I also can't imagine the very plus-sized Kate Smith as Pansy , enacting a stagebound version of Charlotte Greenwood's acrobatics in this movie . That's not a cheap crack about Kate Smith's girth ; I'm forced to assume that her characterisation was very different from Greenwood's . The funniest scene in this film is Lahr's medical examination , in which Doc Brown straps him into a revolving drum and sends it spinning rapidly while Lahr howls in agony . But the best gag of all comes in the same scene , while Lahr's feet are on the ground . ( I'll set up the joke by mentioning that this movie was made during Prohibition , when every red-blooded American male carried a hip flask full of booze . ) The doctor hands Lahr an empty bottle and tells Lahr to give him a ' specimen ' . Lahr doesn't know what this means . Just as the doctor is about to explain , his phone rings . While on the phone , Doc Brown pantomimes to Lahr that he must fill up the bottle . As the doctor looks away , Lahr whips out his hip flask and fills the bottle with amber fluid . ( I assume it's amber ; this is a monochrome movie . ) Doc Brown rings off the phone , just in time for Lahr to hand him a full bottle and announce : ' Here y'go , Doc . I could only spare a quart . ' The sophisticated audiences on Broadway gave this line the biggest laugh of Lahr's career . It's a pity that Lahr is remembered only as the Cowardly Lion , and his brilliant comedy portrayals are forgotten . I'll rate ' Flying High ' .
418191	1609079	32796	8.0	Excellent second feature	' Millionaires in Prison ' is an excellent example of something that doesn't exist anymore , but which was commonplace in the days of the big Hollywood studios : the second feature . In the 1930s and ' 40s , Americans went to the movies expecting to receive a full evening's worth of entertainment : a double feature plus short subjects and a newsreel . The second feature ( which was actually first , as it was screened before the main feature ) typically had a shorter running time , lower budget and more obscure actors and director than the more prestigious main feature . . . but , at their best , the second features were always well-made and solidly entertaining in their own right . ' Millionaires in Prison ' is one of the very best examples of that tradition . The movie opens with a brisk but heavy-handed expository scene , featuring a newspaper editor named R . J . Reynolds . ( Could this be a plug for the tobacco company ? ) Reynolds is giving his reporters an assignment to do a story on four millionaire financiers who have recently been sent to prison for financial shenanigans . Interestingly , the editor tells his reporters in advance precisely how they're supposed to slant their reportage . ( This sort of thing happens all the time in the real world , but I've never seen it depicted in any other movie : in Movieland , reporters are always objective truth-seekers . ) Two of the millionaires , well-played by veteran actors Raymond Walburn and Thurston Hall , are befuddled fall guys who somehow took the rap for someone else's embezzlement . Reynolds tells his reporters ( and us ) that these lads are innocent , and he adds : ' Go easy on them , boys . ' On the other hand , the other two millionaires are outright crooks who are guilty as hell , and Reynolds gleefully tells his newshounds to pull all the stops out on them . Walburn and Hall give enjoyable performances , but the characters they're playing aren't very credible . It's difficult to believe that these two dimwits could ever have been successful financiers . They're in a fairly conventional prison ( not a Club Fed ) , doing hard time , yet they seem to think they're in some sort of country club . There's a nice complement of veteran film faces here , with Lee Tracy and Morgan Conway at their cynical best , and a welcome turn by Shemp Howard . Even the annoying Chester Clute , one of my most un-favourite actors , manages to be less annoying than usual here . I kept hoping there'd be a cellblock riot and Clute would get taken hostage . ( Or maybe a scene in the prison showers where Clute drops the soap . . . ) ' Millionaires in Prison ' is very ably directed by Ray McCarey , who was much less talented than his brother Leo McCarey but who was nonetheless a reliable director in his own right . Ray McCarey's work is long overdue for reappraisal , and ' Millionaires in Prison ' is a good place to start . I'll rate this film .
419240	1609079	14679	8.0	Sheikh hands with the devil .	There were two different film figures named Rex Ingram : interestingly , the English director Michael Powell worked with both of them . One of the two Rex Ingrams was an African-American actor who appeared in both film versions of ' The Thief of Bagdad ' . The other Rex Ingram was an Irish-born director who set up an independent film studio in France after establishing himself in Hollywood as a highly innovative auteur with a unique visual sense . Sadly , after proving himself one of the most distinctive visual stylists of the silent-film era , Ingram's career petered out rapidly with the coming of sound . It is this Rex Ingram - - not the black American actor - - whom fellow Irishman James Joyce praised in ' Finnegans Wake ' . It may well be that the director ' borrowed ' his name from the black actor : ironically , the director's real name was Hitchcock . . . perhaps he thought that nobody could be a successful film director with a name like Hitchcock ! ( All further references to ' Rex Ingram ' in this review apply to the Irish director , not the American actor . ) Throughout his career , Ingram showed a penchant for the exotic , but in later years he became increasingly interested in the culture and religion of Arab lands . The interest was sincere , apparently , as Ingram eventually converted to Islam . His film ' The Arab ' was based on an existing play , yet this movie appears to be a project which Ingram initiated , and which was deeply personal for him , as opposed to some studio assignment . I viewed an archive print of ' The Arab ' which had its original titles cut out and Russian translations spliced in . Fortunately , a Russian curator ( who wanted to see the film herself ) screened it with me and offered verbal translations of some of the titles . This review is based on the film's visual images and a second-hand version of the title cards . ( Why won't IMDb allow me to post ' intertitles ' as one word - - the proper term - - instead of breaking it up into two words ? ) CONTAINS SPOILERS . The setting is Syria , during a war with Turkey . ( I make no claims for the historical accuracy of this movie . ) Jamil is a soldier in the Bedouin defence forces , but he has deserted his regiment . In a remote village , he encounters an orphan asylum run by American missionaries : Mary Hilbert and her father . Jamil and Mary feel a mutual attraction . Meanwhile , the Turks are on their way to pillage the village . The leader of the villagers is identified in the Russian title cards as ' the Governor ' , but surely ' the Mayor ' is more accurate . The Governor ( sic ) , eager to placate the oncoming Turks , arranges for the children in the orphanage to be ' evacuated ' to Damascus for their safety : actually , he intends to hand them over to the Turkish invaders , knowing that the children will be slaughtered . Jamil is modest and self-effacing . Mary is a Christian and Jamil is ( at the moment ) a Moslem , yet he casually admits to her that he has been a Christian several times and will probably be one again . It seems that his convictions change as easily as the desert winds . But now some of Jamil's fellow Bedouins arrive . Will they shoot him as a deserter ? No . It turns out that Jamil is the son of the ruling sheikh . ( He was too modest to mention this . ) And it also turns out that Jamil's father has died , so now Jamil is the new sheikh . As soon as he assumes this mantle ( or burnoose ) , Jamil suddenly gains a sense of responsibility . He risks his own life to save the children , repel the Turks , and overthrow the corrupt Governor . Naturally , sweet Mary gets a case of the hots for him . There is an exciting climax . Earlier scenes in the film hinted that the passion between Mary and Jamil is doomed to failure , due to their differing cultures and faiths . But now Mary - - who has devoted her entire life to Christian works - - starts dropping hints that she might convert to Islam . Why not just let Jamil convert one more time , as he's had more experience at it ? Much of this movie is deeply implausible , but Ingram directs it with a panache and visual flair that make the film exhilarating even while we don't believe a word of it . One assumes that he brought his personal beliefs to this project . In the lead role , Ramon Novarro takes the bold step of playing Jamil as a protagonist who must earn our sympathy and respect , rather than having them from the start . Alice Terry ( Ingram's wife , and his leading lady in many of his films ) is far less effective in her portrayal of the young Christian missionary . She is quite beautiful and photogenic , but Terry's good looks actually work against her in this role : would a missionary in a remote location devote quite so much time to her hair and make-up ? I'm rating this very entertaining movie , but I may be overrating it slightly to compensate for the fact that I saw it in difficult circumstances .
418388	1609079	234114	8.0	Speed it up !	Here's an interesting American ' trick ' film which is much cruder than the trick films which Melies was doing in France at this time . Yet in some ways - - due to its fast action and use of exteriors - - this movie is more interesting than a typical Melies offering . I wonder if the makers of ' Liquid Electricity ' had read H . G . Wells's story ' The New Accelerator ' . We see a scientist with a Tintin cowlick , experimenting with a bizarre flywheel apparatus . He manages to distil some liquefied electricity , which he pours into a syringe . When he squirts some of this on himself , he runs around in accelerated motion . He then goes out to try it on other people . One sequence of this movie , with Brighton Beach Pier in the background , was filmed at almost the exact same spot as a scene in Vitagraph's later offering ' Jack Fat and Jim Slim at Coney Island ' ( 1910 ) . The scientist spots some boaters trying to rescue a drowning bather : he squirts some liquid electricity into the proceedings , and everyone moves at accelerated speed . The trick is done , of course , by undercranking : slowing the camera to lengthen the interval between frames . . . so that , when the film is projected at normal speed , the action is accelerated . It's unfortunate that the makers of ' Liquid Electricity ' undercrank a shot of the ocean : one of the lessons in Movie-making 101 is never to undercrank a shot of water , fire or smoke : the results will always look unnatural . Unfortunate for a different reason is a scene here in which the scientist encounters a Negro couple , played by a white man and woman in dark make-up . The husband lackadaisically whitewashes a wall : the scientist gives him a squirt of liquid electricity , and the black man works at superhuman speed while his black wife watches approvingly . Several scenes in this film are quite funny , but unfortunately the movie just ENDS , with no real punchline . I thought that perhaps a scene was missing from the end of the print , but apparently in 1907 the people at Vitagraph Studios were still learning how to tell a story with a punchline . I must correct the ( normally very perceptive ) IMDb reviewer Bob Lipton , who theorises that a rear-projection process is used in one sequence of this 1907 film , when the scientist moves at normal speed while one of his test subjects moves super-fast . In order to shoot a rear-projection sequence for this movie , the Vitagraph technicians would have been required to synchronise the gate mechanisms in the camera and the projector . . . very difficult to do in 1907 ! In fact , the trick here is something simpler ( yet more impressive ) than rear projection . If you watch the scientist closely in this sequence , you'll see that his movements in this scene - - and ONLY in this scene - - are very precise and deliberate , almost choreographed . It's obvious that the actor playing the scientist is actually moving very slowly , while the actor playing his test subject is moving at normal speed . Both actors are in the same set-up , with only one camera exposure . When the undercranked film is projected at normal speed , the test subject's movements are accelerated , while the scientist is moving normally ! This is very well done , and I regret that the film's credits don't identify the actor who plays the scientist . I'll rate this delightful movie .
418990	1609079	263371	8.0	Excellent live-action thriller	Several film critics ( notably Leslie Halliwell and William K Everson ) have made detailed comparisons between the 1940 ' Gaslight ' ( made in Britain ) and its better-known 1944 Hollywood remake . The general consensus is that the British version is better . Still , Ingrid Bergman is very beautiful and compelling in the MGM remake , and I especially enjoyed the splendid performance in that version by underrated character actress Heather Thatcher ( wearing a period costume that shows off her very attractive physique ) . Both films have their separate strengths ; how fortunate that we're able to enjoy both , and compare them . This early telefilm of ' Gas Light ' ( a two-word title in the opening credits ) was a live broadcast of Patrick Hamilton's stage play ( brought to Broadway as ' Angel Street ' ) , which was running at the Apollo Theatre in London's West End . On 19 March 1939 , the cast of the stage play went to Alexandra Palace to repeat their performances for the BBC's cameras . This is a stagey production in every sense of the term , but it has its merits . Gwen Ffrangon-Davies is cast in the central role as Bella Manningham , the tormented wife . Despite her patrician name , Ffrangon-Davis was not physically beautiful , but this actually brings plausibility to her performance . As much as I enjoyed the two later film versions of ' Gaslight ' , in both cases the female protagonist was played by an actress of such stunning beauty ( Diana Wynyard , Ingrid Bergman ) that I found it hard to believe she would marry so desperately . Ffrangon-Davies begins her performance with a neatly coiffured hairstyle that becomes gradually more unkempt as she descends into madness . As this is a live broadcast , I couldn't tell if the deterioration of her hairstyle was intentional ( very clever , if so ) , or merely down to the hazards of live performance . In the climactic scene , in which Bella threatens to kill her husband , Ffrangon-Davies wears a gaudy patterned frock that emphasises her appropriately haggard appearance . The villain of this piece - Jack Manningham , the abusive husband - is played by Dennis Arundell , dapper of costume and cultured of voice but far less handsome and suave than Anton Walbrook and Charles Boyer in the later film versions . Whereas Ffrangon-Davies's lack of beauty adds plausibility to her role , Arundell's unpleasant looks detract from his character's plausibility . He has a moustache that looks as if a caterpillar has taken lodgings on his upper lip . As the husband in this stage version is less attractive and much less charming than Walbrook and Boyer in the film versions , it's less clear why Bella ever decided to marry him . Arundell gives a fascinating performance as the sadistic husband , but his cruelty is too obvious from the outset . Walbrook and Boyer were much better suited to this role : in both cases , they played handsome charmers whose cruelty didn't become obvious until the wife was trapped . Milton Rosmer is rather stolid and insufficiently heroic as Inspector Rough , the detective . Elizabeth Inglis and Beatrice Rowe are briefly impressive in their roles as the Manninghams ' servants . The action here is similar to the 1940 film version , but confined entirely to a single stage set . Modern productions of ' Angel Street ' ( a later version of this same play ) feature a clever piece of stage business in which Inspector Rough accidentally leaves his hat on the Manninghams ' table just before the husband returns , then must retrieve the hat without revealing his presence . Regrettably , that very suspenseful bit of business is absent here : it was created during rehearsals for the Broadway debut of ' Angel Street ' , when Leo G . Carroll ( as Rough ) actually did leave his hat onstage by accident ! I'll rate this tele-version of ' Gas Light ' , mostly for its historical value . UPDATE : The actress who played the maid in this drama - - Elizabeth Inglis - - later became Sigourney Weaver's mother . Her husband was Sylvester ( " Pat " ) Weaver , a major figure in U . S . television . On the only occasion when I met Mr Weaver , we briefly discussed his wife's acting career , and he praised her performance in ' Gas Light ' . As he had not yet met her at the time this performance was transmitted , I must assume that he saw a recording of the performance years later . Elizabeth Inglis was a beautiful and talented actress , and I regret that her career was not more extensive . . . although , in her case , this was obviously by choice .
419707	1609079	483279	8.0	She's from France , she can dance . . . but more prettily in Italy .	This movie takes place in Italy but the scenery looks as if it was filmed in France . The heroine is identified ( in the intertitles ) as French , but there's no particular reason for her to be French apart from the fact that the actress who plays her is French . In a sound film , this sort of backstory is necessary to cover casting problems such as a French actress who can't do a convincing Italian accent . Since this is a silent film , with the actors ' voices unheard , there's really no need for such pretexts . Anyhow : the very sensuous actress Regina Badet portrays a French dancer cried Manuella , which sounds like a Spanish name to me . She is touring Italy with her two musicians , Marco ( Marc Gerard ) and Lionel ( Andree Lionel ) . The latter is also her lover , and they're quite open about it . When Count Rezzi ( Gabriel Signoret ) sees the buskers performing , he is aroused with lust for Manuella . He is dismayed to discover that Manuella and Lionel are quite happy with things as they are . ( I was hoping that the very attractive Ma'mselle Badet would add a long flowing train to her costume , so that the faithful Lionel would be her train-bearer . Lionel train , geddit ? ) Meanwhile , Marco is aroused by the count's wealth . He tries to steal some of the count's jewels . The count catches Marco red-handed . Instead of demanding the return of his property , Count Rezzi blackmails Marco into planting the jewels on Lionel . Then the count arranges for the jewels to be discovered on the person of the guiltless Lionel , who didn't even know he was holding them . Now get this , folks . By means of some surprisingly subtle acting by the cast , with a minimum of explanatory titles , Lionel comes to the mistaken conclusion that Manuella nicked the dazzlers and planted them on his person . . . so Lionel pleads guilty to the theft in order to protect Manuella ! Delighted by this turn of events , the count has Lionel hustled off the hoosegow . ( Armand Tallier portrays the carabiniere . ) SPOILERS COMING . Manuella has been established as a poor wandering entertainer , but somehow she's managed to come into possession of a loaded revolver . Concealing this in her skirts , she pays a call upon the count and begs him to withdraw the charge against Lionel . Twirling his moustache in all directions , Count Rezzi declares that he will happily withdraw the charge . . . if Manuella will first become his " light of love " ( that's how the intertitles put it ; it feels a bit less ludicrous in French ) . Manuella whips out her piece ( the revolver , I mean ) and tries to shoot Count Rizzi . They struggle for the weapon , and the count accidentally shoots himself . Realising that he's done for , he clears Lionel . The lovers are happily reunited . Mama mia ! I didn't like the climax of this movie . Manuella is prepared to commit murder for the sake of her lover , but Count Rezzi conveniently shoots himself instead . . . thus achieving what Manuella set out to accomplish while leaving her technically innocent of murder . Even more conveniently , the count manages to live long enough to clear the accused man . On the positive side , there are some spectacularly beautiful exterior shots in this French film . The costumes and production design are excellent , and the actors ' performances are far more naturalistic than I expected for this operatic sort of story . My rating for this one :
419020	1609079	11301	8.0	Crude but funny .	In 1907 , the San Francisco Chronicle's cartoonist Bud Fisher began a comic strip called " Mr A . Mutt " , depicting the adventures of Augustus Mutt , a hapless punter and railbird . The tall lanky Mutt soon found visual contrast in Jeffries , a runty little wiseguy named for a recent heavyweight boxing champ . Soon retitled " Mutt and Jeff " , the comic strip became phenomenally successful , to the point where Bud Fisher owned 50 thoroughbred racehorses and employed a stableful of anonymous ' assistants ' to write and draw his strip . Hugely popular for decades , the strip is now entirely forgotten except as a piece of American police jargon : when describing two suspects who travel together - - one tall , one short - - the police will refer to them as ' a Mutt and Jeff ' . ' Home Sweet Home ' is one of the dozens of Mutt and Jeff cartoons released under Bud Fisher's name , though it's impossible to know how much of the actual drawing and scripting he did . Still , this cartoon captures the look and humour of his classic strip , and therefore it's quite funny . SPOILERS COMING . Mutt's wife is going out for the evening . Mutt wants to sneak out for a night of carousing with Jeff , but Mrs Mutt orders her husband to get to bed early . Jeff stands lookout , and gives Mutt the high sign : as soon as his wife has gone , Mutt shinnies down the drainpipe . Whoops ! The wife forgot something ! Mutt must shinny up the drainpipe again , and he gets back into bed just in time . Finally , she's gone . Mutt and Jeff scurry into the Dutchman's saloon . ( This cartoon was released during Prohibition ; I assume that it was already in production before the Volstead Act took effect . ) Mutt and Jeff go staggering homeward at 3 a . m . , thoroughly drunk . But by now the wife must be waiting . Mutt urges Jeff to go upstairs ahead of him , telling Jeff ' My wife thinks the world of you . ' When Jeff goes upstairs , Mrs Mutt coshes him with a rolling pin . Jeff goes downstairs and tells Mutt the coast is clear . ( This is a running theme in Fisher's strip : the perennial willingness of these buddies to betray each other . ) Mutt goes upstairs , all unsuspecting , and gets thoroughly lambasted by his wife . Tossed out , he dejectedly tells Jeff ' My wife hates me ! ' Jeff shows Mutt the lump on his own noggin , and replies ' She thinks the world of me ! ' The animation in this toon is extremely crude , even by 1920 standards . . . yet it's streets ahead of the even cruder animation technique employed by Rube Goldberg in ' The Boob Weekly ' only 4 years earlier . Whereas Goldberg had to re-draw each scene in its entirety for every frame of animation , in ' Home Sweet Home ' Fisher is able to employ acetate cels , so that the background remains constant during action in the foreground . Several times during this brief toon , Mutt shinnies up or down the very long drainpipe connecting his upstairs flat's window to street level . The camera does long vertical pans up and down the side of Mutt's apartment building . I kept looking for joins or seams in this background , but I found none : apparently Fisher placed his animated figures against a single long vertical background . Well done ! But the animation overall is extremely jerky , with each position of the figures occupying several consecutive frames . The dialogue is expressed comic-book style , in hand-lettered balloons above the characters ' heads . This is appropriate to the overall look of the toon , but Fisher employs some very strange line breaks and punctuation in his speech balloons . When Mrs Mutt beats up her husband , the action is cleverly staged off-screen , with only sound-effects balloons to tell us what's happening : this is easier to animate and also funnier than if we saw the action directly . All in all , I'll rate this very amusing cartoon .
418744	1609079	167050	9.0	Hilariously relevant to our own times .	' Billy and the Big Stick ' is a comedy dealing with the expansionist policies of the United States in the years leading up to the First World War . As I watched this film , nearly a century after it was made , I was amazed at how extremely relevant this movie is to current United States policy and international relations . Also , this movie is hilarious ! The titular ' big stick ' is figurative , referring to the African proverb made famous by Theodore Roosevelt : ' Speak softly but carry a big stick , and you will go far . ' The film takes place in a Caribbean banana republic which the intertitles identify as ' Hayti ' . I'm not sure if this is supposed to be the real-world nation of Haiti , or if the spelling change indicates that this Hayti is a fictional place : the Caribbean version of Graustark or Ruritania . Anyway , the president of Hayti is played by a white actor , which would seem to indicate that this is a fictional country . ( The real-world Haiti being governed by French Africans . ) Billy Barlow ( a briskly energetic performance by Raymond McKee ) is the foreign agent for a U . S . utility company . He manages the power plant supplying electricity to Hayti , for which service his Yank employers are supposed to make a profit . But Hayti's president Poussevain has nationalised the electrical plant . He expects Billy to carry on supplying electricity to the Haytian people , but refuses to pay for it . Billy is in love with a native maiden , Claire Ducrot . This role is played by Yona Landowska , an actress I've never heard of before . In this film , she displays an exotic beauty and a sensuous presence that make me eager to see more of her film roles . Billy wants to get the hell out of Hayti ( good move ) and take Claire with him ( even better move ) , but first he's got to collect the substantial amount of money which Poussevain owes him ( possibly fatal move ) . By great good luck , along comes a Yankee battleship , and aboard the battleship is Harry St Clair , the handsome ( and vain , and stupid ) matinée idol of American films . St Clair is about to shoot a naval film , with himself in the lead , and for realism's sake the U . S . Navy have loaned him a ship , with a full crew complement and guns . SPOILERS COMING . Billy urges St Clair to get into his costume as a U . S . naval officer , and then he brings him to the president . It's been previously established that Poussevain speaks only French , whilst St Clair speaks only English . In an hilarious climax , Billy serves as interpreter for the two , deliberately mistranslating their dialogue so as to convince Poussevain that St Clair is a genuine naval officer preparing to attack , whilst telling St Clair that Poussevain is a fan of St Clair's movies , and would like to see him perform something . Harry St Clair is played by Bradley Barker , an actor quite unknown to me . What a discovery ! He's very convincing as the foppish egotistical matinée idol , histrionically emoting for his ' fan ' Poussevain while being too vain to understand what's really happening . It's unfortunate that this movie is silent , as the climactic scene requires one character to be speaking French and another to be speaking English , whilst Billy acts as interpreter . . . the catch being that Billy's translations are fake , and the audience realise this while the other characters don't catch wise . In a sound film , this could have been achieved with subtitles on screen while the actors are speaking in their own voices . But this movie is silent , so we're stuck with the unwieldy device of Poussevain's dialogue being rendered in English-language intertitles ( even though he's speaking French ) , and then having Billy say something else entirely which is ostensibly a translation . There are some fascinating shots of U . S . naval ships and artillery pieces . Unfortunately , it's blatantly obvious that these shots are stock footage ; the lighting in these shots doesn't match the rest of the movie . And some unbilled bit players get rather heavy-handed in their depiction of ignorant foreigners . ' Billy and the Big Stick ' is a well-paced comedy with a far-fetched plot that's all too plausible , and ( as I write this ) amazingly relevant to the politics of the early 21st century . McKee , Barker and Landowska give impressive performances , and the latter is quite sexy . Director Edward H Griffith deserves to be better known ; he's in top form here . I'll rate ' Billy and the Big Stick ' .
418423	1609079	37661	9.0	Jessica Rabbit meets Virgil Partch	Virgil Partch , who signed his name ' ViP ' , was a magazine and newspaper cartoonist noted for his clean uncluttered linework and weirdly surrealistic humour . Although ViP was definitely an original , his subject matter is similar to that of Gahan Wilson , Arnold Roth and the great Basil Wolverton . The very first issue of Playboy magazine had two illustrations on its cover : a photo of Marilyn Monroe , and a drawing by ViP , with a caption stating that more ViP cartoons were inside . If it's good enough for Playboy , it's good enough for me . Oddly , the short Disney cartoon ' Duck Pimples ' seems to be Virgil Partch's one and only foray into film animation . . . odd , because it's a complete success which should have brought Partch similar job assignments . The credits of ' Duck Pimples ' list Partch only as scriptwriter , but the characters in this cartoon ( except for Donald Duck ) show the clear influence of Partch's linework , and they don't resemble other Disney characters from this period . I'm positive that Partch must have drawn the model sheets for these characters , and he may well have drawn key poses for the characters as well . This is a fun cartoon that the whole family will enjoy : it has Disney's high production values , yet ( despite the presence of Donald Duck ) it isn't a typical Disney cartoon . The title ' Duck Pimples ' is awkward : the opening title card bears the title ' Goose Pimples ' , with ' Goose ' crossed out and ' Duck ' written underneath . Either way , the title doesn't make much sense , because this cartoon doesn't have a scary theme . At the beginning , Donald Duck is alone in his house on a dark night , reading a spooky story . There's one very clever visual device , as Donald's armchair gradually morphs into a green monster underneath his body . Even small children will recognise that this is a symptom of Donald's imagination , not an actual event . But after this clever image , the cartoon veers away from scary themes into the wild surrealism typical of Partch's magazine cartoons . Even the story in Donald's book moves away from scary themes into whodunnit territory . The characters in Donald's story leap out of the book and start haranguing him . Among these is a police detective with an Irish brogue , his voice supplied ( uncredited ) by silent-film comedian and longtime voice artist Billy Bletcher . Also present is Pauline , a sexy female cartoon character who seems to be a prototype for Jessica Rabbit . The action is weird and fast-paced , more typical of Bob Clampett at Warners during this same period than anything Disney was doing at this time . But the violence in ' Duck Pimples ' is negligible ( which was seldom true of Clampett ) , and the whole film is delightful except for a very weak final gag . I'll rate ' Duck Pimples ' .
419720	1609079	31944	9.0	Betty Boop gives a lube job .	I'm not a fan of Betty Boop , but ' So Does an Automobile ' is one of her more enjoyable cartoons . It features Betty in a storyline that doesn't require us to accept her as beautiful or voluptuous . ( Honestly : if you saw a real woman who looked and sounded like Betty Boop - - that gigantic head , that tiny mouth , that perpetual whimper - - would you actually be pleased ? More likely , you'd scream and run away in disgust . ) In this cartoon , Betty is running a service garage for anthropomorphised cars that look like Benny the Cab from ' Who Framed Roger Rabbit ' : really more of a car hospital than anything else . As she ministers to the cars , Betty sings a very catchy tune , every verse of which ends with the song's title , and all the verses make comparisons between humans and cars . A person needs some sympathy , and ' so does an automobile ' . And so on . In addition to the very pleasant song - - which keeps Betty from doing her usual breathy whimpering - - there's also an extremely funny payoff gag , which should be easy to figure out if you look at this movie's title while considering the Fleischer studio's penchant for risqué gags . Still , by Fleischer standards that last gag is quite clean . I might even call it " auto " erotic . I'll rate this delightful movie 9 in 10 .
418770	1609079	25388	9.0	What a great railway engine !	' Love and the First Railway ' is what this movie's title would mean in English . This is one of those films that depicts fictional characters participating in an historic incident . The actual first railway was built in England , of course . But according to this movie , the first railway ( in Germany , at least ) was built from Berlin to Potsdam , in 1838 . I haven't the faintest idea if that's correct , but the people who made this movie do seem to take a great deal of interest in historical accuracy , so I'll take their word for it . Anyway , a title at the beginning establishes that this movie is set in 1838 . Jakob Tiedtke is a provincial postmaster who earns his main livelihood as the owner / operator of a local stagecoach . His daughter ( Karin Hardt , quite pretty ) meets a handsome young surveyor ( Hans Schlenck , not a very good actor ) who is the construction foreman for the new eisenbahn ( ' iron-road ' ) being built between Berlin and Potsdam . Karin's father is positive that the new-fangled steam engines will never replace time-tested reliable horse-drawn transit . Karin and her mother ( Ida Wüst ) are enthusiastic about the railway , because it will bring new business and development to their village . But if the railway succeeds , then Karin's father's stagecoach business will become obsolete . . . Although ' Love and the First Railway ' is basically a period romance , there is some slapstick humour ( mostly from Fritz Kampers ) which is more effective than I expected it to be . Most impressive of all is the vintage railway engine that appears in this film . I know a fair amount about early 19th-century British railway engines , but very little about their German counterparts . The fully functional choo-choo in this movie is either an actual railway engine circa 1838 ( still in good nick , 100 years on ! ) , or else a painstakingly accurate modern re-creation . Either way , I'm extremely impressed . If that train engine had remained offscreen , I might have rated this movie . The presence of the engine hikes this movie's rating up to a near-perfect 9 , and it also makes this movie required viewing for anybody interested in 19th-century railways . All aboard !
419098	1609079	71024	9.0	I'll chime in : this mystery has a peal .	" Nine tailors make a man " , which explains why Adolphe Menjou ( Hollywood's best-dressed actor ) titled his memoir " It Took Nine Tailors " . In Dorothy Sayers's novel ( and this adaptation ) , the title refers to a Church of England tradition : the parish bell chimes nine " tailors " ( tolls ) to mark the death of a man , six for a woman , three for a child . Here we have a splendid example of authorial obsession : Sayers was deeply interested in change-ringing , a rarefied activity even in her day . . . and nowadays downright obscure . I would need several thousand words to explain change-ringing properly . Basically , a peal begins with all the ringers tolling in an agreed sequence . In each successive change , any given ringer will chime at either the same point in the sequence as last time round , or one position before or after that position . . . never altering by more than one in a single change . Ideally ( though not always in real life ) , the peal continues until every possible mathematical combination has been rung ONCE only . ( The number of changes in a full peal depends on how many bells are used . ) Unfortunately , Sayers assumes that all her readers ( and now her viewers ) are as fascinated by this subject as she was . Throughout " The Nine Tailors " , campanological terms like " Treble Bob " and " Tailor Paul " are tossed about with no explanation . Ian Carmichael always had the advantage of being able to choose his projects , and he only ever worked in quality productions . All his Lord Peter Wimsey miniseries are excellent , but " The Nine Tailors " is the one I recommend for viewing first , as this one establishes the relationship between Lord Peter and his invaluable valet Bunter ( the excellent Glyn Houston ) . A prologue shows them meeting in the Great War , with Bunter saving his subaltern and becoming Lord Peter's batman . SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . I agree with IMDb reviewer " hgallon " that the identity of a corpse in this mystery is too easy to guess . ( This reflects one of the teleplay's few deviations from the original novel . ) The villain has cut off the dead man's hands and head , hoping to nobble identification : nowadays , of course , DNA would reveal all . IMDb's reviewer Fisher Forrest is technically correct about an error in change-ringing protocol , but change-ringing hobbyists ( such as Miss Sayers herself ) would overlook this . Come to that , the " rules " require all change-ringers to be male , but Dorothy Sayers was an enthusiastic pealer herself . In the last chapter of this miniseries is a detail that I disliked . Lord Peter needs to access Church of England records , so he casually rings up his friend the Archbishop of Canterbury . There's an old film cliché stating that , when a real person is briefly portrayed by an actor , the actor is photographed in three-quarter rear view to avoid the aggro of finding a lookalike . See for instance the depiction of Franklin D . Roosevelt in " Yankee Doodle Dandy " or of Walt Disney in " Once Upon a Time " . Here in " The Nine Tailors " , the actor briefly portraying the Archbishop is shown from that same angle . . . but , really , how many viewers in 1974 ( or later ) had any notion of what the Archbishop looked like forty years earlier ? The production design throughout this miniseries is a delight - - plenty of campanology , very little camp - - as is the ripe British dialogue . One crusty Englishman , confronting a French letter ( quiet , you ! ) , confesses : " I never could parley-voo . " I'm slightly annoyed by Carmichael's attempts at Bertie Wooster diction , clipping his words and saying " ain't " . Admittedly , Sayers deserves some of the blame . SPOILER . The climactic scene of " The Nine Tailors " places Lord Peter in a deadly situation , but some viewers may be sceptical as to its fatal dimensions . This is something that Sayers got very right indeed , and Lord Peter is in genuine peril . My rating for these nine tailors is nine points out of 10 . Well done , m'lord !
419082	1609079	13741	9.0	Fascinating Egyptian epic	I viewed an incomplete print of ' The Wife of the Pharaoh ' that was reconstructed ( from several sources ) by Stephan Droessler of the Film Museum in Munich . Even in remnant form , this is a phenomenal film : an epic piece of film-making , with 6 , 000 extras and elaborate sets . ' The Wife of the Pharaoh ' is the nearest Ernst Lubitsch came to making a film like ' Metropolis ' . ' The Wife of the Pharaoh ' was released in 1922 , the same year that Englishman Howard Carter unsealed Tutankhamen's tomb . . . but at this time , much of the most important work in Egyptology was being done by Germans , and German interest in ancient Egypt was high indeed . This film is set in dynastic Egypt ( Middle Kingdom , by the look of it ) . . . and the sets , costumes and props are vastly more convincing than anything done by Hollywood in this same era in films such as ' King of Kings ' , " Noah's Ark " and the Babylonian sequences of ' Intolerance ' . There are of course a few errors in this movie : the elaborate Double Crown symbolising the two kingdoms of Egypt is the proper size and shape , yet the actors heft it about so easily that it's clearly a prop made from some improbably light substance . The pharaoh receives papyrus scrolls bearing messages written in hieroglyphics ; this is wrong ( the messages would have been written in hieratic , and the king would probably require a scribe to read them on his behalf ) , yet somebody made a commendable effort to use the proper hieroglyphics . . . which is more than Universal Studios bothered to do in any of those 1930s mummy flicks . Emil Jannings gives an operatic performance as the ( fictional ) king Amenes . The king of the Ethiopians ( Paul Wegener ) , hoping to make peace with Egypt , offers his daughter Theonis to become the wife of Amenes . But Theonis falls in love with Ramphis , the handsome son of the king's advisor Sothis . ( Ramphis wears a hairdo stolen from Prince Valiant : one of the few really ludicrous errors in this film . ) Amenes sentences the lovers to death , then offers to spare Ramphis from execution ( sentencing him to hard labour for life ) if Theonis will consent to love only Amenes . There are some truly spectacular scenes in this film , very impressive even in the partial form which I viewed . Paul Wegener gives a fine performance as Samlak , king of the Ethiopians , but he looks like he escaped from a minstrel show : to portray an Ethiopian , Wegener wears blackface and body make-up , and a truly terrible Afro wig . Also , since his daughter Theonis is presumably also an Ethiopian , why is she white ? There are fine performances by Lyda Salmonova as a ( white ) Ethiopian slave-girl ( the nearest equivalent to Aida in this operatic story ) and by Albert Bassermann as the advisor who is spitefully blinded at the pharaoh's order . Theodor Sparkuhl's camera work is superlative , as always , and the art direction is brilliant . Although I viewed only an incomplete version of this film , I've read a surviving screenplay ; the script ( with some lapses in logic ) is definitely the most ludicrous part of this film . But the favourable aspects of this movie very definitely outweigh its flaws . I'll rate ' The Wife of the Pharaoh ' .
418572	1609079	7983	9.0	Wiene is good , but Veidt is brilliant .	I saw ' Furcht ' in July 1996 at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna . They screened a print with the original German intertitles , loaned by the Deutsches Institut für Filmkunde . One of my all-time favourite films is ' The Cabinet of Dr Caligari ' , which is by far the most famous movie directed by Robert Wiene . However , that film was in pre-production with Fritz Lang intended as the director ; Wiene stepped in only at the last moment , and much of the movie's appeal is due to the remarkable production design ( by Hermann Warm ) or other factors for which Wiene cannot take credit . ' Furcht ' is a more accurate representation of Wiene's directorial talents : it's not nearly so good as ' Caligari ' ( few films are ! ) , but Wiene proves himself able to create an eerie dream-like mood which suits this story admirably . Whereas the events in ' Caligari ' are clearly a madman's nightmare , the nightmarish story of ' Furcht ' seems to be more firmly rooted in reality and sanity , and only gradually do we begin to feel that the events on the screen may be the protagonist's nightmare rather than his reality . . . or perhaps they are both , in which case he has no escape . Bruno Decarli plays a European aristocrat in Java . He takes a fancy to a weird-looking statue of a local pagan god , which is protected by an even weirder-looking priest ( played by Conrad Veidt , who is apparently portraying a Hindu ) . Decarli decides to steal the statue ; in order to achieve this , he murders the priest . However , the priest's ghost haunts Decarli , warning him that he will die in seven days ' time . . . Conrad Veidt was one of the best actors in silent films . He seemed rather less successful in talkies , possibly down to having aged a few years and lost the knife-edge of his virility . In ' Furcht ' , Veidt is astonishingly thin and absolutely compelling as a wraith . I've seen hundreds of actors portray ghosts , but Veidt's performance here is one of the very few which convinced me that the character was actually speaking from the realm of the dead . Veidt's gaunt appearance and his expressive hands skilfully convey the incessant hunger of the dead and their resentment of the living . I'll rate this movie , and I wish that Weine's films came up to this standard more often .
418596	1609079	215575	10.0	An actor is kept in suspense .	This is one of the very best of Georges Melies's many ' trick ' films . Interestingly , the English-language prints of this film render its title as ' The Black Imp ' rather than the more accurate ' The Black Devil ' . . . probably because English-language audiences would interpret the word ' devil ' to mean THE Devil , and presumably His Satanic Majesty has got more important things to do than just fool about with furniture . The major item in Melies's cinematic bag of tricks was the jump cut - - in which the camera's motion is stopped while an object or person is moved to a new position , then the camera is restarted - - so that something or somebody suddenly appears , disappears , changes position , or switches place with something else . More than fifty years after Melies , this same camera trick was still being used in such sophisticated fare as ' Bewitched ' and ' Lost in Space ' . One problem with the jump cut is that the actors on screen who aren't part of the transformation often have difficulty staying absolutely motionless during the transition . . . so , the effect of the jump cut is often diluted because somebody who wasn't supposed to move has unintentionally ' jumped ' to another position , impairing the illusion . This happened far too often in Melies's films . Even if all the actors behave themselves , there's often a shift in the lighting or some other unintended change which calls attention to the jump in the film . SLIGHT SPOILERS . One reason why ' The Black Devil ' delights me is because the jump cuts are unusually seamless . There are none of those lurching transitions which ruin so many jump cuts . Also , Melies has used the gimmick much more imaginatively here than in several of his other films . It's simple enough to use the jump cut to make one object appear , disappear or move by itself . In ' The Black Devil ' , very amusingly , Melies uses camera sorcery to make a long series of identical chairs appear in rapid-fire succession from the same point in midair . Unexpected and hilarious ! I was especially impressed by one particular jump cut , due to the physical difficulties for the actor involved . We see a bearded man attempt to put his coat in a drawer while the Black Devil keeps magically rearranging the furniture . At one point , the bureau materialises on top of the table , forcing the poor bearded bloke to climb onto the table to open a bureau drawer . Instantly , the bureau and the table both move to other locations . . . leaving the man in midair for just a fraction of an instant before gravity claims him . Now , think about what was involved in that shot . In order to get the effect , the actor had to suspend himself several feet above the floor while the camera operator checked his lighting , and so forth . The man must remain suspended until the camera starts , then he must fall immediately . If he dangles in midair for even a second , we'll have time to see how the trick is done . Thanks to the miracle of Rewind , I was able to replay this section of the film several times , until at last I saw how the actor was able to keep himself suspended till the crucial moment . Elsewhere in this same short film , we see part of the scenery put on fire , deliberately . I was quite surprised by this , as stage sets ( and inexpensive film sets ) are often highly flammable , and an intentional flame can rapidly get out of control . But Melies shows a sure hand here , and nothing happens which isn't in the script . Although Georges Melies's films are typically charming and funny , modern viewers will often easily spot the joins and junctures where his stage tricks are trundled into place . ' The Black Devil ' , refreshingly , is a seamless piece of screen magic , and it's still quite funny after all these years . My rating : .
419719	1609079	10929	10.0	Unemployment , fun enjoyment !	Silent-film star Wallace Reid is ( like Roscoe Arbuckle ) unfairly remembered for a scandal which didn't accurately reflect his true life or career . Reid played clean-cut young men , until his sudden death revealed a history of morphine abuse . This was actually the fault of front-office executives at Reid's home studio , who forced him to keep working under heavy medication after he was injured in a railway accident while en-route to a film location . After Reid's death , the same studio tried to protect its own image by circulating rumours that Reid had led a double life as a secret drugs addict . Reid usually played a brash go-getter , a somewhat more leading-man version of Harold Lloyd . Reid's best director - - they made several films together - - was James Cruze , whose career is direly in need of reappraisal . Cruze's directorial talents were underrated in his lifetime , and he is now unfairly forgotten . Fortunately , Cruze invested his money well . Apparently , in his last years , he lived quite contentedly at Hollywood's periphery and he didn't much care about posterity . In ' You're Fired ' Reid plays Bill Deering , a devil-may-care playboy who proposes to society girl Helen Rogers . Her father Gordon Rogers forbids the engagement , asserting that Bill will never amount to anything . At the stroke of midnight , Rogers proposes a wager : if Bill can stay employed for three months , without being sacked , Rogers will consent to the marriage . In a series of amusing vignettes , we see Bill trying his hand at various jobs of work , and invariably mucking them up until dismissal is imminent . On the brink of being fired from his first job , he takes a second job before quitting the first . . . so that he remains employed yet escapes his first job without getting fired . As he can't hold the second job either , he takes a third job before quitting the second , and so forth . The comedy comes from Bill's widely varying types of ineptitude . He has no skills , so all the jobs he gets are manual labour , and he rapidly develops blisters on both hands . I laughed heartily at a gag when the burly actor Theodore Roberts grabs Reid's hand and pumps it enthusiastically . . . and Reid jumps a foot into the air . Eventually , Bill gets a job at a restaurant as a decorative doorman . At last he seems to be doing well . . . until Helen and her father turn up for dinner at the restaurant . As luck would have it , tonight's the last night of the wager . Helen summons the restaurant's proprietor , and she demands that the doorman serve their dinner , even though Bill has no experience as a waiter . Then , Helen and her father keep Bill busy , constantly ordering him to fetch various items at top speed . It's clear that the Rogerses are trying to get Bill sacked before midnight . As Helen Rogers , Wanda Hawley gives a remarkable performance here . She seems genuinely to be in love with Reid's Bill Deering and to want to marry him . . . yet at the same time she clearly takes a cruel pleasure in forcing him to wait upon her and obey her orders . I was deeply impressed that Hawley was able to convey these conflicting motivations while retaining the audience's sympathy . It's not often that a film depicts a beautiful woman compelling a man to serve her , unless the woman is depicted as some sort of virago . If you want to see a sexy woman forcing a man to wait upon her hand and foot , while she clearly enjoys his humiliation - - and the whole thing played for comedy - - you'll be delighted by the climactic scenes of this movie . SPOILERS COMING . Like several other Reid comedies , this movie veers deeply into slapstick territory . . . yet Reid's hero remains realistic and believable , even more so than is the case with Harold Lloyd . It's no surprise that Bill Deering manages to avoid getting fired before the stroke of midnight . . . at which point he eagerly claims his bride . ( Hmm , maybe our Bill enjoys being dominated . ) There's some delightful supporting comedy by Raymond Hatton as the kappelmeister of an oom-pah band , but Wallace Reid is funny enough that he doesn't need the assistance . The inter-titles are witty too , with some delightful hand-painted backgrounds . I'll rate ' You're Fired ' .
418931	1609079	279760	10.0	Delightful low-budget musical	The 1967 TV production of the Broadway musical " Damn Yankees ! " is not as well-known as the 1958 Warner Brothers film version . But the TV version has some merits which the movie version lacks : it's an excellent alternative version of the same story , told on a much smaller budget . One of the best songs in the Broadway show " Damn Yankees " was " The Game " , a slam-bang up-tempo number for male trio , with hilarious lyrics . For some reason , this song was left out of the film version ( except as background music during the opening credits and montages ) . The TV version of " Damn Yankees ! " restores this hilarious song " The Game " , and it's a highlight of the show . Lacking the glitz of the movie version , the TV version of " Damn Yankees ! " makes a virtue of its low budget . Only three members of the Washington Senators baseball team are played by live actors : the rest of the team are " played " by plywood cut-outs painted to look like baseball players . This sounds like a dumb idea , but it's actually handled well . . . especially during the victory scene in the locker room , when one of the flesh-and-blood athletes shares a handshake and some shaving cream with one of his plywood team-mates . Throughout this TV show , there are clever ways of distracting us from the low budget . During the famous song " Heart " , when the three ballplayers sing the line " It's nice to be a genius , of course " , we see cut-outs of their heads moving back and forth in front of crude animation of some meshing gears . When they sing " Keep that old horse before the cart " , we see some silent-film stock footage of a horse rearing up in front of a cart . The lead role of Mr . Applegate ( alias the Devil ) is played here by Phil Silvers , and he's at the top of his form in a performance that owes nothing to Ray Walston's portrayal of this role in the film version . Phil Silvers gives his own unique interpretation of the Devil . Try to imagine Sergeant Bilko as Lucifer , and that's what you'll see here . Hilarious ! Fran Allison ( of " Kukla , Fran and Ollie " ) gives an excellent performance as Meg Boyd , and it's a pleasure to see her interacting with humans instead of puppets . During the scene in the baseball commissioner's office , there's supposed to be a crowd of reporters . . . but the production budget can't afford a crowd of actors , so Fran Allison speaks directly to the camera and she reacts as if she's speaking to a hostile crowd of reporters . She handles an awkward role extremely well . Linda Lavin ( making her TV debut ) is superb in her role as Gloria the sportswriter . She does splendid work in her big number ( " Shoeless Joe from Hannibal , Mo . " ) and her " Shifty McCoy " scene with Phil Silvers is the funniest in the whole show . There are some minuses here , notably Lee Remick's limp performance as Lola the temptress . Lola is supposed to start out unsympathetic , then become heroic as she risks the Devil's wrath in order to save Joe Hardy's soul . This is how Gwen Verdon played the role ( on Broadway and in the film ) , but Remick wants to have our sympathy from the beginning . She's awful . Ray Middleton is badly cast as Joe Boyd , the ageing man who sells his soul for one last chance to recapture his youth . Even when this role is played well , it's hard for us to sympathise with Boyd : he abandons his wife for selfish reasons , and gives her no explanation . Middleton spent most of his career playing villains , and his basic coldness makes Joe Boyd even more unsympathetic than usual . Jerry Lanning plays Joe Hardy , the younger " improved " version of Joe Boyd . Lanning sings very well , but he lacks the physique for this role . Joe Hardy is meant to be a physical paragon , literally superhuman . Lanning can't compare to Tab Hunter , who played Joe Hardy in the movie version . Tab Hunter ( with his gimmicky name ) always looked just too good to be true , which turned out to be an asset when he played super-athlete Joe Hardy in the movie " Damn Yankees ! " . Lanning is too " normal " for this superman role . The TV version of " Damn Yankees ! " , with its plodding camera-work , can't match Bob Fosse's brilliant staging of the dance numbers in the film version , but it tries to come up with imaginative visual substitutes . During the song " Two Lost Souls " , while Lanning and Lee Remick do an uninteresting dance , weird splotches of multi-coloured ink are superimposed on the screen in slow motion . This isn't as interesting as a Bob Fosse dance number , but it's an honest attempt to do something original and different . The 1958 " Damn Yankees ! " was the first movie musical with a racially integrated chorus line ; unfortunately , this great idea wasn't repeated in the TV remake . But the movie version also suffers from the presence of Jean Stapleton doing her annoying " dingbat " routine . Stapleton is completely absent from this TV remake , which is one of the reasons why you'll enjoy it . The TV version of " Damn Yankees ! " tries very hard , and much of it succeeds . Some of it is even better than the 1958 film version . I strongly recommend this TV special as an alternative to the enjoyable film version ; each has its own flaws , and each has its merits . And I enjoyed hearing " The Game " , with its hilarious lyrics . Why was this song left out of the movie ?
418806	1609079	372837	10.0	Dirty work at the crossroads .	I've viewed the reconstructed print of ' Curses ! ' . It's a brilliant effort of reconstitution and detective work , a true labour of love . Still , I wish I'd seen an original print of this film , with its original titles . Why ? Because ' Curses ! ' , filmed in 1925 , is a parody of those old-style curses-foiled-again melodramas that were lampooned so brilliantly ( 40 years later ) by Dudley Do-Right and his friends . There's a modern tendency to regard the films of the 1920s as hopelessly old-fashioned and clichéd . But ' Curses ! ' proves that those mossy clichés were already ripe enough to be lampooned in 1925 , which makes me wonder precisely how far back they originated . Al St John ( brilliant ! ) is the Snidely Whiplash-style lip-curling villain who is determined to steal ' the papers ' ( says an intertitle ) from the fair heroine and her elderly father . A handsome swashbuckling hero , who rejoices in the name Rodney Hemingway , is determined to stop him . I regret that I can't identify the actor who plays the hero , whose original billing appears to be lost . He's very nearly as good as St John . At one point , St John calmly ties Rodney to a tree at the bottom of a hill , then gleefully rushes uphill to pester the heroine . No problem : Rodney manfully uproots the tree , then ( still tied to it ) , he calmly trudges uphill , bringing the tree with him ! Of course the villains bring the fair damsel to a sawmill , and tie her to a log on the conveyor belt . ' Now we'll find out what little girls are made of , ' cackles St John gleefully . The only surprise here is that they tie her crosswise , when the cliché leads us to expect her to be tied longitudinally . Rodney Hemingway , of course , shows up in the nick of time . . . and he manages to free her by a genuinely intelligent ploy . SPOILER COMING . After such a great build-up , the payoff gag is weak , so I'll give it away . Hero and heroine confront the defeated villain , demanding that he hand over ' the papers ' . Reluctantly , he concedes . . . and gives them a packet of Rizla cigarette papers ! This is likely to elicit a big laugh from any audience members left over from the last ' Reefer Madness ' matinée . However , the next shot establishes that St John uses the rolling papers for TOBACCO . Sorry if that disappoints anyone . The rebuilt version of ' Curses ! ' is brilliantly funny , and I congratulate the old-time movie lovers who worked so long and hard to fix it up for us . Well done , all ! Ten out of 10 !
419607	1609079	11217	10.0	Conrad Veidt's expressive hands	This film's German title would translate as " Journey in the Night " , but that " night " is metaphoric : it refers to blindness , rather than anything nocturnal . The film's most notable merits are its photography ( by Max Lutze ) , the direction by F . W . Murnau ( a bit lighter than usual from this director ) and a remarkable performance by Conrad Veidt . . . an actor who never fails to impress me , yet who surpasses his own high standards in this drama . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . The first reel of this film plays almost like a comedy . Doctor Eigil Börne is engaged to Lily , until a fateful evening when he attends the music-hall performance of Helene , a vamp who sets her cap for the wealthy and respected physician . Helene performs an erotic dance in a bizarre costume resembling a giant rosebud that conceals the entire upper half of her body . As she dances , the petals fall away to reveal the dancer within . Helene fakes an injury on stage , knowing that the doctor in the audience will come to her aid . Helene seduces the doctor while he examines her feet . ( Sounds good to me . ) Before long , poor Lily is left neglected . The doctor marries Helene and whisks her off to the countryside , where he opens a surgery for the local peasants . So far , the film still has the feel of a comedy . There's a weird sequence in which Helene disguises herself as a peasant woman , then shows up at her husband's surgery . . . pretending to need treatment for an injured foot , and waiting to see how long it takes for him to recognise her . Even though Murnau establishes that this " peasant " woman is really the doctor's wife in disguise , he doesn't seem to trust us to follow the action . While the doctor is examining Helene's foot , Murnau cuts to a big close-up of actress Erna Morena smirking out from within her disguise , to remind us who this woman really is . But now , in a starkly beautiful sequence , we see a dinghy rowing toward the shore , with a tall gaunt figure standing upright between the gunwales . Even in extreme long shot , the silhouette of Conrad Veidt is unmistakable , and even from this great distance he radiates tremendous presence . Still , it makes no sense for him to stand up in the boat . . . and even less sense when we learn that Veidt is playing a blind man . I assumed that Murnau told Veidt to stand up in this shot , so as to give more emphasis to the arrival of his character . . . but later in the film , we see the much less dramatic form of Olaf Fønss ( as Dr . Börne ) standing up in the same boat . Veidt plays a painter ( apparently of landscapes ; we never see his work ) who has gone blind , and who has come to the famous doctor for treatment . Börne performs some unspecified surgery . Veidt recovers his eyesight , with tragic results . . . and then goes blind again . I knew that Veidt was a great actor , yet his performance in this film is a revelation . He stalks through his early scenes without a cane or a guide , yet is entirely believable as a sightless man . The scene in which his sight is restored is a tour de force . Later , the scene in which his blindness returns is another tour de force . Conrad Veidt had the most expressive hands in the history of film acting , and he uses them exquisitely here : probing sightlessly , gesticulating . Although most of " Journey into the Night " is brilliant , there is one unnecessarily ludicrous touch at the end of the film . The very last shot is a close-up of a handwritten letter , authored by the blind artist AFTER his blindness has returned ! How did he manage to write it ? Murnau should have inserted a brief shot of Veidt's blind artist dictating this letter to another person , and then shown us this amanuensis writing down Veidt's words . Despite a few minor flaws , I'll rate " Journey in the Night " a full . It's a splendid example of Murnau's skills , and one of Conrad Veidt's most electrifying performances .
418866	1609079	574	10.0	Pity the poor projectionist !	This afternoon at the Barbican , I attended the UK premiere of the digitally restored ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' , with excellent piano accompaniment by John Sweeney , as part of the opening day's programme for the Silent Film & Live Music Series running through June . It's also part of the London Australian Film Festival , likewise at the Barbican . . . so , I actually ended up attending two film festivals simultaneously ! The restored film is a double-bill with ' The Life Story of John Lee : The Man They Could Not Hang ' . ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' is generally believed to be ( and most likely WAS ) the first feature-length movie ever made , produced in 1906 . Sadly , the past tense is appropriate here , as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments . . . and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes , as a previous IMDb'er has noted . Actually , I've also seen ( in Australia ) another reel of this film : not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen , but rather I've seen ( and touched ) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself , now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration . As a part-time Australian ( born in Scotland , expatriated Down Under as a ' child migrant ' ) , I ought to feel proud that Australia produced the first feature movie . However , quite enough films pre-dating 1906 survive ( from various nations ) to make it clear that a substantial amount of film technique - - the close-up , the dissolve , the cross-cut - - had already evolved before this movie was made . Watching this restoration at the Barbican , it occurred to me that credit for the single biggest innovation in ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' belongs not to the photographer , director , editor or scenarist , but rather to that most unsung of film figures . . . old Smokey , the projectionist . Prior to ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' , films were so short that it was possible to store two or more separate movies on one projection reel . And , each reel being a separate story , the breaks between reels were natural breaks in the narrative . Many early cinemas had only one projector , with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown . However , when ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' was exhibited in its original form in Australia ( and later in other countries ) , the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go , so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels . I wonder how soon film editors began using a reel marker ( traditionally in the frame's upper right-hand corner ) to indicate that a reel was about to end . Despite being largely missing in action , the original ' Story of the Kelly Gang ' is of incalculable historic importance . As for the digital version which I enjoyed today , accompanied by Mr Sweeney's impressive performance on the keyboard , I'll rate it a full . Bonzer , cobbers !
418555	1609079	130802	10.0	Kosher courtroom capers	The hilarious silent-film comedy ' Jewish Prudence ' is fairly easy to obtain in film libraries , but all known English-language prints of this movie have the original title card ' Jewish Prudence ' removed and a new title card spliced in , so that this film is now renamed ' Prudence ' . If you can't locate this very funny movie under its original title , try looking for it under the less offensive ( and less funny ) name ' Prudence ' . The title ' Jewish Prudence ' is of course a pun on ' jurisprudence ' , but it also refers to the character played by silent-movie comedian Max Davidson in his starring films . Davidson , who was indeed Jewish ( and with strongly Semitic features ) , tended to play a stereotypical Jewish character on-screen . This can be unpleasant for modern viewers , but Davidson usually steered clear of the more vicious aspects of a Jewish caricature . His on-screen character tended to be resourceful rather than cunning , frugal rather than an outright money-grubber . Max Davidson reminds me of the English actor Ron Moody , whom he physically resembles : Moody has proudly used his Jewish heritage as a basis for most of his acting roles , yet his portrayals never become offensive . In ' Jewish Prudence ' , written by Stan Laurel and directed by Leo McCarey , Max is a father saddled with three grown children who will never amount to anything . His daughter ( Martha Sleeper ) is bone-idle . Max's older son ( Jesse De Vorska ) is an incompetent schlemiehl whom Max pressures into taking a job as a lorry driver . The younger son ( Johnny Fox ) is an idiot who wants to be a professional Charleston dancer . ( Fair enough : that's how Lord Grade got started . ) A handsome young lawyer ( Gaston Glass ) , newly admitted to the bar , wants to marry Max's daughter , but Max refuses to consent until lawyer Gaston wins his first court case . When Max and his dancing son witness a road accident , Max sees a chance to make some money by persuading Johnny to fake a leg injury . There's an uproariously funny sequence in which Johnny feigns injuries by displaying a false leg while concealing his real leg inside a hollowed-out cushion . Of course , several things go wrong . ( At one point , Johnny's got three legs showing . ) When Max gets a visit from two men who seem to be insurance claims adjusters , Johnny plays his scam for all it's worth . This scene has a very funny payoff . Johnny Fox , who gave an amazing performance as the supernatural visitor in ' One Glorious Day ' , gives a splendidly physical performance here as Max's son . Eugene Palllette , hefting only a fraction of his later girth , is impressive as one of the visitors . Spec O'Donnell , who played Davidson's son in so many of his films , is absent from these proceedings . SPOILERS COMING . Meanwhile , Max brings suit against the driver who supposedly injured Johnny . The lawyer for the defence is none other than Gaston , who humiliates Max and Johnny in court by exposing them ( hilariously ) as liars and frauds . Gaston wins his case and then smoothly claims the right to marry Max's daughter . Max drives away in disgust , but his car is immediately hit by a truck . Gaston eagerly offers to represent Max in a lawsuit against the truckdriver , but the driver turns out to be ( of course ) Max's other son ! ' Jewish Prudence ' is extremely funny ; even more so because ( unlike many other Hal Roach comedies of this period ) it actually has a believable plot . Director Leo McCarey's comic pacing is brisk and excellent . The climactic trial scene in this film must have been good experience for McCarey when he directed Chico Marx's trial in ' Duck Soup ' . However , I was annoyed by one ' impossible ' gag in ' Jewish Prudence ' during the courtroom sequence , when a solemn portrait of George Washington is seen to burst out laughing at Max's pathetic testimony . This sort of gag is acceptable for a totally unrealistic comedian such as Harpo Marx , but it drastically conflicts with the comedic style of Max Davidson , who tended to play very plausible and realistic characters . It's only due to fears of Political Incorrectness that Max Davidson's ( Jewish ) screen characterisation is so seldom available to modern filmgoers . I'll rate this very funny movie .
419617	1609079	260948	10.0	Brilliant , distinctive , utterly original !	Guy Maddin is the most brilliant film-maker working today ! If there's somebody better , that person must be labouring in obscurity . Maddin is strongly influenced by the disciplines of silent film , but his vision is unique , distinctive , and utterly original . ' The Heart of the World ' could easily have been a throwaway film , given the circumstance of its origin . The Toronto Film Festival commissioned Maddin to make a brief film to fill a gap in their programming schedule . A mere time-passer . What Maddin gave them was utterly unexpected . Maddin uses large-grain film stock and Klieg-style lighting techniques to replicate the look of silent film . Maddin's production design ( costumes , makeup , hairstyling ) impeccably recreates the images of that period . It's easy to believe that ' Heart of the World ' is actually compiled from old UFA out-takes , circa 1925 . Only just occasionally does Maddin's grasp on the 1920s show the joins , and then those lapses are probably intentional . ' The Hearts of the World ' depicts the rivalry of two brothers . Nikolai is an idealist engineer . Osip is playing Jesus Christ in a passion play , and seems to have developed a genuine messiah complex . Amusingly , Osip does his Jesus routine whilst toting a cross made from metal girders . . . an Art Deco crucifixion ! The brothers vie for the love of Anna , a beautiful scientist who has built a device which enables her to gaze into the Earth's core , literally the heart of the world . Meanwhile , a bloated plutocrat named Akmatov lusts for Anna . All of this is explained in silent-film titles , in a 1920s typeface that looks vaguely Cyrillic . The actors employ authentic silent-film acting techniques while resisting the temptation to ' guy ' those methods or exaggerate them . The only lapse occurs when Anna suddenly vibrates her eyes back and forth while attempting to choose between the two brothers . This seems to be Maddin's intentional parody of silent-film acting . For the rest of the film , his homage to the past is sincere . I spent a delightful six minutes trying to spot all the references and influences in this movie . Maddin is clearly influenced by ' Metropolis ' ( my favourite film ) , but I also spotted the influences of ' Aelita ' , ' Vampyr ' , ' Potemkin ' and ' Haxan ' in this frenzied melange . This is not to accuse Maddin of plagiarism . He displays his influences openly , using them as a foundation for a vision uniquely his own . It's refreshing to see a 21st-century filmmaker who acknowledges a debt to silent films , in an industry filled with Tarantino wanna-bes and counterfeit Hitchcocks . ' The Heart of the World ' is one of the most distinctive , exciting and exhilarating movies I have ever seen . No doubt of it : I rate this movie , and I look forward to more work by this filmmaker whose work is at once utterly alien yet enticingly accessible .
419129	1609079	148339	10.0	Heckle & Jeckle put on the dog .	' The Intruders ' is an absolute top-notch Heckle and Jeckle cartoon . It actually looks TOO good to be one of their toons . The Paul Terry animation studio was never noted for large budgets nor high production values , and the strength of the Heckle & Jeckle toons was always that they were funny despite their cheapjack appearance . And yet here , surprisingly , there are some elaborately detailed and coloured backgrounds and layouts . The two magpies are once again looking for a place to live . They fly over a swank estate , and decide to move in . But the poolside cabana is also the kennel of the resident security guard : a gruff bulldog . Naturally , he wants to chase the birds out . Mayhem ensues . . . but it's quite funny , and it looks better than usual . One animation sequence in this toon - - of Heckle and Jeckle coming out of a bath-house in swimming cozzies - - was recycled in their later ( and much less impressive ) offering ' Hula Hula Land ' . ' The Intruders ' is funny throughout , but the final gag is absolutely outrageous and hilarious . My rating : .
418266	1609079	152128	10.0	Stanelli honks while Lorenzi harps .	' Radio Parade ' has no plot at all : it's merely a series of music-hall turns . But this film is fascinating as an example of what a trip to a 1930s music hall must have been like . Some of the acts in ' Radio Parade ' are delightful , while others are wretched : this too conveys the true flavour of music-hall entertainment in the days of the Moss Empire . The title of this film reflects the fact that several of these artistes ( particularly Jeanne De Casalis ) were better known for their radio performances than for stage appearances . Indeed , De Casalis's turn in ' Radio Parade ' fails to take advantage of the visual medium , and would have worked better as a radio monologue . Several of the other performers in this pick ' n ' mix make much better use of the visual possibilities . In the early ' 30s , De Casalis was quite popular on the British airwaves as Mrs Feather , a featherbrained character similar to Billie Burke , or Gracie Allen without George Burns's steadying influence . Here , Mrs Feather performs a monologue in the form of a ' phone conversation : an annoying conceit , as she often repeats what the ( unheard ) person at the other end of the line has said so that we'll understand her response . Much more successful here is Florence Desmond , an attractive blonde comedienne whose radio speciality had already become a successful gramophone recording : ' Hollywood Party ' , in which Miss Desmond gave vocal impersonations of several Hollywood ( and British ) film stars . She repeats that skit here , with the movie camera demonstrating her ability to mimic the physical quirks of the actors as well as their vocal crotchets . Miss Desmond is much funnier than Miss De Casalis . Reginald Gardiner supplies an imitation of wallpaper patterns . Mario Lorenzi is a harpist who plays ragtime and jazz : given his choice of instrument , the results are poor . Tex McLeod , a sort of second-team Will Rogers , performs lariat tricks while telling a few jokes . Judging from his accent , he's either a genuine Texan or a very good imitation . Presumably his cowboy routine was a bigger novelty in Britain than it would have been in American vaudeville . The sisters Doris and Elsie Waters are here in their popular radio roles of Gert and Daisy , the two working-class housewives with a penchant for cheeky gossip . The two most unusual turns in ' Radio Parade ' rejoice in the names Stanelli and Stainless Stephen . The single-named Stanelli is a thin crinkle-haired man who trundles onto the stage his ' Hornchestra ' . ( A more accurate name would have been ' Honkestra ' . ) This is an immense juggernaut contraption sprouting a quantity of klaxon horns , each tuned to a different pitch . Stanelli rapidly and loudly honks a melody which is far more coherent ( and funnier ) than anything provided by Mario Lorenzi's harp . Stainless Stephen hailed from Sheffield , the centre of Britain's steel industry , and accordingly he kits himself out in a cozzy that looks suspiciously like fetish gear : a gleaming stainless-steel waistcoat , white bow tie and a bowler with a steel hatband . The stainless one's speciality consists of a monologue in which he speaks the punctuation marks : ' This is Stainless Stephen comma comedian question mark . ' For a wow finish , his waistcoat buttons light up and his bow tie revolves ! As seen here , Stainless Stephen had a slight physical resemblance to Ed Wynn . Off the stage , he worked full-time as a schoolteacher , and so he could only perform during school holidays . It's precisely because several of the acts in ' Radio Parade ' are ludicrous or inept that the entire film captures the flavour of pre-war music-hall so perfectly . ' Radio Parade ' is a vital record of England's equivalent to American vaudeville , and I'll rate this movie . Kindly leave the stage !
418894	1609079	423623	10.0	A show-stopper ! Bravo !	' Broadway : The American Musical ' is a six-part series that's just what it claims to be : a documentary history of the American musical ( although it doesn't start anywhere near the beginning : ' The Black Crook ' in the 1860s ) . The basic structure is chronological , though there are a few odd deviations : ' Bye Bye Birdie ' comes before ' My Fair Lady ' , ' The Pyjama Game ' doesn't show up until the 1980s , and flamboyant showman David Merrick isn't mentioned until the 1990s . Of course , the real fun of a show like this is the chance to see rare clips of performers and obscure shows . Necessarily , documentarian Michael Kantor is limited by the fact that most stage performances were not preserved . We see silent-film footage of Bert Williams while the soundtrack plays one of his gramophone recordings ; the image and soundtrack don't match , because Williams never made a talking movie . Yet , within the available material , Kantor makes some bizarre choices . We see silent footage ( taken with a home-movie camera ) of George M Cohan singing and dancing on Broadway in ' I'd Rather Be Right ' . After a brief tantalising glimpse of this rare footage , Kantor cuts to a long excerpt of James Cagney in the movie ' Yankee Doodle Dandy ' , which we can get at any video shop . We see a brief clip of Bill ' Bojangles ' Robinson doing his famous stair dance . . . but after a few delightful seconds , the documentary cuts to footage of a generic jazz band . We see clips from a couple of MGM movie musicals ( not film versions of stage musicals ) containing songs ABOUT Broadway . I was delighted by one clever sequence : an audio recording of Fred and Adele Astaire singing ' Fascinating Rhythm ' is played over animated cut-outs of the dancing Astaire siblings . Also delightful is new footage of former Ziegfeld chorus girl Doris Eaton , singing and dancing one of her old songs from memory , shortly before her 100th birthday ! We also see rare kinescope footage of some major Broadway musical performances : Gertrude Lawrence from ' The King and I ' , Jill Haworth from the original Broadway cast of ' Cabaret ' , Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison from ' Kiss Me Kate ' . What pleasures ! One non-Broadway clip that I welcomed was a brief sequence of Michael Bennett and Donna McKechnie dancing on a 1964 TV show , long before they collaborated on ' A Chorus Line ' . I was also pleased by home-movie footage of the original staging of ' Porgy and Bess ' , along with new interviews of the performers who played the title roles in that production . Various talking heads weigh in with their opinions . Oddly , this documentary makes no attempt to offer the credentials of these people . John Lahr states that his mother was a Ziegfeld chorus girl , yet never mentions that his father was a major Broadway comedian . George C Wolfe comments on the 1944 production of ' On the Town ' ( which closed long before Wolfe was born ) , yet never mentions that he directed an acclaimed revival of this same show . Betty Comden and Adolph Green were in that original 1944 cast of ' On the Town ' ( in addition to writing the book and lyrics ) , so I was amused here when they sing one of that show's songs . . . and get the words wrong ! Other errors here are less happy . Cole Porter's Broadway musical for Fred Astaire was titled ' The Gay Divorce ' , NOT ' The Gay Divorcée ' ( that was the movie version ) . A narrator mispronounces the name of Cole Porter's home town . Mary Rodgers gets the title wrong for one of her father's songs . ( Maybe because he only wrote the tune , not the words . ) Regrettably , much of this documentary caters for what audiences will find familiar rather than trying to interest them in the unfamilar . We get a clip of the Marx Brothers in the movie version of ' Animal Crackers ' . The Marxes were giants of film comedy , but their importance to Broadway's history is negligible . We are told absolutely nothing about Busby Berkeley's work on Broadway , but we get a clip from one of his Warner Brothers movies about a ' Broadway ' musical that couldn't possibly be staged in a Broadway theatre . And did we need to be told for the 21 , 937th time that Mary Martin was from Weatherford , Texas ? This documentary intelligently reveals how the musical theatre was affected by the arrival of the subway in 1904 , by Prohibition , by World War Two , by the terrorist attacks , and by the arrival of Aids . The most moving sequence here is a tribute to Broadway figures who died of Aids . . . not the obvious big names , but those whom one talking head calls ' the guys in the trenches ' : the talented minor figures who never got their chance at stardom . Less inspiring is a film clip of Gerald Schoenfeld of the Shubert Organisation : his two sound bites about the Times Square district seem to be addressed solely to its viability as real estate . A long tribute to the Disney corporation's efforts on Broadway seems to be intended more as corporate back-scratching than anything else . Fittingly , the series ends with an elaborate tribute to Al Hirschfeld , the caricaturist who documented Broadway's best for more than seven decades ! Despite some nitpicks , I deeply enjoyed this documentary and I learnt quite a bit from it . Anyone who wants to learn about the Great White Way will get a solid grounding in the American theatre's history from these six episodes . And anyone who just wants a good time watching some enjoyable musical numbers will get plenty of that pleasure here . I rate ' Broadway : The American Musical ' a full . Bravo !
418850	1609079	90476	10.0	Brilliant show-business epic	The mini-series ' Lost Empires ' is a brilliant adaptation of J . B . Priestley's novel , extremely faithful to the original text ( even using much of Priestley's dialogue ) yet opening up the material to heighten the contrast between the false world of the British music-hall ( where this story's leading characters spend much of their time ) and the grim reality of life in working-class England in the months leading into the Great War . The opening scene of the first episode sets up the mood perfectly , with a chorus girl in military drag as Tommy Atkins , singing the recruitment song ' We Don't Want to Lose You , But We Think You Ought to Go ' . The title of ' Lost Empires ' is a pun . Explicitly , it refers to the fact that the events of the First World War triggered the deterioration of the British Empire and the decline of Britain's clout as a global power . More subtly , the title refers to the fact that the leading chain of variety theatres in Britain's major cities during the early twentieth century were known as the Empires ( the Bristol Empire , the Glasgow Empire , and so forth ) . Even more subtly , the decline of Britain's variety halls ( paralleling the death of vaudeville in America ) happened at roughly the same time as the decline of Britain as a world power . There are many levels of meaning in Priestley's novel , and this mini-series cleverly depicts them all . Colin Firth is splendid as the callow young Richard Herncastle . It's 1913 : Herncastle has left school and is now seeking a career . Unexpectedly , he gets a job offer from his uncle Nick ( played by the brilliant John Castle ) . Nick is a stage magician who tours the variety halls with an elaborate stage act involving all manner of trick apparatus and stage effects . Nick offers Richard a job , in charge of maintaining the act's equipment and arranging its transport from one theatre to the next . Also , Richard will appear onstage as Richard's assistant , wearing an elaborate Arabian Nights costume and riding a bicycle during a vanishing-trick . As the plot progresses into the events of 1914 , Britain is plunged headlong into the war . . . and Richard must contemplate a vanishing-trick of another sort . Laurence Olivier is prominently featured in ( only ) the first episode of this series as Harry Burrard , a comedian who isn't funny . . . and whose deathly-bad performances are harming the success of every other act on the bill . This series depicts the routine of variety-hall performers with keen accuracy . Because Nick and Richard are on the same bill as Harry , they more or less have to live with him round the clock : he travels with them aboard the same trains from one engagement to the next , and stays in the same theatrical hotels with them . Olivier gives a stand-out performance , as Burrard gradually reveals his paranoia and his increasing mental disturbances . I recall that when ' Lost Empires ' first premiered on television in Britain , several critics made glib comparisons between Olivier's role here and his performance as Archie Rice , the untalented pierside comedian in ' The Entertainer ' . These are two entirely different roles , and Olivier gives one of his finest performances in ' Lost Empires ' . My only complaint about this excellent mini-series is that Olivier's abrupt departure in the first episode skews the dramatic emphasis towards the beginning of this series rather than its final episode . ' Lost Empires ' is a triumph : well-written , well-directed , brilliantly paced and well-acted all round . No question : I rate this series .
419483	1609079	423384	10.0	Omiyo , oh-my-oh ! Action-packed railway drama !	I saw a 101-minute version of this Japanese silent film in October 2005 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Sacile , Italy ; the print was restored ( from a nitrate original ) in 2004 by Professor Yoneo Ota of Osaka's University of Visual Arts . At Sacile , the film was screened with its original Japanese intertitles , but individual attendees had the option of hiring headphones , enabling us to hear real-time English translations spoken by a native Japanese at the rear of the auditorium . I plumped for this option , but I found the headphones uncomfortable and the translator's voice unpleasant , so I only sporadically used the headphones . . . and I can't vouch for the accuracy of the translations . If this review contains any errors , I'm sure my Internet detractors will speak up loud and clear . Shigeru Mori is a handsome young engine-driver , assigned to one of Japan's most important railway lines . While driving an express train packed with commuters , he encounters an unmanned runaway locomotive on the line . Collision is imminent , but Mori has time to dive out of the engine cab and save his own life . Instead , he courageously endangers himself to stop the runaway locomotive . . . thus saving the lives of his hundreds of passengers . Among the grateful passengers is the beautiful Omiyo , who performs with a circus troupe . Time passes , during which Mori receives an award for his valour from the minister of railways ( Takaichi Yamamoto ) . The heroic Mori remains humble , living in a modest flat and remaining on good terms with his landlord ( Shiro Osaki ) and the landlord's young son Shoichi ( Masatoshi Nakamura ) . One dark night , Mori encounters Omiyo again : this time she is at the brink of despair , and on the verge of suicide . Mori invites the destitute woman to move in with him , and one thing leads to another . The hot-tempered manager of the circus has been lusting for Omiyo , even though he's married ; she fled the circus in order to avoid his advances . While Mori is working his shift as an engine-driver , the circus showman arrives at Mori's lodgings and tries to force himself upon Omiyo . Young Shoichi manages to warn Mori . ( Why doesn't the kid call the police ? ) SPOILERS COMING . The film has deftly established that Mori's sense of duty outweighs all his other priorities : he is committed to completing his train run , and cannot desert his post to rescue Omiyo ! If Mori's train does not keep to its schedule , it will conflict with the run of the express train bound for Tokyo . However , during the engine's run , Mori has a strange premonition : the Tokyo express has been caught in a storm . Rounding a curve , Mori discovers that this has happened : the Tokyo express was caught in a landslide ; the passengers are safe , but the rubble is impassable and Mori cannot be expected to complete his run . Abandoning his train , he rushes home . . . to discover the circus manager lying dead , stabbed by Omiyo . Wow ! What a movie ! I had difficulty imagining any other nation's culture coming up with this story . Japanese audiences of the 1920s would absolutely accept that Mori's duty to his employers ( and to the train's passengers ) outranks all his other concerns , and therefore they would respect his decision to remain at his post rather than saving Omiyo . If this movie had been made for American or European audiences , the viewers would naturally expect the engine-driver to desert his post - - jeopardising and inconveniencing thousands of people - - to save the damsel in distress . I normally dislike it when a seemingly paranormal or psychic event occurs late in a movie , as it does here . If the movie hasn't established itself early on as a fantasy or science-fiction story , then the sudden arrival of the supernatural at the story's climax seems too convenient , too contrived . Here again , though , this film works because it's a product of Japan's culture , meant for Japanese audiences : ghosts and other psychic phenomena are more broadly accepted in Japan than in most other cultures , so it's accepted as plausible that Mori ( who hasn't been established as psychic ) would experience a prophetic vision during a moment of stress . Also , the landslide doesn't seem contrived either : Japan had suffered a serious earthquake in 1923 , only a few years before this film's release . The footage of the 1920s Japanese railways utterly fascinated me , and I wish that this movie could be programmed as a double-feature with the similarly-themed Lon Chaney movie ' Thunder ' . ( No , I haven't got a print of that one handy . ) In the central role here as the dutiful Mori , Koji Shima gives a virile and athletic performance . Through most of the film , Hisako Takihara depicts Omiyo as a weak and needful maiden , pliant and submissive , so it's intriguing ( and unexpected ) that she manages to fend off her would-be rapist by herself , with fatal results . I'll rate this thrilling and breath-taking movie . Arigato !
418547	1609079	158910	10.0	Harold Russell applauds	William Wyler was the fourth recipient of the American Film Institute's annual lifetime achievement award . One of the purposes of the award is to generate income for AFI from the broadcasting rights to a televised edition of the AFI tribute . . . so , the award is always given to someone whose name value is likely to generate high TV ratings . The first three recipients were John Ford , James Cagney and Orson Welles . Wyler seems an odd choice to be the next year's guest of honour ( after Welles ) because most filmgoers and TV audiences had never heard of him . Wyler's name on a movie simply doesn't embody a mystique in the way that ' a Hitchcock film ' or ' a Capra film ' or even ' a Preston Sturges film ' does . ( Hitchcock and Capra were later recipients of the AFI honour . ) In fact , William Wyler has directed more Oscar-winning performances than any other director , by a comfortable margin . . . a record which is unlikely ever to be broken , now that the Hollywood studio system has ended . Wyler was beloved and respected within the industry , and his films were ( and are ) well-known and beloved by movie audiences , even if the average movie fan of today has no idea who he was . As usual for the AFI tributes , this evening alternates between film clips from the work of the guest of honour , and testimonials by Hollywood celebrities whose name value will bring in some TV ratings . James Stewart gets a look-in , speaking about Wyler's career in general rather than about the one obscure movie which Stewart and Wyler made together ( ' Thunderbolt ' , a wartime propaganda film ) . Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn both give tributes to Wyler , and we see a clip from ' Roman Holiday ' : the scene in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin , where Peck frightens Hepburn by pretending that La Bocca della Verità ( ' the Mouth of Truth ' ) has bitten off his hand . This scene is a surprising choice to be shown out of context , especially for viewers who have never seen ' Roman Holiday ' in its entirety : we have no advance notice that this movie is a romance or a comedy , so - - when Peck pretends that his hand has been bitten off - - the action is much more startling here than it is in the actual movie . Talking of missing hands : the most moving testimonial of the night comes from Harold Russell , the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role . During the second World War , Russell was an Army sergeant whose hands were blown off whilst he was deactivating a dynamite charge . Wyler cast him in ' The Best Years of Our Lives ' as the homecoming sailor who has lost both hands in action . Russell , with his prosthetic hooks gleaming in the spotlight , gives a heartfelt tribute to Wyler . . . then adds some humour with a personal anecdote about an encounter with a woman who noticed that Russell resembled the hook-handed actor in this movie , and ( failing to realise who he was ) she suggested that he should watch the film as inspiration to overcome his own handicap ! Each AFI tribute ends with the guest of honour mounting the podium and saying a few words . I've observed that William Wyler's name doesn't carry the mystique that so many other directors ' names do . One reason for this may well be that Wyler ( unlike Hitchcock , Capra , Ford , Welles , Preminger , Truffaut and so many others ) was a genuinely modest and self-effacing man . When Wyler was signed to direct the 1959 remake of ' Ben-Hur ' , MGM's publicity department blared that Wyler had been an assistant director on the 1925 silent version . . . until Wyler modestly pointed out that his duties on that earlier film ( with ' assistant director ' as his official title ) had merely been crowd control . Wyler continues that modesty here . He tells the story of how he broke into the film business : with no previous movie experience , he walked into the office of Carl Laemmle ( head of production at Universal ) and demanded a prestigious job . Laemmle was so impressed with this young man ( claims Wyler ) that he was hired straight away as a director . The punchline has Wyler saying : ' Thank you , Uncle Carl ' . Laemmle was notorious for padding the payroll of Universal Studios with his relations and in-laws , to the extent that he was nicknamed ' Uncle Carl ' . . . leading Ogden Nash to compose his couplet : " Uncle Carl Laemmle had a very large faemmle . " In Wyler's case , that nepotism turned out to be a good thing . William Wyler has made many wonderful films , and his AFI award is well-deserved . !
419177	1609079	19074	10.0	Chaney's greatest role .	' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' was Lon Chaney's favourite of his own films , according to Robert Gordon Anderson's 1971 Chaney bio . As Tito Beppi , an Italian clown who adopts a foundling , Lon Chaney pulls the stops out : playing a wide range of emotions , even legitimately over-acting as a circus clown . He also adds an elaborate Auguste-style clown whiteface to his gallery of 1 , 000 faces . And it didn't hurt that ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' had a hit song in 1928 . ( Yes , silent movies sometimes had hit songs : published as song sheets to accompany the film , these were performed by pit musicians in first-run cinemas . ) I screened an acetate print of ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' duplicated from a nitrate vault print missing Reel Four . This explains why Chaney's clown partner ( Bernard Siegel , excellent ! ) walks out of Chaney's life in Reel Three but is back for the climax : their reconciliation is in Reel Four . Also missing is a sequence ( filmed but possibly never used ) in which teenage Loretta Young dons a pageboy's ' Buttons ' uniform . In early scenes with the infant foundling , Lon Chaney portrays a man younger than himself : here his make-up softens his features ; his hair is dyed black and his bald spot is thatched over . The action jumps ahead about 15 years : Chaney appropriately greys and thins his hair , while adding wrinkles . The action moves ahead three more years : Chaney ages more than that in the interim , but his character is under great strain . I had mixed feelings about one sequence : Chaney's character visits a doctor's surgery , complaining of depression . The doctor tells him to attend a performance of the circus clown Flik , whose sawdust antics can cure anyone's melancholy . Chaney sadly replies that this advice cannot help him : he IS Flik ! For me , coming from a background of British and European showbiz , this moment was unimpressive because I recognised its origin : this story was first told about the English clown Joseph Grimaldi ( 1778-1837 ) , and later told about Grock , a Swiss clown who was still performing when ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' was in production : in 1928 , Grock was the world's highest-paid circus performer . ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' is apparently set in the contemporary present : Loretta Young wears some cloche hats and other 1928 fashions , and Nils Asther wears a wristwatch . ( These were considered effeminate until after World War One . ) Chaney often played madmen or characters beyond the brink of madness . In ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' , he plays a man who questions his own sanity , yet he retains our sympathy . In one shot , Chaney's face contorts into rage . . . and for an instant I saw some of his earlier villainous roles . This is possibly Chaney's only misstep in an otherwise note-perfect role that deserved an Academy Award . Loretta Young , barely over age 14 here , is a seasoned pro : winsome in her early scenes as a girl her own age , then becoming a demure young lady in the scenes three years on . Several of Lon Chaney's MGM films ( ' The Big City ' , ' The Black Bird ' and ' While the City Sleeps ' ) cast him as a man with romantic designs on a girl young enough to be his daughter . ( Chaney had no such penchant in real life . ) Here , he raises foundling Loretta from birth , then finds himself wanting to pitch woo to her in her teen years . . . but this time the girl ( by adoption ) really IS his daughter ! This was the only aspect of Chaney's portrayal which I disliked . It's well-known that some silent-film actors ' careers were ruined by the coming of sound . Less well-known is that some directors ' careers suffered as well . Herbert Brenon ( who reportedly bullied Young during this production ) was a major silent-film director whose career plummeted rapidly in talkies . Brenon's films had a slight unreality about them , which worked well in fantasies ( his best-known film is ' Peter Pan ' ) or in dramas with a theatrical background such as ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' . The film benefits from MGM's top production values . Only two details rang false : a nurse in Italy wears an American nurse's uniform , and I have difficulty believing that ( even in 1928 , before mega-tort lawsuits ) a tightrope performer would perform directly above his audience without a safety net . In ' The Black Bird ' , Lon Chaney ( who never visited Britain or Europe ) expertly depicted a thief from London's Limehouse district . Chaney employed the hand gestures and body language of an authentic London costermonger ; I don't know where he observed these gestures ( from an expat in Los Angeles ? ) , but his portrayal convinced me that he was a genuine Londoner . In ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' , playing an Italian peasant , Chaney uses authentic Italian gestures and body language without going into ' mama mia ! ' exaggerations . Bravo , Lon ! SLIGHT SPOILERS . At the climax of ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' there's a brilliantly lyrical image . On the stage of an empty theatre , Chaney's demented clown hears the ( absent ) orchestra , and the audience applauding . This being a silent film , we SEE musicians ' instruments and applauding hands superimposed over Chaney's whiteface Auguste make-up . This beautiful and evocative visual device would have worked just as well in a talkie film , but I suspect that - - if Chaney had lived long enough to film this story as a sound movie - - the image would have been omitted in favour of a straightforward auditory hallucination on the soundtrack . Compare the very similar climactic sequence in ' Stage Door ' ( 1937 ) , where Andrea Leeds plays a deluded actress who imagines herself preparing to go onstage while she commits suicide : in that film , the delusion is confined to the soundtrack , and it's not nearly so effective . As usual , when a silent film and a talkie depict similar events , the silent version does it better . Film is , after all , primarily a visual medium . Despite my nitpicks , ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' is a masterpiece which works even with a reel missing , and Chaney's performance is a triumph : possibly his greatest role , surpassing even the Phantom of the Opera . My rating for ' Laugh , Clown , Laugh ' : a solid .
418843	1609079	861719	10.0	A man in Chorleywood fingers his organ .	' Metro-Land ' is John Betjeman's quiet celebration of the unique and special pleasures of life in one section of England in one segment of the twentieth century . Much of what's seen here was already on its way to extinction when Betjeman extolled it . If you're an Anglophile , or a nostalgic Briton of a certain age , you'll find ' Metro-Land ' utterly fascinating : everyone else should give it a miss . When the Metropolitan Railway constructed its tube line from Baker Street to Amersham during the period from 1910 to 1933 , it enabled the creation of a line of suburbs from land that had been largely undeveloped and underpopulated . Orchards and meadows gave way to houses . Boarding the down train , Betjeman follows the route to its outer terminus . Here are some of the locations and people he encounters along the way : In Neasden , Betjeman meets bird-watcher Eric Sims and follows him on a nature trail through Gladstone Park and the Brook Road allotments . In Wembley Park , Betjeman locates a never-completed replica of the Eiffel Tower , intended for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924 . ( Wembley Stadium is there now ! ) In Harrow-on-the-Hill , long-haired boys in boaters sing the Harrovian song . In Pinner , residents wash their cars while listening to the Osmond Brothers ( ! ) on a transistor radio . In Moor Park , Betjeman visits the links , swings at a golf ball . . . and misses . In Chorleywood , Betjeman visits a man with an immense organ : a Wurlitzer pipe organ , which he keeps in his front room and plays every day . In Amersham , Betjeman indulges his fondness for architecture by visiting the modernist house built by Amyas Connell for Bernard Ashmole . Finally , in the quaint village of Quainton , Betjeman expresses relief that the railway extends only so far , enabling nostalgists like himself to enjoy places still untouched by modern travel . Which is part of the problem : modern technology brings people closer to the old-fashioned way of life while acceleratng the decline of that same phenomenon . Much of what Betjeman celebrates in this 1973 video is already ( as I write this ) long extinct . Doctor Beeching , where are you ? I'll rate this fascinating documentary . . . for Anglophiles only , though .
