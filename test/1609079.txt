418399	1609079	281631	1.0	No Balls , no Bluff : this film is lost .	" Balls Bluff " is a low-budget , amateur short film that merits a small footnote in film history as the first movie written and directed by Robert Downey , Senior . No prints of this movie are known to exist . I have often maintained that no movie should be considered ' lost ' unless it was deliberately destroyed . Many , many films that were officially ' lost forever ' have been rediscovered by diligent searchers . In fact , just last week ( as I write this ) , BBC World Service announced the discovery of a complete print of ' Beyond the Rocks ' , a silent film directed by the very underrated Sam Wood ( apparently not one of his best efforts , but any Sam Wood movie is worthy of attention ) . So , ' Balls Bluff ' may yet turn up . But this seems unlikely . When a lost film is rediscovered , it's usually because at least one release print was never returned to the distributor , and the errant print is found in a private collection or archive . ' Balls Bluff ' was never released or distributed in the first place , so it's highly unlikely that a print will turn up in a forgotten projection booth . I have not seen ' Balls Bluff ' , which probably no longer exists . My review of this film is based on information given to me by two friends of mine : Fred von Bernewitz ( who edited ' Balls Bluff ' but no longer owns a print ) and the late Art d'Lugoff , an impresario who once screened ' Balls Bluff ' in his jazz club in Greenwich Village , NYC . Fred von Bernewitz originally distinguished himself in the 1950s as the compiler of a checklist of art and articles in ' Mad ' magazine . At the time that I write this , Fred von Bernewitz now has a very respectable career as an audio editor . ' Balls Bluff ' is unofficially based on ' An End to Bugling ' , a novel by Edmund G Love , who is better known for writing the book that became the Broadway musical ' Subways Are for Sleeping ' . EG Love was a journalist who , as a publicity stunt , once ate his way through 5 , 000 New York City restaurants . . . in alphabetical order of the restaurants ' names ! ' An End to Bugling ' is his novel about a Confederate Army regiment at the battle of Gettysburg in 1863 who , due to a glitch in Heaven , are sent forward in time to Gettysburg , PA exactly one century later . ( This novel was still being written by EG Love at the time when Downey borrowed its premise for ' Balls Bluff ' . ) ' Balls Bluff ' is the story of one Union Army soldier ( played by director / scripter Downey ) who abruptly finds himself snatched from a Civil War battlefield in 1861 and catapulted 100 years into the future , to Central Park in New York City . Of course , he sees cars and other strange objects . He sees a newspaper headline about Vice President Johnson and he assumes this refers to Andrew Johnson , not Lyndon . He tells a modern onlooker that he's " a Union man " , and of course this is misinterpreted as a reference to trade unions . Eventually , the soldier learns that the Yankees ( baseball team ) are in the Bronx today , so he heads north ( geddit ? ) to rejoin his regiment . Get it ? Yankees ? Union Army ? Civil War ? Bring the jubilee . . . As ' Balls Bluff ' was a very short film , made on a negligible budget , it was probably intended as Downey's ' demo ' film to get him professional assignments . . . and on that level , it certainly succeeded , as Downey went on to a very notable career . By all accounts , ' Balls Bluff ' wasn't very clever or funny , but ( with its short running time and shorter budget ) it didn't really have a chance to do those things . As I've not actually seen ' Bulls Bluff ' , I shan't rate it .
419725	1609079	431591	1.0	Foul ball !	' Abner the Baseball ' is an extremely low-budget cartoon from Paramount , the studio that consistently produced the least entertaining and least imaginative animation . The opening credits of this cartoon ( with a choral theme song ) place so much emphasis on the title character , they make this toon seem intended as the debut of an ongoing series . But this is strictly a one-off , and it's hard to see how it could have been otherwise : Abner is just a talking baseball . . . and he isn't even a talker , so much as a mere narrator . We meet Abner propped upon a pillow in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York . With an annoyingly twee voice emerging from his anthropomorphised face , Abner reveals the events leading up to his arrival in this hallowed hall . It seems that Abner is the baseball that got whacked by Mickey Mantle for a home run against the Detroit Tigers , on 10 September 1960 . . . sailing for an astonishing 634 feet ( 193 metres ) . Abner gets whacked right out of Briggs Stadium and into the street , where he's found by a kid who is honest enough to bring him back to the stadium . Abner's narration tells us that this is the longest home run ever hit . Actually , Mantle had previously hit at least one longer home run , in an exhibition game . We see a cartoon version of Mickey Mantle , although the only part of him that's recognisable is the number 7 on his jersey . The animation here is quite bad even by Paramount's low standard , and repetitive with it . Every single time the catcher signals a pitch , he always gives the two-finger signal . ( My cultural references are British , so I got a big laugh out of this . . . for the wrong reason . ) Each time the pitcher goes into his wind-up , he invariably cocks his leg absolutely straight up into the air . Even a very unsophisticated child who knows nothing about animation cels will notice that the animators are using the same actions over and over in this brief toon . A baseball is not the best possible object for animators to imbue with anthropomorphic existence . Abner is drawn to look like a regulation baseball , but with a human-ish face . ( As if the baseball-headed mascot of the New York Mets got his body chopped off . ) Kids who watch this cartoon might be prompted to wonder how a humanised baseball feels when it gets knocked for a home run , or when it lands in the street outside the stadium . Doesn't this hurt ? Abner never addresses this . Nor are we ever told why this particular baseball is named Abner . The obvious assumption is that this refers to Abner Doubleday . It's now thoroughly discredited that Abner Doubleday invented baseball : this canard was created by an Anglophobe sport-equipment manufacturer who wanted to suppress the fact that America's national pastime was invented in England . Still , the disproven myth refuses to die . When I visited Arlington National Cemetery - - where Doubleday is buried - - I was annoyed that the tour guide kept saying that Doubleday invented baseball ( which he didn't do ) , while mentioning nothing at all about Doubleday's actual achievements as a general in America's Civil War . I'll rate ' Abner the Baseball ' just 1 point in 10 , and that's only because I'm a baseball fan .
418440	1609079	8372	1.0	Lost but no loss , Stan Laurel's bicorn-y debut .	Some footage from ' Nuts in May ' ( 1917 ) - - Stan Laurel's very first movie - - was salvaged five years on and edited into ' Mixed Nuts ' , another of Laurel's pre-Hardy comedies ( from a different production company ) , but ' Nuts in May ' in its original form almost certainly no longer survives . The obscure production company that made ' Mixed Nuts ' obtained clear title to ' Nuts in May ' ( from an even more obscure production company ) , and had no interest in letting any prints of the previous movie compete with their revised version . ' Nuts in May ' was a right one-off : the one and only film ever made by the Bernstein Studio , an independent endeavour which produced and released just this lone one-reeler before going out of business . Sam Bischoff - - the producer of ' Mixed Nuts ' , and a notorious tightwad - - bought ' Nuts in May ' at a bailiff's auction . In the last years of his life , I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock , a Hollywood old-timer who knew Stan Laurel intimately . ( Besides working with Stan Laurel , Rock introduced him to Lois Neilson , and Rock was subsequently best man at their wedding . ) Although Joe Rock didn't work on ' Nuts in May ' , he remembered the film and told me quite a bit about it . This synopsis of ' Nuts in May ' is based on Joe Rock's memories ( still clear as he approached his ninetieth birthday ) and my viewing of ' Mixed Nuts ' . Stan plays a resident of a " Home for the Weak-Minded " , apparently a lunatic asylum . There are several gags depicting the inmates ' bizarre behaviour . Stan's particular delusion is that he thinks he's Napoleon . ( Is there even one genuine case on record of anyone - - besides Bonaparte himself - - actually believing that he or she was Napoleon ? ) Stan walks the grounds of the cuckoo-hatch sticking his right hand into his shirt ( ha ha ) and wearing a Napoleonic hat . ( Memo to IMDb reviewer Bob Lipton : Napoleon's hat was a bicorn , not a tricorn . And how does Mr Lipton know that Stan is wearing a ' blue ' blazer in this monochrome movie ? ) Stan salutes everybody , including the other lunatics . He thinks he's Napoleon , but he gives the salute of the British army . Stan has his own personal keeper in the asylum : a taller moustached man who wears a kepi so that Stan will think he's a French officer . French soldiers ( and gendarmes ) didn't wear kepis until after Napoleon's death . . . but don't mind me ; I just work here . Stan gets out and finds some local boys , who eagerly join him in playing soldier . Stan's kepi-wearing keeper pursues him through the film , but at a lethargic pace . Stan hijacks a steamroller ( when did Napoleon ever drive a steamroller ? ) , and there's some unfunny undercranking as Stan nearly runs down some navvies in a road crew . In the surviving footage , the photography's bad and the pacing is awful . Stan Laurel's performance gives no hint of the brilliance to come . Indeed , right up until his team-up with Oliver Hardy ( apparently Hal Roach's idea ) , Laurel on the screen was just one more frenetic comedian , not necessarily imitating Chaplin but working the same trough of knockabout humour with little or nothing to distinguish him from other slapstickers . Joe Rock did tell me that ' Nuts in May ' was financed by Los Angeles impresario Adolph Ramish , who paid Stan Laurel the astounding wage of $75 to appear in it . Ramish screened ' Nuts in May ' at the L . A . Hippodrome , where it was seen by Carl Laemmle . . . not yet the major producer he would later become . Apparently Laemmle liked ' Nuts in May ' enough to sign Laurel to a contract with Nestor Film Company , one of the lesser satellites in the Universal Studios planetary system . However , from what I've seen of Stan Laurel's time at Universal , his work there was not especially funny . He really didn't come into his own until he arrived at Hal Roach's studio . . . where Laurel distinguished himself as a director and gag man as well as a comedian before teaming with Hardy . Purely for its historic value , it would be nice if a complete print of Stan Laurel's film debut eventually turns up in some forgotten bailiff's locker . However , the photography would be wretched even if the print were pristine . Stan Laurel was brilliant elsewhere , but not in the surviving footage of ' Nuts in May ' . And I'm positive that none of the ' lost ' scenes contain some nugget of hilarity : if something funny had been in there , Sam Bischoff would have included it in ' Mixed Nuts ' . I normally don't rate films I've never seen ( quiet in the back , there ! ) , but I feel confident that ' Nuts in May ' merits just 1 point in 10 , and an asterisk in film history for Stan Laurel paying his dues .
418858	1609079	14583	1.0	Her missionary position .	Robert Hichens was a prolific author who is now almost utterly forgotten except for his ghost story ' How Love Came to Professor Guildea ' , which is widely anthologised . The first time I read that story , it quite bored me . Years later , I read it again and was deeply horrified . ' The Voice from the Minaret ' is a film based on a Hichens novel which I haven't read . This film is a shallow and bathetic soap opera , which impressed me only for some elaborate ( but unconvincing ) sets . Maybe if I wait a few years and see this movie again , it will impress me . . . as Hichens's ghost story did , the second time round . Somehow , I rather doubt it . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . Lady Adrienne Carlyle ( Norma Talmadge ) is the wife of the colonial governor of Bombay , played by Edwin Stevens in Snidely Whiplash mode . When Lady Carlyle learns that her husband is playing footsie with the Countess La Fontaine ( apparently Bombay is knee-deep in bluebloods ) , she hops the next steamship bound for Southampton , intending to get a divorce in England . Aboard ship , she meets handsome Andrew Fabian , and the two of them start knockin ' boots in Lady Carlyle's stateroom . Erm , but it turns out that Fabian is a missionary , bound for Port Said to convert the heathens . No problem : Lady Carlyle jumps ship with him , and the two of them carry on knockin ' boots in Damascus . Presumably in the missionary position . Out of the canebrakes comes a bishop who persuades the two sinners to repent . Lady Carlyle and Fabian , shamefaced , go their separate ways . Then Lord Carlyle conveniently pops his clogs . Happy endings all round , as Lady Carlyle and her preacher-man scurry to the nearest choir loft . . . where they can be married without the stigma of a divorce for Lady Carlyle . What a load of cobblers ! Some of the sets feature some impressive chinoiserie , but I never for an instant believed that these characters were in Bombay , Port Said , aboard an ocean liner , or in any place other than a Hollywood set . Talmadge overacts rather direly , and it's only because Edwin Stevens's histrionics are even worse that Talmadge is acceptable at all . The self-righteous and hypocritical ending doesn't help . I'll rate this movie one point in 10 , purely for the art direction and some decent photography .
418346	1609079	128998	1.0	Bolshevik , Bolshoi , Bullsht !	It's not impossible for propaganda to be artistically successful . Quite a few German movies produced by the Third Reich ( and blatantly pro-Nazi with it ) have entertaining storylines and good performances despite their dreadful political agenda . I've seen a few Soviet movies that succeed as artistic endeavours while promoting communist agitprop : a few , but very few . ' Clown Giorgi ' is not one of those movies . It stinks , comrade . First , I'll give the Russians some credit . In Britain and in America , where Jonathan Winters calls people ' clown ' as a term of abuse , we give very little respect to clowns . . . and very few of our clowns deserve respect . ( In America , clowns are one step above street mimes on the comedy food-chain . ) In Russia , however , clowns are respected craftsmen . . . and they deserve that respect . A typical clown in a Russian circus has spent years of apprenticeship in mastering acrobatics , juggling , animal-training and many demanding physical disciplines . ( I've seen clowns in the Moscow State Circus who are truly astonishing . ) In America , any jerk can be a clown with just some greasepaint and a dodgy wig . ' Clown Giorgi ' takes place in the Ukraine during Russia's civil war of 1918 , and the propaganda is so thick you can cut it with a samovar . The communist Red Army are clearly depicted as the brave heroic good guys . . . peace-loving commies who aren't afraid to die in battle , but who yearn for the war to end so they can go back to their agricultural collectives . The Menshevik forces of the White Army are the deceitful bloodthirsty oppressors . I would have put it just the other way round , but this movie asserts that ' Bolshevik ' ' good ' . The hero of this Russian film is a circus clown , so ( by Russian standards of clowndom ) audiences would perceive him as an admirable and resourceful figure , not a baggy-pants buffoon . In the opening scenes , we briefly see Giorgi doing his circus act . After the October uprising , he's conscripted into a Red Army brigade ; he serves loyally but without distinction as the company clerk . The heavily-bearded brigade commander has been severely wounded in previous battles , but is still determined to fight onward . He needs a brave man to infiltrate the White Army's lines and learn their battle plans . Giorgi's experience as a clown makes him a master of disguise , so he volunteers for the mission . Giorgi succeeds , and gets back to the Red Army encampment just in time to see his bearded commander die selflessly and heroically . Someone must take this fallen hero's place to lead the Red brigade into battle . . . but the soldiers will be demoralised if they learn that their commander has died . BLATANTLY OBVIOUS " SURPRISE " ENDING . Next thing we know , the bearded commander has risen from the dead . . . and he courageously leads his valiant commie brethren into battle against the White Army . Just when the communists win the battle , their commander is shot dead . The corpse turns out to be wearing a false beard . Who can this be ? Giorgi was a master of disguise , da ? Eto pravda ! The brave clown gave his life for the Communist Revolution . I have such utter contempt for communism ( especially the Soviet variety ) that I was tempted to hold my nose with one hand while I cranked this borscht through my Steenbeck viewer . It would take a very , very , VERY loyal Marxist-Leninist to enjoy this movie . I'll rate ' Clown Giorgi ' . Bring back the czar !
418331	1609079	28060	1.0	Unsavoury Savo	I saw this movie in 1974 , at the National Film Theatre in London , and I've absolutely no desire to see it ever again . ONCE in a blue moon is plenty ! In the 1930s , Jimmy Savo was a starring comedian on Broadway . One of Rodgers and Hart's greatest musical comedies , ' The Boys from Syracuse ' , was created as a star vehicle for Savo . He tended to play a chirpy little innocent fellow , fairly similar in appearance and behaviour to Eddie Cantor , Lou Costello or the English comedians Norman Wisdom , George Formby or George Robey . Savo is now utterly forgotten because he made only a few films and no major film appearances . ' Once in a Blue Moon ' is one of the movies made at Paramount's studio in Astoria , N . Y . during the brief period when Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur had absolute autonomy to write , direct and produce their own films . None of the Hecht / MacArthur Astoria films are very good ( possibly excepting ' Crime Without Passion ' ) , but most of them are unusual enough to command interest . ' Once in a Blue Moon ' is painful to watch . Its humour is leaden , its pacing is paralytic , and there are too many sub-Chaplin moments that try to be significant and meaningful . Savo plays a travelling clown named Gabbo ( a name ' borrowed ' from a previous Ben Hecht story ) . Gabbo wanders through Europe with his caravan , searching for audiences whom he can entertain . ( He won't find any here . ) He crosses paths with some Russian nobles who are fleeing the revolution . To escape the Bolsheviks who are pursuing them , the Russians pass themselves off as circus performers and they travel with Gabbo , pretending to be a circus troupe . This isn't funny , or inspiring , or anything else except boring . Some of the dialogue in this film is so incoherent , I thought the sound recording was defective . No ; the soundtrack is fine , but several of the actors are speaking in ( real or faked ) Russian accents which are nearly incomprehensible . Edwina Armstrong , the untalented actress who plays the Russian princess , is Ben Hecht's daughter camouflaged by a stage name . Reportedly , Hecht and MacArthur wasted pots of money on this film , shooting endless retakes of Savo entering a room . Very little of that production budget is visible in this movie . Savo ( an Italian-American ) eventually retired to Italy , where he wrote and illustrated a very dull memoir titled ' Little World , Hello ' . The illustrations in this book ( all self-portraits of Savo ) are very strange : Savo invariably draws his self-portrait in three-quarter view with one empty eye socket , looking as if he had one eye missing . ' Once in a Blue Moon ' rates , at absolute most .
418809	1609079	14405	1.0	The director's wife hanged herself !	Major Rupert Hughes was one of those weird real-life characters whose life story would make an excellent movie . He was an uncle of Howard Hughes , and appears to have acquired some of the same mental disorders as that billionaire . Rupert Hughes dabbled in several art forms - - he wrote a novel , he wrote a book of history , he produced a few films - - but some of those endeavours ( such as this movie ' Reno ' ) appear to be merely soapboxes for Hughes's various bugaboos . Shortly before ' Reno ' was released , Hughes's wife ran off to China and hanged herself . . . and I shouldn't wonder if the timing was no coincidence . This movie is horrible . Ostensibly , ' Reno ' is a drama about the marital travails of Emily Dysart ( Helene Chadwick ) . She has married Roy Tappan ( Lew Cody ) , who is suave and handsome but turns out to be a scoundrel . Fortunately , Tappan divorces her , saving her the trouble of getting her own divorce . Emily marries Walter Heath ( George Walsh ) , rather less handsome than her previous husband but much brawnier and the salt of the earth . Tappan marries Dora Carson ( Carmel Myers ) . Sorted ? Not quite , because Emily's marriage to Tappan produced two children , Paul and Ivy , whom she wants to raise , but Tappan has spitefully retained custody of them . Most of this movie is some weird sort of divorce travelogue . Emily and her new husband proceed to pursue the Tappans all over the eastern United States - - from New York to South Carolina - - trying to find a state where the divorce laws are most congenial for Emily to regain custody of her children . The film takes a didactic tone . For some reason , filmmaker Hughes is clearly outraged that American divorce laws vary from state to state , and this movie is largely a screed against that situation . At one point , the action shifts to Virginia for the sole purpose of informing us that a girl can legally marry at age 12 in that state . ( This is no longer true , but was apparently so in 1923 . ) Hughes doesn't seem to realise - - or perhaps doesn't want to realise - - one blunt fact : each of the states in the USA is an autonomous commonwealth that can write its own laws , so long as none of them are unconstitutional . Eventually , Hughes seems to realise that this movie needs some sort of action climax . So , Emily's new husband chases her old husband out to Yellowstone Park , where they proceed to brawl at the edge of a geyser just before it erupts . Oh , blimey ! Their fight scene is made even more ludicrous because weedy Lew Cody is clearly no match for burly George Walsh , yet Hughes keeps the fight going anyway in an attempt to create some suspense . It's no surprise how the fight ends , but it takes its time getting there . In the role of Emily's brother , a stiff and mannered performance is supplied by one Rush Hughes , stepson of the guy who dealt this mess . Apparently , Rupert Hughes at least had the grace to adopt his wife's children before she hanged himself . I'll rate this bilge just 1 point in 10 .
419548	1609079	37831	1.0	This is definitely a ' Turkey ' .	I find Tex Avery's cartoons hugely variable . His Screwy Squirrel toons are hilarious , and I regret that he made only three of them . His best Warners toons ( ' Thugs with Dirty Mugs ' ) are both innovative and uproariously funny . But his Droopy cartoons just stink , and far too much of his other work is quite dire . ' Jerky Turkey ' just isn't funny at all . Allegedly depicting the voyage of the Pilgrims to Plymouth Rock in the year 1620 - ( ha bloody ha ) , this 1945 toon is firmly stuck in World War Two , with topical references ( such as ' C cards ' ) that will be utterly incomprehensible to modern audiences . The animation is poor to the point of neglect : one long sequence features a protracted pan across a single drawing , with no movement at all . . . which would be acceptable , if something funny was happening . The main character is voiced by Bill Thompson , using the same adenoidal whimper that he had previously used for portraying Wally Wimple in the radio programme ' Fibber McGee and Molly ' and would later use for the unfunny Droopy . I wonder if Avery designed this Pilgrim , who doesn't resemble a typical Avery character . The Pilgrim has an absolutely enormous nose which looks distressing rather than funny . He stalks a turkey ( definitely designed by Preston Blair ) who sounds and acts like Jimmy Durante . . . but who , alas , isn't remotely as funny as the genuine Schnozzola . It doesn't help that the Durante character has a SMALLER nose than the Pilgrim . There's a very weak running gag which has a very weak and obvious pay-off . ( First rule of survival in the cartooniverse : Never trust a bear . ) Tex Avery , I forgive you for this ' Turkey ' because you gave us so many laughs elsewhere . ' Jerky Turkey ' barely merits a rating of .
418953	1609079	333832	1.0	Marjorie Daw as the Golem .	I viewed a very poor print of this very poor film . Marjorie Daw stars as Joan Thayer , a wronged woman - - apparently American - - who somehow ends up in Paris , where she tries to drown her sorrows by jumping off a quay into the river . ( She must be in Seine . ) She's rescued by a handsome Legionnaire ( Warwick Ward ) . They fall in love , but a vamp comes between them , vamping until ready . Clive Brook lurks about the proceedings as a Parisian impresario . Although Marjorie Daw has the lead role in this film , her participation appears to have been minimal . For much of the story , it's bang obvious that some other woman is doubling Daw . When Daw is on screen , she seems distracted . . . as if she's too busy thinking about her next film role to bother playing this one properly . Worse luck : after Ward fishes Daw out of the river , she spends much of this movie wearing a truly grotesque hairstyle that looks like the wig Paul Wegener wore in his role as the Golem . In fact , Daw's leaden performance resembles the Golem too . My rating for this mess : 1 point out of 10 .
418542	1609079	146367	1.0	Did he say ' mer ' or ' merde ' ?	I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention . Apart from his Rayographs ( which he invented by accident , and which are merely direct-contact photo prints ) , his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn . But surely this had to happen eventually , and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit . The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes . " L'Étoile de merde " . . . whoops , " de mer " . . . features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish , which is never explained . Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - - and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies - - but , if that has anything to do with this movie's theme , Ray neglects to say so . I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards , which ( in French ) manage to include rhymes , a pun ( ' Si belle , Cybele ' ) and some portmanteaux . As so often in Ray's work , there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie . Unfortunately , the photography is ( largely ) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her . I'll rate this mess .
419403	1609079	164044	1.0	Soldier boy is a girl , and it gets worse . . .	' Haiducii ' is the centrepiece of a trilogy of Roumanian films directed by Horia Igirosanu , dramatising the struggle of the Roumanian people to overthrow the tyrannical Pharinote : the Greek regents installed by the Holy Roman Empire as rulers of Roumania . The first film in the triptych is ' Iancu Jlanu ' ( 1928 ) ; the conclusion is ' Cioceii ' ( 1931 ) . I saw ' Haiducii ' in July 1996 at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna ; they screened a print with the original intertitles , from Roumania's Arhiva Nationala de Filme . This one movie in the trilogy covers events from 1812 through 1817 , with the revolution of 1821 left for the third film to cover . Much of the action in ' Haiducii ' is seen from the viewpoint of two young Roumanian sisters , Ileana ( Ana Ciobanu ) and Victorita ( Iva Dugan ) . When Ileana is kidnapped by the Pharinote , Victorita disguises herself as a boy and takes the name Mihaita , then tries to rescue her sister by infiltrating the group of soldiers commanded by Mereanu ( Cristache Antoniu ) , a haiduco . Actor Cristian Niculescu is good as Vulpe , a rival haiduco . The Pharinote have seized the inn owned by Tunsu ( portrayed by the one-named actor Titiandrescu ) , and they use this as their headquarters . Tunsu , enraged , joins the struggle to overthrow the regents . Eventually , after fighting alongside the ' boy ' Mihaita , Mereanu discovers that he's actually a girl named Victorita . The two promptly fall in love , not forgetting their struggle for political freedom . Oh , goulash ! I found this movie deeply unsatisfying . Part of the problem is that this is , after all , the middle section of a trilogy . . . so I've come into some material in mid-progress , and other plot points are left hanging for the conclusion . Fair enough , except that this movie is unsatisfying for other reasons as well . I confess that I know absolutely nowt about this chapter in Roumanian history , yet I get a very strong sensation that Ileana and Victorita , as well as several other characters here , are outright fictional characters , or composites at best . I've never objected to the device of placing fictional characters in actual historical events ( I've done this myself , as a novelist ) , but it bothers me very much when the fictional characters start controlling those events , for instance when they're shown here winning battles that actually were won and lost by real-life individuals . This film is made even more ludicrous by the device of Victorita fighting alongside Mereanu whilst disguised as a boy . Mereanu is entirely fooled , which raises questions about his perceptive abilities , and he accepts this ' boy ' as a valid comrade-at-arms . But as soon as Mereanu learns the truth about Victorita , he is attracted to her so quickly that I can't help wondering if he'd had any of those same feelings for her when he thought she was a boy . Normally , when I've seen only a portion of a film , I shan't rate it . In this case , I've seen only one-third of a trilogy . . . but each movie in the trilogy was released separately and was meant to stand on its own merits , so ' Haiducii ' is to some extent a complete and self-contained entity . If the other two instalments are as implausible and chaotic as this one , then all three are very bad indeed . I realise that some Roumanians ( or some people of Roumanian descent ) will be angered that I have so little esteem for a movie about a crucial period in that nation's history . The reason I dislike this movie so much is not due to any antipathy towards the Roumanians , but because this film's Roumanian director has done such a very bad job of dramatising that material . I'll rate ' Haiducii ' just one point in ten .
418857	1609079	19589	2.0	A loose woman in a tight spot .	I'm told that ' The Woman Disputed ' is one of those mongrel films made in two versions - - silent and part-talkie - - for release at a time when talkies were clearly the coming thing , but most cinemas were not yet wired for sound . I've viewed the Library of Congress print , which is silent . With other films from this transition period , it's been my experience that the silent version is usually superior to the talkie version , if only because talking pictures were a new and uncertain experience for all the people involved . Not having seen the talkie version of ' The Woman Disputed ' , I assume that this silent version is the better of the two . . . but it's not very good . ' Boule de Suif ' ( ' Ball of Fat ' ) is a famous story by Guy de Maupassant which has been dramatised many times for stage and screen . This version makes some changes in the characters ' names , nationalities and politics , but still maintains the basic situation . Much of the action in de Maupassant's story takes place during a long coach journey , which is omitted here . The change is not in any way an improvement , and I assume it was done only because of the difficulties of putting a movie camera ( and crew ) into a crowded coach for protracted sequences . The film , which deviates from de Maupassant's original , is as follows : Austria and Russia are at war with each other ( what else is new ? ) , and beautiful Mary Ann Wagner is caught in the middle . To be precise , the commanders of rival forces both have a case of the hots for her . The Russian is Nika ( Nika ? ) Turgenov , extremely well-played by an actor I've never heard of . The Austrian is Paul Hartman , who doesn't seem to realise he shares his name with an American tap-dancer . Shouldn't the Austrian version of his name be ' Hartmann ' ? Another character in this movie who doesn't realise he shares his name with a real-life actor is yclept Otto Kruger . When Mary Ann prefers Paul to Nika , the latter orders his Cossacks to besiege the Austrian town . Meanwhile , some snooty snobs have sneered at Mary Ann for being ( they believe ) a woman of loose morals . These include Father Roche and a couple of young bluebloods . They make it clear that they won't deign to associate with Mary Ann until her morals get tightened . When the count , the countess and the priest try to break the siege , Nika's men capture them and he orders them shot . But then another prisoner is caught : Mary Ann . Aha ! Twirling his moustaches , Nika announces that he will spare Mary Ann and the other prisoners , providing Mary Ann gives him one night of passion . The three snobs , who formerly shunned Mary Ann as a slut , now urge her to give herself to Nika so as to save their skins . If you've read de Maupassant's very well-known story , you know how this movie ends . The exteriors and long shots in this film are quite good . Much less impressive are the interior sequences . There are many , many , many close-ups in this film , and they emphasise the worst excesses of silent-film acting : arching eyebrows , flaring nostrils . I'll just barely rate ' The Woman Disputed ' .
418352	1609079	15030	2.0	Not-so-special " K "	' K the Unknown ' is a faithful adaptation of a novel simply titled ' K ' , by Mary Roberts Rinehart . . . who is now remembered only for her spooky-house thriller ' The Bat ' . The heroine of ' K ' is Sidney Page ( Virginia Valli , very pretty in her stylish bobbed hair and nurse's uniform ) . Sidney lives in her mother's small-town boarding-house while working as a nurse to Doctor Wilson , a playboy who's supposed to be a brilliant surgeon . ( Then why is his surgery in such a small town ? ) A couple of the local louts , skinny George and fat Joe , are always fighting each other over Sidney , but she doesn't much fancy either one of them . The local Mrs Grundy types are perpetually gossiping over Sidney , speculating that she's having an affair with Dr Wilson . ( He's too busy having affairs with every other attractive woman in town . ) There's some blatant symbolism when a shot of the gossiping women dissolves into a shot of some geese , then back again . ( This idea was done better in ' The Music Man ' , with clucking hens . ) Along comes a handsome mysterious stranger , known only as ' K ' . When he moves into Sidney's mother's boarding-house , the local gossip ramps up a notch . Soon , ' K ' is teaching Sidney how to paddle his canoe . ' K ' is clearly a Man with a Secret . . . but , guess what ? When you find out what it is , you won't give a damn . In fact , I stopped giving a damn a lot sooner . I'll rate this movie . I only kept watching because Rinehart was once considered a major novelist .
418646	1609079	6201	2.0	If the camels die , . . . WE die .	Lou Tellegen is a footnote in theatrical history , having played opposite Sarah Bernhardt as her handsome romantic leading man during her last great tour . ( If Tellegen's acting ability had matched his looks , Madame Sarah would certainly not have chosen him ! ) Tellegen's autobiography ' Women Have Been Kind ' is laughably inept and bathetic . Dorothy Parker , writing in ' Vanity Fair ' , famously suggested that the book should be retitled ' Women Have Been Kind . . . of Dumb ' . Groucho Marx claimed that Lou Tellegen was ' a fairy ' , but there's no evidence that Groucho ever met Tellegen . Groucho also claimed that the Marx Brothers performed in vaudeville with Sarah Bernhardt . . . but all records indicate that this never happened . ' The Unknown ' ( the title refers to Tellegen's role ) stars Lou Tellegen as a mysterious and romantic young wanderer named Farquhar who lands up in Algeria , where he joins the Foreign Legion . Farquhar immediately incurs the wrath of the sadistic Captain Destinn , who has him flogged and does other nasty things to him . Conveniently , there just happens to be a beautiful waitress ( Dorothy Davenport ) at the local hotel ; she and Farquhar hit it off instantly . SPOILERS COMING . The romance between Farquhar and his barmaid makes Destinn angrier . He's about to send Farquhar off on an assignment which Destinn knows is really a suicide mission . At the last moment , Destinn discovers by chance that Farquhar is actually an embittered French nobleman , wandering the globe under an assumed identity . ( Yes , he actually CHOSE the name Farquhar ! ) Destinn salutes the blue-blood , tears up Farquhar's induction papers , and sends him on his merry way with Dorothy . Vive la France ! This movie is nonsense , but there are good performances by burly Theodore Roberts ( as Destinn ) and from Tom Forman ( somewhat burly ) and Raymond Hatton ( not nearly so burly ) as a couple of grunts in the Foreign Legion . But this movie is totally implausible without ever becoming funny . I'll rate ' The Unknown ' . This movie was such a flop that its title became available again a few years later , for a completely unrelated Lon Chaney movie . . . and this plotline was remade in 1928 as ' The Foreign Legion ' , with nobody remembering the original version .
419242	1609079	130640	2.0	He's reckless but he won't be wreckless .	There is one action-movie genre which I absolutely despise : the one in which motorists drive irresponsibly and recklessly , at maximum speed with minimum brains , and the audience are expected to cheer them on . In real life , plenty of innocent people have been killed because some idiot with too much testosterone and not enough brain cells got behind a steering wheel . The last thing we need is movies which glorify this behaviour . I collectively call such films ' Scumball Rally ' movies . Having encountered too many movies like this in the 1980s and ' 90s , I was mortified to discover that the genre was already firmly in place in silent films . " The Drivin ' Fool " is one example . Henry Locke is a businessman in San Francisco , who has signed a contract requiring that he deliver a cheque for a large sum to a Wall Street broker by noontime a few days hence . If the cheque is not there to schedule , Locke will lose his business to his rival Howard Grayson . Locke thought he had sufficient time to post the cheque , but one of his assistants ( Richard Browley ) is secretly in Grayson's employ , and delays posting the cheque . Conveniently , there's a nationwide rail stoppage , so the cheque can't be couriered by train . This is the cue for Locke's son Hal to grab the cheque and zoom off cross-country in his racing car , gleefully ignoring petty details like speed limits and stoplights . I find this sort of storytelling hugely irresponsible . We're meant to admire Hal because he's trying to save his father's business , but it's obvious that the character is aroused by speeding ( the movie's titles identify him as ' speed-mad ' ) , and it's also obvious that the people who made this film expect the audience to admire Hal for his speedy habits . As if this weren't bad enough , the movie is also racist . Early in his cross-country motor trip , Hal acquires a Negro sidekick who rejoices in the name Horatio Jackson Lee , whom Hal promptly dubs ' Cupid ' . Horatio - - played by a black man named Jesse Aldrich , who is clearly no actor - - indulges in plenty of ' yassuh ' dialogue ( supplied by the title cards ) , and some racial humour based on stereotypes of black people as cowardly or stupid . The actress Patsy Ruth Miller never greatly appealed to me . She was pretty and had some talent , but neither her looks nor her acting abilities were above the usual . She made precisely one major film - - ' The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' - - but that film's successes owe very little to her performance . However , I met Ms Miller at Film Forum in NYC on the night of a screening of ' So This Is Paris ' , one of her movies . She generously consented to an interview , and spoke warmly to me of many people with whom she worked in silent-era Hollywood . My fond memories of that evening have prompted me to seek out as many of Patsy Ruth Miller's films as possible : regrettably , few of them seem to be very good . In " The Drivin ' Fool " , Patsy Ruth Miller plays the feminine love interest , but most of her scenes are at the beginning and the end of the film . After the contrived set-up to explain why the cheque can't be sent by post or by rail , the bulk of the movie is occupied with Wally Van's reckless driving and Jesse Aldrich's minstrel-show behaviour . The film's direction is weak , with some poor shot-matching . Sadly , I rate this movie only 2 points in 10 , and I'm being generous .
419702	1609079	18431	2.0	Bubble and squeak .	I saw ' South Sea Bubble ' at Cinefest 2006 , in Liverpool , New York . The American audience clearly disliked this stiff-upper-lip film , not so much because of its extreme Britishness as down to its extreme badness . There was a great deal of shifting and squirming in the audience round me while I was trying to concentrate on this film's story , and more than a few audible comments from the row in front of me . I would have had trouble following this movie anyway ; it's quite dull , and appears to have been badly edited . Ivor Novello is now almost totally forgotten , but in his day he was a major figure of the London theatre . He was , in fact , pretty much the nearest thing to Noel Coward before Noel Coward came along . Like Sir Noel , Novello was a languid handsome lounge lizard who starred in brittle drawing-room comedies ( which he wrote ) and musicals ( for which he wrote the scripts , music , and lyrics as well as directing ) . Novello's autobiography ' I'm on a See-Saw ' ( also the title of one of his most popular songs ) gives an interesting view of the London theatre in Novello's heyday . Like Oscar Wilde , Ivor Novello's health and career were broken by a prison sentence . . . although not for the same offence . During the Second World War , Novello was found to be guilty of petrol hoarding . Quite a few other Britons were guilty of this too , so the Home Office decided to make an example of Novello . He was given a stiff prison term . It broke his spirit and his health , and he died soon afterward . As his films tended to be far less successful than his stage performances , Novello is now sadly forgotten . Anyroad , here we have the unfortunately-named ' South Sea Bubble ' . Basically , a stock troupe of various character archetypes go off into the South Pacific in search of . . . Rodgers & Hammerstein ? Oh , if only ! No , they go poncing off in search of buried treasure . At least two of the characters in this movie seemed to be genuinely insane , whereas the rest merely behave illogically . Benita Hume , as the heroine and love interest , is mannered and unattractive with it . Ivor Novello , as the hero and romantic lead , is woefully miscast . Novello is meant to be playing an adventurer in the tradition of Allan Quartermaine or Indiana Jones : a rugged two-fisted hero . Oh , dear . I've already compared Novello to Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde , so that gives you some notion of how two-fisted he is . He's not even one-quarter of Quartermaine . It doesn't help that these people are allegedly in the steaming tropics of New Guinea , but none of them show any sort of sunburn nor perspiration . ( And their shadows are wrong , too . ) However , that's all right , as ' South Sea Bubble ' was clearly filmed on the Sussex Downs , and doesn't look very tropical with it . Not for one instant did these actors convince me that they were playing real human beings in a plausible situation . ' Old Mother Riley's Jungle Treasure ' did a better job of it with this material . I'll rate this mess just . Maybe this movie is the real reason why Ivor Novello got that stiff prison sentence .
419347	1609079	135522	2.0	Half-baked doughboys	' French Leave ' has enough good laughs to fill a one-reel comedy short ; unfortunately , those laughs are spread out over six reels of tedium . IMDb's cast list has got Al Cooke and Kit Guard credited ( ? ) as playing ' themselves ' . That's not quite accurate . In the same way that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy played two stumblebums named Stan and Ollie who did not resemble their real-life selves , Cooke and Guard are cast here as two idiots named Al and Kit , whom - - I sincerely hope - - are fictional characters , not self-portraits . I well and truly dislike it when actors play characters with the same names as themselves . In this case , ' Kit ' was an extremely uncommon name in 1927 , so - - when a man named Kit plays a man named Kit - - everything is more self-conscious and ' meta ' than it needs to be . Right , here goes . Al and Kit are doughboys from the town of Pratt Falls . . . and that's the funniest joke in the movie . They're in Paris on Armistice Day , where some contrived events lead them to believe they've accidentally killed a man . Do they go to the police and straighten it out ? Of course not ! So , when the gendarmes start chasing them , Al and Kit naturally go on the lam . We know ( but they don't ) that the French government intend to honour Al and Kit for their bravery in combat . . . and the police only want to escort them to the award ceremony . This briefly amusing movie is infuriatingly unfunny . True humour arises when a protagonist is in genuine trouble , preferably physical danger . ( Think of Harold Lloyd , dangling from that clock . ) In this case , Al and Kit think they're in trouble but we know they aren't . There's no build-up , no suspense , because we know that the misunderstanding will eventually sort itself out . Remarkably , the screenwriters manage to magnify the misunderstanding into a climax , when the two legionnaires are ' caught ' by the flics and escorted to the awards ceremony . We know that these two idiots are about to get a gong , but they think they're for the chop . Their distress is only mildly amusing . Now , if it were just the other way round - - the two of them are eager to accept medals , unaware that they're actually heading for the guillotine - - it would have been hilarious . Louise Lorraine and Virginia Sale have little to do as a couple of mam'selles . The funniest performance in this film is given by 8-foot-tall John Aasen , cast as a Legionnaire named Shorty . . . who accidentally smashes everything he touches , due to his immense bulk . ( Aasen was famously the giant in Lloyd's film ' Why Worry ? ' . ) Most of the furniture and props destroyed by Aasen in ' French Leave ' are obviously ' breakaway ' fakes , and yet the huge Aasen brings a genuine note of pathos to his slapstick performance : he really was an immense and enormous man , and watching him here we can't help wondering about the genuine plight of a real-life giant . Watching this pathetic movie spawned by Joe Kennedy's FBO studio , I was shocked that the grossly unfunny intertitles are credited to Jack Conway . There was an excellent director of that name at MGM at this time ; was he possibly moonlighting for Joe Kennedy ? I was relieved to learn that they're two entirely different Jack Conways . I'll rate John Aasen for his splendid performance , but ' Legionnaires in Paris ' just barely rates . Au suivant !
419165	1609079	20848	2.0	Beryl Mercer gets steadily worser	The beloved character actor James Gleason had a second career as a playwright ; he starred in several of his own plays on Broadway before becoming a film actor . One of Gleason's plays , the farce ' Is Zat So ? ' was a huge box-office hit : if Gleason had carefully invested his royalties from this one play , he might never have had to work again . But he squandered the profits , eventually giving up on writing altogether and concentrating his talents on a long series of memorable roles as a film actor . ' Dumbbells in Ermine ' was co-written by James Gleason , but so far as I can tell it's not based on any of his playscripts : he appears to have adapted a play written by other hands . He's also good in a supporting role here as Mike , the brassy trainer of Jerry Malone , the film's prizefighter hero . Robert Armstrong plays the fighter , giving a performance very similar to the one he gave as a broken-nosed boxer in ' Be Yourself ' . He falls in love with the well-bred Faith Corey ( Barbara Kent ) , but Faith's extremely religious parents are preparing her for missionary work in the Congo . SPOILERS COMING SOON . None of the characters in this movie are especially interesting , and there are too many subplots . In this movie , all the subplots are neatly tied up and solved by Faith's kindly old grandmother . . . which is implausible enough by itself , but made much worse by the fact that the granny is played by Beryl Mercer . The late film historian William K . Everson once agreed with me that Beryl Mercer was the single most annoying performer in the entire history of Hollywood movies . ( We also agreed that Sterling Holloway and Chester Clute were tied for second place . ) This so-called actress , this baggage of whines is totally unbelievable as the font of all maternal wisdom , which is how she's cast in this movie . Mercer is painful enough in small supporting roles with only a few lines of dialogue : here , she plays one of the main roles , with a disproportionate amount of the movie's dialogue , and her whining voice is more excruciating than usual . Even Andy Devine's voice sounds more pleasant than Beryl Mercer's . I'll rate ' Dumbbells in Ermine ' ( with its almost totally irrelevant title ) . James Gleason was probably right to phase out his scriptwriting career in favour of his superb performances as an actor .
419318	1609079	26724	2.0	Defective detective , no noir	The chief appeal of ' Mister Dynamite ' is that it's based on a story by Dashiell Hammett , whose detective stories tended to be realistic because Hammett drew upon his own experiences as a private eye for the Pinkerton agency . So , that's one point in this movie's favour . Another good point is that ' Mister Dynamite ' takes place in San Francisco , a city that Hammett knew well and which he evoked very compellingly in much of his fiction . . . most notably in ' The Maltese Falcon ' . Unfortunately , this low-budget movie doesn't come nearly to the level of that great novel nor the John Huston movie it inspired . This movie isn't even as good as Hammett's detective yarns about the Continental Op . It's all by-the-numbers . If there's a dead body or some fisticuffs every fifteen minutes , the audience aren't expected to mind that the story isn't very plausible . Edmund Lowe ( whose career was by now in the downhill phase ) plays San Francisco ' tec T . N . Thompson , nicknamed ' Mr Dynamite ' . He's meant to be the hero of this thick-ear , but he's totally immoral . Private eye Thompson has a bitter rivalry with the police , to the point where he steals evidence from crime scenes so the police can't solve the crimes ahead of him . He also buys luxury items for his girlfriend , billing these to his clients as expenses . We're supposed to like this guy . So far we've got two different clichés here , neither of them very plausible . I can understand why a private detective might dislike the police , but I get annoyed at how often fictional private eyes make a point of baiting and antagonising the police force . ( This was also done in ' Chinatown ' , a film which I found hugely implausible and vastly overrated . ) Private detectives are licensed by the police and are required to cooperate with local police . In real life , if a private eye got one-tenth as sarcastic to a police officer as Jake Gittes and T . N . Thompson do in these implausible movies , his livelihood would get yanked out from under him toot-sweet . As for the second cliché : I find it even less plausible that T . N . Thompson has got a steady supply of clients who are rich enough and stupid enough for him to be able to mulct them so thoroughly with none of them ever tipping wise . But , that's just me . Anyway , a gambler gets bumped off , and Thompson vows to crack the case ahead of the flatfoots . ( Flatfeet ? ) Then a concert pianist gets plugged in his crescendo . The latter is played by Victor Varconi , hissable as usual . Most of the dialogue in this bad B-movie sounds like bad B-movie dialogue , but it never quite reaches the level of enjoyable cheesiness that really ' good ' bad B-movie dialogue possesses . Matt McHugh provides a few pleasant moments as a Brooklyn wiseacre . Nenette Lafayette , who spent her entire film career playing French maids , shows up here as ( wait for it ) a French maid . Jean Dixon gets in a few good lines as Thompson's wisecracking assistant . Dixon had an impressive career on Broadway , playing world-weary dames , yet she never quite caught on in movies . . . possibly because several other actresses ( Glenda Farrell , Marjorie Rambeau ) were already established in similar roles . What I really dislike about ' Mister Dynamite ' is that it reminds me of twenty other ( better ) movies , without ever reminding me of why I liked those movies . ' Mister Dynamite ' seems to have been assembled from the out-takes of several other private-eye flicks . . . and there's no noir to be seen . There's not much bang in ' Mr Dynamite ' , and I'll rate this movie .
418565	1609079	193620	2.0	I'll bet Hitler loved this movie .	I saw this German documentary in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone , Italy . The festival screened a print from a German collection ( the FW Murnau archive in Wiesbaden ) that had English intertitles . According to the programme notes at Pordenone , in 1925 the failing German economy had forced a major decline in feature-film production ( I hadn't noticed ) , and an attendant increase in documentary movies ( again , I hadn't noticed ) , which were cheaper to produce . The programme notes also stated that this film was so popular upon its original release that it was re-released a year later in a new edition , with substantial new footage added and previous footage removed . I'm a bit surprised that it survived at all in its original version . ' The Way to Strength and Health : a film of modern body culture ' is very much an artefact of the Naturist fad that swept Germany at this time . It was part of the same trend which helped the Nazis come to power , with their obsession for racial and physical purity and the beauty of the German countryside . This isn't a Nazi movie , but it comes directly out of the same school of thought which facilitated the rise of Nazism . There's lots of footage of naked young bodies here , most of them German or at least ( by Nazi definition ) Aryan . I felt very uncomfortable watching these sequences , because I felt that they were somewhat dishonest . Audiences for this 1925 movie were fully-dressed and anonymous in the darkness , while watching adults ( and teens ) of both sexes who are naked , performing gymnastics and other physical rituals . I couldn't help wondering how much of this movie's original success was down to sexual prurience and voyeurism rather than a sincere interest in health and fitness . Lest I seem hypocritical , I freely admit that I felt very aroused indeed at the footage of the very sexy young Leni Riefenstahl in this movie . At this late date , this movie's prime interest is historical . If you're interested in seeing naked bodies - - female or male , or both - - you can see far more attractive nudity on offer in other films . I'll rate this one just .
419569	1609079	1198516	3.0	Don Knotts is Andy Griffith's wife ; Jim Nabors is their son !	Since this one-off TV special teams Andy Griffith , Don Knotts and Jim Nabors , you would be justified in assuming that they appear here as their Mayberry characters : Sheriff Andy , deputy Barney and grease-monkey Gomer ( who left the lube rack to join the Marines ) . You would be justified , but you would be mistaken . This is an interesting attempt to give three familiar performers a chance to demonstrate their acting abilities in roles outside their usual range . . . though still firmly within the bounds of comedy , of course . No dramatics here . Basically , this special is a bunch of unrelated skits , with no recurring characters . One skit , early on , is astonishingly similar to a couple of the later but more famous sketches by Monty Python's Flying Circus : the notorious dead-parrot sketch , and ( even more so ) the cheese-shop sketch . Don Knotts plays the feckless customer who wanders into the General Lee Dry Goods Store , run by Griffith . It got that name because , whatever the customer wants , " we General Lee don't have it " , Griffith explains smarmily . Anyone who saw " A Face in the Crowd " is aware of how effective good ol ' Andy can be at playing sleazeballs . He's very good here , but the sketch isn't funny . Still , it eerily prefigures Monty Python's cheese-shop sketch : Griffith seems to be maintaining a shop for the express purpose of not selling anything . The climactic sketch here is deeply weird : a family picnic , starring Griffith and Knotts as husband and wife ( ! ) and Nabors as their bratty little son , who seems to be about eight years old . Knotts , in elaborate female disguise , is actually far more convincing here as a woman than Nabors is as an underage boy . Unfortunately , the material isn't funny : husband Andy Griffith and wife Knotts ( Donna ? ) get into an argument over the fact that she's older than he is ( they agree that she's older , but disagree about how many years ) , while " Junior " Nabors keeps trying to show them the various dead skunks and other roadkill he keeps finding . Since each of these three performers was hugely successful playing one particular character ( well , maybe two in Griffith's case ) , and since the teaming of the three of them here was certain to remind audiences of those three Mayberry characters , I felt that they deserve some credit for attempting to expand their range here . Unfortunately , the script material is fatally unfunny . You'll get a few seconds of shock value from seeing Knotts as a passable woman and Nabors as a ( not so passable ) little boy , and a few more seconds ' shock value from realising how closely the Monty Python cheese-shop sketch ( written after this special first aired ) resembles the General Lee sketch performed here . That's about all you'll get , though . My rating for this one : a mere . These fellers did better work elsewhere .
418954	1609079	15184	3.0	The mortgage on the old homestead	I'm not a huge fan of cowboy movies . . . and if more cowboy movies were like this one , I wouldn't like them at all . Buck Jones ( billed here as Charles Jones ) gives a good performance , but he plays a hugely implausible character . Jack Mills ( Jones ) and his buddy Loupel ( also cried Jack , but nicknamed " Bud " ) are both in love with Jean Ross ( played by the dull Betty Bouton ) . Confronted with a pair of Jacks , Jean chooses Bud . Jack loves Jean so much that her happiness is more important to him than his own , so he chivalrously stands aside . Bud and Jean get a humble homestead and settle into housekeeping , but they soon have trouble paying the mortgage , which is held by a banker named Rand . The title cards cry him " Banker Rand " as if ' Banker ' was his name . For the sake of the young married couple - - really for Jean's sake - - Jack stages a hold-up to kill the banker . Jack is duly charged for the crime . But now , get this : Jack's buddy Bud can be just as self-effacing as Jack , and Bud gallantly takes the blame for Jack's crime . SPOILERS NOW . Bud dies , leaving his wife a widow with their young son Jack Junior . So , with Bud taking the rap for Jack's crime ( which he committed for Jean's sake ) , Jack marries Jean and adopts her son as his own . Goldang it ! I guess there's some sort of Code of the West that makes this stuff plausible to somebody out there . I give a lot of credit to Buck Jones because he was a hero in real life : he died rescuing other people from a nightclub fire . But this movie is just cowpoke nonsense , and I'll rate it only .
418286	1609079	142972	3.0	Combustible flapjacks .	' Wandering Papas ' is the barely-relevant title of this comedy starring Clyde Cook . A former vaudeville performer ( as ' the Kangaroo Boy ' ) , Cook's dazzling acrobatic abilities could have made him the equal of Lupino Lane , Al St John and even ( as an acrobat , at least ) the great Buster Keaton . In ' Wandering Papas ' , annoyingly , he's given no chance to display those talents apart from a brief sequence in which he hops about like a rabbit . At the climax , there's an unfunny ' impossible ' gag when Cook runs in midair ( held aloft by a piano wire ) . Most of the slapstick on offer here could have been performed by Cook's fellow Australians , Snub Pollard or Billy Bevan , without relying on Cook's athletic virtuosity . At several points in ' Wandering Papas ' , Cook seems to be imitating Chaplin rather than developing his own character . During his brief career as the star of comedy shorts , Cook usually - - as he does here - - wore an over-sized brush moustache which I find annoying to look at rather than funny , due to its extreme and intentional asymmetry . The location is a work camp in the wilderness ' where men are men and women are scarce ' . The only woman hereabouts is pretty actress Sue O'Neill . Astoundingly , a title card introduces her as Sue " Bugs " O'Neil . Was this some sort of in-joke ? There's nothing " bugs " about her performance here . Elsewhere , the local dog is oddly cried Rosemary . Sue is the daughter of the Mad Hermit , who can't remember what he's mad about . Clyde ( Cook by name , and cook by nature ) is the chef for the labourers , who are tired of beans and want him to stravage up some gourmet cuisine . The leader of the work gang is played by Oliver Hardy , who's quite good here . . . yet not very funny because he's given so little material . But he has one moment of impressively subtle acting during the breakfast sequence , as he mutely pleads for cook Cook to give him an extra portion of flapjacks . When one explodes in his face , Hardy's deadpan ' take ' is priceless . SPOILERS COMING . Much of the ( fairly indifferent ) comedy occurs at the climax , when Cook and the hermit are trapped in a cabin that's teetering off a cliff . Say , didn't Chaplin and Mack Swain do this scene a year earlier , in ' The Gold Rush ' ? Director Stan Laurel stages the sequence well , with an intriguing angle shot of Cook sliding downhill away from the camera . . . but , well , Chaplin should have sued . When the hermit eventually falls , he plunges into deep water that simply wasn't there in the previous overhead shots . Clyde Cook kindly granted me an interview about a year before his death ; I deeply wanted to like this movie , but it's not very funny . The same talents and the same budget could easily have made a much funnier film than ' Wandering Papas ' . Good job Stan Laurel gave up directing to concentrate on gag construction and performing . I'll rate this one barely . . . and one point is solely for Hardy's reaction to that exploding flapjack .
419096	1609079	15027	3.0	Turgid mellerdrammer from a mail-order school .	Turner Entertainment have a print of ' Judgment of the Storm ' , but this movie's gestation is far more interesting than the movie itself . By the 1920s , movies were big business , and many Americans believed there was big money in writing screenplays ! Several mail-order companies made considerable money catering for this delusion , selling screenplay-writing correspondence courses . One such company , the Palmer Photoplay School , whose bursar was apparently embarrassed that none of his alumni had achieved wealth as screenwriters , proceeded to bankroll a film based on a script treatment by one of their own students : one Ethel Styles Middleton . Amazingly , this movie also spawned a novelisation published by Grosset & Dunlap , written by one Roy Mason . ( A real author , or a house pseudonym ? ) What a turgid melodrama ! The story is set in Darienne , a college town which ( as a shot of a railway timetable informs us ) is 49 minutes by rail from New York City . Of course , all we ever see of academic activity is a brief glimpse of the football gridiron . Hard-working ploughboy Dave Heath ( Bruce Gordon ) is the sole support of his widdered mother and four siblings , but his spoilt brother Bob doesn't care that Dave works like a slave . The two youngest Heaths are insufferable twins Paul and Patsy , who speak their dialogue in twee intertitles . Paul is played by young Frankie Darro , the real-life son of circus performers . In this movie's first reel , we see Darro perform a spinning headstand : he later performed this same stunt in the last reel of ' Wild Boys of the Road ' , but here he does it while balanced on a ledge . The family's dimpled ingenue is sweet Mary , who's in love with campus hero John Trevor ( Lloyd Hughes ) , whose wealthy widowed mother has been away in Europe these past three years . Erm , not quite : actually , Helene Trevor is half-owner of a " Temple of Chance " . . . an illegal gambling den . The dialogue is careful to establish that Helene doesn't WANT to be a crook : she inherited the business from her late husband , but she " loathes " it and wants to get out . Still , she uses the money to put John through college . The viper in this brew is rich boy Martin Freeland , who could attend Harvard or Yale but who allegedly attends Darienne solely to be near Mary Heath ! Sorry , but actress Lucille Ricksen quite fails to radiate any appeal strong enough to make this plausible , and Mary clearly doesn't fancy Martin . She has eyes only for John , who doesn't suspect how his mama makes her moolah . When Martin learns the truth , he arranges for John to meet Mrs Trevor in her den of iniquity , in a sequence that reminded me of the similar meeting in " East of Eden " . SPOILERS NOW . Anna Q . Nilsson , in a small role as a casino vamp , triggers a fight causing John accidentally to kill Dave . Awash in remorse , John abandons his own life's plans to take Dave's place and support the Heaths . There's lots of fist-to-forehead histrionics here , and overwrought title cards : " Will sorrow give Dave back to us ? Will it harvest the grain - - will it feed the children ? " In his death scene , actor Bruce Gordon can't simply die : he has to do an entire " I'm shot ! " swooning routine . Later , Helene Trevor saves the lives of Bob and the twee twins , believing that she has doomed herself in the bargain . Her intertitles fairly drip with lavender and old lace : " Tell their mother - - I send her three - - for the one I took . " Not half ! It's a shame that Lloyd Hughes is now remembered solely for ' The Lost World ' and ' The Mysterious Island ' , in which he was upstaged by , respectively , a brontosaurus and a race of underwater midgets . Hughes was occasionally a good actor ( as in ' Hail the Woman ' ) , but in ' Judgment of the Storm ' he gets caught up in the orgy of overacting . My rating for this turgid bathos is only , mostly for the art direction .
419358	1609079	14652	3.0	flying McGuffins	' Air Hawk ' is a stunt film , in which the plot exists largely as an excuse for the stunt sequences . Fortunately , the stunts are enjoyable enough to justify this structure . ' Air Hawk ' looks and plays a lot like those feature-length assemblages of movie serials . CONTAINS SPOILERS . Al Wilson stars as Al Parker , alias the Air Hawk , who appears to be some sort of airborne private eye . ( This movie has the weak logic of serials , too . ) He's on the trail of Robert McLeod and his gang of thieves , who are plundering a platinum mine . When John Ames , the mine foreman , tries to stop McLeod's men , they kill him . Ames's beautiful daughter Edith tries to keep the mine going in his stead . ( Surely a mine foreman is merely an employee , with no personal stake in the enterprise ? ) Parker and Edith fall in love , but happiness cannot be theirs until the final reel . Meanwhile , the crooks kidnap Edith , and Parker has a fistfight with McLeod up in the clouds , on the wing of an old-fashioned aeroplane . And of course , Parker solves the murder . As I said , this whole movie exists just for the stunt sequences , which are well done , but the story feels like just a bunch of stunts strung together . A few witty intertitles are credited to Della M King , whom IMDb credit as the film editor . The decision to make the McGuffin a platinum mine , rather than a gold or silver mine , is interesting but ultimately irrelevant . I'll rate this movie .
419532	1609079	18410	3.0	What the hell is THIS ?	This is one of the weirder films I've ever seen . Even the title is odd . I viewed a print in which the opening credits show the title as ' 6 - x 11 ' - - with a case fraction , which is not how I've typed it here - - yet for some reason IMDb have spelt out the title in words . Anyway , the title refers to the print format of a photograph . The photograph is crucial to the plot , but the size of the photo is irrelevant , so my guess is that the Epstein siblings ( director Jean , scriptwriter Marie ) just chose that title as an attention-getting gimmick . The last thing this movie needed was one more attention-getting gimmick . SPOILERS COMING . The story itself is very straightforward : so simple , in fact , that it could have been staged as a ballet or a dumb-show with no dialogue whatever . A handsome and sensitive young man falls in love with a beautiful dancer . She betrays him , so he commits suicide . . . which , in this movie's atmosphere , seems to be the most logical course for him to take . The dancer blithely moves onward to her next victim . . . a slightly less handsome doctor . Neither of them knows that the doctor is the suicide's brother . But then the doctor finds a photo ( guess what size it is ) among his brother's effects . The piccie shows the dancer , so at once the doctor twigs the lot . There's a tragic ending , but none of these characters seem to deserve a happy ending . This movie is filmed in a very stark mise-en-scene , rather like a minimalist version of that great German expressionist film ' The Cabinet of Dr Caligari ' . Unfortunately , the actors in this French silent employ very stylised acting techniques , almost as if they were intentionally evoking the modern perception of silent-film acting as overripe histrionics . That decision just doesn't work at all . You can make a film with stylised sets and stylised lighting - - as was done here , and as was done brilliantly in ' Caligari ' - - because the audience will realise that these were intentional choices , even if they were choices mandated by budget restrictions . But it's extremely risky to have film actors use stylised acting techniques - - as is done in this French film , but was NOT done in ' Caligari ' - - because the audience will assume that the actors were simply not capable of more naturalistic technique . Sadly , this film is one of the countless dramatic works which take the very misogynist attitude that a sexually desirable woman is a predator , a destroyer of men who deserves to die . The people who create such stories are usually heterosexual men who are afraid of their own sexual urges , but I've encountered a few dramatic works of that type which were authored by homosexual males who had their own problems with women . Which brings me to the single most distressing ( and weirdest ) aspect of this film . . . . . . namely , its production design . The actors playing the two brothers wear poncy cosmetics ( lipstick , nail lacquer , shaped eyebrows ) that make them look a right pair of drag queens , and they also wear skin-tight garments . There may be some women who are turned on by men who look like this , but the audience for such theatrics seems to be mostly gay males . I know nothing at all about the private life ( or sexual orientation ) of Jean Epstein or his sister Marie ; based on viewing this one film , they both seem to be deeply frightened of female sexuality , deeply hostile towards women , and deeply interested in eroticising the male face and physique in a manner that doesn't appeal to me as a typical ( ? ) heterosexual male , and which is unlikely to appeal to most other men or women , straight or gay . I suspect that the Epsteins have chosen here to cater for their own personal tastes : unfortunately , they've done so to the exclusion of any other audience for this film . Some movies that are deeply weird also manage to be brilliant . . . such as ' Caligari ' , ' Just Imagine ' , the Martian sequences in ' Aelita ' and the very wonderful ' The 5000 Fingers of Dr T ' : the latter is one of my all-time favourite movies . This ' 6 . 5x11 ' , however you typographise it , is just self-indulgent rubbish . On a scale of 10 , I'll give it 3 points purely for technical proficiency . Sadly , I can't even call it the weirdEST film I've ever seen . I know that I don't want to see it again .
419323	1609079	22107	3.0	The acting drags , the plot drags , the drag drags .	' Maid to Order ' is a low-budget comedy , not especially funny , of interest only because it's a sound film starring Julian Eltinge , who was primarily a stage performer . Eltinge was a female impersonator , probably the most successful of them all . ( Unless those rumours are true about a certain actress . ) Eltinge began his stage career as a child performer , in girls ' roles . As a star performer , he usually played men in stage farces who ( for contrived reasons ) masqueraded as women . But Eltinge often played genuine women as well . Photographs and reviews of the time indicate that , as a young man , Eltinge was very convincing in his disguises as attractive young ladies . ( Female fans often asked Eltinge for fashion and beauty tips . ) But by the time Eltinge began his film career , middle age had set in , and his female impersonations began to look somewhat matronly . Eltinge was approaching fifty when he filmed ' Maid to Order ' , so his girlish soubrette days were long past . Here , he plays a fictionalised version of himself , now equipped with an interest in police work and detective stories . The police are trying to catch a gang of smugglers who are bringing diamonds into the country concealed in coffee tins . ( I guess the cocaine smugglers aren't worth bothering with . ) The leader of the gang is a notorious femme fatale who is on her way Stateside to oversee the operation . . . until a cable arrives from Scotland Yard , notifying the local police that she's been nabbed . Conveniently , none of the local gangsters know what their henchwoman looks like . So , of course , you can guess what happens next . The police persuade Eltinge to infiltrate the gang by impersonating the she-gangster . I was more interested in hearing this movie than seeing it , for two reasons . Eltinge , at this point in his life and career , was not very pretty . In ' Maid to Order ' , he's much more heavy-set than he was in his silent films , and this is especially evident in his neck and his face . Men's and women's faces age differently , and Eltinge looks more male here than in his earlier films . But it was his voice that I wanted to hear , to determine how convincing Eltinge's vocal masquerade was . Based on this movie , it wasn't very good . In his female disguise , Eltinge resorts to the same falsetto range that most male comedians use when doing drag routines . I'll give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that , in his younger days , Eltinge was more adept at speaking in a female voice . Here , he uses a European accent for his drag scenes : the accent isn't especially convincing , but it helps distract us from the male register of his voice . ( This is the same reason why Dustin Hoffman used a Southern accent for his female scenes in ' Tootsie ' . ) Eltinge should have followed the example of Lon Chaney , who very convincingly impersonated an old woman in ' The Unholy Three ' . For that talking film , Chaney created a female voice by speaking quietly and enunciating very precisely . . . without resorting to falsetto tactics . ' Maid to Order ' has a profoundly contrived set-up : couldn't the cops find a policewoman to decoy the smugglers ? Tough guy Al Hill and nervous little George E Stone are good in their roles as two crooks , but this movie is about as plausible as a Three Stooges short . . . without being nearly so funny . ' Maid to Order ' is crudely shot and badly paced , filmed on a poverty budget . Out of respect for Eltinge's long stage career , I'll rate this dragging drag act .
419498	1609079	18607	3.0	Bolshevik borscht	The Hollywood producer Sam Goldwyn had a Greta Garbo complex : for well over a decade , he made repeated attempts to find some exotic European actress whom he could lure to Hollywood and mould into the next Garbo . He brought several would-be Garbos to Hollywood , but none of them ever clicked . The least unsuccessful of these was Anna Sten , who was pretty and somewhat talented but definitely no Garbo . Several years after Sten's career failed to take off , Goldwyn was still importing new Garbo wanna-be's . . . with the result that one of them became known as " Goldwyn's Last Sten " . ' Zemlya v plenu ' is intended as a starring vehicle for Anna Stein ; she is pretty and personable here , but hardly a great actress . Yakov is a poor sharecropper who comes back from the war and marries his childhood love , the illiterate peasant girl Maria ( Sten ) . When Yakov tries to lease an acre of land from the local nobleman ( a Baron who is literally a land baron ) , the Baron rents to Yakov and Maria the acre which is at the very bottom of his valley . . . so it is full of all the boulders and stones which have rolled down both sides of the hill . When Yakov falls behind on the rent , the Baron forces Maria to come to his estate and work as a nurse-companion for his adult daughter Anya . Still working the farm , Yakov sends letters to his illiterate wife , telling her how terrible things are . Maria asks Anya to read the letters for her . Anya wants to keep Maria with her on the manor , so she maliciously deludes Maria . . . pretending to read the letters aloud but actually inventing new text in which Yakov reports that everything is tickety-boo down on the farm . Eventually Anya's husband tries to rape Maria . When she defends herself , the Baron and his household close ranks round his son-in-law ( can't have any scandal , you know ) , and Maria is falsely denounced as a prostitute . When the news reaches Yakov , will he still love her ? When I saw this movie , I understood Ira Gershwin's line about " more skies of grey than any Russian play " . This is a Russian soap opera , full of gloom and doom and mutterings . Sten's performance is good , but nowhere near Garbo's standards . The actor who plays Yakov is good , although he overdoes his peasant get-up . Mikhail Markov is excellent as the lip-curling Baron . The actor playing the son-in-law is competent , whilst the actress portraying Anya overacts horribly . Much of the content is intended as communist propaganda : we're clearly meant to see how terrible things used to be in Russia during the bad old days of the White Russian aristocracy . There are some beautiful exterior shots in this movie , and the lighting and art direction are excellent . I wish that the various talents involved in this film had been able to collaborate on better material . I'll rate this movie . Pass the borscht , comrade .
419128	1609079	10045	3.0	' Dangerous Hours ' ? More like ' Dangerous Howlers ' .	The best thing about the movie ' Dangerous Hours ' is its title . I've never made any secret of the fact that I despise all forms of communism , especially the Soviet variety , and that I also despise movies which depict communism favourably . Well , ' Dangerous Hours ' is fervently anti-communist , and yet it delivers its message so dishonestly ( and manipulates the audience so egregiously ) that I very nearly felt sorry for the communists ! I certainly felt sorry for the actors lumbered with playing Trotskyites in this inept movie . Handsome but bland Lloyd Hughes plays John King . With a name like that , you know he's a crusading idealist . He observes a picket line at a silk factory , and then notices that outside agitators ( redlegs ? ) are infiltrating the union . When John tells a policeman that these agitators are merely trying to uplift humanity , the cop ( in a nicely cynical line ) replies that they can do it someplace further up the street . Along comes exotic blonde Sophia Guerni . With a name like that , you know she's a slimy foreigner . Sophia has a penchant for wearing heavily frogged shirts of the style usually favoured by Volga boatmen ; the rig makes her look like Eugene Onegin . Enticed by Sophia , naive John involves himself in the workers ' struggle , not realising that he's merely being duped by the bolshies . Into this borscht bounds a bolshevik who rejoices in the monicker Boris Blotchi . With a name like that , you know he's a filthy agitator . Boris is Blotchi by name and blotchy by nature . He's also a Russian communist who has come to the United States with the specific agenda of organising American labourers away from their legitimate grievances and into a movement to overthrow democracy . He and Sophia are in cahoots . . . I mean , they're comrades in the revolution . SPOILERS COMING . It's clear to us ( but not to John ) that the coldly beautiful Sophia is interested in him only because she can exploit him as a dupe . But the rather less exotic May Weston is attracted to John unselfishly . . . and May is 100 % yankee-doodle American . It's no mystery how this movie will end , but before it gets there John is embroiled in a climactic strike action that turns into a riot . ' Dangerous Hours ' does address real issues . When this movie was made ( 1919 ) , organisations such as the International Workers of the World were trying to organise and unionise American labourers . . . but those organisations were heavily infiltrated by communists and other agitators who had their own agenda that contradicted the workers ' interests , and most Americans ( including the labourers ) wisely mistrusted such organisers . Unfortunately , ' Dangerous Hours ' makes no attempt to address the issues honestly . This movie's intertitles constantly editorialise , telling the audience how we're supposed to think at every point in the narrative . As a staunch advocate of democracy , I'm always annoyed when dramatic works which advocate democracy don't trust their audiences or readers to think for themselves . All of the communist characters in this film are stereotypes , and the actors depict them accordingly . The bland Lloyd Hughes is now remembered only for ' The Lost World ' and ' The Mysterious Island ' , two science-fiction films in which he was easily upstaged by ( respectively ) a runaway brontosaurus and a horde of platypus humanoids . In the early sequences of ' Dangerous Hours ' , Hughes's blandness actually works in his favour ; we accept him as a blank slate on which the wily Sophia can write her agenda . Later in the film , when John King recovers his wits and his conscience , Hughes is less believable . Interestingly , two years after starring in ' Dangerous Hours ' , Lloyd Hughes gave possibly the best performance of his career in ' Hail the Woman ' : in a supporting role , again as a naive young man who is easily led ( this time by his father ) yet who again recovers his integrity and his courage by the final reel . ' Dangerous Hours ' and ' Hail the Woman ' were both scripted or co-scripted by C . Gardner Sullivan ; I suspect that Hughes's vastly superior performance in the latter film was down to the expert direction of John Griffith Wray . . . a much better director than Fred Niblo , who helmed ' Dangerous Hours ' . Wray's premature death was a great loss to the cinema . Some of the other reviewers on IMDb seem to feel that I rate movies based on whether or not they stroke my own personal predilections . If that were true , then - - since I'm extremely anti-communist and pro-democracy - - I had ought to give high marks to ' Dangerous Hours ' . In fact , although I agree with this movie's politics , I dislike its weak story telling , its dishonest depictions of communists , and its inability to trust the audience to think for ourselves . My rating for this one : just , mostly for the production values . Pass the borscht , comrade .
419438	1609079	18717	3.0	No midgets , no ventriloquists .	I sought out ' The Branded Man ' because it was based on a story by Tod Robbins , author of some grotesque fiction . I was disappointed twice over : firstly , this story contains no homicidal midgets , schizophrenic ventriloquists , nor any of the other bizarre elements in Robbins's best work . Secondly , even on its own merits , this story isn't much more than prosaic . Here goes . Fred Colgate is a simple homespun man who happens to be immensely rich , thanks to a convenient inheritance . ( In real life , Tod Robbins inherited money as a young man , and married a couple of millionaire heiresses . ) As part of his inheritance , Fred finds himself the landlord of a block of flats . While inspecting his property , he meets one of his tenants - - the mercenary Eleanor - - who straight away vamps him and marries him . But Eleanor isn't faithful . When Fred catches her vamping another man , he's so humiliated he abandons his business and runs away , leaving everyone to assume that Fred is dead . He's not dead : he's just in Mexico , where he's decided to start all over as a prizefighter . ( Andy Clyde , usually a performer in comedy roles , is excellent as his trainer . ) Meanwhile , Fred has a reunion with sweet Louise , who knew him when he was poor . . . and now that he's poor again , she loves him . SPOILERS COMING NOW . Eleanor is murdered by her lover , leaving Fred free to reclaim his abandoned identity - - and his money - - and to marry Louise . I found this movie more than somewhat implausible . Its title refers to the fact that Fred feels branded , stigmatised by his wife's infidelity . But why should her behaviour be a reflection on him ? I was never able to respect the leading character in this movie , because he felt guilty for events that weren't his own fault , and he didn't stand up to defend his reputation . It doesn't help that the art direction and production values are so poor . Sadly , I'll rate this movie just , for the good performances of Andy Clyde and Gordon Griffith despite a badly-written script .
418860	1609079	51362	3.0	Eugene O'Neill did it better .	' Anna Lucasta ' was originally a stage play with a white cast , filmed in 1949 . A few years on from its debut , the play's original author ( Philip Yordan ) re-staged it with all the roles played by African-Americans . This was considered something of a gimmick at the time , but the gimmick was still fresh a bit later when Pearl Bailey played the Jewish matchmaker Dolly Levi in an all-black Broadway production of ' Hello , Dolly ! ' And before ' Anna Lucasta ' , there was Bizet's opera reworked with African-American characters as ' Carmen Jones ' . I'm hugely a fan of Sammy Davis Jnr , who plays the male lead in this all-black remake , so I was curious to know why his ghost-written autobiography ' Yes I Can ' made almost no mention of ' Anna Lucasta ' . Now I know . The film is not very good . As young sailor Danny Johnson , on leave and looking for some lovin ' , Davis is physically well-cast but gives a poor performance . He would later prove himself a dramatic actor of considerable subtlety , but at this point in his career Davis was primarily a musical performer , and in ' Anna Lucasta ' he seems desperate for an excuse to burst into song or dance . With no music cues to fall back on , Davis overacts shamelessly here . The title role is played by Eartha Kitt , whom I've always found painful to watch . She really overdoes the feline routine . It was acceptable when she played Catwoman ( literally a comic-book character ) or in ' Shinbone Alley ' , in which Kitt actually played an alley cat , but ' Anna Lucasta ' is a serious drama requiring some subtlety , and the words ' Eartha Kitt ' and ' subtle ' don't fit into the same sentence . I got a big laugh a few years ago , when Eartha Kitt was exposed as a pretentious know-nothing . In 1998 , she made a public statement that she was a lifelong devotee of astrology : she had scrupulously followed her horoscope , and it had guided her through her successful career . Shortly after she made this statement , someone located Eartha Kitt's birth certificate . . . and it turned out that , all these years , she'd been following the horoscope for the wrong birth date ! Anna Lucasta is a small-town girl whose father Joe is outraged at her moral lapses , so he orders her out of his house . Then he hypocritically tries to reconcile with her for selfish reasons , hoping to marry her off to Rudolph , the son of Joe's evil crony Frank . In the important role of pious Rudolph , actor Henry Scott is too stolid and stodgy . If he had been a bit more energetic , and Sammy Davis had been a bit less energetic , this would have been a better film . And it's never explained how the shifty Frank has produced such a goody-goody son . The primary blame for this film's flaws should go to author Philip Yordan , who adapted his own script for the screen . ' Anna Lucasta ' comes off like a poor imitation of several Eugene O'Neill plays , specifically ' Anna Christie ' . . . which even has a similar name . Changing the characters into Negroes ( to use the 1959 terminology ) gave roles to some black actors but was not otherwise a good idea . ' Anna Lucasta ' takes place in a sleazy semi-noir universe , in which a sexually attractive woman can only be a slut or an outright whore . By populating that universe with African-Americans , and excluding any positive role models - - there's not one genuinely sympathetic character in this entire piece - - Yordan has ( perhaps unintentionally ) implied that humanity's negative traits are typified by black people . I'll rate this movie . Much as I dislike Eartha Kitt , she has done better work elsewhere . So has Sammy Davis Jnr .
419672	1609079	54759	4.0	. . . but don't come too often	' Come September ' is an amusing bit of trifle that falls well short of hilarity . One major flaw in this film ( for modern viewers ) is that it stars Rock Hudson as a ladies ' man : a casting decision which is apt to provoke unintended laughter . But fair do's here : at the time this film was made , Hudson gave some very successful portrayals of swinging bachelors in sparkling sex comedies that are still enjoyable today , even with our hindsight knowledge of Rock Hudson's private life . So , the problem with ' Come September ' isn't the casting of Hudson in the lead role . It's down to a bad script , slow direction and an awkward premise . Hudson portrays a millionaire playboy named Robert Lawrence Talbot . Well , that name alone is a problem : I sat through the whole movie wondering if he was related to Lawrence Talbot out of the Wolfman movies . All through this movie , I kept expecting the full moon to rise and turn Rock Hudson into a werewolf . Gina Lollobrigida - - quite sexy here , but her sexiness wasted on Rock Hudson - - plays an Italian peasant named Lisa Fellini . That name set off my alarm bells . It's as if some American screenwriter said : " We need a good Italian name for this character . Hey , what's the name of that Italian movie director ? Fellini ? We'll call her Fellini ! " Right , that's the names sorted . Talbot ( Hudson ) is an American millionaire who owns a gorgeous Italian villa by the sea . He also has a gorgeous Italian mistress ( Lollobrigida ) , whom he keeps ensconced in said villa . So far , so good . Now here's where the plot goes pear-shaped : Talbot enters this mansion ( and this mistress ) on a regular basis , but only ever in September . ( Hence the title : ' Come September ' , geddit ? ) Eleven months of each year , Talbot is dallying elsewhere . He's perfectly willing to leave Gina Lollabrigida twiddling her thumbs ( or whatever she twiddles ) for eleven months at a time , and likewise he doesn't spare a thought for the villa during those eleven months either . Yet , every September , he expects the villa and his mistress to be ready and waiting for him , just as when he left . Right there , I had serious difficulty empathising with Hudson's character in this film . A major-domo named Clavell ( played very well by Walter Slezak ) keeps the villa in good nick during Talbot's absence . Anyway , that's the backstory . After pulling this September routine for so many years , this year Talbot decides to show up in July . . . two months ahead of schedule . Much to his surprise , Talbot discovers that Clavell is running the villa as a swank hotel - La Dolce Vista - and that the place is full of guests . . . who are paying their lodging fees to Clavell , not to Talbot . Under the circumstances , I couldn't much blame Clavell for doing this . This film provides an interesting look at Joel Grey in a very early role , when he was still young and athletic . Brenda de Banzie is good as the chaperone for some girls . Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee are bland and boring . A pity that this movie isn't very good , nor especially funny . But there are some nice shots of the Italian countryside ( and some dodgy process photography ) . I'll rate ' Come September ' .
418939	1609079	200588	4.0	Some Turks eat garlic . . .	' Dracula in Istanbul ' deserves credit for an honest title , at least . This Turkish-made film sticks fairly close to the original plot of Bram Stoker's novel ( greatly simplified ) , apart from moving the action to Istanbul in the present day ( 1953 ) , presumably as a budget-saving device and in order to make the film more ' relevant ' to its target audience . . . much as the Hollywood version of H . G . Wells's ' War of the Worlds ' moved the action to modern Los Angeles . Dracula is played here by Atif Kaptan , who was apparently ( I'm told ) a horror-film veteran in Turkey , somewhat equivalent to Peter Cushing . He plays Count Dracula in impeccable ( modern ) formal dress : white tie and tails . He is also completely clean-shaven and slap-headed , looking vaguely like a cross between Max Schreck in ' Nosferatu ' and Kojak . The English characters in Stoker's novel are Turkish here , with appropriate name changes . The most significant change in the storyline is the conversion of demure ingenue Mina Seward into a fleshly cabaret dancer named Guzin , erotically depicted by Annie Ball . She gives an intriguing performance , turning me on more than somewhat , but this alteration weakens the story . Much of the horror in Stoker's novel comes from the contrast between the virginal Mina and the profane unholy nature of the undead . In this Turkish film , the Mina character Guzin is already depicted as a ' bad ' girl , so somehow it doesn't seem quite so shocking when Dracula threatens to recruit her into the undead's legions . This film was made on a laughably low budget , only a bare notch above the Ed Wood level . Yet the lighting and photography impressed me , and the Turkish locations are very interesting . I wish I could say I was impressed with the actors ' performances : perhaps Turkish cinema audiences actually prefer a more stylised acting technique than I'm accustomed to viewing . I'll rate this Turkish delight .
418713	1609079	41626	4.0	Thud and blunder	I sought out this 1949 movie ' The Man from Yesterday ' because one of my mentors ( the American journalist George Markstein ) wrote a novel several decades later with the same title , and I wanted to know if this film was any influence upon him . I doubt it , now I've seen this . Markstein's novel is a taut spy thriller . This low-budget film is a semi-occult melodrama , somewhere in the borderland between ' Dead of Night ' and ' One Step Beyond ' , without being quite so satisfying as either of those . There is a ' twist ' ending which reminded me of ' An Inspector Calls ( and , again , ' Dead of Night ' ) but which is far more contrived than the ending of Priestley's drama . SPOILERS COMING . Julius Rickman , who claims to be a psychic , is summoned to the home of Doris Amersley . She hopes Rickman can contact the spirit of her deceased fiancé . In the meantime she has married another man ( Gerald ) and taken his name , yet she still loves the dead man . Then Doris dies mysteriously , and Rickman accuses Doris's husband Gerald of having murdered his wife and her previous fiancé out of jealousy . Gerald argues the point by murdering Rickman . The whole thing turns out to be ( guess what ) a dream . . . but there's another twist coming . ' The Man from Yesterday ' is moderately interesting , but strongly resembles several other dramas which are all better and more original than this one . It doesn't help that none of these actors give especially good performances . I personally liked Gwynneth Vaughan , but she's not for all tastes . In a supporting role , Laurence Harvey seems to be rehearsing for his performance as a zombie in ' The Manchurian Candidate ' . We get a couple of interesting camera set-ups on the way to that ending . I'll rate ' The Man from Yesterday ' just .
419253	1609079	188915	4.0	Let's play the Minute Game !	Alexander Woollcott is now remembered primarily as the inspiration for ' The Man Who Came to Dinner ' . He was also the prototype for Addison DeWitt , the drama critic played by George Sanders in his Oscar-winning performance in ' All About Eve ' . There was more than a trace of ' ham ' in Woollcott ; he starred on Broadway in a play by S . N . Behrman , and he also performed in a stage version of ' The Man Who Came to Dinner ' , playing the lead role that was based on himself . But the handful of films in which Woollcott appeared prove that he was no actor . In the 1930s , Woollcott's radio commentaries were a major influence on American culture : if Woollcott praised a book , it immediately became a best-seller . If Woollcott praised an actress , her fame was assured . Woollcott also loved games and puzzles , and popularised many of these . He is credited with inventing the knock-knock joke , and may also have invented a similar game in which players are given a word and challenged to incorporate it into a complicated pun . " Mr W's Little Game " is a short film , not precisely a comedy , intended to introduce us to the Minute Game . . . a pleasant little game of the sort which used to be popular at parties . Woollcott appears here as himself , dining in a posh restaurant , with a waiter in attendance and a brassy blonde as his dinner companion . Unfortunately , all conviction that this is a ' real ' situation is dispelled immediately because we recognise the ' waiter ' as character actor Leo G . Carroll . Also , although Woollcott in real life had many intimate ( sexless ) friendships with beautiful actresses , the woman whom he is dating in this movie is - - frankly - - not a very plausible dining companion for the prissy , fastidious Woollcott . During their rather dull dinner , Woollcott proposes a quick round of ' the Minute Game ' . His blonde companion understandably asks : ' What's the Minute Game ? ' and Woollcott promptly replies : ' Tell you in a minute . ' That's the closest thing to a laugh in this movie . Then he explains how the game works , and it really does sound like a fun game worth trying . The Minute Game requires at least three people , who take it in turns as the player , the scorekeeper and the timekeeper . The scorekeeper calls out a letter of the alphabet , and the player then has one minute to name as many common objects ( no proper names ! ) as he or she can think of , which begin with that letter : the scorekeeper tallies the count , and the timekeeper cuts off the player after precisely one minute . Score one point for each accepted item . For example , if you are given the letter A , you could score points for ' apple ' , ' ape ' , ' apricot ' and so forth . The letters Q , X and Z are excluded as being too difficult . There's some clever editing near the end of this short film . The patrons at neighbouring tables have overheard Woollcott's description of the rules , and now the game has spread to all the tables . In a series of quick shots , we see diners at each table playing the Minute Game , with a different letter being played at each table . It's really too bad that simple little games of this sort ( which require a bit of brainpower ) are no longer popular , and that they've been replaced by complicated and expensive pocket-sized electronic games . . . which require no brains at all , and which make annoying sounds in public places . I'll rate " Mr W's Little Game " . A pleasant little time-passer .
418802	1609079	248078	4.0	Defective detectives .	If Larry Semon had made more comedies like ' Her Boy Friend ' , his career might have lasted longer and ended more happily . Semon's typical screen character was a gormless menial labourer , a stumbling simpleton who came up trumps through dumb luck and accident . In ' Her Boy Friend ' , amazingly enough , Larry Semon plays a character more typical of silent-film comedian Raymond Griffith : he's well-dressed , cultured , and resourceful . At one point in this film , Semon punches a villain ; more usually , he played a coward who only found his courage in the climactic sequence if at all . Oliver Hardy , not yet teamed with Stan Laurel , did stalwart supporting work in many of Semon's films . Typically , Hardy played the foreman to Semon's dogsbody . . . or at any rate someone more respectable than Semon's drudge . In ' Her Boy Friend ' , Semon's well-dressed and sophisticated appearance is made even more remarkable by contrasting it with Hardy's appearance : cast as an escaped murderer , Hardy is unshaven and filthy here . Many of Semon's films are marred by unfunny and racist ' gag ' sequences featuring a cowardly black man . On this score , sadly , ' Her Boy Friend ' is all too typically a Semon movie . There's an unpleasant and unfunny sequence in which Hardy's villain bullies a black man . For once , Hardy plays his role in a Semon film almost dead-earnest ; it's a shame that Oliver Hardy didn't get more dramatic roles , as he could have been an excellent character actor . In this movie , as in several other Semon efforts , the black actor is Spencer Bell . Here , he does his usual scream-and-scarper routine , made slightly more unusual because he dives into water and swims away rather than running . Trust Larry Semon to take an unfunny gag and make it unfunnier ; this sequence is undercranked , so that Spencer Bell's cowardly Negro swims at superhuman speed . But , as even the lowliest film-maker knows ( or ought to know ) , undercranking should never be done in shots featuring open water , as the water will move too fast . The sequence is blatantly faked , and this obvious fakery removes every last vestige of humour . ' Her Boy Friend ' features more impressive sets and production design than usual for a Semon film , and Dorothy Dwan ( Semon's off-screen wife ) is more attractive than usual here as an undercover detective . Frank Alexander is cast as a character named ' Slim Chance ' : a bad joke , as Alexander is even bigger and fatter than Oliver Hardy . . . in fact , Alexander's mere presence in this film does much to undercut Hardy's effectiveness , since - - for once - - Hardy's not the biggest guy in the movie . I'll rate this weak effort just , which is also - - in spite of Semon's efforts to vary his formula here - - pretty much where Larry Semon's entire film career should rate .
418531	1609079	245294	4.0	ILL-MET by ' Moonlight ' . . .	' Moonlight ' is ( so far ) the only movie I've ever seen that was shot in Luxembourg , but I fervently hope it's not a typical example of Luxembourgeoise cinema . This movie is a lot more arty-tarty than it needs to be . For starters , the title is nearly irrelevant : some of the action takes place in a house named Mondschein ( ' moonlight ' ) , but that name is completely arbitrary and unrelated to the plot . SPOILERS COMING . ' Moonlight ' is the first movie I've seen that's directed by Paula van der Oest , and ( again ) I fervently hope this is not a typical example of her craft . In ' Moonlight ' , she shows a penchant for camera set-ups that are distracting and serve no useful purpose . When young Claire feeds her dog , van der Oest plumps for an overhead shot as if we were watching a Busby Berkeley musical . Later , Claire and the fugitive boy break into a house during the resident family's absence , and then attempt some sexual fumblings in the parents ' bed . . . only to be caught in the act when two people walk in . Van der Oest uses a very contrived camera set-up to make us think that the arrivals are the parents , then uses a reverse angle to reveal that they are actually the family's son and daughter . The switcheroo serves absolutely no purpose except to disorient us . Elsewhere , Claire tells the boy that she's a foundling : is this true , or is it a lie told in a childish attempt to impress him ? We never find out . Either way , it's irrelevant to the story . ' Moonlight ' could have been a straightforward thriller . A boy from an unnamed country ( apparently Turkey ) has arrived in Luxembourg as a drugs ' mule ' , his digestive tract packed with condoms filled with narcotic contraband . When he fails to excrete them quickly enough , a drugs runner shoots him and leaves him for dead . . . but stupidly doesn't bother to check . The girl Claire finds the boy and helps him , but oddly she never tells her parents about him . ( If she's a foundling , they must be her foster parents . ) Very implausibly , she runs away from home with the boy , having no clear destination in mind . Are there no police in Luxembourg ? The film places some emphasis on pubescent sexuality : Claire experiences her menarche just before she finds the bleeding boy , and there's some attempt to equate her bloodstained knickers with his bloodstained gut . Later , there's a deeply implausible sequence in which the two runaways enrol themselves in a girls ' convent school , where the nuns accept them without question . Claire introduces the boy as her sister : he is very clearly male ( even while wearing a Communion dress ) , yet all the nuns and at least one priest automatically accept him as a girl . Speaking of girls ' clothing , I could have done without the shot of the Down's Syndrome girl stripping off to her bra and underpants . Obscure joke : Claire's dog is named Quick , and at one point the dog seems to have a stunt double . I couldn't help wondering if the stunt double's name is Flupke . ( Americans won't get this reference . ) This is one of those movies in which increasingly contrived events keep happening . . . and AFTER each one occurs , we realise that it didn't really happen after all : Claire seems to be turning more and more hallucinatory as the film proceeds . At the end of the film , Claire commits suicide by an extremely implausible method . Or . . . DOES she ? Sheesh ! I well and truly wanted to like this film . When director van der Oest puts aside her arty crotchets and she sticks to the story , she shows some genuine narrative talent despite the increasing incoherence of this plot line . In the lead role as Claire , young actress Laurien Van den Broeck is extremely pretty and personable , with significant screen presence . I wish her good luck elsewhere in other projects . If you watch any five consecutive minutes of ' Moonlight ' , you'll mistake this for a brilliant film . If you watch it from beginning to end , as I did , your response will likely be similar to mine : namely , " HUH ? " I wish that all this talent and these resources had been devoted to a more coherent screenplay , and I regretfully rate ' Moonlight ' only .
419631	1609079	24484	4.0	Hitler comes to Hollywood	A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that ' Rafter Romance ' is a ' rip-off ' ( that's the other reviewer's term ) of a German musical called ' Me By Day , You By Night ' . Apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from ' Box and Cox ' , an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847 . This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady , each man believing himself the sole tenant . Because the two men have different work schedules , the ruse is not discovered straight away . This play was once so popular in Britain that ' to Box and Cox it ' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person . The innovation of ' Rafter Romance ' ( and its predecessor ) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman , who inevitably develop a romance . As is usual in these cornball movies , the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other's arms . Hoo boy . The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney , a character actor who specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic . George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green ( the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit ) but Sidney's depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch . The single most notable thing about ' Rafter Romance ' is that , to my knowledge , this is the earliest Hollywood film to make reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism . At one point in this movie , landlord Eckbaum ( Sidney ) discovers his teenage son Julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls . The Eckbaum characters in this movie are clearly meant to be Jewish . Admittedly , few people in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe . . . still , it's surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke . His father is , quite properly , angered by this display of the Nazi symbol . A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939 . Hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as ' Aryan ' so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria . For the same reason , Hollywood's leading men were documented as ' Aryan and uncircumcised ' . Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox , all the Hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were Jewish . . . but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler . I'm surprised that ' Rafter Romance ' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably , as this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria . ( Maybe the scene was cut out for German release : it isn't crucial to the movie's plot . ) Apart from this , the movie contains nothing notable . Robert Benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation : I've never understood the appeal of this man . I'll rate ' Rafter Romance ' .
419611	1609079	20956	4.0	Boop-a-doop bootleggers	' Heads Up ' stars Helen Kane , who is now remembered only in parody as the prototype for Betty Boop . The animated character in the Fleischer cartoons is blatantly similar to Helen Kane's screen persona : same hairstyle , same annoying speaking voice ( Kane sounds like Gracie Allen on helium ) , same ' boop-oop-a-doop ' syllables scatted into the breaks in her lyrics . Kane sued the Fleischer studio : amazingly , she lost , and Max Fleischer then released a gloating newsreel clip featuring several chorus girls made up to look like Kane . Helen Kane's home studio ( Paramount ) didn't care about the controversy , as they were also distributing Fleischer's Betty Boop cartoons . . . and making more money off the animated imitation than off the live-action original . None of Helen Kane's movies are very good , except for ' Paramount on Parade ' ( in which she has merely a guest shot ) and just possibly ' Sweetie ' ( in which she plays only a supporting role ) , so her films are seldom revived . The Boop cartoons , of course , are constantly revived . . . so , for modern viewers seeing Kane for the first time , it's hard to avoid the perception that Helen Kane is imitating Betty Boop rather than just the other way round . It seems very unfair that the original has been entirely upstaged by the Boop-a-Duplicate . In ' Heads Up ' , Kane actually plays a character named Betty , which gives you an idea of where Fleischer got the name for his cartoon character . ' Heads Up ' was originally a flop Broadway musical with tunes by Rodgers and Hart , who are the only songwriters listed in this film's on-screen credits ( unless you count director Victor Schertzinger , who also wrote tunes ) . The songs in this movie are quite lame , easily Rodgers's and Hart's bottom-drawer stuff . I did enjoy some very spirited hoofing by little Billy Taylor during one of Kane's songs : why didn't Taylor ever make it in musicals ? High-society Newport widow Martha Trumbull owns a yacht , the Silver Lady , for the private use of herself and her two daughters Mary and Betty . Mary ( Margaret Breen ) is meant to be the ' pretty ' sister , and Betty ( Helen Kane ) is meant to be the ' funny ' sister , but neither is much of either . The wealthy Mrs Trumbull employs Captain Denny and Skippy Dugan to staff the yacht , but they're often kept idle at the quay because the family aren't using the yacht . So , to make valuable use of his time , the villainous Denny uses the Silver Lady for bootleg runs . He takes her out beyond the three-mile-limit and comes back with hooch . The galley cook Skippy - - more like a galley slave - - is played by Victor Moore . I've never found Moore funny , but I'm intensely in awe of his career as a performer . Some major Broadway musicals had roles written specifically as vehicles for Moore . I've interviewed old-time Broadway figures who worked with Moore , and they tell me that he was a genuinely modest and self-effacing man . I really want to like him on the screen , but he tends to play the same character every time . . . and I find that character very wearying . Here , Moore invents bizarre contraptions that seem more appropriate for certain other comedians of this same period ( Ed Wynn , Joe Cook , Clark & McCulloch ) rather than for Moore's usual characterisation . Moore keeps mispronouncing his dialogue : he pronounces ' baloney ' so it rhymes with ' mahogany ' . Most of his other mispronunciations are so subtle , it's not clear whether they're genuine errors or bad attempts to be funny . The male lead is Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , except that the credits don't include his nickname ' Buddy ' . He plays a handsome Coast Guard officer who teams up with gumshoe Gene Gowing to catch the bootleggers . There is , of course , a romantic subplot between Rogers and Breen . . . and if you can't guess how it ends , you haven't been paying attention . The camera-work throughout is wretched . During the cotillion sequence , a shot begins with two people standing slightly off-centre in the frame . The camera nudges itself slightly to starboard , to centre the actors . Then a third person enters at the left , and the camera moves leftward to re-centre the shot . Similar adjustments occur throughout the film . During Kane's most elaborate dance number , we briefly see an overhead shot of the sort which most people think was invented by Busby Berkeley . Elsewhere in this same number , a very personable and beautiful chorus girl does splendid knee lifts right behind Kane : I wish that the camera had shoved Kane out of the way to concentrate on this chorus girl . I suspect that the title of this movie is a cheeky joke . The phrase ' Heads Up ' is never spoken nor sung anywhere in the film . . . but the movie has a maritime theme , and guess which part of a ship is the ' head ' . Otherwise , the jokes on offer here are slightly mouldy . When villainous Captain Denny ( Harry Shannon ) asks Victor Moore ' You know what mutiny is , don't you ? ' , Moore replies ' Yes , sir . Mutiny is a show they give in the afternoon . ' Get the hook ! I'll rate this flotsam , mostly out of sympathy for the production difficulties of early movie musicals .
418771	1609079	25466	4.0	Weltschmertz on the high seas	I agree with a previous IMDb reviewer , who said that this film is clumsy German propaganda . ( There were times when Nazi propaganda was very subtle and artful . . . but you wouldn't know it here . ) ' A Man Wants to Go to Germany ' does seem intent upon preparing German audiences for another war . . . which is rather frightening , as this movie was made in 1934 : comparatively early in Hitler's regime , at a time when other world leaders still considered him a man who could be reasoned with . This film is set in 1914 . Hagen and Brack are two young German men , working in a factory in Argentina . When Archduke Ferdinand is assassinated , and the Kaiser declares war , these two young cannon-fodders are perfectly placed to say ' Good job we're on a completely different continent , then . ' But they're loyal Germans , so they straight away rush to get home and enlist . They book passage homeward aboard a liner , sailing under neutral colours . But the ship is intercepted by a British naval vessel , crewed entirely by hissably effete Englishmen ( played by hissably incompetent German actors ) . Our two krautmeisters are illegally arrested in international waters and transported to a PoW camp in Jamaica , which is filled with comical West Indians ( played by Germans in blackface ) . One of them attempts a Jamaican accent . SPOILERS COMING . Hagen and Brack cross paths with an exotic Cuban señorita named Manuela , played by a German actress with the monicker Brigitte Horney ( a name to conjure with ) . Watching this movie in the early 21st century , when Hitler's crimes are in the past but Fidel Castro's crimes are still a going concern , I was intrigued that a Nazi movie would feature a Cuban heroine . Fraulein Horney helps Hans and Fritz escape , and she is so entranced by handsome Hagen ( a strapping example of manly Aryan youth ) that she accompanies him and Brack back to Germany . Happy endings all round , although German audiences in 1934 must have realised that Hagen and Brack are going home to fight a war that would end in a humiliating defeat for the Kaiser , and a huge death toll . . . This film goes far out of its way to depict Germans as noble , Cubans as exotic and sensual , the English as effete bullies , and West Indian negroes as subhuman idiots . One wonders if the filmmakers actually believed their own propaganda , or if they were merely intent on brainwashing their audiences . The most interesting credit here is that of Paul Wegener , a vitally important German film actor whose talents as a director are often overlooked yet very much in evidence here in this well-paced ( though ludicrous ) film . The exterior sequences are very impressive , especially those taking place in Cuba . ( I wonder where these scenes were actually shot . ) Purely for its entertainment value , I'll ignore this movie's loathsome political agenda and I'll rate it .
419138	1609079	26385	5.0	Where's an earthquake when you really need one ?	' Frisco Kid ' was made at Warner Brothers , the studio that most ruthlessly ripped off and recycled its own scripts in thinly-disguised remakes . This movie re-uses elements from ' Barbary Coast ' , another ( and better ) Warners film made the same year ! The barroom brawl in ' Frisco Kid ' seems to be inspired by the climax of Rex Beach's popular novel ' The Spoilers ' , which had been filmed before ' Frisco Kid ' and would be remade afterwards . James Cagney - always dynamic onscreen , yet not quite at the top of his form here - stars as Bat Morgan , a hustler who came west during the gold rush of 1849 and now finds himself a year later in San Francisco's notorious Barbary Coast . ( Which got its name due to the lawlessness that prevailed : a reference to the real Barbary coast , which was controlled by pirates . ) Morgan proves his mettle early on , in a spirited brawl with press-gangman Shanghai Duck , who has a hook for a right hand . We find out just how tough this community is when Ricardo Cortez gets killed by a lynch mob due to a misunderstanding . Morgan soon sets himself up as proprietor of a Barbary Coast saloon with a crooked casino . He makes deals with the local politicians , offering them a share of the profits from his prostitution and gambling businesses to avoid being raided or arrested . ( I found this absolutely plausible ; the San Francisco city government was notoriously corrupt , from Gold Rush days right until the 1906 earthquake . ) He also befriends Jean Barrat , the lady owner of the local newspaper . This is one of those movies in which the virtuous heroine is attracted to a crooked hero , fully aware that he's crooked , and we're expected to approve because the crook is such a charming guy . The newspaperwoman is played by dull unattractive Margaret Lindsay , so the romantic subplot of this movie isn't worth much . Eventually , Judge Crawford - the only honest man in town - gets murdered , and the mob mistakenly decide that Bat Morgan is guilty . This whips them into a lynch-mob frenzy . Why the San Franciscans should be provoked to lynch-law over this particular crime - while ignoring so many other crimes in this movie - is never made very clear . We're meant to sympathise with Bat Morgan , who is genuinely innocent of Crawford's murder , even though we know he's guilty of many other crimes . In 1935 , when ' Frisco Kid ' was made , lynching was a real and widespread problem in the United States . The tendency of white mobs to lynch black victims is well known , but at this time plenty of white victims were lynched too . ( The makers of this movie were probably more concerned about the white victims than the black ones . ) ' Fury ' , an anti-lynching movie made at MGM at this same time , is a much better film addressing the same problem . The torchlight climax of ' Frisco Kid ' degenerates into a bathetic payoff that's clearly intended to mollify the critics and the moral guardians . As is usual for Warners in the thirties , there's a fine assortment of supporting players on offer here . Barton MacLane is hissable as Spider Burke , little George E Stone is touching , and the woefully underrated actor John Wray is splendid as an underworld character named Weasel . ( John Wray played another underworld character named Weasel in ' Boys Town ' : he had a talent for rodent-like roles . ) Charles Middleton , Walter Long and Wilfred Lucas are onscreen just briefly enough to disappoint their fans . ( Does Wilfred Lucas have any fans ? ) ' Frisco Kid ' was made at the beginning of the Warner studio's greatest period - and at the beginning of the greatest phase of James Cagney's career - but it's neither first-rate Warners nor first-rate Cagney . I'll rate this movie .
418901	1609079	26491	5.0	Waller , Robinson , Le Gon transcend weak material .	' Hooray for Love ' is the great title of this goodish B-musical ( and of one poor song near the closing ) . The best assets of this so-so show are its three African-American performers : the great Fats Waller , the great Bill Robinson , and the very talented ( and pretty ) dancer Jeni Le Gon . In recent years , Ms Le Gon's career has received much attention in retrospective : oddly , she received far too little attention ( and far too few film appearances ) during her prime years as a dancer . This can't be entirely down to racism , as other black performers were working steadily during that period . I've never understood why Bill Robinson was nicknamed Bojangles . Some other tap dancers ( such as Buck and Bubbles ) wore double-plate tap shoes which created a jangling syncopated sound . But Robinson always performed in single-plate tap shoes which gave a clear crisp tone to his expert footwork . He's in fine form here , doing some of the best dancing of his career without the need to simplify his steps so that some lesser partner ( such as Shirley Temple ) can keep up with him . Jeni Le Gon shows her own expertise , easily keeping step with Robinson . Le Gon appears briefly in male garb , like Eleanor Powell . As usual for films of Hollywood's classic era , there are some treasures in the cast here . Pert Kelton is less annoying than usual , speaking in a normal voice ( for once ) . She performs a dance number which is intentionally inept , to good effect . Lionel Stander is good here , but would have been better if he weren't lumbered with an accent more appropriate for Gregory Ratoff or Leonid Kinskey . But the real find is Thurston Hall . A prolific character actor who appeared in literally hundreds of films , Hall usually played blustering millionaires . Here , he plays a Vitamin Flintheart-style " ack-torr " of the old school , and he practically steals the movie . Why didn't Hall get more chances like this ? Georgia Caine , as a Margaret Dumont-style dowager , is excellent here in her scenes with Hall . ( I kept waiting for some reference to ' Hall Caine ' . ) The plot of this musical is nothing much . I was surprised to learn that Bradford Ropes worked on the dialogue of this movie . Ropes , a former chorus boy and stage actor , wrote the backstage novel that inspired the film ' 42nd Street ' : he was an expert at realistic showbiz dialogue and cynical wisecracks . I can't imagine what he contributed to this lacklustre movie . At least one cliché was avoided here : for once , we see a chanteuse ( Ann Sothern ) who has to clean up her own dressing room , instead of relying on a chucklin ' black maidservant . One of the delights of films from Hollywood's studio era is the frequent tendency for some obscure actor to be given a piece of business or a line of dialogue which makes him stand out . Here , an actor named Monte Vandergrift ( who ? ) has precisely one line of dialogue . . . but his delivery earns him one of the biggest laughs in the movie . The songs ? Forget it . They're all pretty bad , but Waller , Robinson and Le Gon transcend their weak material through sheer force of talent . Also , we get a chance to study Fats Waller's fingerwork on the keyboard . . . but not while he's playing his trademark ' stride ' piano style . There are minor pleasures throughout ' Hooray for Love ' , and I'll rate this movie .
418848	1609079	53109	5.0	Near-miss , near-musical	' Never Steal Anything Small ' comes tantalisingly close to being a first-rate film , a sparkling musical comedy with some trenchant satirical commentary on the close relationship between politicians , labour unions and organised crime . James Cagney gives an ingratiating performance in what very nearly could have been one of his greatest roles . So close . . . and yet so far . In the event , this film is full of missed opportunities and near misses . Firstly , this movie is almost but not quite a full-fledged musical . The film starts out promisingly before the opening credits , with Cagney chanting rhymed verse directly into the camera , recounting the advice handed down to him when he was a lad : ' Never steal anything . ' ' Never steal ANYTHING ? ' asks an incredulous offstage chorus . ' Never steal anything SMALL , ' amends Cagney , and we're off to a promising start . . . but the promise ( and the premise ) are never fulfilled . There are only about three full-fledged musical numbers in the entire movie . One of them , intended to be a satire on TV commercials , is a too-long advertisement for a dishwashing detergent with the unlikely name ' Love ' , performed by the annoying Shirley Jones . I've never understood the appeal of Shirley Jones , and I find her even less appealing nowadays ( I'm writing this in 2003 ) when she looks like an older version of Hillary Clinton ( another actress whose performances have never convinced me ) . Shirley Jones did have a good coloratura singing voice , but her big ' Love ' number in this movie is written to be chanted rather than sung , so it minimises her genuine vocal talent . The best number in this film ( which isn't saying much ) is a peppy novelty song called ' I'm Sorry , I Want a Ferrari ' , performed by Cara Williams and Cagney . We know ( from his previous films ) that Cagney's a great song-and-dance man , so we really want to see him cut loose with some hoofing in this movie . . . but he never does it . The closest Cagney comes to dancing is in the ' Ferrari ' number , when he struts along a conveyor belt with Cara Williams ( who , like Jones , also fails to convey any appeal to me ) . I enjoy musicals , so it seldom bothers me when ' normal ' people on screen suddenly burst into song and dance . But in ' Never Steal Anything Small ' , the musical numbers are so few and far between that we can never really accept this movie as a musical . Consequently , when the characters occasionally DO break into song ( after long stretches of straight dialogue ) , the transition is jarring . I was delighted when I saw Charles Lederer credited with the screenplay for this movie . Lederer was one of the great wisecrackers of Hollywood's golden age , an iconoclast who knew everyone and had plenty to say . He was also the nephew of Marion Davies , which gave him permanent entree into William Randolph Hearst's estate at San Simeon . ( Lederer was the one who tipped off Hearst that Orson Welles was making a movie about a guy named Citizen Kane who bore an unflattering resemblance to Hearst . ) I was well and truly hoping that ' Never Steal Anything Small ' would be full of Lederer's vintage wisecracks and some Hecht / MacArthur-style dialogue , but I was disappointed . Most annoying of all is this film's immoral viewpoint . Cagney's character ( a big shot in the longshoremen's union ) is flagrantly corrupt , but we're expected to cheer him onward because he's a lovable rogue with a line of blarney . Cagney's opponent here is an honest attorney ( played by Roger Smith , who previously played Cagney's son in ' Man of a Thousand Faces ' ) . The attorney is a colourless cipher , clearly meant to be less sympathetic than Cagney's charming crook . Smith gives a bland performance as the attorney : he was a dull actor , who later had better success managing the career of his wife Ann-Margret . What hurts is that ' Never Steal Anything Small ' has many enjoyable moments . The few musical numbers are well-staged and well-written , making us wish for more . The lyrics are excellent . The dialogue and the comedy are amusing but not really up to what we should expect from Lederer . Sadly , I rate this movie . A pleasant time-passer , but it could have been a truly great film .
418830	1609079	33787	5.0	Scientific feats , do yo ' stuff !	' King of the Zombies ' is a low-budget horror movie with some intentional humour and rather too much UN-intentional humour . The leading players are best known for their performances as comic-strip characters : Joan Woodbury , extremely beautiful here , whose career peaked with the title role in the 1945 serial ' Brenda Starr , Reporter ' , and Dick Purcell , who did his own stunts as the title character in the 1944 serial ' Captain America ' and dropped dead of a coronary attack soon afterwards . They're joined here by Mantan Moreland , a black comedian whom I've always found hilarious , yet who is now unfairly linked with Stepin Fetchit and Willie Best as merely one more purveyor of Negro stereotypes . The main villain is played by Henry Victor , an Anglo-German actor who could have had a very successful Hollywood career if only he'd possessed better control over his accent . In some sequences of this movie , Victor sounds quite British , whilst in other scenes he sounds extremely German . With the exception of Lubitsch's ' To Be or Not to Be ' , in which Victor had a very small role as a Nazi soldier , I've noticed this problem in every film in which I've seen him . . . including ' Freaks ' , in which Henry Victor's astonishingly good performance as Hercules the strongman was marred by that wandering accent . In ' King of the Zombies ' ( playing the title role ) , Henry Victor gives one of his less impressive performances . His character here is named Sangre , which of course means ' Blood ' . I suppose any movie to do with zombies will have some racial stereotyping . This movie implies that blacks make better zombies than whites , and that blacks can be zombified more easily than whites . Madame Sul-Te-Wan , the underrated black actress , is effective in a small role here and manages to convey some racial dignity . The director of this film , Jean Yarbrough , has some extremely impressive credits : he worked with a lot of people whose work I admire and enjoy . But Yarbrough was consistently a very poor director : his work is always badly paced and unimaginative . In addition to the terrible movie ' Brute Man ' ( Rondo Hatton's star vehicle ) , Jean Yarbrough also directed several episodes of Abbott & Costello's TV show . . . but Yarbrough's episodes are consistently the worst and dullest episodes of Bud & Lou's series . Yarbrough's best film was probably ' Master Minds ' , a Bowery Boys movie . Amazingly , ' King of the Zombies ' was nominated for an Academy Award . The moody and unusual musical score by Edward J . Kay got a nomination : it's not an especially good score , though . Kay was a former dentist ; when I hear the music from this film , I wonder if Kay composed his melodies on a dentist's air hose , like the musical dentist in ' Bells Are Ringing ' . This being a 1941 film , there's a vague attempt to make the movie ' relevant ' to current events with a wartime subplot : Dr Sangre is trying to use his zombies in a mind-swap experiment which will help him spy on the Allied powers . Just the idea of using Mantan Moreland in a mind-swap experiment is hilarious . ' King of the Zombies ' has some camp value , and I enjoy Mantan Moreland's performance . I'll rate this movie .
419162	1609079	28135	5.0	F . D . R . , don't quit your day job . . .	" The President's Mystery " isn't really a mystery , but it's a well-made B-picture with an interesting premise . President Franklin D . Roosevelt was fond of reading murder mysteries . On 12 May 1935 , at a White House luncheon , FDR offered his lunch guests an idea for a mystery : How could a millionaire disappear and start a new life for himself , under a new identity , yet manage to take his wealth with him ? One of the guests at that luncheon was magazine editor Fulton Oursler , who wrote mystery stories under the pseudonym ' Anthony Abbot ' . Intrigued by FDR's idea , Oursler contacted five other authors ( including S . S . Van Dine , creator of the popular Philo Vance mysteries ) , and they set out to write a novel that could answer FDR's question . This was published as " The President's Mystery Story " , with FDR listed as co-author ( although he contributed only the premise ) . It is not a very good book , due to its patchwork structure : the various chapters are written by different authors of radically different styles and widely varying talent . But largely due to its novelty appeal and FDR's personal popularity , " The President's Mystery Story " became a best-seller . This movie is the film version , with a title card in the opening credits explaining FDR's participation . The screenplay was written by Lester Cole and the grossly overrated Nathanael West , who brings none of his own sardonic viewpoint to this movie . Industrialist James Blake ( the underrated actor Henry Wilcoxon , who later submerged his career into C . B . DeMille's ) has messed up his personal life and he wants to start over in a new identity . . . but he doesn't want to lose the fortune he's already compiled . He hits upon a very clever plan which might actually have worked in the 1930s , but which nowadays ( with computer databases and biometric I . D . ) couldn't possibly succeed . Blake locates a crooked investment firm run by two con men ( one of them is played by Charles Williams , the meek little actor who played Eustace Bailey in " It's a Wonderful Life " ) . Claiming to have enough evidence to put the crooks in prison , Blake bullies them into abandoning their investment firm without dismantling it . Blake then secretly takes over the brokerage without any paperwork to document the transfer . Operating in the open , he then proceeds to invest his own fortune in the crooked brokerage house . . . thus neatly robbing himself ! ( But how does he withdraw the money after he deposits his cheques ? ) Because Blake is publicly perceived to lose his fortune , nobody is surprised when he vanishes . . . an apparent suicide . He establishes a new identity with plausible ease ( again , this was before high-tech I . D . ) and it looks like he's accomplished his goal . But then something goes wrong . . . There are several good performances here , most notably Wilcoxon's , Sidney Blackmer's and a comic turn by Barnett Parker in his usual silly-ass Englishman mode , and a performance by the underrated John Wray . Byron Foulger gives his usual inept performance as a milquetoast . Betty Furness is dull and unattractive , as usual for her . I'll rate this movie . FDR's participation is almost nonexistent , and co-screenwriter Nathanael West's influence on the material is minor . But this modest film has some genuine merits and an unusual story ; I recommend it .
419106	1609079	408516	5.0	England's Abbott & Costello	The cross-talk comedy team of Jewel & Warriss were Britain's version of Abbott & Costello . Both teams featured a well-dressed straight-man who easily exploited and baffled an ill-dressed bumbler . Whereas Bud Abbott was dapper , his counterpart Ben Warriss onstage typically dressed as if he was on his way to a Coronation , in high silk hat , spats , walking stick and formal attire . Coarse-featured Jimmy Jewel was neither as short nor as fat as Lou Costello , but strongly resembled him in an ill-fitting suit , porkpie hat and a broad ' kipper ' tie . Although the career of Jewel & Warriss peaked at almost exactly the same time as Bud & Lou reached their zenith , Jewel & Warriss are now almost utterly forgotten because their greatest popularity was on stage in the variety halls . Their film and television appearances were few , usually limited to cameo appearances in someone else's show . They also starred in ' Up the Pole ' - a bizarre radio sitcom , taking place at the North Pole - but this radio series inevitably lacks the visual appeal of their material . The real-life behaviour of Jewel & Warriss differed sharply from their onstage personalities . Jimmy Jewel , gullible and gormless onstage , was actually a shrewd man who invested his money wisely . Ben Warriss , the glib sharpie onstage , was actually a clothes-horse who spent his money as fast as he earned it . " I'll have a new suit made for that , " was his first response to every cross-talk routine they added to their act . Interestingly , Jewel and Warriss were actually cousins , born in the same bed ( a few months apart ) and raised together in one household . ' At Home with Jimmy and Ben ' enhances the similarity of Jewel & Warriss to Abbott & Costello by employing the same gimmick previously used by Bud & Lou in their TV series . The lads are using their own names here , playing fictionalised versions of themselves , and ostensibly living together in an odd-couple arrangement . ' At Home with Jimmy and Ben ' is a one-off post-holiday special for the lads , transmitted 24 January 1962 . On Britain's TV screens , Christmas and Boxing Day are traditionally excuses for elaborate holiday specials . Apparently , Jewel & Warriss couldn't ( or didn't want to ) get this 15-minute skit scheduled during the holiday season , so they waited three weeks and shaped their material accordingly . This special depicts Jimmy and Ben living together , spending a lazy evening at home whilst recovering from the overindulgence of the recent holiday season . Naturally , Ben takes advantage of gullible Jimmy , and soon Jimmy is fetching and carrying whilst Ben nurses a hangover . The comedy seems forced . Allegedly , we're watching these two performers on their night off , when they're simply lolling about at home and being themselves . . . yet we're aware that this is really a set in a television studio , and that these two performers are speaking rehearsed dialogue . Jewel & Warriss lounge about the set in house clothes , thereby losing a major part of their distinctive image - Warriss's formal attire , Jewel's incongruous suit - and diluting the contrast between their appearances . Most comedy duos featured a little and a large , or a fat and a thin . Jewel & Warriss were of normal size and shape ; when dressed normally , the most significant contrast between them was facial : Ben is handsome , Jimmy has a face like a sack of potatoes . I'm not quite old enough to have seen Jewel & Warriss live onstage in the variety halls , when they ( and their act ) were in their prime . A few old-timers who did see them onstage have told me that Jewel & Warriss's television work ( including this special ) is simply not an accurate reflection of the act's appeal . At their peak , Jewel & Warriss were a fast-paced turn , with rapid-fire cross-talk and gags , performing in a style far more typical of American vaudeville comics rather than British music-hall comedians . Very little of that zip is on offer here . What does come through , pleasingly , is the very real affection and chemistry between these cousins who have literally been together from the cradle . ( Reportedly , in their last years together , spendthrift Ben came to resent Jimmy's comfortable financial situation . ) For that one glimpse of their past greatness , and the tremendous historical significance of their cross-talk act - Jewel & Warriss were top of the bill , during the war years - I'll rate this creaky special .
418382	1609079	27458	5.0	Don't come any closer , folks .	Despite a well-deserved Oscar for his performance in ' A Tree Grows in Brooklyn ' , James Dunn is now almost entirely forgotten . Not quite a romantic leading man , not quite a character actor , Dunn was a downmarket version of Lee Tracy ( another actor unjustly forgotten ) . I always enjoy Dunn on screen , but ' Come Closer , Folks ' is one of his weaker efforts . A lacklustre script by hack author Aben Kandel combined with catatonic direction by ' Dross ' Lederman ( an even worse hack than Kandel ) manage to scupper this project quite thoroughly . SLIGHT SPOILERS . Dunn plays a pavement pitchman who brings his keester into Stone City , Pennsylvania . . . largely because he's been chased out of everyplace else . He crosses paths with Marian Marsh , cast as the prim daughter of the local department-store magnate . I fondly remember Marsh for her very sexy performance as Trilby in ' Svengali ' , but a lot of her sex appeal in that film was down to the beautiful wig she wore . In ' Come Closer , Folks ' , Marsh has much shorter hair , and she makes her first appearance in eyeglasses . . . so we know this is going to be one of those movies in which the prim spinster loses her inhibitions when she loses her glasses . Sure enough . A few familiar character actors are on hand here - - Harry Depp , Herman Bing ( more tangle-tongued than usual ) , Gene Lockhart as Marsh's dyspeptic father - - but offering absolutely nothing that they haven't done better in a dozen better movies . Viewers who recognise these faces from other films will see them do exactly what's expected here . . . and nothing more than the expected . One face that was unfamiliar to me here was that of obscure actor George McKay , who gave a fresh turn as a local yokel fleeced by the fast-talking Dunn . Eventually , Dunn and Marsh take over Lockhart's department store , and - - of course - - they turn it into a going concern . Dunn's character in this movie is a dodgy drifter , so I found it contrived that he would become successful as soon as a woman takes an interest in him . Purely on the strength of James Dunn's forceful personality , and George McKay's performance , I'll rate this movie .
418837	1609079	127544	5.0	At least three versions exist .	I saw ' Evangeliemandens liv ' at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy , where it was screened with three different endings . Speaking of which : several Internet bloggers ( mostly in the U . S . A . ) have questioned the accuracy of some of my IMDb reviews , claiming discrepancies between my plot synopses and the content of the movies . What those bloggers don't realise ( or what they DO realise but they don't want to acknowledge ) is that a movie sometimes exists in several different versions . This is particularly the case for silent movies released in several different languages : sometimes the person who translated the intertitles would also change the names of major characters , and change the content of the text in the titles and dialogue . When Hollywood silents were distributed in Europe , it was not unusual for the footage to be re-edited , with new titles inserted , altering the film's plot to suit the tastes of a different culture . This practice continued into the talkies era : for example , British prints of the Marx Brothers movie ' Horse Feathers ' contain a scene between Thelma Todd and Harpo which doesn't exist in any Stateside print I've seen . My detractors are looking at U . S . prints of these silents , while I'm usually screening European or British prints , which can be significantly different . ' Evangeliemandens liv ' ( " Evangelist's Life " ) begins very promisingly and imaginatively . We see popular Danish leading man Valdemar Psilander ( as himself ) sitting in a darkened set , reading a copy of this film's screenplay . Against a hazy background appear three images of John Redmond ( Psilander's role in this film ) in the three roles that he will fulfil in this story : playboy , convict , evangelist . It's a striking image , and a powerful opening scene . Too bad the film is downhill from here . Handsome young Billy Sanders ( Birger von Cotta-Schønberg ) is drifting into a life of crime , leading to quarrels with his girlfriend Nelly Gray ( Alma Hinding , a pretty brunette ) . Wise older man Redmond , now a lay preacher , proceeds to caution Billy by relating his own life story . Unfortunately , most of this movie's running time is taken up with Redmond's unwieldy flashback . Redmond ( looking no younger in the flashback ) was once a wealthy playboy , in love with the town slut ( Else Froehlich , quite sexy ) but jealous of her many other lovers . During an argument with one of these men , Redmond pulled a revolver and accidentally killed the woman they were fighting over . For this , Redmond served a long prison sentence ; while in Danish porridge , he found religion with the help of the prison chaplain ( Frederik Jacobsen , a dull performance ) . SPOILERS NOW . ' Evangeliemandens liv ' was a Danish film intended primarily for domestic audiences , so the ending released in Denmark would be the ' official ' ending . In that version , Billy sees the error of his ways , and he and Nelly are tearfully reunited while Redmond beams approval . However , this movie was released to foreign markets with two other endings . In the Russian version , Nelly decides to commit suicide . She fashions a noose ; in close-up , we see the arousal in her eyes as she embraces the noose lovingly . Then she hangs herself . The End . In the Swedish version , Nelly again fashions the noose ; again , she seems to arouse herself as she embraces it . She climbs onto a chair , kicks it away . . . just as Billy and Redmond burst into her room . Redmond unpockets a penknife , cuts the rope , tosses his knife aside while Billy helps Nelly onto the bed . Redmond raises his eyes heavenward , giving thanks that Nelly will live . I find these alternate endings interesting for what they reveal about the expectations of different film audiences . Apparently , Russian movie audiences in 1915 didn't want happy endings . Also apparently , Swedish audiences DID want happy endings . . . but only providing that the girl suffer first , and nearly kill herself . Also , I'm intrigued ( but not surprised ) that all three versions of this movie take a misogynist view : when a young couple quarrel over the boy's criminal propensities , it's clearly the duty of the girl - - not the boy - - to end the relationship by committing suicide . Oh , blimey ! ' Evangeliemandens liv ' is extremely well-photographed , and the prison sequences are quite realistic . Most of the actors give performances more subtle than I would have expected . But the pace of this film is leaden and stodgy , and the flashback structure is extremely unwieldy . My rating for this movie : , no matter which ending you see .
418219	1609079	21360	5.0	Whiney Winnie warbles wanly .	I always find it distracting when a character in a movie or TV programme has the same name as the actor playing that character . ' She Couldn't Say No ' stars an actress named Winnie as a woman named Winnie : an unnecessary contrivance . Perhaps Warner Brothers were trying to build up Winnie Lightner for the star treatment . A few months after making this movie , Lightner starred for Warners in ' Sit Tight ' , in which she again played a character cried Winnie . Wild Winnie Harper ( Lightner ) is a nightclub chantoozey who attracts the attention of Jerry Casey ( Chester Morris ) . Now get this : Casey is a gangster , but he allegedly wants to go straight . He decides to groom Harper for stardom , envisioning a new ' legit ' career for himself as her manager . So far , so cliché . . . but at this point the movie takes an unexpected turn . The rules of bad scriptwriting require Casey and Harper to fall in love , but for Harper to be dismayed by Casey's criminal behaviour . SPOILERS COMING NOW . Sure enough , she falls for him . But , surprisingly , Casey has the ga-ga's for Iris , a hoity-toity society girl . ( Sally Eilers is very weak in this role . ) Also surprisingly , Casey genuinely does intend to go straight , rather than making empty promises . Winnie Lightner wallows in some of Alice Faye's masochism as Winnie Harper nobly steps aside . Then Casey gets shot dead by one of his underworld cronies . . . and it turns out that he actually loved Harper all along , but didn't think he was good enough for her . ( Oh , but he's good enough for that rich society dame . ) Along the way , we get dialogue like ' You're making mud pies of my heart . ' This movie reminds me of several other movies , but in every case the other movie is preferable . The directing , editing , production design and camera work are all consistent with Warners ' B-unit . Chester Morris was an underrated actor who usually impressed me , but here he seems merely to be going through the motions . I'll rate ' She Couldn't Say No ' .
419600	1609079	433326	6.0	Too long in the oolong .	The Prince Street Players were a Manhattan children's-theatre troupe ( of adult actors ) staging musical versions of traditional fairy tales , with scripts and songs written by Jim Eiler . Eiler's scripts tended to be straightforward retellings of the beloved classics , with very little modernisation or topical humour . ( Unilike the panto versions that are popular in Britain , which insert modern references and comic business into the stories . ) The troupe featured talented and personable performers , but the strongest asset of the Prince Street Players was the musical talent of Jim Eiler , who wrote catchy melodies and deft lyrics for many of their shows . Most American versions of ' Aladdin ' ( including the Disney movie ) set the action in Arabia , whilst British stagings move the action to China . . . often featuring comic-relief characters such as Wishy Washy ( the Chinese laundryman ) and Widow Twanky ( an old woman played by a male comedian ) . This Prince Street Players production adheres to the classical story but takes place in China , relying on classical stagecraft of the Chinese theatre . A stage manager ( Don Liberto ) appears onstage in Chinese costume , moving props and Chinoiserie scenery in full view of the audience . None of the actors employ Chinese acting techniques . . . which may be a wise decision for the sake of American television audiences . As Aladdin , Fred Grades sings well but gives a lacklustre performance . Far more appealing is Vicki Morales as Princess Mei Ling : she shows real presence , and has a singing voice of crystalline beauty . But the real star of this production is Will B . Able as the Genie of the Lamp . ( I once met Will B . Able ; yes , that's his real name , and he kept a copy of his birth certificate handy in case anybody doubted him . ) Able's performance in this role is slightly effeminate , but - - as this production is intended for children , and entirely suitable for young audiences - - I doubt that any subtext was intended . Able skilfully sets the pace for the other actors , magically apporting objects and transporting Aladdin and the princess through their adventures . The hallmarks of all the Prince Street Players productions are the delightful music and inventive lyrics by Jim Eiler . In ' Aladdin ' , Eiler's score falls short of the high standard he achieved in ' The Emperor's New Clothes ' , but the melodies are still pleasant . The lyrics , alas , are somewhat repetitive . . . and less imaginative than usual for Eiler . When the Genie introduces himself by singing ' I am a genie : a good genie , not a meanie ' , this is Aladdin's cue to turn towards the audience and sing ' He is a genie : a good genie , not a meanie ' . Eiler commendably attempts to give his score a Chinese motif , but most of these pentatonic melodies end up sounding like the ying-tong stereotype of ' Chinese-ish ' music . When Princess Mei Ling offers some poisoned oolong to the villain , she sings ' Teatime , teatime , time to poison HE time ' . This is the villain's cue to face the audience and sing ' Teatime , teatime . She wants to poison ME time . ' Ah , so ! Me velly solly ! The most energetic number in this show , and also the one with the best ( and least Oriental ) melody , is the one with the worst and most repetitive lyric . Aladdin and Mei Ling are far from home , and anxious to return . When Aladdin commands the Genie to muster his magic to whisk them across the vast distance , this is the cue for all three performers to rush about singing ' Up , up , up so high ! We'll be home ! In the wink ! Of an eye ! ' So far , so catchy . . . except that they CONTINUE to sing this couplet , over and over and over , with no variations , while they rush upstage and downstage for several minutes with nary a scenery change . ( UPDATE : I've been contacted by someone who claims that my memory of this lyric is inaccurate ; maybe so , but it certainly does SEEM repetitive . ) Eventually , the Genie runs directly up to the camera until he has one eye in tight close-up - - I commend the camera operator for maintaining focus - - and then he ostentatiously winks . I well and truly dislike musical numbers in which the characters sing about how they're in a big hurry to go someplace . . . while they stay here and sing about how they're in a big hurry to go someplace . Despite my cavils , this is a delightful and ( largely ) imaginative production which children and non-jaded adults will enjoy . If I seem to be harsh to ' Aladdin ' , it's only because I've been spoilt by the high quality of the Prince Street Players ' production of ' The Emperor's New Clothes ' ( with Eiler's brilliant score ) and ' Jack and the Beanstalk ' . This ' Aladdin ' falls far short of those two musicals , but it's still much better than most of the stuff your kids could be watching . I'll rate this ' Aladdin ' .
418883	1609079	11263	6.0	Racist but funny anyway	' Haunted Spooks ' , starring Harold Lloyd , was midway through its shooting schedule when Lloyd suffered the bizarre accident which crippled him for life . As a publicity gag , he posed for a photo with a prop bomb of the classic ' bowling-ball ' style so popular among movie anarchists : the bomb's fuse was lit , and Harold held the bomb near his face so he could light his cigarette . By a fluke , somebody spoke to him and he lowered the bomb to reply . . . just before the ' prop ' bomb exploded . It was a real bomb , which somebody had ordered from a props agency to use for a picnic . ( Must have been quite a picnic ! ) When the bomb went unused , it was stupidly returned to inventory among some ' dud ' bombs which had been made as genuine props . If Lloyd hadn't lowered the bomb from his face , his movie career ( and his life ) would have ended right there . Lloyd lost the thumb and forefinger of his right hand ( he was right-handed ) and was temporarily blinded in his right eye . Production on ' Haunted Spooks ' was halted until he returned from hospital wearing a latex glove with a false thumb and finger ( moulded from a reverse casting of his left hand ) . The suicide sequences at the beginning of ' Haunted Spooks ' are the last footage of Lloyd with his intact right hand . The haunted-house sequences later in this movie ( and all of his subsequent films ) feature him with his prosthetic glove . It's amazing to realise that Lloyd performed the stunts in all of his ' thrill ' comedies ( including his climb up a skyscraper in ' Safety Last ' and his climb down another skyscraper in ' Feet First ' ) with a maimed hand . In the 1950s , Jack Benny ( unaware of Lloyd's handicap ) invited him to guest on Benny's TV show : Lloyd declined , as his latex prosthesis had long since rotted . SPOILERS FOR SOME OF THE GAGS . The opening sequence of ' Haunted Spooks ' is very funny . Lloyd plays a young man who has been disappointed in love , and is now determined to kill himself . Finding a pistol in the street , he shoots himself in the head but gets only a faceful of water : it was a squirt pistol . Deciding to jump off a bridge into a lake , he clambers over the rail , and is about to jump when suddenly a stranger intercedes . But the stranger only wants to know what time it is . Lloyd hands the fellow his watch and tells him to keep it . Then Lloyd jumps off the bridge . . . into a few inches of water . These gags are very funny on their own merit , but they have a morbid edge for viewers who are aware that Lloyd very soon would narrowly escape a real-life death . The second half of ' Haunted Spooks ' is much more contrived , and also extremely racist . I should warn you that the title of this movie is meant to be a racial pun : ' spooks ' being a 1920s slang term for Negroes . Lloyd has to spend the night in a creepy old house which , in Scooby-Doo fashion , is haunted by some fake ghosts . Lloyd gets rather frightened : there's one bizarre shot of Lloyd in a fright wig which stands out from his head like a 1970s Afro . Speaking of Afros : the haunted house is full of stereotypical black characters who ( of course ) are even more cowardly than Lloyd . There's one outrageous shot depicting a roomful of frightened blacks , all of them quivering in fear with their knees knocking in perfect unison . Yassuh ! The immensely talented black child actor Ernie Morrison ( who was usually billed as ' Sunshine Sammy ' ) provides one very funny gag among the racial stereotypes . Morrison was about seven years old at the time , and short with it . At one point in the haunted house , little Morrison falls into an adult-sized pair of trousers which are taller than he is . Instead of climbing out of the trousers , Morrison stumbles blindly about the house , with his legs in the trouser legs and the rest of his body inside the crutch of the trousers . This looks like a pair of trousers going walkies with nobody inside them . Of course , everybody who sees this immediately gets frightened . ' Haunted Spooks ' contains some fairly mean-spirited humour ( including its title ) at the expense of black people , but some of the gags are so inventive that I laughed anyway . . . and the opening suicide sequence is first-rate black comedy in the non-racial sense of the term . I'll rate this comedy .
418591	1609079	100965	6.0	The bang-bang gang	Richard Kern was an underground filmmaker who specialised in transgressive themes , and images that are violent and erotic at the same go . Like Kenneth Anger , who seems to have been an influence on him , Kern is less interested in coherent narrative than in presenting themes and images that will provoke us , shock us and . . . possibly . . . arouse us . " X is Y " is a very short film , consisting of images of young women handling automatic handguns and rifles . The women's physical appearances and the overall direction are clearly intended to eroticise the firearms whilst emphasising the phallic aspect of the weapons . The film's title is not explained , but it apparently has a genetic basis : X is the female chromosome and Y the male chromosome . Apparently , Kern is suggesting that handguns are ' supposed to be ' male objects , yet here are these very sexy and unquestionably female women engaged in the ' male ' activities of gun-love and shooting . " X is Y " features some thrash music by a band with the appropriate name Cop Shoot Cop . Kern shows some genuine directorial talent within his narrow self-appointed genre , and the women in this movie are very delightful to look at . I'll rate this quickie .
419566	1609079	392770	6.0	Tap-dancer Mahoney is the transition between Ray Bolger and Ann Miller .	American performers Will Mahoney and his wife Evie Hayes were very popular in Australia , where I was raised : they were slightly before my time , but I've met several old-time Aussies who spoke very fondly of seeing Mahoney or Hayes ( or both ) in live performances . Will Mahoney had some success in vaudeville as an eccentric dancer . His speciality was his dazzlingly proficient nerve taps , done with his right foot only . I'm not aware of anyone who did better nerve taps than Mahoney until Ann Miller came along : she could do nerve taps with BOTH feet , and she contrasted these with her sex appeal . Mahoney , lacking sex appeal , had to integrate his nerve taps with comedy material similar to Ray Bolger's , in which he pretends to miss a step and loses his balance . But Ray Bolger would skilfully recover his balance and go on to the next part of his routine ( a much more impressive recovery ) , whilst Mahoney ( as seen in this film ) would do a clumsy pratfall , losing the pace of his routine while he got up and started dancing again . This is one of those mini-musicals with a vague attempt at a plot . In 1934 , the vogue for hillbilly musicians was ending and the vogue for Hawaiian musicians was starting , so I laughed at a gag here featuring a hillbilly ensemble called the Mountain Melodeers . Told that Hawaiian musicians are more popular , they start playing their bass and banjo on the high frets to sound like ukeleles . I could have altogether done without the Five Spirits of Harmony , a quintet of annoying little black children who sing a-capella and talk in annoying " darky " dialect . One of them keeps kissing a boy who clearly doesn't want to be kissed . Elsewhere , we briefly see two blonde girls who dance time steps on roller skates and do hitch kicks and airplane steps without the skates . I wanted to see more of their act , instead of all the screen time given to those black " chillun " . Al Christie's Educational studio was bottom of the barrel , so I was intrigued by an attempt here to dress up some stock footage of ocean liners with a series of optical-wipe transitions , with the wipes oddly in the shape of an inverted triangle . The stupid plot has Mahoney stealing another man's name , then - - when the other man turns out to be a wanted criminal - - he has to prove he's no phony-baloney Mahoney by doing his vaudeville act . This all turns out to be part of his Jewish agent's scheme to get him to perform on a cruise . Oy vey ! My rating for this one : , and Mahoney is especially endearing while performing the title song ( although he swallows his lyrics ) . In a small role , Marion Martin is just a wee bit too sexy to be plausible .
419176	1609079	1059272	6.0	I only saw the top half of this movie !	I saw this early U . S . ( Paramount ) sound short in 1990 , at a meeting of a film society in s'Gravenhage : most of the film society's members were from Holland or the Low Countries . One Benelux gentleman had a print of this film with the original American soundtrack , but with extremely obtrusive subtitles ( in French ) dominating the lower half of the screen and blotting out much of the image . The subtitles were actually so distracting that , after a minute or so , I put a business card in front of my face to block out the lower part of the screen ! Fortunately , most of the humour in ' If Men Played Cards As Women Do ' comes from the dialogue and its delivery , rather than anything actually happening on the screen , so I still got a fair notion of the actors ' performances . Unfortunately , this same print also had the front and end credits ( and their original leaders ) cut off ; the end credits ( if there ever were any ) had been replaced with a newer piece of leader stock . More annoyingly , the opening credits were entirely gone and replaced with a leader strip which simply gave this film's title translated into French . No cast list , no production credits , nowt . Was there ever a cast list in the first place ? ( IMDb don't list one . ) Watching this 1929 film , I had a deja-viewish feeling that I ought to recognise a couple of the American actors , but so far no pennies have dropped . The four men in this film address each other by forenames , but these are clearly the names of their roles . The sound recording was bad ( no surprise for 1929 Paramount ) , and the print I viewed ( an acetate dupe ) was dark , so the actors ' voices and faces were unrecognisable to me . For what it's worth , I suspect that this short movie was filmed at Paramount's east-coast studio in Astoria , NY , rather than in Hollywood . The 1942 flag-waving musical ' Star Spangled Rhythm ' ( also from Paramount ) contains a sketch with the same title as this short movie : in that version , Ray Milland , Fred MacMurray , Franchot Tone and ( male ) character actor Lynne Overman play themselves performing this material as a skit . Apart from the casting , the two versions have two major differences : the actors in this 1929 short have much better timing and delivery than those old pros in the ' 42 version , and the 1929 version has a radically different ending . For both of these reasons , the 1929 version is funnier . ( I enjoyed ' Star-Spangled Rhythm ' for several reasons , but not for this particular sketch . . . the most protracted and least funny longueur in the entire film . ) From here onward , my review refers to the ' 29 version . A tired businessman ( that's how he's dressed , at least ) invites three of his mates over for a game of cards . But instead of a straightforward card game , they indulge in all the various diversions and distractions that are more typical of women's cardplaying . The joke - - and it's a VERY funny joke , when performed properly ( as it is in the ' 29 version , unlike the ' 42 version ) - - is that the men look , act and speak like regular blokes : they are not in any way effeminate . The title is accurate : this is not what life would be like if men acted like women , but rather if men played CARDS like women . During their cardplay , one man admires another man's hat - - a perfectly normal trilby - - so the man wearing it offers to let the admirer try it on ; the latter eagerly accepts . One man can't remember the difference between spades and clubs , so he shows his hand to the man next to him ( an opponent ) , who plays fair by showing HIS hand to point out which suit is which . All four men chatter away about trivialities completely unrelated to the game , and also unrelated to any of the important subjects men actually talk about during card games ( in descending order of importance ) : Politics , Business , Sex and Sport . SPOILER NOW . The 1942 version of this skit ended with a mouse entering the room , prompting all four men to jump onto the table and lift their trouser turn-ups . I found that gag stupid and contrived . . . especially since I've seen plenty of real-life WOMEN reacting to mice and other vermin , and not one of them ever did the " eek-a-mouse " routine that Fred MacMurray did in ' Star-Spangled Rhythm ' . This 1929 short , conversely , ends with one of the cardplayers gossiping that another ( male ) friend absent from the game is ' expecting ' a baby . . . presumably with the aid of his wife . When the cardplayers realise that the expectant friend has only recently got married , they all gleefully throw down their cards and start counting the months . . . calculating whether the friend will have been married for a full nine months before the baby arrives . Hoo boy . I found this ending more plausible than the one in ' Star-Spangled Rhythm ' , not to say funnier , but it's very much an anticlimax compared to the very effective underplaying of the actors in the rest of this skit . The film's direction ( by Joseph Santley , according to IMDb ) is brisk and efficient : I certainly wish I could verify Santley's participation from this film's opening credits , but the French print didn't have any . ' If Men Played Cards As Women Do ' ranks as one of those notions for which the basic idea is funnier than the execution . This material wants a really good punchline , and neither of these two film versions supplies it . Maybe I'm being ungenerous because I only saw the upper half of this movie , trying to block out those annoying subtitles in the lower half . My rating for this 1929 short : .
419225	1609079	30186	6.0	Joe E . Brown as Clark Kent	' The Gladiator ' , by Philip Wylie , was a serious science-fiction novel about a man who is scientifically enhanced with superhuman powers . Although a minor novel , Wylie's book is extremely significant because it inspired two teenagers from Cleveland named Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to create their comic-book character Superman . The 1938 movie ' The Gladiator ' ( released barely two months after Superman's comic-book debut ) is ostensibly based on Wylie's deadpan novel , but the original premise has been drastically rewritten as a comedy vehicle for Joe E . Brown . Given the strange decision to play this story for laughs , Brown is an excellent choice for the role . Joe E . Brown had a great deal in common with Buster Keaton , beyond the fact that they both had a drinking problem which led to both of them ( consecutively ) falling into the clutches of the same woman : a detox-ward nurse named Mae Scrivens . Keaton and Brown were both Midwesterners who performed professionally from early childhood . Both were small men who looked like weaklings , but both were actually acrobats with prodigious physical strength . On screen , Joe E . Brown often played ineffectual men . . . so the effect was startling when he would suddenly execute a cartwheel or some other acrobatic stunt . In vaudeville , Brown worked with the professional wrestler Man Mountain Dean in a stage act in which little Joe E . would lift the huge Man Mountain over his head with only one hand . This stunt was absolutely genuine , with nothing faked . Brown repeats it in this movie , with Man Mountain Dean playing himself . . . but because this is a movie , audiences will assume there must be some sort of trickery going on . The biggest difference between Keaton and Brown on screen is that Keaton was resolutely unsentimental , whereas Joe E . Brown was usually much TOO sentimental . In a blatant bid for audience sympathy , Joe E . starts this movie in a hospital ward , where he is telling bedtime stories to little crippled boys ! Soon afterwards he is sent on an errand which requires him to enter a cinema . . . but the movie house is holding Bank Night , and Joe E . accidentally wins $1 , 500 . ( Nowadays nobody knows what Bank Night is . ) Apparently $1 , 500 is enough money in 1938 to buy a college education , so Joe E . straightaway enrols in college . . . hoping to get an education so he can earn lots of money and adopt crippled orphan Dickie Moore . ( Full disclosure : I interviewed the grown-up Moore several years ago , while he was running a publicity agency in New York City . He's a fine man and is very embarrassed by some of his child-actor performances . ) On campus , Joe E . meets a crazy scientist ( played by the brilliant character actor Lucien Littlefield , who also played the mad scientist in Laurel and Hardy's ' Dirty Work ' ) . Littlefield has invented a super-serum , which he injects into a monkey , causing the monkey to act like a gorilla . While Joe E . is asleep , Littlefield jabs him with the super-soup . Joe E . wakes up with super-powers , and with no idea how he got them . When a college student wakes up with super-powers that could be used for the benefit of all humanity , of course he has to try out for Varsity . Soon Joe E . is the big man on campus , winning letters in every known sport . Bland actress June Travis plays a pretty co-ed who dislikes Joe E . but is persuaded to pretend to like him for the good of the team . ( Later , of course , her phony feelings become genuine . . . ) SLIGHT SPOILERS NOW . There are some funny sequences in which the befuddled Joe E . shows off his newfound super-strength , and Joe E . Brown's genuine athleticism ( in a seemingly unathletic body ) is shown to fine advantage here . The funniest moment comes during a wrestling match with Man Mountain Dean , when Joe E . ' s super-strength suddenly wears off at the worst possible moment . ' The Gladiator ' is a good film , not a great one , and I'll rate it . Watching this movie , I wish that somebody had done a straight version of Philip Wylie's original novel , which made some intelligent observations . This movie replaces Wylie's themes with easy slapstick and cheap sentiment .
418280	1609079	22099	6.0	The one about the farmer's daughter .	' Lügen auf Rügen ' would roughly translate into English as ' Scams Out of Bamboozles ' . It's meant to be a light-hearted comedy . This film is somewhat idiotic , but - - in fairness - - it's no worse in this respect than a lot of Hollywood and British films of the same period . The attractive Maria Solveg plays a farmer's daughter named Vanda Bilt . Can you see where this is heading ? When her photograph is chosen in a contest for a toothpaste advertisement , she wins a holiday at a resort on the Baltic Sea . Fräulein Bilt's accommodations at a seaside boarding-house are arranged . So far , so good . Now it gets contrived . The landlady of the resort hotel receives a ' phone call , telling her to expect the arrival of ' das Fräulein Vanda Bilt ' . The landlady misinterprets this as ' das Fräulein Vanderbilt ' , and she assumes that an American millionairess is arriving . Naturally , the landlady tells everyone else . Naturally , when Vanda arrives - - suspecting nothing - - everyone falls about giving her the royal treatment , which she assumes is part of her toothpaste prize . Nobody wonders why an American heiress speaks German with a Berlin accent ( which is inappropriate to Solveg's character , as she's playing a country girl ) . SPOILERS COMING . Eventually , she meets Paul Hörbiger , who is attracted to Vanda but ( thinking she's wealthy ) dares not make a move for fear of being perceived a fortune-hunter . Of course , once the truth comes out , there's no impediment to romance . And it's all due to toothpaste . This movie isn't as amusing as it thinks it is , but I did laugh at the antics of Ralph Arthur Roberts and Otto Wallburg as the partners in the toothpaste company . One of them is in charge of brushing the upper teeth , the other one brushes the lower teeth . ( No , I made that up . . . but it's as funny as anything in this movie . ) I'm intrigued that quite a few German movies of the early thirties - - another one is ' Ferien vom Ich ' , made in 1934 after Hitler's premiership had begun - - have plots involving American millionaires , and always treating Americans ( especially rich ones ) admiringly . Of course , Germany was struggling with terrible economic problems at this time ( one reason why Hitler's drastic policies were welcomed ) , and it's understandable that Germans would be attracted to wealth . Still , these German films seem genuinely to admire and appreciate Americans , rather than regarding them as fat pigeons for the Herrenvolk to pluck . I was in a good mood when I saw this mildly amusing film , and I'll rate ' Lügen auf Rügen ' .
418701	1609079	148319	6.0	Heckle & Jeckle meet Doctor Strangelove	With a title like ' Hula Hula Land ' , I was afraid that this Heckle and Jeckle cartoon would contain racial stereotypes of exotic " natives " . Fortunately , that isn't the case . ' Hula Hula Land ' contains nothing but wholesome hilarious violence . . . nothing remotely objectionable . The two magpies are hot-dog salesmen this time , and they set up their keester on a tropical beach . They charge ten cents for a hot dog ; I wonder if that was a fair price in 1949 , when this cartoon was made . Jeckle puts on a grass skirt and dances an alleged hula ( so he's a female impersonator , then ) while Heckle goes into his spiel . The weenies come alive and start moving about ; I found this gag distressing when Felix the Cat did it in ' April Maze ' ( 1930 ) and it's only slightly less distressing here . The Heckle & Jeckle toons were extremely variable , not only in their humour quotient but also in their production values . ' Hula Hula Land ' is one of the shoddier ones , and looks it . One animation sequence here - - the magpies ' exit from a bath-house , dressed in swimming cozzies - - was recycled from ' The Intruders ' ( 1947 ) , a much funnier and more elaborate toon in their series . The feathered chums soon attract the attention of that bulldog constable ( did he ever have a name ? ) and Dimwit , the dumb hound . We get a variation on a gag the Marx Brothers used in their film ' Go West ' : Heckle sells Dimwit a frankfurter with a string attached , so that he can snatch it back repeatedly . From here , we're into standard-issue Terrytoons violence , unfortunately more generic and less imaginative than usual . . . until the final gag . SPOILER NOW . The bulldog bombs the birds with an explosive so powerful , it raises a mushroom cloud ! I guess this was meant to be a topical tropical reference to the atomic-bomb tests which Uncle Sam was conducting on tropical atolls at this time . Fortunately , the fade-out shows that our magpie friends are still alive and well . ' Hula Hula Land ' is an amusing entry in their series , but no better than that . My rating : .
419166	1609079	8129	6.0	Eight cents a word ? O . Henry was dreaming !	SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . ' I Will Repay ' is adapted from O . Henry's short story ' A Municipal Report ' , but this film version makes some changes in the story which I consider largely improvements . In O . Henry's original , the ( unnamed ) narrator is mostly a passive observer : here , named Roger Kendall , he plays an active role in the proceedings and ends up in a romantic relationship with Virginia Rodney : the beauteous Corinne Griffith , playing a character who didn't even exist in the original story . Kendall , on the staff of a New York City magazine , has been sent to Nashville by his editor to offer a contract to one Azalea Adair , an unknown authoress . She turns out to be Southern gentility , living in genteel poverty and secretly supported by Caesar , a Negro coachman ( played by a white actor in blackface ) who was previously her family's property . But Miss Adair is also victimised by Steve , her late husband's son by a previous marriage , who bullies her into giving him any money that comes her way . The story ends happily , with Kendall signing Miss Adair to a contract at eight cents per word : an absolutely huge sum for an author in 1917 , as O . Henry could have testified had he not died in poverty seven years earlier . I will give the film-makers some credit for depicting the Negro character Caesar rather more sympathetically here than O . Henry treated him . My rating for this barely plausible but enjoyable yarn : .
418792	1609079	17870	7.0	Felix almost anticipates Hitchcock .	The title of this Felix toon is ' Woos Whoopee ' , which makes sense if you view a print with the original credits . Since Felix received star billing - - his name above the title - - the credits manage to read ' Felix the Cat Woos Whoopee ' . At this time , Felix the Cat was indeed a hugely popular box-office draw , fully deserving of star billing . Too bad he couldn't keep up with a certain mouse from a competing studio . As another reviewer has already noted , there's a Mrs Felix in this cartoon : a white cat . I find it a bit confusing when a cartoon character in a long-running series will acquire a wife or children ( or both ) to serve the plot of one particular toon , only for these relations to vanish without a trace afterward . This American cartoon was produced and released during Prohibition , so domestic audiences undoubtedly were highly amused by the sequences of Felix boozing it up with his cronies in some speakeasy . ( Can a silent film have a speakeasy ? ) Also , there's some clever animation in the depictions of the monsters Felix sees in the throes of his drunken trip home . One unfortunate trait of American comedy films ( toon and live-action ) during the Prohibition era was that they got very easy laughs just by mentioning or showing booze , and often the scriptwriters got lazy by relying too heavily on this device . ( Like all those 1970s comedies that got cheap laughs from jokes about marijuana . ) One sequence in ' Woos Whoopee ' intrigued me very much . . . then disappointed me . At one point , Felix moves so close to the camera that the black part of his head fills the entire frame . I expected this to become an ' invisible cut ' , the cinematic device later used by Hitchcock in ' Rope ' : the camera would pull back from Felix's black head to reveal that it had actually cut to an entirely different dark object . I was disappointed when this didn't happen , and the black object continued to be Felix . Oh , well . . . There are quite a few imaginative visual compositions in this short toon , very cleverly animated on a low budget . I didn't laugh at all during ' Woos Whoopee ' , but I did enjoy it . My rating : .
419085	1609079	19935	7.0	Lina Basquette , R . I . P .	" The Godless Girl " was one of Cecil B . DeMille's cynical attempts to combine sexual sensationalism with puritanical moralising . . . thus catering for movie audiences ' voyeurism while stroking their prejudices and allowing them to feel moral and pious . Many of DeMille's films offered this combination of sexual exploitation and fetishism in a moralistic framework . . . which explains why DeMille's movies almost invariably were huge hits at the box office . Lina Basquette ( dark-haired and very beautiful ) portrays Judy Craig , the leader of the Atheist Society , a radical students ' group . She is opposed by George Hathaway ( Tom Keene , too old for his role ) , the handsome leader of a club for church-going Christian students . The two factions clash on campus , and a girl is accidentally killed . ( There are two impressive elevator shots here , similar to a shot in Rene Clair's film ' Sous les Toits de Paris ' . ) The bitter rivals Judy and George , plus hapless scapegoat Samuel ' Bozo ' Johnson ( comic relief Eddie Quillan , who seems to be in an entirely different movie ) , are charged with manslaughter . Because they're minors , they're sentenced to the reformatory rather than prison . SLIGHT SPOILERS COMING . DeMille takes great delight in showing us Judy's degradation . We see long loving close-ups as Lina Basquette's beautiful long hair is clipped short for her entry into the Borstal . It's clear that DeMille is aroused by Judy's degradation , and that he expects us to feel the same way . Eventually , Judy and George ( former enemies ) manage to break out of the reformatory together and escape to a pastoral wilderness where they can start over as Eve and Adam in a new Eden . This was another recurring motif in DeMille's films . . . as in ' Four Frightened People ' , in which Claudette Colbert and Herbert Marshall portray two repressed people who lose their inhibitions ( and their clothing ) in a tropical paradise . Basquette's eyeliner remains intact throughout her adventures . " The Godless Girl " was the peak of Basquette's career . Allegedly , her performance in this film was so convincing that movie audiences supposedly assumed that Basquette herself must be as immoral as the atheist she portrays here . . . and so she was never again cast in a starring role . I suspect that Basquette was actually a casualty of talking pictures . " The Godless Girl " was filmed as a silent movie with brief sound-film sequences in the final reel . The audible sequences reveal that Basquette was unsuited for a career in talking pictures . Her voice isn't as bad as Marceline Day's ( another leading lady of the late silent era whose peculiar diction scuttled her talking-picture career ) , but Basquette's voice isn't very good and it records badly . Ironically , one of Basquette's husbands was Sam Warner of Warner Brothers : the one man in Hollywood who , more than anyone else , pushed for the talking-film revolution . ( Sam's brother Jack L Warner opposed the idea , but was quick to take credit after Sam's death . ) After Basquette's last divorce , she retired to a remote farm in Pennsylvania where she bred Great Danes , also working as an unpaid judge at dog shows . In 1943 , an AWOL serviceman trespassed on Basquette's farm and raped her . The assault made national headlines ; prior to Connie Francis , Lina Basquette was probably the most famous show-biz personality to be publicly identified as a rape victim . Her assailant was convicted , and he did heavy prison time . Sadly , in the 1940s and ' 50s , Basquette was better known for being raped than for her careers as an actress and dog breeder . " The Godless Girl " is heavy-handed , but still a very powerful film which I strongly recommend . It's an excellent example of the awkward period of Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies . I'll rate this movie .
419448	1609079	2646	7.0	Not exactly a sinking ship , but . . .	I saw ' Atlantis ' at the opening weekend of the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy , in October 2006 . Several other IMDb reviewers have commented ( incorrectly ) that this 1913 film was inspired by the Titanic disaster of the previous year , and have also commented ( correctly ) about the physical ampleness and ineptitude of the exotic dancer portrayed by Ida Orlov . I shall address both of those points . ' Atlantis ' was originally a novel by German author Gerhart Hauptmann ( 1862-1946 ) , who received the 1912 Nobel Prize for Literature . One section of this novel describes the sinking of a huge ocean liner in the middle of the Atlantic , with great loss of lives . Hauptmann's novel was published ( in serial form ) a few weeks BEFORE the real-life Titanic disaster , which isn't such an amazing coincidence : steamships were still the primary form of transoceanic travel ; compromises on safety - - such as an insufficiency of lifeboats , and a lack of lifeboat drills - - were commonplace , and many people felt that an eventual disaster was inevitable . When the film version of ' Atlantis ' went into production , shortly AFTER the Titanic's sinking , this film's producers were aware of the similarity between fiction and fact . . . but they were also aware ( unlike modern viewers ) that Hauptmann's novel was still in the bookstalls at the time , still being read ( in 1913 , Hauptmann was considered Germany's greatest living novelist ) and they were confident that most film-goers in 1913 would know that this movie was based on material written BEFORE the Titanic's fatal voyage . ' Atlantis ' was the Nordisk film studio's most expensive and ambitious production , billed as an ' Autorenfilm ' : an ' author-film ' adapted from a recognised work of literature . Hauptmann's novel was partly autobiographical , and his contract with Nordisk stipulated that two roles in the film must be cast with the actual people who had inspired those characters in his novel . Hauptmann had enjoyed an erotic relationship with Ida Orlov in , when she had been a teenage cabaret dancer . ( Hauptmann was 28 years her senior . ) In ' Atlantis ' , Orlov plays an erotic dancer but fails to convey whatever bewitched Hauptmann seven years earlier on ; still , Nordisk were forced to cast her in order for this movie to be made . The other inspirational figure here is more interesting . Carl ( Charles ) Unthan ( 1848-1929 ) was born without arms , and from early childhood he used his bare feet as hands . From the 1870s onward he toured Europe as a concert artiste , not only playing a violin with his unshod feet ( wearing open-toed socks ) but reportedly even replacing and tuning the violin's strings onstage . After the Great War , this armless man visited Germany's military hospitals to assure the soldiers that loss of a limb need not be insurmountable . ( In Chaplin's film ' Limelight ' , set in roughly this same period , Chaplin's character Calvero makes an oblique reference to Unthan . ) In ' Atlantis ' , Unthan demonstrates his armless dexterity but is assisted by a younger attendant ( Frantz Skondrup ) . According to Unthan's memoir - - wittily titled ' Das Pediskript ' - - when he was younger and more supple , he refused to let anyone be his ' hands ' . Unthan was in his sixties when he filmed ' Atlantis ' : he's still handsome and poised here , and his performance is fascinating . It's a shame that Unthan - - sort of a reverse Johnny Eck - - was well past middle age when movies arrived ; he could have had a career as a film actor ! It would be fascinating to see Unthan perform in a film similar to Tod Browning's ' The Unknown ' . SYNOPSIS AND SPOILERS : The protagonist of ' Atlantis ' is Friedrich von Kammacher , a surgeon . His wife ( Lily Frederiksen ) becomes insane and bed-ridden when his life's work ( a dissertation ) is rejected . He flees to Berlin , where he is seduced by Ingigerd , an erotic dancer . Strangely compelled by her , von Kammacher abandons his past life and he accompanies Ingigerd to America aboard the ocean liner ' Atlantis ' . ( Why would anyone name a ship for a land mass that SANK ? ) When the ship is wrecked in mid-Atlantic , von Kammacher and Ingigerd are among the few survivors brought to New York . An armless man ( guess who ) assists Ingigerd in her showbiz career , but von Kammacher is now estranged from her . Depressed by all that's happened ( and I don't much blame him ) , von Kammacher flees to a remote mountain cabin . But the beautiful sculptress Eva Burns admires him ( though I can't imagine why ) . She follows von Kammacher into the hinterlands ; they fall in love . . . but von Kammacher has conveniently discovered a medicine which will cure his wife . He rushes back to Denmark . The end . An alternate ending was shown in Russian cinemas , with von Kammacher dying . For once , I agree with the Russians . ' Atlantis ' is an ambitious film , fatally compromised by the casting of Ida Orlov . Although she is playing a character allegedly inspired by her own younger self , she quite fails here to demonstrate the erotic qualities which had originally intoxicated the author of this tosh . A further flaw is the casting of Olaf Fønss as von Kammacher : Fønss is handsome and brooding , but he fails to convey the range of emotions which von Kammacher experiences . Worse , von Kammacher is simply not a very sympathetic protagonist : he shows no qualms about abandoning any woman who is no longer useful to him , yet he seems to feel that women should accept him ( and love him ) as he is . I was intrigued to see future film director Michael Curtiz in this film's supporting cast . I'll rate ' Atlantis ' .
418232	1609079	39896	7.0	. . . and they won't bereave you , either .	' They Won't Believe Me ' is an excellent second-rank ' noir ' drama . I usually dislike movies told in flashback , but here the gimmick works . Larry Ballantyne ( Robert Young ) is on trial for murdering Verna Carlson ( Susan Hayward ) . His testimony constitutes the bulk of the film's action , in flashback . In the courtroom , we see witnesses who have testified against Ballantyne ; when he meets these undistinguished people during the flashback , we know they'll be major figures in his downfall . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . There is one annoying and unnecessary gimmick : a homicide lieutenant improbably sits in the courtroom with his face turned away from the bench ( and the camera ) , so that when we meet him during the flashback we don't recognise him . Obscure actor George Tyne gives a stand-out performance in this role . Tom Powers is also excellent as the head of the brokerage firm in which Larry's wife bought him a partnership . Robert Young skilfully plays against his nice-guy image as Ballantyne , who is married to a wealthy beautiful woman but can't help starting relationships with other women : first Janice ( played by the dull Jane Greer ) , then Verna . As portrayed by Rita Johnson , Ballantyne's wife Greta is sexier and classier ( and richer ) than these other women , so I couldn't sympathise with his flirtations . Even Greta's aunt Martha ( Lillian Bronson ) is sexier and classier than Larry's bits on the side . After planning various crimes , including embezzlement , Larry makes a getaway with Verna that culminates in a road accident : Larry escapes , but Verna is burnt beyond recognition . When Larry wakes up in hospital , we get the visual cliche of the hospital patient with head bandages but no head injuries . Because Verna was wearing a wedding ring - an incredibly cheap one that Greta never would have worn - the authorities assume that the dead woman is Greta . When Larry returns to his wife's secluded ranch , he finds Greta conveniently dead in a riding accident . There's some clever imagery with a palomino horse symbolising Fate . ( I hadn't realised that Fate is a gelding . ) Larry hides Greta's corpse on her ranch , knowing that Verna was issued a death certificate as Greta . But then the authorities come looking for Verna , and they think Larry stashed her corpse on Greta's ranch . . . There's plenty of irony here , and some typical noir narration about Fate dealing a hand from a new deck of cards , and so forth . The flashback device raises no end of questions . Traditionally , audiences don't like dishonest flashbacks ( the single biggest reason for the failure of Hitchcock's ' Stage Fright ' ) : we want to believe that what we see depicted onscreen is what actually happened . Rather implausibly , we see here that Larry's trysts with other women are quite innocent and non-sexual : his friendship with Janice centres on their mutual love of deep-sea fishing ! Also , although Larry benefits from the deaths of Verna and Greta , we clearly see that their deaths ( and the misidentification of Verna's corpse as Greta ) are down to circumstances outside Larry's control . Are we witnessing the truth , or are Larry's flashbacks skewed to benefit himself ? In flashback , we see Larry finding Greta's corpse after a riding accident , but for all we know he murdered her and then lied about it . Just before the jury's verdict is read , something utterly unexpected happens . I didn't see it coming , but as soon as it happened I knew what the jury's verdict would be . A small but key role ( as the court clerk ) is played by Milton Parsons , who ranks high on my list of favourite character actors . Unfortunately , Parsons speaks his ( few ) lines in this film with the affected accent that he sometimes used . This accent worked well for Parsons when he played mad scientists or perverts , but here it brings more attention to Parsons than his role merits . Still , the last shot in this film is a tight close-up of Parsons's skull-like face as he reads the jury's verdict . ' They Won't Believe Me ' is an excellent film , and I'll rate it .
419661	1609079	31844	7.0	Not as good as ' Sunrise ' , but . . .	By general consensus , the greatest film of the silent-movie era is ' Sunrise : A Song of Two Humans ' ( 1927 ) , made in Hollywood by German director F . W . Murnau . I personally prefer ' Metropolis ' , but there's no doubt that ' Sunrise ' is one of the most lyrical and visually beautiful films ever made . So I was astonished to learn that another German director , Veit Harlan , remade the same story only 12 years later under its original title , as ' The Excursion to Tilsit ' . One would assume that ' Sunrise ' , being a silent film and therefore universal to all languages , didn't need to be remade so soon . However , there's a basic air of unreality to silent films , and Murnau's drama emphasises that aspect : Harlan's remake is far more earthy , darker and more realistic . Also , it's notable that this remake was produced during the Third Reich , and that Veit Harlan was fanatically loyal to Nazism . He may have felt that Murnau's version of this story was ' tainted ' by having been made in Hollywood with American actors . The story here is almost identical to ' Sunrise ' . Endrik Settegast ( Fritz van Dongen ) is a poor fisherman in a village across the bay from the city of Tilsit . Elske ( Kristina Söderbaum ) is his simple wife , plain-looking but not unattractive . Endrik runs afoul of Madlyn , a rather obviously ' bad ' woman who sets out to seduce him . It's never clear , in either film version of this story , why the temptress puts so much effort into seducing the pauper husband , as he has nothing to offer her apart from his good looks and brawny physique . Madlyn persuades Endrik that the two of them should run away to the big city together . . . but first Endrik must kill his wife . Endrik lures the unsuspecting Elske into his tiny sailboat , on the pretext of taking her to Tilsit . Halfway across the bay , he makes known his intentions to kill her . And then . . . if you've seen ' Sunrise ' , you already know the rest . If not , I don't want to spoil that pleasure for you by revealing it here . I mentioned an air of unreality in ' Sunrise ' . Murnau's film features a bizarre scene in which the husband and wife board a tram that stops in the middle of the woods . After a brief ride , they arrive in a city of hugely exaggerated skyscrapers , resembling ' Metropolis ' or ' Just Imagine ' more than any realistic place . On some level , this exaggeration makes sense : we're seeing this city through the wondering eyes of a couple of hicks . In Veit Harlan's remake , everything is more realistic . Elske and her husband board a Strassenbahn ( streetcar ) that looks very prosaic and plausible , and it conveys them to a realistic city . ( The exterior sequences in this film have a documentary feel . ) Harlan's version of this story is in every way more realistic than Murnau's silent masterpiece . . . but for precisely that reason , this remake lacks most of the lyrical beauty of that splendid film . In ' Sunrise ' , the main characters are identified as ' the Man ' and ' the Woman ' , and they visit a generic Big City . This heightens the universality of the story , and also its unreality . In Harlan's remake , a realistic peasant couple visit a clearly identified real place . It's possible that German audiences in 1939 preferred a story that was explicitly about Germans in a German setting . ( We see no Jews or other ' foreign ' characters in this movie . ) The photography in ' The Excursion to Tilsit ' is beautiful throughout . The scene in the Tilsit cafe , when Endrik desperately pleads with Elske to forgive him ( after he's just attempted to murder her ) is compelling and deeply believable : this was for me the least plausible scene in ' Sunrise ' , and it's the one scene in which Harlan's film surpasses the original . Kristina Söderbaum gives a fine performance as the peasant wife : we completely understand that she lives in a world in which women with no money have few options , and that she's arguably better off with a husband who might just possibly kill her than with no husband at all . Fritz van Dongen is believable as her husband . The child actor who plays their small son Jons actually gives a good performance that avoids becoming maudlin . The scenes in the fishing village are fascinating , and utterly realistic . I'm aware that this movie was made by a bunch of Nazis , but it's a good movie anyway . . . very nearly a great film .

I saw this short drama at the 1998 Cinema Muto festival in Pordenone ; they screened a print from the Library of Congress with the original intertitles missing . The title " Those Boys ! " and the short running time ( 133 feet ) led me to expect that this would be a comedy . When the mother of the large family puts her husband's pistol into a desk drawer , I still thought this would be a comedy - - an edgy one - - involving firearms . The family's two boys , who have been out playing at archery , find the pistol and load it ( ! ) . Meanwhile , their three sisters are playing in the attic . Believing themselves alone , the boys hang their archery target on the attic door for some pistol practice , unaware that their sisters are directly behind the thin door . SPOILERS COMING . Fortunately the resourceful family maid discovers that the pistol is missing , and . . . I take gun safety very seriously . The media occasionally report real cases of disaster after a child finds the family firearm ; invariably , this turns out to be in households where nobody has bothered to learn the NRA safety procedures . I was intrigued to see that this topic was a concern back in 1909 . This movie also reminded me of the real-life case of James Thurber ; as a boy , he lost an eye when his older brother got stupid with an archery set . Concerning the fictional parents in this film , I'm tempted to say that anyone who's stupid enough to leave handguns and ammunition where children can get at them deserves whatever happens . . . but it's usually the children who get hurt , not the idiots who failed to learn gun safety . I was also intrigued to see Florence Lawrence - - the first movie star - - in this film , cast as the maid rather than the wife . Lawrence is technically the heroine here , yet her role is subordinate to Anita Hendrie's as the wife . Was Hendrie considered a more popular actress than Lawrence in 1909 ? I think not , but I might be mistaken . My rating for this one is . Lock and load !
419168	1609079	62323	7.0	Can't a Menshevik be a mensch ?	I'm not as fluent in Russian as I'd like to be , so a Russian friend suggested that I hone my limited skills by watching this movie : the characters ' actions are simple and clear ( and the plot is quite funny ) even though I had difficulty following the Russian dialogue . I wasn't surprised to learn that ' Wedding in Malinovka ' is based on an operetta : the behaviour of the characters in this comedy is certainly operatic . I viewed a print with German subtitles ( ' Hochzeit In Malinowka ' ) , but I avoided reading them in order to see if I could decipher the Russian dialogue . The film takes place during Russia's civil war between the Reds ( Bolsheviks ) and the Whites ( Mensheviks ) . Andrejka and Yarinka are a young betrothed couple in the village of Malinovka , caught between the battle lines . Gritsian is the leader of a Menshevik band who are planning to attack the village . Yarinka ( played by Valentina Lysenko , quite pretty ) appeals to the local Bolshevik commander for his faction's help . The Bolsheviks quickly come up with a plan to save the village . . . but the plan requires Yarinka to enter into a pretend marriage with Gritsian . The action climaxes in a drunken wedding feast . There's a lot of singing and dancing here , most of it extraneous to the plot . I was quite surprised that this low-budget musical comedy reminded me of the very high-budget musical drama ' West Side Story ' . In the latter film , the rival gangs clash more or less as equals but the audience are encouraged to identify with the Jets as the ' good ' gang whilst perceiving the Sharks as foreign interlopers : the ' evil ' gang . ' Wedding in Malinovka ' was made by the Soviets , so naturally it depicts the Red army as courageous freedom fighters whilst showing the White army as drunken bandits and hooligans who use revolution as a mere pretence for looting and mayhem . From an objective viewpoint , the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were pretty much moral equivalents . . . but the Bolsheviks just happened to win the struggle between factions . I was offended by this film's politics . . . but not surprised by them , under the circumstances . The film is well-made on its low budget ( though somewhat high by Soviet standards ) , and I laughed out loud several times . My rating for this one : .
419105	1609079	1097268	7.0	Depressing , shocking , yet uplifting and empowering .	I attended the press screening for ' Very Young Girls ' in New York City . . . where this documentary was filmed , although it addresses a problem hardly unique to that city : child prostitution . According to a statement at the start of this film , the AVERAGE age when children enter prostitution is 13 . . . which means that half of them are younger ! Two punks named Anthony and Chris Griffith ( bruthahs from " the hood " ) decided to get rich by forcing very young girls to streetwalk for them , and also shooting home-movie footage of the girls plying this trade . The Griffiths planned to increase their wealth and fame by creating a cable-TV programme based on this footage . While holding my nose , I must endorse one aspect of this scheme : I have no doubt that the cable-TV companies would eagerly beat a path to the Griffiths ' address . Fortunately , their current address is a prison . ( More about this later . ) Some of their video footage shows up in this documentary : grinning smugly , the Griffiths cheerfully admit that they consider the girls to be mere merchandise , the property of the Griffiths as pimps . The girls seen here are all New York City teens , some of them VERY young teens , and most of them African-American . Although they all fell into the Griffiths ' clutches , they also had the good luck to cross paths with Rachel Lloyd , founder of Girls ' Educational and Mentoring Services ( and also co-exec producer of this documentary ) . GEMS are an outreach group dedicated to rescuing young women from the sex industry , and stabilising their lives . We meet individual girls , telling their stories before , during and after prostitution . It's no surprise that some of them had absent or abusive fathers : often , the leering attention they received from the Griffiths was the nearest they'd ever experienced to male affection . The Griffiths bait their trap with sweet talk and presents , getting the girls hooked on drugs ( and therefore dependent ) , then terrorising them to make sure they obey . We see a brief clip of a ' john class ' . Men arrested for patronising prostitutes in New York City , if they have no previous record , have the opportunity to clean their records if they attend a lecture on the dangers of prostitution . The johns we see here are clearly merely going through the motions : one man arrogantly asks when they can take a break . Two of the men seen here wear Jewish regalia ( one Hasidic ) , and I'm sure there are a few church-going Christians in the pew , too . Pyew ! As these former prostitutes regain their humanity , they also discover their individuality . One GEMS alumna gets an office job , another becomes a GEMS counsellor . Another one gets married in a Pentecostal wedding . Sadly , at least one goes back to her old tricks . Another vanishes without a trace . I found most of this movie chillingly realistic . Only one sequence seemed staged : a mother has spent months trying to locate her teen daughter , without a single clue ; the documentary camera is conveniently present when she finally gets the crucial phone call . The image and sound editing are inconsistent : some curse words are bleeped , others left audible . Some people's faces are digitally blurred in odd ways ( noses and mouths obscured but eyes intact ) , and the people so favoured aren't always the ones you'd expect : why is a bailiff in a court case blurred out , since he's doing his honest job efficiently , and he has no reason to conceal his identity ? Due to poor audio recording ( especially in the Griffiths ' footage ) and the terrible diction of many participants , several sequences are given much-needed subtitles . . . but other sequences need this device yet don't receive it . Speaking of diction : Rachel Lloyd ( a British-born survivor of sexual abuse in her teen years ) is a charismatic advocate for her cause , but she has one of the most bizarre speech patterns I've ever encountered . . . a prole Noo Yawk accent interlaced with London working-class inflexions . Here , we see her graciously accepting an award on behalf of GEMS while denouncing the industry that gave an Academy Award to the song " It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp " . Elsewhere , Ms Young points out a cruel irony : these girls are legally below the age of consent and therefore cannot legally agree to have sexual intercourse , yet they are arrested for prostitution . The Griffiths were ultimately convicted , and their own amateur footage was used as evidence against them . Yet , oddly , they were only nicked on a variant of the Mann Act , transporting a prostitute across state lines . This is something I've never understood about U . S . law : why is a felony across state lines considered so much worse than a felony that stays put ? With this movie's title and subject matter , some people will want to see ' Very Young Girls ' for prurient reasons . As far as that goes , there are only a few brief shots on offer here of streetwalkers , faces obscured , in the early stages of negotiation with customers . I would describe ' Very Young Girls ' as honest , except for one strange omission : nowhere in this documentary is there any mention of Aids or other sexually-transmitted diseases . As a crudely-made but sincere documentary that addresses a real problem , I'll rate ' Very Young Girls ' .
418241	1609079	8134	7.0	Very much of its time	' In Again , Out Again ' was Douglas Fairbanks's first film for his own production company ( Artcraft ) but it finds him doing pretty much the same comedy he was doing for other producers : contrived slapstick , with set-piece occasions to show off his athletic prowess . Front-rank stardom would not come for Fairbanks until he learnt to soft-pedal the comedy in favour of swashbuckling . Here we have a 1917 comedy that's very much in tune with the politics of its time . Fairbanks's character is named Teddy Rutherford , and he shares the jingo expansionist politics of Teddy Roosevelt , with a dash of Rutherford Hayes . Unfortunately , he comes up against a family of pacifists cried Jennings . An insert shot of the centrepiece in their home - - a very large photo of William Jennings Bryan , with much smaller portraits of Lincoln and Washington - - told audiences in 1917 all they needed to know about this clan's sympathies . The cleverest character name in the film is that worn by the burglar played by Bull Montana . His calling card ( burglars have calling cards ? ) identifies him as Quentin Auburn , a clever play on the names of two Stateside prisons . There's also a good joke about Sing Sing . Sadly , the leading lady in this comedy is Arline Pretty , whom I've never found particularly pretty nor appealing in any other way . I was astonished by one sequence in which Fairbanks goes to his local dispensary ( drugstore ) and asks the chemist for a shot of rye whisky . This lurk was common in the USA during Prohibition , when druggists were the only people legally allowed to dispense alcoholic drinks ( for prescription only ) . But this film was released in 1917 , a couple of years BEFORE the Volstead Act . When did American druggists start selling ' snake-bite ' medication ? I'll rate ' In Again , Out Again ' : its biggest appeal will be for Fairbanks fans .
418469	1609079	379224	7.0	Elaborate fakery with authentic " book-end " footage	The earliest ' newsreel ' films were in fact fakes : re-enactments produced in a studio , with ( usually amateur ) actors impersonating the public figures , and often ludicrously bad stage effects to simulate fire , flood and other forces of nature . ' The Coronation of Edward VII ' is one more such fake , but is notable for being a much more elaborate production than others of its kind . . . and is also notable because it's a ' pre-enactment ' of a real event , having been filmed BEFORE ( rather than after ) the actual event it purports to depict . The synopsis of this movie ( elsewhere on this IMDb site ) is both an accurate rundown of the film and also an accurate recounting of the coronation ceremony itself , being so heavily ritualised as to be more or less scripted . However , the fakery is obvious to modern viewers and was probably obvious even to unsophisticated film audiences of the time . ' Westminster Abbey ' , as seen here under the harsh and flat studio lighting , is clearly a painted set . The actors cast as H . M . Edward VII and his consort Queen Alexandra - - amateurs supposedly chosen for their physical resemblance to the real figures - - are obvious fakes . The actor playing the king is too thin , and his beard is too small ( the real Edward VII , after decades of soft living , was quite heavy-set indeed when he finally succeeded to the throne ) . The actress playing Queen Alexandra looks nothing like her , and is too heavy . Worse luck , the ( fake ) Archbishop of Canterbury and the other priests are garbed in robes which look more appropriate for a French Catholic mass than for an Anglican service . Filmmaker Georges Melies and his ( American-born ) British producer Charles Urban made considerable effort to have this film shot , edited , printed and shipped to exhibitors in time for Coronation Day , so that audiences who couldn't watch the actual event would be able to witness this enactment simultaneous to the actual coronation ! On Coronation Day , Urban set up a Bell & Howell camera outside Westminster Abbey and shot authentic footage of the royal carriage arriving for the coronation and departing afterward . This footage - - genuine newsreel - - became book-ends , spliced before and after Melies's faked footage of the coronation . So , audiences who saw this film after Coronation Day were at least able to witness some authentic footage at the beginning and the end . More for the effort and ingenuity put into it than any historic value , I'll rate this movie .
418764	1609079	21296	7.0	The song of Roland has no Love for Montagu	Pearl White is the best-known silent-serial star , but Ruth Roland deserves to be remembered too . I find the dark-haired Ruth sexier than the fair-haired Pearl , and Ruth Roland's serials tended to be slightly more plausible than Pearl's . Some of Ruth Roland's silent serials even featured the intriguing device of captions and dialogue superimposed ( in white letters ) upon black objects on-screen in the frame compositions during the movie's action , so that there was no need to interrupt the action with inter-titles . Whereas Pearl White's screen career ended in 1924 , Ruth Roland continued to make films into the talkie era , revealing a pleasant voice for speaking and - - here in ' Reno ' - - for singing . Sadly , her screen career had lost momentum even before the cancer that prematurely killed her . SYNOPSIS : Society matron Felicia Brett ( Roland ) is unhappily married ; she and her husband Alexander have a young son , whom Felicia dearly loves . When it becomes clear that her marriage cannot be saved , Felicia heads for the divorce mecca in Nevada . . . but she's determined to retain custody of her son . One of the deepest flaws in this film is the performance of Montagu Love as Felicia's husband . On an earlier occasion , drama critic Heywood Broun described Love's acting technique as follows : ' He thrusts out his chest and then follows it across the stage . ' In ' Reno ' , Montagu Love plays all his scenes in Snidely Whiplash mode . When Alexander Brett contests his wife's attempts to gain custody of their son , Montagu Love's scenery-chewing makes it clear that Brett is motivated by sheer spite rather than love for the child . It helps a bit that young Bobby Brett is played by a child actor who's actually less twee and more talented than usual . SPOILERS COMING . Before Felicia has lived in Reno long enough to qualify for the residency status that will enable her to divorce Alexander , he contrives a situation in which she appears to be committing adultery with Dick Belden , her friend from childhood . Using this falsified evidence , Alexander Brett proceeds to take sole custody of Bobby . But then a convenient avalanche kills Brett . As the divorce was not yet final , Felicia is now Brett's widow - - not his ex-wife - - and she's free to marry Belden . Ruth Roland acquits herself well here , projecting grace and dignity and some sex appeal . Her speaking voice records well , and she has a musical number - - ' As Long As We're Together ' - - which she sings splendidly , although the song itself is insipid . Despite her premature death , I'm surprised that she didn't have a better career in early talkies . On the strength of Ruth Roland's performance ( and a few supporting performances ) rather than any merits in the turgid script , I'll rate ' Reno ' .
419299	1609079	24679	7.0	Did the Joker follow the Ace of Spades ?	SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' is one of those wildly implausible movies from Hollywood's studio era which still manage to be hugely enjoyable on the strength of sheer audacity and some colourful performances . Here we have that old chestnut : the serial murderer who announces his crimes in advance , in a highly theatrical manner , yet repeatedly kills his victims without getting caught . We also have that even mouldier chestnut : the amateur sleuth who is able to outwit the cops and nab the baddie . In this case , the murderer proclaims his intentions in advance by delivering to each victim an ace of spades ( the death card ) , with a neatly-written message announcing the hour at which he intends to do the deed . Naturally , he consistently manages to kill his victims ( and get away clean , his identity a secret ) even though they've been well and fairly warned . As the killer neglects to leave his name in the guest-book , he is cried the Ace of Spades . He murders wealthy art dealer Asa Marsden , and here we get another old-movie cliché : the murder shown from the killer's viewpoint . We see the victim goggling into the camera as the killer carks him , but the murderer is unseen . Next , the Ace of Spades announces his intention to murder wealthy Thornton Drake ' tomorrow at seven ' . ( Presumably this is P . M . , not A . M . . . . surely even serial murderers shouldn't have to get up early . ) At the fatal hour , the deed is done aboard an aeroplane in flight . At the stroke of seven , the lights go out in the passenger cabin . . . then they switch on again , and there's a corpse on the deckplates , stabbed through the heart . But the dead man isn't Drake : it's his secretary Austin Winters . Afterwards , the pilot claims to know nothing . The official detectives in this movie are played by two of my favourite character actors : Frank McHugh and the superb Allen Jenkins . Here they play characters named Clancy and Dugan , which gives you some idea of what to expect . Unfortunately , both actors perform their sleuth roles as comedy relief , which I found regrettable : the murders in this movie are played straight , so the seriousness of the homicides is undercut by the intentional comedy of the detectives trying to catch the killer . Screenwriter Ralph Spence often combined straightforward chills and broad comedy in his scripts - - notably in his play ' The Gorilla ' - - but here the mixture isn't as smooth as usual . The hero of this film is played by Chester Morris , so it's obvious who will solve the crime . For some reason , a lot of Hollywood whodunnits of the 1930s and ' 40s featured amateur detectives . Here , Morris plays a mystery novelist ( oh , boy ) who is researching the criminal career of the Ace of Spades as material for his next book . Morris decides that it might make a nice finish for his book if he actually catches the murderer . Along with this film's other merits , there's the Batman factor . It's well known that Batman's greatest villain the Joker ( created in 1939 ) was inspired by the character played by Conrad Veidt in ' The Man Who Laughs ' . But the premise of ' Tomorrow at Seven ' strongly resembles the premise of the Joker's debut story , and this 1933 movie may have supplied some inspiration to Batman's scriptwriter Bill Finger . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' has a lot of the little touches that make 1930s B-movies so enjoyable . Unfortunately , this movie also has a couple of the little touches so typical of that time which are very much less enjoyable . Here , we get a mercifully brief turn by African-American actor Gus Robinson in a ' yassuh ! ' role . I don't blame Robinson , whose options as a black actor in 1930s Hollywood must have been limited . I'll rate this otherwise enjoyable movie .
418885	1609079	44388	7.0	Eric Blore as a jolly genie	The funniest Bowery Boys movies are the ones with the most wildly implausible plots . Anybody who watches a Bowery Boys movie in expectation of deep thoughts on the human condition is looking in the wrong place . ' Bowery to Bagdad ' has one of the looniest plots in the entire Bowery Boys series . . . and it's possibly the funniest of them all . Much of the credit goes to a splendid performance by the veteran character actor Eric Blore , making his only appearance in a Bowery Boys movie . This movie should actually be titled ' Baghdad to Bowery ' because that's the way the action moves . The story starts with a newspaper headline announcing the disappearance of a valuable Oriental lamp . Then we see a montage shot of a couple of bit players pretending to be Arabs ( with beards and headcloths ) who are searching the entire world for the missing lamp . Of course , it turns up in Louie Dumbrowski's candy shop . ( Stranger things have happened in real life : the necklace worn by Mary Queen of Scots when she got her head chopped off later turned up in an obscure antiques shop . ) Needless to say , this is a magic lamp with a genie . The genie is played by Eric Blore with his usual droll humour , wearing a pantomime-genie outfit that includes a turban and a pair of those curly-toed shoes . When Sach ( Huntz Hall ) frees the genie from the lamp , Blore offers to use his magical powers to give Sach anything he desires . Proving just how big a moron he is , Sach wishes for a long row of chocolate sodas . He also wishes that the genie would enlarge one particular part of his body . Guess which part . Yes , you're right : his biceps . The sight of Huntz Hall swaggering about with Schwarzenegger muscles is truly bizarre . This film has a larger budget than usual for the Bowery Boys . The genie's magical effects are amusingly depicted with some well-edited jump cuts , of the sort later used on ' Bewitched ' . Even the plot is more engaging than usual : the Bowery Boys go up against a gang of deeze-dem-doze crooks who want the lamp ( and the genie ) for themselves ; when the lamp falls temporarily into the gangsters ' clutches , I actually felt some concern . The ending is quite funny , with Sach innocently making a wish that lands him and Slip ( Leo Gorcey ) in big trouble . Speaking of Leo Gorcey , did you know he shared a wife with Groucho Marx ? Kay Marvis divorced Gorcey , then later married Groucho . I'll bet she had some interesting stories . I'll rate ' Bowery to Bagdad ' . It's a toss-up between this film and ' Master Minds ' for the funniest Bowery Boys movie .
418191	1609079	32796	8.0	Excellent second feature	' Millionaires in Prison ' is an excellent example of something that doesn't exist anymore , but which was commonplace in the days of the big Hollywood studios : the second feature . In the 1930s and ' 40s , Americans went to the movies expecting to receive a full evening's worth of entertainment : a double feature plus short subjects and a newsreel . The second feature ( which was actually first , as it was screened before the main feature ) typically had a shorter running time , lower budget and more obscure actors and director than the more prestigious main feature . . . but , at their best , the second features were always well-made and solidly entertaining in their own right . ' Millionaires in Prison ' is one of the very best examples of that tradition . The movie opens with a brisk but heavy-handed expository scene , featuring a newspaper editor named R . J . Reynolds . ( Could this be a plug for the tobacco company ? ) Reynolds is giving his reporters an assignment to do a story on four millionaire financiers who have recently been sent to prison for financial shenanigans . Interestingly , the editor tells his reporters in advance precisely how they're supposed to slant their reportage . ( This sort of thing happens all the time in the real world , but I've never seen it depicted in any other movie : in Movieland , reporters are always objective truth-seekers . ) Two of the millionaires , well-played by veteran actors Raymond Walburn and Thurston Hall , are befuddled fall guys who somehow took the rap for someone else's embezzlement . Reynolds tells his reporters ( and us ) that these lads are innocent , and he adds : ' Go easy on them , boys . ' On the other hand , the other two millionaires are outright crooks who are guilty as hell , and Reynolds gleefully tells his newshounds to pull all the stops out on them . Walburn and Hall give enjoyable performances , but the characters they're playing aren't very credible . It's difficult to believe that these two dimwits could ever have been successful financiers . They're in a fairly conventional prison ( not a Club Fed ) , doing hard time , yet they seem to think they're in some sort of country club . There's a nice complement of veteran film faces here , with Lee Tracy and Morgan Conway at their cynical best , and a welcome turn by Shemp Howard . Even the annoying Chester Clute , one of my most un-favourite actors , manages to be less annoying than usual here . I kept hoping there'd be a cellblock riot and Clute would get taken hostage . ( Or maybe a scene in the prison showers where Clute drops the soap . . . ) ' Millionaires in Prison ' is very ably directed by Ray McCarey , who was much less talented than his brother Leo McCarey but who was nonetheless a reliable director in his own right . Ray McCarey's work is long overdue for reappraisal , and ' Millionaires in Prison ' is a good place to start . I'll rate this film .
418719	1609079	270652	8.0	World's first S & M movie ?	I saw this early Italian silent film in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto festival . . . in Italy , appropriately enough . What a movie ! Why isn't ' Sole ! ' better known ? Apart from its other merits , this may well be the first S & M movie ! It's certainly the earliest movie I've seen which expressly depicts a character as sadistic in the Krafft-Ebing sense , rather than merely cruel . Leda Gys gives an astonishing performance as Sole , a demi-mondaine who lives on the outskirts of Naples . When a young man with amorous intentions ( Piero Concialdi ) follows her to her door , she ties him to the door and torments him erotically all night , leaving him a gibbering simpleton in the morning . ( Actually , I thought he was a gibbering simpleton before he got there . ) Next , she meets the wealthy and cultured Baron Silvestro ( Ignazio Lupi ) , who attempts to give Sole the male chauvinist Pygmalion treatment by giving her an education and introducing her to society . . . including the Marquis de Vamberry ( Goffredo D'Andrea ) . But it's clear that Sole is a woman of the streets and she chooses to stay that way , so she's soon back in her old Neapolitan haunts . . . where she meets another amorous young buck named Totò ( Giovanni Grasso ) . He too follows Sole to her door - - the same door - - but this time Sole's sadistic propensities know no bounds . We're not in Kansas any more , Totò . As I said : What a movie ! Leda Gys's acting and Pasquale Parisi's screenplay make it clear that Sole despises all men , and that she's erotically stimulated by arousing them and then hurting them . . . not merely tormenting them psychologically , but literally torturing them . At the same go , Parisi's screenplay takes a negative attitude towards Sole : she's a woman of the streets , so she's incapable of rising above her nature and appreciating the finer things in life . I'm astounded that this movie was made in 1919 , though I can readily understand why it seems never to have been exhibited in the much more staid climes of the United States and Britain . I'll rate ' Sole ! ' . Why don't I ever meet women like her ?
418979	1609079	128972	8.0	No budget , no banjo , but Formby's just fine	By almost any criterion , ' Boots ! Boots ! ' is an incredibly crude and primitive film . It was made in two weeks , on a shoestring budget , in a room above a garage off Regent Street . Although the action takes place in several different rooms of an hotel , the entire film was shot in one room , with the furniture and set dressing changed very slightly for the different settings . However , ' Boots ! Boots ! ' is a vitally important film for two reasons . It's the first starring vehicle for George Formby , and it's also the only film appearance of his wife Beryl . Although Beryl Formby began as a tap-dancer in the variety halls , she wasn't cut out for stardom . She found greater success managing her husband's career , and controlling every single aspect of his life , including his pocket money . Beryl Formby controlled her husband so utterly that he was forbidden to kiss any of his leading ladies in any of his films , and Beryl the Peril was always present on the movie set to make sure this rule was followed . ( On one occasion , when Beryl Formby was too ill to be present on the set , the entire cast and crew applauded . ) The title of ' Boots ! Boots ! ' refers not to the Kipling poem , but to Formby's character . He plays the gormless ' boots ' ( bootblack ) in what's meant to be a posh hotel , although you wouldn't know it from the production values seen here . Much as in Jerry Lewis's very similar film ' The Bellboy ' , there isn't really any plot here : the film is just an excuse to show George getting into various muddles with the hotel's manager , the chef , some guests and the scullery maid . The latter is played by Beryl Formby , who looks fairly attractive in a maid's uniform ( long skirt , long sleeves ; not much kink quotient ) but who proves she's no actress . Eventually , George gets to skin out of his servant rig and get into white tie and tails , performing in the hotel's nightclub . As usual for a George Formby film , the whole affair is an excuse for his cheeky songs , which here have titles such as ' Sitting on the Ice in the Ice Rink ' and ' I Could Make a Good Living at That ' . In the dialogue of his later films , George referred to his musical instrument as his ' uke ' or his ' ukulele ' , but in fact his usual instrument was a ' banjolele ' - - a short-necked banjo - - rather than an actual ukulele . In ' Boots ! Boots ! ' , George actually does play a standard ukulele . The sound is less distinctive than in his later banjolele efforts , but that might be down to the poor recording here . Beryl Formby does a spirited tap-dance to the ' Chinese Laundry Blues ' , showing that her dancing ability is superior to her acting ability , but not by much . The direction and camera-work in this cheapie effort are quite bad , and much of the pacing is bad too . Still , for fans of George Formby , this is a vitally important film . . . and it's an interesting example of no-budget film-making . I'll rate ' Boots ! Boots ! ' .
419587	1609079	148436	8.0	The wenches in the trenches meet the bitches in the ditches .	MGM's war drama ' The Big Parade ' was the single biggest money-maker of Hollywood's silent-film period . ( Actually , ' The Birth of a Nation ' made more money , but the profits were divided among several different distributors . ) Consequently , there were several unrelated movies - - such as ' The Wet Parade ' - - with titles evoking that box-office bonanza . ' The Mad Parade ' was one of them , and ( unlike ' The Wet Parade ' ) it resembles ' The Big Parade ' to the extent that it's also about the Great War . . . but this time from a female viewpoint . The film which ' The Mad Parade ' most nearly resembles is ' The Women ' , in which an all-female cast spent most of their time obsessing over men who remained just offscreen . But that movie took place in a female universe of salons and boutiques . ' The Mad Parade ' sets a bigger challenge : it's a war movie ( traditionally male territory ) with an all-female cast . It would be very contrived to keep men entirely absent from this setting , so ( unlike in ' The Women ' ) we do hear men's offscreen voices , occasionally seeing a man's shadow outlined on the wall , or glimpsing a man's shoulder at the edge of the frame . The setting is a military canteen during the Great War , staffed by women so that men will be available for combat duty . The commander is Schuyler , played by the underrated character actress Irene Rich . Each of the young women on her staff has a distinctly different personality , and much of the drama ( with some comedy relief ) comes from the clash of these personalities under the pressure of war . Monica Dale is nicknamed ' the Duchess ' for her reserved manner . She's romantically involved with Tony , a handsome young aviator . One drawback of this film's all-female conceit is that we know we're never going to see Tony even though we keep hearing about him . Monica's co-worker Janice is jealous and wants Tony for herself . Lilyan Tashman ( whom I've never liked ) supplies some bad comedy relief ; Louise Fazenda's comic playing is more welcome . Fazenda's character is cried Fanny Smithers , a name which would provoke unintended laughter in British cinemas . The film takes pains to establish that these women are in physical danger , just like the men they cater for . A German bombing raid hits the canteen . Monica finds a dud German grenade , and chucks it at a rat . . . but the grenade explodes and kills her co-worker Prudence . One thing I found immensely annoying about this movie is that most of the women are constantly obsessing about romantic entanglements with men , even though they've got far more pressing matters . In fairness , I'm sure that plenty of men in combat zones were thinking about women during lulls in the battle . . . but I'm also sure they put aside those thoughts and got to work when the shooting started . Most of the characters in ' The Mad Parade ' live utterly for male attention . Marceline Day's dialogue reveals her bizarre enunciation . Bill Beaudine's directorial efforts are - - as usual for him - - workmanlike and unimaginative . The editing is poor . But there aren't many films with an all-woman cast , and still fewer of those are war movies . This film's unusual setting and casting go far to raise it above the mundane . Despite its flaws and its derivative title , I'll rate ' The Mad Parade ' .
419507	1609079	10662	8.0	Well above D . W . Griffith's usual standard .	I saw DW Griffith's ' Scarlet Days ' in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto film festival in Sacile , Italy . The festival screened a print supplied by the Museum of Modern Art , in New York City . Some words of caution are in order , however . ' Scarlet Days ' was never one of Griffith's more important nor more profitable productions . After Griffith's production company failed , no American archive attempted to preserve a print of this movie , and it soon became ' lost ' . As so often happens with ' lost ' American films , a print turned up in the Gosfilmofond archive in Russia . ( This one in 1972 , I think . ) Since the Soviet Union never honoured U . S . copyrights ; Russian film exhibitors seldom bothered to return the prints of American films distributed to Soviet cinemas . The Gosfilmofond print of ' Scarlet Days ' contained Russian intertitles rather than the English-language originals . The Museum of Modern Art possess a transcript of Griffith's title sheets for this film , but it's not clear whether these titles are the ones which accompanied its original U . S . release . ( Griffith was notorious for constantly revising his own work . ) At any rate , the MoMA print which I saw in Italy contains crude reconstructions of the MoMA titles , difficult to read and unattractive to the eye . If the following review contains any inaccuracies , please note that I saw a print with the ' wrong ' titles . Eugenie Besserer plays Rosie Nell , a dance-hall matron in the southwestern U . S . in the 19th century . The film manages to imply that Rosie Nell is more than merely a dance-hall girl - - i . e . , she's either a madam or a prostitute , or both - - but is evasive about this . Rosie Nell's business rival is one Spasm Sal , and here we have a female version of the old ' good crook / bad crook ' cliché . Even though Nell and Sal are in the same line of work , we're meant to sympathise with Nell while dismissing Sal as just cheap baggage . Like Mrs Warren in George Bernard Shaw's play , Rosie Nell does what she does in order to buy a finer life for her daughter , whom she is careful to keep at a distance so as to protect her purity . Played by Griffith's perpetual ingenue Carol Dempster , the daughter ( with a maidenhead of corrugated steel ) is lumbered with the ridiculous name Lady Fair . Lady Fair has been raised by a kindly aunt , on the money sent to her by Rosie Nell . This set-up topples into bathos when we see that the gaudy bawdy Rosie Nell keeps a small trove of ' respectable ' frocks buried deep in her closet for her visits with her daughter . Meanwhile , Richard Barthelmess - - the DIY Chinese in ' Broken Blossoms ' - - is cast here as a DIY Mexican named Alvarez , a local bandito . We're meant to accept that Alvarez - - like Zorro and the Cisco Kid , or like Robin Hood - - is a ' good ' crook who only robs those who deserve to be robbed , and who supposedly distributes his largess to the poor . Here again , on the male side of the cast list , we have the ' good crook / bad crook ' contrast . Whilst Alvarez is ostensibly a ' good ' crook , he is contrasted with King Bagley ( played by sack-faced Walter Long ) , who's just a crook full stop . Naturally , Long lusts for Lady Fair . Offscreen , actor Carol Dempster was rumoured to be DW Griffith's mistress : in his films , Griffith often cast the flat-chested Dempster as the vehicle for his rather peculiar notions about virginal maidenhood . In a few of their films , Griffith arranged to have Dempster's ingenue characters threatened with rape . . . never successfully , of course . We get an early hint of this in ' Scarlet Days ' when Walter Long ( who also played the would-be rapist in Griffith's ' Birth of a Nation ' ) brutally inserts his knee between the ruffles of Dempster's skirt . For Griffith's original audience , this must have been very shocking indeed . Later , Long's villain attempts to rape her . . . and the rape scene here is far more detailed and explicit than the rape scene in Griffith's and Dempster's ' Sally of the Sawdust ' . Long pulls the bodice of Dempster's dress off her shoulders , then lifts her skirt and petticoats . In a 21st-century movie , this would merely be business as usual ( rated PG ) . For a film made in 1919 , and especially one made by the sexually reticent Griffith , I found this scene to be shockingly explicit . Allegedly , the character played by Barthelmess in this movie is based on one or more genuine historic figures of the Old West . I have my doubts about that part . There are plenty of gentlemen highwaymen - - Jesse James in the States , Dick Turpin in England - - who , upon closer inspection , turn out to have been just thieving brutes after all . ' Scarlet Days ' is atypical of DW Griffith's work , and manages to avoid some of his more annoying excesses . There are a few credibility problems in the script , but perhaps these would have been cleared up if I'd viewed a print with the original title cards . ' Billy ' Bitzer's cinematography is up to his usual high standard here . My rating for this one : .
418272	1609079	18535	8.0	Gondo-leery	' Venus of Venice ' ( great title ! ) is a slick caper comedy , briskly directed by Marshall ' Mickey ' Neilan at the peak of his powers . The characters are implausible - - and ' Venice ' is clearly a studio set - - but this movie takes place in the same tinselled sham-glam world as Lubitsch's ' Trouble in Paradise ' , a film with a plot and premise very similar to this one . Constance Talmadge stars as Carlotta , a Venetian petty thief who's known to the constabulary as ' the Water Rat ' . She works with an older partner , Marco , who pretends to be a blind beggar . After they rob a wealthy victim , Carlotta makes her getaway by diving into the nearest canal . . . hence her nickname . This being Venice , there's no shortage of canals . SPOILERS COMING . This is one of those movies where our sympathies are supposed to be with the crook . All goes well for Carlotta until she crosses paths with Kenneth Wilson , an American . ( Played by Antonio Moreno , whose Spanish accent was no liability in this silent film . ) Wilson is a painter , and this movie takes place in the fantasy realm where handsome sensitive artists always have plenty of spending money . Carlotta sets her sights on robbing Wilson , so she pretends to be attracted to him . But then she actually does fall for him , and is dismayed when he spurns her . But then , eventually . . . guess what . There are no surprises in the plot , but this film is stylish and snappy . I had difficulty believing that this movie's art director had ever been to Venice , but the fake Venice depicted in this film is attractive in its own right . I'll rate this sparkling movie .
418942	1609079	148633	8.0	The bathtub keeps growing	' The Power of Thought ' is the most imaginative of the Heckle and Jeckle cartoons : not their funniest , but the one that most fully utilises the potential of character animation . . . making this cartoon the Terrytoons equivalent of Bob Clampett's ' The Big Snooze ' . Heckle and Jeckle are lazing about the house one day ( they live in surprisingly expansive quarters ) when Jeckle has an epiphany : ' We're cartoon characters ! We ought to take advantage of the situation . ' To demonstrate his theory to Heckle , Jeckle morphs into a puppy dog , then a one-man ( one-magpie ? ) band . Now that Heckle and Jeckle realise that they have infinite power to create anything they want , they straight away wish for . . . a hot bath . ' And it's just the temperature I like it , too , ' says Heckle as the bathtub materialises around them . They begin some synchronised swimming , and the bathtub obligingly elongates for them . . . breaking through the upstairs wall and then stretching out into the street beyond , where the bathwater spills onto a bulldog in a constable's uniform . SPOILERS COMING . The two strengths of Heckle and Jeckle were always their slapstick violence and their anarchic repartee , both of which are in short supply here . Basically , they use their cartoon-character powers to humiliate the cop . . . until he realises that he's a cartoon character too , with the same powers , so he can turn the tables on the magpies . ' The Power of Thought ' is enjoyable for adults and intelligent kids . I fear that most kids nowadays are likely more interested in video games or mindless japanimation . I'll rate ' The Power of Thought ' .
419509	1609079	22915	8.0	Stymie stymies the Unholy Four .	I'm not a major fan of Hal Roach's " Our Gang " comedies - - the so-called Little Rascals - - and I usually avoid the Rascals in any movie that shows them eating . I have no desire to watch their table manners , and most of the " gags " are very predictable : close-up of white kid with dark food smeared on his face , followed by close-up of black kid with white food smeared on his face . So , the title " Free Eats " did not whet my appetite . Fortunately , the Rascals are in good hands here : " Free Eats " is directed by Leo McCarey's unjustly-obscure brother Raymond , and the dialogue is by Roach stalwart H . M . " Beany " Walker . An opening shot of a newspaper informs us that Mrs Stanford L Clark is throwing a free feed for the local kids , to help her husband's political campaign for the mayoralty . Now , there are these four crooks who decide to crash the kids-only party . All four crooks are adult men , but two of them are midgets disguised as babies . The other two men pretend to be the " parents " of the babies , with Paul Fix in female disguise as the mama . Oh , mama ! Over the decades of his long career , veteran character actor Paul Fix had a wide range of roles : he was Liz Taylor's father in ' Giant ' , and he was cast as chief medical officer aboard the Starship Enterprise until he got replaced by DeForest Kelley . I was very impressed with Fix's performance in the 1929 drama ' Lucky Star ' . Here , disguised as a woman , he gives a much more plausible performance than I would have expected . Fix actually attempts a few gestures that are convincingly feminine rather than effeminate . The two midgets ( one of them twice the size of the other ) aren't very plausible as babies . They keep showing off their adult teeth . ( Harry Earles , another adult midget who was sometimes cast as a genuine baby , purposely avoided showing his teeth while in infant roles . ) Both midgets are spectacularly ugly . At least one speaks in a dubbed voice , probably because most midget performers aren't very good actors . ( They tend to get cast for reasons unrelated to acting ability . ) The two midgets steal the jewellery of Mrs Clark and her society friends . . . knowing that , if they're caught in the act , they'll be mistaken for innocent babies snatching pretty objects . The alleged ' father ' of the midgets is veteran actor Billy Gilbert , giving a surprisingly subdued performance . Gilbert typically overacted and often played blustering idiots , but he was actually a highly intelligent man : I suspect that , finding himself here cast alongside two midgets and a female impersonator , he was smart enough to realise he should play it straight this time . What really strained credulity for me is that we see Fix and the midgets ALREADY disguised as a woman and her two babies when Billy Gilbert finds out about the party . Do they live in these disguises full-time ? Hmmm . . . I was intrigued to see good performances here from a couple of kid actors whom I don't recognise from other ' Our Gang ' movies . Dorothy DeBorba ( looking a little bit like Carl ' Alfalfa ' Switzler ) is bright and pop-eyed as the head girl . Sherwood Bailey , nicknamed Spud and dressed as a jockey , is the leader of the kid gang . The climax of the movie is genuinely suspenseful , with Bailey getting into a knock-down fight with the nastier of the two midgets . Here we see an adult criminal ( admittedly a midget in nappies ) trying to beat up a child , and we recognise that Spud is in genuine peril . Bailey gives an excellent performance : why didn't he catch on as one of Our Gang ? I'm never amused when Matthew ' Stymie ' Beard or some other black child is used as the butt of racial humour in these crude comedies . In ' Free Eats ' , intriguingly , young Stymie proves himself a brave and resourceful detective . He's the first to realise that the ' babies ' are not what they seem , and he comes up with a clever method of unmasking them . . . or maybe undiapering them . ' Free Eats ' is one of the more original Our Gang comedies , and this non-fan happily rates it .
419549	1609079	150887	8.0	Ruling the roost in a coop d'etat	I'm a fan of Arnold Stang , but I dislike the Uncle Herman cartoons for which he provided the main character's voice . All the cartoons putting Uncle Herman at odds with Katnip the Cat have exactly the same boring plot . ' The Henpecked Rooster ' , at least , is a Herman cartoon which places the character in a different situation , and which offers some interesting character dynamics . Henry the rooster is bullied by his unnamed wife ( Henrietta ? ) , who summons him by shouting ' Hen-REEEE ! ' in an imitation of Henry Aldrich's mother . I agree with previous IMDb reviewer Robert Reynolds that the uncredited actor who voices Henry was probably Jack Mercer ; however , the actor is definitely imitating radio performer Bill Thompson : specifically , Thompson's portrayal of Wally Wimple , the henpecked husband from the ' Fibber McGee and Molly ' radio programme . Henry does all the housework while his wife reads a book titled ' How to Lay an Egg , by Bob Hope ' . ( That's the best gag in this cartoon . ) At this point , the score ( by Winston Sharples ) offers a snatch of ' Thanks for the Memory ' . When a mouse ( Herman ) shows up , the hen orders her husband to get rid of him . But Herman offers to help Henry reverse the balance of power in his chicken coop ( a coop d'etat ? ) . Soon enough , Henry is bullying his wife , and cheerfully enjoying the reversal . Paramount's cartoons from this period have never impressed me , yet I actually found myself intrigued by ' The Henpecked Rooster ' because my sympathies changed as the characters ' relationships changed . I felt sorry for henpecked Henry , but then lost all sympathy for him when he bullied his wife . There's also a surprisingly clever ending , when the toon appears to end with a typical iris-in , but one more unexpected gag completely changes the fates of all the characters . And there's some really superb scoring here by Sharples ; at one point , when Herman whispers a scheme to Henry ( so we can't hear it ) , Sharples's staccato music substitutes for Herman's voice . Sharples scores the whole cartoon very imaginatively and effectively . ' The Henpecked Rooster ' is quite misogynist ( certainly not the only cartoon to be guilty of that trait ) but it's much better than I expected , and I'll rate it .
419426	1609079	222651	8.0	Too good to be fiction !	I saw ' The White Rabbit ' when it was originally televised on the Beeb , and would happily watch it again if it were given a repeat transmission . However , considering Auntie Beeb's penchant for taping over her original recordings , I doubt that ' The White Rabbit ' still exists . Here's hoping . The IMDb credits correctly state that this miniseries is adapted from Bruce Marshall's book of the same name , but the credits wrongly identify Marshall's book as a novel . It's non-fiction , right enough - - some of it all TOO real - - although Marshall wrote it in the same novelised format made famous in Truman Capote's ' In Cold Blood ' . Kenneth More gives possibly the best performance of his career as Frederick Yeo-Thomas , a Welshman who volunteers for a dangerous undercover mission in Nazi-occupied Paris . ( ' The White Rabbit ' is his code name . ) ' Tommy ' is ordered to liaise with the Resistance . . . but he swiftly gets betrayed , and is handed over to the Gestapo for interrogation . From there , he's on his way to a death camp . The entire miniseries is taut and suspenseful , but I was especially impressed by one scene - - apparently a true incident - - during Yeo-Thomas's interrogation . In his undercover identity as a Frenchman , ' Tommy ' has a supply of French banknotes : intentionally rumpled and used , as crisp notes would be too conspicuous . One of his ten-franc notes has a ' phone number scribbled on it by a previous possessor . After Yeo-Thomas is captured and searched , the Gestapo naturally assume that this is the ' phone number for his contact . With impressive and terrible swiftness , they track down the Parisian to whom this ' phone number was issued . He turns out to be a meek little cabaret musician , played brilliantly by John Barrard . There is a harrowing sequence in which More is forced to watch while Barrard - - an utter stranger , who doesn't know him and doesn't have any tactical secrets - - is manhandled by Gestapo officers who demand he give up secrets he doesn't possess . Just because somebody wrote his ' phone number on a banknote ! It's a shame that the true story of the courageous Frederick Yeo-Thomas isn't better known . I'll rate this taut mini-series , and I should be delighted to watch it again .
419140	1609079	215038	8.0	Walk through this with me	Marcel Aymé ( pronounced ' Ah-may ' ) was France's equivalent to Thorne Smith . Aymé wrote fantasy stories which , like Smith's , tended to feature unobtrusive men whose lives are irrevocably changed by an unexpected encounter with the supernatural , not always ending happily but usually with a bit of sex along the way . There are also distinct similarities between Aymé's works and the stories of James Thurber . Some of Aymé's best stories , intriguingly , were written during the Nazi occupation . ( This is especially evident in his bitter story ' La Carte ' . ) My own favourite Aymé tale is ' La Grace ' , about an ordinary man - a decent individual , but hardly a candidate for sainthood - who suddenly finds himself equipped with an unwanted halo . Desperate to get rid of this inconvenience , he proceeds to commit every imaginable sin . . . but can't get rid of that halo . The TV production ' Le Passe-muraille ' , a one-off comedy , adapts Aymé's story of the same name , his best-known tale . Its title would roughly translate into English as ' The Passer-Through-Walls ' . This same story was adapted into the musical ' Amour ' , which flopped quickly on Broadway in 2002 . It's not hard to see why : ' Le Passe-muraille ' is a charming bit of froth , without the substance or plot line to sustain a full-length evening . Monsieur Dutilleul ( Michel Serrault ) is a typical Aymé hero : an obscure little clerk , a Parisian version of Cosmo Topper or a less imaginative version of Walter Mitty . One night in his flat , with the lights out , Dutilleul finds himself in the wrong room and can't account for how he got there . After some experimentation , it dawns on him that he can walk through walls . He never does learn how or when he acquired this ability . Being a creature of habit , Dutilleul goes to see a doctor ( Jean Obé ) , who blithely prescribes pills for this unusual condition . More as a failure of nerve than a desire to retain his new ability , Dutilleul accepts the pills but does not swallow them . Shyly at first , Dutilleul experiments with his newfound power to walk through walls . There is a very funny scene in which Dutilleul is summoned to his boss's office and slated for a minor matter . Returning to his own office to lick his wounds , Dutilleul has a clever idea . He sticks his head through the intervening wall , confronting his boss in the form of a head on the wall , like a taxidermy trophy . ' Sir , you are an idiot ! ' Dutilleul remarks , then recedes into the wall again . When the apoplectic boss rushes to Dutilleul's office , everything is of course normal . . . and Dutilleul feigns innocence . As Dutilleul becomes bolder in his ghostly ventures , he commits daring burglaries . . . eventually frightening all of Paris , as rumours spread of a super-thief known only as Garou-Garou ( roughly , the Werewolf ) . Of course , it dawns on Dutilleul that his new ability can benefit his sex life . Like the original story , this television comedy is quite funny until the ending , at which point ( again like the original ) it becomes quite bitter . The special effects in the wall-walking sequences are very poorly done - ' Twilight Zone ' did this sort of thing much better , more than a decade earlier - but this does no harm to the story's basic enjoyabilty . A nice bit of singing by Jean-Marc Recchia at the end . I'll rate this telefilm .
418422	1609079	10061	8.0	See me , hear me , touch me	There is a damaged and incomplete print of this film in the Library of Congress ; some effort is underway to make it available on video . It's a shame that the 1919 film ' Deliverance ' has the same title as a much better-known film about hillbilly sodomites . ' Deliverance ' ( this one ) is a clumsily-made film , poorly paced , yet it's absolutely compelling because of the true story behind it . This film is the life story of Helen Keller , made with her active participation . Inevitably , this movie covers the same ground as the much better-known ' The Miracle Worker ' . ' Deliverance ' is organised in a triptych format , depicting Helen Keller's life in three acts : as a child , as a young woman , and in the present day ( 1919 ) when she is an inspirational world figure . We see Helen at age six ( played by a very impressive child actress ) , utterly blind and deaf from infancy : mute , cut off from nearly all human contact . ( Ms Keller lost her eyesight and hearing to scarlet fever , but this is not adequately explained in the film . ) We see the famous scene in which Anne Sullivan pumps water into Helen's hand whilst spelling out the manual alphabet word for ' water ' into her fingers . Despite the tableau staging , these scenes are profoundly moving because we recognise them as real events . The early sequences are largely marred by the depiction of some stereotypical black servants in the Keller household . In real life , Keller's father had been an officer in the Confederate army , but somehow I find the Keller family's servants more servile than they need to be for a story set in this time and place . The middle sequence shows Helen Keller in her 20s , now able to speak ( crudely ) and attending college with Anne Sullivan translating the texts into Braille for her . This film does not dwell on the central irony of Helen Keller's life : namely that , in order for her to interact with the world , another person ( Anne Sullivan ) had to dedicate her own eyes and ears to Helen Keller's purposes . Also , because this is a silent film , we are all necessarily deafened along with Ms Keller , and cannot fully grasp the isolation of her own silent existence within the world of hearing people ( as this entire film is set in silence ) . I've heard Hellen Keller's voice in some sound-era newsreels : it's a shame that ' Deliverance ' ( lacking a soundtrack ) is unable fully to convey her efforts to be able to speak coherently whilst unable to hear her own words . In the final and most inspirational sequence , we see the real Helen Keller working tirelessly as a public figure to improve conditions for other blind people , and helping them to learn useful trades . ( Another irony : none of those blind people could have appreciated this film . ) Speaking directly to the camera , she also conveys ( via silent-film titles ) her belief in an almighty and benevolent deity . What a remarkable woman Helen Keller was . Much of ' Deliverance ' is clumsy , but every frame of this movie is fascinating , and some of it is positively riveting . I'll rate ' Deliverance ' .
418502	1609079	69483	8.0	Brilliant enactment of Thurber's ' Last Flower '	' The War Between Men and Women ' was originally a suite of drawings by cartoonist / author James Thurber , depicting quite literally an all-out war between the two sexes . Thurber was an embittered misogynist ( as well as a philanderer ) , so it's no surprise that he ended his " War " with the women offering unconditional surrender to the men . During his boyhood in Ohio , Thurber's older brother bullied him into a stupid game that cost young James an eye and seriously infected his other eye . Thurber's mother , for her own stupid reasons , delayed getting her son medical treatment for his surviving eye . ( This may be one reason why he hated women . ) For the rest of his life , Thurber experienced increasing blindness in his one eye , eventually requiring an enormous magnifying lens in order to see his own cartoons as he drew them . In addition to hating women , Thurber disliked most men too : one of his favourite tricks at social functions was to goad the most popular man in the room until the man was provoked into hitting Thurber . . . thus becoming a social pariah for assaulting a blind man . The 1972 film ' The War Between Men and Women ' is an intriguing comedy-drama , an intelligent attempt to do something different . . . that ultimately fails . Part of the problem is this movie's deeply misleading title , which seems to promise sexual come-ons that never arrive . The central character ( played by Jack Lemmon ) is clearly inspired by the life and works of James Thurber , yet is significantly different from Thurber . ( For one thing , he's a much nicer guy . ) It's clear that scriptwriters Danny Arnold and Mel Shavelson have a deep love for Thurber's work . Shortly before this film , they had worked on the brilliant ( though unsuccessful ) TV series ' My World and Welcome to It ' , deeply inspired by Thurber's writings and cartoons . Shavelson had tried to dramatise Thurber's work at least as far back as ' Christabel ' , a 1959 episode of ' Goodyear Theatre ' . Peter Wilson ( Lemmon ) is a cartoonist / author who is trying not to deal with the fact that he's going blind . An operation might save his sight , or it might accelerate the deterioration of his remaining vision . He has an annoying ' meet cute ' with Terry Kozlenko ( Barbara Harris ) , a divorcée with three disaffected children . A romance develops between Peter and Terry , with Peter attempting to be a surrogate father to her kids . But their father ( Jason Robards ) isn't completely out of the picture : he's a macho journalist whose book of war photographs is a best-seller . Lemmon brilliantly depicts mounting frustration as Peter realises that he and his twee storybooks can't compete with the derring-do of Terry's first husband . A fine performance as Terry's son David is given by an extremely talented child actor with the ill-fitting name Moosie Drier . ( He doesn't in any way resemble a moose ; why this name ? ) SLIGHT SPOILER COMING . At one point , Peter attempts a father-son talk with David while they stroll along a quay : suddenly David slips and falls into the water . . . and he can't swim ! The look on Lemmon's face is astonishing , as the nearly blind Peter realises it's up to him to save the drowning boy . The best performance in this film is given by Lisa Gerritsen , a dynamically talented child actress who was also in ' My World and Welcome to It ' . ( Gerritsen , now an adult , reportedly has cut all ties to her thespian career . ) Terry's daughter Linda ( Gerritsen ) feels stigmatised by her speech impediment ; Peter feels a bond with her because of his own encroaching blindness . In this film's most lyrical scene , Peter attempts to convey the act of creativity to Linda through his picturebook story ' The Last Flower ' . This is actually an apocalyptic tale written and drawn by Thurber , brought to life here by splendid animation . In addition to despising women , James Thurber was a dog-lover . The funniest line in this movie occurs when Peter and Terry take her pregnant dog for a walk . Co-scripter Danny Arnold makes a cameo appearance as a cop , giving himself the chance to speak this line : a line that's not in James Thurber's writings , but which is so bluntly misogynist that Thurber would have howled in glee if he'd heard it . Despite this film's misleading title , the makers of ' The War Between Men and Women ' showed real guts in attempting this unusual story . Based solely on my own tastes , I'll rate it . Now , if someone would make a film version of Thurber's ' The Wonderful O ' , I could die happy .
418840	1609079	15935	8.0	a Chile reception	I saw ' Hussar of the Dead ' at the 2006 Cinema Muto silent-film festival in Sacile , Italy , where it was definitely one of the high points of the excellent festival . This Chilean silent movie was at least the third film version ( and the second by actor-director-author Pedro Sienna ) depicting the life of Chilean hero Manuel Rodriguez , who fought for Chile's independence from Spain and was assassinated in 1818 . The print I viewed had some missing sequences , and new titles added to bridge the gaps . The original intertitles ( in Spanish ) appear directly on the film , superimposed ( in white ) over the actors . This device never works very well , because the portions of the letters appearing over a white image are illegible . I'm fluent in Spanish , yet I had trouble reading all the titles because of this device . At one point , a title flips over on its vertical axis to reveal a second title . I've seen this visual device ( not really a very expensive one ) in several Hollywood silents and a few British ones , but never before in any other nation's films . Pedro Sienna cast himself in the title role of this movie , but that's no vanity casting . He gives a fine performance : lithe , virile , and reasonably handsome without the supernaturally good looks of a Tyrone Power . There's also an astonishingly good performance by an amateur child actor , Guillermo Barrientos , as a boy who hero-worships Rodriguez . I know almost nothing about Chilean history , so I can't vouch for this film's accuracy . I was mildly annoyed that - - as depicted here - - Rodriguez seemingly possessed the supernatural ability always to pop up in just the right place at the right time , no matter how many guards he must get past . In this respect , he seemed more like the ( fictional ) Scarlet Pimpernel than an historical figure . But I laughed at a montage sequence - - an intentionally funny one - - in which a series of dissolves show Rodriguez in several different disguises . The misleading title ' Hussar of the Dead ' refers to the fact that Rodriguez had a price on his head and was technically a dead man walking , or rather riding . How come Hollywood hasn't made a movie about this man yet ? If ever they do , bet on them to change all the facts . I'll rate this entertaining movie , and I'd like to know just how accurate it truly is .
419612	1609079	27557	8.0	Magyar self at home	' Danube Rendezvous ' is froth , notably only because it offers some interesting views of Budapest circa 1936 , and because it shows that Hungarians were able to indulge in such frivolity at a time when events in Germany and Austria were getting very serious indeed . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . Zita Perczel ( an attractive blonde actress ) plays Erzsi , the daughter of pompous businessman Sandor . She wants to marry Istvan Bodo , a handsome young novelist . Just now , this particular novelist is struggling ( aren't they all ? ) , but the pengoes are sure to come rolling in just as soon as Istvan publishes his latest novel . ( Oh , so that's how it works . ) Sandor , showing what his priorities are , makes it plain that he consents to his daughter's marriage to this bum ( I mean this novelist ) only providing that Istvan's novel is a success . Actor Gyula Csortos - - who reminds me of Edward Arnold - - gives a good performance as Erzsi's father : he makes it quite clear that he's giving his conditional consent only because he's confident that the novel will never sell . But then the book gets published , to favourable reviews , and suddenly Sandor must scramble to sabotage the novel's success so as to block the marriage . Why doesn't he just withdraw his consent ? Come to that , if Istvan becomes financially successful , why does Erzsi even need her father's consent ? There's a funny performance by Gyula Kabos as Szalai , the publisher's publicity agent . He runs an advert in the Budapest papers , purporting to be a personal ad from a ( nonexistent ) wealthy young man seeking matrimony if he can find just the right young woman : a woman like the heroine in Istvan Bodo's novel . Naturally , this causes a run on book sales , as mercenary women hope to read the novel so as to pattern themselves after its heroine . There's a ' surprise ' ending that's really no surprise at all . Thanks to Szalai , Istvan's novel sells so well that Istvan is now a wealthy young man seeking matrimony : just like the guy in the ad . And - - surprise , surprise - - he based his novel's heroine on Erzsi . So , the young man in the advertisement ( guess who ) does indeed marry a woman just like the one in the novel ( guess who ) . I could see this coming from the other side of the Danube . As I say , this is froth , and it certainly has its charms without expanding the sum total of cinema craft . Good performances all round , and some impressive direction and exteriors . ' Danube Rendezvous ' achieves what it sets out to do : entertain audiences , and nothing more . I'll rate this movie .
418383	1609079	34631	8.0	Excellent voice work by Bletcher and Blanc .	" Daffy's Southern Exposure " is one of the funnier Daffy Duck toons from his black and white period . There are two errors in the IMDb description of this cartoon : the animal who tries to cook and eat Daffy here is a wolf , not a fox . . . and the voice of the wolf is supplied not by Mel Blanc but by ( uncredited ) Billy Bletcher , who also did the voice for Disney's Big Bad Wolf a few years earlier . Daffy has made the seemingly sensible decision not to fly south for the winter , because later he'll just have to fly north again , and so forth . But . . . " You'll be sorry ! " gloat a Greek chorus of ducks , just before their seasonal migration . Next thing we know , Daffy's caught in a blizzard right up to his gizzard . " Daffy's Southern Exposure " was released in 1942 , when a substantial portion of the audience still remembered silent movies . I was intrigued that the plot of this cartoon is advanced via the device of a silent-film intertitle ; it works gracefully enough here ( and includes a nice gag ) , but might have been jarring if used only a few years later , when the Warner toons were being made in colour . Seeking shelter and sustenance , Daffy ends up in a cabin inhabited by a locquacious wolf with an unlimited supply of beans but no meat . The wolf is partnered by a weasel who doesn't talk . For some reason , there seems to be a long cartoon tradition of teaming a speaking character with a partner who's either mute or only speaks incoherently . This is true not only at Warners ( with Sniffles the mouse and his speechless worm companion ) but at other studios as well . The wolf and the weasel in " Daffy's Southern Exposure " show real potential as characters who could have returned in later Warners toons , but their potential is undercut by the fact that the weasel remains silent . ( This tradition of a ' silent partner ' does not apply to Harpo Marx , who is never silent because - - although remaining mute - - he always makes as much noise as possible . ) It's a shame that Billy Bletcher receives no screen credit for his voice-work here , as his performance is excellent . The wolf dons a Granny disguise , requiring Bletcher to speak in falsetto . While the wolf is en femme , Bletcher performs a rapid patter song with a complicated lyric , singing it entirely in falsetto . He's excellent ! What a pity that so few people are familiar with this comedian's name and work . Mel Blanc does fine voice work here , too : wait'll you hear how he applies Daffy's speech impediment to the word " sustenance " . The slapstick in " Daffy's Southern Exposure " is well up to the usual Warners standard , with less violence than usual for a carnivorous plot line . I'll rate this one .
418842	1609079	8918	9.0	She flips for him . . . pancakes , I mean .	I saw this film at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . The very popular William S . Hart was something of an anomaly among silent-film stars . Whereas most male silent stars tended to play either exclusively good guys or exclusively baddies , Hart usually played characters who started out bad but were reformed by the love of a good woman before the last reel . Offscreen , Hart had the bizarre habit of proposing marriage to his leading ladies . In ' Branding Broadway ' , Hart plays a rootin'-tootin ' sixgun-shootin ' rancher from the Triple Bar X ranch who rides into Whetstone , Arizona in search of a drink , pausing only to address some Chinese immigrants as " Chinkos " . The local goo-goo committee hog-tie Hart and toss him into a baggage van bound for New York . In the city , Hart gets a job as " nurse " to a tough playboy who likes to start stosh-ups in nightclubs . ( Why do they keep letting him in ? ) The playboy has written some compromising letters to pretty Seena Owen , who demonstrates her skill flipping flapjacks in a restaurant called the Wheat Cake . ( Where a stack o ' wheats will set you back 20 cents . ) When the playboy's father sends Hart to retrieve the letters , Hart takes one squizz at pretty Seena and . . . Katie , bar the door ! I hugely enjoyed this film , which is a nice urban change of pace for the outdoorsman Hart , but still features enough action to keep his fans happy . There are a couple of nice stock shots of Manhattan , and some funny jokes in the intertitles . If not for that " Chinkos " line , I might have rated this movie a perfect 10 . As it is , .
418799	1609079	357	9.0	Has her lower half got a sister ?	I viewed the British Film Institute print of this early ' trick ' film . This brief and enjoyable comedy is purely a vehicle for some conjuring tricks , all of which are achieved in the camera rather than through stagecraft . The tricks are well done , with the jump cuts and other fakery being rather more difficult to spot here than in many other ' trick ' films of this same era . The Edison Company's synopsis , included on IMDb's web page for this film , is accurate enough . I was intrigued by the business featuring a beautiful woman divided into upper and lower halves . This impressed me for two different reasons . Firstly , the earliest example ( to my knowledge ) of a stage conjuror sawing a woman in half was P . T . Selbit , about 20 years AFTER this movie was made : is it possible that the well-known stage illusion was actually inspired by this movie ? Secondly , I was intrigued that this movie was imaginative enough to introduce the top half of the woman without the bottom half , and then show her bottom half walking into the scene . This is much more clever ( and unexpected ) than the more obvious lurk of showing a normal woman , then making her divide into halves . Compare this with the awful scene in ' Follow the Boys ' when Orson Welles supposedly saws Marlene Dietrich in half , in front of a live audience of servicemen . Marlene's lower half gets up and walks away , while the soldiers hoot with delight . . . but this is blatantly a camera trick , so we know that the ' audience ' aren't seeing what we're seeing , and we know they're giving a scripted reaction . The magic tricks in ' The Haunted Curiosity Shop ' are actually more convincing than the make-up job on the actor playing the antiques dealer . My rating : .
419015	1609079	29744	9.0	Demarest funny , Winchell phony	Walter Winchell started in vaudeville as a performer in Gus Edwards's ' School Days ' act . ( A fictionalised version of this remarkable troupe became Bing Crosby's movie ' The Star Maker ' . ) Between engagements , Winchell wrote and published a vaudeville newsletter , filled with showbiz gossip . He eventually became a newspaper / radio columnist , utterly ruthless in his power , quick to destroy an enemy's career and ( less frequently ) to aid a friend . ( The Broadway revue ' Hellzapoppin ' was trashed by all the critics , yet ran for more than 3 years because Winchell plugged it in his column every single day . ) Although many actors and entertainers desperately coveted a mention in Winchell's column , nearly everyone in show business despised him . ( Ed Sullivan once threatened to shove Winchell's head into a toilet . ) Winchell wisely avoided feuding with his many enemies , aware that such action would only give them free publicity . One of Winchell's few real friends was popular radio bandleader Ben Bernie , and the two concocted a public ' feud ' that was a long-running publicity stunt for them both . Several movies - most notably ' Sweet Smell of Success ' and ' Blessed Event ' - feature fictional journalists who are blatantly based upon Winchell . ' Wake Up and Live ' , an above-average Fox musical , features Winchell and Bernie playing themselves . . . or , rather , fictionalised versions of themselves , designed to make Winchell look good and their phony feud look genuine . In a staged scene , Winchell rattles off his extensive knowledge of obscure nightclub acts while identifying a masked singer after hearing only a few notes . In another scene - equally staged , but funny - a shifty promoter played by Walter Catlett tries to offer Winchell a bribe . Winchell takes the money but immediately drops it into a charity poorbox . Catlett attempts to retrieve the cash , only to attract the interest of a passing policeman . This scene pays tribute to one of Winchell's few genuine redeeming traits : he was active for many charitable causes . ( Winchell founded the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund . ) It's fascinating to see Winchell onscreen , even though he's clearing playing a sanitised version of himself . To see him here , you'd never guess he bullied his daughter unmercifully and drove his son to suicide . Although Winchell and Bernie are prominently featured , the frothy plotline centres on Jack Haley as a would-be radio vocalist and Alice Faye as the singer who encourages him . The sexy and vivacious Faye sings the bouncy title tune . There's a very funny scene in which Haley arrives at the radio station , hoping to audition , when he runs afoul of a sour-tempered studio usher . The usher is played by none other than William Demarest , in his usual mode . It's astonishing to realise that , as late as 1937 , Demarest was still playing bit parts like this one . . . still , he's very welcome here in his brief scene . Demarest assures Haley that his audition will go well , providing he doesn't get mike fright . . . a phenomenon which he then describes to Haley . So , of course , as soon as Haley tries to sing he develops mike fright . There's a delightfully surrealistic sequence in which we see the microphone from Haley's viewpoint , as it morphs into a snarling demon ! There are some lively but irrelevant speciality acts , including a couple of dance routines that would never perform on an actual radio show . Lots of familiar faces in the cast list , and Patsy Kelly is less annoying than usual . The title song is the only good one here . One interesting trivia note : the opening credits of this movie feature two guys from the art department named Mark-Lee Kirk and Haldane Douglas , and their names are stacked onscreen so that ' Kirk ' is directly above ' Douglas ' . I wonder if a certain dimple-chinned actor , just aspiring to a film career at this point , took his screen name from the credits of this movie ? I'll rate ' Wake Up and Live ' .
418486	1609079	35441	9.0	A star at age 13 !	There are some remarkable similarities between Sally Ann Howes and Julie Andrews . Both began their careers as singing ingenues in the same era . Julie's stepfather Ted Andrews was a radio entertainer ; Sally Ann's father Bobby Howes starred in West End musicals , playing a character similar to Eddie Cantor's but less brash and more wistful . Sally Ann Howe's most famous film is ' Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ' , which is a clear attempt to copy the formula of ' Mary Poppins ' . ' Thursday's Child ' is Sally Ann Howes's film debut : at age 13 , she proves herself an astonishingly accomplished actress of almost supernatural beauty . She is cast here as Fennis Wilson , the younger daughter of a tradesman's family . Her 20-year-old sister Phoebe has ambitions to become a film actress , and wangles an audition at Elstree Studios . As part of a ruse to prevent her mother from chaperoning , Phoebe brings Fennis along to the studio . Meanwhile , Elstree are seeking a child actress to star in ' Strange Barrier ' ( sounds like a science-fiction film ) . A casting director ( with an annoyingly exaggerated Bow Bells accent ) spots Fennis waiting for her sister . He persuades Fennis to read for the role , and . . . a star is born ! This premise might seem unbelievable , were it not for the very real talent of Sally Ann Howes . Fennis is soon offered a contract , at 50 pounds weekly : an astonishing sum for wartime Britain . Fennis's father is a dispensing chemist ( a druggist ) , played by Wilfrid Lawson : there's a very touching scene in which he carefully measures drugs onto his balance scales while pondering the fact that his daughter has a chance to make more money in a few months than his father made in an entire year . SPOILERS COMING . Frustrated actress Phoebe becomes envious of her younger sister's success . Eventually , Phoebe leaves home . . . with no money and no prospects , a vulnerable young woman who will be easy prey for any man on the make . Oddly , this subplot is left unresolved at the end of the film . Stewart Granger is in the cast of this film , but he appears only briefly . Much better here is underrated character actor Anthony Holles as a man who counsels Fennis's mother on the consequences of her daughter's sudden stardom . Gerhard Kempinski ( looking amazingly like Danny DeVito ) is annoying in a cliched ' funny ' foreigner role . Director-scenarist Rodney Ackland shows a sure hand with the script . Less happily , his directorial style is distinctive , but not in a favourable way . Ackland has a penchant for tight close-ups of unimportant objects , giving them more significance than they warrant in the script . This is especially blatant during a sequence in the Elstree canteen , when Fennis's mother ( Kathleen O'Regan ) suddenly encounters an actor wearing monster-movie makeup . We see a tight close-up of actress O'Regan screaming in terror . This would be appropriate in a horror movie or a suspense movie involving genuine menace , but in this context Ackland's penchant for close-ups puts far too much dramatic weight on what's clearly meant to be a comic-relief bit . There's one extremely impressive montage sequence in ' Thursday's Child ' , depicting Fennis's rise to stardom . ( Done much better than a similar sequence in ' What Price Hollywood . ' ) I suspect that this montage was shot by a second-unit director , not Ackland . BIG SPOILER NOW . The film's ending is unexpected but completely welcome . Fennis reads a biography of Marie Curie , and is inspired to give up her acting career to become a research chemist . Ironically , earlier in the film , a press agent tried to ginger-up Fennis's studio biography by stating that her father ( a lowly dispensing chemist ) is a research chemist ( a much more glamorous job ) . I'm impressed that ' Thursday's Child ' tells its young female viewers to aspire to become scientists rather than actresses . Modern audiences might have trouble following some of the wartime references in the dialogue , such as when Phoebe spends her ' coupons ' to buy a birthday gift for Fennis . Still , this is an absolutely delightful film , starring a talented actress on the brink of womanhood . I'll rate ' Thursday's Child ' .
418308	1609079	377091	9.0	Excellent teen character study	One of the greatest movies ever made is ' A Place in the Sun ' . Based on a true murder case , this story features a protagonist who takes his pregnant ex-girlfriend on a boating trip with the intention of drowning her so he won't have to marry her . At the last moment , he has a pang of conscience ( or did he just lose his nerve ? ) and he confesses his intentions to her . . . but then the boat capsizes by accident , and she drowns anyway . The film refuses to let the protagonist off the hook , asserting that - - if he felt relieved by her death - - then he is morally guilty of murdering her . SPOILERS COMING . ' Mean Creek ' raises similar moral questions , in a plot line that evokes not only ' A Place in the Sun ' , but also ' River's Edge ' , ' Stand by Me ' and ' Deliverance ' , the latter film even quoted in the dialogue . Four adolescent boys lure teenage George on a boating trip , intending to play a cruel prank on him . A girl comes along too , unaware of their intentions . When she learns what's planned , she persuades the conspirators to call off their plot . But then tragedy intervenes , and George drowns . How culpable are the boys ? They literally dig themselves into a deeper hole by burying George's corpse , hoping to conceal the tragedy . ' Mean Creek ' features some of the most realistic adolescent dialogue I've ever heard . The boys bait each other with insults that are misogynist and homophobic . ( One boy , Clyde , has two gay fathers . ) Although the dialogue pulls no punches , the camera set-ups pull several . At one point , a boy urinates into the river : we see the stream of urine but the boy is out of frame . The most aggressive of the boys , Marty , makes several boasts about his genital endowment . Eventually , he is goaded into dropping his shorts and showing his stuff : the camera shoots this scene from behind , so we never find out what the fuss is about . Director / screenwriter Jacob Aaron Estes shows a great deal of talent , but makes a few strange decisions . At several points , the camera shows us printed words on a sign or a bumper sticker . . . but then the camera pulls away , or the object recedes from the camera , before we can read what's written . The script is nearly as good as the dialogue , with splendid exposition and only a few pacing problems . MORE SPOILERS . Very early in the film , we learn that Marty owns a handgun . Chekhov's rules of drama stipulate that if a gun shows up in the story , it must eventually be fired . The payoff for this weapon shows up very late in the film , in an unexpected way ( and the gun is never fired ) . In this case , it would have been better if the gun had never been mentioned nor shown until Marty decided to use it . Throughout this film there is a running directorial conceit , with sequences shown from the P . O . V . of George's video camera , but there turns out to be a valid payoff for this . Every performance in this movie is splendid . I was especially impressed with Rory Culkin ( Macaulay's more talented brother ) , Carly Schroeder as the well-intentioned girl , and Josh Peck as fat unpopular George , who clearly wants to be popular yet can't help being unpleasant . I'll rate ' Mean Creek ' , and I look forward to more films from Jacob Aaron Estes .
419516	1609079	19253	9.0	Chicken delight	" Pass the Gravy " is one of Max Davidson's funniest comedies , with less emphasis on the Jewish stereotypes which render so many of Davidson's films taboo today . The credits list Fred Guiol as director , and Leo McCarey merely as ' supervising director ' ( who he ? ) . . . but McCarey's distinctive brand of humour is evident throughout , so I suspect that he deserves much of the credit for the direction . . . whilst Guiol ( an experienced gagman ) deserves credit for the story . George Stevens , later a great director , does first-rate camerawork here . There's one surprising sexual gag in this movie that would probably go right over the heads of most modern viewers . Max's neighbour Schultz ( Bert Sprotte ) raises chickens , and the roost is ruled by his prize cock named Brigham , who has his pick of all the hens . In 1928 , audiences recognised this as a clear reference to Brigham Young , the polygamous Mormon leader who had wives in double figures . Max's daughter ( Martha Sleeper ) is engaged to Schultz's son ( Gene Morgan ) . To celebrate their engagement , Max gives his own son Ignatz ( Spec O'Donnell ) $2 to buy a roasting chicken . ( In 1928 , that was a fair price . ) Ignatz pockets the $2 and snatches one of Schultz's chickens instead , not realising he's taken Brigham the prize rooster . A stereotypical black-mammy cook ( smacking her lips ) roasts the rooster , which turns out to have a surprisingly generous amount of meat on its bones . . . more as if it were a capon , rather than a rooster . Schultz is the guest of honour , so Max carves the chicken and generously gives Schultz a drumstick . But then Ignatz notices the ' First Prize ' metal band on the ankle of the drumstick that Schultz is eating . O'Donnell does some clever pantomime ( worthy of Keaton ) as he signals his sister , draws her attention to the tag , and tries to recruit her into his efforts to get the drumstick away from Schultz . Martha uses signals to notify George , and the three of them try to notify Max . . . who of course is utterly oblivious to their efforts . There's some hilarious pantomime here . Martha Sleeper ( nice looks , unpleasant name ) was one of those rare actresses who could do slapstick without becoming vulgar or undignified . At one point , trying to tip the wink to Max , she pantomimes a hen while Gene Morgan pantomimes a rooster . Nearby is an ivory sphere of no obvious purpose : it looks vaguely like a billiard ball , except it's too large . Without her knowledge , this egg-like object conveniently ends up under Martha's rump while she's doing her hen imitation . When she finishes playing hen and discovers that she has laid an ' egg ' , the look on Martha Sleeper's face is hilarious . Gene Morgan is good too . . . why didn't his career take off ? In time-honoured Hal Roach fashion , the last shot of the film ends up with a desperate figure fleeing into the distance in long shot . ' Pass the Gravy ' is hilarious . I'll rate it , and I might have rated it a perfect 10 if they'd left out that Aunt Jemima cook .
419697	1609079	126880	10.0	Rapture and rupture .	Winsor McCay was a newspaper cartoonist in the glorious days when cartoonists were given an entire over-sized Sunday newspaper page on which to give their artwork free rein . An absolute master of perspective , McCay was best at dream-like and nightmarish scenarios , which explains why his two most successful projects were ' Little Nemo in Slumberland ' ( dreams ) and ' Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend ' ( nightmares ) . This is a good place to explain the origin of that weird word ' rarebit ' . A dish of toasted cheese and bread , with seasoning , is known in Britain as ' Welsh rabbit ' . This was meant as an English joke : supposedly , the Welsh are so incompetent that toasted cheese is the nearest they can come to cooking a game dish ( rabbit ) . In American restaurants , Welsh rabbit was often the least expensive dish on the menu ( because of its cheap ingredients ) but uninformed customers would often mistakenly assume that Welsh ' rabbit ' must be a meat dish , significantly cheaper than the other meat dishes on the bill of fare . To avoid this misunderstanding , some American host changed the spelling to ' rarebit ' , and it caught on . In McCay's comic strip ' Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend ' , a man or woman would go to bed after a dinner of Welsh rarebit , and would experience a bizarre nightmare . This popular newspaper strip fostered at least one live-action silent film ( by Edwin S Porter ) , and several animations by McCay himself . ' The Flying House ' ( an instalment in McCay's ' Rarebit ' series ) is the most lyrical of his cartoons , and only slightly nightmarish . A woman joins her husband Bert in bed after eating a rarebit . But she awakens to discover that Bert has gone up to the attic to tinker with some odd machinery . It develops that Bert has changed the house into an aeroplane , which he takes into the stratosphere , and then to outer space . SPOILERS COMING . McCay's visuals are impressive , the more so since he drew them all himself without the help of ' in-betweeners ' . During the outer-space climax , I was intrigued that he drew Earth from an oblique angle . . . rather than the usual cliché of putting it ' right-side up ' with the Antarctic lowermost . The flight of the house is lyrical , rapturous , and - - unlike McCay's other ' Rarebit ' adventures - - not remotely nightmarish . . . until the very ending , when the house explodes and the husband and wife plummet to Earth . I'll rate this delightful cartoon a full : it isn't very funny , but McCay is striving here for thrills and visual splendour rather than laughs . Sadly , almost none of McCay's original artwork survives . In 1982 , I interviewed American comic-book artist Leonard B Cole , who worked alongside artist Robert McCay ( Winsor's son ) in the 1940s . Cole told me that McCay once brought a large quantity of his father's artwork to the studio where they worked , and offered to give it away to any artist who would take it . There were no takers , so McCay simply threw out the lot ! Today , those illustration boards would be priceless . ( Long before I met him , Cole regretted his decision to pass up the offer . ) Now , if I only knew the precise date when Robert McCay threw away those art boards , I could power up the time machine and . . .
418555	1609079	130802	10.0	Kosher courtroom capers	The hilarious silent-film comedy ' Jewish Prudence ' is fairly easy to obtain in film libraries , but all known English-language prints of this movie have the original title card ' Jewish Prudence ' removed and a new title card spliced in , so that this film is now renamed ' Prudence ' . If you can't locate this very funny movie under its original title , try looking for it under the less offensive ( and less funny ) name ' Prudence ' . The title ' Jewish Prudence ' is of course a pun on ' jurisprudence ' , but it also refers to the character played by silent-movie comedian Max Davidson in his starring films . Davidson , who was indeed Jewish ( and with strongly Semitic features ) , tended to play a stereotypical Jewish character on-screen . This can be unpleasant for modern viewers , but Davidson usually steered clear of the more vicious aspects of a Jewish caricature . His on-screen character tended to be resourceful rather than cunning , frugal rather than an outright money-grubber . Max Davidson reminds me of the English actor Ron Moody , whom he physically resembles : Moody has proudly used his Jewish heritage as a basis for most of his acting roles , yet his portrayals never become offensive . In ' Jewish Prudence ' , written by Stan Laurel and directed by Leo McCarey , Max is a father saddled with three grown children who will never amount to anything . His daughter ( Martha Sleeper ) is bone-idle . Max's older son ( Jesse De Vorska ) is an incompetent schlemiehl whom Max pressures into taking a job as a lorry driver . The younger son ( Johnny Fox ) is an idiot who wants to be a professional Charleston dancer . ( Fair enough : that's how Lord Grade got started . ) A handsome young lawyer ( Gaston Glass ) , newly admitted to the bar , wants to marry Max's daughter , but Max refuses to consent until lawyer Gaston wins his first court case . When Max and his dancing son witness a road accident , Max sees a chance to make some money by persuading Johnny to fake a leg injury . There's an uproariously funny sequence in which Johnny feigns injuries by displaying a false leg while concealing his real leg inside a hollowed-out cushion . Of course , several things go wrong . ( At one point , Johnny's got three legs showing . ) When Max gets a visit from two men who seem to be insurance claims adjusters , Johnny plays his scam for all it's worth . This scene has a very funny payoff . Johnny Fox , who gave an amazing performance as the supernatural visitor in ' One Glorious Day ' , gives a splendidly physical performance here as Max's son . Eugene Palllette , hefting only a fraction of his later girth , is impressive as one of the visitors . Spec O'Donnell , who played Davidson's son in so many of his films , is absent from these proceedings . SPOILERS COMING . Meanwhile , Max brings suit against the driver who supposedly injured Johnny . The lawyer for the defence is none other than Gaston , who humiliates Max and Johnny in court by exposing them ( hilariously ) as liars and frauds . Gaston wins his case and then smoothly claims the right to marry Max's daughter . Max drives away in disgust , but his car is immediately hit by a truck . Gaston eagerly offers to represent Max in a lawsuit against the truckdriver , but the driver turns out to be ( of course ) Max's other son ! ' Jewish Prudence ' is extremely funny ; even more so because ( unlike many other Hal Roach comedies of this period ) it actually has a believable plot . Director Leo McCarey's comic pacing is brisk and excellent . The climactic trial scene in this film must have been good experience for McCarey when he directed Chico Marx's trial in ' Duck Soup ' . However , I was annoyed by one ' impossible ' gag in ' Jewish Prudence ' during the courtroom sequence , when a solemn portrait of George Washington is seen to burst out laughing at Max's pathetic testimony . This sort of gag is acceptable for a totally unrealistic comedian such as Harpo Marx , but it drastically conflicts with the comedic style of Max Davidson , who tended to play very plausible and realistic characters . It's only due to fears of Political Incorrectness that Max Davidson's ( Jewish ) screen characterisation is so seldom available to modern filmgoers . I'll rate this very funny movie .
419617	1609079	260948	10.0	Brilliant , distinctive , utterly original !	Guy Maddin is the most brilliant film-maker working today ! If there's somebody better , that person must be labouring in obscurity . Maddin is strongly influenced by the disciplines of silent film , but his vision is unique , distinctive , and utterly original . ' The Heart of the World ' could easily have been a throwaway film , given the circumstance of its origin . The Toronto Film Festival commissioned Maddin to make a brief film to fill a gap in their programming schedule . A mere time-passer . What Maddin gave them was utterly unexpected . Maddin uses large-grain film stock and Klieg-style lighting techniques to replicate the look of silent film . Maddin's production design ( costumes , makeup , hairstyling ) impeccably recreates the images of that period . It's easy to believe that ' Heart of the World ' is actually compiled from old UFA out-takes , circa 1925 . Only just occasionally does Maddin's grasp on the 1920s show the joins , and then those lapses are probably intentional . ' The Hearts of the World ' depicts the rivalry of two brothers . Nikolai is an idealist engineer . Osip is playing Jesus Christ in a passion play , and seems to have developed a genuine messiah complex . Amusingly , Osip does his Jesus routine whilst toting a cross made from metal girders . . . an Art Deco crucifixion ! The brothers vie for the love of Anna , a beautiful scientist who has built a device which enables her to gaze into the Earth's core , literally the heart of the world . Meanwhile , a bloated plutocrat named Akmatov lusts for Anna . All of this is explained in silent-film titles , in a 1920s typeface that looks vaguely Cyrillic . The actors employ authentic silent-film acting techniques while resisting the temptation to ' guy ' those methods or exaggerate them . The only lapse occurs when Anna suddenly vibrates her eyes back and forth while attempting to choose between the two brothers . This seems to be Maddin's intentional parody of silent-film acting . For the rest of the film , his homage to the past is sincere . I spent a delightful six minutes trying to spot all the references and influences in this movie . Maddin is clearly influenced by ' Metropolis ' ( my favourite film ) , but I also spotted the influences of ' Aelita ' , ' Vampyr ' , ' Potemkin ' and ' Haxan ' in this frenzied melange . This is not to accuse Maddin of plagiarism . He displays his influences openly , using them as a foundation for a vision uniquely his own . It's refreshing to see a 21st-century filmmaker who acknowledges a debt to silent films , in an industry filled with Tarantino wanna-bes and counterfeit Hitchcocks . ' The Heart of the World ' is one of the most distinctive , exciting and exhilarating movies I have ever seen . No doubt of it : I rate this movie , and I look forward to more work by this filmmaker whose work is at once utterly alien yet enticingly accessible .
418302	1609079	138957	10.0	Brilliantly anarchic hilarity .	I was delighted to view this tele-recording for two reasons . Firstly , it's well and truly hilarious . Secondly , the recovery of this long-lost recording vindicates for television something I've long maintained for cinema films : no movie or TV programme should be considered ' lost ' unless it was deliberately destroyed . Sadly , the BBC are notorious for wiping their own programmes and taping over them . . . and so , far too many great moments of British television history are indeed gone forever . Unless the transmission patterns are still bouncing off Alpha Centauri . Another IMDb contributor , Elena-48 , has already reviewed this recording . Elena's review is perceptive but contains one niggling error : Alan Bennett's sermon is ostensibly about Esau and Jacob , not Ezra . Bennett's sermon is hilarious , as he piously and pretentiously draws metaphors between sardine tins and human existence . ( ' I wonder : is there a little bit you can't reach under the sardine tin of your life ? I know there is under mine . ' ) Here's something which this recording doesn't mention : an audiotape of Bennett's hilariously pretentious sermon is now used as a training tape in the Anglican church , warning newly ordained priests of the sort of claptrap they must avoid . The opening sketch , with its references to the Cold War and Harold Macmillan , is necessarily dated but still funny . . . especially when Peter Cook warns the gaunt Jonathan Miller to ' try to look well-fed ' . Elsewhere , we have Miller as a prisoner in a death cell : Cook bookends this routine , setting the scene and then returning for the punchline . Cook and Dudley Moore perform their brilliant ' One Leg Too Few ' sketch , with Moore as the one-legged ' unidexter ' auditioning for the role of Tarzan . Over the decades , Cook and Moore performed this routine hundreds of times , forcing Moore to spend many cumulative hours hopping on one foot . As Moore actually had a clubfoot ( only partially corrected ) , the effect on him was not pleasant . But the routine is uproarious . At intervals throughout , Moore performs his brilliant piano solos . The entire cast perform ' So That's the Way You Like It ' , skewering Shakespeare hilariously . Less effective is a routine in which all four portray camp homosexuals . A high point is Jonathan Miller's bizarre monologue , ' The Heat-Death of the Universe ' , pondering the fate of trousers that are abandoned on British Railway trains . My own favourite here - - a quietly hilarious set-piece - - is Cook's solo turn , as a demented monologist sitting on a bench , explaining why he could have been a judge but ended up being a coal miner . Although the character is never named here , Cook privately named this creation E . L . Wisty , and depicted him many times over the decades . Cook's E . L . Wisty routine changed significantly at each performance , as Cook introduced new improvisations . Periodically throughout this taped performance , the camera cuts away to show the audience . I felt this was a mistake , as the laughter on the soundtrack makes it clear that there's a live audience . Much more effective are the close-in shots , enabling us to see the expressions on the faces of the cast as the sadistic Cook ad-libs , trying to ' corpse ' his castmates ( especially Moore ) and make them break character as they burst out laughing . With Cuddly Dudley and ' Cookie ' now both dead , and Bennett and Miller having largely forsaken performance in favour of their other talents , it's a delight to be able to see this crucial record of these four comedic geniuses at their peak . And this show is pretty damned funny , too . I'll rate it absolutely .
418648	1609079	343407	10.0	Spoot is a hoot when his pillow goes toot !	' Barnaby Spoot and the Exploding Whoopee Cushion ' ( what a great title ! ) was transmitted 28 May 1965 on BBC1 . This one-off playlet is a perfect example of the sort of comedy that British television does so brilliantly , but which American TV doesn't even attempt to create . A story like this would never get production approval from American TV executives unless it were a pilot for a continuing series . . . and the scriptwriters of ' Barnaby Spoot ' would have had difficulty spinning this idea into a continuing series , as it's about a man who attempts to murder his boss . ' Barnaby Spoot ' was written by the veteran comedy team of Barry Took and Marty Feldman . This was during the period before Feldman became a successful on screen performer . ( BBC producers were reluctant to put Feldman in front of a TV camera , due to his bizarre appearance . ) In hindsight , the role of Barnaby Spoot seems tailored for Feldman's distinctive persona . . . but the role was actually played by John Bird , a popular comedic actor ( as opposed to a comedian ) who played a wide range of roles in British television comedy during this period . The entire cast are first-rate , and well served by producer Dick Clement ( a brilliant comedy scripter in his own right ) who also served as uncredited director of this playlet . SYNOPSIS : Barnaby Spoot ( John Bird ) is the lowly assistant in a novelty shop managed by short-tempered Mr Bostock ( John Le Mesurier , another comedy veteran ) . Spoot is a mere shopclerk . . . but he keeps trying to make his mark in the novelties trade ( and augment his income ) by inventing new gags and novelties , in the hope that Bostock will add them to the shop's stock-in-trade . Unfortunately , all of Spoot's novelty inventions are terrible . His latest failure is the " chatty Cheddar " . . . a talking cheese that nobody would possibly want . Dismayed by Bostock's rejection of his cheesy brainchild , Spoot decides to wreak revenge by assassinating the entire board of directors of the conglomerate that owns the novelty shop . How does he plan to do this foul deed ? By smuggling into the boardroom an exploding whoopee cushion ! Of course , Spoot's grim plot takes an unexpected turn . . . Also prominent in the cast are Ronald Lacey as Justin Fribble , and ( short of height but long on talent ) the deft South African comedienne Sheila Steafel as Narcissus Font . ( Great name , that ! ) Trust Feldman and Took to get great comedy out of the theme of a downtrodden little man who turns homidical . John Bird turns in a fine performance as Spoot , but I regret that Feldman didn't play this role himself . Still , I rate this hilarious show . Well done all round !
418817	1609079	302584	10.0	WARNING : Very catchy song !	The American animator Gene Deitch really deserves to be better known : his toons are funny and accessible , with a physical appearance and character movements that are uniquely Deitch's work . His cartoons don't remind me of anyone else's . Due to the labour-intensive cost of cel animation , much of Deitch's work has been done in eastern Europe , where non-union animators could do the tedious in-between work more cheaply than it would have been done Stateside . Regrettably , this cheapness sometimes brings an overall shoddiness to Deitch's toons . ' The Frozen Logger ' is a delight . There's no dialogue ; we hear folksinger Lee Hayes singing a tune in time that narrates the action . This song's waltz-time melody is extremely catchy , and the simple lyric is quite funny . WARNING : After you view this cartoon , the song will be stuck in your head for days afterward . Basically , this is the story of a hardy lumberjack up in the Klondike , who's minding his business one day in the local saloon and stirring his coffee with his thumb ( don't ask ) when an attractive woman comes up to him , relating her tale of woe . ( Male singer Hayes incorporates the woman's narration into his lyric . ) As in all of Deitch's best work , the character animation is a delight . Much of the action takes place outdoors during a snowfall , and the snow is well-animated . Throughout the toon , there are two macho guys slugging it out in the street like a couple of rejects from Rex Beach's ' The Spoilers ' . It's amusing how their punches rock each other : one guy oscillates vertically , the other horizontally . The main character of the logger is animated differently from these two lumber-jerks , so when all three of them appear in the same set-up it looks very funny . And the payoff to the story is good , too . I'll rate this toon . Now , if I could just get that song out of my head . . .
418850	1609079	90476	10.0	Brilliant show-business epic	The mini-series ' Lost Empires ' is a brilliant adaptation of J . B . Priestley's novel , extremely faithful to the original text ( even using much of Priestley's dialogue ) yet opening up the material to heighten the contrast between the false world of the British music-hall ( where this story's leading characters spend much of their time ) and the grim reality of life in working-class England in the months leading into the Great War . The opening scene of the first episode sets up the mood perfectly , with a chorus girl in military drag as Tommy Atkins , singing the recruitment song ' We Don't Want to Lose You , But We Think You Ought to Go ' . The title of ' Lost Empires ' is a pun . Explicitly , it refers to the fact that the events of the First World War triggered the deterioration of the British Empire and the decline of Britain's clout as a global power . More subtly , the title refers to the fact that the leading chain of variety theatres in Britain's major cities during the early twentieth century were known as the Empires ( the Bristol Empire , the Glasgow Empire , and so forth ) . Even more subtly , the decline of Britain's variety halls ( paralleling the death of vaudeville in America ) happened at roughly the same time as the decline of Britain as a world power . There are many levels of meaning in Priestley's novel , and this mini-series cleverly depicts them all . Colin Firth is splendid as the callow young Richard Herncastle . It's 1913 : Herncastle has left school and is now seeking a career . Unexpectedly , he gets a job offer from his uncle Nick ( played by the brilliant John Castle ) . Nick is a stage magician who tours the variety halls with an elaborate stage act involving all manner of trick apparatus and stage effects . Nick offers Richard a job , in charge of maintaining the act's equipment and arranging its transport from one theatre to the next . Also , Richard will appear onstage as Richard's assistant , wearing an elaborate Arabian Nights costume and riding a bicycle during a vanishing-trick . As the plot progresses into the events of 1914 , Britain is plunged headlong into the war . . . and Richard must contemplate a vanishing-trick of another sort . Laurence Olivier is prominently featured in ( only ) the first episode of this series as Harry Burrard , a comedian who isn't funny . . . and whose deathly-bad performances are harming the success of every other act on the bill . This series depicts the routine of variety-hall performers with keen accuracy . Because Nick and Richard are on the same bill as Harry , they more or less have to live with him round the clock : he travels with them aboard the same trains from one engagement to the next , and stays in the same theatrical hotels with them . Olivier gives a stand-out performance , as Burrard gradually reveals his paranoia and his increasing mental disturbances . I recall that when ' Lost Empires ' first premiered on television in Britain , several critics made glib comparisons between Olivier's role here and his performance as Archie Rice , the untalented pierside comedian in ' The Entertainer ' . These are two entirely different roles , and Olivier gives one of his finest performances in ' Lost Empires ' . My only complaint about this excellent mini-series is that Olivier's abrupt departure in the first episode skews the dramatic emphasis towards the beginning of this series rather than its final episode . ' Lost Empires ' is a triumph : well-written , well-directed , brilliantly paced and well-acted all round . No question : I rate this series .
