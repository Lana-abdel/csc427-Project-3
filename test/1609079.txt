418399	1609079	281631	1.0	No Balls , no Bluff : this film is lost .	" Balls Bluff " is a low-budget , amateur short film that merits a small footnote in film history as the first movie written and directed by Robert Downey , Senior . No prints of this movie are known to exist . I have often maintained that no movie should be considered ' lost ' unless it was deliberately destroyed . Many , many films that were officially ' lost forever ' have been rediscovered by diligent searchers . In fact , just last week ( as I write this ) , BBC World Service announced the discovery of a complete print of ' Beyond the Rocks ' , a silent film directed by the very underrated Sam Wood ( apparently not one of his best efforts , but any Sam Wood movie is worthy of attention ) . So , ' Balls Bluff ' may yet turn up . But this seems unlikely . When a lost film is rediscovered , it's usually because at least one release print was never returned to the distributor , and the errant print is found in a private collection or archive . ' Balls Bluff ' was never released or distributed in the first place , so it's highly unlikely that a print will turn up in a forgotten projection booth . I have not seen ' Balls Bluff ' , which probably no longer exists . My review of this film is based on information given to me by two friends of mine : Fred von Bernewitz ( who edited ' Balls Bluff ' but no longer owns a print ) and the late Art d'Lugoff , an impresario who once screened ' Balls Bluff ' in his jazz club in Greenwich Village , NYC . Fred von Bernewitz originally distinguished himself in the 1950s as the compiler of a checklist of art and articles in ' Mad ' magazine . At the time that I write this , Fred von Bernewitz now has a very respectable career as an audio editor . ' Balls Bluff ' is unofficially based on ' An End to Bugling ' , a novel by Edmund G Love , who is better known for writing the book that became the Broadway musical ' Subways Are for Sleeping ' . EG Love was a journalist who , as a publicity stunt , once ate his way through 5 , 000 New York City restaurants . . . in alphabetical order of the restaurants ' names ! ' An End to Bugling ' is his novel about a Confederate Army regiment at the battle of Gettysburg in 1863 who , due to a glitch in Heaven , are sent forward in time to Gettysburg , PA exactly one century later . ( This novel was still being written by EG Love at the time when Downey borrowed its premise for ' Balls Bluff ' . ) ' Balls Bluff ' is the story of one Union Army soldier ( played by director / scripter Downey ) who abruptly finds himself snatched from a Civil War battlefield in 1861 and catapulted 100 years into the future , to Central Park in New York City . Of course , he sees cars and other strange objects . He sees a newspaper headline about Vice President Johnson and he assumes this refers to Andrew Johnson , not Lyndon . He tells a modern onlooker that he's " a Union man " , and of course this is misinterpreted as a reference to trade unions . Eventually , the soldier learns that the Yankees ( baseball team ) are in the Bronx today , so he heads north ( geddit ? ) to rejoin his regiment . Get it ? Yankees ? Union Army ? Civil War ? Bring the jubilee . . . As ' Balls Bluff ' was a very short film , made on a negligible budget , it was probably intended as Downey's ' demo ' film to get him professional assignments . . . and on that level , it certainly succeeded , as Downey went on to a very notable career . By all accounts , ' Balls Bluff ' wasn't very clever or funny , but ( with its short running time and shorter budget ) it didn't really have a chance to do those things . As I've not actually seen ' Bulls Bluff ' , I shan't rate it .
418938	1609079	15087	1.0	After you , Alphonse . . .	' Love and Glory ' was directed by Rupert Julian , whose best-known credit is the silent version of ' The Phantom of the Opera ' , starring Lon Chaney . But Chaney and Julian quarrelled very bitterly during production of that film : Julian was ultimately dismissed from the set , and Chaney took over the direction himself . . . with an uncredited assist by Edward Sedgewick . Rupert Julian's reputation is based entirely on one highly regarded film ( ' Phantom of the Opera ' ) which he largely didn't direct . ' Love and Glory ' is probably a better indication of his talents . This movie is very bad indeed . This is one of those films that take place in two time periods several decades apart . In the 1860s , a regiment of Zouaves ( French infantry ) are fighting in Algeria . For some stupid reason , Anatole Picard has brought along his wife Gabrielle , played by Madge Bellamy with an elaborate marcel hairdo that immediately types her as a 1920s actress . When gabby Gabbie ( she gets plenty of dialogue in the intertitles ) wanders off and gets captured by the riffraff Riffs , Anatole and his buddy Pierre leave their regiment and go looking for her . They find Gabrielle in the encampment of local warlord Karim Bey , but now they get captured too . ( C'est le guerre , oui ? ) Discovering that Anatole is the regiment's trumpeter , the Bey ( a stereotypically stupid swarthy foreigner ) orders him to bring forth his trumpet and blow the call for retreat so that his regiment will go home . Of course , Anatole blows a charge instead . ( This is clumsily depicted in the silent-film intertitles . ) When Anatole gives his horn a sweet toot , the Zouave regiment come rushing into view , toot sweet . Sacre bleu ! Gabrielle and lucky Pierre are rescued , but Anatole dies in action . Vive le France ! Fade in fifty years onward , during the days of the Great War . Pierre and Gabrielle ( now much older ) are living in the French village of Mirabel , which is lately overrun with German schweinhunds , I mean soldiers . From this point , the movie degenerates into a sluggish examination of honour , courage , truth and beauty . Madge Bellamy looks utterly ludicrous in old-age makeup , and Charles de Roche ( as Pierre ) looks very nearly as bad . Ford Sterling ( the silent film era's equivalent of Harvey Korman ) overacts outrageously as the French mayor who must appease the German invaders . Gibson Gowland is much more impressive in a too-small role . Rupert Julian shows here how bad a director he was . There are long , long , long stretches in which a single actor ( usually Madge Bellamy ) is kept in close-up , relieved only by long speechy intertitles . Julian should have learnt from the example of William Wellman , who always used close-ups only very sparingly for maximum emotional impact . Also , Julian should have studied Wellman's action sequences : in ' Love and Glory ' , the battle scenes in 19th-century Algeria are ludicrously bad , and the modern-day battle sequence ( German shock troops versus French poilus ) is utterly unconvincing . I'll rate ' Love and Glory ' precisely .
418706	1609079	180165	1.0	Skip the movie , watch the saddle .	Spade Cooley ( whose nickname referred to his protuberant lips ) had a semi-successful career as a singing cowboy , a sort of downmarket Roy Rogers performing on radio and television . ( He even got mentioned in an episode of Jackie Gleason's ' Honeymooners ' . ) Cooley's minimal talent soon lost momentum : by the early 1950s he was washed up on the air waves , and hoping to star in cowboy movies . He made three dire oaters and then called it a day . In 1961 , the hot-tempered Cooley beat and tortured his wife so severely that she died , and he was convicted of murdering her . As with Tom Neal ( another homicidal actor who wasn't much of an actor ) , a morbid fascination hangs over Cooley's films , purely due to the real-life tragedy . ' The Silver Bandit ' is the second ( and probably worst ) of his three starring vehicles . This is one of those cheapjack stories with a masked villain , a device which enables a stunt double to do all the fighting and riding without the audience catching wise that he's a double . Cooley portrays the meek clerk of the silver mine , whose mettle is tested when he must catch the bandit . That's a really bad decision , because Cooley is such an inept actor that it's a bad idea to have him playing a feckless character who calls attention to his own naffness . This entire movie appears to have been filmed on a budget of about two bits and a plugged nickel , except that the Silver Bandit owns a hand-tooled Bohlin saddle that had me green with envy . In fact , I kept watching the saddle leathers instead of this movie , because the saddle was a lot more interesting . The songs in this semi-musical western are ineptly performed by Cooley and Ginny Jackson . And this movie features the only silver mine I've ever seen that's located BELOW the timber line ; in real life , silver ore is usually found above high timber . Sadly , ' The Silver Bandit ' is so bad , it doesn't even manage to be enjoyable on a campy level . I'll rate this movie precisely one point , for that Bohlin .
419725	1609079	431591	1.0	Foul ball !	' Abner the Baseball ' is an extremely low-budget cartoon from Paramount , the studio that consistently produced the least entertaining and least imaginative animation . The opening credits of this cartoon ( with a choral theme song ) place so much emphasis on the title character , they make this toon seem intended as the debut of an ongoing series . But this is strictly a one-off , and it's hard to see how it could have been otherwise : Abner is just a talking baseball . . . and he isn't even a talker , so much as a mere narrator . We meet Abner propped upon a pillow in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York . With an annoyingly twee voice emerging from his anthropomorphised face , Abner reveals the events leading up to his arrival in this hallowed hall . It seems that Abner is the baseball that got whacked by Mickey Mantle for a home run against the Detroit Tigers , on 10 September 1960 . . . sailing for an astonishing 634 feet ( 193 metres ) . Abner gets whacked right out of Briggs Stadium and into the street , where he's found by a kid who is honest enough to bring him back to the stadium . Abner's narration tells us that this is the longest home run ever hit . Actually , Mantle had previously hit at least one longer home run , in an exhibition game . We see a cartoon version of Mickey Mantle , although the only part of him that's recognisable is the number 7 on his jersey . The animation here is quite bad even by Paramount's low standard , and repetitive with it . Every single time the catcher signals a pitch , he always gives the two-finger signal . ( My cultural references are British , so I got a big laugh out of this . . . for the wrong reason . ) Each time the pitcher goes into his wind-up , he invariably cocks his leg absolutely straight up into the air . Even a very unsophisticated child who knows nothing about animation cels will notice that the animators are using the same actions over and over in this brief toon . A baseball is not the best possible object for animators to imbue with anthropomorphic existence . Abner is drawn to look like a regulation baseball , but with a human-ish face . ( As if the baseball-headed mascot of the New York Mets got his body chopped off . ) Kids who watch this cartoon might be prompted to wonder how a humanised baseball feels when it gets knocked for a home run , or when it lands in the street outside the stadium . Doesn't this hurt ? Abner never addresses this . Nor are we ever told why this particular baseball is named Abner . The obvious assumption is that this refers to Abner Doubleday . It's now thoroughly discredited that Abner Doubleday invented baseball : this canard was created by an Anglophobe sport-equipment manufacturer who wanted to suppress the fact that America's national pastime was invented in England . Still , the disproven myth refuses to die . When I visited Arlington National Cemetery - - where Doubleday is buried - - I was annoyed that the tour guide kept saying that Doubleday invented baseball ( which he didn't do ) , while mentioning nothing at all about Doubleday's actual achievements as a general in America's Civil War . I'll rate ' Abner the Baseball ' just 1 point in 10 , and that's only because I'm a baseball fan .
418440	1609079	8372	1.0	Lost but no loss , Stan Laurel's bicorn-y debut .	Some footage from ' Nuts in May ' ( 1917 ) - - Stan Laurel's very first movie - - was salvaged five years on and edited into ' Mixed Nuts ' , another of Laurel's pre-Hardy comedies ( from a different production company ) , but ' Nuts in May ' in its original form almost certainly no longer survives . The obscure production company that made ' Mixed Nuts ' obtained clear title to ' Nuts in May ' ( from an even more obscure production company ) , and had no interest in letting any prints of the previous movie compete with their revised version . ' Nuts in May ' was a right one-off : the one and only film ever made by the Bernstein Studio , an independent endeavour which produced and released just this lone one-reeler before going out of business . Sam Bischoff - - the producer of ' Mixed Nuts ' , and a notorious tightwad - - bought ' Nuts in May ' at a bailiff's auction . In the last years of his life , I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock , a Hollywood old-timer who knew Stan Laurel intimately . ( Besides working with Stan Laurel , Rock introduced him to Lois Neilson , and Rock was subsequently best man at their wedding . ) Although Joe Rock didn't work on ' Nuts in May ' , he remembered the film and told me quite a bit about it . This synopsis of ' Nuts in May ' is based on Joe Rock's memories ( still clear as he approached his ninetieth birthday ) and my viewing of ' Mixed Nuts ' . Stan plays a resident of a " Home for the Weak-Minded " , apparently a lunatic asylum . There are several gags depicting the inmates ' bizarre behaviour . Stan's particular delusion is that he thinks he's Napoleon . ( Is there even one genuine case on record of anyone - - besides Bonaparte himself - - actually believing that he or she was Napoleon ? ) Stan walks the grounds of the cuckoo-hatch sticking his right hand into his shirt ( ha ha ) and wearing a Napoleonic hat . ( Memo to IMDb reviewer Bob Lipton : Napoleon's hat was a bicorn , not a tricorn . And how does Mr Lipton know that Stan is wearing a ' blue ' blazer in this monochrome movie ? ) Stan salutes everybody , including the other lunatics . He thinks he's Napoleon , but he gives the salute of the British army . Stan has his own personal keeper in the asylum : a taller moustached man who wears a kepi so that Stan will think he's a French officer . French soldiers ( and gendarmes ) didn't wear kepis until after Napoleon's death . . . but don't mind me ; I just work here . Stan gets out and finds some local boys , who eagerly join him in playing soldier . Stan's kepi-wearing keeper pursues him through the film , but at a lethargic pace . Stan hijacks a steamroller ( when did Napoleon ever drive a steamroller ? ) , and there's some unfunny undercranking as Stan nearly runs down some navvies in a road crew . In the surviving footage , the photography's bad and the pacing is awful . Stan Laurel's performance gives no hint of the brilliance to come . Indeed , right up until his team-up with Oliver Hardy ( apparently Hal Roach's idea ) , Laurel on the screen was just one more frenetic comedian , not necessarily imitating Chaplin but working the same trough of knockabout humour with little or nothing to distinguish him from other slapstickers . Joe Rock did tell me that ' Nuts in May ' was financed by Los Angeles impresario Adolph Ramish , who paid Stan Laurel the astounding wage of $75 to appear in it . Ramish screened ' Nuts in May ' at the L . A . Hippodrome , where it was seen by Carl Laemmle . . . not yet the major producer he would later become . Apparently Laemmle liked ' Nuts in May ' enough to sign Laurel to a contract with Nestor Film Company , one of the lesser satellites in the Universal Studios planetary system . However , from what I've seen of Stan Laurel's time at Universal , his work there was not especially funny . He really didn't come into his own until he arrived at Hal Roach's studio . . . where Laurel distinguished himself as a director and gag man as well as a comedian before teaming with Hardy . Purely for its historic value , it would be nice if a complete print of Stan Laurel's film debut eventually turns up in some forgotten bailiff's locker . However , the photography would be wretched even if the print were pristine . Stan Laurel was brilliant elsewhere , but not in the surviving footage of ' Nuts in May ' . And I'm positive that none of the ' lost ' scenes contain some nugget of hilarity : if something funny had been in there , Sam Bischoff would have included it in ' Mixed Nuts ' . I normally don't rate films I've never seen ( quiet in the back , there ! ) , but I feel confident that ' Nuts in May ' merits just 1 point in 10 , and an asterisk in film history for Stan Laurel paying his dues .
418858	1609079	14583	1.0	Her missionary position .	Robert Hichens was a prolific author who is now almost utterly forgotten except for his ghost story ' How Love Came to Professor Guildea ' , which is widely anthologised . The first time I read that story , it quite bored me . Years later , I read it again and was deeply horrified . ' The Voice from the Minaret ' is a film based on a Hichens novel which I haven't read . This film is a shallow and bathetic soap opera , which impressed me only for some elaborate ( but unconvincing ) sets . Maybe if I wait a few years and see this movie again , it will impress me . . . as Hichens's ghost story did , the second time round . Somehow , I rather doubt it . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . Lady Adrienne Carlyle ( Norma Talmadge ) is the wife of the colonial governor of Bombay , played by Edwin Stevens in Snidely Whiplash mode . When Lady Carlyle learns that her husband is playing footsie with the Countess La Fontaine ( apparently Bombay is knee-deep in bluebloods ) , she hops the next steamship bound for Southampton , intending to get a divorce in England . Aboard ship , she meets handsome Andrew Fabian , and the two of them start knockin ' boots in Lady Carlyle's stateroom . Erm , but it turns out that Fabian is a missionary , bound for Port Said to convert the heathens . No problem : Lady Carlyle jumps ship with him , and the two of them carry on knockin ' boots in Damascus . Presumably in the missionary position . Out of the canebrakes comes a bishop who persuades the two sinners to repent . Lady Carlyle and Fabian , shamefaced , go their separate ways . Then Lord Carlyle conveniently pops his clogs . Happy endings all round , as Lady Carlyle and her preacher-man scurry to the nearest choir loft . . . where they can be married without the stigma of a divorce for Lady Carlyle . What a load of cobblers ! Some of the sets feature some impressive chinoiserie , but I never for an instant believed that these characters were in Bombay , Port Said , aboard an ocean liner , or in any place other than a Hollywood set . Talmadge overacts rather direly , and it's only because Edwin Stevens's histrionics are even worse that Talmadge is acceptable at all . The self-righteous and hypocritical ending doesn't help . I'll rate this movie one point in 10 , purely for the art direction and some decent photography .
418853	1609079	208654	1.0	Not a feature that's stirring . . .	UPDATE : Gentle readers , do not be fooled by the fact that this IMDb review has received so many negative ( un - " useful " votes ) . ALL of those votes were cast by the same person , a very sad individual with too much free time on his hands . . . who sends me emails at regular intervals , demanding that I change this review to make it more favourable . Now , here's my review : Oh , what a piece of crap is this . Why do American television companies see Christmas as an opportunity to produce so many crap-awful specials ? In Britain , Christmas is just an opportunity for the TV stations to show a James Bond movie . I ought to have been warned off watching " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " when I saw that it was produced by Rankin / Bass , a production company that has churned out far too much unwatchable rubbish . But I'm a great fan of Tammy Grimes and Joel Grey , and John McGiver is very high on my list of all-time favourite character actors , so I sought out this animated film when I saw that they were listed in the cast . This story is awful . It's intended for kids , but kids deserve something better than this . The animation is terrible : far below Rankin / Bass's usual wretched standard . Joel Grey and Tammy Grimes are wasted in badly-written roles . Tammy Grimes was a very sexy actress with a very distinctive voice ( and a cod accent ) , so it's disturbing to hear her voice issuing from the badly-animated mouth of a badly-drawn MALE character . Worst of all is the character written for poor John McGiver . He plays a blowhard mayor , and the scriptwriter has given McGiver a terrible gimmick which is difficult to perform and not funny at all . Every single time McGiver speaks , his character launches into a bombastic speech with lots of long complicated esoteric sesquipedalian words , but invariably he gives up the struggle halfway through the sentence , says ' Aw , heck ! ' and then uses plain speaking to say what he'd meant to say in the first place . I always considered McGiver a brilliant actor , but he can't transcend this terrible running gag which isn't funny . I give somebody some credit for casting George Gobel in the lead role of a mouse . Gobel was a very self-effacing actor who deserved to be better known , and who was ( elsewhere , not here ) extremely funny in a soft-spoken and low-key way . His established persona fits perfectly with the mouse character he plays here . Too bad it's so terribly written . This cartoon is ostensibly based on the famous poem " A Visit from St Nicholas " , known incorrectly as " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " and traditionally credited to Clement Moore . . . but the link is very tenuous indeed . ( The poem mentions a mouse , and this cartoon is full of talking mice . ) On top of everything else , we now have solid evidence that Clement Moore stole the credit for this poem , which was originally published anonymously . In the year 2001 , a letter surfaced which Moore wrote to the editors of the newspaper that originally published this poem , asking whether any of the editors knew the name of the poem's author . When they replied that they did not , Moore waited until the death of the poem's true author , and then he took credit . None of Clement Moore's own poems show even a glimmer of the talent present in " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " . . . by which I mean the poem , not this terrible animated cartoon . There is substantial forensic evidence that the true author of this beloved poem was Major Henry Livingston , Jnr , scion of a patriotic family that helped finance the American Revolution . Parents , let your kids do anything at all on Christmas rather than letting them watch this horrible cartoon . It will turn their brains into figgy pudding . I'll rate " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " zero points out of 10 . Bah , humbug !
418652	1609079	18481	1.0	X plus Q equals zero	The most interesting thing about ' The Thirteenth Juror ' is the middle initials of its two leading players , Francis X . Bushman and Anna Q . Nilsson . This is surely the only time in film history that an actor with the middle initial " X " was teamed with an actress with the middle initial " Q " . And I was thinking about this while I watched the movie , which should tell you how interesting this movie is . Bushman plays an attorney who is highly respected but is secretly a serial philanderer . He gets caught in the act when his latest paramour's husband ( George Siegmann ) comes home unexpectedly . Bushman kills him in self-defence . For wildly complicated and implausible reasons , he decides to make the killing appear to be a homicide , so as to protect Anna Q . Nilsson . Bushman nobly stands trial for murder , in the full knowledge that he could get off with a verdict of self-defence if he told the truth . Make sense to you ? Me neither . SPOILERS COMING , BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO SPOIL . Anna Q . Nilsson and Francis X . Bushman are meant to be lovers in this movie , but the combination of Q and X adds up to zero . At the end , Bushman is acquitted ( via an implausible gimmick ) and he stands there beaming with approval as Nilsson is reunited with her husband . . . played by Walter Pidgeon , in another of his long series of thankless roles . Pidgeon's character in this movie is named Marsden , which is also the name of the character he played 3 years later in a completely unrelated film , ' The Gorilla ' , which is a lot better than this movie . ' The Thirteenth Juror ' is a dark-purple mellerdrammer . Nobody in this movie behaves normally if they have a chance to clench their fists , dishevel their hair , quiver their brows . This movie was made by Universal Studios under the reign of Carl Laemmle , who was nicknamed ' Uncle ' because of his penchant for putting his relatives on the payroll . ( Ogden Nash famously wrote : ' Carl Laemmle had a very large faemmle ' . ) ' The Thirteenth Juror ' was directed by Edward Laemmle , one of Carl's numerous nephews , who showed absolutely no talent for filmmaking and whose career was entirely due to Universal's nepotism . ( On the other hand , another of Carl Laemmle's nephews was William Wyler , who became a very great director indeed . ) I'll rate ' The Thirteenth Juror ' . Next case !
419296	1609079	12172	1.0	nearly a nasty Occident .	Sessue Hayakawa had a respectable career in silent-era Hollywood as an actor in films produced by white men for white audiences . But , as a Japanese man contending with the racial prejudices of the time , Hayakawa nearly always played villains . . . usually wily Orientals who lusted after decent white women . Because Hayakawa was working in Hollywood with white actors , most of his silent films were slight variations on the same plot : Hayakawa as an outsider in the white man's world , caught in the clash of incompatible cultures . ' The First Born ' , intriguingly , takes place in China and all the characters are Chinese . Unfortunately , nearly all the actors in this film are Caucasians , and their makeup jobs as Orientals are . . . well , let's say that Lon Chaney's talents are sorely lacking hereabouts . You've never seen so many unconvincing eyebrows and dodgy eyelids in one place . Particularly disastrous is the make-up job on Clarence Wilson , an extremely prolific character actor whose distinctive bald head ( resembling a peeled garlic clove ) is instantly recognisable despite the Sellotape on his eyelids . Another actor ( a genuine Oriental , this one ) plays a character identified in the intertitles as ' Man Low Tek ' . . . which suggests some very unfortunate low-tech puns . The differences between the facial structures of the genuine Orientals and the fake Orientals in this cast are glaringly obvious . The plot ? Cue Mister Wu . A boy named Chan Toy is killed , and his mother Chan Lee is sold into slavery . A tong war breaks out , with a murder committed to avenge the death of Chan Toy , and then another murder committed ( in the opposite direction ) to avenge the revenge . You want an abacus to count the corpses . An Occidental onlooker might count it as a point in this film's favour that , for once , Hayakawa is able to star in a film with an Oriental setting . Hold the rice balls . Hayakawa was Japanese , and the characters in this film are Chinese . Those are two entirely different cultures , and the Japanese are not noted for their deep admiration of the Chinese . I've lived in Kowloon and visited mainland China , and I know a wee bit about the Chinese culture : I found the depictions in this movie inaccurate to the point of giving offence . This movie would have us believe that all Chinese are bloodthirsty buddhists , so deeply obsessed with tradition , saving face , and fealty to one's ancestors that they cannot act as self-willed individuals . As Hayakawa produced this film , he must ultimately take the blame for what a white screenwriter and director have perpetrated here . The fact that this film about Orientals was made by an Oriental does not change the fact that ' The First Born ' is deeply racist . I'll rate this movie precisely one point , for the expert camera work and for some ' Chinese ' sets that fail to convince me of their authenticity but which are impressive for sheer effort .
418893	1609079	10112	1.0	Not even ' sub ' standard	' False Faces ' ( there's no ' THE ' in the film's title ) is being marketed on video as a Lon Chaney movie . Buyer beware ! Chaney plays a small role , having far less screen time than Henry Walthall and Mary Anderson . That wouldn't be bad if this were a good film . ' False Faces ' LOOKS like a good film , possessing elaborately tinted colour sequences and some highly artistic intertitles , sometimes superimposed on live backgrounds . Many of these intertitles are so elaborate that they're difficult to read . ( But we can clearly read the name of producer Thomas Ince in SIX different places in the credits : Ince was notorious for this shenanigan . ) A far worse drawback is that this film has a plot which is both dull and extremely overwrought . ' False Faces ' exploits the events of the Great War , and the movie's sympathies are very clearly drawn . The war is characterised as ' the armies of civilization beating back the wolf-hordes of a blood-crazed king ' . Hmm , guess which side is which . All the Americans are extremely virtuous and resourceful , and there's no mention at all of the British ( whose B . E . F . Tommies had far higher casualties than America's doughboys , and who were in the war longer ) . All the Germans are sub-human ' Huns ' , as the intertitles cry them . Don't mistake me : I quite agree that the Allies were ( and still are ) the good guys , but I'm deeply annoyed at attempts to demonise villains like the Kaiser or Hitler or Osama bin Laden . It's a cheap easy tactic to depict such people as inhuman monsters , because we don't want to contemplate why human beings could be capable of such hideous acts . Henry Walthall , a very dull and stolid actor , plays American super-agent Michael Lanyard , alias the Lone Wolf . When I saw the name ' Lanyard ' , I got ready to make puns about Walthall's hero stringing us along , but this movie ain't worth the trouble . The plot is downright incoherent , and features one of the most blatant examples I've ever seen of a ' McGuffin ' : a cylinder , allegedly containing some sort of microform , that's constantly passed back and forth among the characters . Doesn't mean a bloody thing , but everybody wants it . By the way , although Hitchcock popularised the term ' McGuffin ' ( which he credited to Angus McPhail ) , he did not create the concept that it represents . Pearl White , the queen of silent serials , had a McGuffin in many of her films , but she called it a ' weenie ' . Sure does LOOK a good film , though . Near the very beginning , there's an impressive dissolve shot in which several of the male cast members ( including Chaney ) are shown as disembodied heads , who suddenly sprout false whiskers that look very realistic . But this is just a camera stunt that doesn't advance the story . Much more impressive is a later sequence in which a German submarine commander ( allegedly the man who sank the Lusitania ) is haunted by the ghosts of his victims . First , some tiny people materialise on his table . Next , he sees children's corpses floating outside his porthole . When a ghost materialises in front of the hatchway , he shoots it . . . and the ghost falls over . ( This must be the only ever film in which bullets stop a ghost . ) As in Rex Ingram's ' The Conquering Power ' ( which may have been influenced by this movie ) , it's clear that the ' ghosts ' are manifestations of the villain's guilt complex rather than actual supernatural spooks . This sequence in ' False Faces ' is excellent , but has a contrived payoff . All the scenes aboard the submarine feature spacious roomy sets , with high ceilings ( not overheads ) , and nothing belayed nor bolted down . And if you're aboard a submarine and you want to sink it , just open the convenient hatch in the floor . Deck ? No , this one is definitely a floor . The hatchways are regular doors , the overheads are regular ceilings . If the script didn't say this was a submarine , I'd think we were on a movie set . Somebody open the window . Lon Chaney is my favourite actor , but - - unlike many people I've met whose Chaneyphilia borders on fanaticism - - I'm capable of admitting that Chaney sometimes gave a bad performance . He gives an utterly lousy one here , but that's the fault of the script and direction . Cast as a German spymaster , Chaney isn't allowed to portray the role as a human being . The character is written as a one-dimensional Hun , so that's how Chaney plays it . This film was made shortly before Chaney's stardom , when he was a hard-working utility actor who grabbed every role he could get . The climax is so utterly bad that it's laughable , with Walthall slathering make-up on the semi-conscious Chaney . This scene puts Henry Walthall alongside Ford Sterling ( in ' He Who Gets Slapped ' , a much better movie ) as one of the few actors who had the great honour to apply make-up to Lon Chaney . Walthall and Chaney had a genuinely affecting rapport together on screen in ' The Road to Mandalay ' ( in which they played brothers ) , but not here . I realise that Chaneyphiles will want to see every Lon Chaney movie they can find ; fair enough , but make ' False Faces ' a very low priority on your list of the Thousand Faces of Lon Chaney . I'll rate this dull movie only one point in 10 , for that atmospheric ghost sequence .
418647	1609079	7202	1.0	Pastafazoola for Little Mary	SPOILERS SPOILERS'Poor Little Peppina ' is not one of Mary Pickford's better efforts , although it's a creditable attempt at a change of pace for Little Mary . There's a long prologue in which she doesn't appear at all , her screen character being only an infant . Peppina's father is a wealthy landowner who helps send a Mafiosa to gaol . Seeking revenge , the gangster escapes and abducts Peppina . When a man and a child are rumoured to be drowned , Peppina's father assumes that the dead child is his daughter and he makes no attempt to find her . He sounds a devoted dad , he does . . . Fade out , fade in years later , and now the girl Peppina is Mary in a long black wig . When she finds herself heading for a forced marriage , she escapes with the aid of a duchess who gives her enough money to reach America . Peppina is also given the address of the duchess's brother in New York City , who will help Peppina become an American citizen . For safety's sake , Peppina disguises herself as a boy ( like Shakespeare's Rosalind ) for the trip , in which she stows aboard an ocean liner with her paisan buddy Beppo . Instead of cutting off her long tresses , Peppina becomes a ' boy ' by tucking her hair under a cap . In New York , she easily finds work as a messenger ' boy ' . . . but she loses the address of her patroness's brother . SPOILERS COMING . This film's plot has many , many , MANY coincidences . In New York , Peppina meets . . . none other than the villain who snatched her in the first place . Seeking protection , she asks for help from a handsome district attorney , who turns out to be the duchess's brother . Mama mia ! I give Mary Pickford credit here for one of her rare attempts at playing a sexually mature woman , rather than the little girl-character who could always be relied upon to get the cash registers ringing in Mary's box office . Also , this is one of Mary's rare attempts at an ethnic role . Her boy disguise is almost convincing . . . though not quite as convincing as in ' Little Lord Fauntleroy ' , in which she played a biological male . Cesare Gravina is excellent in a supporting role . A fatal flaw is the casting of Mary's brother Jack as her peasant friend Beppo . Jack Pickford was an actor with decent looks but no talent , whose career was entirely due to his sister's stardom . In the scenes between Mary and Jack Pickford , their physical resemblance is quite obvious . . . which is unfortunate here , as their characters aren't meant to be siblings . And the plot of this movie is unbearable . I'll rate ' Peppina ' . Marron ' !
418516	1609079	32255	2.0	Sink this ' Bismarck ' !	The 1940 film ' Bismarck ' was one of the Staatsauftragsfilme : the ' state-produced films ' of the Third Reich which were clearly meant as Nazi propaganda . Rather than blatantly extolling Hitler , these films typically chose a powerful figure from German history and depicted him favourably , careful to stress similarities ( real or invented ) between this protagonist and Adolf Hitler , the founder of the Third Reich . In this particular film , the similarities are more obvious than elsewhere . . . as the protagonist of ' Bismarck ' is the diplomat who founded the Second Reich . ' Bismarck ' is a selective recounting of the life story of Otto von Bismarck , the prime minister of Prussia who achieved military victory over Austria , humiliated the French government , and proclaimed Kaiser Wilhelm the First as the Emperor of Germany . Early on in this long movie , we get a feeling of what we're in for as Bismarck addresses the Landtag . Speaking directly into the camera , actor Paul Hartmann ( as Bismarck ) tells us : " The great questions of the present will not be solved by speeches and parliaments , but by iron and blood . " He doesn't say " Sieg heil ! " , but you get the message , ja ? This film carefully sets up parallels between Bismarck and Hitler . As soon as Bismarck becomes prime minister , the next scene shows him building up the army that will create a German empire . ( Hitler did much the same as soon as he became chancellor . ) Figures in Bismarck's life are presented as equivalents of figures in Hitler's career . Although Bismarck installed Wilhelm as emperor , this movie shows Bismarck challenging the Kaiser's authority and urging him to form a military non-aggression pact with Russia to strengthen Prussia's eastern flank . Wilhelm is depicted as a man who has outlived his usefulness , who should step aside for a stronger and greater leader : in other words , he's the equivalent of Paul von Hindenburg , the president of the Weimar Republic who was displaced by the ambitious Hitler . The period detail in ' Bismarck ' is excellent , and the production values are impressive . . . but then , Germany's UFA film studio was able to use cheap labour in wartime . In the central role , Paul Hartmann gives a lacklustre performance . Not much better is Friedrich Kayssler as Kaiser Wilhelm . ( Kayßler was murdered for political reasons less than a week before Hitler committed suicide . ) In the role of the Empress , Lil Dagover is darkly beautiful . . . still looking remarkably like the pale heroine she depicted in ' The Cabinet of Dr Caligari ' and ' Destiny ' . Many of Nazi Germany's propaganda films had some genuine artistic merit and interesting scripts , notwithstanding their political agenda . But ' Bismarck ' is long on Nazi agitprop and short on redeeming features . The most interesting thing about this movie is its sequel : ' Bismarck ' was a huge hit at the Third Reich's box office , reaping a profit of nearly two million reichsmarks . The propaganda office straight away commissioned a sequel : ' Die Entlassung ' . This is a much better film than ' Bismarck ' , with the same director but with a much better actor taking over the role of Otto von Bismarck : the great Emil Jannings . I'll rate ' Bismarck ' .
419622	1609079	20781	2.0	' Common Clay ' is merely mud	' Common Clay ' is based on an old stage play , and it shows . The action is creaky and stagebound , and the highly contrived final revelation relies on an extremely heavy coincidence which comes with an even heavier moral . Ellen Neal ( Constance Bennett , the least attractive of the three Bennett sisters ) is established as a ' bad girl ' who is more sinned against than sinning . We first see her working in a speakeasy , yet it's clear that she has few options . When the speakeasy is raided and Ellen is hauled off to court , Judge Filson advises her to associate with a better class of people . As in ' An Inspector Calls ' , it turns out here that the ' better ' classes are morally no better than the common people , and in fact are even worse . ( This hasn't been my own experience , I hasten to add . ) Ellen gets a job as a maid in the respectable household of the Fullertons . All is well until their handsome son Hugh comes home from college . His eyes meet Ellen's , and we know what's going to happen . Ellen is honest enough to let Hugh know about her spotty past , but it's not her past that he's interested in . Pretty soon Ellen has a bun in the oven , courtesy of the college boy . A year later , when Ellen shows up with a baby which she claims is Hugh's love-child , Hugh's father suspects a shakedown . To protect his family , he orders his attorney Yates to ruin Ellen's reputation , such as it is . Yates , the lawyer , is played by veteran character actor Tully Marshall in a Smith Brothers beard , which makes him the only actor in this cast who has something to hide behind . SPOILER COMING RIGHT NOW . Enter the twist ending , upstage left , dragging its coincidences across the script . Tully Marshall was a brilliant actor , but here he's lumbered with tying up an implausible plotline . Are you ready ? Turns out that bad-girl Ellen is the daughter of respectable lawyer Yates ! When he was a young man , the same age as Hugh , he decided to sow his wild oats with a woman who loved him but whom he didn't choose to marry . When she gave birth to his daughter , she generously decided to raise the girl entirely by herself , instead of compelling Yates to marry her . . . so as not to stand in the way of Yates's promising career as a lawyer . Hoo boy to this , and the hoo-boy factor gets even worse because Ellen's martyr mother is played by Beryl Mercer , the single most annoying performer in the entire history of Hollywood . ( Film historian William K Everson agreed with me on this . ) Fortunately , Mercer's ' contribution ' to this particular movie is largely confined to one long scene . Elsewhere , Mercer has polluted dozens of good movies with her whines , her snivels , her tremblings , her whimpered begorrahs . The sure hand of director Victor Fleming guides this material about as ably as it can be done . ( Not much . ) I admire Constance Bennett for her work on behalf of the American military ( she is buried in Arlington National Cemetery ) , but her appeal as an actress has always eluded me . Her sisters Joan and Barbara were much sexier and more talented . ( Barbara Bennett was the mother of notorious chat-show host Morton Downey Jnr . ) ' Common Clay ' was a stage vehicle for Jane Cowl , an important stage actress of the early 20th century who made few films , and who is now forgotten . If this film had starred Cowl , it might at least have rated some historical significance as a record of her stage performance . Any movie that gives Tully Marshall a chance to shine is welcome , but he did much better work for Victor Fleming ( with much better material ) in ' Red Dust ' . Hale Hamilton is good in his brief role as the judge . Beryl Mercer needs her sinuses cleaned out . ( Among other things . ) I'll rate this bathetic sobfest just .
418650	1609079	16652	2.0	Shut your trapeze	" Bigger than Barnum's " is a hokey drama with a circus background . Like so many movies which use the circus as a setting , this one gives a highly inaccurate and unconvincing depiction of the culture of circus people . A travelling circus is a self-contained universe in microcosm , and filmmakers who have never lived among circus people will have difficulty depicting that universe properly . Robert Blandin is the youngest in a line of circus aerialists : his father and grandfather were high-wire walkers before him . ( The fictional name ' Blandin ' used here was probably inspired by Blondin , a real-life daredevil who once walked a tightrope over Niagara Falls . ) Robert's father Peter has been performing an act in which he carries a pretty girl on his back while walking the high-wire . When Peter falls ill , it's Robert's turn to perform the act . The girl in question is the beautiful young dark-haired Juanita . When circus owner Ranglin decides he can sell more tickets if the act is performed without a safety net , young Robert refuses to do it . . . and he's promptly ostracised as a coward by all the other circus folk . But the show must go on ( says whom ? ) . To protect the Blandin family's reputation , Peter performs the high-wire act with Juanita on his back , even though he hasn't recovered his health . Inevitably , Peter slips and falls off the high wire . Juanita manages to grab the wire and save herself , but Peter is permanently crippled . . . and the circus folk blame Robert's cowardice for Peter's injury . Juanita and Robert are estranged . SPOILERS COMING NOW . One dark night , a fire breaks out in the hotel where Juanita and Peter are staying . ( Since when do circus people have enough money to stay in hotels ? ) Juanita manages to save herself , but the crippled Peter is trapped in the burning hotel . He manages to drag himself upstairs to the roof . Conveniently , a telephone wire passes directly above the roof . Guess who redeems himself by walking across the telephone wire to rescue his father . Without a safety net ! This movie is completely unconvincing in its depiction of circus people . In real life , they don't take unnecessary risks , and don't ostracise other acts for refusing to take such risks . Ralph Lewis ( a tragically underrated actor ) gives an excellent performance in a badly-written role . Viola Dana ( who had a small amount of circus training in real life ) does surprisingly well in a predictable role . In the central role as Robert Blandin , George O'Hara is worthless . Ralph Ince , who directed the film , turns in a decent performance in a comedy-relief role . I'll rate this hokum .
418252	1609079	10157	2.0	' gay ' is hardly the word . . .	' The Gay Lord Quex ' ( stop laughing in the back , there ) is the sort of material that no longer appeals , as it's so deeply concerned with the class system . . . and with public perception being more important than justice . Sophie Fullgarney is a London manicurist whose young stepsister Muriel is engaged to the Marquis of Quex , a wealthy milord who has a reputation as a scoundrel . For Muriel , it's purely an arrangement of financial convenience . Sophie is engaged herself , to Sir Chichester Frayne the famous palmist . ( This character appears to be based on Cheiro , a palm-reader who was welcome in the highest levels of British society at the time that this film was produced . ) Without consulting Muriel , Sophie decides to save her stepsister by compromising Quex . When Quex accepts an invitation to spend the weekend at the country estate of the Duchess of Strood , Sophie insinuates herself into the household disguised as a chambermaid . All proceeds to plan , until Quex discovers an opportunity to compromise Sophie . Which one will tug the bell-cord first ? This story is dull and no longer relevant , if it ever was . The acting is stodgy and the directing is slow . There is no end of people going in and out of different doors , but none of it adds up to any amusement . Tom Moore is a bit too young and virile to be the gay Lord Quex . Arthur Housman , not yet typecast as a drunk , is impressive in a small role . I'll rate this movie .
419662	1609079	33975	2.0	Not so much a circus as a freak show .	Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane starred in a series of low-budget comedies that were extremely popular in 1940s Britain , in which Lucan ( in drag ) played an old Irish scrubwoman named Mrs Riley , and McShane ( Lucan's real-life wife ) played Old Mother Riley's daughter Kitty . Neither of these portrayals were very plausible : Lucan's ' Irish ' accent was just as obviously fake as his allegedly female gender . The running conceit of McShane's character is that Kitty is supposed to be extremely gorgeous . ( She was mildly pretty in the earlier films , but less so later . . . especially when the camera catches her in profile so we can see her nose in all its glory . ) ' Old Mother Riley's Circus ' isn't very funny ( neither are any of the others in the series ) , but this feature benefits from a higher budget than most of the others , and by a rousing tap-dance number by a shapely brunette who is unmentioned in the credits . There are some impressive ( and expensive ) burst wipes during the opening credits . This time , Old Mother Riley is given a backstory that renders Lucan's character even more implausible than usual . Years ago , Old Mother Riley was the young and beautiful Maggie O'Hara , a star in the variety halls until her no-good husband George left her and took their infant daughter Kitty . The elderly Lucan is utterly implausible as an old woman . To assert that ' she ' used to be a beautiful young actress is a notion that's too grotesque to be funny . When Old Mother Riley mentions that she performed in tights , the mental image is not a pleasant one . When Old Mother Riley is offered a job in a cinema , and she covets one of the scanty uniforms worn by the pretty usherettes , this is apparently meant to seem like the wistful desire of an old woman to relive her young days as a beauty . As Lucan performs the scene , he comes off like an old drag queen drooling over a new frock . Intriguingly , although male actor Lucan is playing a biological female in all the Mother Riley films , they usually contained at least one reference to Lucan's true gender . In ' Circus ' , this comes when an actor says scornfully of Mother Riley : ' Anyone can see SHE's no lady ! ' Speaking of cross-gender casting , there's a very bizarre scene between Old Mother Riley and a young clerk at the labour exchange . The clerk is played by an attractive young actress . . . but she's dressed as a young man , has short-cropped hair , and she speaks her lines in what appears to be an intentionally deepened voice . I honestly can't tell if this character is meant to be a young man ( played by a woman ) or an androgynous girl . The ambiguity serves no purpose except to make the whole movie seem weirder . Kitty McShane is prettier than usual here in her circus cozzy , an Annie Oakley get-up with a short skirt and gauntlets . This film varies the usual formula of Lucan's and McShane's on screen relationship . Kitty is still playing Old Mother Riley's daughter , but this time they've been separated since Kitty's infancy , and are reunited only by chance in the dodgy circus where Kitty is working as the target of a drunken knife-thrower . Implausibly , after mother and adult daughter meet for the first time , they very soon behave as if they've known each other all of Kitty's life . More impressively , Lucan does a scene in which Old Mother Riley disguises herself as a counterfeit countess . To his credit , in this sequence Lucan actually seems to be playing a completely different female impersonation from his Mother Riley turn . All of the Mother Riley films are top-heavy with puns , but ' Circus ' ( more so than most ) features British references that American viewers won't comprehend . There's a pun on the word ' stalls ' in the British sense of a theatre's orchestra seats . Lucan does a monologue about the maharajah who married a sultana , and she's his ' current wife ' . ( In England , ' sultana ' - - the word for a sultan's wife - - also means a raisin or a dried currant . ) Lucan also comments : ' All's fair in love and Wardour Street ' . . . this being the London street where most of Britain's wartime film studios had their business offices . There's also a gag about ' Dan , Dan , the lavender man ' . . . this is a cleaned-up version of a smutty joke that used to be popular among English schoolboys . Substitute ' lavatory ' for ' lavender ' and you'll get a hint . SLIGHT SPOILER . For most of its length , ' Old Mother Riley's Circus ' manages to be mildly amusing . There is ( no surprise ) a happy ending . But then comes the very last shot in the film . This is a grotesque shot of female impersonator Lucan in extreme close-up . Leering directly into the camera , he tells us in his falsetto brogue : ' Bye-bye . God bless you . See you again soon . ' And then ' she ' makes a little moué kiss at us ! No thanks ! I'll rate this movie , mostly for that uncredited brunette girl who does a sexy tap-dance .
418936	1609079	13095	3.0	Ahoy , Captain Nemo	' Ebb Tide ' is based on a novel begun by Robert Louis Stevenson and completed by his stepson Lloyd Osbourne . I tried reading it once , but found it too dull for me . This movie is more interesting ( largely due to the presence of two attractive young actresses ) , but not very believable . The stars of this film are James Kirkwood and Lila Lee , in real life a married couple whose son later wrote ' A Chorus Line ' . I only poorly remember the source novel , but this film ' Ebb Tide ' doesn't much seem to resemble it . This movie seems more like a disguised version of ' 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea ' , with all the action set above the ocean's surface . Robert Herrick ( Kirkwood ) is a disgraced and dissipated Englishman who has washed up in Tahiti . Close to hand is his comrade Huish : that's not an English name , but Huish is apparently a Cockney because actor Raymond Hatton's dialogue is rendered in Alf Doolittle-style intertitles . Hoping for a meal ticket , the two of them sign aboard with drunken old Captain Davis ( well played by George Fawcett ) . Davis is a rummy old seadog whom nobody will trust with a ship , yet for some reason he's recently been engaged to ferry a cargo of booze . Unknown to Herrick , Davis's backers are only interested in barratry . They expect the old drunk to sink the ship so that they can then claim an insurance loss . When Davis's incompetence threatens to scuttle the ship , Herrick's quick action manages to make the ship run aground instead . . . on a conveniently uncharted island . The island is run by Richard Atwater ( Noah Beery ) , who rules the natives like a great white bwana . The natives supply him with pearls , which Atwater manages to sell for whacking huge gobs of lolly in some distant port . ( How does he do this while remaining on an uncharted island ? ) Like Captain Nemo , this man Atwater has deliberately isolated himself from civilisation yet manages to amass a large amount of wealth . Also like Captain Nemo , when Atwater acquires some unexpected guests ( Herrick and Huish ) he has no intention of letting them return to civilisation . Years ago , when Atwater came to this island with his young wife and their infant daughter Ruth , his overseer tried to seduce Atwater's wife . So , Atwater killed the bloke and now he won't trust any other white man ever again . Thus , his refusal to release Herrick and Huish . Meantime , his infant daughter Ruth has grown up to be a very attractive young woman indeed . And Robert Herrick is the first white man she's clapped eyes on in years , apart from her father . Significant glances ensue in the close-ups . Lila Lee and Jacqueline Logan ( as a Tondelayo girl ) are both quite pleasant to look at , and George Fawcett is impressive in a role that easily could have been overacted . Once the vast engine of the story's premise is trundled into place , the plot becomes very predictable . ' Ebb Tide ' is left high and dry ( though there's plenty of booze on screen ) . I'll rate this movie .
418833	1609079	281766	3.0	Liza with a Zzzzzz . . .	' The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood ' was originally aired on ABC-TV on 28 November , 1965 . . . almost a month before Christmas . The material really has nothing to do with Christmas , and it's obvious that a few Yuletide details have been bunged in just to make it likelier that this production would be optioned and scheduled as a ' Christmas ' special ( which it really isn't ) so as to be more commercial and get higher ratings . The script by Robert Emmett isn't very good . . . but the score is by the great Jule Styne and Bob Merrill , the same team who wrote the songs for ' Funny Girl ' . This isn't one of Styne's best scores ( nor Merrill's ) , but anything written by Jule Styne is worthy of notice . This is a musical retelling of the Red Riding Hood story . . . told from the viewpoint of the wolf ! That's a very clever idea ; unfortunately , it's the only really clever idea in this production . The wolf ( renamed here Lone T . Wolf ) is played by Cyril Ritchard , which is part of the problem . Ritchard was an extremely effeminate performer . His effeminacy was an asset in some roles , such as when he played Captain Hook ( on a ship at sea with all those pirates , whoops ! ) or when he starred as Kreton the alien in ' Visit to a Small Planet ' . But here , his prissy demeanour makes the big bad Wolf seem merely ridiculous . As the wolf , he wears a frock coat and gloves plus a furry headpiece that makes him look like something out of ' Cats ' . . . plus a long bushy tail that makes him look like Basil Brush gone grey . Even worse are the scenes in which Ritchard's wolf gets dressed up in Granny's nightdress . Drag humour isn't funny if the man wearing women's clothes is just as effeminate WITHOUT the women's clothes . Worse luck , the story is told in flashback . Lone Wolf ( Ritchard ) is describing his version of events to the other wolves . . . who are played by Eric Burdon and the Animals . Get it ? The wolves are played by the Animals . Ha bloody ha . It might have been amusing if the Animals had got out their instruments and played ' The House of the Riding Hood ' , but no such luck . Red Riding Hood is played by Liza Minnelli . I've always disliked this performer due to her extreme archness , but I recognise her talent without enjoying it . In flashbacks , Ritchard's wolf explains that Red Riding Hood was the actual villain , and that everything which happened was her fault , not his . The woodsman ( Vic Damone ) turns out to be Prince Charming , making this production seem like an early version of ' Into the Woods ' . The best things in this production are the Styne / Merrill songs , especially " You'll Need a Song " ( sung by Damone ) and ' Ding-a-Ling ' ( sung by Minnelli and Ritchard while the wolf is pretending to be Granny ) . I'll rate this production , and most of that's for the score .
419008	1609079	34948	3.0	187 miles from Moose Head , Alaska . . .	' Klondike Fury ' is the overwrought title of a Poverty Row film that takes place mostly indoors . The opening shot is a laughably fake studio set-up of a miniature ' plane flying past some papier-mache mountains . The very few ' exterior ' shots of the Klondike terrain are clearly filmed indoors , on a level floor , as cornflake snow drifts straight downwards ( no wind ) and the actors ' breath stays resolutely unfogged . The script is based on a magazine story filmed previously ( as ' Klondike ' ) and now radically altered . The original story and previous film version featured a tough-tootsie Alaska heroine , a quick-frozen piece of hoarfrost . Here , she's been thawed out into a dimpled ingenue . The two-man ' plane crashes in the middle of the Klondike . According to the dialogue , we're " 187 miles from Moose Head , Alaska " ( yeah , but I'll bet there's a Starbuck's nearby ) . Conveniently , the only cabin within a 200-mile radius just happens to be near the crash site . The pilot dies , but the injured passenger has just enough strength to stagger across the tundra ( a few steppes ) into the cabin , where he promptly collapses . Conveniently , this cabin also contains the only blonde woman within a 200-mile radius : Peg Campbell , an orphan who's lived here ever since a tree killed her father . ( Don't ask . ) Peg has been in this isolated cabin since infancy , but she has a California accent and a steady supply of attractive outfits , and her makeup and hairstyle are impeccable . Peg is played by Lucile Fairbanks , a mildly pretty but untalented actress . Stacked like cordwood in this cabin are a bunch of picturesque characters spouting faux-folksy dialogue . ( The place also seems to have electric lights , central heating and plenty of groceries , although these issues are never addressed . ) SPOILERS COMING . The injured passenger has a Dark Secret , which he eagerly reveals in cheap flashbacks . He is John Mandre , a brilliant surgeon whose friend Carl Langton had an inoperable disease . ( The dialogue keeps mentioning this disease without ever describing it or naming it ; I diagnose Lazy Script Syndrome . ) Against the advice of his colleagues , Mandre operated on Langton . When Langton dies anyway , there are accusations that Mandre intentionally killed him to have a clear path to Langton's pretty wife . Naturally , Mandre confronts these accusations by chucking his medical career and heading for Moose Head , Alaska . ( Mandre is played by Edmund Lowe , a former silent-film star whose career was in sad decline at this point . ) Now grab a snow shovel and clear a path for the coincidences . Among the inhabitants of this cabin is handsome young invalid Jim Armstrong , who - gobsmackingly enough - has the exact same rare medical condition that Carl Langton had , which we now learn is a tumour of the thalamus . ( ' That's a part of the brain , ' says Dr Mandre , proving he didn't skip classes in medical school the day they studied brainology . ) Mandre decides to redeem himself by performing precisely the same surgery on Jim that he performed on Carl , even though this isolated cabin has no medical equipment and no health insurance . Had enough coincidences yet ? Wait , there's more ! The two surgical operations have another parallel too , because Jim accuses Mandre of intending to kill him on the operating table so that Mandre will have no competition for Peg's affections . Since Mandre is clearly operating on Jim's brain to achieve his own spiritual redemption ( with a chance to save the patient's life being merely a bonus ) , it's extremely obvious how this film ends . There's precisely one surprise on the way to that ending . I've seen a hundred bad movies in which a desperately ill or injured person holds the hero at gunpoint , reeling off a long monologue in a fevered delirium . . . only to collapse just before pulling the trigger . We get that scene here , in a confrontation between Jim and Mandre . . . but , impressively , the scene ends in an unexpected and original manner . That's the only originality hereabouts . I sat through this Arctic argle-bargle for one reason only : the presence of Clyde Cook in a supporting role . The Australian-born Cook was formerly a vaudeville acrobat of astonishing skill , known as ' the Kangaroo Boy ' . He performed on Broadway during the 1919 Actors Equity strike , and he had a respectable career in silent films as the only slapstick comedian whose acrobatic pratfalls equalled the abilities of Buster Keaton and Lupino Lane . I interviewed Cook about a year before he died ; he had a long and fascinating career . Here in ' Klondike Fever ' , 187 miles from Moose Head ( and considerably farther from Brisbane , Australia ) , Cook speaks his few lines of dialogue in a Brizzo accent . He plays a crusty codger named Yukon , although nobody explains why a guy named Yukon is speaking Strine . ( Maybe he took a wrong turn at Wooloomooloo . ) Also lurking amongst the icicles is veteran character actor Vince Barnett , who supplemented his income between film gigs by hiring himself out as a stooge for some of Hollywood's legendary practical jokes . We also get Marjorie Wood ( in flashback ) mispronouncing the name ' Frankenstein ' . The film ends with Dr Mandre returning to his old surgery , while Arthur Gardner as a would-be funny ethnic sign painter named Tony exults : ' You betcha my life ! ' Hand me my snowshoes , Nanook : I'm heading back to Moose Head . I'll charitably rate this movie , mostly because it revives my fond memories of meeting Clyde Cook .
418396	1609079	309370	3.0	It's petrified , but no ' Forest '	' Blind Alley ' was a live-television drama , transmitted in the very early days when television was still experimental . Fortunately , a kinescope recording was made of this drama , which I was able to view . Due to the technical limitations of early tv , this is a slow and static production , filmed entirely on one set , with the camera immobile . It's obvious that ' Blind Alley ' was chosen for this technical experiment due to the nature of its story : ' Blind Alley ' depicts a prolonged hostage situation , so there's a plausible reason why all these people stay in the same room instead of going elsewhere . Unfortunately , ' Blind Alley ' is much less interesting than several other hostage dramas - most notably Robert Sherwood's ' The Petrified Forest ' - which would have told a better story within the same technical and budget limitations . Dr Anthony Shelby ( Maurice Wells ) is a college professor , who lives with his wife Doris ( Katherine Warren ) in a secluded country house . They hear a radio bulletin , announcing that fugitive Hal Wilson is at large and looking for someplace to hide out from the cops . But the Shelbys live in such a remote location , surely they needn't fear such vulgar intrusions . Just then there's a knock at the door . Guess who's coming to dinner . In bursts gangster Wilson ( Charles Furcolowe ) with his mugs named Buck and Nick ( or maybe Nuck and Bick ; the sound recording's not so good ) and his cheap moll Maizie . Actress Kay Loring , as Maizie , spends most of her on-camera time pretending to chew gum , but it's obvious she isn't actually chewing any . Wilson announces that he and his gang are going to be staying a while , so everyone might as well get cosy . Oh yeah , did I mention that Dr Shelby just happens to be a criminal psychologist ? How convenient . And likewise conveniently , Wilson is afraid that he might be losing his sanity . Well , well ! Shelby offers to treat Wilson by subjecting him to hypnotherapy , then proceeds to psychoanalyse him . SPOILERS COMING . It turns out that Wilson was severely abused in childhood by his father , likewise a criminal . In his youth , Wilson grassed on his dad to the cops , resulting in his father's death . . . an event which Wilson has felt guilty about ever since . ( But obviously not guilty enough to stop him from following in his dad's fingerprints , I mean footsteps . ) Shelby then smugly diagnoses Wilson as ' a classic case of Oedipus complex ' : apparently , Wilson subconsciously wanted his father to die , because Wilson was sexually attracted to his own mother . Faced with this revelation , gangster Wilson has only one possible course of action : he whips out his gat and commits suicide . The other gangsters meekly surrender to the ( offstage ) police . Maizie actually stops chewing gum for a few seconds . I'm trying to go easy on ' Blind Alley ' , as its most glaring flaws are down to its extremely low production budget and its extreme technical limitations . But , as I said , a much better story could have been dramatised within those same limitations . ' Blind Alley ' is a laughable melodrama . My cultural references are British , so I couldn't help laughing when the gangster villain in this thick-ear drama was referred to as ' Harold Wilson ' . Still , coincidental names aside , this story is ludicrous . It's radically irresponsible for Dr Shelby to offer a glib diagnosis of someone he's only just met . Despite the unusual nature of this particular doctor-patient relationship ( Shelby is held at gunpoint by Wilson's thugs , and understandably wants to gain the upper hand ) , I still found their interaction implausible . Also , there are legitimate reasons why Wilson , in his youth , would have been motivated to betray his abusive and dishonest father , so all the claptrap about Oedipal urges doesn't carry any weight . I'll rate this chamber drama , mostly because I'm very interested in the early days of television and I want to be sympathetic to any surviving artefacts of that era .
419209	1609079	17923	3.0	Dieterle's brilliant , but not here	SPOILERS SPOILERS William ( Wilhelm ) Dieterle was a brilliant director whose career is long overdue for appraisal . He was also a talented actor in German silent films : fortunately , he switched over to directing before the sound revolution . ( As a director among the Europhile producers who ran Hollywood's studios , Dieterle's thick German accent was an asset . . . if he had been an actor in Hollywood during this same period , his accent would have been a serious drawback . ) Among his many excellent films , Dieterle directed the Charles Laughton remake of ' The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' . Simon Callow , in his splendid biography of Laughton , makes the bizarre statement that Dieterle did not have any personal eccentricities : if this were true , Callow would not have needed to say it . But for all his talent , Dieterle was a very eccentric man . Among his other penchants , he was a profound believer in numerology , and he allowed his wife to cast the horoscope for each of his films . . . often changing the shooting schedule so as to begin filming on a more astrologically favourable date . ( Jack L . Warner hated this , but Warner tolerated Dieterle's foibles because of Dieterle's unquestioned talent . ) When Dieterle was assigned to direct Paul Muni and Bette Davis in ' Juarez ' , numerologist Dieterle refused to begin filming scenes with the traditional shout of ' Action ! ' . . . because ' Juarez ' and ' Action ! ' both have six letters . I shan't discuss Dieterle's habit of always wearing white gloves . ' Das Geheimnis des Abbe X ' ( ' The Mystery of Monk X ' ) is co-directed by Dieterle , and he also plays the leading male role of a young Catholic monk who is also an amateur detective . None of the characters in this movie have names , which makes it difficult for me to synopsise the tangled plot . The monk has a brother ( i . e . a male sibling , not a priest ) whom he hasn't seen in many years , but they correspond regularly . When the brother's letters stop coming , the monk makes inquiries and learns that his brother has disappeared mysteriously . . . and the clues point to murder . When the monk investigates the disappearance , he meets his brother's beautiful young wife ( the darkly exotic Italian actress Marcella Albani ) and he immediately falls in love with her . I said that she was the brother's wife . . . but could she possibly be his widow ? SPOILERS COMING . The wife of course promptly falls in love with her monk brother-in-law ; apparently she never loved her husband to begin with . But she respects his priestly vows of chastity , so she doesn't let on that she loves him . Instead , the wife ( now accepted as a widow ) marries her late husband's neighbour , solely as a chance to get access to his land so she can look for clues to her husband's murder . Sure enough , she discovers that the neighbour murdered her husband . Meanwhile , the neighbour decides to abduct his wife's son , who is the neighbour's stepson and the monk's nephew . ( Are you getting all this ? ) When the monk tries to rescue the nephew , the neighbour drowns . Happy endings all round . This movie features some spectacularly beautiful exterior scenes ( in what looks to me like Bavaria ) and some impressive footage of St Peter's and the Vatican in Rome . But this movie is less than the sum of its parts . I'll rate this Teutonic twaddle . If there's any justice in the world , William Dieterle's career is due for a major reappraisal . . . but not based on this movie .
419074	1609079	938	3.0	I've found a French letter !	I've handled quite a few reels of nitrate-stock film from the days of silent movies and the early talkies . On more than one occasion , I've encountered a silent film from which a sequence was deliberately cut out . Unless this was an intertitle , the missing footage almost invariably turns out to have been an insert shot of a handwritten note , a typed letter or a newspaper article . In silent-movie days , in order to exhibit films in foreign-language markets , the original insert shot of a piece of text had to be removed , a substitute ( in the new language ) made and photographed , and then sufficient footage of the new image spliced into the print . Thus , for instance , we now have Lon Chaney's silent film ' The Unknown ' ( copied from a French print ) missing the original shot of Chaney's blackmail letter , and Laurel and Hardy's silent short ' Duck Soup ' ( copied from a French-language print found in Belgium ) missing the original newspaper article about the forest-fires . In both of these cases ( and many more recovered silent movies ) , a new image had to be constructed , shot , and edited into the film for modern reissue . I screened the Library of Congress print of ' The Little Darling ' : an acetate dupe made from a paper print . For some reason , the paper print - - especially made for copyright registry in the Library of Congress - - is missing the shot of the letter which triggers the plot of this brief film ; without the text of that letter , all that follows is confusing . Fortunately , I've also seen ( in Europe ) a print which includes several feet of an insert shot : a French-language version of the letter that's missing from the Library of Congress print , so I understood the plot which follows it . IMDb's synopsis of this movie ( probably from a vintage film exhibitor's catalogue ) is accurate . A boarding-house landlady receives a letter from her cousin ( that's the one we're missing ) , which announces that the cousin is sending her " little darling " to visit the landlady , arriving on this afternoon's train . ( At least , this is the text of the French version . ) The boarding-house's many bachelors - - all of them believing the " little darling " to be a child , and all of them amazingly paternal - - run out and buy various toys and a pram for the new arrival . They carry all this lot to the railway station . Off the train steps the " little darling " : a very pretty Mary Pickford , who's 17 years old and nobody's baby . Collapse of several stout parties . Mack Sennett is briefly glimpsed in this crude comedy as one of the burlier bachelors , clutching a jumping-jack toy . Before founding the Keystone studio in Edendale , Sennett had served as D . W . Griffith's apprentice at Biograph in New York City , and Sennett often paid tribute to his mentor . Pickford's sister Lottie is glimpsed here in the shop sequence . I was annoyed that several of the actors in ' The Little Darling ' perform directly to the camera , emoting in precisely that exaggerated style which has given silent-film acting a bad name . I'll rate this quickie just .
419518	1609079	22020	3.0	Meyer leaves much to desire	The terribly tragic years of the Second World War held a few minor comforts . One of the few positive ( unintended ) results of the Third Reich was the flood of European character actors who spent the war years in Hollywood , in some cases continuing their careers there after V-E Day . These include Victor Francen , Marcel Dalio , S . Z . Sakall , and Sig Arno . Although Arno was a starring comedian in pre-war German films , in Hollywood his thick accent limited him to supporting roles . Still , he carved out a respectable career ( usually playing comic waiters with funny accents ) , and many Hollywood films of the 1940s would be less enjoyable without Arno's expert comic timing . ' Keine Feier ohne Meyer ' ( the title is funnier than the movie ) is one of Arno's starring roles . The title literally means ' No Fire without Meyer ' , but in this case ' Fire ' is meant in the figurative sense of ' excitement ' . It's a comedy , but the humour falls uneasily between slapstick and farce . Arno plays Meyer , a Jewish marriage broker in Saxony who is secretly saving for himself his best client : the beautiful daughter of the local burgomeister . The daughter is played by Dina Gralla , whose Polish accent is quite thick . . . and at variance with the German character she's portraying . Her father is played by the Anglo-German actor Ralph Arthur Roberts , whose accent varies uncertainly between British and German . Vocally ( but not physically ) , Roberts reminds me of another Anglo-German actor : Henry Victor , best known as the strong man in ' Freaks ' . Victor could have had a fine career in Hollywood or Britain , if only he'd been able to keep his accent on the English side of the Channel . . . instead of wavering back and forth between his two homelands . Ralph Arthur Roberts ( what a name ! ) has the same problem in this film . The sound recording is very bad , so the mishmash of accents makes things even worse . The pacing of the film is very slow , which is especially disastrous due to the lowbrow nature of much of the ( unfunny ) comedy here . The director Carl Boese shows no flair for comedy . There are a few very nice exterior shots of a seashore and a lake , with some interesting sunlight effects , and Dina Gralla backlit against the splendid German scenery . Boese should have kept away from comedy films , and devoted his talents to the ' mountain ' film genre ( with its emphasis on nature and the German landscape ) which was so popular in German cinemas at this time . I'll rate ' No Fire without Meyer ' , and 2 of those points are for Sig Arno's performance .
419095	1609079	39790	3.0	What's black & white and Red all over ?	' Russian Question ' is flat-out Soviet propaganda , with all the clumsiness of that regime's usual cinematic agitprop . What makes this movie slightly more interesting than its brethren is that , whereas most Russian propaganda movies extol the alleged virtues of the Soviet " worker's paradise " , this one sets out to slag the United States . The central character in ' Russian Question ' is an American ( played by a Russian actor ) . Even more originally , rather than depict this American as a stereotyped capitalist , he is depicted as heroically in sympathy with the Soviet agenda : those OTHER Americans are the problem . Harold Smith ( the name suggests an Everyman ) is a crusading American journalist who has gone to Moscow to see for himself the truth about the Soviet regime . This being a Soviet movie , of course he's favourably impressed . When he returns Stateside , he receives a job offer from a publisher named MacFerson . The latter is very obviously based on William Randolph Hearst , and possibly also based on a couple of other tabloid publishers such as Bernarr MacFadden . ( Notice the similar surnames : MacFadden , MacFerson . ) The publisher , being a capitalist , is only interested in selling newspapers . . . and is perfectly willing to disseminate lies rather than the truth , if lies will sell more papers . Oh , and he's also interested in starting up a war . . . because nothing else sells more newspapers . MacFerson offers Smith lots of rubles ( I mean dollars ) to write a book about the Soviet Union , but he wants Smith to depict the Soviets as war-mongers . Smith refuses to see the Russians as war-mongers when he recalls how bravely the Red Army fought against the Nazis . ( Huh ? The fight against the Nazis was justified , but that hardly proves that the Russians were pacifists . ) When Smith refuses to lie for MacFerson , the latter uses his media influence to slander Smith as a traitor to the United States . . . slandering him so deeply that even Smith's wife Meg falls for the lies , and deserts him . The Russian actress playing Meg is tricked out in enormous shoulder pads , an elaborate peplum , and hair pulled back so severely , I had difficulty perceiving her as an American . SPOILERS COMING . There's a ' happy ' ending . . . by which I mean , an ending that suits the Soviet agenda . Eventually , Smith realises that the problem isn't merely MacFerson but rather the entire Wall Street-Washington axis , of which MacFerson is a mere cog . Smith proclaims that the real enemies of the United States aren't in the Soviet Union . . . they're in ( wait for it ) Washington ! Pass the borscht , comrade . According to the film's credits , this movie is based on a Russian stage play , by one Konstantin Simonov . I can well believe it : despite some elaborate sets , much of this film is directed as if it were a filmed stage play rather than a motion picture . What really annoys me is that this movie actually does what it accuses Uncle Sam ( or Aunt Sally ) of doing : lying to the public in order to tar the republic on the other side of the Iron Curtain . We see here sequences of the American media - - a very UN-free press - - suppressing Smith's efforts to tell the truth . . . when in fact this is exactly what the Soviet government were doing at this time to samizdat publishers . Indeed , a post-glasnost Russian cultural official has told me that Simonov later recanted everything said in this movie . There's no question about ' The Russian Question ' : it's lies , all lies , and it doesn't even tell those lies very gracefully nor credibly . My rating for this agitating agitprop : just , mostly for the impressive production design .
418859	1609079	60660	3.0	Low-key character study	' A Man Called Adam ' was tailor-made as a vehicle for Sammy Davis's talents as a dramatic actor . He should have chosen a better script , with a more sympathetic role . The main character in this movie wallows in self-pity , and then turns out to do so for the wrong reasons . As a movie , ' Adam ' is slow and boring . As a showcase for some jazz performances , ' Adam ' is considerably better . In addition to some splendid trumpet solos by Nat Adderley ( dubbing for Davis's character ) , there are superb performances by Louis Armstrong and Benny Carter , which almost ( but not quite ) redeem this movie's considerable flaws . Also on hand is Mel Odious , I mean Mel Torme , exhibiting his usual smarm . This movie's painfully low budget actually works in its favour . Leo Penn's low-key direction skilfully captures the down-and-dirty world of a jazz musician : the brassy nightclubs , seedy hotel rooms , fly-blown booking agencies and jam sessions . Adam Johnson ( Davis ) is a talented jazz trumpeter whose career is going nowhere fast . We're given to understand that he's a victim of racism , and in 1966 this is certainly plausible . But a lot of Adam's problems are his own fault . He walks out on a club date at the last minute - - a cardinal sin - - and quarrels with his honest and hard-working agent . Adam also has a drinking problem , which I found slightly disingenuous . In real life , quite a few jazz musicians have substance-abuse problems , but the substance is usually drugs . . . not alcohol . Judging by this movie , you'd think that booze is the most lethal substance in the nightworld of jazz . SPOILERS COMING . Eventually , in a well-acted scene with Cicely Tyson , Adam reveals his big secret . He used to have a wife and child , but they both died in a car accident while Adam was driving . . . he feels guilty that he survived and they didn't . Ever since , he's been taking it out on himself and everyone else . I found this movie dishonest . I accept that there were many reasons for a black man in 1966 to be angry and resentful , but Adam seems to be angry for all the wrong reasons . In the novelisation of this film , there's a chapter in which Adam spitefully plays slow jazz when a white customer wants something up-tempo . This whole film is like that , with Davis giving us something that he knows we don't want . On the positive side , Sammy Davis and Tyson give excellent performances with the bad material given them here . Ossie Davis ( no relation ) is less impressive . A lot of actors owed their success to some physical quirk : for Ossie Davis , it was an extremely deep and resonant voice . He has little else to offer here . I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Peter Lawford as Adam's agent . I've always considered Lawford a no-talent , who got by with a handsome face , a charming manner , a pleasant speaking voice and some Camelot glamour by way of his marriage to JFK's sister . Here , for perhaps the only time in his career , Lawford gives a layered and nuanced performance in a credible role . He and Sammy Davis were good friends and Rat Packers offscreen : perhaps their genuine affection enabled Lawford to do the scene here where he and Davis are at each other's throats . I was also pleasantly surprised by a scene in which Adam plays a jazz duet with white trumpeter Vincent , played by Frank Sinatra Jnr . It's no revelation that Frank Sinatra Jnr's chief claim to fame is his father's name . Here , he actually shows some talent in his own right . . . synch-playing to someone else's dubbed trumpet music , but showing easy rapport with Davis . I wish that this entire film could have matched the panache of their sequence together . I recommend ' A Man Called Adam ' for some fine jazz music , but not otherwise . My rating for this movie is .
419659	1609079	42802	3.0	Did they ever untie Winifred ?	' Old Mother Riley Headmistress ' ( this title has no comma in the opening credits ) has a higher budget than most instalments in the ' Old Mother Riley ' series . These films starred Arthur Lucan in panto-drag as Irish scrubwoman Daphne Snowdrop Bluebell Riley , and Lucan's wife Kitty McShane as Mother Riley's daughter . Like some other British comedians ( George Formby , Frank Randle ) , Arthur Lucan's films were far more popular in northern Britain than in London and the south . The Mother Riley films were also popular with children , as Lucan's drag routine was ( usually ) too innocent to raise the spectre of transvestism . ' Old Mother Riley Headmistress ' is a bit naughtier than usual for this series , due to the setting . . . which places Old Mother Riley in a gymslip among dozens of nubile young ladies . The Dublin-born Kitty McShane's accent varied wildly from thick brogue to shopgirl Estuarine throughout the series . In ' Headmistress ' , she settles for a slight Irish lilt . Mother Riley works in a laundry owned by her sister-in-law Jemima Murphy . Kitty Riley is the choir mistress at St Mildred's Seminary for Young Ladies . We see McShane unconvincingly attempting to conduct the ( excellent ) girls ' choir . When she leaves the room , they carry on singing in tempo without her , proving she was never needed . The vicious French instructress Mam'selle Leblanc has contrived to get Kitty sacked . . . until Aunt Jemima carks it , bequeathing the laundry to Mother Riley , who mortgages the laundry to buy the seminary and instal herself as headmistress . I'm a fan of the " St Trinian's " comedies , so I hoped that St Mildred's would be filled with naughty schoolgirls in gymslips . The girls at St Mildred's are all in their teens and wear pretty frocks , not matching uniforms . They all gang up on a girl named Winifred who has a speech impediment . I was annoyed that ALL the schoolgirls ( except Winifred ) are extremely pretty : how realistic is that ? Also , Winifred is played by an attractive girl ( Diana Connell ) made to look unattractive with thick specs and an ugly hairstyle . There's a sequence in which the schoolgirls taunt Winifred while she's bound and blindfolded . I found this rather kinky , yet I was disturbed by it : the audience are clearly meant to approve while the pretty girls bully poor Winifred . The tone of the schoolgirl sequences is all very jolly hockey-sticks and Enid Blyton . All the Mother Riley films have bad direction and poor editing . ' Headmistress ' features a sequence in which Mother Riley plays ' The Minstrel Boy ' on a piano while a bust ( of Shakespeare ? ) above the piano comes alive and speaks to her . This could have worked if the director had shown us the inanimate bust , and then shown it opening its eyes and speaking . Annoyingly , we see this bust for the very first time as it starts speaking , and this is very confusing . SLIGHT SPOILERS . ' Headmistress ' places heavy reliance on undercranking ( speeded-up action ) , which I've never found funny . This is especially dire in a bizarre scene in which Kitty encourages Mother Riley ( a man in drag , remember ) to twirl in her elaborate new dress . But the jokes are a bit cleverer than usual for this series . When a Latin-speaking lawyer arrives , Mother Riley tells him ' pro bono Pimlico ' ( a pun on a working-class London neighbourhood ) . She introduces ' his workshop , the Mayor ' whose name is Weston , and he's ' a super mayor ' ( a pun on the seaside resort Weston-super-Mare ) . When Mother Riley is embarrassed , she asks : ' Is my Rhode Island Red ? ' The climactic sequence , in which the seminary catches fire , features an impressive optical wipe that changes shape like a flame . The dialogue establishes that all the girls went home for the hols before the school burns down . ( But did they ever untie Winifred ? ) Oh , yes . We get that annoying cliche about the worthless piece of property that's suddenly valuable because the railway want to build a line through it . I've seen this cliche in several Yank cowboy movies , but this is the first British movie in which I've encountered it . The cliche makes no sense : if the railway need a particular piece of land , the government would exercise the law of eminent domain to seize the land at less than market value . The people who make money from a new railway line are the people who own the land next to ( not ON ) the rail line , and who get rich by building hotels or restaurants that cater for the rail travellers . Speaking of cliches , we also get that British thick-ear cliche : the gang of Cockney spivs with a toff as their " guv'nor " . None of the ' Mother Riley ' films are very funny , but ' Headmistress ' is more enjoyable than most because of all those attractive teenage seminary girls , who sing very prettily . No schoolgirl uniforms , worse luck , and only Mother Riley wears a gymslip , but we get to see the lasses briefly in form-fitting P . E . clothes and short-skirted band uniforms . At the very end , there's a clever coup de theatre which changes Mother Riley's laundry into a railway station . I'll rate this series entry , which is higher than most of the Mother Riley films deserve . Recently , I was told by Roy Hudd - a veteran of the old-time English variety halls ( vaudeville ) - that , when the Old Mother Riley films were being made , Arthur Lucan always arrived at the movie studio in full ( female ) costume and make-up , and he remained in character until he went home ( still in drag ) . Allegedly , he didn't want anyone to know how he looked out of costume , so that ( when he wasn't working ) he could visit the local pub or chip shop without being recognised as a celebrity . I don't know if I believe this story , but it does explain why I've never seen a photograph of Arthur Lucan in which he is not wearing his Irish scrubwoman disguise !
419255	1609079	40111	3.0	I'm with it , but this movie's without it	In the days when travelling carnivals and circuses were common in America , these shows would often pick up temporary employees along their tour routes . The temporaries might be performers , or might be day labourers ( roustabouts ) , or might be entrepreneurs ( not always honest ones ) selling candy or cheap toys , or running some sort of game ( usually a con , such as three-card monte ) and hoping to make some money for their own pitches from the rake-off of customers who came to see the circus or carnival . Because people who travelled with the circus or carnival were constantly encountering new people , and couldn't always be certain if the newcomers were carny folk or ' civilians ' , they developed the habit of asking ' Are you with it ? ' . . . meaning , ' are you part of this travelling show ? ' . Veteran circus people and carny folk knew what this question meant , but civilians were more likely to reply : ' Am I with WHAT ? ' . This is why someone who is knowledgeable or avant-garde is described as being ' with it ' . ' Are You with It ? ' is a pleasant low-budget musical with a carnival background and no impressive songs . Donald O'Connor plays a rather stiff young nerd named Milton who has a high I . Q . and is very good at maths ( he uses a slide rule while he talks ) , but who is out of touch with his emotions . He loses his job and falls in with some troupers from a passing carnival , including flashy Vivian ( Olga San Juan , cheap and vulgar ) and fast-talking carny pitchman Goldie ( Lew Parker , giving a deft performance of such skill that I'm amazed he didn't go on to a greater career as a character comedian ) . The script forces O'Connor to play a character that's a very poor choice for the protagonist in a musical comedy . About twenty minutes into the movie , some music starts playing and Milton taps one foot idly . Then he breaks into a spirited tap dance , casually explaining that tap dancing is merely a physical application of elementary scientific principles . I didn't like this , me . Donald O'Connor is a brilliant dancer , one of the best who ever performed in films . . . so it's utterly implausible that a wonk like Milton ( who shows no interest in having a good time ) could attain such a level of dancing skill simply by applying his intellect . ' Are You with It ? ' is enjoyable but hardly memorable . O'Connor's dancing is excellent ( as always ) , and he's in better singing voice here than he was in several of his other ( better ) musicals . But the songs which he's singing and dancing aren't especially good . George Balzer , who worked on the script , wrote some of Jack Benny's funniest radio and tv material . . . but you'd never know it from what's on offer here . Veteran comedian Walter Catlett has almost nothing to do in this movie , and he's easily upstaged by Lew Parker . I'll rate ' Are You with It ? ' : that's one point for Lew Parker's performance , and one point for each of Donald O'Connor's tap-dancing feet .
419128	1609079	10045	3.0	' Dangerous Hours ' ? More like ' Dangerous Howlers ' .	The best thing about the movie ' Dangerous Hours ' is its title . I've never made any secret of the fact that I despise all forms of communism , especially the Soviet variety , and that I also despise movies which depict communism favourably . Well , ' Dangerous Hours ' is fervently anti-communist , and yet it delivers its message so dishonestly ( and manipulates the audience so egregiously ) that I very nearly felt sorry for the communists ! I certainly felt sorry for the actors lumbered with playing Trotskyites in this inept movie . Handsome but bland Lloyd Hughes plays John King . With a name like that , you know he's a crusading idealist . He observes a picket line at a silk factory , and then notices that outside agitators ( redlegs ? ) are infiltrating the union . When John tells a policeman that these agitators are merely trying to uplift humanity , the cop ( in a nicely cynical line ) replies that they can do it someplace further up the street . Along comes exotic blonde Sophia Guerni . With a name like that , you know she's a slimy foreigner . Sophia has a penchant for wearing heavily frogged shirts of the style usually favoured by Volga boatmen ; the rig makes her look like Eugene Onegin . Enticed by Sophia , naive John involves himself in the workers ' struggle , not realising that he's merely being duped by the bolshies . Into this borscht bounds a bolshevik who rejoices in the monicker Boris Blotchi . With a name like that , you know he's a filthy agitator . Boris is Blotchi by name and blotchy by nature . He's also a Russian communist who has come to the United States with the specific agenda of organising American labourers away from their legitimate grievances and into a movement to overthrow democracy . He and Sophia are in cahoots . . . I mean , they're comrades in the revolution . SPOILERS COMING . It's clear to us ( but not to John ) that the coldly beautiful Sophia is interested in him only because she can exploit him as a dupe . But the rather less exotic May Weston is attracted to John unselfishly . . . and May is 100 % yankee-doodle American . It's no mystery how this movie will end , but before it gets there John is embroiled in a climactic strike action that turns into a riot . ' Dangerous Hours ' does address real issues . When this movie was made ( 1919 ) , organisations such as the International Workers of the World were trying to organise and unionise American labourers . . . but those organisations were heavily infiltrated by communists and other agitators who had their own agenda that contradicted the workers ' interests , and most Americans ( including the labourers ) wisely mistrusted such organisers . Unfortunately , ' Dangerous Hours ' makes no attempt to address the issues honestly . This movie's intertitles constantly editorialise , telling the audience how we're supposed to think at every point in the narrative . As a staunch advocate of democracy , I'm always annoyed when dramatic works which advocate democracy don't trust their audiences or readers to think for themselves . All of the communist characters in this film are stereotypes , and the actors depict them accordingly . The bland Lloyd Hughes is now remembered only for ' The Lost World ' and ' The Mysterious Island ' , two science-fiction films in which he was easily upstaged by ( respectively ) a runaway brontosaurus and a horde of platypus humanoids . In the early sequences of ' Dangerous Hours ' , Hughes's blandness actually works in his favour ; we accept him as a blank slate on which the wily Sophia can write her agenda . Later in the film , when John King recovers his wits and his conscience , Hughes is less believable . Interestingly , two years after starring in ' Dangerous Hours ' , Lloyd Hughes gave possibly the best performance of his career in ' Hail the Woman ' : in a supporting role , again as a naive young man who is easily led ( this time by his father ) yet who again recovers his integrity and his courage by the final reel . ' Dangerous Hours ' and ' Hail the Woman ' were both scripted or co-scripted by C . Gardner Sullivan ; I suspect that Hughes's vastly superior performance in the latter film was down to the expert direction of John Griffith Wray . . . a much better director than Fred Niblo , who helmed ' Dangerous Hours ' . Wray's premature death was a great loss to the cinema . Some of the other reviewers on IMDb seem to feel that I rate movies based on whether or not they stroke my own personal predilections . If that were true , then - - since I'm extremely anti-communist and pro-democracy - - I had ought to give high marks to ' Dangerous Hours ' . In fact , although I agree with this movie's politics , I dislike its weak story telling , its dishonest depictions of communists , and its inability to trust the audience to think for ourselves . My rating for this one : just , mostly for the production values . Pass the borscht , comrade .
418418	1609079	31214	3.0	Wanna buy a dead duck ?	Joe Penner was an extremely untalented and physically unappetising man who starred in a few low-budget comedies . Basically , Joe Penner was Lou Costello without the sex appeal . ( Or Frankie Howerd with less effeminacy . ) If Penner is now remembered at all , it's only because he was the source of a catchphrase that continues to resurface : ' Wanna buy a duck ? ' This was Joe Penner's most significant contribution to comedy , but even this was only down to a process of elimination . The Hungarian-born Penner started out in American burlesque as a baggy-pants stooge , but he failed to get any laughs . He developed the gimmick of walking out on stage carrying a random prop , and interrupting the straight man to ask him : ' Wanna buy a ( whatever object Penner was carrying ) ? ' Time after time , this business got no laughs . Eventually , Penner came out onstage clutching a wooden hunting decoy , and he asked the straight man : ' Wanna buy a duck ? ' This got a huge laugh , and a star was born . . . very briefly . Penner parlayed that one gag question into a brief career as a radio and film comedian . On the radio , Penner developed one other catchphrase that was briefly popular : ' You nassssssty man ! ' Penner merits a footnote in animation history , as his vocal schtick was the inspiration for Warner Brothers ' early cartoon character Egghead , who eventually evolved into Elmer FuddJoe Penner's best film was ' The Boys from Syracuse ' , in which he played a dual role via trick photography . But the merits of that film are largely due to the Rodgers and Hart score and several other cast members , not Penner . ' The Day the Bookies Wept ' ( great title , lousy film ) is more typical of Penner's output . This story is an attempt at imitating Damon Runyon's distinctive universe of gamblers and wise guys , but it's far below Runyon's standard . A fleet of cab drivers have decided to pool their savings and invest in a racehorse . But the nag they end up with is named Hiccough , out of Bourbon , by Distillery . ( That's the funniest gag in the picture . ) It turns out that Hiccough always runs dead last , at least when he's sober . Ah , but when Hiccough drinks beer . . . he becomes the fastest thing on four legs ! Penner plays a pigeon-breeder who implausibly ( and ineptly ) gets hired as the horse's trainer . He decides to run Hiccough as a long shot and then get the horse drunk so he'll win at long odds . Movies about animal abuse are very seldom funny . ( And I know for a fact that horses will strenuously refuse alcohol . ) The best and funniest performance in this film is given by veteran comic actor Tom Kennedy . Thurston Hall is welcome , as a blowhard named Colonel March ( no relation to Boris Karloff's one-eyed detective of that name ) . I'll rate this movie , mostly because I'm a sucker for 1930s movies full of character actors with Brooklyn accents .
418695	1609079	788085	3.0	Feat of clay .	Some of my American friends are huge fans of the Gumby animation shorts by Art Clokey , which don't appeal to me at all . Invariably , it turns out that these people first encountered Gumby when they were small children . I never even heard of Gumby until I was well stuck into adulthood and I had already encountered more sophisticated ( and more recent ) examples of stop-action animation and claymation . Still , even by the standard of their own time - - the 1950s - - the Gumby toons aren't very impressive . Norman McLaren and George Pal were already doing far more sophisticated stop-motion animation and pixilation , in McLaren's case with no bigger a budget than Clokey's . The wistful title ' Gumbasia ' suggests that Clokey wanted this to be his equivalent of Disney's ' Fantasia ' : an art film with images and sounds but no story . Seen from a modern viewpoint , this is a very primitive example of claymation from the prehistoric Plasticine Era . Against a soundtrack of some jazz-ish riffs , we see bits and blobs of clay rolling about aimlessly . At several points during an early sequence , we see a sphere of clay ( and its shadow ) rolling across a blank background ; there's no other object in the frame , so there's no relative motion . I suspect that Clokey achieved these shots in real time , merely panning the camera past a static ball of clay and then allowing the editing to imply that the clay is rolling past a static camera , a stop-motion effect that would have taken much longer to film . At the end of this sequence , two blobs of clay roll towards each other and colllide : this bit was definitely filmed in stop-motion . Despite its brevity , I found ' Gumbasia ' completely unengaging right up until the very last shot , when a crude clay face suddenly winks its eye at us and smiles . For that brief instant , this film came alive for me , with this clay face far more engaging than all the blobs and balls which have preceded it . This only proves that film is most interesting when it's about human beings ( or characters we can accept as human substitutes ) rather than special effects . Mostly for its historic value , I'll rate ' Gumbasia ' .
419513	1609079	13064	4.0	Brazil , where the nuts come from .	I saw ' The Destiny ' in July 1996 at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna ; they screened a restored print with the original Portuguese intertitles . This creaky melodrama is an extremely silly film , and I sat through it only because I've seen very few Portuguese silent films and I'd wanted to get a better sense of that nation's film product from the silent era . ' The Destiny ' reminds me of ' Last Year at Marienbad ' for all the WRONG reasons . We see some beautiful , well-dressed people in a posh locale : their backgrounds are an enigma to us , and also to each other . Unfortunately , all similarity ends there . ' Marienbad ' was intentionally cryptic for the sake of being cryptic : the makers of ' The Destiny ' clearly want to pull a succession of rabbits out of their figurative hat , astonishing us with a series of surprising revelations . . . but the end result is merely ludicrous . The story ( such as it is ) takes place among a colony of Portuguese aristocrats in Brazil . The pillar of this community is Countess Maria Da Silva Oliveira . The colony's languid existence is disrupted by the arrival of an elderly blind man ( Antonio Pinheiro ) who seems to harbour a dark secret . Then comes the even more sudden arrival of a mysterious black-clad middle-aged lady ( Maria Branco ) who - - get this , please - - has amnesia . SPOILERS NOW . In the course of determining this lady's identity , the countess discovers that the amnesiac is her own ( the countess's ) mother , and the blind man is the amnesiac's father , therefore her own ( the countess's ) grandpa ! What's the Portuguese for " hoo boy " ? Further , it develops that various relationships between various members of the colony are not what they seem . It turns out that each and every member of the colony is in some manner a mere ( gasp ! ) pawn of Destiny . Oh , blimey ! Here we have an early example of what would later become known in Italy as a ' white telephone ' movie : a film concerning itself with the idle rich , and expecting the rest of us to give a hoot about their alleged problems . Since ' O Destino ' was made for a Portuguese audience , it's not surprising that all the characters are Portuguese , but I was annoyed that the film-makers chose to set this story in a Portuguese colony in Brazil , thus giving it an imperialist undertone that was possibly not intended . It was difficult enough for me to care about these wealthy layabouts , but I had even less enthusiasm for them when I realised that their leisure was probably obtained from the toil of Brazilian peons . This film's message is that each of us is helpless in the face of Destiny . Fair enough , but I was annoyed that the film-makers chose to use a colony of wealthy aristocrats as their microcosm to symbolise all of humanity . It would have been a more humanist - - and more interesting - - drama if they'd chosen a broader cross-section of Portuguese society for their cast of characters . My rating for this one is only , and that's mostly for the production design and photography .
418651	1609079	17588	4.0	Jumping Gemini	Oh , blimey ! This is one of those movies about identical twins : one good , one evil . How often does this actually happen in real life ? High-society hostess Evelyn Trevelyan ( a name which almost rhymes ) is happily married to Adam Trevelyan . . . never suspecting Adam's secret , namely that he has an evil identical twin brother Allan . Of course , as soon as Evelyn learns about this brother-in-law , who until just now was utterly unknown to her , guess who shows up on her doorstep . Confusions between good brother Adam and bad brother Allan promptly ensue , made more complicated when Allan deliberately impersonates Adam . Allan has been squiring a floozy named Gwen ; when Evelyn sees Gwen in the arms of Allan ( who looks like Adam ) , she assumes that her husband is unfaithful . This movie is meant to be a comedy , but the best jokes are in the gaggy title cards written by comedy veteran Ralph Spence . Lew Cody , an actor who has never previously impressed me , actually manages to turn in two different performances as the twins , so that we can tell which one is actually onscreen in any given shot . ( Except when the script requires us to be intentionally confused . ) The most interesting thing about this movie is the crude process photography which enables Lew Cody to interact with himself in double-exposure . Most of the film is lighted normally . . . until both of Lew Cody are onscreen in the same shot , at which point suddenly the set is lighted from the sides , so that one Lew Cody doesn't throw shadows where the other Lew Cody will be standing ( in the other half of the exposure ) . At one point , Adam hands a piece of paper to Allan ( or maybe it's just the other way round ) : in order to achieve this stunt , the set dresser conveniently places a table lamp in precisely the right spot to obscure the physical contact between the two characters played by Lew Cody . This is an MGM film , so ( as usual for that studio ) the set design and art direction are contractually credited to Cedric Gibbons , but were actually done by one of his assistants . . . in this case , Richard Day . ' Adam and Evil ' is slightly funny , but not nearly so funny as it seems to fancy itself to be . It would have helped if the two main characters hadn't been named Adam and Evelyn . ' Trevelyan ' just makes everything worse . Rating : .
419619	1609079	24027	4.0	Chopsticks and choo-choos	' Fleuchtlinge ' translates into English as ' flightlings ' or ' refugees ' . From a modern viewpoint , it's easy to dismiss this movie as German propaganda , 1933 vintage . Actually , it's a fitfully suspenseful action drama which depicts its German protagonists ( and Germans in general ) more sympathetically than denizens of China and the Soviet Union . ( As much as I despise Nazis , the communists were worse . . . so I have no problem with that equation . ) The action takes place in 1928 , so technically none of the characters here are citizens of the Third Reich . . . but the tone of German nationalism and chauvinism throughout this film is heavy indeed . Hans Albers plays a German who served in the Kaiser's army during the Great War . Now , in 1928 , seriously disillusioned , he lives in China : still serving the German government as an attache in Nanking . Albers has been dutifully serving the Manchurian empire . . . but now the Kuomingtang uprising has begun ( actually , it started in 1925 ) and things are getting hot and spicy . There's a settlement of German citizens in Nanking ( or at least , there's one in this movie ) , and its residents ask Albers's help to get to Manchuria , where the emperor's forces are still in power . Albers declines , until he gets into a dispute with a local commissar . This causes him to realise his true loyalties . From this point , ' Flightlings ' becomes similar to ' Von Ryan's Express ' , with the escapees being Germans . Albers and the other Germans hijack a railway train , and they highball for the border . SPOILERS COMING . There is some action and some tension - movies set on moving trains are pretty much boredom-proof - but it never quite gels . Kathe von Nagy is dull as the female lead , although her character shows some ingenuity instead of being a mere helpless damsel . Karl Rainer gives a good performance as a Tintin-like young German who gets killed during the escape . Another refugee ( Franziska Kinz ) gives birth in the freight van , and her newborn son is hailed as a fine new German citizen . The whole film appears to have been filmed in Germany , even though much of it takes place in provincial regions of China and Russia . As there were not many Chinese actors on offer in UFA's casting pool , all the troublemakers in Nanking are depicted as Russians ( played by German actors ) . I admit that I don't know much of the history of this case , but I suspect that the filmmakers are overstating the Soviet Union's role in China's revolution for reasons of racial convenience . The photography by Fritz Arno Wagner is absolutely impeccable throughout . The direction varies widely from taut suspense to slack longueurs . It's distressing to see a German film that's so blatantly propagandistic , made slightly before Hitler really got going . Hans Albers gives a good performance in a badly-written role : he seems to be imitating some of those strong silent Gary Cooper he-men who were just a little too iconic to be plausible . I'll rate this movie .
419399	1609079	438076	4.0	Art Carney lets it all hang out ; Lucy wets the bed .	I'll say straight off that I've never been a Lucille Ball fan . But I'll give her some credit , or rather half-credit , for attempting to do something different here . The TV movie ' Happy Anniversary and Goodbye ' was Ball's one-off attempt to portray a credible human being , rather than her usual wacky redhead . Unfortunately , ' Happy Anniversary and Goodbye ' wasn't quite serious enough to be a genuine drama , and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy either . Ball and Art Carney play Norma and Malcolm Michaels , a middle-aged married couple in midlife crisis : their anniversary is coming up , but he's decided he's tired of her and he wants a divorce . She feels similarly , and she agrees to a trial separation . Carney has really let himself go here . The former beanpole of his Ed Norton days is gone forever . In an early scene in the couple's bedroom , Carney's paunch is quite visible . This opening scene is unpleasant for other reasons too , with Ball's and Carney's characters insulting each other ( very bitterly , not amusingly ) and no real chemistry between them as performers . Norma decides she's still young enough and attractive enough to make a new start . . . so she heads for Las Vegas , where she meets quite a few handsome men . ( Lucille Ball briefly ogles Arnold Schwarzenegger here ! ) Eventually she meets smooth-talking Peter Marshall , who sweet-talks her into his hotel suite . ( Marshall is excellent here . ) We can tell he's a playboy stud because he's got a waterbed . And he's ready to make Norma his next sexual conquest . . . Ball actually does some good acting here , conveying her character's conflicting moods . We sense that she wants to jump into the sack with Marshall . . . partly to spite her husband Malcolm , and partly to prove to herself that she still has some sexual appeal . Yet she also conveys that , on some level , she still loves her husband and doesn't want to cheat on him . The reason why I give Lucille Ball only half-credit rather than full credit for trying something new here is because she clearly didn't trust herself to pull it off , and she decided to add some ' insurance ' in the form of her usual so-called ' wacky ' Lucy antics . Norma is wearing high heels when Marshall tries to get her into his waterbed . She can't get past him , so she jumps ONTO the waterbed and runs across it in her high heels . Of course , the waterbed springs several leaks . Marshall and Ball are running round in circles ( or rectangles , rather ) on top of the waterbed while it spews improbable gallons of water onto both of them , as if they're performing " Singin ' in the Rain " . It's only vaguely funny . I was hoping that Desi Arnaz would show up with his Cuban accent , shouting " It sprung a lick ! " . Instead , the ending we get is very obvious indeed . I was also annoyed by the presence of untalented performer Sid Gould . In real life he was Ball's cousin-in-law , which is the only possible explanation for why she often gave this grossly unfunny man small but showy roles in her productions . I'll rate ' Happy Anniversary and Goodbye ' just barely . Nice try , Ball .
419304	1609079	19907	4.0	I just can't get Inuit .	I was able to screen an incomplete print of this early talkie , which features some impressive use of music and ambient sound . The star of the film is Lenore Ulric , who was a popular actress on Broadway ( often co-starring with her husband Sidney Blackmer ) , yet who never caught on in movies . . . probably because , although she possessed some glamour , she was not conventionally beautiful . The villain in this film is well-played by Ullrich Haupt , making this the only film in history to feature an actress named Ulric and an actor named Ullrich . The action takes place in Alaska in 1898 during the Klondike Gold Rush . Lenore Ulric plays Talu ( short for Tallulah ? ) , the offspring of an Eskimo woman and a white man . Despite being half-caste , somehow she's managed to harpoon a husband : Lanak , a full-blooded Eskimo . Matters are not helped by the fact that Lenore Ulric wears neatly-tailored furs in this film while her fellow Eskimos clump about in crude skins . Also , she attempts an accent in some scenes but not in others . Along comes a trading vessel , captained by Jones with Duke as his first mate . ( Some weak comic relief from Louis Wolheim . ) Talu , who hopes to get an igloo with a white picket fence , stows away on Jones's ship and then becomes his mistress . Little does she know that Lanak is in cold pursuit , following her by kayak . There's a reel missing , but when the snow settles we're in Nome and Talu is now a dance-hall girl . I was hoping she would perform under the stage name Eskimo Nell . The other dance-hall gals shun her because of her mixed blood . The climactic showdown gave me frostbite . Warren Hymer is one of my all-time favourite character actors : I was pleased to see him here in one of his earliest roles , but disappointed that he had so little to do . Based on what I saw , I'll rate this movie 4 in 10 . Lenore Ulric's acting technique was better suited for the stage .
419342	1609079	9189	4.0	Dated satire , vital viewing	Most people's knowledge of George M . Cohan begins and ends with " Yankee Doodle Dandy " , which features an embarrassing scene in which retired song-and-dance man Cohan ( played by James Cagney ) tells some jive-talking jitterbugs that he never appeared in any movies . This is simply not true , as Cagney himself knew well , because Cagney studied Cohan's performance in " The Phantom President " while rehearsing for " Yankee Doodle Dandy " . " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " is a seriously dated satire , on a subject which is no longer topical . But George M . Cohan is a vitally important performer , and his film appearances are so rare that any film in which he appeared is must-see viewing . ( Cohan's last film , " Gambling " , appears to be lost ; evidence indicates that all the prints were intentionally destroyed at Cohan's request . " The Phantom President " remains the best example of Cohan's performing talent . ) In the same way that Cohan's hit Broadway musical " Little Johnny Jones " was inspired by a real person ( the jockey Tod Sloan ) , " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " was inspired by the career of Billy Sunday . In the early twentieth century , Sunday ( his real name , apparently ) was a professional baseball player who spent most of his off-hours getting drunk . One day he supposedly had a religious conversion and became an evangelist , preaching the evils of alcohol and the joys of Christianity and total abstinence . Newsreel footage of Billy Sunday proves that he put on quite a show , leaping and shouting and howling at the devil and Demon Rum . In the years leading up to the First World War , Billy Sunday was a major figure in America's growing movement towards Prohibition . But Sunday was a controversial figure in his own time : he made a lot of money out of his religious " crusade " , and some observers cynically noted that Billy Sunday conveniently " found " religion at just the time when his baseball career was faltering , In " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " , George M . Cohan ( who somewhat resembled Billy Sunday ) plays a man named Billy Holiday ( hmmm . . . ) who is clearly a parody of Billy Sunday . Holiday is a bartender who never takes a drink because he believes that alcohol is evil , although he doesn't seem to mind making money off it . One day he decides to close down his bar and " hit the trail " , spreading the word about teetotalism . This film has one impressive scene in a subway station , and elsewhere there are some heavy - handed jokes at the expense of Germans . . . understandable for 1918 . " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " isn't very effective for modern audiences , as few people nowadays have even heard of Billy Sunday , and Prohibition isn't likely to win many 21st-century supporters . In a world of crack cocaine and Aids , it's hard to get worked up over a glass of beer . But any film containing George M . Cohan merits serious attention . I'll rate " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " for a rare glimpse of Cohan , one of the twentieth century's most important entertainment figures .
419589	1609079	18137	4.0	Surgery perjury	George Melford's reputation has risen sharply in recent years . For decades , his best-known film was ' The Sheik ' , starring Valentino . In the 1990s , a Cuban archive released a rare print of the Spanish-language version of ' Dracula ' which Melford directed concurrently with Tod Browning's English-language version , using the same sets and costumes . Melford's production is widely considered superior to the Browning version . And yet , Melford's CV ends with a long list of undistinguished low-budgeters . Is he an underrated director , or was he a mediocre talent who just occasionally had bursts of inspiration ? ' A Man's Past ' shows Melford to be an extremely variable director . There are some impressive frame compositions here , and the overall pacing is good , but two of the leading cast members overact so badly that Melford must be faulted for failing to restrain them . Fortunately the central role in this drama is played by Conrad Veidt , who never gave a bad performance . SPOILERS COMING . Veidt stars as Dr Paul La Roche , a French surgeon who intentionally killed a terminally-ill patient who was in chronic pain . It's clear to us that this was euthanasia , and that La Roche's motives were good , but he was convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years ' hard labour in a prison on an island off the coast of France . Of course , the prison governor is corrupt and the warders are sadists . We see Veidt looking like Edmond Dantes : gaunt , with long stringy hair and beard . The governor's assistant is Lieutenant Destin , played in epicene manner by Arthur Edmund Carewe . When a prisoner snatches a warder's gun and shoots the prison governor , the resident medical officer is unable to remove the bullet . ( This sawbones is played by Charles Puffy , who was Puffy by name and puffy by nature : a coarse-looking man who simply fails to radiate the intellect appropriate for this role . ) Destin offers La Roche a pardon if he saves the governor's life . Of course , La Roche succeeds . Of course , the governor reneges on the deal . Up until now , La Roche has stoically accepted his sentence . . . but now that his personal honour has been blemished , he decides to escape . Vive la France ! Donnez-moi le fromage ! La Roche washes up in Marseilles , where he meets the beauteous Yvonne Fontaine , sister of a prominent surgeon . Dr Fontaine's eyesight is failing , so La Roche steps in and does the surgery for him . Brilliantly , of course . This gives Yvonne an idea : they can maintain La Roche's freedom and her brother's reputation by moving to Algeria , where nobody knows them . La Roche will live openly as Dr Fontaine , performing surgery in his name . Fade in , and now the ' Fontaine ' clinic in Algeria has become world-famous . La Roche is now attracted to Yvonne , but the relationship is stymied because he's pretending to be her brother . Eventually , guess who shows up in Algeria . Zut Alors , it's Lieutenant Destin . Of course he meets Yvonne and is attracted to her . Then he meets her ' brother ' , whom he recognises as escaped convict La Roche . The rivals square off . It would be satisfying to see La Roche kill Destin , but then he would be guilty of a murder less defensible than the one that got him nicked in the first place . So , the scriptwriter hands a firearm to the blind Dr Fontaine , who uses his last remaining remnant of retina to aim his weapon and kill Destin . Veidt's performance is ( as always ) impressive , and Ian Keith as Dr Fontaine offers a goodish turn in a role that gives him an excuse to chew the scenery . Far more annoying are Barbara Bedford and Carewe , both of whom seem to think this movie is Amateur Night . It doesn't help that every plot development in this story seems to trundle into place like clockwork . It's too bad that Veidt's restrained performance isn't in a better movie with a different script . As it stands , I'll rate this film .
419092	1609079	22089	4.0	Thelma Todd rehearses her murder .	Hal Roach produced his comedy series " The Boy Friends " concurrently with his Laurel & Hardy and Our Gang shorts , yet the Boy Friends never achieved the success of those classics . The three girls in the series - - Dorothy Granger , Mary Kornman and dishwater-dull Gertrude Messinger - - have very little screen presence and are not especially attractive . As for the Boy Friends themselves : Mickey Daniels ( nominally the leading Boy Friend , having come up through the Our Gang series ) is spectacularly ugly , and his trademark tic - - a high-pitched squeal - - is downright annoying . Grady Sutton , before and after this series , would prove his worth repeatedly as a supporting actor in literally hundreds of movies . . . but as slow-witted Alabam in the Boy Friends series , Sutton's namby-pamby character is annoying and fails to hold interest . This leaves only one Boy Friend : Dave Sharpe . Handsome , with good screen presence , a superb acrobat and athlete , Sharpe probably failed to become a star for the same reason as the very different actor Claude Rains : both men were too short to be acceptable in romantic roles . In ' Love Fever ' , Dave Sharpe is first seen performing mule kicks , then balancing in a handstand for an upside-down close-up . He's great ! Unfortunately , the three Boy Friends have no chemistry together , nor do they have any real chemistry with their girls . If Hal Roach had tailored this series as a star vehicle for Sharpe , it might have worked . ' Love Fever ' is no better than any other instalment in the Boy Friends series , but is interesting for two reasons : a guest appearance by Thelma Todd , and because the structure of this movie shows the weakness of the entire series . Rather than interact with each other or their girl friends , the three lads take it in turns to interact with Thelma . This short has a triptych structure , which would be fine if any one of its three segments were funny . At best , they're slightly amusing . For some reason , the series characters at the Hal Roach Studio were usually named after the actors who played them . I find this deeply annoying and often confusing : Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were not idiots , so it's regrettable that the two bowler-hatted simpletons they portrayed in Roach's comedies were usually named " Stan Laurel " and " Oliver Hardy " . In ' Love Fever ' , we have Thelma Todd playing a successful actress named Thelma Todd : is she portraying herself , or playing somebody else with the same name ? The meta text becomes even weirder when Thelma starts rehearsing a play in which she gets murdered : just a few years later , Todd would actually die in bizarre circumstances which may have been homicidal . Any old how , the girls have temporarily dumped the boys just before the arrival of glamorous actress Thelma . When Thelma rehearses her dialogue , each of the three Boy Friends ( in series ) overhears her fending off her nonexistent murderer , and each one in turn gallantly rushes in to defend her . ( Sort of like a serial murder , only with the same woman getting killed three times . ) The movie's script and direction cleverly establish that Thelma is flirting with the boys only so as to effect a reconciliation with their girlfriends . Alas , her flirtations with Alabam ( wearing a bizarre blazer ) and with Mickey are painfully unfunny . Wisely , the script saves the best for last : Thelma's tryst with Dave Sharpe . He puts on a dazzling display of dives and rolls , battling Thelma's nonexistent assailant . Unfortunately , in order to show Sharpe's athletic form , the camera must pull back to a long shot . . . thus preventing us from seeing Sharpe's face . For all we know , that's a stuntman doubling for Sharpe . In fact , Dave Sharpe spent most of his career in long shot , doubling for less talented actors . Due to his slight build and short stature , he was often called upon to don female disguise so as to stunt-double for actresses . The best films in the Boy Friends series were directed by Gordon Douglas . ' Love Fever ' finds him only in front of the camera , this instalment being helmed by the much less talented director Bob McGowan . However , I was intrigued by one brief camera set-up : when Dorothy Granger bangs on Thelma's door , the shot is set up from the door's point of view ! I'll rate ' Love Fever ' just barely . Now , please pass me the Laurel & Hardy DVDs . . .
418855	1609079	24296	4.0	. . . but not daring enough	' The Man Who Dared ' is an awkward film . It is presented as a work of fiction , but the plot line is clearly inspired by the true story of Anton Cermak , the son of East European immigrants who overcame his impoverished childhood to become mayor of Chicago despite rampant municipal corruption and voter fraud . In 1933 , Cermak ( a Democrat ) was standing beside Franklin Roosevelt's car , outside their party's national convention in Miami . A man jumped out of the crowd , aimed a revolver at FDR , and then fired . . . killing Cermak . The gunman was arrested and identified as Giuseppe Zangara , who claimed to be an anarchist . He was brought to trial , convicted , and executed . The ' official ' version of this story is that Zangara was a genuine anarchist who meant to assassinate Presidential candidate Roosevelt but accidentally shot Cermak instead . However , Cermak had been active in breaking up the lucrative Cosa Nostra rackets in Chicago ( bootlegging , illegal gambling rings , etc ) , and Cermak had cost the Mob a lot of money . Credible evidence indicates that Zangara was a small-time Mafiosa who intentionally carried out a ' hit ' on Cermak , carefully staging it to look like a failed attempt to kill FDR so as to avoid government reprisals against the Mob for Cermak's murder . The whole Cermak / Zangara affair was retold in 1960 on the ' Untouchables ' TV series , as a two-part episode called ' The Gun of Zangara ' , which I recommend for its comparatively accurate depiction of the case . ' The Man Who Dared ' was rushed into production immediately after Zangara's arrest , and the haste shows . . . abetted by the very low production budget . This movie follows the Cermak case closely , except that the names are changed : the Cermak character ( played earnestly but blandly by Preston Foster ) is renamed Jan Novak . Given the name changes , it's surprising that this story of urban corruption is explicitly set in Chicago , rather than in some anonymous ' big city ' . The best performance in the film is given by Zita Johann , whose real-life Hungarian accent is here ( perhaps for the only time in her Hollywood career ) an asset rather than a debility . In this film ( as Novak's wife ) and elsewhere , Zita Johann had a remarkable ability to convey that she was genuinely in love with her male co-star . Leon Ames is good in the early scenes as Novak's father . An interesting visual device runs sporadically through this movie . Early on , we see a billboard which reads ' Welcome to Chicago ' , but the billboard is so caked with mud that it is nearly illegible . When Cermak / Novak is first elected mayor , we see a municipal employee scrubbing the billboard so that it is slightly cleaner . Later , as the new mayor institutes his civic reforms and his crime-busting activity , we see a worker hosing down the billboard until at last it is finally clean . SLIGHT SPOILERS . Movie audiences in 1933 , recognising this film's parallels to Cermak's life and death , must have realised that the entire film is building up to Cermak's murder and the assassination attempt on Roosevelt . Sadly , this climactic event is tossed away almost as an afterthought . Throughout the second half of the film , we hear ominous dialogue to the effect that Novak / Cermak has ' enemies ' . In the last few minutes of the film , we see him attending a political rally . ( This movie's small budget doesn't allow for a full-fledged convention . ) We see Novak smiling and walking towards the camera , about to shake hands with a political bigwig ( presumably FDR ) who is located just offscreen . Suddenly the camera cuts to a tight close-up of a man's hand clutching a revolver as it fires two bullets . We do not see Novak fall . . . instead , the camera cuts to the last shot in the film : the Chicago billboard one more time , once again splattered with mud . The message here is that nothing has changed , and that the real-life Anton Cermak accomplished nothing more than a brief respite in the war against organised crime , which went back to business as usual immediately after his death . Sadly , ' The Man Who Dared ' tells us absolutely nothing about the murder of either the real-life Anton Cermak nor the fictional Jan Novak . We never see the man who killed him , apart from that close-up of his hand . We never learn the gunman's motives : was he aiming for Novak , or did he kill Novak by mistake while aiming for the Presidential candidate ? None of this is addressed in any way . For a film about a man who dared to take on the rackets and a corrupt political system , this movie is disturbingly gutless . The script is by Hollywood stalwarts Dudley Nichols and Lamar Trotti , both of whom have done much better work in other films . I'll rate ' The Man Who Dared ' , as an interesting example of high-speed low-budget Hollywood film-making , and for Zita Johann's fine performance in a too-brief role .
418491	1609079	18457	4.0	Oy , oy , oy ! Mine daughter loves a goy !	Mary Philbin deserves at least a permanent footnote in movie history , as the actress who memorably unmasked the Phantom of the Opera in Lon Chaney's greatest film . She also gave a fine performance as the blind heroine in ' The Man Who Laughs ' , directed by the brilliant Paul Leni . Apart from these two films and ' The Last Performance ' ( also by an exceptional director ) , Philbin's career is nothing much . Her beautiful looks far exceeded her acting ability , and she wasn't able to carry a film in the lead role . In ' Surrender ' , Philbin plays the central role . . . and her talents simply aren't up to the job . The poor script and lacklustre direction don't help . The action is set in 1914 , in a Jewish village in Austria , near the eastern frontier . Philbin plays Lea , the beauteous daughter of the local rabbi ( Nigel De Brulier ) . The town is invaded by a division of Cossack soldiers , commanded by a colonel named Constantine . ( It doesn't help that the intertitles refer to this warlord by his forename rather than his surname . ) Constantine's cossacks are all set to pillage the village , but there isn't much worth stealing . . . so Constantine vows to burn the place to the ground . Then he spots beautiful Lea , and changes his mind : the village and its people will be spared if Lea will have sex with him . SPOILERS COMING . Lea appears to be the standard silent-film heroine , virginal and noble , so it's surprising that her nobility exceeds her virginality . To the surprise and outrage of her father , Lea agrees to spend the night with Constantine in order to save her village . Rather surprisingly , and implausibly , she and Constantine fall in love with each other , and he repents his former actions . ( You call yourself a Cossack , fella ? ) ' Surrender ' is one of those annoying movies which subscribes to the view that , if a man harasses a woman long enough , she'll eventually fall in love with him . This movie is extremely overwrought , and much of the blame goes to the subtitles . . . which read like something out of a Mills & Boon paperback romance . There's plenty of blame left over for the actors , most of whom overact wretchedly . Otto Matieson gives a performance of some subtlety . The film ends tragically but also implausibly , when the rabbi decides that he must strangle his own daughter for the dishonour she has brought upon him . Nigel De Brulier looks like he would blow away in a stiff wind , so I couldn't believe he was capable of strangling Philbin . Also , the close-ups reveal the pale irises in Philbin's eyes : I can't tell what colour her eyes are in this monochrome film , but these close-ups weaken the casting of Philbin as a ( presumably Ashkenazi ) dark-eyed Jewish princess . ( Let's have no jokes about ' Princess Lea ' . ) The best thing about ' Surrender ' is its title , which turns out to have at least three meanings . Edward Sloman was a deservedly obscure director , whose best film is likely ' Murder by the Clock ' . I'll rate ' Surrender ' , and I'm being generous .
419167	1609079	14145	4.0	The French are revolting .	" I Will Repay " is based on one of the numerous Scarlet Pimpernel novels by Baroness Orczy , which I haven't read . I don't know how faithful this film is to its source novel , much less how accurate either of them is in regard to the historic names and events that are freely mentioned throughout the proceedings . We are in Paris , 1793 : knee-deep in the Reign of Terror . Paul de Roulade ( Pedro de Cordoba ) is a hero to the Jacquards , who cry him ' Citizen de Roulade ' . One evening he gets into an argument with the Vicomte de Marny over the virtues of a dancing girl ; this leads to a fight ( provoked by the viscount , of course ) , forcing Paul to kill the nobleman . ( I'm astounded that any viscount would dare show his face in Paris in 1793 . . . but don't mind me , scriptwriter . ) The viscount's sister Juliette de Marny ( Flora le Breton ) swears revenge : to achieve this , she infiltrates the de Roulade household and beguiles Paul into falling in love with her . Now get this , folks . The movie wants Paul to be the film's hero and earn the audience's sympathy , even though ( as a Jacquard ) he's really on the wrong side of history . So , just to keep things nice and tidy , Paul has secret Royalist sympathies . He decides to smuggle Marie Antoinette out of France . . . and to do this , he enlists the aid of none other than the Scarlet Pimpernel ( Holmes Herbert ) . How does the scriptwriter explain this complete volte-face on the part of the main character ? By having actor de Cordoba flutter his hand languidly while a dialogue title has him moaning that he's weary of ' all this bloodshed ' . Oh , yes ! Well , the fair ( or unfair ) Juliette learns of Paul's intrigue , and she realises that this is her chance to get revenge by betraying him to the Jacquards . Or will she fall in love with him as he has with her ? Meanwhile , we get a few scenes of Charlotte Corday on trial for the murder of Marat . Au secours ! There was so much real-life drama going on during the French Revolution , there's really no need to invent fictional shenanigans like this . I'll at least give this European-made film credit for realistic sets and costumes , rather than the usual overblown glitz that Hollywood would have given this subject matter even as early as 1923 . Still , my rating for this film is only .
418408	1609079	263673	4.0	Stan and Ollie did it better .	The German word ' lumpen ' - - as in ' lumpen proletariat ' - - has no precise English equivalent . It would translate somewhere between ' people of the labouring class ' and ' people who don't matter ' . This film's title ' Lumpenball ' refers to a social event - - a ball - - held by and for such people . ' Lumpenball ' was released in Germany just a week before Lon Chaney died in California , yet somehow this movie feels like something from back in the Mack Sennett era . I found much of this film to be deeply embarrassing , since it's firmly mired in a subclass of marital comedy which is now very archaic : the concept that husband and wife are automatically adversaries ; that a husband can only ever have a good time by sneaking out on his wife , and that it's a wife's duty to prevent her husband from having fun . This short of mindset belongs firmly in the era of Maggie and Jiggs , Laurel and Hardy , ' The Honeymooners ' , ' The Flintstones ' and Donald McGill's seaside postcards . However , SOME of the above are still quite funny ( I'm not talking about YOU , Fred and Barney ) , so perhaps I'm being too harsh towards ' Lumpenball ' . Yet the fact is that I didn't laugh very often while watching this comedy . . . and , when I did , I felt slightly embarrassed that I WAS laughing . Here's the gripping narrative : Doktor Rodenburg Gerhard is an old married man , so of course his wife Eva is a shrew . Their daughter Pauline is married to Amadeus Krause . . . and I felt that the name ' Amadeus Krause ' was the funniest joke in this movie . Frau Krause is a shrew just like her mother , so the two husbands are allies in their misfortune . The two men meet two gaudy young females named Fiffi and Lola who are allegedly ' dancing girls ' ( says this film's dialogue ) , but that's clearly a euphemism for something else . The husbands flirt with these girls , who invite them to the Lumpenball . But in order to get the Lumpenball rolling , Rodenburg and Amadeus will have to get past the Gerhard wife and the Krause spouse . SPOILERS AHEAD . Gerhard fakes a telegram from his very respectable friend Herr Doktor Wiegand ( an attorney ) , claiming an emergency that requires the husbands ' immediate attention . They rush off , leaving their wives at home . Then a visitor arrives : the real Dr Wiegand , unaware that his name has been used as a pretext . The wives quickly rumble that their husbands are up to no good . At the Lumpenball , the husbands switch clothes with two cross-talk comedians named Schluck and Priem , and likewise don the comedians ' stage make-up . When the wives show up , they spot Schluck and Priem wearing masks ( and the husbands ' clothes ) , and assault them with the German equivalent of rolling pins . The joint gets raided , and afterward the husbands have the gleeful satisfaction of seeing their wives publicly exposed as having attended the Lumpenball , whilst the husbands had their fun without any penalty . I well and truly felt as if there were mothballs coming out of this movie , and the only novelty of the situation ( for me , at least ) was that it was being staged within the German culture rather than that of Britain's Whitehall farces or American vaudeville . When this movie was released in 1930 , Hitler was just getting warmed up . I wonder if these sorts of shenanigans were still being enjoyed by the German working-class just a couple of years later . My rating for this lump of balls ' Lumpenball ' : just . If you want to see a much funnier movie with a similar premise , watch Stan and Ollie in ' Fraternally Yours ' .
418870	1609079	61308	5.0	A sobering experience .	I saw ' Twice a Fortnight ' ( which works out to once a week , ha ha ) when it was originally transmitted by the BBC on a weekly basis . The programme lasted precisely five fortnights ( i . e . , ten weekly episodes ) in late 1967 , terminating just before Christmas . In fact , I was a member of the studio audience for one episode , which is noteworthy because of this programme's unusual relationship with its studio audience . As it now stands , the only real achievement of ' Twice a Fortnight ' is that it gave Michael Palin , Terry Jones , Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie a chance to get some television experience , and to make some beginners ' mistakes , before going on to their legendary success in Monty Python ( Palin , Jones ) and the Goodies ( Garden , Oddie ) . The programme was a flop largely because these lads didn't know what they were doing . . . but they learnt very quickly indeed . ( A previous IMDb reviewer , AlaGls1 , is mistaken : Terry Jones and Michael Palin were both on-camera performers in ' Twice a Fortnight ' , although only in the film sequences shot outside the studio . ) Bill Oddie was keen to do a series involving audience participation . This led to the first mistake : the studio audience were seated much nearer to the performers than usual , encouraging the audience to feel that they were part of the comic anarchy . The second mistake was the notion to ' warm up ' the audience by serving drinks to them before the show ( including alcoholic bevvies , if they so chose ) . I think that this idea was down to the director Tony Palmer : at all events , he wasn't the first to try this ; it was previously done by ' That Was the Week that Was ' , which catered for rather a different studio audience . The third mistake - - almost certainly Palmer's - - was the decision to hand round noise-makers to the audience before recording each episode . So , we've got boozed-up audience members , armed with noise-makers and practically sitting in the performers ' laps , whilst encouraging them to join into the insanity . Can you see where this is heading ? One of my least favourite viewing experiences was a midnight screening of ' The Rocky Horror Picture Show ' , in a roomful of idiots intent on proving that they were more clever than the performers . . . only they weren't . I got a very similar sensation while trying to watch ' Twice a Fortnight ' . In several of the episodes which I viewed from home ( in transmission ) , most of the in-studio sequences were almost totally indiscernible , due to the constant whooping , interruptions and unfunny wisecracks of the audience . The single biggest reason why I went down to the Beeb's theatre in Shepherds Bush and joined the studio audience for one of the later episodes was because I was hoping I might get a chance to hear the actors ' dialogue if I was in the same room with them . Some hope ! Fortunately , by that point in the run of the series , the free booze had been curtailed and the audience were comparatively restrained . Only just . The best aspect of the in-studio sequences was that they included performances by really first-rate rock acts . How's this for starters ? The Who , Cream , Cat Stevens , Moody Blues , Small Faces , and Scaffold ( featuring Paul McCartney's brother Mike McGear ) . It was these musical interludes - - and ONLY the musical interludes - - which evoke fond memories of ' Twice a Fortnight ' for me when I'm watching some top-name musical act on ' Saturday Night Live ' . The only resemblance between ' SNL ' and ' Twice a Fortnight ' was the reliable presence of some first-rate rock'n'roll acts . ( And a too-rowdy studio audience drowning them out . ) The comedy sequences performed in the studio for that awful audience were largely dire . In hindsight , they feel like incredibly bad imitations of Monty Python skits . . . generally , the ones featuring two men sitting on stools , one interviewing the other . Perhaps if these skits had been funnier , the studio audience would have been more co-operative . . . and the larger audience watching the transmissions at home would have been able to hear the dialogue . What saved ' Twice a Fortnight ' - - ever so barely - - were the film inserts , which were recorded previously in exterior locations , without any audience apart from a few goggling pedestrians . ( These clips were aired on CC monitors for the studio audience's benefit . ) The funniest film sequence in ' Twice a Fortnight ' was a sketch about midget policemen , played by actual midgets in constable cozzies . Just the sight of a bunch of helmeted midgets wielding truncheons and doing Constable Plod routines ( " Here , now , wot's all this , then ? " ) is hilarious in itself . But this sketch became even weirder ( and funnier ) because the actors performed their movements BACKWARD , while filmed conventionally . The film was then played in reverse , to have the actors moving forward . . . but with a weird alien appearance to their movements which is difficult to describe . If you've seen the Red Dwarf episode ' Backwards ' , you'll recognise the effect I mean . It would be great if Auntie Beeb could issue a ' Twice a Fortnight ' compilation DVD , featuring all of the musical performances and film clips . The studio sketches weren't very funny in the first place , and are made even less tolerable due to the live audience's antics . I'll rate this comedy series - - not very funny , yet historically ( and musically ) important - - .
418943	1609079	13251	5.0	' Battling Butler ' on horseback	' The Hottentot ' has strong similarities to Buster Keaton's film ' Battling Butler ' , made a few years later . In both movies , the main character is ( at the beginning ) an ineffectual and clumsy man who coincidentally has the same name as a popular athlete . In both movies , mistaken identity leads the klutz to substitute for his athletic namesake . Both films are comedies , yet in each case the story leads to a dead-earnest climax in which the protagonist must suddenly develop athletic prowess . Also , both films were based on successful stage plays : ' The Hottentot ' was originally a play by veteran stage actor Willie Collier . The stagebound origins presented no problem for ' Battling Butler ' , in which the central sport was boxing . But the sport in ' The Hottentot ' is steeplechase racing , which is nearly impossible to depict in a theatrical production . When ' The Hottentot ' played onstage , the climactic events had to occur offstage . In this film , no such problem occurs . Douglas MacLean ( a fine light comedian ) plays Sam Harrington , a high-strung young man who happens to have the same name as a popular steeplechase jockey . Sam ( this one ) has never been on a horse in his life , and in fact he's afraid of horses . But he enjoys impressing people who think he's the famous jockey . To take advantage of this , Sam starts strutting about in riding boots and jockey silks , while boasting of his race victories . Eventually the imposture gets out of hand , requiring Sam to substitute for his namesake in a real steeplechase . He reluctantly goes along with this , hoping to impress pretty Peggy Fairfax . Come the day of the race , Sam discovers that the horse selected for him to ride is a notoriously ferocious black stallion . . . the Hottentot ! Comic events ensue . ' The Hottentot ' is an amusing comedy that never becomes first-rate , largely due to the unconvincing staging of the racing sequences , but also due to the bland performance of Madge Bellamy in the female lead . Another similarity between this film and ' Battling Butler ' is that , in both movies , the hero receives substantial assistance from his loyal manservant . In the case of ' Battling Butler ' , Keaton is abetted by his resourceful valet Snitz Edwards . In ' The Hottentot ' , the best performance is given by Raymond Hatton as Sam's unflappable butler named Swift . ( Swift by name , yet hardly Swift by nature . ) But ' The Hottentot ' is not so hot . ' Battling Butler ' is better . In the early 1960s , an interviewer asked Buster Keaton to name his favourite of his films : Keaton was expected to plump for ' The General ' or ' The Navigator ' , but he surprised everyone by choosing ' Battling Butler ' . . . probably because of its deadly-serious climax . I also consider ' Battling Butler ' the most generic of Keaton's films : it's the only one of Keaton's starring vehicles in which I can most easily imagine almost any other silent-film leading man doing as well in the lead role . ' The Hottentot ' has the same feel as ' Battling Butler ' but isn't nearly as good . I'll rate this movie . Whoa , horsey !
418462	1609079	11102	5.0	' Deep Purple ' ? More like pale lavender . . .	' The Deep Purple ' is based on a stage play ( about which , more in a moment ) . I was surprised to discover that William Cameron Menzies was this film's art director . . . and disappointed , once I'd seen the results . Menzies was the greatest art director in the history of films , but his work here is a far cry from his brilliant achievements in ' Thief of Bagdad ' and ' Things to Come ' . In fairness to Menzies , it's obvious that this film was made on an extremely low budget , with actors who were obscure even in their own day . Raoul Walsh , the director , shows his usual excellent pacing but little of the slam-bang realism that would distinguish his later efforts at Warner Brothers . Walsh served as his own producer here , which may explain the pinchpenny production values . William Lake ( Stuart Sage ) is a mining engineer who went out west with some mining equipment he invented , and promptly made a fortune : now he and his millions are back east and in search of a wife . For some reason , this extremely wealthy man is staying in the seedy boarding-house run by landlady Kate Fallon ( Helen Ware ) . In the dialogue titles , several people identify her as ' Fresno Kate ' , which ought to be a tip-off that she can't be trusted . Ought to be , but isn't . There's a burgeoning romance between Lake and virginal Doris Moore ( played by the dull Miriam Cooper ) . Unfortunately , along comes suave villain Harry Leland ( Vincent Serrano ) , who looks and acts like Snidely Whiplash on Thorazine . Leland is accompanied by several henchmen and henchwomen , the most interesting of whom is " Pop " Clark . . . whose nickname is due to the fact that he looks and behaves like a saintly father figure . Leland contrives to set up Lake for the old badger game , using Fresno Kate as bait . Naturally , this queers the romance between Lake and Doris . Soap-opera complications ensue . I was very intrigued to see Wilson Mizner's name in the credits of this film . Although Mizner briefly worked as a screenwriter , he apparently had no direct input into this movie : Mizner was co-author of the stage play ' The Deep Purple ' on which this film is based . Mizner was one of those larger-than-life characters whom no author of fiction would dare to invent . In a career course similar to that of this movie's fictional hero , Mizner went west to make his fortune . . . in Mizner's case , in the Klondike gold rush . But , from all accounts ( including his own boasts ) , Mizner made his Klondike wealth as a pimp , as a blackmailer and from various other illegal lurks . The character in this movie who most nearly resembles the real Mizner would be villain Leland . A few years ago ( as I write this ) , Stephen Sondheim tried to write a musical about Wilson Mizner and his brother Addison , who was only slightly less colourful . I was disappointed that Sondheim's project never gelled . . . possibly because the careers of the Mizner brothers are only barely believable . And this movie , too , is less plausible than it might be . British actress Louise Mackintosh gives an impressively understated performance as the hero's widowed mother , but most of the other cast members overact . I'll rate ' The Deep Purple ' only .
418497	1609079	9088	5.0	Semon second-class	Buster Keaton's ghost-written memoir ' My Wonderful World of Slapstick ' contains a perceptive comment about silent-film comedian Larry Semon : he tended to pack his films with impossible gags that were funny but completely implausible . According to Keaton , audiences laughed harder at Semon than at more plausible comedians ( such as Keaton ) . . . but afterwards were unable to recall what they'd laughed at . Interestingly , both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy ( separately ) worked as second banana to Semon before they teamed up . In John McCabe's excellent bio ' Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy ' , Laurel recalled a scene from ' Frauds and Frenzies ' in which he and Semon played escaped convicts : Semon , envious that Laurel was getting more laughs , staged a scene in which Laurel's wrists were handcuffed round a tree . . . and then merely left him there , with Semon getting the rest of the film to himself . When I viewed this print of ' Frauds and Frenzies ' , I was surprised to find no such scene . In fact , I was surprised to see Semon and Laurel billed jointly , and playing as if they were a double-act starring equally . Laurel is largely missing from the final sequences , but in all their footage together they're pretty much co-stars . Sadly , too much of the business here seems to be second-hand . Semon and Laurel do a hat-tipping gag that was done better ( and earlier ) by Chaplin and Roscoe Arbuckle in ' The Rounders ' . The film's basic situation is copied from Chaplin's ' The Adventurer ' , a classic of comedy . Semon uses a gag here which Keaton used seven years LATER in ' Seven Chances ' , but the gag is so tasteless that I'm reluctant to give him ' credit ' for it : Semon glimpses a well-dressed lady and proceeds to flirt with her , then recoils when he discovers that she's black . More positively , at least the supporting actors here ( the prison warders ) are physical grotesques who are funny in their own right , and the film climaxes with a Keystone-style chase . Plus there are some nice exterior sequences in Bronson Canyon . I didn't understand some physical business in this movie , which an American friend explained to me was the working-class game of ' matching pennies ' . The intertitles have some amusingly obsolete slang : Semon's and Laurel's characters are described as ' sofa sheiks ' , and one character expresses approval by remarking " It's the lizard's eyebrows . " Although Larry Semon's films did well at the box office , he was a poor businessman and went bankrupt during the awkward transition to talkies . Officially , Semon died ( at age 39 ) of pneumonia . . . but some evidence indicates that his family staged his death , so that Semon could escape his debts and start a new career under another identity . Semon's goblin-like features are so distinctive that they make this difficult to believe . . . and his features are also so grotesque that ( for me , at least ) they actually undercut his appeal as a comedian . I'll rate ' Frauds and Frenzies ' just . Although Semon was not a front-rank comedian , he did better films than this .
419260	1609079	25629	5.0	Robert Young in his skivvies	' Paris Interlude ' is based on a play by S . J . Perelman and his wife Laura ( nee Weinstein ) . Laura Perelman's chief claim to fame was that she was the sister of the grossly overrated cult author Nathanael West . S . J . Perelman is remembered for co-authoring two Marx Brothers movies and ' Around the World in 80 Days ' , for which he won an Oscar ( which he used as a doorstop ) . In my opinion , S . J . Perelman is the greatest author in the history of the written word , but that greatness is conveyed in his brief humour pieces ( ' feuillettes ' , he called them ) in the New Yorker magazine . Perelman's stage plays are negligible , and most of his screenplays are no better . ' Paris Interlude ' takes place on the Left Bank of that city , but all the main characters are American expats with brittle sophistication . Julie Bell is attracted to Pat Wells , a genial toper who will probably never amount to anything . She realises she'd do better to marry Sam Colt , a macho war correspondent who lost his left arm during a previous assignment . When Colt goes off to cover the war in China ( there's always a war in China ) , Julie stays in Paree to become a fashion reporter until Colt's return . She makes the acquaintance of Cassie Bond , a wisecracking clothes designer . ( I'm astonished that any American would move to Paris to become a fashion designer , with any expectation of beating the French at their own game . . . but plausibility is not this film's strong suit . ) When Colt is reported killed in action , Julie reluctantly accepts a marriage proposal from Rex Fleming , a pompous golf pro . The best things in ' Paris Interlude ' are two supporting performances . Ted Healy shines as the wisecracking publican of the Brass Monkey , the American bar where all the expats soak up the atmosphere ( among other things ) . The great character actor Edward Brophy is a notch below his usual standard as Ham Farnsworth , a befuddled Yank reporter whose editor has assigned him to go to Russia to cover the brilliantly successful five-year plan . Brophy's character seems to have been inspired by Walter Duranty , the N . Y . Times correspondent who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reports about the wonderful land reforms in the Soviet Union . It's now known that Duranty lied about genocides and famines in the Ukraine , and recently ( as I write this ) his Pulitzer was posthumously rescinded . But Duranty was a deliberate liar , whereas Brophy's character in this movie is just a poor sap who doesn't know what to believe . Still , he's funny . I wish I could say as much for Una Merkel . . . who has never impressed me in any film , and who here does her usual turn ( with her annoying voice ) as the dame who's seen it all , dearie . SPOILERS COMING NOW . It's no surprise that Colt's death turns out to be a false report . Meanwhile , Robert Young ( as Pat Wells ) shows up on Julie's balcony , stripped to his skivvies . This is one of those annoying movies in which the heroine turns down a reliable guy in favour of a happy-go-lucky jerk whose only assets are his good looks and a charming manner . . . and we're supposed to approve her choice . Robert Young and dull Madge Evans are no good in the leads . Otto Kruger ( an underrated actor ) gives a good performance as Colt , but must contend with some bad camera angles as he tries to conceal the fact that he's a two-armed actor playing an amputee with one arm stuffed into his coat . Still , Kruger does a better job here ( concealing his left arm throughout the entire film ) than Wallace Beery did ( also playing an amputee ) concealing his right arm for two-thirds of " O'Shaughnessy's Boy " . I really wanted to like this film , due to my tremendous admiration for S . J . Perelman . But the best I can give ' Paris Interlude ' is . The biggest flaw in this movie is that - except for Ted Healy's bartender - there isn't a single character here whom I'd actually want to meet .
418234	1609079	1164621	5.0	Don't blink , or you'll miss it .	' Nightwalking ' is a very short film ; it's really more of an anecdote than a full-fledged story . We see an attractive young woman walking down a dark street while we hear her worried thoughts in voice-over . Then we see a slightly scruffy young man walking behind her . His voice-overed thoughts indicate his concern that she might think he's stalking her , so he decides to ring his mother on his mobile while he's walking , in the hope that the young woman will realise that stalkers don't ring their mums in mid-stalk . Something suddenly happens to the man ; we witness this first from the woman's viewpoint , and then from a viewpoint slightly removed from the man himself . Unfortunately , what happens to him isn't immediately clear : I had to screen this short movie three times before I twigged . Director Dan Cormack ( who shows signs of great talent ) stages the action on a dark street , so some confusion is due to the darkness . Still , he should have staged the climactic event much more clearly and unambiguously . . . which might have required the services of a professional stuntman . Once I finally understood what had happened to the young man , I couldn't be certain as to whether I was meant to laugh at his fate or sympathise with him . I was intrigued by the screenwriter's decision to show the same action from two different viewpoints . Still , that final confusion seriously impaired my enjoyment of this film , and for that reason I'll rate it only .
419133	1609079	148486	5.0	Where's Bullwinkle when we need him ?	' Moose on the Loose ' is mid-level Heckle and Jeckle . Although I'm a fan of the two magpies , I'm always faintly annoyed by Jeckle's alleged English accent , which wouldn't fool anyone in Britain . For some reason , in ' Moose on the Loose ' is accent is even dodgier ( and more elaborate ) than usual . Trying to spot continuity errors in a cartoon is a mug's game , but ' Moose on the Loose ' is even slacker with continuity than it needs to be , with the magpies wearing hunting outfits that disappear and reappear for no reason . The two lads decide to hunt a moose , and naturally the moose doesn't like this . I thought the premise was a slightly odd one for Heckle and Jeckle , who more typically play confidence tricksters . There's one very funny female-impersonation sequence here , with Heckle and Jeckle sharing a panto costume to impersonate a female moose . My rating for this toon : .
418826	1609079	16874	5.0	Their careers went up in flames	I viewed the Turner-Time / Warner print of this movie . ' The Fire Brigade ' is a firefighting drama which also manages to be a piece of propaganda for firefighters . . . as if these brave souls needed any spin control . There are several firemen characters in this film , and without exception all of them are depicted as brave , resourceful and selfless . No pyromaniacs or cowards , as in the later ' Backdraft ' . The fire-fighting sequences are exciting and well-staged , often making the actors seem to be in genuine danger . . . and the film-makers are clearly pleased to show these fictional firemen using the very latest ( genuine ) fire-fighting equipment , vintage 1926 . I fear , though , that modern viewers would laugh at much of this equipment , which of course is primitive by modern standards . Also , this movie's soap-opera subplot considerably dilutes the excitement . Charles Ray plays the latest in an Irish-American family of firemen . He's engaged to marry Helen Corwin ( May McAvoy ) , the daughter of a wealthy building contractor . Unfortunately , her dad ( Holmes Herbert ) is a crook : he has knowingly committed safety violations in several of his buildings ; this increases his profit but it also means the buildings are firetraps . You can see where this is heading . The final scene is exciting , with Ray trapped on a burning rooftop with a golden-haired little girl . Tom O'Brien is excellent as Ray's older brother , who is a member of the same fire brigade . DeWitt Jennings , an underrated actor , is splendid as the fire chief whose job is made more difficult by conniving politicians . ' The Fire Brigade ' saddens me because of the fate of its leading players . The very beautiful blond May McAvoy and the handsome Charles Ray were both stars in silent films , but they plunged into obscurity very quickly when talking pictures arrived . May McAvoy was the leading lady in the early part-talking film ' The Jazz Singer ' , although she had no lines on the soundtrack of that movie . But soon she had to face the microphone : her talkie roles revealed that she had a lisp and an indecisive manner , and the sound revolution proved she wasn't much of an actress . The tragic course of her career is summed up perfectly by two of her credits : in the 1925 silent classic ' Ben-Hur ' , May McAvoy was the leading lady . . . and in the 1959 remake of ' Ben-Hur ' , May McAvoy was a faceless extra in the crowd scenes . Charles Ray's career followed a less spectacular version of the same arc . He was a star in silent films , usually playing good-hearted country boys . His voice proved unsuitable for talking films , and soon enough he was working as a dress extra , wearing a tuxedo in nightclub scenes . That's show biz , I suppose . I'll rate ' The Fire Brigade ' .
419420	1609079	476980	5.0	Ann Miller in a rubber cat-suit	' Dames at Sea ' was originally a micro-budget stage musical that affectionately guyed the big-budget Warners musicals directed by Busby Berkeley in the 1930s . The tiny off-off-Broadway musical had the good luck to cast the mega-talented Bernadette Peters in her star-making role . I didn't see the original stage production , but I've seen some amateur and stock versions in addition to this television special . This TV production of ' Dames at Sea ' retains the low-scale , easy-does-it staging of the original production , only slightly more magnified with minor embellishments that the original show couldn't afford , such as chorus dancers . This is one mini-musical that could have been improved with some of the big-budget splash that ruined Ken Russell's film version of ' The Boy Friend ' . As it stands , the most notable thing about this missed opportunity is that the female roles have been cast with actresses possessing complementary names : Ann-Margret , Ann Miller , Anne Meara . Several of the characters in ' Dames at Sea ' are lifted bodily from character templates in the Warners musicals starring Ruby Keeler , Dick Powell and Joan Blondell . Just in case we don't take the wink , the characters are named Ruby , Dick and Joan . SPOILERS AHEAD . In Act One , we witness the final rehearsal of a Broadway musical that's allegedly long on talent but definitely short on production money . The star is Mona Kent ( Ann Miller ) , tap-dancing her way through the big production number ' Wall Street ' . Oops ! Mona can't go on tonight ! But who can replace her ? Could it be that fresh-faced young ingenue Ruby , played by Ann-Margret with a lush coiffure of carrot-coloured hair ? Meanwhile , the creditors are circling . Here comes the funniest line in this show : ' There's a bulldozer in the lobby , and it's heading for the orchestra pit . ' In Act Two , our lads and lassies have patriotically joined the Navy , where the boys lament that there are no ' Dames at Sea ' . Fred Gwynne , who played the theatrical producer in Act One , has now become the ship's captain . Ahoy ? Ahoy vey ! ' Dames at Sea ' is light-hearted good fun , but I wonder how wide its appeal is . It has the general appearance of a parody of those old-time musicals ( as was done in the brilliant ' Movie Movie ' ) , but audiences expecting a parody might be confused by the fact that ' Dames at Sea ' is merely a gentle pastiche . The songs - - lyrics by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller , music by Jim Wise - - are part of the problem . These ditties are deft pastiches of songs from the beloved 1930s Warner musicals . Thus , we have here ' The Echo Waltz ' instead of ' The Shadow Waltz ' . Mona's big number ' Wall Street ' manages to evoke both the title number of ' 42nd Street ' and ' The Gold-Digger Song ' ( better known as ' We're in the Money ' ) . Anne Meara's comic number ' Choo-Choo Honeymoon ' is a pastiche of ' Shuffle Off to Buffalo ' and ' Honeymoon Hotel ' . I'm very impressed by how closely ( and affectionately ) these numbers echo the originals . But that's the problem : they're paraphrases , not parodies . When we hear those numbers sung here , we have a vague sense of having heard them before . . . in bigger and better movie musicals . The nearest we get to a parody here is ' Shanghai Sue ' , which takes a few bites out of ' Shanghai Lil ' from ' Footlight Parade ' . For my quids , the most interesting thing on offer here is Ann Miller's slinky dance number in a skin-tight rubber cat suit . Apparently she had injured herself shortly before this production began , and was required to wear a rubber compression bandage on one knee . . . which gave somebody the idea of Miller doing this entire number in a form-fitting rubber outfit . Fetish alert ! I usually enjoy Anne Meara , but here - - as the best friend of ingenue Ruby - - she's doing that prole Brooklyn accent she affects occasionally , trying to channel the spirits of Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell . In the leading role of Ruby , Ann-Margret is a vortex of talent and sex appeal , but I wish she had done this role five or even ten years earlier . In ' Bye Bye Birdie ' , Ann-Margret was extremely believable as a dewy virgin who was eager to lose her virginity ; here , she's playing a role even more virginal , but the actress has acquired a knowingness and maturity ( and some age lines ) which make her less believable in the role . Indeed , except for Gwynne and Ann Miller , all the actors are too old for their roles . The period setting is not well evoked , and some of the lines here may baffle modern viewers . When Ann-Margret sings to an offstage Franklin D Roosevelt : ' Tell Mrs Roosevelt this was my day ' , modern audiences might fail to realise that this is a reference to ' My Day ' , the syndicated newspaper column that Eleanor Roosevelt wrote during World War Two . Another number , ' It's You ' , consists of a laundry-list of names that were famous in the 1930s , some of which are now forgotten . This production of ' Dames at Sea ' is enjoyable , but you'll probably have a better time if you seek out a local high-school production of this same show , and give those eager kids a big round of applause . This TV version has too many missed opportunities , and I'll rate it only .
418617	1609079	11463	5.0	Eerie prediction of Lewis Stone's death .	The 1920 film ' Milestones ' is a remake of a film ( with the same title ) made only four years earlier . This implies that the 1916 version ( which I've not seen ) was so awful that it vanished from the public memory in less than four years ' time . This 1920 production and ( apparently ) the 1916 version are both based on material by Arnold Bennett . I've read most of his novels , but the source material for ' Milestones ' is unfamiliar to me , so I can't say how faithfully this film adapts his work . The rest of this comment applies solely to the 1920 film , and may in some details contradict the 1916 production . ' Milestones ' has a triptych structure , being set in three separate periods : 1860 , 1885 and 1910 . That last is depicted in this 1920 movie as ' the present ' , even though many Americans and Britons in 1920 ( having just emerged from the World War ) were proud of their Jazz Age modernity and would object to being conflated with people from that musty era of ten years earlier . When a film takes place in several eras , the most effective narrative technique is to cross-cut between the historic periods , leaving each story unfinished while going on to the next . This technique was used in DW Griffith's ' Intolerance ' and in Buster Keaton's ' The Three Ages ' , both excellent films . A far less effective method is to tell each period's story in full before moving on to the next . ( This was done in ' Forever and a Day ' , but that film at least kept each sequence short . ) Regrettably , the latter technique is used in ' Milestones ' , and it contributes to this movie's plodding pace . In 1860 we meet a pair of young lovers who hope to marry , but whose union provokes the disapproval of their respective parents . The lovers heed their parents ' wishes , and separate to live unhappily ever after ( apart from each other ) . In 1885 , we see basically the mixture as before : another pair of lovers , more parental disapproval ; once again the lovers heed their parents instead of following their own hearts . Unhappy endings all round . Dissolve to the ' modern ' year 1910 . Muriel Pym ( played by one Correan Kirkham ; who she ? ) is the daughter of Lord Monkhurst , and so she is styled the Honorable Muriel Pym . ( That's incorrect : she would actually be styled Lady Muriel , unless she held a title in her own right . I've difficulty believing that Arnold Bennett would make this error . ) Lady Muriel ( as I shall cry her ) falls in love with Richard Sibley ( Jack Donovan ) , a handsome and industrious civil engineer who has a promising future but no money and no blue blood in his veins . Naturally , her father protests the marriage . Sibley's father Richard Senior ( Lionel Belmore ) isn't too chuffed about it either . But this being ' modern ' 1910 , the lovers decide to make their own way in the world , with Muriel renouncing her courtesy title . This is a stuffy film , due to the poor pacing and the sensation of history inevitably repeating itself . However , it has some merits . Obscure actor Carroll Fleming ( who ? ) is excellent as the Monkhurst family's butler . Harvey Clark and Lionel Belmore give their usual understated performances . Belmore had an astounding career , appearing in movies in both Hollywood and his native Britain , and playing a wide range of roles in some major films . I was pleased that in ' Milestones ' he has a conventional haircut , rather than the distracting and bizarre quiff he wore in his starring performance in Erich von Stroheim's ' Greed ' . Character actor Lewis Stone is splendid as hard-hearted industrialist John Rhead , and I was deeply unnerved by a climactic scene in ' Milestones ' when Rhead's house is stoned by radicals . This sequence is well-staged and well-directed , but I also found it unnerving because it eerily prefigures a scene in the 1936 film ' Men Must Fight ' - - in which , again , Lewis Stone plays a prominent figure whose house is stoned by protesters - - and because it even more eerily predicts Lewis Stone's real-life death : in 1953 , some boys threw stones at Lewis Stone's house ; he chased them for several streets , then dropped dead in the gutter of a heart attack . While watching this sequence in ' Milestones ' , I felt as if Lewis Stone's screen character was genuinely in danger . Despite some good performances here , my rating for this film is only .
418837	1609079	127544	5.0	At least three versions exist .	I saw ' Evangeliemandens liv ' at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy , where it was screened with three different endings . Speaking of which : several Internet bloggers ( mostly in the U . S . A . ) have questioned the accuracy of some of my IMDb reviews , claiming discrepancies between my plot synopses and the content of the movies . What those bloggers don't realise ( or what they DO realise but they don't want to acknowledge ) is that a movie sometimes exists in several different versions . This is particularly the case for silent movies released in several different languages : sometimes the person who translated the intertitles would also change the names of major characters , and change the content of the text in the titles and dialogue . When Hollywood silents were distributed in Europe , it was not unusual for the footage to be re-edited , with new titles inserted , altering the film's plot to suit the tastes of a different culture . This practice continued into the talkies era : for example , British prints of the Marx Brothers movie ' Horse Feathers ' contain a scene between Thelma Todd and Harpo which doesn't exist in any Stateside print I've seen . My detractors are looking at U . S . prints of these silents , while I'm usually screening European or British prints , which can be significantly different . ' Evangeliemandens liv ' ( " Evangelist's Life " ) begins very promisingly and imaginatively . We see popular Danish leading man Valdemar Psilander ( as himself ) sitting in a darkened set , reading a copy of this film's screenplay . Against a hazy background appear three images of John Redmond ( Psilander's role in this film ) in the three roles that he will fulfil in this story : playboy , convict , evangelist . It's a striking image , and a powerful opening scene . Too bad the film is downhill from here . Handsome young Billy Sanders ( Birger von Cotta-Schønberg ) is drifting into a life of crime , leading to quarrels with his girlfriend Nelly Gray ( Alma Hinding , a pretty brunette ) . Wise older man Redmond , now a lay preacher , proceeds to caution Billy by relating his own life story . Unfortunately , most of this movie's running time is taken up with Redmond's unwieldy flashback . Redmond ( looking no younger in the flashback ) was once a wealthy playboy , in love with the town slut ( Else Froehlich , quite sexy ) but jealous of her many other lovers . During an argument with one of these men , Redmond pulled a revolver and accidentally killed the woman they were fighting over . For this , Redmond served a long prison sentence ; while in Danish porridge , he found religion with the help of the prison chaplain ( Frederik Jacobsen , a dull performance ) . SPOILERS NOW . ' Evangeliemandens liv ' was a Danish film intended primarily for domestic audiences , so the ending released in Denmark would be the ' official ' ending . In that version , Billy sees the error of his ways , and he and Nelly are tearfully reunited while Redmond beams approval . However , this movie was released to foreign markets with two other endings . In the Russian version , Nelly decides to commit suicide . She fashions a noose ; in close-up , we see the arousal in her eyes as she embraces the noose lovingly . Then she hangs herself . The End . In the Swedish version , Nelly again fashions the noose ; again , she seems to arouse herself as she embraces it . She climbs onto a chair , kicks it away . . . just as Billy and Redmond burst into her room . Redmond unpockets a penknife , cuts the rope , tosses his knife aside while Billy helps Nelly onto the bed . Redmond raises his eyes heavenward , giving thanks that Nelly will live . I find these alternate endings interesting for what they reveal about the expectations of different film audiences . Apparently , Russian movie audiences in 1915 didn't want happy endings . Also apparently , Swedish audiences DID want happy endings . . . but only providing that the girl suffer first , and nearly kill herself . Also , I'm intrigued ( but not surprised ) that all three versions of this movie take a misogynist view : when a young couple quarrel over the boy's criminal propensities , it's clearly the duty of the girl - - not the boy - - to end the relationship by committing suicide . Oh , blimey ! ' Evangeliemandens liv ' is extremely well-photographed , and the prison sequences are quite realistic . Most of the actors give performances more subtle than I would have expected . But the pace of this film is leaden and stodgy , and the flashback structure is extremely unwieldy . My rating for this movie : , no matter which ending you see .
418373	1609079	21872	6.0	Face the camera , Gracie .	George Burns wants to buy a necktie ( hence this film's title ) but runs afoul of a shopgirl who speaks in extreme 1920s slang . ( He also meets a shopgirl with a very proper English accent . ) He claims to be the nephew of the store's owner , but this is clearly a ploy to get some service , as a moment later he asks who owns the store . A floorwalker cuts off the tie George is wearing so he can match it with one in stock . Just when things can't possibly get any screwier , George meets Gracie . . . ' Fit to Be Tied ' is a very crude comedy short : at one point , the camera adjusts itself during a shot . There's a reference to Elinor Glyn's steamy novel ' Three Weeks ' that will baffle modern viewers . But the byplay between George and Gracie is funny . Gracie Allen's speaking voice annoys me , but here - - singing ' I'm a Whole Lot Wilder Than I Know ' - - she reveals an excellent singing voice . Oddly , the director films her in three-quarter view during this sequence , rather than full-on . . . was Gracie perhaps worried that the monochrome film would reveal that her eyes were two different colours ? The first nine minutes of this 10-minute short are delightful , but the ending is weak . George and Gracie , having run out of material , simply face the camera and wave goodbye ! I'll rate this one .
418451	1609079	1059686	6.0	Nixon as King Arthur with some greasy Fryes .	I was living in Britain and Australia when ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' aired in the States , so I didn't have a chance to watch it regularly . I'm aware of the controversies which accompanied this programme , and which only make me that much keener to track down all the episodes . Despite the ' Comedy Hour ' title , this was actually a variety series featuring impressive guest performances by some major music acts across a wide range of musical styles and genres . This synopsis is specifically a review of the 18th episode of the 3rd series of ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' , one of the few episodes which I've seen . . . and a distinct letdown , compared to the much better 16th episode produced only a few weeks earlier . One strong point here is the performance of Bob Einstein - - the underrated brother of the overrated Albert Brooks - - in his recurring role as LAPD motorcycle cop Officer Judy , who was perpetually trying to arrest Tom Smothers on various ridiculous charges . Einstein consistently played this role with a deadpan face , a deep monotone voice and sunglasses which concealed his eyes . . . thus making it easier for him to keep a straight face during his often hilarious material . ( Bob Einstein usually wrote his own scripts , and is equally as underrated as a gag writer as he is as a performer . ) In this episode , Officer Judy tried to give a summons to guest star Liberace for driving his piano beyond the speed limit . To see if Liberace is drunk , Officer Judy orders him to blow into a balloon . Liberace complies , then shyly asks if he can keep the balloon . This episode also features what is apparently the only-ever television appearance by a folk-singing duo cried Hedge and Donna Capers : rather daringly for the time , they were also an interracial married couple . I usually despise the political impressionist David Frye , although I wish I'd been present during his legendary nightclub performance when Frye ( as Richard Nixon ) and Peter Cook ( posing as a BBC reporter ) ad-libbed an entire press conference . For this ' Smothers ' episode , guest star Liberace ( ! ) narrates a fairy-tale skit taking place in the Middle Ages . Frye appears on a balcony as an elderly bespectacled king who sounds like Lyndon Johnson . ( ' My fellow Amurricans , I come here tonight with a heavy head . ' ) The king has decided to retire ( surely ' abdicate ' is the word ? ) , and he wants his entire kingdom searched in a quest for a fitting successor . To conduct this quest , he chooses his minstrel Dick ( Smothers , singing " me-me-meeee ! " ) and his jester , Tom Fool ( Tommy Smothers , looking ridiculous in cap and bells ) . Liberace purrs his way through some unfunny narration - - " They searched high , and they searched low . And sometimes , they searched when they were feeling normal . " - - while Dick and Tom search the kingdom for LBJ's successor . They have an Excalibur-like sword in a stone , which only the man qualified to rule the kingdom will be able to draw forth . The first candidate is a knight with a southern drawl ( Frye again , channelling George Wallace ) . After some unfunny dialogue involving the word " pussy-footing " , Frye / Wallace attempts to draw the sword , and fails . The next candidate is one Sir H : Frye yet again , this time imitating Hubert Humphrey . He too fails . Inevitably , along comes a knight resembling Richard Nixon . ( No prizes for guessing that this too is Frye . ) I've always loathed Frye's depiction of Nixon , which seems to border on the pathological . Here , we get a very unfunny ending to the skit : Frye / Nixon is about to attempt to draw the sword , when Dick stops him from trying . . . while telling Tom Fool that this man MUST be crowned the new king because he's the only candidate left ! A crowd of peasants carry off the new ruler on their shoulders : Frye copies Nixon's victory gesture , then asks " Sock it to WHO ? " in Nixon's voice . This just isn't funny . If the cleverest thing the Smothers lads and Frye can come up with is to allege that Nixon only became President because there was nobody else available , then they really don't deserve to be considered political satirists . I'll give the Smothers siblings credit for being the ONLY prime-time act to attempt topical material at the time , but this sort of satire is very blunt indeed . My rating for this episode : just .
418946	1609079	217945	6.0	That everlasting wristwatch	Eleanor Bron's series ' Making Faces ' was ahead of its time ; although basically a sitcom , ' Making Faces ' was more concerned with offering an ongoing character study of its female protagonist , and in that regard the series anticipated later American programmes such as ' The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd ' and ' The New Adventures of Old Christine ' , as well as some of Tracey Ullmann's work . Unfortunately , the audience seemed to expect belly laughs , which were not on offer here . Bron had a well-deserved reputation for comedy at this point , prompting viewers to expect more of the same here . . . but the excellent scripts of ' Making Faces ' ( all written by Michael Frayn ) were more interested in letting her delineate and define a character rather than go for punchlines . Eleanor Bron played the same character - - the oddly named Zoya Hirst - - in all six episodes . The gimmick was that each episode took place in a different year , depicting Zoya at different stages in her life . . . always seeking romance and fulfilment , but never quite finding them . Each episode had a date in the title , to help viewers keep track of what year this was in Zoya's timeline . I saw this series when it was originally transmitted , and I should like to view it again . Although Bron wore a different hairstyle for each year , I distinctly remember that her character wore the same wristwatch in every single episode , taking place over the course of about a decade . Now that's value for money ! I'll rate ' Making Faces ' : the scripts weren't really very good , and Bron has done much better work elsewhere , but this programme deserves some credit for innovation .
418883	1609079	11263	6.0	Racist but funny anyway	' Haunted Spooks ' , starring Harold Lloyd , was midway through its shooting schedule when Lloyd suffered the bizarre accident which crippled him for life . As a publicity gag , he posed for a photo with a prop bomb of the classic ' bowling-ball ' style so popular among movie anarchists : the bomb's fuse was lit , and Harold held the bomb near his face so he could light his cigarette . By a fluke , somebody spoke to him and he lowered the bomb to reply . . . just before the ' prop ' bomb exploded . It was a real bomb , which somebody had ordered from a props agency to use for a picnic . ( Must have been quite a picnic ! ) When the bomb went unused , it was stupidly returned to inventory among some ' dud ' bombs which had been made as genuine props . If Lloyd hadn't lowered the bomb from his face , his movie career ( and his life ) would have ended right there . Lloyd lost the thumb and forefinger of his right hand ( he was right-handed ) and was temporarily blinded in his right eye . Production on ' Haunted Spooks ' was halted until he returned from hospital wearing a latex glove with a false thumb and finger ( moulded from a reverse casting of his left hand ) . The suicide sequences at the beginning of ' Haunted Spooks ' are the last footage of Lloyd with his intact right hand . The haunted-house sequences later in this movie ( and all of his subsequent films ) feature him with his prosthetic glove . It's amazing to realise that Lloyd performed the stunts in all of his ' thrill ' comedies ( including his climb up a skyscraper in ' Safety Last ' and his climb down another skyscraper in ' Feet First ' ) with a maimed hand . In the 1950s , Jack Benny ( unaware of Lloyd's handicap ) invited him to guest on Benny's TV show : Lloyd declined , as his latex prosthesis had long since rotted . SPOILERS FOR SOME OF THE GAGS . The opening sequence of ' Haunted Spooks ' is very funny . Lloyd plays a young man who has been disappointed in love , and is now determined to kill himself . Finding a pistol in the street , he shoots himself in the head but gets only a faceful of water : it was a squirt pistol . Deciding to jump off a bridge into a lake , he clambers over the rail , and is about to jump when suddenly a stranger intercedes . But the stranger only wants to know what time it is . Lloyd hands the fellow his watch and tells him to keep it . Then Lloyd jumps off the bridge . . . into a few inches of water . These gags are very funny on their own merit , but they have a morbid edge for viewers who are aware that Lloyd very soon would narrowly escape a real-life death . The second half of ' Haunted Spooks ' is much more contrived , and also extremely racist . I should warn you that the title of this movie is meant to be a racial pun : ' spooks ' being a 1920s slang term for Negroes . Lloyd has to spend the night in a creepy old house which , in Scooby-Doo fashion , is haunted by some fake ghosts . Lloyd gets rather frightened : there's one bizarre shot of Lloyd in a fright wig which stands out from his head like a 1970s Afro . Speaking of Afros : the haunted house is full of stereotypical black characters who ( of course ) are even more cowardly than Lloyd . There's one outrageous shot depicting a roomful of frightened blacks , all of them quivering in fear with their knees knocking in perfect unison . Yassuh ! The immensely talented black child actor Ernie Morrison ( who was usually billed as ' Sunshine Sammy ' ) provides one very funny gag among the racial stereotypes . Morrison was about seven years old at the time , and short with it . At one point in the haunted house , little Morrison falls into an adult-sized pair of trousers which are taller than he is . Instead of climbing out of the trousers , Morrison stumbles blindly about the house , with his legs in the trouser legs and the rest of his body inside the crutch of the trousers . This looks like a pair of trousers going walkies with nobody inside them . Of course , everybody who sees this immediately gets frightened . ' Haunted Spooks ' contains some fairly mean-spirited humour ( including its title ) at the expense of black people , but some of the gags are so inventive that I laughed anyway . . . and the opening suicide sequence is first-rate black comedy in the non-racial sense of the term . I'll rate this comedy .
418288	1609079	246482	6.0	Tell me , pretty maid . . .	' Chasing the Chaser ' , directed by Stan Laurel and co-written by Laurel with Charley Chase's brother James Parrott , was one of the comedy shorts that tried to promote James Finlayson as a star comedian . ' Fin ' , of course , would ultimately achieve success as an adversary to the greatest comedy team of all time . . . but he's quite good here , running a gamut of facial expressions in a haberdasher's shop . However , the stand-out performance in ' Chasing the Chaser ' has to be that of Jules Mendel , who offers an astonishing female impersonation . ( Mendel had done a femme act in vaudeville as Jewel Mendel . ) We first see Mendel in full female disguise , seated at a desk in a detective agency . ( Address : 714 Grief Building . ) Two lady clients enter . This being 1925 , a woman can't possibly be the person in charge , so they ask to see the head man : the secretary whips off ' her ' wig , revealing Mendel underneath . Unfortunately , the sequence is set up so that I had a clear view of Mendel's adam's-apple and shoulders , tipping the wink before he took off his wig . This is something I've never quite understood about female impersonations : when the alleged woman takes off her hair , revealing a shorter haircut underneath , we're supposed to realise that she's a man . But if the rest of the female disguise is good enough to avoid suspicion , then why doesn't removing the wig merely make her seem a short-haired woman ? Maybe the larger brow ridge and higher forehead on a man are the give-away . Anyroad , Helen Gilmore's husband ( Finlayson ) is a philanderer , so she and neighbour Marjorie Whiteis engage Mendel to show up at Finlayson's house ( disguised as a parlourmaid ) and flirt with him . Mendel's female disguise is almost perfect . . . but , stupidly , he fakes a feminine swoon into Finlayson's arms . Won't Fin notice that this ' woman ' is heavy enough to be a man ? Later , when the maid gets ' her ' skirt torn off , we see that male Mendel has concealed his family Jules inside female directoire undergarments . Now , that's really getting into a role ! But why doesn't Mendel's character wear kirby grips to keep his wig in place ? A scene featuring Fay Wray as a nursemaid with a pram distressed me , because Fay leaves her infant outside in the street while she's inside a shop . . . for an hour , the title cards tell us . I hope the kid's parents fired her . The two lead actresses should have swapped roles : Gilmore , as the wife , isn't nearly so funny as Whiteis , whose haughty performance here reminds me of the great Edna May Oliver . As a comedy , ' Chasing the Chaser ' is slightly above average : I'll rate it . This movie will probably be of much greater interest to students of cross-gender disguise for Jules Mindel's near-perfect impersonation of a pretty parlourmaid .
418556	1609079	19852	6.0	Snowballs	' Eternal Love ' stars John Barrymore in semi-swashbuckling mode with the beautiful Camilla Horn . This is one of those late silent films that were released with soundtracks consisting of music and sound effects . In ' Eternal Love ' , several gunshots are heard at climactic moments . . . but they're all pathetic little popgun sounds . Still , in 1929 any sound that emerged from the movie screen must have thrilled audiences . This film is directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch , though several of his other movies from this period are much better . The story begins in 1806 , when France and Austria are " at each other's throats " ( as a title card ludicrously claims ) , and the Swiss village of Pontresina is caught in the middle . The French military officers demand that all men in the village surrender their weapons . . . and all the men immediately do so ( I found this wildly implausible ) except for Marcus Paltram ( Barrymore ) , who is clearly supposed to be the only ' real man ' in the village . Marcus is in love with the beautiful blonde Ciglia ( Horn ) , who lives with her uncle the minister ( good performance from Hobart Bosworth ) . Marcus's bitter rival is Lorenz Gruber , played by Victor Varconi ( a handsome and talented silent-film actor who usually played unsympathetic roles ) . Marcus is pursued by Pia , a dark peasant girl whose desire for him is frankly carnal . After setting up an intriguing premise , with the peaceful Swiss villagers living under French military occupation , this is dropped by the second reel and never mentioned again . The villagers throw a masked ball , with surprisingly elaborate costumes and masks . With bludgeon-heavy symbolism , Pia's mask gives her the face of a crone , while Ciglia's mask depicts a woman's face with exaggerated beauty . After the ball , Marcus makes a drunken pass at Ciglia ; in a moment of anger , she spurns him . Marcus does the gentlemanly thing , and leaves . . . only to run into Pia , and they end up in his bed together . ( So that Barrymore's character remains sympathetic , the film clearly establishes that she seduces him , not the other way round . ) SPOILERS COMING . The film degenerates into soap opera . Pia's mother demands that Marcus marry Pia . This enables Lorenz to marry Ciglia . When he realises that she still loves Marcus , Lorenz tries to murder his rival . Eventually , Marcus and Ciglia flee into the Alps , where Ciglia prays to God to let the two of them die together . God obliges with a friendly avalanche . ( I really dislike films in which God takes an active hand in the proceedings : if that's the way the universe works , then why doesn't God do this more often ? ) ' Eternal Love ' features some splendid photography . Especially noteworthy in this movie ( filmed in California but set in Switzerland ) are some superb glass-shots to create the Swiss Alps in the background . An early sequence which allegedly takes place up in the mountains looks more like it was filmed in Bronson Canyon . . . in the same spot where they filmed ' Robot Monster ' . Barrymore is good in his role , but this is one of those movies in which every supporting male character is depicted as a spineless wimp so that the male lead is both the most macho character and the most principled character . ( I cringed during the scene in the tavern , when Barrymore helps himself to several other men's drinks . . . and not a man in the place has the guts to challenge him , not even in a group . ) Still , the good points in this film outweigh the bad . I'll rate ' Eternal Love ' . Yodel-lay-he-hoo !
418393	1609079	31325	6.0	Which way did he go , George ?	Douglas Corrigan was an early example of the ' 15 minutes of fame ' phenomenon . A working-class Texan from a family with strong Irish-American roots , Corrigan bought a junked aeroplane and fixed it to his own satisfaction - some parts literally held on with baling wire - and in 1938 he flew cross-country from California to New York , intending to do a Lindy and fly solo across the Atlantic to Ireland . In New York , flight officials refused to certify Corrigan's airborne jalopy as airworthy for the transatlantic flight , and he was ordered to turn round and fly back home . ( The certification standards were laxer for an overland flight , for reasons which I assume are obvious . ) Corrigan agreed to fly west from New York , and was cleared for take-off . Straight away he was in the air , Corrigan volte-faced as his ' plane did an about-turn and flew east . Several thousand miles later , when he landed , he affected to be greatly surprised that he was in Ireland rather than California . . . claiming that he had flown above cloud cover for the entire trip , and hadn't realised he was flying over ocean instead of land ! He also claimed that his instruments were defective ( I believe that part ) , so he'd thought he was flying west instead of east ! Corrigan was promptly nicknamed ' Wrong Way ' Corrigan by an affectionate public who knew damned well he was lying , but who admired his brass-bottle gumption . To this day , one continues to encounter the nickname ' Wrong Way Corrigan ' hung on anyone who proceeds in the wrong direction . ' The Flying Irishman ' is a quickie film , cashing in on Corrigan's exploit and starring himself in the lead role . A sizeable number of the supporting roles in this film are played by veteran character actors , which in this case is a disadvantage : we're supposed to see this film as a factual enactment of real events , but the presence of familiar faces Robert Armstrong , Paul Kelly , Donald MacBride , Charles Lane , Frank Faylen , & c , constantly remind us that we're watching a movie . Corrigan is no actor , so his interaction with these old pros is jarring . He does nicely enough in a brief scene with blonde Joyce Compton as a blowsy waitress . The film attempts to tell Corrigan's entire life story up to his wrong-way flight , depicting his early days and his relationship with his brother Henry . None of this material is very interesting , especially as it appears to be the usual Hollywood bio-pic confabulation . We're really here to see Corrigan's flight and what happened afterwards . Since I already knew Corrigan's story before I saw this film , there were no surprises for me here . When this movie was made , in 1939 , practically everyone in America knew Corrigan's story . . . so , my criticism on that point is valid . Still , modern viewers - who have heard of Corrigan but don't know anything about him - might enjoy watching this movie . Also , I admire Corrigan for his real-life nerve ( risking his life to prove he was right and the aviation officials were wrong ) . I admire him for breaking the rules in a context that jeopardised no-one but himself , and I admire him for getting away with it afterward . I wish that screenwriter Dalton Trumbo had spent more time writing movies like this , and less time in some of his other activities . ( Guess which ones , comrade . ) I'll rate this movie . Cleared for take-off !
419109	1609079	21400	6.0	dis-Oriented	' Son of the Gods ' , starring Richard Barthelmess , is a good example of how an actor's current performance is inflected by his ( or her ) previous performances . With the possible exception of " Tol'able David " , Barthelmess's best ( and best-known ) role was his performance as the gentle Chinese immigrant in ' Broken Blossoms ' . Barthelmess played that role with all the usual gimmicks employed by a white actor depicting an Oriental : sellotaped eyelids , cringing posture , the lot . Despite some racist and unpleasant ' Chinky ' dialogue , Barthelmess brought genuine dignity and realism to his performance as a Chinese in ' Broken Blossoms ' . Memories of his performance in that role must have helped considerably for the audience who watched Barthelmess in ' Son of the Gods ' during its original release . SPOILERS COMING . Barthelmess here plays Sam Lee , the son of a wealthy Chinese merchant . In this role Barthelmess's eyelids are normal , which the audience might interpret as simply the director's decision to avoid a ridiculous make-up job . At any rate , Barthelmess doesn't in any way look Chinese . There's an awkward scene in which Sam and his father begin to converse in Chinese but then lapse into English , clearly for our benefit . Sam embarks on a world tour , in which he meets wealthy socialite Allana Wagner , played by Constance Bennett . She's supposed to be very beautiful , but I'm still waiting . Allana is attracted to Sam , not realising that he's Chinese . ( He certainly doesn't look it , and his accent isn't Asian . ) They fall in love . Eventually , though , she learns the truth . This provokes an extremely unpleasant scene in which Allana strikes Sam in the face with a riding crop , while calling him a yellow dog , a cur , a liar , a cheat . Meanwhile , other people stand about watching her do this , without interceding . Later , Allana falls ill ( maybe from Chinese flu ? ) . While she's on her sickbed , her father ( Anders Randolf ) tells Sam that Allana is calling for him in her delirium . Wagner prevails on Sam to visit his daughter . Sam does this , and she recovers , but Wagner shows no gratitude . His attitude seems to be that Sam is just a filthy Chinese , so no gratitude is necessary . SPOILER NOW . And here's where it gets really offensive . It turns out that Sam isn't Chinese after all . A retired lawman informs Sam that he's a white foundling , adopted in infancy . He never knew he's actually white ! But now that Sam is safely Caucasian , Allana is perfectly willing to marry him . Even more strangely , Sam is eager to marry Allana after all . Is he a masochist ? There is a nasty tradition of films and plays in which a white woman is attracted to a dark-skinned man but is simultaneously repelled because he is the ' wrong ' colour . . . only to learn that in fact he's a white man after all , whose complexion is down to many years of being tanned by the sun . Examples of this offensive scenario include ' The Sheik ' ( Arab turns out to be white foundling ) and ' Whoopee ! ' ( Amerindian turns out to be white foundling ) . ' Son of the Gods ' is one more example of this dark genre . What makes it vaguely plausible is the fact that Barthelmess is best known for playing a ( genuine ) Chinese in a previous film , so we accept him as Chinese in ' Son of the Gods ' . In this film's favour , there is a moving scene in which - after learning the truth about his ancestry - Sam decides that he considers himself Chinese after all , as he was raised by Chinese within the Chinese culture after his ' own ' people abandoned him . Also , this film contains some very beautiful exterior scenes and some elaborate interiors . There's also a Technicolor sequence filmed in San Francisco's Chinatown . . . regrettably , this sequence was seriously deteriorated in the print which I viewed . Constance Bennett ( who never appealed to me ) is neither physically attractive nor sympathetic in a role that's apparently meant to be both . Her role in this film is a racial bigot , yet we're not expected to perceive her that way . Apparently , we're meant to find it perfectly reasonable that she would be attracted to this white man , then repelled by him when she discovers he's not white , then attracted to him again when she learns he's white after all . If I were going to rate this film on its political correctness quotient , it might barely merit a rating of . Setting aside the fact that this movie's story is extremely racist and extremely implausible both at the same go , there are substantial merits in its photography , art direction , Frank Lloyd's supervision , and in the performances of Barthelmess and several supporting actors ( but not Bennett ) . Trying to judge this film by the standards of its time , I'll rate ' Son of the Gods ' .
419170	1609079	724957	7.0	Sullivan's Beatles tribute with no Beatles .	Ed Sullivan and the Beatles had enjoyed a mutually profitable relationship ever since the Fab Four made their Stateside debut on Sullivan's TV show . Gradually , the Beatles tapered off their participation in Sullivan's shows , diminishing from live appearances to taped appearances to mere archive footage . This IMDb review is specifically for episode # 23 . 22 of Ed Sullivan's show , which represents his attempt at one more bite of the cherry ( or Apple ) , and one more attempt to squeeze some magic out of the Beatles name . This was a special " Beatles tribute " episode of Sullivan's show , but in fact the Beatles had no direct participation at all , and are seen merely in some archive concert footage . The acts that do appear in person here are pretty much Ed's usual bunch of cronies and favourites , doing Beatle-themed material . Peter Gennaro and a couple of dancers do a comedy dance routine to " Sergeant Pepper " , wearing band uniforms and fooling about with props such as a detonator . A more classical dance is provided by Edward Villella , doing a solo ballet routine to an instrumental version of " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " . If you watched this with the volume turned down , you'd never guess it was Beatles material : Villella's in excellent form , but he's doing just the usual classical ballet manoeuvres , with lots of athletically high leaps and entrechats . He makes no attempt to offer tribute to rock music here . The Muppets do a routine that's allegedly underwater , with one Muppet ( voiced by Jim Henson ) attempting to sing " In an Octopus's Garden " while a Muppet marionette ( voiced by Frank Oz ) keeps swimming past ( on strings ) to interrupt him with underwater puns such as " Are you a friend or anemone ? " . Finally , the Henson Muppet loses all patience and asks his tormentor : " Why are you doing this ? " , prompting the Oz Muppet to reply : " Oh , just for the halibut . " Boom-boom ! I was amazed that a pun on the word " hell " would make it onto Ed Sullivan's strait-laced show . Weirdest of all is Peggy Lee's turn . She stands stock-still onstage , speak-singing " Maxwell's Silver Hammer " . Onto the stage in sidelong gait come a pair of Peter Gennaro's dancers , covered in weird metallic canisters . When Miss Piggy . . . I mean , Miss Peggy Lee gets to the chorus , these two dancers whack themselves in their respective heads with little ball-pean hammers to get the " clang , clang ! " effect . Truly weird . Along come Steve and Eydie to do a medley of the very softest and most mainstream Beatles songs , with a couple of Vegas gags thrown in . While they're warbling " Michelle , Ma Belle " , Steve gets all Gallic on the French lyric , then he goes fortissimo on the line " I love you , I love you " so that Eydie can change the third " I love you " into " I HEARD you ! " and get a laugh from the studio audience . The problem is that , as performed here , this sounds like just one more Steve and Eydie easy listenin ' duet that would go over just fine in Vegas . In fact , all the performers here seem to be basically following their own blisses , rather than trying to bend their own talents to the unique sound of the Beatles . Which proves , I suppose , the universal appeal of the Fab Four . Or something . I wanna hold , you're bland . . . yeah yeah yeah .
418450	1609079	1053058	7.0	" A Paper of Pins " : Greer Garson guys herself .	I was living in Britain and Australia when ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' aired in the States , so I didn't have a chance to watch it regularly . I'm aware of the controversies which accompanied this programme , and which only make me that much keener to track down all the episodes . Despite the ' Comedy Hour ' title , this was actually a variety series featuring impressive guest performances by some major music acts across a wide range of musical styles and genres . This synopsis is specifically a review of the fifth episode of the 2nd series of ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' , one of the few episodes which I've seen . The musical guests in this episode are cried the Association . . . and where did they come up with THAT strange name ? I've heard several of the Association's performances ; I've never enjoyed their close-harmony arrangements , and I tend to dissociate myself from the Association . I can't even remember what song ( s ) they perform here , and that's no loss . ' Mister Patrick Leighton Paulsen ' ( as Dick Smothers introduces him ) does one of his usual unfunny ' editorials ' . I've never found Paulsen funny : he was a deeply angry man who didn't even bother memorising his material ; he relied heavily on cue cards , and towards the end of his life he got increasingly lazy at hiding this penchant . Far and away , the real delight of this episode is a rare guest appearance by the actress Greer Garson , still gorgeous and classy several years after her film career waned . She and Dick duet here on ' A Paper of Pins ' , a beautifully understated English folk-song . Just occasionally , the Smothers Brothers would put aside their political agenda to return to their roots as folk singers . . . by which I mean performers of authentic folk minstrelsy , rather than that hippy-dippy coffee-house stuff . Garson's singing voice is splendid here , and she's very beautiful . When Dick Smothers ( an underrated actor ) sings to her the song's simple lyric - - " I'll give to you a paper of pins , and that's the way my love begins " - - it's easy to imagine that he's genuinely courting her . There has long been a very nasty urban legend about Garson that I'd love to put to rest . Supposedly , when she won her Oscar for ' Mrs Miniver ' , Garson gave a very long boring acceptance speech . Here's the truth : shortly after Garson's Oscar win , gay actor Laird Cregar attended a gay party in Hollywood at which he performed a vicious parody of Garson , giving a long-winded and pompous parody of her speech . Somehow this came to be perceived as the fact . On the very rare occasions when Greer Garson ever discussed the incident , she made plain that she resented the inaccurate rumour . In light of the above , I was astounded by a comedy bit which Garson performs in this Smothers Brothers episode . In the second half of the show , the Smothers siblings and their resident repertory company ( without Garson ) perform a series of skits . Alternating with these , Garson stands at a podium and gives a very long-winded parody of her own Academy Award speech ! I found it deeply surprising that she would do this , since she must have realised that this skit would lend credence to the same rumour that she'd previously disavowed . Well , at least this shows that Garson could make fun of herself . What a classy lady ! My rating of this episode : , mostly for Garson's participation .
418470	1609079	841152	7.0	Edwardian striptease	Filmmakers realised very early on that sex appeal would bring in the customers . The movie camera enabled audiences to view a shapely actress in close-up , or at least much more closely than she could be seen from across the footlights of a stage . ' Pull Down the Curtain , Susie ' is a brief film offering sexual titillation . . . though of course by modern standards it's all quite innocent . There's only one camera set-up : an ostensible street scene , which is obviously a painted set of the sort often used by Georges Melies at this time . The biggest innovation here is that the actors - - one man and one woman - - are on two different levels : the man at street level , the woman on the first storey abovestairs . A man enters stage left , walking along the street . Behind him , we see two upstairs windows : both windows have shades , but the shades are up and we can clearly see a young lady undressing . The man sees her too : he pauses to watch as she peels off one layer after another of her nineteenth-century garments . Just when things are approaching the bare minimum , she suddenly realises she's being observed , and she coyly pulls down the shade . End of movie . This movie probably gave Grandpa palpitations . Despite the extremely phony appearance of the hand-painted ' street ' set , the clothes worn by the man and the woman ( including her undergarments ) are realistic and typical attire of their time . In addition to being mildly amusing for modern audiences , ' Pull Down the Curtain , Susie ' has some historic value for showing modern viewers what sort of undergarments were worn by women in Edwardian times , and how they were removed . I'll rate this movie .
418813	1609079	6813	7.0	Did Ernie Kovacs see this movie ?	Roscoe Arbuckle wrote , directed and starred in ' His Wife's Mistake ' at a crucial point in his career , when he was weaning himself off crude slapstick and gradually developing a subtle sense of characterisation . I enjoyed this entire two-reeler , except for one genuinely disgusting sequence after Roscoe's boob character gets shaving cream mixed up with vanilla ice cream . Unbilled actor Frank Hayes plays a barber's customer who gets lathered with the ice cream : when Hayes discovers the mistake , there's a truly sick-making scene when he and Arbuckle both start licking Hayes's face . ( Hayes , a stage-trained Victorian actor , uses his lanky frame to good effect here . ) Meanwhile , we see pretty Betty Gray sipping a shaving-cream soda . . . then spitting it out again . The plot is standard farce confusion . Roscoe is the porter and all-purpose dogsbody in an office building . Big-shot executive William Jefferson is expecting a client named Stout , and orders his wife ( Minta Durfee ) to detain Stout until a crucial moment . When blimp-bodied Roscoe blunders into the reception room , Minta asks him ' Are you Stout ? ' . From here , the movie writes itself . I was slightly surprised by the arrival of a ' nance ' character named Percy Dovewing , played by Arthur Earle . Actually , ' nance ' characters ( effeminate males ) were stock comedy characters long before 1916 , but this character still astonished me . For one thing , his name is nearly identical to that of Percy Dovetonsils , the effeminate poet played so memorably on television by Ernie Kovacs four decades on . Arbuckle and Kovacs were both comedy geniuses , yet Kovacs's humour shows no obvious influence from Arbuckle . ' His Wife's Mistake ' makes me wonder if Kovacs perhaps studied Arbuckle's films . Earle's performance as Dovewing is a fairly standard ' nance ' act , except for one startling moment immediately after his entrance , when he crosses paths with a Negro . At this point I groaned , expecting to see two stereotypes at the same go : stereotypical gay man meets stereotypical black man . I was surprised by what happened instead . The black man ( unbilled , and apparently not a professional actor ) stares at Dovewing , then laughs and does a brief ' camp ' imitation of him ! It's refreshing to see a 1916 movie in which a black man acts like a normal human being instead of a goggle-eyed lawn ornament . I viewed a print of ' His Wife's Mistake ' which appears to have a truncated ending . Several of the Triangle-Keystones were conceived as three-reelers but released more economically as two-reelers ; I suspect that footage was excised from this film before its release , in which case the missing footage likely no longer exists . Basically , Roscoe has screwed up the business deal but can just barely put it right in the last few seconds before a stock option expires . . . except that the characters here are so unsympathetic , there's no reason for us to want Roscoe to save them . I guess we'll never know how this movie was meant to end . But it's mostly funny on the way there . Despite that really disgusting ice-cream scene , I'll rate this comedy .
419131	1609079	148292	7.0	Simultaneous magpies .	' Hitch Hikers ' is an above-average Heckle and Jeckle cartoon . The two magpies are thumbing a ride ( magpies have thumbs ? ) without success . Eventually , they force their way into a passing car . However , the car's canine occupants are a couple of bank robbers , heading for their hideout . Magpie mayhem ensues . Fortunately , most of it is quite funny . The opening sequence of this cartoon is visually rather odd . Heckle and Jeckle were usually drawn as lookalikes but they typically moved separately . In the first scene of ' Hitch Hikers ' , oddly , they stand side by side in the same position , and they perform the same movements identically and simultaneously . . . as if they were Thompson and Thomson out of ' Tintin ' . If this cartoon had been made a few years later , I would have assumed that the cel images in this animation sequence had been photocopied . Since this cartoon was made in 1947 , the animators must have used some other technique . At all events , it was a strange decision to make . . . the simultaneous movements of the magpies are off-putting rather than funny , and I doubt that the animators saved any money or labour with this process . My rating for this one : just .
419655	1609079	23033	7.0	This joint is jumping	" How've You Bean ? " is one of the six short Vitaphone comedies which comprise Roscoe Arbuckle's entire sound-film career . Arbuckle's sudden death occurred less than a week before this film was released . It's not the funniest of Arbuckle's talkies ( that's " Buzzin ' Around " ) , but it's not the worst of them either ( that would be " Tomalio " ) . Roscoe attends a fancy dinner party , where he accidentally spills some Mexican jumping beans into the food . ( Some amusing animation makes the beans appear to jump . ) Nobody notices the Mexican jumping beans when they eat the food , but soon all the hoity-toity rich folk are hopping up and down , and they don't know why . This is the closest Roscoe Arbuckle ever got to Three Stooges humour . ( And I'm a Stooges fan . ) Although Arbuckle is nominally the star of this short , he is teamed with a much shorter comedian ( Fritz Hubert ) who seems to be playing the Stan to Arbuckle's Ollie . " How've You Bean ? " is a silly comedy , completely implausible but still pretty funny . I'll give it . I shudder to think what Mel Brooks would do with this script . ( Let's see , now : Everybody at a party eats lots of beans , and then they all start to . . . no , never mind ! )
418205	1609079	461713	7.0	Impressive but outdated .	Lee Blessing's two-hander ' A Walk in the Woods ' is fiction , but based on a true incident from the last years of the Cold War . During the 1982 Geneva peace negotiations , American delegate Paul Nitze would occasionally stroll through the nearby forest between negotiation sessions . During one of these walks , he encountered Yuli Kvitsinsky , a member of the Soviet delegation . ( I'm slightly surprised that these men were able to meet surreptitiously , without security agents from both sides tailing them . ) In an informal setting away from bureaucratic protocol , these two men of good will were able to discuss nuclear brinkmanship ( and possible solutions ) far more honestly than they were able to do at the negotiating table . Before viewing this television production , I first saw ' A Walk in the Woods ' onstage at the Booth Theatre in New York City . The theatre was filled with rich American liberals who were clearly hostile to their own nation's government , and receptive to the Soviet viewpoint . ( So why don't they move there , then ? ) Nearly every line spoken by Botvinnik ( the fictional Russian character ) received laughter or applause , while Honeyman ( the American character ) clearly had an uphill battle to engage the audience's sympathies . Why does this foolish American insist on protecting his nation's interests ? Doesn't he realise that , in order to attain international peace , America must drop its defences and trust the Soviets ? On the other hand , the wise old Soviet delegate is absolutely right to keep his guard up and protect his own nation's interests : that's his job , after all . I seethed in rage as the above double standard unfolded on the stage in front of me , to the smug approval of the audience all round me . My memories of the stage play were so painful that I almost didn't watch this television version . In the event , I'm glad that I did . Here is the same Broadway cast ( Prosky and Waterston , both excellent ) , but with a different director . . . and the television format enables me to watch the drama in solitude , without wallowing in the limousine-liberal pieties of a Broadway audience . It was almost an entirely new show ! As performed here , the two roles are more evenly balanced than in the stage version , with Sam Waterston's protagonist sharing our sympathy . The fictional John Honeyman , to his credit , is obsessed with obtaining international peace . His Soviet counterpart is more interested in details of American culture ( such as Willie Nelson ) and eyedrops for his own medical condition . Andrey Botvinnik isn't worried : he realises that his job as a Soviet bureaucrat is a lifetime sinecure , whereas Honeyman is in danger of losing his job with the next U . S . election . After comparing the stage and tele-productions , I now wonder if perhaps Lee Blessing did intentionally skew our sympathies towards the Russian character . In the real-life situation which inspired this play , Paul Nitze was significantly older than Yuli Kvitsinsky : wiser , more experienced in diplomacy . Blessing has intentionally reversed the characters ' ages , making the Russian the calmer and cooler diplomat , and the American impetuous and excitable . In real life , I'm pleased that the United States won the Cold War . ' A Walk in the Woods ' is enjoyable and well-staged , but it can only be regarded as a period piece . Events have overtaken this play : now , we have less cause to worry about the Soviet bloc , and far more cause to worry about Jihadists who lurk in the dark . May America prevail against that madness . I'll rate ' A Walk in the Woods ' .
419429	1609079	16854	7.0	Can you Adam and Eve it ?	' Fig Leaves ' is a clever marital comedy , starring the rugged George O'Brien and the very sensual Olive Borden . In the prologue , they play Adam and Eve , got up in caveman cozzies . They've been invited to a fight between Cain and Abel , but Eve demurs . ' How can I go , Adam ? ' she asks her husband . ' I've nothing to wear ! ' Fade in 6 , 000 years later . ( That's the film's chronology , not mine . ) O'Brien and Borden are now a modern prole couple , plumber Adam Smith ( shouldn't he be an economist ? ) and his wife Eve . Their home is not the Garden of Eden , but a walk-up flat . The neighbour across the hall is Alice Atkins , whom an intertitle identifies as the modern serpent in Adam's and Eve's paradise . To stir up trouble , Alice suggests to Eve that she should get her husband to buy her some new clothes . Eve wants a new hat , but Adam tells her he can't afford it . Through a series of contrived events , Eve lands up getting a job as a model for couturier André ( a very swishy performance by the hilarious André de Beranger ) . He gets her pinned up in an outfit which I found very impressive : it manages to be fussily elaborate ( providing a running sight gag ) while at the same go it's spare enough to reveal ample portions of Olive Borden's delightful physique . A title card admits the contradiction : ' With some women , clothes are next to godliness . And with others , next to nothing . ' SPOILERS COMING . Adam has had a change of heart . He decides to buy his wife a fur coat from the poshest boutique in town . He walks into André's emporium , and is scandalised when he discovers that the half-naked mannequin is his own wife . They quarrel , but of course they make up . Adam offers to take his wife to a show . This time , we know what her reply will be : ' I've got nothing to wear ! ' ' Fig Leaves ' is bright and cheeky , and Olive Borden is always a pleasure to look at . Heinie Conklin supplies splendid low comedy as O'Brien's assistant ( a plumber's helper ) . I'll rate this pleasant froth .
418568	1609079	461568	7.0	Beware of German robots !	Wow ! I saw ' Rivals ' last month at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone , Italy ; they screened a print from the Bundesarchiv in Berlin . ' Rivals ' is the work of Harry Piel , a semi-handsome German who wrote and directed movies as star vehicles for himself , usually playing a dashing action hero . In ' Rivals ' , to make sure we remember the name of the actor cast in the lead role ( Harry Piel ) , the hero is named Harry Peel . So that's sorted , then . Since I write science-fiction stories myself , I'm very intrigued that many of Piel's films are early examples of science-fiction cinema , with a strong emphasis on gadgetry as well as thrills . ' Rivals ' has very much the feel of an American sci-fi movie serial . This is all by the numbers . Professor Ravello ( Adolf Klein ) is the brilliant but evil scientist who aspires to ( dare I say it ? ) rule the world . He also schemes to seduce and traduce the fair Evelyn ( Inge Helgard ) . Ravello is assisted by his robot , which looks like a German cousin of the Tin Woodman . ( The robot is identified as an ' automaton ' in the title cards . ) Even though this is a silent movie , I could hear the robot clanking . There's obviously an actor ( or a stuntman ) inside that galvanised robot costume , but please don't ask me who plays the robot : I didn't see a performer's name listed in the credits . Harry Peel ( Piel ) , of course , is our intrepid hero who risks his own life and limbs to foil Ravello and the robot and rescue Evelyn . Along the way , there are no end of ' Perils of Pauline ' adventures designed more for thrills than for logic . Piel ( or Peel ) seems to be auditioning for Houdini's job here ; he constantly escapes from Ravello's nefarious traps , including at one point an underwater cage made of glass ( ! ) . We get the usual lapses of logic . Ravello repeatedly captures Peel , but - - rather than simply killing him - - chucks him into some Heath Robinson contraption which is meant to kill Peel slowly and painfully , but merely gives actor Piel yet one more opportunity to stage an elaborate escape . Some of the stunts here are very obviously faked , but others are impressively real . At one point , a car drives off a bridge into a river . . . and doesn't come up again . This sequence is clearly genuine , and is better for the obvious lack of trickery . I've never been a huge fan of cliffhanger serials , since I tend to get hung up over the gaps in their logic rather than mindlessly enjoying the stunts . ' Rivals ' has the same problem as those serials : it's a thrilling adventure if you're willing to forget common sense and plausibility , but not otherwise . My rating for this one : .
418764	1609079	21296	7.0	The song of Roland has no Love for Montagu	Pearl White is the best-known silent-serial star , but Ruth Roland deserves to be remembered too . I find the dark-haired Ruth sexier than the fair-haired Pearl , and Ruth Roland's serials tended to be slightly more plausible than Pearl's . Some of Ruth Roland's silent serials even featured the intriguing device of captions and dialogue superimposed ( in white letters ) upon black objects on-screen in the frame compositions during the movie's action , so that there was no need to interrupt the action with inter-titles . Whereas Pearl White's screen career ended in 1924 , Ruth Roland continued to make films into the talkie era , revealing a pleasant voice for speaking and - - here in ' Reno ' - - for singing . Sadly , her screen career had lost momentum even before the cancer that prematurely killed her . SYNOPSIS : Society matron Felicia Brett ( Roland ) is unhappily married ; she and her husband Alexander have a young son , whom Felicia dearly loves . When it becomes clear that her marriage cannot be saved , Felicia heads for the divorce mecca in Nevada . . . but she's determined to retain custody of her son . One of the deepest flaws in this film is the performance of Montagu Love as Felicia's husband . On an earlier occasion , drama critic Heywood Broun described Love's acting technique as follows : ' He thrusts out his chest and then follows it across the stage . ' In ' Reno ' , Montagu Love plays all his scenes in Snidely Whiplash mode . When Alexander Brett contests his wife's attempts to gain custody of their son , Montagu Love's scenery-chewing makes it clear that Brett is motivated by sheer spite rather than love for the child . It helps a bit that young Bobby Brett is played by a child actor who's actually less twee and more talented than usual . SPOILERS COMING . Before Felicia has lived in Reno long enough to qualify for the residency status that will enable her to divorce Alexander , he contrives a situation in which she appears to be committing adultery with Dick Belden , her friend from childhood . Using this falsified evidence , Alexander Brett proceeds to take sole custody of Bobby . But then a convenient avalanche kills Brett . As the divorce was not yet final , Felicia is now Brett's widow - - not his ex-wife - - and she's free to marry Belden . Ruth Roland acquits herself well here , projecting grace and dignity and some sex appeal . Her speaking voice records well , and she has a musical number - - ' As Long As We're Together ' - - which she sings splendidly , although the song itself is insipid . Despite her premature death , I'm surprised that she didn't have a better career in early talkies . On the strength of Ruth Roland's performance ( and a few supporting performances ) rather than any merits in the turgid script , I'll rate ' Reno ' .
419299	1609079	24679	7.0	Did the Joker follow the Ace of Spades ?	SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' is one of those wildly implausible movies from Hollywood's studio era which still manage to be hugely enjoyable on the strength of sheer audacity and some colourful performances . Here we have that old chestnut : the serial murderer who announces his crimes in advance , in a highly theatrical manner , yet repeatedly kills his victims without getting caught . We also have that even mouldier chestnut : the amateur sleuth who is able to outwit the cops and nab the baddie . In this case , the murderer proclaims his intentions in advance by delivering to each victim an ace of spades ( the death card ) , with a neatly-written message announcing the hour at which he intends to do the deed . Naturally , he consistently manages to kill his victims ( and get away clean , his identity a secret ) even though they've been well and fairly warned . As the killer neglects to leave his name in the guest-book , he is cried the Ace of Spades . He murders wealthy art dealer Asa Marsden , and here we get another old-movie cliché : the murder shown from the killer's viewpoint . We see the victim goggling into the camera as the killer carks him , but the murderer is unseen . Next , the Ace of Spades announces his intention to murder wealthy Thornton Drake ' tomorrow at seven ' . ( Presumably this is P . M . , not A . M . . . . surely even serial murderers shouldn't have to get up early . ) At the fatal hour , the deed is done aboard an aeroplane in flight . At the stroke of seven , the lights go out in the passenger cabin . . . then they switch on again , and there's a corpse on the deckplates , stabbed through the heart . But the dead man isn't Drake : it's his secretary Austin Winters . Afterwards , the pilot claims to know nothing . The official detectives in this movie are played by two of my favourite character actors : Frank McHugh and the superb Allen Jenkins . Here they play characters named Clancy and Dugan , which gives you some idea of what to expect . Unfortunately , both actors perform their sleuth roles as comedy relief , which I found regrettable : the murders in this movie are played straight , so the seriousness of the homicides is undercut by the intentional comedy of the detectives trying to catch the killer . Screenwriter Ralph Spence often combined straightforward chills and broad comedy in his scripts - - notably in his play ' The Gorilla ' - - but here the mixture isn't as smooth as usual . The hero of this film is played by Chester Morris , so it's obvious who will solve the crime . For some reason , a lot of Hollywood whodunnits of the 1930s and ' 40s featured amateur detectives . Here , Morris plays a mystery novelist ( oh , boy ) who is researching the criminal career of the Ace of Spades as material for his next book . Morris decides that it might make a nice finish for his book if he actually catches the murderer . Along with this film's other merits , there's the Batman factor . It's well known that Batman's greatest villain the Joker ( created in 1939 ) was inspired by the character played by Conrad Veidt in ' The Man Who Laughs ' . But the premise of ' Tomorrow at Seven ' strongly resembles the premise of the Joker's debut story , and this 1933 movie may have supplied some inspiration to Batman's scriptwriter Bill Finger . ' Tomorrow at Seven ' has a lot of the little touches that make 1930s B-movies so enjoyable . Unfortunately , this movie also has a couple of the little touches so typical of that time which are very much less enjoyable . Here , we get a mercifully brief turn by African-American actor Gus Robinson in a ' yassuh ! ' role . I don't blame Robinson , whose options as a black actor in 1930s Hollywood must have been limited . I'll rate this otherwise enjoyable movie .
418800	1609079	36919	8.0	Pretty maids all in a row ? Well , Grace and Marcy , at least .	In Frank Sinatra's first three films , he was purely a speciality act : ostensibly playing himself , he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie . In his fourth film , the very enjoyable ' Higher and Higher ' , Young Blue Eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role . . . a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers . Sinatra's entrance is quite funny . Michele Morgan hears a knock at the door , and asks who's there . From outside , a Hoboken-toned voice answers ' Frank Sinatra ' . Sure enough . . . The opening credits of ' Higher and Higher ' may confuse some viewers , as the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are prominently displayed . In fact , they only contributed one song to this musical : ' Disgustingly Rich ' , which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song , ' I'm a Debutante ' . Interestingly , that Rodgers & Hart song - - one of their weakest - - is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score ; several others are lively up-tempo numbers , notably ' It's a Most Important Affair ' , ' When It Comes to Love , You're On Your Own ' and ' I Saw You First ' . Sinatra's good in this movie , but he would do better work ( and sing better material ) elsewhere . The real merits of ' Higher and Higher ' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films . Paul and Grace Hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several Broadway revues : genuinely graceful ballroom dancers , they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material . ( Here , Grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of Paul's hands . ) Grace Hartman , who died of cancer at age 48 , did almost no film work , so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up , to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform . After Grace Hartman's death , her husband had a long career as a character actor , just occasionally dancing solo . ( Or alongside Ken Berry in one memorable episode of ' Mayberry RFD ' . ) Also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in ' Higher and Higher ' is the vivacious teenage singer Marcy McGuire . Why didn't this talented girl make more movies ? Perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to Betty Hutton . I enjoy Hutton's performances but I like Marcy McGuire even better . Near the end of ' Higher and Higher ' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring McGuire and Mary Wickes as waitresses , taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub . The alternating strides of short McGuire and tall gawky Wickes are hilarious ! Regrettably , although Leon Errol plays a large role in ' Higher and Higher ' , he is given almost no comedy business : not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance . Jack Haley , despite his prominent billing , is also wasted . Very well-represented here is Dooley Wilson , inevitably remembered as Sam from ' Casablanca ' . In that film , Wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of ' As Time Goes By ' . ( In real life , Wilson couldn't play piano . ) Here in ' Higher and Higher ' , he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players . Less enjoyable is Mel Odious , I mean Mel Torme . Victor Borge gives a rare film performance here , handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows . The plot ? Forget it . ' Higher and Higher ' is nobody's idea of a ' great ' musical , but it's an enjoyable delight , and I'll rate it . Director Tim Whelan , who worked in Britain as well as in Hollywood , deserves to be much better known .
419632	1609079	251	8.0	The very first stop-action animation .	I viewed a print of this short film in the archives of the British Film Institute . ' Matches : An Appeal ' is the earliest known example of stop-animation , or indeed any form of movie animation . It is therefore of vital historic importance despite its crudity . The very brief film shows a stick-figure made of matchsticks , who climbs a stepladder to swab a paintbrush against a wall . In a technique that probably looked extremely unconvincing even to contemporary audiences , words form on the wall , presumably painted by the match-man . The message reads : ' For one guinea Messrs Bryant & May will forward a case containing sufficient to supply a box of matches to each man in a battalion with the name of the sender inside ' . As the film is dated 1899 ( when matches were still comparatively expensive items ) , presumably the battalions are British troops serving in the Boer War . However , I spoke with a curator at BFI who absolutely asserts that this film was made in the early 20th century and accordingly refers to the Great War . As I viewed an acetate dupe print rather than the original footage , I shan't offer any opinion as to this film's provenance . By modern standards , this film is almost laughably crude . But its historical significance is undeniable . I'll rate this very short film .
418521	1609079	17836	8.0	Long-lost Laurel & Hardy hilarity	Besides being very funny , the silent film ' Duck Soup ' is a vitally important link in the evolution of Laurel and Hardy as a comedy team . This movie was based on a music-hall sketch written by Stan Laurel's father , Arthur Jefferson , a successful theatre manager in northern England who resented his son's attempts to become a stage comedian . Laurel and Hardy made ' Duck Soup ' at a point when they were already established as a team but were still developing the ' Stan ' and ' Oliie ' characters that would soon become so popular and beloved . By this time , Oliver Hardy had already got his fastidious little moustache , but in ' Duck Soup ' he also has a considerable amount of beard stubble which makes him look quite jowly . ' Duck Soup ' was remade only three years later as ' Another Fine Mess ' . ' Duck Soup ' was a lost film for more than 50 years : in the early 1980s , a print turned up in Belgium . The original silent-film intertitles had been cut out and replaced with French titles . Also , one insert shot of a newspaper article had been cut out and a French translation spliced in . The prints which are currently available feature English-language titles which are blatantly translations of the French titles , and this brings a jarring touch : Laurel keeps addressing Hardy as ' sir ' , which doesn't really fit the relationship between their characters . The missing shot of the newspaper article has been replaced ( in 1982 ) with a modern mock-up , and this provides an unintentional laugh . While Hardy reads the newspaper article in 1927 , we can see the article directly underneath it . . . which is all about John DeLorean getting arrested for financial misdeeds in 1982 ! Oo-er ! In ' Duck Soup ' , Laurel and Hardy are tramps who discover that a local forest fire has made things hot for them : forest rangers are conscripting all the local indigent men for firefighting duty . Fleeing from the rangers , the two pals end up sharing a bicycle at the top of a steep hill , with disastrously funny results . Still hiding from the rangers , they end up inside the swank house of Colonel Blood , who is currently away . . . but Lord and Lady Plumtree have arrived to rent the house in the colonel's absence . Hardy disguises himself as the colonel , pressing Laurel into service to masquerade as the maid ! Stan Laurel was a gifted female impersonator : one of the very few male performers who could convincingly portray a woman and be funny at the same time . His drag turn as the maid here is astonishing and funny . The ending of this movie is quite different from the ending of the remake ' Another Fine Mess ' . Laurel and Hardy would occasionally end a film with an impossible gag , and they use one here . Is Laurel and Hardy's " Duck Soup " any relation to the Marx Brothers ' movie " Duck Soup : " ? Yes , indeed ! Leo McCarey was an assistant director on this movie . Six years later , when he directed the Marxes in what would become their greatest and funniest film , McCarey decided to recycle the title from this earlier film . The talkie revolution had changed Hollywood so utterly that silent movies made only a few years earlier were regarded as obsolete and unfit for re-release . . . so McCarey figured he had a free hand to re-use the title , and this silent movie vanished into oblivion for more than half a century . Fortunately , ' Duck Soup ' is now available again , and it's very funny . I'll rate this movie .
418709	1609079	25646	8.0	Pass the borscht , comrade .	( My thanks to Steven P Hill , University of Illinois , for helping me sort out the mukluks from the Muscovites in this confusing movie , the credits of which are in a barely legible Cyrillic typeface . The opinions which follow are entirely my own . ) I usually despise Soviet propaganda movies , and that's only partly because I despise communists . I despise Nazis too , but most of the propaganda movies made by the Third Reich were skilfully done , subtly invoking heroic figures from the past ( such as Friedrich Schiller ) rather than shilling explicitly for Hitler or the swastika . ( ' Triumph of the Will ' and ' Jew Suss ' were not typical . ) In comparison , most of the Soviet agitprop movies I've encountered are very crude propaganda indeed , employing all the subtlety of the bludgeon and the cudgel . This movie , ' Song of Good Fortune ' , is one of the very few well-made Soviet propaganda movies I've ever seen . If someone totally ignorant of communism's bloody history saw this film , they would probably believe that Stalinist collectivism is a very good thing indeed . I was especially impressed with the film's use of flashback to establish the hero's backstory . Mikhail Viktorov plays a young hermit who lives in the forest , playing his wooden flute like Papageno in ' Die Zauberflote ' . This young flautist crosses paths with a petty crook ( Boris Tenin ) who wonders why Viktorov lives in the woods . In flashback , we learn that Viktorov worked for a kulak ( a bourgeois land-owner ) , but got into a fight that caused the kulak to fall into the river , presumed drowned . ( Nikolai Michurin gives a good performance in his brief role as the kulak . ) Viktorov was forced to abandon his girlfriend ( Yanina Zheymo ) when he fled to escape punishment for the kulak's death . I found it unlikely that Viktorov's character would confide this to someone he's just met , but Viktorov's performance makes his character seem genuinely guileless . Tenin persuades Viktorov to accompany him to a high-street market , where Viktorov is wrongly arrested for theft . Now we see him in a Soviet prison , I mean re-education centre . Our hero has much to learn , comrade . The October Revolution transpired while Viktorov was living in the woods . . . so now killing a kulak is a revolutionary act , not a homicide . When Viktorov tootles his flute for his fellow inmates , the prison governor recognises his talent and summons a music professor ( Vladimir Gardin ) who can tutor the tooter to toot sweetly toot-sweet . As fast as the projectionist can change reels ( and credibility is reeling too ) , Viktorov becomes a good Soviet comrade , using his musical talent for the greater good of the collective . And his former girlfriend is still keeping a candle burning in her tractor for her tooter suitor . Pass the borscht , and I'll have mine with vodka . The prison in this Soviet movie is a bright airy place where all the inmates are treated with sympathy and understanding . Somehow , I doubt that the Lubyanka ( or any other prison in the real Soviet Union ) had this much sweetness and light . The exterior sequences in this movie are beautifully photographed , and the actors give better performances than usual for a Russian movie . I'm well aware that everything done here is in aid of the single most monstrous regime in human history , even worse than the Nazis . . . but this movie does very well what it set out to do . I'll rate ' Song of Good Fortune ' . Back to the salt mines , tovarich !
419240	1609079	14679	8.0	Sheikh hands with the devil .	There were two different film figures named Rex Ingram : interestingly , the English director Michael Powell worked with both of them . One of the two Rex Ingrams was an African-American actor who appeared in both film versions of ' The Thief of Bagdad ' . The other Rex Ingram was an Irish-born director who set up an independent film studio in France after establishing himself in Hollywood as a highly innovative auteur with a unique visual sense . Sadly , after proving himself one of the most distinctive visual stylists of the silent-film era , Ingram's career petered out rapidly with the coming of sound . It is this Rex Ingram - - not the black American actor - - whom fellow Irishman James Joyce praised in ' Finnegans Wake ' . It may well be that the director ' borrowed ' his name from the black actor : ironically , the director's real name was Hitchcock . . . perhaps he thought that nobody could be a successful film director with a name like Hitchcock ! ( All further references to ' Rex Ingram ' in this review apply to the Irish director , not the American actor . ) Throughout his career , Ingram showed a penchant for the exotic , but in later years he became increasingly interested in the culture and religion of Arab lands . The interest was sincere , apparently , as Ingram eventually converted to Islam . His film ' The Arab ' was based on an existing play , yet this movie appears to be a project which Ingram initiated , and which was deeply personal for him , as opposed to some studio assignment . I viewed an archive print of ' The Arab ' which had its original titles cut out and Russian translations spliced in . Fortunately , a Russian curator ( who wanted to see the film herself ) screened it with me and offered verbal translations of some of the titles . This review is based on the film's visual images and a second-hand version of the title cards . ( Why won't IMDb allow me to post ' intertitles ' as one word - - the proper term - - instead of breaking it up into two words ? ) CONTAINS SPOILERS . The setting is Syria , during a war with Turkey . ( I make no claims for the historical accuracy of this movie . ) Jamil is a soldier in the Bedouin defence forces , but he has deserted his regiment . In a remote village , he encounters an orphan asylum run by American missionaries : Mary Hilbert and her father . Jamil and Mary feel a mutual attraction . Meanwhile , the Turks are on their way to pillage the village . The leader of the villagers is identified in the Russian title cards as ' the Governor ' , but surely ' the Mayor ' is more accurate . The Governor ( sic ) , eager to placate the oncoming Turks , arranges for the children in the orphanage to be ' evacuated ' to Damascus for their safety : actually , he intends to hand them over to the Turkish invaders , knowing that the children will be slaughtered . Jamil is modest and self-effacing . Mary is a Christian and Jamil is ( at the moment ) a Moslem , yet he casually admits to her that he has been a Christian several times and will probably be one again . It seems that his convictions change as easily as the desert winds . But now some of Jamil's fellow Bedouins arrive . Will they shoot him as a deserter ? No . It turns out that Jamil is the son of the ruling sheikh . ( He was too modest to mention this . ) And it also turns out that Jamil's father has died , so now Jamil is the new sheikh . As soon as he assumes this mantle ( or burnoose ) , Jamil suddenly gains a sense of responsibility . He risks his own life to save the children , repel the Turks , and overthrow the corrupt Governor . Naturally , sweet Mary gets a case of the hots for him . There is an exciting climax . Earlier scenes in the film hinted that the passion between Mary and Jamil is doomed to failure , due to their differing cultures and faiths . But now Mary - - who has devoted her entire life to Christian works - - starts dropping hints that she might convert to Islam . Why not just let Jamil convert one more time , as he's had more experience at it ? Much of this movie is deeply implausible , but Ingram directs it with a panache and visual flair that make the film exhilarating even while we don't believe a word of it . One assumes that he brought his personal beliefs to this project . In the lead role , Ramon Novarro takes the bold step of playing Jamil as a protagonist who must earn our sympathy and respect , rather than having them from the start . Alice Terry ( Ingram's wife , and his leading lady in many of his films ) is far less effective in her portrayal of the young Christian missionary . She is quite beautiful and photogenic , but Terry's good looks actually work against her in this role : would a missionary in a remote location devote quite so much time to her hair and make-up ? I'm rating this very entertaining movie , but I may be overrating it slightly to compensate for the fact that I saw it in difficult circumstances .
418867	1609079	351241	8.0	Skewed version of penny-dreadful true murder case .	This afternoon at the Barbican , I attended a screening of ' The Life Story of John Lee : The Man They Could Not Hang ' , with excellent live piano accompaniment by John Sweeney , as part of the opening day's programme for the Silent Film & Live Music Series running through June . This fascinating true-crime film was shown today on a double-bill with a digital restoration of ' The Story of the Kelly Gang ' ( 1906 ) , generally believed to be the first feature-length movie . The bizarre story of John Lee was once well-known fodder for the penny-dreadfuls , but has now sunk to the level of ' Believe it or not ' lore . On 15 November 1884 , an elderly woman named Emma Keyse was found dead in her cottage in South Devon , clearly a homicide . The house had been fired deliberately . Yet Keyse's possessions appeared to be untouched ; apparently the killer's motive was something other than robbery . The police promptly arrested 20-year-old John Lee , who had occasionally worked for Keyse . His trial was a local sensation , made even more sensational shortly afterward when Lee's barrister and a Crown witness both went insane and died . Lee was convicted and sentenced to hang . On 23 February 1885 , he went to the scaffold . . . but something went wrong . The trap refused to open . Lee was taken back to his cell . The trap was tested with weights ; it worked perfectly . Try again , shall we ? Lee was brought back . Again , he mounted the steps to the scaffold . Again , it failed to work . Three times in all , the trap failed . . . yet it worked perfectly each time it was tested . There seems to be a widespread misconception that , when an execution apparatus malfunctions , the prisoner is set free . In fact , Lee's death sentence was changed to life imprisonment . Insisting all along on his innocence , he was eventually released in 1907 . Four years later , with a local barmaid named Kate ( surname uncertain ) , he emigrated to America . Some sources claim that he eventually returned , dying in a West Devon workhouse in 1945 : this has not been verified . This crude 1912 silent film was made in Australia , which explains the film's viewpoint . Most of Australia's white inhabitants at this time were direct descendants of convicts who had been transported from Ireland or England : criminals who , very often , had committed only very minor crimes , or who may even have been innocents falsely convicted . The makers of this movie take every opportunity to depict the Devonshire authorities as corrupt , incompetent , utterly uninterested in such petty details as facts or procedural evidence . As depicted here by the rather effete Mervyn Barrington , John Lee is not merely innocent : he is the people's hero . Most howlingly of all , this film's editing and direction strongly imply that the malfunction of Lee's gallows is an outright case of divine intervention , with God personally protecting Lee from the hangman . . . or perhaps the trap door is kept fast by some superhuman exertion of Lee's will power . This is utter rubbish , of course . It's quite possible that a Victorian gallows would repeatedly fail , with the erratic behaviour of this particular gallows - - working perfectly in tests , yet always failing in a real context - - being only slightly coincidental . If God ( or any other supernatural agency ) really intervened in the execution of John Lee , then why did no deity intervene to save Timothy Evans ( the fall-guy in the John Christie murders ) , or Leo Frank ( lynched for the Mary Phagan rape-murder ) , or any of the many other innocents who were executed for crimes they didn't commit , or who were lynched outright ? I try to rate films based on their effectiveness at what they attempt to do , rather than their factuality . ' The Life Story of John Lee ' plainly intended to tell only one side of a very skewed story , and on that count it succeeds very well . The screening which I attended was made more enjoyable by John Sweeney's excellent piano accompaniment . All in all , I'll rate this experience .
419190	1609079	24308	8.0	Colman's run-up to ' Zenda '	' The Masquerader ' , an obscure drama starring Ronald Colman , is very similar in its premise and subplots to Colman's great vehicle ' The Prisoner of Zenda ' . . . but he did ' The Masquerader ' first . As in ' Zenda ' , Colman plays lookalike cousins who meet after many years of living in two different countries . . . one of whom has an opportunity to take over the other's life , while falling in love with the other man's disenchanted lady . Colman's main role is John Loder ( no relation to the bland actor of that name ) , a disaffected journalist who returns to his native England after many years abroad . Loder's more successful cousin is Sir John Chilcote , a prominent member of Parliament . But Chilcote is secretly a morphine addict , and his addiction is becoming harder to conceal . Also concealed ( not very well ) is Chilcote's philandering relationship with Lady Joyce , while his estranged wife Eve ( Lady Chilcote ) is humiliated on the sidelines . When Sir John's addiction causes him to collapse just before he introduces a crucial piece of legislation , Chilcote's loyal manservant Brock persuades Loder to impersonate his cousin . Loder , pretending to be Chilcote , gives an impassioned speech on the floor of Commons . Lady Chilcote has been estranged from her husband for years ; now , attending this speech , she wonders why she is suddenly attracted to her husband again . . . not realising that this is actually Loder impersonating Lady Chilcote's husband . ( Shades of Princess Flavia in ' Zenda ' . ) Meanwhile , Loder ( still pretending to be Chilcote ) is utterly cold to Chilcote's mistress Lady Joyce , much to her bafflement . SPOILERS COMING . Sir John dies of his addiction , without this becoming public knowledge . Brock persuades Loder to abandon his own life and become Sir John Chilcote permanently , appropriating Chilcote's wealth and reputation . Of course , this means that Loder will now be married to Lady Chilcote . Hmmm . . . ' The Masquerader ' is not very plausible , yet it's quite enjoyable . Ronald Colman gives two distinctly different performances in the lookalike roles . . . although his turn as the drug-addicted Chilcote is a bit too overwrought . Moss Hart's smooth dialogue papers over some of the cracks in the plot line . Gregg Toland's photography is up to his usual high standard , and I was especially impressed by the scenes in which both Ronald Colmans are on screen at the same go . ( Most dual-role movies made during this period featured flat sideline lighting during the double-exposure sequences ; Toland avoids this . ) Also well-photographed is a night sequence in Hyde Park ( filmed on the Goldwyn Studio's backlot ) ; Toland keeps the lighting bright enough for us to see the action , but dark enough to minimise the obvious fakery of the scenery . Creighton Hale is good in a small role . In the role of Lady Eve Chilcote , Elissa Landi is appropriately patrician ( and slightly less blonde than usual ) , but her performance is weak . In the role of Lady Joyce , Juliette Compton is so dull and unattractive that I had difficulty believing Sir John would ever prefer her to his wife . The studio reconstruction of the House of Commons is a lot more convincing than I expected it to be , especially for a Yank film . I'll rate this movie .
418604	1609079	67324	8.0	See me , feel me , touch me .	' Land of Silence and the Darkness ' , written and directed by Werner Herzog , is an extraordinary documentary - - remember that word , please - - about Fini Straubinger . As a child in Germany , she suffered a terrible fall which caused a popping sensation in her neck . She was afraid to tell her parents ( I can well believe this ) , so the injury was never treated . As a teen , she progressively lost her hearing and her sight , becoming totally deaf and blind . When Herzog made this film , Straubinger was well past middle age , and had spent most of her life in silence and darkness . Americans who see this film will be reminded of Helen Keller . But Keller lost her sight and hearing ( to scarlet fever ) in very early childhood , and retained only very slight memory of her stolen senses . ( Touchingly , Keller did recall seeing the rainbows formed by sunlight refracted through the crystal prisms of her mother's chandelier . ) Because Straubinger retained a full memory and understanding of vision and sound , she became useful as an ambassador to the kingdoms of the blind and deaf . Fini Straubinger has dedicated her life to working with people who are deaf and blind , most of whom have borne those double handicaps either from birth or ( like Keller ) from infancy . Herzog follows Straubinger on a trip through Germany , financed by an organisation for the deaf-blind . We see her communicating with other deaf-blind people through a sort of tapping code . Activities which the rest of us take for granted are truly alien experiences for these unfortunate souls . For instance , the simple act of taking a shower : for someone who has never experienced this before , and cannot have it adequately explained , the sudden onslaught of pressurised water is deeply terrifying . In the final sequence , we see a deaf-blind man hugging a tree : attempting to experience this alien life-form through his senses of touch , taste and smell . One sequence , showing Straubinger interacting with a chimpanzee , I found unpleasant and unnecessary . I get the impression that this scene was staged by Herzog in an ill-thought attempt to inject some light ' comedy relief ' into a subject that audiences might find deeply depressing . I made a point of identifying this film as a documentary , meaning it's non-fiction . Indeed , Fini Straubinger is a real person : her blindness , her deafness , and ( more importantly ) her work with the deaf-blind are all real , all true . At one point in this film , Straubinger tells us that her most vivid sensory memory - - before the darkness and silence closed in - - is an image of the rapturous faces of ski jumpers as they leap into the sky . After this film was released , Herzog admitted in an interview that Straubinger had never seen a ski jumper : Herzog wrote those lines for her , because he felt that ski jumpers provided the visual symbol ( I refuse to misuse the word ' metaphor ' ) which would simultaneously represent sensory rapture and Straubinger's own isolation . I reluctantly concede that this sort of fictionalisation is a valid device in documentary films . Those of us who are fortunate to see and hear cannot truly experience the dark silent world of Fini Straubinger and her colleagues . ( Unless we too are conscripted into that realm , by accidents or illness . ) Since this film can never truly put us into the mind of a deaf-blind person - - especially one who has been both deaf and blind since birth , like most of the people encountered here - - some degree of invention is necessary . I recall an anecdote told by Albert Einstein ( too long to repeat here ; send me an email if you want the details ) concerning his attempt to explain milk to a blind man : this incident never actually occurred , but Einstein told the story to prove a point about his theory of relativity . ' Land of Silence and the Darkness ' is a fascinating film about a fascinating human being . My rating : .
419140	1609079	215038	8.0	Walk through this with me	Marcel Aymé ( pronounced ' Ah-may ' ) was France's equivalent to Thorne Smith . Aymé wrote fantasy stories which , like Smith's , tended to feature unobtrusive men whose lives are irrevocably changed by an unexpected encounter with the supernatural , not always ending happily but usually with a bit of sex along the way . There are also distinct similarities between Aymé's works and the stories of James Thurber . Some of Aymé's best stories , intriguingly , were written during the Nazi occupation . ( This is especially evident in his bitter story ' La Carte ' . ) My own favourite Aymé tale is ' La Grace ' , about an ordinary man - a decent individual , but hardly a candidate for sainthood - who suddenly finds himself equipped with an unwanted halo . Desperate to get rid of this inconvenience , he proceeds to commit every imaginable sin . . . but can't get rid of that halo . The TV production ' Le Passe-muraille ' , a one-off comedy , adapts Aymé's story of the same name , his best-known tale . Its title would roughly translate into English as ' The Passer-Through-Walls ' . This same story was adapted into the musical ' Amour ' , which flopped quickly on Broadway in 2002 . It's not hard to see why : ' Le Passe-muraille ' is a charming bit of froth , without the substance or plot line to sustain a full-length evening . Monsieur Dutilleul ( Michel Serrault ) is a typical Aymé hero : an obscure little clerk , a Parisian version of Cosmo Topper or a less imaginative version of Walter Mitty . One night in his flat , with the lights out , Dutilleul finds himself in the wrong room and can't account for how he got there . After some experimentation , it dawns on him that he can walk through walls . He never does learn how or when he acquired this ability . Being a creature of habit , Dutilleul goes to see a doctor ( Jean Obé ) , who blithely prescribes pills for this unusual condition . More as a failure of nerve than a desire to retain his new ability , Dutilleul accepts the pills but does not swallow them . Shyly at first , Dutilleul experiments with his newfound power to walk through walls . There is a very funny scene in which Dutilleul is summoned to his boss's office and slated for a minor matter . Returning to his own office to lick his wounds , Dutilleul has a clever idea . He sticks his head through the intervening wall , confronting his boss in the form of a head on the wall , like a taxidermy trophy . ' Sir , you are an idiot ! ' Dutilleul remarks , then recedes into the wall again . When the apoplectic boss rushes to Dutilleul's office , everything is of course normal . . . and Dutilleul feigns innocence . As Dutilleul becomes bolder in his ghostly ventures , he commits daring burglaries . . . eventually frightening all of Paris , as rumours spread of a super-thief known only as Garou-Garou ( roughly , the Werewolf ) . Of course , it dawns on Dutilleul that his new ability can benefit his sex life . Like the original story , this television comedy is quite funny until the ending , at which point ( again like the original ) it becomes quite bitter . The special effects in the wall-walking sequences are very poorly done - ' Twilight Zone ' did this sort of thing much better , more than a decade earlier - but this does no harm to the story's basic enjoyabilty . A nice bit of singing by Jean-Marc Recchia at the end . I'll rate this telefilm .
418502	1609079	69483	8.0	Brilliant enactment of Thurber's ' Last Flower '	' The War Between Men and Women ' was originally a suite of drawings by cartoonist / author James Thurber , depicting quite literally an all-out war between the two sexes . Thurber was an embittered misogynist ( as well as a philanderer ) , so it's no surprise that he ended his " War " with the women offering unconditional surrender to the men . During his boyhood in Ohio , Thurber's older brother bullied him into a stupid game that cost young James an eye and seriously infected his other eye . Thurber's mother , for her own stupid reasons , delayed getting her son medical treatment for his surviving eye . ( This may be one reason why he hated women . ) For the rest of his life , Thurber experienced increasing blindness in his one eye , eventually requiring an enormous magnifying lens in order to see his own cartoons as he drew them . In addition to hating women , Thurber disliked most men too : one of his favourite tricks at social functions was to goad the most popular man in the room until the man was provoked into hitting Thurber . . . thus becoming a social pariah for assaulting a blind man . The 1972 film ' The War Between Men and Women ' is an intriguing comedy-drama , an intelligent attempt to do something different . . . that ultimately fails . Part of the problem is this movie's deeply misleading title , which seems to promise sexual come-ons that never arrive . The central character ( played by Jack Lemmon ) is clearly inspired by the life and works of James Thurber , yet is significantly different from Thurber . ( For one thing , he's a much nicer guy . ) It's clear that scriptwriters Danny Arnold and Mel Shavelson have a deep love for Thurber's work . Shortly before this film , they had worked on the brilliant ( though unsuccessful ) TV series ' My World and Welcome to It ' , deeply inspired by Thurber's writings and cartoons . Shavelson had tried to dramatise Thurber's work at least as far back as ' Christabel ' , a 1959 episode of ' Goodyear Theatre ' . Peter Wilson ( Lemmon ) is a cartoonist / author who is trying not to deal with the fact that he's going blind . An operation might save his sight , or it might accelerate the deterioration of his remaining vision . He has an annoying ' meet cute ' with Terry Kozlenko ( Barbara Harris ) , a divorcée with three disaffected children . A romance develops between Peter and Terry , with Peter attempting to be a surrogate father to her kids . But their father ( Jason Robards ) isn't completely out of the picture : he's a macho journalist whose book of war photographs is a best-seller . Lemmon brilliantly depicts mounting frustration as Peter realises that he and his twee storybooks can't compete with the derring-do of Terry's first husband . A fine performance as Terry's son David is given by an extremely talented child actor with the ill-fitting name Moosie Drier . ( He doesn't in any way resemble a moose ; why this name ? ) SLIGHT SPOILER COMING . At one point , Peter attempts a father-son talk with David while they stroll along a quay : suddenly David slips and falls into the water . . . and he can't swim ! The look on Lemmon's face is astonishing , as the nearly blind Peter realises it's up to him to save the drowning boy . The best performance in this film is given by Lisa Gerritsen , a dynamically talented child actress who was also in ' My World and Welcome to It ' . ( Gerritsen , now an adult , reportedly has cut all ties to her thespian career . ) Terry's daughter Linda ( Gerritsen ) feels stigmatised by her speech impediment ; Peter feels a bond with her because of his own encroaching blindness . In this film's most lyrical scene , Peter attempts to convey the act of creativity to Linda through his picturebook story ' The Last Flower ' . This is actually an apocalyptic tale written and drawn by Thurber , brought to life here by splendid animation . In addition to despising women , James Thurber was a dog-lover . The funniest line in this movie occurs when Peter and Terry take her pregnant dog for a walk . Co-scripter Danny Arnold makes a cameo appearance as a cop , giving himself the chance to speak this line : a line that's not in James Thurber's writings , but which is so bluntly misogynist that Thurber would have howled in glee if he'd heard it . Despite this film's misleading title , the makers of ' The War Between Men and Women ' showed real guts in attempting this unusual story . Based solely on my own tastes , I'll rate it . Now , if someone would make a film version of Thurber's ' The Wonderful O ' , I could die happy .
418295	1609079	288822	8.0	Informative and fun documentary .	' It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ' is one of my all-time favourite comedies , one of the very few movies I've watched repeatedly . ( One reason I've managed to see so many movies is because I very seldom allocate the time to watch any movie I've already seen . " Mad World ' is one of the few exceptions that I'll watch over and over . ) Roundabout the sixth or seventh time I watched ' Mad World ' , I twigged that there isn't a single punchline in this very funny comedy : all of the humour comes from physical action and the characters ' reactions . The most hilarious scene is the one in which Jonathan Winters wrecks Arnold Stang's and Marvin Kaplan's service garage . As brilliant as ' Mad World ' is , it's a very unwieldy film . It would have worked better with fewer comedians making cameo appearances , since many of the ones who get a look-in are given nothing to do . The idea of casting the Three Stooges as firemen is downright hilarious , but in the film they merely make a brief appearance in firemen's gear : they never get to wreak any havoc . Many other comedians in this film are likewise wasted . If ' Mad World ' were remade today , the story would never work : most of the characters would have cell phones , and they would behave differently . I've read the script of ' It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ' : it contains many scenes that were never shot at all . Spencer Tracy absolutely refused to work after five p . m . ( the time of day when he started drinking ) , and thus many of his scenes were never filmed . Among the unfilmed is a brief dialogue scene between Tracy and Sid Caesar . More interesting ( but also unfilmed ) is a touching dialogue sequence between Caesar and Edie Adams aboard Ben Blue's aeroplane , when they think they're going to win the race and get all the money . Adams reminisces about her early days in a demeaning hotel job in Saint Joseph , Missouri , when her co-workers humiliated her : now she plans to return to that hotel as a wealthy guest , and humiliate her former co-workers . ( Screenwriter William Rose was from St Joseph , Missouri : I wonder if this scene was autobiographical . ) Maddeningly , many sequences that were shot for ' Mad World ' were deleted . I especially regret the loss of a poignant telephone scene between Tracy and Buster Keaton as a reformed crook who owns a motorboat that can take Tracy to Mexico . When Tracy goes to the drugstore to eat an ice cream sundae , it's actually a pretext for him to use a coin phone to ring up Keaton . This is the scene that would have informed audiences of Tracy's plan to steal the money . As the movie now stands , Keaton's relationship to Tracy remains unclear , and it's also unclear precisely when Tracy's character turns crooked . For years , I'd hoped to rediscover the excised Buster Keaton footage : I now sadly believe that it no longer exists . When ' Mad World ' was re-released on video in 1991 , there was some publicity about ' restored footage ' . The only restored footage is during the service garage sequence - - we see highway patrolmen cowering behind their cars while Winters wrecks the garage - - and this added footage makes the movie less funny , not more so . ' Something a Little Less Serious ' is an informal documentary that was added to the ' 91 video . Director Stanley Kramer and some of the participants in ' Mad World ' have reunited for an informal lunch , in which they share some memories of the movie . Kramer had a reputation for earnest movies about racism and Nazi war crimes , so ' It's a Mad World ' was his attempt to create something a little less serious . I learnt a few interesting facts here . Arnold Stang broke his left wrist shortly before production began - - Stang is left-handed - - but he chose to conceal the injury so that he wouldn't be replaced . In the shot when Stang and Kaplan pick up a truck axle and use it as a battering ram , Stang is holding the axle with only his right hand . We also learn that Winters was mentally unstable throughout the shoot , channelling weird personalities . . . such as the Tuesday Bear , who only comes out on the Tuesdays . At the climax of the film , Winters and Dick Shawn are in the money pit together , respectively wielding a pickaxe and a shovel . This documentary reveals that Shawn was unwilling to stand in a pit alongside Winters while Winters was brandishing a pickaxe , due to Winters's erratic behaviour . I wish that Sid Caesar had shared here a memory which he previously divulged in a magazine interview , concerning his scenes in ' Mad World ' with Edie Adams , who played his wife . In real life , Adams's husband Ernie Kovacs had recently died in a road accident ; she was despondent , but had to keep working in order to pay off Kovacs's debts . It fell to Caesar to keep her spirits upbeat during the production of this movie . ( Sid Caesar's role in this film had originally been written for Kovacs ; Caesar got the role only due to Kovacs's death . ) This documentary also includes clips from ' Mad World ' , but they seem to be chosen at random and don't illustrate what the ' talking heads ' are saying . I'll rate this documentary , for giving me an opportunity to revisit one of my favourite comedies from a fresh angle .
419254	1609079	26121	9.0	Paul Muni tour de force	In ' Black Fury ' , Paul Muni gives one of his best performances , and also appears onscreen in one of his more plausible make-ups . This time he plays a Slavic immigrant , uneducated but keenly intelligent , working in an American coal mine . Muni's hair is dyed blond , yet looks realistic , and his own Eastern European facial features work with this characterisation . . . not against it , as they did for some of his other roles . The film also features a fine performance from John Qualen , a prolific character actor whose film appearances were often marred by unconvincing and unnecessary foreign accents of the " yumpin ' yiminy ! " sort . In ' Black Fury ' , Qualen's flavour-of-the-month accent is less obtrusive than usual , and it actually works for the character he plays : a Polish-American miner . Joe Radek ( Muni ) is a miner in a ' company town ' , where all the labourers are poorly-paid and live in squalid shanties . Radek and his fellow miners work in extremely dangerous conditions . The company that owns the mine also owns all the local businesses , and the local police force also works for the mining company . The cops have no interest in justice : they're bullies whose only concern is to keep the locals quiet and subservient to the company . The head cop is a slimy sadist named McGee , well-played by Barton MacLane . Radek's buddy Shemanski ( Qualen ) gets drunk one night and makes the mistake of criticising company policy : staggering home that night , he has a fatal ' accident ' arranged by McGee's goons . To call attention to various grievances , Radek fills the mineshaft with dynamite . He packs several days ' worth of food for himself , then he takes McGee hostage at gunpoint and brings him into the mine . Radek chains McGee to the pit face , slightly out of reach of Radek's food supply . If Radek's demands aren't met , he's going to blow up the mine . . . with himself and McGee inside . After they've been in the mine for several days , there's one harrowing shot of the starving McGee chained to the wall , begging Radek for food . The film ends with one of those slam-bang action climaxes that Warner Bros did so well , spiced with some social commentary that doesn't get too preachy . The film boasts an excellent supporting cast , filled with actors who are ( mostly ) more obscure than usual , which helps us to immerse ourselves in the action . Karen Morley , quietly beautiful , gives a fine performance , and Michael Curtiz ( a very underrated director ) does his usual superlative work . ' Black Fury ' is based on a story by Michael A . Musmanno , a Pennsylvania lawyer of Italian descent . Late in his life , Musmanno devoted several decades to writing a book called ' Columbus Was First ' , which purported to prove that no European explorers reached the Americas before Columbus . Musmanno's claims for Columbus have long since been disproven , but ' Black Fury ' is an excellent film . I'll rate this movie . Trivia note : Shortly after this movie was released , Warner Brothers released a Loony Toon starring Porky Pig as a hunter who had a dog named Black Fury . What a shameless plug !
419496	1609079	35105	9.0	Roz is riotously funny	' My Sister Eileen ' is based on true incidents . Ruth and Eileen McKenney were sisters from a small town in Ohio who came to New York City : Ruth intending to become an author , Eileen hoping to be an actress . Although Ruth McKenney sold a few magazine pieces , her most successful work was her series of fictionalised articles about the misadventures of her younger sister Eileen . The stories themselves have been out of print for many years , but they provided the basis for a popular play , ' My Sister Eileen ' ( NOT written by Ruth McKenney ) , which was a long-running Broadway hit and which has remained in print ever since . Ruth McKenney ironically gained fame and wealth from a play written by two other people , based on her stories . The real Eileen McKenney ended badly . A pretty actress with more looks than talent , she married the overrated screenwriter Nathanael West and she died alongside him in West's fatal car accident . The 1942 film ' My Sister Eileen ' is a faithful ( and funny ) version of the Broadway hit , although it bears only slight resemblance to the real-life exploits of sisters Ruth and Eileen McKenney ( here renamed Sherwood ) . Rather unusually , this movie was made at Columbia Studios during the play's Broadway run . Two of the best performances here are given by actors repeating their stage roles : Gordon Jones as an obsessive football player named ' The Wreck ' , and Richard Quine as nice young man Frank Lippincott , who fancies Eileen . Small-town sisters Ruth and Eileen come to the big city . Ruth ( Rosalind Russell ) is smart , cynical , and doesn't need a man . Eileen ( Janet Blair ) is naive and pretty and attracts all the lads . Because the sisters haven't got much money , the only place they can afford is a basement flat in Greenwich Village , owned by a crooked landlord named Appopolous ( George Tobias , not up to his usual high standard here ) . The flat is directly above a subway tunnel , where construction workers are blasting with dynamite : at regular intervals , the whole building shakes . Worse luck , the previous tenant was a young lady who ( ahem ! ) rented by the hour , and so Ruth and Eileen are constantly plagued with male visitors who assume that their apartment is still , erm , open for business . Ruth and Eileen have no end of misadventures while trying to start their careers as , respectively , a journalist and an actress . BIG SPOILER STARTING NOW . The last gag in this movie is absolutely hilarious . All through the film , we hear the sounds of the subway navvies directly under Ruth and Eileen's apartment . At the very end of this movie , a jackhammer pokes up through the floor and three construction workers emerge . When they pull off their helmets , we see that they're Moe , Larry and Curly ! Moe lambastes his two ' knucklehead ' workmates while the soundtrack starts playing the ' Three Stooges ' theme tune ! In 1953 , Betty Comden and Adolph Green approached Rosalind Russell to star in a Broadway musical version of ' My Sister Eileen ' with music by Leonard Bernstein , to be called ' Wonderful Town ' . ( The original title wasn't legally available . ) I really dislike ' Wonderful Town ' : it has a score which I consider extremely pretentious . Rosalind Russell , to her credit , had no illusions about her own song-and-dance abilities . ' Wonderful Town ' was never filmed , because Columbia had retained the musical rights . . . and they made their OWN musical version in 1955 , with tunes by Jule Styne that are vastly better than anything " Lenny " Bernstein ever wrote . Interestingly , Richard Quine ( who hed acted in the original film and the Broadway cast ) directed the musical remake , and his role as Frank Lippincott was taken over by Bob Fosse , giving his best performance as an actor and choreographing some snappy dance numbers as well . I strongly recommend both film versions of ' My Sister Eileen ' , which is more than I can say for the overrated ' Wonderful Town ' . I'll rate this 1942 version . Well done !
418795	1609079	420	9.0	Lewis Carroll would have loved this !	Cecil Hepworth is a vitally important figure in Britain's early cinema , but his achievements were compromised by the fact that he was a poor businessman and poor planner . Prints of his most popular films - - such as " Comin ' Thro the Rye " and " The Joke that Failed " - - were sold outright to exhibitors , causing Hepworth to wear out the original negatives . In order to meet continuing demand for new prints , he was forced to re-shoot these movies in their entirety ! Hepworth probably deserves credit for filming the first remake . Charles Dodgson ( better known as Lewis Carroll , author of ' Alice in Wonderland ' ) died in 1898 , in the very earliest years of Britain's cinema , and there is no surviving record of him ever having seen a movie . ( Dodgson's vast archive of correspondence was burnt by his family after his death , and his diary was censored : there may well have been a movie review in there someplace . ) Yet I'm 100 % certain that Dodgson would have been a cinephile . He was an expert and enthusiastic amateur photographer , he had a deep love of the theatre , and the ' Alice ' books contain several devices which seem more cinematic than literary : Alice is subjected to the shot change , the jump cut , the dissolve , and so forth . Cecil Hepworth's 1903 film version of ' Alice in Wonderland ' - - apparently the first movie version of that oft-filmed book - - was made barely five years after Dodgson's death . Scantly nine minutes long , this crude ' trick ' movie necessarily shows only a few fragments of the novel . The uncredited production designer ( Hepworth himself ? ) has clearly made considerable effort to base the sets and costumes on Sir John Tenniel's beloved illustrations , so it's strange that the central character looks nothing at all like Tenniel's Alice : the actress cast here has long black hair , and her pinafore is nearly ankle-length . Quite impressively , Alice actually falls into a genuine hole in the ground . To show her plunging vertically ( as in the novel ) would have been technically difficult to stage , so we see her creeping through a slanting shaft , in an impressive cutaway shot ( the cinema's first ) ? Some of the special effects are achieved through simple jump cuts , much less flamboyant than what Georges Melies was doing in France at this time . Alice's growth spurt in the White Rabbit's house is amusingly staged by placing the actress intentionally too close to the camera , in an undersized set . I was impressed by one elaborate bit of pageantry in an exterior shot . Alice stands on a broad greensward ( apparently a partial matte shot ) while the 52 members of the pack of cards parade past her , one suit at a time . The print which I viewed had neatly typeset intertitles , but was an acetate print several generations removed from the original . . . so I can't tell if these titles date back to Hepworth's original 1903 production , or were added later . Oddly , the opening title makes a point of telling us that Alice's adventure is a dream : this was only implied in the first chapter of the original novel . More significantly , the dominant figure at the Mad Tea Party is identified in a title here as ' the Mad Hatter ' . This usage is now quite common , but it never appears in Carroll's original novel : nowhere in the text of ' Alice in Wonderland ' is the word ' Hatter ' immediately preceded by the word ' mad ' . The expression ' mad as a hatter ' refers to the fact that 19th-century hatters often developed nervous tics from exposure to the highly toxic vapours of mercuric nitrate . Men's hats in Victorian times were made of felt ; 19th-century hatters cured the felt by a process called ' carroting ' which left a carrot-coloured residue . Since the Hatter in Carroll's novel is never explicitly cried ' the Mad Hatter ' , I'm surprised to find evidence that this popular mis-usage may have been in place as early as 1903 . I wish I could establish the origin of these title cards . Hepworth's production of ' Alice in Wonderland ' is extremely crude by modern standards , and leaves out most of the plot of Carroll's book , as well as the wonderful wordplay . But this film was an extremely ambitious undertaking for its time , and it achieves nearly all of what it set out to accomplish . I'll rate it .
418389	1609079	24562	9.0	A little girl with a big voice .	' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of a series of shorts produced by the Fleischer studio which followed an interesting format : some typical Fleischer black-and-white animation ( cartoon gags with a musical soundtrack ) would book-end a live-action musical performance by some popular vaudeville act of the time . Generally , the title of the short was also the title of the tune sung by the performer . This one has better cartoon gags than most of the series . We're in some sort of baby factory , where the stork prepares the babies for delivery . We see a cartoon version of Eddie Cantor doing his duck-quack routine ( from ' Palmy Days ' ) and a cartoon version of Ed Wynn wearing a fireman's helmet and driving a fire engine : this is a reference to Wynn's popular radio show , sponsored by Texaco , which cast him as ' The Texaco Fire Chief ' . There's also an astonishing gag , featuring a Jewish baby ( with a big nose ) singing ' Shuffle Off to Buffalo ' with new lyrics . The middle sequence is a live-action performance by Baby Rose Marie , a hugely popular child performer from radio and vaudeville of this period . At this point , she was about ten years old , but performed in baby-doll dresses that made her look younger . Her remarkable singing voice resembles the tones of a grown woman ! Nowadays , the considerably older Rose Marie is best known for her adult performance on ' The Dick Van Dyke Show ' . Fans of her adult performances will be fascinated to catch a glimpse of her here , from her child stardom . Apparently there was some sort of legal problem with the live-action sequences in Fleischer's series : on several occasions in recent years , these shorts have resurfaced with the live-action sequences chopped out ; the cartoon builds up to the entrance of a performer who never arrives ! This is a real shame , as the performers in Fleischers series often did very little other film work , so their performances here are of historical value . ' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of the few pieces of film footage of Rose Marie from her years as a child star . I'll rate this short .
419222	1609079	17947	9.0	The tiptoeing gorilla is hilarious	Ralph Spence wrote his play ' The Gorilla ' in the mid-1920s , when Broadway audiences had already seen several dead-earnest thriller plays about spooky old houses full of trapdoors and masked villains . The posters for the 1925 Broadway production of ' The Gorilla ' acknowledged its predecessors , by ballyhooing : ' Out-bats " The Bat " ! Out-cats " The Cat and the Canary " ! Out-warns " The Last Warning " ! ' What made ' The Gorilla ' a hit onstage was the fact that it spoofed the cliches of spooky-house plays while managing to be somewhat scary on its own merits , much as ' Arsenic and Old Lace ' would be a few years later . The various film versions of ' The Gorilla ' downplay the thriller elements , replacing them with lowbrow slapstick comedy . . . thus rendering a wildly improbable storyline even more implausible . Fortunately , the 1927 silent film ( the first screen version ) is quite funny , although it deviates considerably from Spence's play . Sour old miser Cyrus Townsend ( played by sour old character actor Claude Gillingwater ) is murdered . There are several suspects , since Cyrus had many enemies . . . including his brother Uriah ( Tully Marshall ) . Cyrus's daughter ( beautiful black-haired Alice Day ) decides to solve her dad's murder . For some reason , the leading suspect is a gorilla , who appears to have wandered in from the street . ( As gorillas do . ) Or could it be that the gorilla is a murderer in a gorilla suit ? Maybe there are TWO gorillas : a real one , and one in a costume . . . The plot makes no sense at all , but this movie is enjoyable in a demented way . Veteran comic Charlie Murray ( a former Keystone Cop ) steals the show as a dim-witted detective . The funniest scene has Murray tiptoeing through the spooky house in search of the gorilla , unaware that the gorilla is tiptoeing along directly behind him ! This is the sort of routine that Lou Costello did later , but it's much funnier as Murray does it . . . and the silent film gives Murray an advantage over Costello . ( In a silent film , we don't wonder why the comedian doesn't hear the gorilla tiptoeing behind him . ) Eventually , virginal damsel Alice Day ends up in the clutches of the gorilla . Just so we get the symbolism , Alice wears a diaphanous white outfit in this scene that makes her look very virginal . The photography and direction are excellent , and there are some impressively creepy scenes centred in a spiral staircase worthy of Hitchcock's ' Vertigo ' . HERE COMES THE SPOILER RIGHT NOW . Handsome young Walter Pidgeon , who is so helpful to sweet Alice , turns out to be the dastardly villain . Interestingly , Pidgeon was also in the 1930 remake of ' The Gorilla ' , although in a different role . I'll rate this silent version , despite its wild implausibility .
419091	1609079	174990	9.0	78 ( Russian ) revolutions per minute	The Russian comedy film ' New Moscow ' is barely known even in Russia ; apparently it incurred the wrath of the commissars during its original screening in 1938 , and was suppressed afterward . I'm amazed that it survived at all . Alyosha ( played by Daniil Sagal , uncle of Peg Bundy ! ) is a Siberian farmboy who looks amazingly like the Bolshevik version of Li'l Abner . But Alyosha longs to be an architect and urban planner : accordingly , he has designed and built a model of a glorious utopian city which he calls ' Moscow Future ' : if only the commissars will listen to him , Moscow Future will become reality . ( Among its other merits - - by communist standards - - this Moscow has no trace of Saint Basil's Cathedral nor any other church . ) Alyosha schleps his model all the way to the real Moscow , where urban renewal is in progress . This is a source of dismay for Fedia ( Pavel Sukhanov ) , a cityscape painter who can't finish any of his paintings . . . because the old buildings are torn down and new ones erected more quickly than he can paint them . While Alyosha prepares his presentation , he falls in love with little blonde Zoya ( Nina Alisova ) , who looks like a somewhat more modest and chaste Russian version of Daisy Mae Scragg . The high point of the film is when Alyosha activates his model city , and it almost magically seems to come to life . But this is a comedy , so the mechanism gets jammed in reverse . Alyosha is horrified as his midget Moscow actually begins to regress to its Czarist condition , with onion domes springing up and so forth . I was very impressed with the production design of this film , as well as by the performances of several of the actors . Some of the comedy is still funny after all these five-year plans . Writer-director Alexander Medvedkin is clearly critical of Stalin's regime : I applaud him for having the guts to say so in 1938 , and I'm astounded that this film was permitted to survive . I'll rate ' New Moscow ' .
418431	1609079	383694	9.0	If this movie was accurate , I wouldn't be alive .	Mike Leigh is a brilliant filmmaker , whose films feature impeccable production design . Reportedly , Leigh never writes a script : he preps his actors in their characterisations , and then all dialogue is improvised on the set ! I found only one production flaw in ' Vera Drake ' : Susan , the upper-class young Londoner in 1950 , sports a Bettie Page hairdo that is simply not appropriate for her character's social class at this time . ( Women in postwar Britain favoured ' austerity ' hairstyles . ) ' Vera Drake ' is one of Leigh's best films , but there's a dishonesty at the centre of this film that should not pass unmentioned . I'm just barely old enough to recall Britain in the early 1950s . Vera Drake is a fiftyish prole who works as a daily for wealthier women . . . one of whom has a daughter who gets date-raped , resulting in a pregnancy . Her situation is depicted accurately : although abortion is illegal in 1950s Britain , exceptions are made for women who can get a psychiatrist's consent . . . and who can afford to pay for the surgical procedure in hospital . We see Vera Drake doing charitable work for various impoverished people in her neighbourhood . Because Leigh wants to manipulate our opinions , he is careful to establish his heroine as selfless by first showing Vera calling on elderly shut-ins . Only later do we learn the real agenda of this movie : among her other services , Vera performs illegal syringe abortions on young women . Leigh gets even more manipulative by setting up an extremely contrived situation in which Vera doesn't realise that the women are paying money for this service : all the lolly goes to Lily , the woman who pimps Vera's services while selling black-market goods . So , Vera is performing abortions without expecting any payment . Vera's son , an assistant tailor , does a spot of spivving on the side , selling black-market nylons and cigarettes . All of this is clearly meant to dilute the stigma of Vera's work as an abortionist . Most of the casting is first-rate , as usual for Leigh . I disliked Imelda Staunton in the sitcom ' Is It Legal ? ' , but here as Vera she gives a virtuoso performance . The actress cast as Vera's daughter Ethel actually resembles Staunton . The brothers Stan and Frank are played by actors who resemble each other . The one false note is the casting of the actor who plays Vera's and Stan's son , who doesn't resemble either of them . The very sexy and talented Fenella Woolgar ( an actress of whom I expect great things ) is impressive in her one scene in this film . I mentioned a central dishonesty . In 1950s Britain most people were deeply religious , or at least pretended to be ( if they weren't , they usually kept quiet about it ) , and nearly all Britons were opposed to abortion because they sincerely perceived it to be murder . Whether or not you share that opinion , historical truth requires Leigh to acknowledge that religious belief pervaded all social classes in Britain during the time and place where this story unfolds . Yet not one person in ' Vera Drake ' seems to have any sort of religious devotion . This is like setting a movie in the USA during Prohibition but never mentioning booze . Only one character in ' Vera Drake ' voices any moral ( rather than legal ) objection to abortion - - Vera's son - - and the sequence which establishes him as a spiv seems intended to undermine his moral credentials . Leigh clearly isn't interested in entertaining any debate on the abortion issue . ( Given this film's gynaecological plot line , I wonder if Leigh intentionally gave his heroine a name with the initials ' V . D . ' ! ) If this movie depicted postwar Britain accurately , I wouldn't be alive . My parents ( in Scotland , not England ) were deeply impoverished , and had more children than they could afford to raise . If there had not been such an overwhelming moral ( not legal ) stigma attached to abortion at that time , my parents simply would have aborted me . Instead , they handed me over to the postwar government's ' child migrant ' scheme , and I was unwillingly expatriated to Australia as a de-facto orphan . If the people in Britain at that time had actually been like the fictional ones we see in this movie , I wouldn't exist today . ' Vera Drake ' is proficiently and expertly made , but the calculated dishonesty at its centre prevents me from rating this movie a full 10 marks out of 10 . I'll praise Leigh's cinematic talents while condemning his dishonest storytelling , and I'll rate this movie .
418428	1609079	5204	9.0	' plane nonsense	The output of Mack Sennett's Keystone studio has been unfairly stereotyped as mindless slapstick : a steady diet of custard pies and pratfalls , climaxing in a chase . Although many Keystones did conform to that formula , many others did not . Some notable exceptions were the rural comedies starring Ora Carew and Joseph Belmont , featuring a much gentler sort of humour . ' Dizzy Heights and Daring Hearts ' is a Keystoner that varies the formula , placing more emphasis on daredevil thrills . There is some slapstick here , but most of it occurs within a framework of aerial thrills and bravado stunt work ( much of it crudely faked , yet thrilling in its audacity ) . There are laughs here , but the movie is more interested in astonishing us . . . and it does so , delightfully . Chester Conklin , one of Sennett's second-string comedians , plays an unnamed foreign agent , bidding against a rival for an experimental aeroplane . Cora Anderson plays the daughter of the owner of the Eagle aviation company , who is a fine aviatrix in her own right . She's aboard the craft when Chester skyjacks it . There are some trick shots here , blatantly phony yet very impressive for 1915 . Another pilot pursues Chester and his hostage . The ending will please you , although it won't surprise you . Along the way , there are some unexpected laughs and some impressive stunt work . One sequence features the blatant use of a dummy , when Chester gets caught in the aeroplane's spinning propeller . . . but the ' body ' that revolves is obviously a stuffed mannequin . The pacing of this comedy is rapid-fire , faster than usual even by Keystone standards , and the editing is far superior to Keystone's usual fare . As I've mentioned the pacing , here's a good place to clear up a misconception about silent comedies in general and Keystone comedies in particular . There is a modern perception that all silent slapstick films ( especially Keystones ) were intentionally projected too quickly , to speed up the actors . Although there was some intentional undercranking ( to increase the interval between frames , and thus accelerate the action ) , this was rare and was usually reserved for stunt sequences . The misconception arose because modern projectors run at a faster speed than silent-era projectors , and for several decades these old films were always shown at an unnaturally rapid speed . Videotape technology ( and now DVD ) gives us an opportunity to correct this error , restoring these classics to their intended projection rate . ' Dizzy Heights and Daring Hearts ' is thrilling , funny and outrageous , and I'll rate it . Well done , Mack Sennett and Chester Conklin !
418289	1609079	15763	9.0	Hyde-de-high hilarity !	Stan Laurel ( pre-Hardy ) appeared in several short comedies that were parodies of big-budget Hollywood dramas . Although most of these are quite funny , all ( with one exception ) are seriously weakened by extremely low budgets . ' Dr Pyckle and Mr Pryde ' is the exception ; not only is this movie hilarious , but it benefits from some elaborate exterior and interior sets evoking Victorian London . In the early 1980s , when I interviewed Joe Rock ( this movie's producer ) , he recalled that he had obtained access to sets on the Universal Pictures lot , and costumes from Universal's wardrobe department . By 1925 , there had already been several film versions of ' Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ' , including the bootleg ' Der Januskopf ' and at least one parody . Modern audiences , who know Jekyll and Hyde from films rather than from literature , usually miss an important point : in Stevenson's original novel , Mr Hyde is clearly much shorter and much younger than Dr Jekyll , making it truly a shock when we learn that they are the same man . In film adaptations , Jekyll is usually played as a comparatively youthful man , and nearly always portrayed by the same actor who also plays Hyde . . . so we find it implausible that the other characters fail to guess they're the same person . Although Stan Laurel is playing for comedy here , his performance as Mr Pryde is a revelation . Rather than wearing elaborate make-up , he merely puffs out his expressive face , dons a wig and hunches his head into his shoulders . There's also some extremely subtle padding under Laurel's coat , making Mr Pryde a slightly bulkier man than Dr Pyckle . At this point in his pre-Hardy career , Laurel was learning that he'd get bigger laughs by underplaying rather than by chewing the scenery . Here , though , he still has a couple of hand-to-brow moments . . . acceptable because he's guying a serious story . There's a dog here cried Pete the Pup , who may or mayn't be the same canine who appeared as Pete the Dog in some Our Gang comedies . I've never understood why it's allegedly so funny that a dog in the movies has a ring painted round one eye . . . did any real dog ever have such a mark ? Still , I was intrigued here to see a packet labelled ' Dog Cakes ' , a phrase one doesn't see very often these days . I was delighted to spot the London-born Syd Crossley in this film , under Victorian side-whiskers . Two decades later , Crossley would be back in his native England and working with George Formby and Cicely Courtneidge . Joe Rock told me that Crossley had been his assistant in Los Angeles , and supplied entree to British film circles when he accompanied Rock to England in the 1930s . ' Dr Pyckle and Mr Pryde ' is hilarious from start to finish . If all of Stan Laurel's early comedies had been this good , he would never have needed to team up with Oliver Hardy . I'm certainly glad it happened , though . My rating for this one : . I wonder if this hilarious movie influenced the classic Two Ronnies sketch ' The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town ' .
419718	1609079	365135	10.0	Cunning stunts !	I attended a press screening of ' Double Dare ' , so I got to meet this film's director and editor as well as the documentary's main subjects - - Jeannie Epper and Zoë Bell - - and to participate in Q & A . I sceptically asked if any of this material was staged : specifically , the sequence in which the documentary camera crew just happen to be present ( with camera rolling ) when Zoë Bell gets the ' phone call informing her that she's been hired to stunt-double for Uma Thurman in ' Kill Bill ' , and the stunt coordinator's voice down the ' phone line sounds perfectly clear . Director Amanda Micheli assured me that this scene was dinkum , saying : ' I staked her out for ten days , with a ' phone tap , until she got that call . ' Then Micheli admitted that one thing in this movie was faked : Bell had got a haircut while this documentary was in production , so in some of the documentary footage ( shown out of chronological sequence ) , she wears a wig so that the shots will match . The title of ' Double Dare ' is a pun : these women double for actresses in stunt sequences . My only complaint about this very moving documentary is that it tells us nearly nothing about the history of stunt women . We see a brief clip of Pearl White doing her own stunts in a silent serial . ( Helen Gibson would have been a better choice for inclusion here : she did her own stunts in ' The Hazards of Helen ' , and also stunt-doubled for Helen Holmes . ) There was a long period in which Hollywood actresses were always doubled by males , usually small-statured men such as Dave Sharpe . All we get about that here is a rostrum shot of TV actress Irene Ryan in costume and make-up with her ( very unconvincing ) male double . I wish that Micheli had included film clips such as the fight between Edna May Oliver and Blanche Yurka in ' Tale of Two Cities ' ( both of them blatantly doubled by brawny men in 18th-century frocks and poke bonnets ) , or Betty Hutton's leap off a bridge into a moving jeep in ' Star Spangled Rhythm ' ( doubled by a stuntman in a wig and skirt that don't conceal his linebacker physique ) . The opening sequence of ' Double Dare ' shows a stunt woman preparing for a fire stunt , in full body harness : ironically , the burning woman whizzes by so rapidly , she could just as well have been a dummy . Every scene in ' Double Dare ' is fascinating , but the real eye-opener is a conference between male and female stunters ( they have different trade guilds ) , in which the stunt men make it clear that they don't respect stunt women as equals . Some of this is down to the fact that men tend to get much more dangerous stunt work than women , yet some of the hostility towards these women is just macho arrogance . The female stunters expect equality and respect ( fair enough ) , yet in this footage they refer to each other as ' girls ' . Jeannie Epper , ageing gracefully from stunt woman to stunt coordinator , points out that a stuntman can wear padding under his costume , but stunt women are usually dressed in skimpy outfits with no such option . . . and stunt women must often run in heels ! Having briefly done stunt work myself , I can testify that stunt men have one disadvantage that women don't : when doing a long rolling fall downstairs as a double for a male actor , I had to keep track of when my face was towards the camera , and I periodically had to raise my arm ( while falling ) to conceal my face , which didn't resemble the actor's face . Stunt women , using make-up and long wigs , can hide their faces more easily than stunt men . Speaking of padding , in one sequence of ' Double Dare ' we see stunt women squealing in girlish glee as they try on the falsies they'll need for body-doubling a busty actress . We see Jeannie Epper ( a grandmother , but still a working stunt woman ! ) pricing the plastic surgery she'll need if she hopes to carry on doubling for young actresses . And there's one bizarre sequence , in which a stunt woman proudly shows off her new breast implants to her colleagues . . . who admire her new breasts while ignoring her enormous facial mole . I'm often sceptical when showbiz people trot out their ' spiritual ' beliefs , but I was intrigued when Epper and Bell separately discussed their deep belief in Jesus . Epper asserts that God is protecting her . Stunt people , whether male or female , must trust the stunt riggers and support crew , placing their own safety entirely in these people's hands . It had never occurred to me that this situation parallels the sincere faith that some people place in a deity . Amanda Micheli's direction and camera work are excellent , most notably in a sequence where Bell practises dives from a high ladder into an air bag : Micheli and her camera are above Bell on this lofty perch . If you've got vertigo , you might want to skip this scene . We get sound bites from Lynda Carter ( for whom Epper doubled ) and from Lucy Lawless , for whom Bell doubled . . . although Bell wittily notes : ' She's my acting double . ' Even the end credits are fascinating . During the documentary , we meet Jeannie Epper's daughter Eurlyne , who followed her mother into stunt work but now has an injury that may end her career . As the film ends , Zoë Bell is riding high as Thurman's stunt double . Then the end credits tell us the aftermath : Eurlyne Epper has recovered and is stunting again . . . but Bell injured herself during ' Kill Bill ' and will require surgery . ( Yet she'd recovered in time for the screening I attended . You go , Zoë ! ) I found every frame of ' Double Dare ' fascinating . . . and there are even a few scenes that convey a girls'-locker-room camaraderie , without ever diminishing the dignity of these craftswomen . The stunt women are rigged , but my vote isn't : I rate this movie .
419007	1609079	279784	10.0	Delightful musical comedy short	A previous IMDB reviewer has said that " Dora's Dunking Doughnuts " is about a boy who's afraid of dogs . That reviewer is thinking of a different movie , called " Pardon My Pups " . Both are short comedies which feature Shirley Temple before her stardom . Both of these films have been released on video as part of a compendium of Shirley Temple shorts , which explains why the reviewer has got them switched . " Dora's Dunking Doughnuts " is often packaged as a Shirley Temple film ; she's prominently featured in a supporting role , but she is certainly not the central character here . " Dora's Dunking Doughnuts " was made at Al Christie's low-budget Educational studio , which ( despite its name ) specialised in short comedies . ( Educational started out making educational films , then producer Christie discovered that slapstick was more profitable . ) The star of this film is silent-film comedian Andy Clyde , cast here as a bashful schoolmaster and speaking his dialogue in a soft Perthshire accent . Andy is sweet on Dora , who runs a small roadside diner which isn't getting much custom . But her food is good , especially her doughnuts : if only she could afford to advertise , and attract more customers ! Andy maintains order ( just barely ) over a classroom of students , ranging widely in age . They're all good kids , but very mischievous . Little Shirley is the prize pupil . Andy organises his students into an orchestra and chorus , then he uses his savings to buy some air time on the local radio station . This is quite realistic : in the golden age of radio , many shows were " on sustaining " , meaning that the performers had no sponsor and they paid for their own air time . We see some very unrealistic yet amusing shenanigans at the radio station , including a performance by a matronly singer ( Florence Gill ) who clucks her song as if she were a chicken . Andy leads his schoolkids in a rendition of an advertising jingle , " Dora's Dunking Doughnuts " , which is actually quite enjoyable . But of course a few things go wrong during the live broadcast . . . Special attention should be paid to Bud Jamison , unfortunately misspelt in the credits of this film as ' Jamieson ' . Bud Jamison was the greatest straight man in the history of film comedy ! He worked with most of the greatest comedians in the first 50 years of American films , including Chaplin , Keaton , WC Fields and the Three Stooges . In the Stooges classic ' Disorder in the Court ' , Jamison is the defence attorney who hands Curly a revolver while speaking the immortal line " Never fear , it's not loaded . " Bud Jamison gave sterling service in many of the greatest comedies of the 1920s through ' 40s ( and in a lot of obscure comedies too ) , yet he remains utterly unknown to old-movie fans . . . probably because Jamison specialised in making other comedians seem funnier than they were . Here in " Dora's Dunking Doughnuts " , Jamison is quite funny as the put-upon manager of the small-time radio station . I'll rate this nice comedy-musical short . You'll probably watch it to see Shirley Temple , and Andy Clyde is excellent in the lead role . ( Ethel Sykes is quite good too , as the titular Dora . ) But please rewind it and watch it again , this time concentrating on Bud Jamison's expert comedy timing .
419425	1609079	240823	10.0	Two men with three lordships between them .	Many early films which purport to show major public figures are actually staged enactments , featuring impersonators on mostly unconvincing stage mock-ups . Just occasionally , a film might contain authentic footage of the person it claimed to depict , in an authentic setting but in a staged situation . A good example of this is ' McKinley at Home ' ( 1896 ) , by British film pioneer William Dickson , which purports to show William McKinley at his Ohio residence at the moment when he receives the telegram announcing that he is the Republican Party's candidate for President . Although this short film actually depicts McKinley on the lawn of his home , the action is a staged re-enactment of an event that had already occurred : McKinley had already been notified of his nomination before the ( staged ) film was made . Two years after that newsreel , Dickson made ' Pope Leo XIII and Count Pecci ' : another short film which ( unlike the previous one ) is absolutely free of fakery . Although Dickson's camera is static , the photography is clear and detailed . We can make out specific aspects of the landscaping of the Vatican Gardens , and the architecture of the nearby buildings . I was not able to identify these details , but that's purely down to my lack of knowledge about the Vatican , and not in any way a fault of Dickson's photography . Pope Leo the Thirteenth , looking remarkably like American character actor Paul Stewart , is seen here with his older brother Giuseppe , who ( as Count Pecci ) was a member of the Italian peerage and a priest in his own right ( thus being a lord temporal as well as a lord spiritual ) . The affection between the two elderly brothers is quite evident in this impressively photographed tableau . There's a strong physical resemblance between them , as well . So far as I know , this film doesn't represent any specific historic incident : the count is merely paying a call upon his younger brother , who happens to be the Pope . Still , for its undeniable historic value - - as well as for the fact that it marks an ongoing maturity of newsreel photography , progressing away from faked stagings - - I'll rate this brief newsreel points .
418460	1609079	13033	10.0	Unflinchingly honest . Brilliant !	I saw ' Crainquebille ' in October 2005 at the Cinema Muto festival in northern Italy . . . at which was also screened the film's original ' suppressed ' ending . This movie has previously been reviewed for IMDb by a self-appointed count ( who gave himself one vowel too many ) . He has managed to get several details wrong ? Crainquebille's barrow is a pushcart , not an oxcart ? and has avoided some major aspects of the story . I viewed the same print ( restored by Lobster Films ) which the so-called count claims to have seen . Let's try again , shall we ? ' Crainquebille ' was originally a novel by Anatole France , the pseudonymous French author who was obsessed with justice , law and the rights of the poor . IMDb incorrectly classifies this movie as a fantasy ; the movie is a faithful rendering of the novel , which has no fantasy elements apart from a nightmare sequence . Jerome Crainquebille is an elderly costermonger , just barely making a living off the fruit and vegetables he sells from his barrow . He unintentionally offends a constable , who hauls him off to gaol . Although Crainquebille serves only a brief sentence , this interruption is enough to ruin his barely stable existence . He is soon evicted from his garret and sleeping rough in the street . The real power of this very powerful film is its unflinchingly honest depiction of the underside of Paris . We see prostitutes who are weather-beaten , sore and ragged . ( I'm well weary of movies in which the streetwalkers wear expensive clothes , and have perfect coiffures and makeup . ) There are some fascinating shots of Les Halles , the central market . When the pauper Crainquebille is in prison , he discovers that his standard of living has actually got better , not worse : his prison cell has running water , a clean floor , and other conveniences he never knew before . The only unrealistic scene is Crainquebille's trial , which is surrealistically shown from the hapless defendant's perspective . A prosecution witness turns into a giant , whilst a defence witness dwindles to the size of an insect . The statue of Justice comes to life and rebukes the defendant . The prosecuting advocate is asleep , whilst the defence advocate is filling out his betting slips . Although Anatole France had a deep contempt for his nation's judicial system , he does at least depict the prison governors as honest . Here , when a sympathetic witness tries to give 100 francs to the imprisoned Crainquebille through intermediaries , the money actually does reach him . The camera-work is impressive throughout this film , not least in the surrealistic trial sequence . Also impressive is Doctor Mathieu's nightmare . . . much of which is shown in negative print , so that black and white are reversed . There is a stark climactic sequence , in which Crainquebille leans over the Seine and contemplates suicide . . . only to change his mind when an object plunges into the water ahead of him . This sequence strongly reminded me of the famous scene in ' It's a Wonderful Life ' when George Bailey considers drowning himself . I wonder if Frank Capra saw this movie ? Elswhere , there is comedy that's very funny indeed . . . but it's the bitter comedy of real life . SPOILING ALTERNATE ENDING . Also screened at Cinema Muto was the director's original ( unedited ) ending for this film , which was ultimately scrapped in favour of a more upbeat ending . In this version , we see Crainquebille and his boy assistant outside a posh restaurant . Along comes Madame Laure , the respectable shopwoman who caused so much trouble for Crainquebille earlier . . . but now she's a rouged prostitute , with a wealthy customer ! The man gives Crainquebille a 100-franc note , which Crainquebille disdainfully tosses into the gutter . . . but , as soon as the couple have strolled onward , he discreetly retrieves it . I'll rate ' Crainquebille ' a perfect . Stay in Heidelberg , count !
418794	1609079	466399	10.0	' Ten Canoes ' rates a 10 !	SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . I saw ' Ten Canoes ' at Cannes , and I was absolutely awestruck . Even now , almost precisely a year later , I've difficulty writing about this film without being emotionally overcome . Yes , damn it , the movie's that good , that wonderful , that miraculous . I feel a deep attachment to this film and its subject matter . As you might guess from my email address - - Borroloola ( an aboriginal settlement in the Northern Territory ) - - I spent several of my formative years in Australia's outback , notably the Red Centre , Arunta and the Northern Territory , not far from where ' Ten Canoes ' was filmed . Although I'm white , I've been privileged to meet ( and live with ) members of several of the indigenous tribes from that part of Australia . The people in ' Ten Canoes ' ( both the actors and the roles they portray ) are of the Yolngu and Gunwinggu tribes , whereas most of my own friendships in that region are with members of the Nunggubuyu and Gunbalanya groups . All of these tribes are centred in the Arnhem Land region , so I recognised much of the land ( and language ) in this wonderful movie . I was surprised that this film's English title has a number in it , because the Arnhem Land natives did not use number words until recently . They quantify an object by naming it as many times as needed . For instance , the Nunggubuyu word for ' day ' is ' jami ' , so ' three days ' would be ' jami jami jami ' . This system works well enough for quantities of as many as five ( a hand's worth ) : for more than five of anything , they use a word for ' many ' . It turns out that the title ' Ten Canoes ' is largely irrelevant and mostly symbolic . Ten Yolngu warriors are on an expedition to steal goose eggs from their nests ( insert ' poached eggs ' joke here ) . To travel by water , the warriors must construct one canoe for each man . But in fact the title refers to the ten men themselves , or their physical bodies : vessels ( canoes ) in which their souls travel the ( river ) current of existence . ( The press kit at Cannes said that this film's title was inspired by a photograph : but that photo is never seen in this film . My own explanation fits the circumstances just as well . ) The film's narration by David Gulpilil is perfect . He speaks his lines in an accent containing just enough Strine to link the action to modern Australia without evoking Mick Dundee or any Ocker stereotypes . Several supernatural events occur during this film , but they're conveyed in native Australian terms , not Hollywood clichés . . . so , don't expect any CGI f / x mucking up this wonderful story . The beautiful photography is entirely at the service of native Australian story-telling techniques . Even the subtle manipulation of colour , which could have been just one more gimmick , adds a dimension to the narrative . The aboriginal actors , with their distinctive Dravidian facial structures , photograph astonishingly . Unfortunately for the film , one or two of them have modern dentition , spoiling the effect that we're witnessing events occurring thousands of years before white men's arrival in Australia . The main Gunwinggu character has a moustache just a bit too neatly trimmed . More favourably , I was delighted by a scene which shows ( accurately ) how these ancient men , who have no metal , are able to shave their beards . Very credibly , their preoccupations are much as we might expect : flatulence , sex , physical urges . Because I've done continuity work on several films , I compulsively check every movie I view ( and its soundtrack ) for continuity errors or anachronisms . As I watched and enjoyed ' Ten Canoes ' and the beautiful footage of Arnhem Land flora and fauna , I kept checking for jet contrails , rabbit fences , bird calls by imported species , or any other signs of modern life in this movie's depiction of dawntime Australia . The flawless teeth of a couple of the actors were the only flaws in this film . I wept with joy and delight at the beauty and narrative power of this unique and precious film . A rating of isn't good enough , but it'll have to do . If you have any passion at all for anything outside the usual Hollywood clichés , you must see ' Ten Canoes ' .
419453	1609079	364439	10.0	Astonishing tumbles , and one minor fumble .	Richard Risley Carlisle ( 1814-1874 ) was a circus performer from New Jersey who developed a type of acrobatic act which was such a clear innovation that , ever since , performers of similar acts have been known - - in arenas as diverse as circuses , American vaudeville and the British music-halls - - as ' Risley acrobats ' or ' a risley act ' ( not always upper-cased ) . Risley assembled a troupe billed as the Risley Family Acrobats , although it's likely that most ( or even all ) of his troupers were no relation to him . At least three of his apprentices went on to form their own risley troupes , each of them claiming the surname ' Risley ' as his own name . Professor Risley ( as he billed himself ) apparently achieved the peak of his fame in the early 1860s when he performed for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle . However , in 1864 he and his troupe performed in Yokohama , to great acclaim and the intense interest of his Japanese audiences . I've known about Professor Risley for decades . . . but , until I saw this film ' Japanese Acrobats ' , I'd no idea of precisely how great Risley's success in Japan was . Basically , a risley act - - I'm sure you've seen them - - begins with one man lying on his back with his legs upright . At appropriate moments , his arms are also upright . A smaller performer ( often a child ) performs various acrobatic manoeuvres while balancing on one or more of the ' anchor ' man's upraised feet and palms . It looks as if the tumbler up top is doing all the hard work : however , the man underneath is taking considerable risk ( if the tumbler falls on him ) , and - - more importantly - - the man underneath is expending quite a lot of energy himself , using the strength of his legs at strategic moments to propel the tumbler into the next handspring or aerial . In Frank Capra's film ' Rain or Shine ' , Joe Cook's dazzling display of circus skills includes a brief sample of risley acrobatics . I've seen several risley acts with a woman or a girl as the ' flyer ' ( up top ) , but the anchor beneath is traditionally a man . ' Japanese Acrobats ' is a 1904 Edison film preserved in the Library of Congress . I'm hugely interested in circus acts in general , and not least in ' foreign ' acts from cultures outside my own experience . I was expecting to see these acrobats performing some ancient Oriental balancing routine , utterly alien to my Occidental eyes . I was astounded to discover that this Edison film records a risley act , of precisely the sort which American and British acrobats of this same period were also performing . I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the risley act in this 1904 movie is a very , VERY good risley act : one of the best I've ever seen . Professor Risley must have made a very big impression in Japan indeed . In front of an elaborately painted backdrop , two performers enter and bow . The man looks about 20 years old , the boy about 12 . The man lies supine , and raises his legs . . . atop which the boy then performs some dazzling acrobatics . The man is not merely providing a platform for the boy : on several occasions their movements are carefully co-ordinated , such as when the boy lies flat on his back while the man pedals his feet rapidly to spin the boy horizontally . The boy is not passive here ; he must constantly shift his centre of gravity at the same speed as the man's foot movements . At another point , while the boy is still airborne , the man suddenly lowers one leg . . . forcing the boy to use only one of his own feet to land ( perfectly ! ) on the man's sole remaining sole , and to balance one-footed before springing into the next manoeuvre . I shudder to think of how many hours these two must have rehearsed together . I spotted only one slip-up , a minor one . Early in the film , the boy briefly shifts off balance , and the man instantly raises his arms to adjust him . This is done so swiftly and gracefully that most audiences would assume it was part of the act . At the successful conclusion , the two acrobats stand , bow and exit . . . then return to steal one more bow . Further proof that people are alike all over : Japanese vaudevillains are just as eager to steal a bow as their western counterparts . It was fairly common in vaudeville and in British and American circuses for Occidental ( white ) artistes to perform under Oriental names in exotic costumes : this was especially true for magicians and acrobats , so I would normally be suspicious if an allegedly Oriental act consisted solely of the very American risley repertory of acrobatics . . . even more so because there's an entire tradition of Chinese and Japanese acrobatics which owes nothing to western techniques . However , the two performers in this film do seem to be genuine Issei , or maybe Japanese-Americans . Sadly , acrobats have short careers . One advantage of risley acrobatics over the other techniques is that the performers tend to have longer careers . A boy starts out as the tumbler up top ; as he grows older and heavier , and attains more muscle mass , he moves down to the lower position , taking advantage of his increasing strength while using his experience to train a new ' flyer ' up top . ' Japanese Acrobats ' is a fascinating record of a classic circus technique ; ironically , these Oriental performers are documenting their discipline and skill in a circus art that was born and raised in America . My rating for this one : a perfect .
418237	1609079	970525	10.0	Good performances , twist ending	I started out disliking ' A Fitting Tribute ' because the premise reminded me of one of the most uncomfortable events in my adult life . In 1975 , I was a stringer for one of the Fleet Street tabloids . An attractive young heiress named Lesley Whittle was kidnapped and held to ransom by a psychopath who eventually murdered her . My editor ordered me to go to the Whittle home and obtain a photograph of the dead heiress , even though her grieving family presumably had other priorities at the moment . As I was leaving the editor's desk , he shouted after me : ' Try to get her in a swimming cozzie . ' Fortunately , ' A Fitting Tribute ' goes off in an entirely different direction from my own experiences on that unpleasant occasion . ' A Fitting Tribute ' begins in a rural cemetery , where we meet shrewish Tammy and gormless Niall . They get into a car , and Tammy drives while she harangues Niall . There's some plot exposition here , and director Daniel Cormack handles it expertly : he shoots close-ups of Tammy's eyes in the rear-view mirror ( presumably from Niall's P . O . V . ) while her off-screen voice delivers the set-up . Apparently Niall is a cub reporter , and Tammy ( a more experienced journo ) is ordering him to the home of a young man who has recently died in a road accident , with the objective of obtaining a photograph of the deceased . We never do learn why this young man is important enough to merit so much journalistic intrigue ; perhaps Tammy and Niall are working for a regional newspaper that specialises in local events . Niall goes to the house of Mrs Wright , the deceased's mother . Surprisingly enough , she lets him in and hears him out . What happens next is utterly unexpected , bizarre , yet believable . I shan't spoil the ending for you , except to say that it reminded me of Roald Dahl's classic story ' The Landlady ' . . . but with a far more benevolent fate befalling the young protagonist in this case . There's a darkly clever pun in this film's title : ' A Fitting Tribute ' . There are only three characters in this mini-drama ( we never do see the dead son ) , but all three actors give excellent well-modulated performances . As the grieving mother , April Nicholson could have brought her characterisation into bathos but blessedly never does so . It's early days yet for director Daniel Cormack , but he has already distinguished himself as a talented director , both in manipulating actors and in positioning the camera . Throughout ' A Fitting Tribute ' , his shot set-ups are spot-on and well-framed . I'll rate this clever drama a full .
419694	1609079	40481	10.0	Bit o ' bovver in Bethnal .	Googie Withers was England's equivalent of Joan Blondell ( although better-looking and more talented ) : both actresses played similar types , alternating their performances between dramas and comedies . In ' It Always Rains on Sunday ' , Withers gives possibly the best performance of her career . She's skilfully abetted by a universally excellent cast . This is a taut thriller , very much in the Hitchcock vein , based on a novel by Arthur La Bern . ( His novel ' Goodbye Piccadilly , Farewell Leicester Square ' , set in Covent Garden in this same time period , was updated by Hitchcock as the basis for ' Frenzy ' . ) The lives ( and a death ) of several people in London's East End are deftly interwoven . A real strength of this drama is its perfect encapsulation of a distinctive time and place in one London neighbourhood : Bethnal Green and its environs . The dialogue is note-perfect , although Americans will want subtitles for such terms as " have a butcher's " ( take a look ) , " sweet Fannie Adams " ( not a bloody thing ) , " Bob's your uncle " ( you're all set ) , " shopped " ( informed upon ) , " clothes " ( blankets ) and " the Anderson " ( a mass-produced prefabricated outdoor shelter during the Blitz , employed as garden sheds after the war ) . I was even impressed that the scriptwriters caught the East Enders ' subtle distinction between " up west " ( the West End ) and " out west " ( the Home Provinces ) . That Anderson shelter , Mrs Spry's doss-house , the ration book , the police call-box with Albertus panels ( from the pre-999 era of Whitehall 1212 ) , the wide boys and the spivs ( notably the splendid John Slater ) all gave me a twinge of nostalgia . SLIGHT SPOILER . The climactic chase is thrilling and well done , except for two shots using miniatures that are laughably obvious . American viewers might wonder why the plainclothesmen don't just simply shoot the fugitive . ( When this film was made , British police never carried firearms except in very unusual circumstances . ) I did notice a few minor errors , including some tech errors . Only two years after V-E Day , with rationing still in place , it's very unlikely that so many working-class Englishwomen would have such elaborate make-up . ( Get a line on those carefully pencilled eyebrows ! ) Spivs or no spivs : how did so many of these characters get such elaborate and expensive leather gloves ? And , drunk or not : would Vi ( Susan Shaw ) really go straight into bed without removing her make-up and her expensive frock ? ' It Always Rains on Sunday ' brilliantly preserves life in Bethnal Green in the late years of George VI's reign . . . and also tells a cracking good suspense yarn . My rating for this one : despite a few flaws , a perfect .
