526114	4445210	69704	1.0	Bad Then , Even Worse Now	I know a lot of people loved this movie , right from the start when they first saw it in the early 1970s at the theaters . I hated it then , and I hated it 25 years later when I gave it another chance on VHS . It was even worse now because you added " dated " to this list of negative adjectives describing this movie . Stories about teenage jerks are not what I call entertaining . The only thing worse than the usual " coming of age " movie is one that involves the kids of the 1960s , the worst decade in American history . Ron Howard and Cindy Williams played pretty decent kids but nerd-looking Charles Martin Smith and friend Paul LeMat were super annoying . I didn't appreciate the language in here , either . I didn't expect The Mickey Mouse Club or Opie from Mayberry , but six usages of the Lord's name in vain in the first half hour along with a bunch of other profanities didn't turn me on to this " comedy . " I also didn't get any laughs , either . Was this supposed to be a comedy ? I hope not . Nothing much happens anyway , just the life of these dorks who drive around all night trying to impress bimbos . Wow , this is " deep . " . The only enjoyment I got out of this film was listening to the voice of " Wolfman Jack , " the legendary rock deejay .
525537	4445210	175142	1.0	Another Sad Example Of Today's Comedies	Here's yet one more example of a modern-day comedy that has its funny moments but unfortunately , to me , was more of a sleaze-fest that a parody or a straight comedy . This movie is spoofing horror films . That's cool , I like a good spoof , but why all the irreverence and sex jokes ? Why is that necessary ? Don't writers today have the intelligence to make people laugh using clean material ? This is just one R-rated scene after another . The language is brutal , too : tons of profanity in this film . Funny , but comedies for years made the public laugh without having to resort to profanity and sex remarks , like this film does . The really sickening part is that movie was geared for a young audience . The film business has no shame . What passes for comedy films today is , by and large , low-class material . This movie is Exhibit A .
527273	4445210	114069	1.0	Over-hyped Insult To Anyone Of Intelligence	I remember this film getting a lot of hype before it came out . You could see advertisements promoting it all over television for a few weeks . Well , I got sucked in and was anxious to see it , myself . As usual , it didn't live up to the hype . It wasn't bad ; just not as good as I had hoped . One thing that turned me off was the typical government-is-the-bad guy storyline again . Holy smokes - isn't this getting a bit tiresome , especially by an industry which makes billions of dollars in this country ? ( Nothing like a grateful attitude and true patriotism - that's today's left-wing world of film . ) ' It's not good to kill the trees , " says another eco-nut who traces the U . S . ' s mistakes in attempting to wipe out an Africa virus . Of course , if the military had hugged the trees , none of this human carnage would have happened ! Really ? Dustin Hoffman , Kevin Spacey , Morgan Freeman , Donald Sutherland and Rene Russo are old hands at playing in slanted political stories . The left-wing slants in this film keep coming , just like the plague : reverse-racism ( a General who's conscience doesn't agree with his government is naturally a black man . The villain military guy , naturally , is the Caucasian . When have you ever seen the reverse ? It's always the same in modern-day films . Look it up . In addition , we get more Hollywood clichés at the end with the typical overdone chase scene , which is so stupid I just laughed out loud at parts of it . Entertaining ? Yes . An insult to anyone's intelligence ? Oh , yeah !
523372	4445210	120889	1.0	About As Stupid & Insultng As It Gets	What a disappointment . As someone who loves unique visuals , great color , I was led to believe in previews that the super visual aspect of this movie would be major part of it - that this was going to be like nothing you ever seen ! Well , some parts were , but precious few . What dominated , instead , was one of the dumbest stories and theologically - insulting ones to anyone who has any Biblical knowledge I have ever seen . I have should have known Hollywood would invent their own strange and weird version of heaven and hell . It's sad so many ignorant people buy into whatever Hollywood puts up on a big screen as being Truth , when it's usually the opposite they are seeing and hearing . This movie is a perfect example . Suffice to say , without going into all the details , people are using the Lord's name in vain in heaven ; God is mentioned only once and that of a " distant " person " somewhere up there " and the main theology preached is re - incarnation . Secular humanism also is prevalent and in this movie , if you set your mind to it , you can bring your loved ones up from hell to heaven ! Wow , who needs Jesus ? Not people in the film world , that's for sure . No wonder this film bombed . Even the agnostics and atheists who are our national film critics knew this movie was stupid .
525332	4445210	802016	1.0	What Was The Purpose Of This ' Tour ? '	This was the first time I've been very disappointed with one of Justine Shapiro's " tours " in these " Globe-Trekker " DVDs . This was a disgrace . Shapiro normally is a lot more mature than what she demonstrated here . She came with an " attitude " and showed unbelievable poor taste , as did the people who put this together . I watched this - as I presume most other people did - to see the magnificent Southwest scenery , particularly the Grand Canyon , not have most it ignored in favor of showing us scene after scene of whacked out New Agers , psychics , aged hippies from the ' 60s , alien space worshipers , on and on - all of which seemed to turn on our young host . Shapiro - I am not exaggerating - showed exactly 5-7 seconds of the Grand Canyon from her helicopter ride . That was it ! The most magnificent , famous sight probably in all of the U . S . and that's what we got . Meanwhile , we were " treated " to minutes and minutes of a " channeling " session , UFO discussions , naked men with their penises hanging out dancing around a bonfire , etc . In addition , the first 20 minutes of this 50-minute show , Shapiro did nothing but complain about everything . She didn't like a hotel , her car ride , she complained about certain things in the Amtrak ride , she totally trashed the city of Sante Fe . . . . . she didn't like anything . She didn't disguise her attitude or ignorance , right from the opening sentence of the show . She said , " I really was never interesting in coming here . I thought the only scenery worthwhile was outside the country . " Oh , really ! Never thought the Grand Canyon was anything worth seeing or the U . S had nothing to offer ? I guess that sort gives you an idea how bad this episode was , and the producers ought to be ashamed putting out a " travel " disc like this . Since a British company makes these , maybe this is another form of USA-bashing . All this turned out to be was a San Francisco wacko with a real elitist attitude showing us what interested her , not the audience .
526865	4445210	105017	2.0	I Never Did Like John Ritter	This was supposed to be " a hilarious farce , " according to reviews of the day . It just shows you how unreliable are the movie critics you read in the newspaper . The only " farce " was that this film was lauded . The first dozen minutes along totally turned me off . In that period . John Ritter used the Lord's name in vain at least three times . That , and hundred of other " Oh , God " this and " Oh , God " that were just way too much and too annoying . I usually like Michael Caine but he's had his share of lemons , as other actors have , and this is one of them . Add in the usually-annoying Carol Burnett , Julie Hagerty and Ritter and this is easy movie to dislike . From what I hear , the stage play was far better than this flat farce .
527281	4445210	44953	2.0	Ryan's Laugh Was Stupid & Ruined The Film	Why one famous critic called this " possibly the greatest Western ever made " is mind - boggling . Not only is it NOT that , it's not even a good movie . In fact , it stinks ! The first 15 minutes leads you to believe this might be a great western , but by halfway through this yawner I had lost my interest . . . . both times I tried . Yeah , I gave it two attempts . What ruined the film ? Robert Ryan's laugh . Ryan , playing his usual villain role , laughed every time he talked . At first , that was kind of different and almost fun to hear but , man , did that wear thin quickly . In no time , Ryan got so annoying to hear that any pleasure from watching this movie was disappearing fast . The sad thing was the rest of the attractive cast was comprised on unlikeable characters , too ! You would think you could root for someone here . Whether it was James Stewart , Janet Leigh or Ralph Meeker playing a character , there wasn't a " good guy " in the bunch . There are hundreds of westerns better than this one .
523426	4445210	443649	3.0	Yeah , It's True What They Are Writing Here	I was hoping to like this movie , to give it a better review than most might give it . . . . but I couldn't . In the end , I had to agree with the reviewers here on IMDb , that this movie stinks . It's true . It's also one of those films that starts off okay , lures you in , and then deteriorates . With 40 minutes to go in the two-hour film , you're ready to walk out but since you've invested 80 minutes you figure , " I might as well see it through the end . " The last half hour then becomes like a session at the dentist's office in which you can't wait for the experience to be over . Credibility is probably the worst aspect of this film . Seeing people 10 , 000 years ago in buildings that look pretty well-made and would do an architect proud today , and hearing people speak with British and other assorted accents - in the same tribe - for the time and place ( Mideast or Northern Africa in 10 , 000 B . C . ) almost makes one laugh out loud in spots . . . . . yet this is supposed to be a serious movie . The special-effects were weak , especially with the saber-toothed tiger which not only looks very fake but is proportionally ludicrous . The mammoths didn't look at hokey , but they moved very woodenly , computer-like . This was mainly the reason I watched . I knew it might be stupid but I thought it might at least be fun with eye-popping effects . No , nothing was eye-popping here . It was just dumb . . . . and I didn't even get to the story part , if you want to call it that . Actually , that was the worst part of this film . The screenplay was embarrassingly bad . If you want details on the holes in this story and all the things that were impossible but shown here , check out the other reviews . Folks : you can believe all the negative reviews here on IMDb . They are not lying .
527572	4445210	25382	3.0	What Was The Point Of This Popeye Sing-Å-Long ?	This early Popeye cartoon is not the normal fare for him . You know that when you first discover this is only two minutes long ! After we see the sailor man exhibit his strength on-board a ship , as he sings , it turns into a sing-a-long for all of us . " Sing along we me , " Popeye exhorts and the screen turns black with the lyrics printed and , yes , we are to follow the bouncing ball . " I'm Popeye The Sailor Man ( toot ) I'm Popeye The Sailor Man ( toot ) I Am What I Am And That's All What I Yam I'm Popeye The Sailor Man ( toot , toot ) " We then get other verses which are unfamiliar but uninteresting . I don't know what the point of this was outside of introducing this cartoon character to audiences , although I am pretty sure Popeye cartoons began the year before in 1933 .
526280	4445210	44533	3.0	Very Disappointing Considering The Cast	A big disappointment , this " save the newspaper story with one big expose against a corrupt politician " was boring - the ultimate sin in a film . Also , I found none of the characters likable : no one to root for , despite the presence of some famous actors I like . The cast includes Humphrey Bogart , Ethel Barrymore , Kim Hunter , Ed Begley , Warren Stevens and Jim Backus . Most of them simply talk too much and do too little . It also has a blasphemous scene early on when they hold a " wake " for the paper and smugly use Christian terms ( i . e . " saved " ) irreverently , just to get some cheap laughs . I'm surprised they got away with this since the Hays Code was still very much in effect in 1952 .
526444	4445210	35646	4.0	A Weak Start To This Short Series	Well , after reading a couple of the other reviews here , I feel a little better . I thought maybe I missed something , thinking this animated short was pretty weak . Apparently , others agree . It might have been a landmark of sorts with the introduction of Claude The Cat and the two mice , Hubie ( his name wasn't mentioned in this cartoon ) and Bertie , but that doesn't mean it was entertaining . It wasn't , except for some of the artwork . This was the first of seven " Hubie and Bertie " cartoons . Claude was just not-funny stupid , and sadistic . Forced to fend for himself after " Meadows " the butler quits after being abused by the cat , Claude finds himself clueless . He has no idea how to do anything for himself . Apparently he doesn't even know what a mouse or a dog looks like , despite the fact there is a dog in the house . When he encounters the mice , he is scared out of his mind and runs for the hills . Finally , he winds up talking to them and they take advantage of the situation . Overall , this offers almost nothing in the way of laughs except one quick scene when Claude first meets the bulldog , face-to-face .
526142	4445210	36264	4.0	Dancing To The Music Not Really Funny	" This is our interpretation of the familiar tale of ' The Big Bad Wolf And The Three Little Pigs . ' " An announcer is telling this to an audience , of which we are privy . He adds this story " is set to the delightful music of Joann Brahm's ' Hungarian Dances . ' " So that's what we get : this fairy tale set to music . The announcer , butchering Brahms ' name , is funny , but not a lot of other things are in here . In fact , that might be it . What you mainly have here is a cartoon in which the actions of the people , from walking to dancing and prancing to the wolf chasing the pigs all is set to the music . Maybe it's just me , but I prefer humor in my cartoons . This was not something I'd watch again .
526427	4445210	120885	4.0	Prophetic , But Predictably Prejudiced	This movie tells the story of " spin doctors " who create a diversion to get heat off the President of the U . S . In this case , the President was accused of having sex with a young girl in the White House ( ironically , this was made before the Monica Lewinsky-Bill Clinton affair ! ) so a spin doctor - played by Robert De Niro - is hired to find a way out of the predicament before election day . His answer is to create a fake war with Albania . Lest you think this is the rarest of all Hollywood films - anti-Democrat , or even politically impartial story - no , it stays true to form by making disparaging remarks only about Conservatives ( Reagan , Bush , Nixon , etc . ) . There is nothing said about Liberals / Democrats , of course . Don't hold your breath ever waiting for impartiality from the film world or the media . Note : There are a lot of f-words in here , for those who are offended by that . Otherwise , it's a talky movie in general , much like a play , and it's too talky . That may be the main reason this movie was not a box-office success .
526980	4445210	24824	4.0	Great Ending , But Not Worth Your Time Overall	Buster Keaton plays a guy who runs " " Ye Old Clockee Shoppe " and one wonders how he can stay in business since he's completely inept at fixing timepieces . This film starts off very slowly . , taking almost half of the total time to just to set up the premise of Buster trying to win the affections of Dorothy Sebastian over a rival , played by George J . Lewis . . " Elmer " ( Keaton ) is enamored with " Paula " ( Sebastian ) the moment she walks into his shop , and the two play off each other with mild and drawn-out slapstick gags , none of which are really that funny , to be honest . After nine-and-a-half minutes , the action perks up a bit as Buster takes her to the circus on a date . Unfortunately , she's immediately taken by the trapeze artist . Poor Buster ; he can't catch a break . . She asks Buster - rather tells him - to go get an autograph from the trapeze artist who tells him , " tell the woman to come by herself . If she's good-looking , maybe I'll give her my autograph . " That tells you what kind of jerk " Apollo The Wonderful " is , which makes " Elmer " look all the better . The best parts of the film are all in the last 6-7 minutes with Buster attempting to learn how to be a trapeze artist by rigging up things in his backyard . . . . . with humorous results . The ending - the final 2-3 minutes - is almost shocking because it becomes very dramatic with Buster's lady-friend trapped in a deadly fire . . . . and you - - know-who turns out to be the hero ! I mention the end , with the spoilers alert , rather than not say anything only to warn you this really isn't a good Buster Keaton film to watch . You are far , far better off watching one of his silent films where he exhibits his comic genius . He only does that in here in those final few minutes .
525987	4445210	105151	5.0	Insider's Jokes Don't Necessarily Connect With General Audience	A ton of celebrity cameos was the main thing that made this movie fun to watch , but once was enough . I wouldn't watch it again because there simply aren't enough " good guys " to suit me . The film is entertaining but has too nasty a tone to it . The language was rougher than it needed to be , but that's no surprise when you have Tim Robbins and Whoopi Goldberg starring . The story gives a look at many of the shallow people who run Hollywood . That automatically earns high praise from national film critics . Despite their innate love of Hollywood and films they somehow always love it when a film trashes the business ! Go figure . This black comedy mainly spoofs film executives . The filming is different in that you see one long scene with the camera on a crane taking turns following different people . Some of that is very clever , like the story , but I found a general smugness in this film that bordered on hypocrisy . The people who made this sometimes come off - through the film - like the folks they're criticizing . . . . . if that makes sense . Robbins is good at coming across as smug . . . . almost too good . It seems natural for him . ( I can say the same about Chevy Chase and his roles . ) Also , I find most films about Hollywood like this one : too much an inside joke for us non-film folks to really enjoy . It's like they made this film for themselves . I'm not surprised this movie was a box-office dud , since I don't think they really cared what the average guy in the seats thought about it - only their film peers .
525215	4445210	52603	5.0	Unique , But Not That Funny	Bugs is the guest conductor of the Warner Brothers Symphony Orchestra , playing " Morning , Noon and Night in Vienna by Franz Von Suppe . " The whole cartoon is a spoof of overly-dramatic conductors . Bugs exaggerates most of his moves with the orchestra delivering what he's doing . Some of it is funny , some too far - fetched , but that was the idea . Also , the music cleverly also was in sync with little things happening to Bugs ' apparel as it fell off here and there , giving him problems . In all , this short is more clever than it is funny . It's definitely a unique one for Bugs Money and I give them an " A " for originality but a " D " for laughs . Since most of us watch these animations for laughs , clever-or-not this was not up to par .
522632	4445210	147568	5.0	' Ol Man Winter Gets Buzzed	Overall , this was a decent cartoon , nothing extraordinary but one that had some very good individual moments . You'd see something really cool , and then not much would happen for a minute or two and then something dramatic and fascinating would be shown again . The artwork in the beginning was original with trees slowing turning into sexy shapes of dancing women . We see minotaurs ( half bull-half man Greek mythological creatures ) playing polo and everyone is happy that winter has been changed to summer . However , a violent and nasty ' Ol Man Winter returns and the only way to stop him was bees ! Huh ? Hey , it's a cartoon . This cartoon was viewed on a DVD called " Cartoons That Time Forget : The UB Iwerks Collection Vol . 1 . "
525287	4445210	26197	5.0	The Good & Bad Of ' Charlie Chan In Egypt '	I did not like this one on the first viewing , but I had a very bad tape which didn't help . With the DVD ( part of recent Chan Collection that came out in 2006 ) I enjoyed this more , thanks , in part to have the option of English subtitles . I still think this is a slightly sub-par Warner Oland-edition Charlie Chan , but only because I think so highly of the other films . It did have some excellent suspense and strange characters and is known because of the appearance of young Rita Cansino who would go on to star status as Rita Hayworth . THE BAD - None of Charlie's kids are here to help him out , and that's a loss . Instead , for humor , we have Stepin Fetchit with his mumbling drawl and unfunny character ( unlike Mantan Moreland in later Chans , even though both are horrible black stereotypes of the day . ) Worse than the above , we have a shrill , hysterical female lead character , " Carol Arnold " ( Pat Paterson ) who got on my nerves , big-time ! That's almost another stereotype of the period : women who fall apart easily and act like overemotional cripples . After a few of these outbursts , I just hit the mute button when she went into her act . She had a brother in here who was almost as bad except he had far fewer lines . Also in here was the typical thing you saw more of in the ' 30s than in modern films : stories that dealt with the occult and a lot of superstitions . THE GOOD - The action was pretty good and this story gave us more of the weird suspects than what is normally provided . Not only weird people but strange scenes . Combine those with the usual Chan witticism's , profound statements and uncommon courtesy he gives everyone , and it's an entertaining film . I would never have recognized Hayworth if I hadn't been informed it was her . She played a dark-haired Egyptian woman . If you froze some frames and looked carefully enough , you could be convinced it was her , but it wasn't easy . She certainly wasn't the incredible beauty she would be in the next decade .
524630	4445210	43733	5.0	Okay , But Certainly Not One Of Hope's Best	This was fairly interesting story with some decent laughs . . . . nothing to really dislike but nothing that would make rush out and buy the film , either . The characters were colorful in here and Bob Hope ( it's his movie ) had a number of funny lines , yet I didn't think the film moved that fast for some reason . Although not considered a musical , there were several songs in here by Hope and Marilyn Maxwell , none memorable . It did have a decent cast with name actors such as Lloyd Nolan and Jane Darwell and a bunch of ' character actors ' like Ben Weldon , Jay C . Flippen , Sid Melton and William Frawley ( of " I Love Lucy " fame ) . Overall , I wouldn't spend more than a dollar to rent it .
527083	4445210	35814	5.0	Helium-Filled Moe Highlights This So-So Effort	The boys must produce a new " revolutionary " airplane , as promised , or they will be drafted into the military . This " short " has the semi-famous Moe-as-a-big black-balloon skit in which he first floats to the top of the room and eventually out a skylight window has to be shot out of the sky by Curly . It takes just over half the movie for the " Wrong Brothers " to get their plane , " The Buzzard , " out of the hangar . Before that are bunch of verbal jokes and a lot of slapstick where the guys take turns taking a beating from something or someone . There's the old " Oh , oh , oh . . . . . . oh , look " as we see the blades of saw all ruined after they were used on his head . That sort of thing . With all three of these bozos in the small cockpit as the same time , you know their flight is going to wind up a disaster . I was disappointed , however , to see the final three minutes is not original , a scene from a previous Stooges film called " Boobs In Arms . " There is no need for that kind of cheapness from Columbia Pictures . If you like the Three Stooges , you'll like this because it incorporates most of their sight gags and slapstick all within a 17-minute time frame , even if that last part is a " repeat , " which still is inexcusable and makes me downgrade my final rating of this .
525529	4445210	113552	5.0	Okay , But Just Too Hard , Too Nasty For Most People	This is not the 1947 film but a 1995 re-make of the famous gangster flick of the same name . While the classic film had one brutally nasty guy , this one has a whole cast full of them . . . . too nasty , frankly . I watched this once and was fairly interested in it . A couple of years later , took a second look and found it so sleazy and I couldn't finish it . David Caruso , who obtained a lot more fame in television shows than movies , still was interesting for me to watch as he played Victor Mature's old role . Caruso is one of the better actors I've seen when it comes to expressing his emotions just by his facial looks . It seems fashionable to knock him , but I've always been a fan of his work . Nicholas Cage plays Richard Widmark's psycho character " Tommy Udo " but is called " Little Junior Brown " in this film . Personally , I liked Widmark's performance and character much more . A lot of people , especially 20-somethings , like these modern tough films with brutal characters and tons of profanity , but the characters in this movie were so nasty that the film never really caught on with anybody . It certainly had one thing going for it : a very good cast that also included Samuel L . Jackson , Michael Rapaport , Ving Rhames , Stanley Tuccki , Helen Hunt and Kathryn Erbe . To summarize : it's not that bad : it just has too hard an edge to it .
522448	4445210	35583	5.0	Yes , Rita Never Looked Lovelier , But Story Was Never As Stupid !	Boy , here we go again . It's too bad they had to have just stupid stories in these Fred Astaire movies , especially with the gorgeous and talented Rita Hayworth as his partner . Ginger Rogers was great in her roles as Astaire's most-often dance partner but nobody looked as awesome as Hayworth in the early-to-mid ' 40s . In one of the numbers here , she wears a short mini-type skirt so you also get to enjoy her great legs . Her dance scenes with Astaire are almost worth the price of the film . I say " almost " because , as usual , the story was stupid , insulting anyone's intelligence and not fun to watch . Adolphe Menjou spent the entire movie being gruff and crabby , anything but entertaining . The romance angle was typical for it's film era , which is not a compliment . Just fast-forward to the dance scenes and you have a film that's watchable .
524414	4445210	43128	5.0	The Interesting-But Not-That-Funny History Of Bugs Bunny	This is a bit different from most Bugs Bunny cartoons : the life story of Bugs , from when he knew he was " a bit different " ( the rest of the babies were humans and he was a rabbit ) to his beginnings in the world of show business . However , the latter doesn't pan out . Bugs is down on his luck and moping around on a park bench , when Elmer Fudd passes by and says , " Why are you hanging around with these guys ? They'll never amount to anything . " ( They are Al Jolson , Jack Benny , Eddie Cantor and Bing Crosby ! ) Elmer gets him a job back in the theater . The vaudeville show opens in Peoria ( where else ? ) . It travels on to Buffalo and then New York City , but Bugs is getting bugged . He's tired of being Elmer's foil and getting pies shoved in his face , etc . He reverses the act and finishes with " What's up , doc ? " It's a smash ! Offers come in from everywhere and the two head off to Hollywood and Warner Brothers . The rest is history . There are not a lot of laughs in here : very few , in fact , but it's fairly interesting . This is good for one viewing only , unless you're a big fan or a collector of BB cartoons , then it might be of historical significance .
523507	4445210	52948	5.0	Fun In ' 59 , Still Okay , But Really Dated In Spots	This was very exciting when I was a kid in the late ' 50s but not so much now as an older guy . That about sums it up but it's not a surprise : a film that relies on special effects will almost always be dated very quickly . This movie is about 50 years old , so it is certainly understandable if this is far from as thrilling as it was when it came out on the big screen . ( This was pre-VHS era , too , so you could only see this on a big screen , which was actually a good thing . ) That's not to say you couldn't enjoy the movie today . Jules Verne stories were big-time in the 1950s and 60s , too , with " The Time Machine ( 1953 ) and 20 , 000 Leagues Under The sea ( 1954 ) . Around The World In Eighty Days ( 1956 ) James Mason played the lead in two of this films : this one , and 20 , 000 Leagues He plays the passionate scientist role effectively in both . If you've read Verne's novel , however , be prepared to see the opposition . Verne's book is dark ; this movie is colorful . Watching this film , it's also hard to buy a professor of geology ( " Sir Oliver Lindenbrook , " played by Mason ) and a singing student ( Pat Boone , as " Alec McKuen " ) finding things they found in the center of the earth in this movie . This is like watching those corny sci-fi " B " films of the ' 50s , except it's a major studio spending big bucks . Yet I can't really mock this effort because it does entertain and did especially 50 years ago , providing wonderful escapism for a couple of hours . However , two warnings : ( 1 ) the special - effects are terribly dated : ( 2 ) like a lot of classic-era films , you have to have a lot of a patience because things really don't start to get exciting until almost the halfway point . Today's audiences , including me , might be getting too restless by then to keep enough interest to watch the entire 132 minutes . You have to stay with it . If does get interesting , despite being totally implausible in many areas ( phony accents , how much light there is in the depths of the earth , etc . )
524306	4445210	60165	5.0	Too Drawn Out , Needs A Re-Make	The first 40 to 50 minutes of this movie was very interesting , but after that it dragged and never really recovered for me . They just went on and on and on between the time Henry Fonda's " Meredith " fell " ill " and the time the big poker hand was consummated - over half the film waiting to see what happened ! It was frustrating and ridiculous . The ending is neat , if you don't know there's going to be a big surprise . If you it , and I was tipped off , it's easy to spot and ruins some of the ending , although there is another twist added . All that was cool but it took far too long to get to that point . Today's audiences would never stand for something to be drawn out that long . Now that poker has become such a big game , I'd like to see this re-made but with a much tighter script .
523590	4445210	112818	6.0	Talk About " Playing Against Type ! "	Susan Sarandon playing a nun ? Sure . Only in the land of make-believe , meaning Hollywood or any other movie setting . Well , at least she's being somewhat true to her beliefs - not religion , of course , but a Liberal cause : being anti-death penalty . That's no surprise , especially with boyfriend and fellow ultra-Liberal Tim Robbins directing the picture . Sarandon , however , does an excellent job in the role of " Sister Helen Prejean . " The same holds true for Sean Penn , who plays sleazy murderer " Matthew Poncelet . " Well , at the sleazy part was more believable from him , but he's a great actor anyway . It's a well-told , powerful story and I really appreciated the soundtrack . There is some great music in here . This is a not a faithful adaptation of the book , as some have said here . A big part of the book by the real Sister Prejean is the Christian forgiveness exhibited by one of the families of the murdered victims , but that is never mentioned in the movie .
525649	4445210	420740	6.0	Filmed In Iceland , This Is Intriguing , But Ending Hurts It	This was an intriguing , although not satisfying , , movie and one I still felt was worth my few bucks I paid to rent it . It was filmed in Iceland - one of the few films I've heard of with that locale - but the story in the film takes place somewhere in Midwestern America . I knew that going in , so it made it kind of strange to view , in that respect . However , the story seemed very realistic . In parts , it almost felt like a documentary , it was so real and atmospheric . However , as much as I enjoyed the movie , and particularly Forest Whitaker with his odd accent , the ending was a big disappointment . The film had so much promise up until then . Some people say this film had the feel of a Coen Brothers movie , and I agree with that . To some , this might also have been a bit slow or boring but I thought it had unique atmosphere to it . With a more satisfying ending , I would have bought the DVD and watched it several more times .
527110	4445210	303849	6.0	Cathedral Best Part Of The Show	This was a concert in Montreal's impressive Notre Dame Cathedral . ' Impressive ' might be understating it since this church is the most spectacular I have ever seen . I'd love to see it in person . However , after the viewer has examined the magnificent cathedral , the visuals are nothing special - just shots of Luciano Pavarotti singing . The camera shots don't keep it interesting and could use the rest of it as background music while you do something else . From what I've seen , I'd take the Andrea Bocelli DVDs over this . You get a similar great voice and better visuals . The latter is why we get concerts on DVD ; otherwise just stick with a CD .
522298	4445210	35664	6.0	An Unusual War Movie	For a war movie , this was a bit unusual in that almost the whole film took part in one place . You could almost make a play out of this . A group of men stay in one area trying to sabotage a bridge so the Japanese can't use it to transport supplies . Meanwhile , they have to fend off attacks by the enemy . The closing scenes feature that attack and some are quite brutal . At least half of the story is not action but melodramatic looks at the soldiers , particularly of the squad's sergeant leader Robert Taylor and one of his men who has an attitude problem : Lloyd Nolan . We also get some shorter profiles of combat men played by Robert Walker , Thomas Mitchell and Desi Arnez ( yes , Lucy's husband ) . The special effects are more than passable considering they weren't too advanced in the film industry compared to today's technology . However , credibility was a little thin as those Japanese soldiers died awfully fast in those combat scenes at the end . I swear I saw several of them drop over before anyone hit them ! Taylor was the best in this movie " army " and Walker was the annoying character , playing an extremely young and generally stupid Navy guy ( don't ask ) who never stopped talking in this irritating voice . Other than his character , this was a tough , no-nonsense war movie .
526848	4445210	35549	6.0	' We Don't Wanna Seista ; We Wanna See Delores ! "	It's those kind of puns in the subject head above that make this Stooges-in-Mexico short humorous at times , but overall it is not one of their more memorable movies although it could have been given the Mexican locale . Mostly it's just the normal Moe sticking his figures in Curly's eyes type slapstick . The skit in which the boys have no clue what the Mexican is saying because he speaks Spanish is lame and goes on too long . Suzanne Kaaren as " Dolores Sanchez , " was pretty ; kind of a poor man's Rita Hayworth with her hairstyle , body and looks . She was offered a role as a Ziegfield girl at the tender age of 15 , and then later had her legs insured for a million bucks . . . . . so the Rita Hayworth comparison wasn't exaggerated , although Rita was . . . . . . . well , Rita . I was hoping the bullfight scenes at the end of this Stooges short would be hilarious but they were only so-so , and should have been funnier . Overall , this was okay - I did laugh out loud a few times - but not one of the more laugh-producing shorts the boys made over the years .
526231	4445210	94608	6.0	Memorable , But Not Oscar-Worthy	I remember this being somewhat of a controversial film when it came out , probably because the rape scene was too graphic for many people . The subject of rape , in itself , is not new to films so it must have been the way it was presented . ( I am writing this from memory . ) I do remember the scene as extremely uncomfortable to watch . In a nutshell , Jodie Foster plays a woman , " Sarah Tobias " who goes looking for trouble in a bar and gets much more than she bargained for , being gang-raped on top of a pinball machine . She then goes to court to prosecute the men involved . This was an out-and-out " women's lib movie " and since they are given favorable press by the politically-correct media , the film got extra publicity . Even for feminists , though , this story has too many holes in it to be as credible as we would like it to be . The had a female prosecutor , of course , and Kelly McGillis just didn't cut it in that role , just not convincing . Also , with Hollywood , when you hear " based " on a true story , you know facts will be few and far between and the dramatic parts will be very exaggerated . None of this implies , by the way , that the victim deserved what she got . In fact , I hope some women learned from this movie and never put themselves in a spot where something horrific like this could happen . Alcohol and sex desires are a lethal combination and a bar with a number of drunks is not where you want to start arousing people . Jodie Foster is a fine actress but I did question her winning an Oscar over this . Too much of the Academy Awards in the last two decades have become nothing but political forums ( always favoring the latest left wing cause ) . In this case , the feminists were appeased . Foster has done better work in other films and not been recognized . Overall , I think this film is good for one viewing but a little too unpleasant for more than that .
526859	4445210	60397	6.0	This Special-Effects Film Needs A Re-Make	I found this very interesting in parts and very boring in others . . . . and that was awhile ago . With today's faster-paced movies , I would probably find this too much on the boring side today . The same holds true for the special effects : great in its day , nothing that much today . This movie features a well-known cast but feels like a ' B ' science-fiction film . A couple of decades later , they made another version of this called " Inner Space , " and that was more interesting . I think another re-make would be appropriate about now in the mid 2000s . With today's technology , it would look spectacular . That's the problem with movies that rely heavily on special effects : they get dated quickly . This movie might have been " fantastic " in the mid ' 60s , but not now .
526959	4445210	51337	6.0	Dumb & Dated . . . . But Love Those Skeletons and Special-Effects !	Wow , does this movie had incredibly stupid dialog ! This is a Class B film with , yes , a capital ' B ' but it was still fun to watch , thanks to a decent amount of action and the special-effects . The latter were done by the famous Ray Harryhausen and many think this is his greatest work . They were great in its day but are dated now . However , you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of watching this and that especially goes for kids . Nevertheless , it ; s almost a " campy " kind of picture . . . . so corny it's good for the adults . The fighting skeletons ( from Jason & The Argonauts , this being the same type of thing ) are still fun to watch and seems to be the trademark of these Harryhausen mythical films . Kathryn Grant , meanwhile , provides the female beauty . Kerwin Mathews , Richard Eyer and Torin Thather are the male leads . Lots of big names , eh ? ?
524917	4445210	86373	6.0	Hosers Get A Bit Repetitive , Eh ?	Boy , this was a fun movie to watch once , at least for me . Additional viewings just didn't have the comedic effect that first one did . It's like good beer that has gone flat . Maybe because by the second viewing I knew I was going to hear " eh " 5 , 000 times and " hoser " about 500 times . It's fnny at first , but gets a little too annoyingly repetitive after that . It's like , " Ok , we get the joke ! " The movie starts off funny , somewhat of a forerunner of a Wayne's World flick with the boys pretending to be in a film or on TV . Here , the two " stars " are Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas , both of whom make light of a couple Canadian guys who love their beer , and little else . Everyone is a " hoser " and every sentence ends in " eh ? " Actually , as one who lives close to the border and has been in Canada many times , I laughed at that stuff on the first viewing . However , that - and the lame gags in here - got just too stupid and plain dumb on subsequent viewings . Yes , I even gave this a third look about a month ago , but only lasted about a half hour . I canned the tape and " cracked open a cold one - a beer not mentioned in the movie but a big favorite around these parts : a Labatt's Blue . It was a lot better than the film .
525861	4445210	59800	6.0	A Real Mixed Bag Of Good & Bad	A typical early James Bond movie , filled with beautiful women , a sexist and suave spy can who can do little wrong ( Sean Connery as Bond ) , a few gadgets and a lot of action scenes . The gadgets , which are always fun , were fewer in number than usual , I am sorry to say . The action scenes , although interesting , had absolutely no credibility . Of course , that isn't anything new but they are particularly ludicrous here . Our hero eliminates almost everyone while no one hits him ! Also , there are a number of scenes in which Bond escapes from impossible situations and they never show how he did them . All of a sudden , he's pictured somewhere else . In addition , with so many foreign accents , it was difficult to understand the dialog , at least on tape when I last viewed this . Perhaps the DVD has English subtitles , which would help immensely . Otherwise , the filmmakers keep this lively story moving fast most of the time and if you are a male who likes ogle pretty women , you have a lot to choose from here beginning with Claudine Auger . Aftter a good start , the second hour of this film was disappointing . Overall , I'd have to say the same thing after watching the previous Bond class , " Goldfinger . "
525460	4445210	737853	7.0	The Beginning Of ' The Numbers Game '	The time is Oct . 19 , 1932 : the depth of the Depression in the U . S . , which was a perfect time for gangsters to offer " the numbers . " For desperate people , looking for any kind of unforeseen hope , a little financial break even for a day or two , this lure to put money down on a number from 0 to 999 was tough to resist . The mob made an absolute fortune on this . Their take was 40 percent , so the profit had to be big . Elliot Ness ' objective , of course , is to break this number's game . He's hoping a friend of fellow agent " Martn Flaherty " ( Jerry Paris ) will help him do so , but Marty is not happy about leaning on an old friend . Nonetheless , when an old man kills a racketeer in a rage over a wrong number , Ness knows more than ever that something has to be done about this new crime gimmick That , and the fact that many people spent their family's bread money to gamble it away on " numbers . " Jay C . Flippen and Darryl Hickman play " Al " and " Phil " Morrisey , respectively . They are father-and-son numbers runners and they are the key to the storyIt's a decent episode but like a lot of these that I am re-visiting 40 years later , a lot slower than I remembered . It's just that times have changed and movie and TV shows are faster - paced than they were in the 1950s and ' 60s
524260	4445210	405159	7.0	Well-Crafted But Ludicrous , Insulting Story	GOOD NEWS - Interesting , right from the start . . . . nicely filmed . . . . . . an involving story with a female lead character you really care about with a fine performance by Hilary Swank , and the always-entertaining Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman as the male leads . The story , whatever one's view of the topic here , is well-crafted and certainly one you remember . BAD NEWS - Talk about an agenda ! Who produced this film ? Dr . Kevorkian ? Hollywood's Liberal agenda for this year must have been euthanasia because this picture , as good as it is , is not Acadamy Award Best Picture material . The championship fight scene , too , is ludicrous , in that the " bad girl , " if this was real life , would have been disqualified - period : no if , ands or buts . And - having a priest say the " f-word ? " Give me a break ! There's an example of yet another liberal " agenda . " - make a cleric look bad whenever possible . OVERALL - A severely flawed film but definitely interesting and worth seeing if for nothing else than provoking a good discussion on and pros-and-cons of the main subject matter ( which ain't boxing , folks ) .
523142	4445210	26135	7.0	Untalented & Unwanted . . . . . Until The End	A rooster , dog , cat and donkey all get the heave-ho from their farmer owner . Actually , the old man isn't all that mean ; the animals sleep on the job and deserved to get booted . They all cry the blues when the farm owner boots them in the butt but then things perk up when they notice a choir nearby singing . People throw coins from above and the singers go away happy . The animals figure , hey , let's try that gig , too . The trouble is , they're brutal at that , too . Instead of coins , people throw pots , pans and the kitchen sink at them . However , they may have little talent and aren't good workers , but they prove to be loyal to the farmer as we see in the dramatic final third of the story , which helps elevate this old cartoon from poor to fair . This cartoon was viewed on a DVD called " Cartoons That Time Forget : The UB Iwerks Collection Vol . 1 . "
526362	4445210	87800	7.0	A Frightening Start	Well , this was the beginning of " Freddy Kreuger , " who certainly became famous in the horror movie genre . Of those horror films that spawned numerous sequels ( this one , Halloween , etc . ) this was the best of the " opening " shows . It definitely is frightening . It has the usual crude teenagers , some gratuitous sex and wild Krueger scenes and is probably best-noted for showing Johnny Depp's film debut . Boy , does he look young ! He looks about 16 years old , as does Heather Langenkamp , who went on to play in several more of these Nightmare stories . This was the only movie in which she was foul-mouthed . Nice to see Rony Blackley , too . Wes Craven certainly started this series off with a bang .
523794	4445210	104522	7.0	Here's An Odd Irish Tale	I always remember this movie for the shock of seeing a horse trying to live an apartment . Now , there's an unusual sight ! I revisited this film last week and for a second and an overdo " ride " with these mystical Irish gypsies and their strange . By the way , I hadn't realized how nicely filmed this was until I saw it on 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen DVD . Also to my surprise was that it wasn't the happy , family film I had remembered . There are many moments of frustration , sadness , violence , injustice , ete . It's hardly a bunch of fun times . The language is such , too , that I wouldn't recommend this for little kids , unless perhaps in Ireland where everyone seems to use Jesus ' name in vain frequently , even kids . It's still a story , basically , about two kids trying to capture and then keep a white horse , which is taken away from them . The cops ( some crooked , as filmmakers love to show ) , the crooks and family are all out over the countryside looking for the boys and the horse . In between , their father slowly comes to grips with the death of his wife some seven years earlier , a tragedy he has never been able to deal with correctly . The best character and the most fun to watch is little " Ossie , " played by Ciaran Fitzgerald . He's the one most-attached to the horse and the wee one has some of the best lines in the film .
523398	4445210	26056	7.0	Gee Whiz !	I am NOT a fan of Katharine Hepburn . . . . but I really like her in this film . I don't think she ever looked cuter and was more appealing . One often forgets the fresh face and beauty she had when she was young . This film starts off wonderfully for 20 minutes , then bogs down a bit for an hour and then rallies brilliantly in the last 20 minutes . That last part is so good that made the film not only worthwhile to view but one to keep and watch every few years . It bogs down when Hepburn starts her deceiving scheme and nervously yaks and yaks and yaks trying to impress her boyfriend ( Fred MacMurray ) . The deceit involves her trying to hide her social status , something that must have meant a lot more back in the early ' 30s than it does today . Critics comment about how the dinner scene is a " classic " and the highlight of the film , but I didn't think it was all that great , although Hattie McDaniel is funny . It's what happened afterward that made it a memorable film to me . Although Hepburn and Fred MacMurray are the stars of this romance-comedy , Fred Stone almost steals the show . Playing Hepburn's dad in the film , he was both hilarious at times and very sad . . . . and always interesting . He gives an unbelievably powerful speech to his boss near the end of this film . Another plus for " Alice Adams " is the direction . This is early George Stevens , but just about any film that man directed is top-notch , including this one . Without giving away what happens in the story , the film does present a nice message of forgiveness and reconciliation and sports one of the stronger feel-good endings I've ever seen on film . Hepburn's last words in the movie are " Gee Whiz ! ! " That bygone innocent reaction to MacMurray's comment that he loved her says a lot about how movies and times have changed .
524104	4445210	265086	7.0	Good War Flick , But A Little Too Much To Take	If you like war action films , this one is for you ! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia . Frankly , it was too much action for me , but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes . This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes . After awhile you want to just say , " Enough already ! Let's take a break ! I don't know how much of this story is true . When they say , " based on a true story " that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes . However , reports are that it is pretty accurate . Regardless , the film has some good things going for it . First of all there is the military credo : : " Never leave anyone behind . " That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter ( named Black Hawk ) goes " down . " With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities , you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes . That also means you get some gruesome scenes , too . This film is very bloody . It's intense and visually unique , I think , for a war film . Speaking of that , with director Ridley Scott , you get stylish visuals : lots of them . In this film , you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors , great lighting and great facial closeups . The sound also is excellent with bullets " flying out " of all the surround speakers . In the end , a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military .
522935	4445210	802009	7.0	England : A Country With A LONG History !	" Little area , big influence , " is the way our host , Justine Shapiro , describes England in the opening of this 52-minute historic tour , which is just half of the DVD . The other half is similar-length tour of just London . Justine's trip begins at Hastings , where the famous battle of old days is reenacted each year , and we see some of that . We also go inside a neat lighthouse , very old penny arcade , and a spectacular Fantasy Pavilion . In going up to London , she advises to try to out-of-way places where you won't get mobbed with tourists . We visit a " pie and mash " eatery in the East End , made famous by Jack The Ripper , for one . The boat rides are a great way to see the countryside around the area . Traveling further north , she takes us on a special double-decker bus complete with showers , beds and whatever . . . . enough for eight people . That's where we go through Yorkshire and the famous Moors , where Emily Bronte was inspired to write , " Wuthering Heights . " Next stop is Whitby , an eerie place where Bram Stoker wrote " Dracula . " Then it's on to a place that might be unfamiliar to a lot of us North Americans : Hadrian's wall built by the Romans in 2 A . D . as a kind of border between the " civilized world " ( England ) and the " barbaric " ( Scotland ) . I'll bet the Scots don't think much of that . The wall stretches for 73 miles . We are then on a steam train . The Brits love them and their looks , and I agree with them . They are beautiful trains . Shapiro takes it to Liverpool where she then takes the " Magical Mystery Tour " to celebrate The Beatles . The final leg is in the West Country and the magnificent Longleat . This is another place where one really feels the history of this country , our host remarks , summing it up with " The past feels present here . " I checked out the next segment - the one covering the city of London - for 40 minutes until the host , a young Australian , Jonathan Atherton , got too offensive and obnoxious , getting drunk " in our church sanctuary and getting crucified , ha , ha , ha ! ! " as he hoists another beer . Imagine insulting another religion like that and putting it on TV and in a DVD , but insulting Christianity and the Cross . . . . well , that's okay . I won't watch anything more hosted by this ignorant moron nor will even report on what he said in here prior to his drunk scene , expect to say about 10 minutes before that , he did meet some fellow Aussies and they all got drunk , too . Nice lot , those mates , eh ? Let's hope they don't represent the average citizen in their country .
524982	4445210	910795	8.0	So Quiet It's Spooky	The one thing the viewer - at least me - gets most out of after watching this episode is the solitude of this rocky area , the overwhelming quiet of this part of the United States . . . . . so much so that it could literally drive one crazy , if you didn't have human company . " It's TOO quiet , " says our host and " survivor " Les Stroud . Our host winds up talking to a bird , after a few days of dead silence . The other thing that bugs Stroud the most , it appears , is the drastic changes in temperature from hot when the sun's out to bitter cold during the night . That , and , of course , a lack of water in the area . " Dehydration , " noted Stroud , " and the threat of it killing you is much worse than starvation . " In the end , he gets the heck out of there , even if it is a day earlier than planned . Lack of water and food will do that to you . Along the way , however , Stroud shows his survivor talents with some interesting tips on how to keep fires going . Who knew that those tasty little corn chips would be good kinder ? Or that cow patties are such a big help to keeping a campfire going for hours . . . . or that eating a little squirrel would be enjoyable ?
525224	4445210	167285	8.0	Early CG Effects Still Fun To Watch	This is an " odysessy through time " via computer animation , supposedly th work of over 300 artists . Made in the late ' 80s and released in 1990 , this was cutting edge stuff for the day . I thought it was good and quite interesting in spots . Most of the short scenes made no sense , just forms evolving into other forms , but that was fun to watch . This is all about visuals , not really about any kind of a story . There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men - creatures would dance around with birds overheard . All of it is computer animated which was new back then . Even the term " computer animated " was not well-known . It's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes . No words , just pictures with electronic music . Stoners must have really loved this . It's a nice , intriguing 40 minutes of " eye candy " and " head candy . " By today's CG effects this may have lost impact , but I think you'd still be entertained by this .
524677	4445210	17871	8.0	Only In Cartoons Can These Crazy Things Happen !	Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines : " A ham , A ham ! My kingdom for a ham sandwich ! ! ! " The dramatic guy that tells Felix he'll " have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies . " He's in tears . Felix just looks at him like he's nuts , and shrugs his shoulders . The old guy tells Felix to " go ye forth " and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood . Felix thinks , " How does he expect me to get the money ? " In minutes , of course ( this is a cartoon ) , he spots a shoe business owner putting up a " bankrupt " sale on his store . Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works . Well , it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home . In an outrageous scene , Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to Hollywood , transforming himself back to cat when they get there . We then witness Felix's attempts at getting into show business . His audition scenes are very funny , especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin . In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives . In all , quite a bit of material is in this 9 . 5 - minute cartoon . It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2 . 5 minutes , assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length . At any rate , there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon , like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes ! Crazy stuff .
522385	4445210	105466	8.0	Yes , The Devil Made Me Watch This !	This was a clever and funny movie , much better than I anticipated . Most of the humor involves takeoff or parodies of television programs and movies . Being familiar with most of them , I enjoyed the humor . The takeoff involved having the devil take charge of some of these programs . John Ritter and Pam Dawber play husband-and-wife " Roy and Helen Knable " who get sucked into buying a TV dish package straight from The Devil . After the purchase , which comes complete with 666 channels , mayhem ensues . There were a number of spots in here I just laughed out loud . Knowing a lot of the TV programs that were being spoofed helps a lot , of course , but there is a lot of good material in this film . The special-effects were pretty good , too , especially for a film that really never got a lot of exposure nor , I assume , had a huge budget . Jeffrey Jones and Eugene Levy , two guys who are usually pretty funny , supply some good humor here , too . I looked at this strictly for laughs even though I know the devil is somebody to take seriously , but this film was anything but played for seriousness . As a bonus , we even got a Chuck Jones cartoon in the middle of the story . This is one wacky movie and I'd like to see it on widescreen DVD . I last saw it on tape . This is recommended to those who enjoy dark humor .
527094	4445210	26393	8.0	Cagney ' s ' Untouchables '	Here's an old-time ( about 75 years old ! ) gangster movie that is fast-moving as all James Cagney crime films tend to be . In here , Cagney is the good guy , a " government man " out to get crooks , one of whom turns out to be his old pal . All the characters in here are pretty interesting , particularly Cagney's boss played by Robert Armstrong . Watching this film , one discovers an interesting fact : government agents weren't allowed to use guns in the early days . That didn't change until things got totally out of control with too many defenseless lawmen getting killed . Margaret Lindsay also stars in this movie , and that's a good thing . The more I see of her , the more I like her . It would have been interesting to see what roles she'd play if she was a young actress in today's films . Finally , the action scenes in this film reminded me of the old television series , " The Untouchables " with the machine guns blazing out of those big , boxy 1930 automobiles .
524692	4445210	443274	8.0	A Real Strtech , But Good Diversionary Entertainment	Well , I doubt anyone will fall asleep watching this film . That's the best feature of this movie : it's very entertaining and once you start it , it's tough to put down . Being only 90 minutes , it's a quick hour-and-a-half . It also helps to know that you are going to get the story told from a handful of angles , so expect to see similar scenes running over and over , each with a few new wrinkles added . Also , expect a lot of the action scenes that are both fun to view but not very credible . My favorite - spoiler alert ! - of that is when " Thomas Barne's " ( Dennis Quaid ) little blue car is totally bashed in by a huge 18-wheeler . Not only that , the car is smashed up against a brick wall . It should look like a metal pancake . Seconds later , Quaid emerges from the wreck and is running down the street like a football halfback shooting his pistol ! He hardly has a scratch on him , and the limp disappears after about three strides ! Credibility-aside , along with a few cheap shots with placards early on by a crowd which protesting the U . S . at an anti-terrorist summit ( they prefer terrorists , I guess ! ) and the usual politically-correct characters , it's a fun ride not to be taken seriously but as a short entertainment diversion . The twists are fun to see , too , as the same-but-similar story slowly unwinds and all the pieces finally fall into place by the end . . . . . even though , how they do manage that is by stretching things a bit !
522386	4445210	60838	8.0	Mice Were Funny , But Got A Bit Pushy	Rather than go into the story , which a couple of other reviewers did here , I'll state a few things that struck me funny in this Pink Panther cartoon . I liked the mouse's Park Avenue-type entrance , the fanciest I've ever seen in a cartoon , and cartoons love to show mice and cats . I also laughed at the " dagwood " sandwich he made and carried back to the hole , and the clever way he figured out how to stuff in through the small entrance . I also laughed at his buddies knocking on the front door and then racing in with musical instruments and a bottle of champagne for the party ! Later , we see them party hats on . These were amazing mice . One guy even plays the electric guitar . However , they lose their cuteness in the last minute or two . These guys are pushy !
523564	4445210	104558	8.0	7 Things You Usually Find In A Jackie Chan Film	With most of these Jackie Chan films , you are guaranteed of getting the same material , meaning : ( 1 ) tons of violence ; ( 2 ) extraordinary stunt scenes ; ( 3 ) good sound ; ( 4 ) some hokey dubbed voices ; ( 5 ) a juvenile story with even more - juvenile attempt at humor ; ( 6 ) very little profanity and blood ; ( 7 ) a stupid but still enjoying movie ( for at least one viewing . ) All of this adds up to a " fair " rating . The fun part of watching Chan's films are the outrageous action scenes and stunts by The Man , himself . Especially for someone getting up their in age , Chan is incredible since he does his own stunts . In this film , Chan's girlfriend , played by Michelle Yeoh , does her own stunts , too . She is an excellent martial arts talent in her own right and a pretty lady . By the way , during the closing credits they show some of the stunts that went wrong . Not all of these are shown for laughs . In a few of them , Chan is injured . The sound was amazing for a VHS . I can only imagine the stereo on the DVD . Overall , a dumb movie with unrealistic fight scenes ( people just about get killed , but keep getting up for more ! ) but if you know that and just want to enjoy a lightweight action film , it serves its purpose .
527360	4445210	104850	8.0	Being Invisible Isn't What It's Cracked Up To Be	There are some interesting lessons to learn from this film . . . . not that any of us will ever get to learn this since we'd have to be able to turn invisible . However , when we think about all the fun we could have being invisible , we don't think of all the problems it would cause us . This movie brings some of those to light , so to speak . I enjoyed Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah in here and I am not fans of either of them . Chase is funny in this film and does an outstanding job playing the role not just with humor but drama , romance and suspense . You get all of that in this movie . Hannah provides the beautiful face and someone for Chevy to chase . This is another PG-13 movie that really should have been rated R with the language , for one thing . Overall , it's a film whose title may sound hokey but the story is done well . It''s actually though-provoking . Being invisible would not be all fun and games .
526209	4445210	43090	8.0	A Very Good , Unknown Film Noir	This was a bit of a sleeper , better than I thought and not a well-known film to begin with , since it never came out on VHS . William Holden and Nancy Olson both worked on Sunset Boulevard this same year this was released and here are together again . Actually , I like the two a lot better in this film than the much better - known ' Boulevard . ' Yes , some of the scenes are a bit dumb but the story moves well and keeps your interest which is what a good crime story-drama should do . For some reason , I really enjoyed the train station , too . It looked awesome . Hopefully , some day this movie will be part of a film-noir package on DVD .
525848	4445210	43088	8.0	Powerful Film Unfairly Treated	The more I watch classic films , the more I discover what a great year 1950 was in the movie business . Here's another good film , and one many people are probably unfamiliar with . This one revolves around the newspaper business . Dan Duryea , as usual , is interesting as " Mike Reese , " a bad guy-turned-good guy journalist . He is joined in the cast by Herbert Marshall , Gale Storm ( one of the great names in show business and who will forever be " My Little Margie " to those of us who were around in the ' 50s ) , Howard Da Silva and Michael O'Shea . Of the above-mentioned , Da Silva was the most fascinating , as the brutal mob boss " Carl Durham . " He only had a minor role , but some of his lines were outstanding and his role was memorable . Da Silva was a great actor for film noirs . This isn't really a noir , but it's close . Marshall was just fine as the newspaper owner . The film was not kind to the newspaper business , so some media-minded film critics ( who probably had columns in daily papers ) didn't like this film for that reason . Too bad . They should have liked it , since it had Left Wing written all over it , with several Liberal themes and favorite catch-phrases such as " witch hunts " ( one of their all-time favorites ) . Nonetheless , it's a powerful film and well-acted .
527334	4445210	25922	8.0	The Quirks Of ' 30s Popeye Cartoons	For some strange reason , I've noticed that in a lot of these 1930s cartoons - Popeye's and others - flames from fire come alive . The flames take on a human personality and do human things . In here , one of the flames from a burning house sidles even over to the fire alarm box to send for the firefighters ! In other scene , flames from one window reach out and shake hands with a flame coming out of another window . Of course , it's Olive house on fire and , of course , Popeye and Bluto are the competing fireman are both ready to be the heroes . Those two have already been shown belting each other back at the company : Bluto , of Fire Co . " C " and Popeye , head of " D " company . I really enjoy the artwork on these ' 30s Popeye cartoons , how our main characters are drawn with the exaggerated features , and I also love how they draw buildings . Olive's huge house in the cartoon looks super . I also advise those who have this as part of the Popeye The Sailor Volume One 1933-1938 DVD to put on the English subtitles , otherwise you'll miss a lot of what Popeye says , since he mumbles a lot . In here , it's doubly important because Bluto mumbles like Popeye as they taunt each en route to trying to put out the big fire at Olive's house . Some of the dialog is funny . Most of it , however , is nothing of the laugh-out-loud variety and nothing noteworthy , except what idiots these two guys are - more concerned about beating up the other guy than saving the house ! It's little things in this cartoon that produce smiles , such as how they guys get water out of their hoses , how the ladder becomes alive , etc .
523845	4445210	35414	8.0	Spoofing Abbott & Costello , And Introducing ' Tweety '	A takeoff on Bud Abbott and Lou Costello , famous comedians of the classic era , we have two cats : " Babbit " and " Catstello " just trying to survive and find food , like climbing a very tall tree for a bird snack , if they can get it . That little bird turns out to be " Tweety , " the little yellow ( later on ) canary making his Looney Tunes debut . Actually , more than half of this cartoon features Tedd Pierce and Mel Blanc imitating the two comedians . They are far more scenes than the little bird but the best scenes are the ones with the little bird high up in his nest . Tweety is naked - no feathers . It's kind of weird , being skin color all over . It's like he's just a tiny baby that has been recently hatched . Anyway , he won't put up with a cat trying to get him - this is one strong little " boid . " " Catstello " can get a little too loud and abrasive ( Blan was never subtle with his voices ! ) but otherwise this was a fun cartoon and interesting Tweety's start in animated films . I thought the best thing about the cartoon was the direction by Bob Clampett . There are some great " camera " angles in here and it's drawn cleverly in many spots .
524150	4445210	1206156	8.0	A Totally-Insane ( But Fun ) Episode	There are so many wacky , insane things in this episode , I wouldn't know where to start . Suffice to say , this show continues people with green blood , a deer killed with a crossbow and then having a skirt put on it ; a lady who wears tinfoil and says she communicates with aliens , a 60-some year old married couple who die in their sleep in the same night but aren't murdered ; a ultra-violent drunk who is beats up several officers at police headquarters , is pepper-sprayed and then tasered and then bursts into flames and dies . In addition , there are lawnfuls of dead squirrels at the old folks place and at their welder / sculptor neighbor's , who is a woman who is flaky . . . . . . and then there is the big story about brutal migraines and what they are doing to some of the above-mentioned people . Among the wacky , sad to say , are the three usual CSI suspects : the ludicrous " Hodges , " Wendy , " and " David . " The latter , the assistant ME , is brought to tears over a dead animal but is never upset at a human being killed . Another CSI worker , the female who wears glasses ( " Mandy ? " ) , tells Hodges he'd better stop living with his mom if he wants a girl , meaning her . There is a lot more , but why spoil it ? At the end of the show , Grissom gives his " Theory of Everything " which could possibly tie all the bizarre events together . His New Age speech all being tied together by some invisible string is utterly laughable , but he's serious and all his CSI subordinates seem to nod in agreement . Man , these " scientists " will anything about the universe , except about a God , of course . None of the three CSI shows gets as bizarre as this one has done the last three years . Sometimes it's funny , sometimes it's insultingly-stupid but it's usually pretty interesting . Never a dull moment in Las Vegas , I guess , especially when you have wackos as the good guys and the bad guys !
525024	4445210	36334	8.0	Daffy Is One ' Scrappy ' & Patriotic American !	As others have explained here , this cartoon was made as part of the film industry's bid to help the U . S . and Allies with the World War II effort . The message in this one , with Daffy Duck providing the message with laughs , was to encourage people to save scrap so that it could be converted to weapons and ammo . Signs like " Get that lead out ! ( along with iron , brass , tin , etc . ) are at Daffy's Scrap Heap , where he does his bit to help win the war . Any question that this cartoon is anything but that is erased in his first scene when we see him with an air-raid helmet on and he's singing , " We're in to win , turn in your tin . . . . . . To our nation's call every rubber ball , Goes to conquer freedom's foe . " You get the idea : this is more of a patriotic message instead of the normal wacky Looney Tunes effort . However , that's not to say you won't laugh with Daffy in here , or enjoy the inventive artwork and direction by Frank Tashin . Much of the story tells of Hitler hearing about Daffy's scrap pile and he sends a billy goat ( don't ask ) to destroy it . The German leader is shown , it's safe to say , in a very unflattering light ! No objections there , from anyone I've hear , and none from me . It's ironic that our foes in WWII were depicted so negatively but Hollywood doesn't say one word today about the Islamic terrorists trying to destroy the U . S . Today , as I write this , there are several anti - American military films that are being shown and nothing which makes the enemies look bad . Over 3 , 000 citizens are murdered in the World Trade Center buildings and today's Hollywood only makes films mocking our soldiers ? Unbelievable ! Think about it . Watching this cartoon really makes the contrast really stand out , especially at the end when Daffy Duck is transformed into " SuperAmerican . " .
525888	4445210	443706	8.0	The All-Consuming Zodiac Killer	A couple of years ago , I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case . Since the murderer was never apprehended , this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years . There are websites and all kinds of people , apparently , who can't let go of this famous case . Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession . I , probably like a number of viewers , thought this was just another film about the murderer , and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie . However , it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer . That man is " Robert Graysmith , " a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle . He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal . The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer , so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him . For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed , brutal serial-killer story , this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of " Graysmith " plus an in - depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which , as any cop could tell you , can be tedious work . However , there is still is enough violence and suspense , particularly early on , to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself , and a lot of suspects to entertain the " whodunit " mystery-solving viewer . I admit the story began to drag a bit after two hours but overall , I thought it was an intelligent , interesting profile of all concerned : most-likely killer , detectives , newsmen , witnesses , other suspects , Graysmith's wife - everyone who could possibly been involved with this long-standing unanswered crime case . In a way , this story reminded me of the CSI shows on TV where every five minutes we get a new can't-miss suspect who turns out to be a false lead . However , in this story , no one was ever tried and convicted . But , the movie does come to a conclusion on who the guilty party was , and makes a convincing case for it . Thus , at least according to the film , Mr . Graysmith's work was not in vain . ( The real-life suspect died of a heart attack , so we may never know for sure . ) The downside for Mr . Graysmith , and people we may not even know about , was that his life and others have been radically altered for the worse this obsession to find the Zodiac killer . It cost Mr . Graysmith his marriage . Overall , this is a bit long but it features excellent acting by everyone and offers diverse characters . I would like to have seen more with Arthur Allen . John Carroll Lynch is not a big - name actor but he's good and , for obvious reasons , a fascinating person in this story . Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in " Se7en " and " Panic Room , " but this is still worth a look and recommended .
524197	4445210	79240	8.0	Nice Period Piece For A Heist Flick	Wow , this is a wonderfully-filmed movie that especially looked good since it was one of the first DVDs I purchased a decade ago . Rich colors and good period detail of 19th century England made it visually attractive . However , the picture was too grainy . I hope someone has re-issued this and given it the transfer it deserves . Beware that it takes quite awhile before the actual holdup takes place . This is almost a two-hour film and they build up slowly to famous heist . However , I didn't find any of it boring . This is rated PG but there are quite of bit of sexual innuendos early on by Connery as he woos Lesley-Ane Down . Other than that , it's a pretty tame film . Donald Sutherland adds a touch a touch of humor here and there as he and Connery pull off the suspenseful heist . . . . and it is suspenseful . Connery trying to maneuver on top of the train was a highlight , as was the " whooshing " sound of the train each time it passed under a bridge . The stereo in here is very good for a film almost 30 years old .
523686	4445210	36119	8.0	Some People ( or mice ) Enjoy The Chase	There was a lesson to this story , one of those " you don't miss what you have until you lose it " or " the grass is always greener on the other side , " etc . However you phrase it , Jerry discovers he'd rather have Tom chasing him around the house than no Tom at all . He misses the excitement . He doesn't think so in the beginning , " framing " our cat and having " Mammy Two Shoes " boot him out of the house for breaking a vase which Jerry broke . While the devilish mouse is singing " Happy Days Are Here Again , " in a few days he winds up bored out of his mind and wishing Tom was back in the house . Finally , he goes out to Tom across the street and they concoct a plan to get him back into the good graces of " Mammy , " so he can get his warm home back . This isn't hilarious but there are enough gags in here plus a rarity : hearing the two main characters speak English briefly - to definitely warrant watching this . Some of the facial expressions of Jerry made me really laugh . It was " cute " and funny at the same time . This was part of the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Volume Two DVD .
522950	4445210	51698	8.0	' Happy Easter ' From Little Quackers	The Easter Bunny delivers a gift to Tom and Jerry one Easter morning - a brightly-colored egg . The two adversaries fight over it , until it hatches on Tom's head . It turns to be " Little Quackers , " a tiny yellow duck who has been in a handful of other Tom and Jerry cartoons . Here , the little guy has two sentences he repeats over and over : " Happy Easter " and " Oh , boy ! " He says the latter each time he sees a " swimming pool " such as Tom's milk dish , or the household aquarium . the water cooler , the bat tub , etc . Neither Tom nor Jerry are thrilled with this little duck , and they follow him around , get wet a number of times and try to get rid of the duck . They come up with a good plan , but the duck has the last laugh at the end , which is cute . It's refreshing to see Tom and Jerry on the same page , for a change . Overall , not a lot of yuks but a very charming cartoon and definitely recommended .
523955	4445210	106489	8.0	Interesting Portrait With A Killer ' Hero '	Here is a realistic-looking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s . Excellent acting and a good job of re-creating the era and site's atmosphere are main things going for this film . Also the soundtrack is very , very good . The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a cold-blooded killer is made to be the hero - a guy that you root for ! Unbelievable . Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri , who outperforms the more famous and great actor and co-star Robert De Niro . Actually , the co-star is Lilo Brancoto , who was recently in the news for allegedly committing a major crime himself . Anyway , supposedly this is Palminteri's story of his childhood and features him as a young boy and then as a 17-year-old . He has a straight father ( De Niro ) but looks up to the area's Mafia leader " Sonny " ( Palminteri ) , who takes the kid under his wing for not ratting on him when he witnessed him killing someone . It may have a bad message , and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way , but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours . It was good to see De Niro play the honest , hard-working bus driver who wants his kid to have character and not emulate the local hoods . This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently . This is more of man's movie , really , with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women ! " Sonny , " despite being a killer , is shown to be a caring , compassionate guy who cares about young " Calogero " ( Brancoto , and earlier as a 9-year-old played by Francis Capra ) . There are so many mixed messages in here - good and bad - it would make your head swim , but it is a crime film very much worth investigating .
525107	4445210	218839	8.0	A Bit Sleazy , But Very Funny	Considered by many who have watched all three of Christopher Guest's " mockumentary " films as his funniest , " Best In Show " is guaranteed to evoke a number of laughs and offend someone . This is a typical modern-day comedy meaning that sex jokes dominate and there is both a gay and lesbian " couple . " So , if you've heard this is about dog shows , don't rush out and rent this and watch it with the kiddies . It is anything but family fare . Yet , despite all the sleaze factor - and there is a lot of it - I still found this " charming , " for some reason . The laughs range from crude to subtle and the characters who enter their dogs in professional shows are really the subject of exaggerated ridicule here : from Yuppies to gay men to redneck hunters to dog trainers to nerdy types to whatever . No one pictured in this movie is a healthy , normal person . Everyone is " whacked " to some degree , except the announcer . However , his sidekick , the color man ( played by Fred Williard ) is brutal ! The message , obviously , is that some people just take their pets a little too seriously !
524081	4445210	51329	8.0	Very Comparable To " Paladin " But Not As Well-Known	This was another good western back in the ' 50s which gives me fond memories . I remember how me and my pals thought this hero was " cool , " something like Richard Boone was in " Have Gun , Will Travel . " The main differences in this western as opposed to most was that the title characterpacked a little derringer in his hat , and the setting was New Orleans instead of the old west . Otherwise , he was , like Boone's " Paladin " a smooth , dapper and cool customer . Jock Mahoney ( " Yancy Derringer " ) was the rugged , silent type , if I remember correctly . The shows were very interesting and we looked forward to them each week . Why this show only lasted on year is a real mystery to me . I don't remember anyone who didn't enjoy it . The mid-to-late ' 50s was a fabulous era for westerns on TV . If this ever came out on DVD , I would buy it immediately .
525676	4445210	120832	8.0	I Like This . . . . . Which Surprises Me	Most people didn't like this movie , from what I have heard and read over the years . Some of my friends who saw it didn't like it either . For some reason , I did , and that was despite a few things I normally don't put up with ( too much usages of the Lord's name in vain and the usual anti-military agenda . ) However , I found this a very fast-moving , involving story with Nicholas Cage playing an extremely interesting person : " Rick Santoro , " a guy who acts like a complete crazy man at the beginning but slowly gets it together as the film goes on . Gary Sinise plays his normal corrupt role ( this was before his CSI : New York days ) and Carla Gugino was very easy on my eyes . Brian DePalma directed this , so you know it's going to be stylishly shot , too . This looks very good on DVD . All the characters are interesting , actually . One complaint I agree with : the ending was a bit weak and detracts from the story . It's a rough film but edgy and interesting . Don't be discouraged reading a lot of negative reviews about this . It's good entertainment .
523236	4445210	114194	8.0	Walken Makes This Preposterous Story Fun	This was a different kind of horror movie with bad angels as the main attraction . Actually , the main attraction is Christopher Walken in the role of " Gabriel . " He's extremely entertaining with his mixture of humor and evil . He admonishes people for profanity ! Of course , the theology in this movie is so preposterous it's hilarious . In movies like this ( actually almost all movies ) you aren't going to get Biblically-based stories , just a lot of mumbo-jumbo passed on as such . At least in the end , the hero of the film correctly identifies the warring angel as one doing so strictly out of jealously for God . That's Bibically accurate , but the rest of the theology here is totally bogus . You just hope people aren't gullible to believe this stuff . However , a lot of people probably don't know there are such things as bad angels , so that part is true . Theology-aside , this is a very entertaining movie . The language is tame but beware there are a couple of very gory scenes that might offend . The special - effects are good . Walken is a " trip " to watch and Virginia Madsen looks beautiful .
526974	4445210	44313	8.0	' Great Horny Toadies ! '	This is one of those Bugs Bunny versus Yosemite Sam cartoons except Sam , in this story , is called " Chilacott Sam . " However , it's the same loud-and-obnoxious two-gun sawed-off , red-haired and greedy " varmint . " In this cartoon , he's a " claim jumper , " a guy trying to steal other's gold discoveries up in Alaska . By the way , there is some beautiful artwork in here with all the mountain scenery . When he finds out Bugs has a green thumb-type magic touch for finding gold , Sam follows him and offers to be his partner . " All you have to do , " says Sam , " is find all the gold and I'll share it with you 50-50 . " " Honest and for true ? " responds Bug sarcastically while giving us - the audience - a look . " Well , what are we waiting for ? There's gold in them thar hills . " One of Bugs Bunny's favorite things had to be making an idiot of those who think they are putting something over on him . He likes to play dumb and then totally ruin the person . He's very sadistic at times and very funny ! I loved some of Sam's exclamations in here , such as the one you see in the subject head here . It was just one of many Sam used in this cartoon .
524311	4445210	86197	8.0	Real Heroes , And An Era That Went By All Too Fast	An interesting insight into the United States ' space program , beginning with the exploits of fighter pilot Chuck Yeager ( Sam Shephard ) and concluding with the dramatic flights of the first astronauts . Those astronauts - the Mercury 7 pilots - are a varied group of aviators and they are all pretty interesting guys . John Glenn ( Ed Harris ) gets favorable treatment in here among the group . Gordon Cooper might be the wildest with the cocky and humorous Dennis Quaid playing him . Overall , it's a good cast including not just the fliers but their wives . I also enjoyed Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard and Barbara Hershey as Yeager's wife . Yeager's feats were perhaps the most interesting and they set a fast tone to this 3-hour film as we witness him breaking several sound-barrier records prior to the formation of the astronaut team . Then we are treated to a long-but-interesting segment of how those first astronauts were trained . The only unnecessary and ludicrous parts of this film were the ones on Lyndon Johnson , where they made him into a total fool . It was as if the screen writers had a personal vendetta against him , to make him look almost like a cartoon figure . And the bit with the Australian Aborigines smacks too much of Hollywood's love affair with tribal religions . I sincerely doubt some sparks from a fire on earth could be seen miles and miles above in space . At any rate , this was an informative look at a period in our history than came-and-went way too fast . Sad to say , most people know very little about those first astronauts , who were true heroes . At least this film gives them their due , as well as to Yeager , who deserved this tribute , too
527295	4445210	51756	8.0	' Well , The Least You Can Do Is Get Me Liquored Up '	With a title this corny , I was expecting a lot of laughs , a fun B-movie with Ed Wood-style film-making . Well , I got them , but that mostly in the beginning . The bulk of the film is quite serious and holds up pretty well , even today . The best lines , in the opening segments , come from " Marge " ( Gloria Talbott ) , the one I quoted for the subject head . She said that on her wedding night at the restaurant , since her new husband seemed to be ignoring her . You see , her hubby had already been taken over by an extra-terrestrial being the night before . He just wasn't himself after that . . . . . but who knew ? Unfortunately , nobody for quite awhile in this story , which made life rough for poor " Marge Ferrell . " The lines in this film weren't just corny . Some of them were downright funny . At the guy's bachelor party , which began the show , the men had some humorous lines about marriage and freedom , and later in the show there are a couple of funny scenes . Later one of Marge friends acts goofy and remarks , " I just love to rehearse for weddings , especially when they are my own ! " However , the story begins to get serious after the first 10-15 minutes and gets more and more so after Marge follows her husband one night and sees her odd-acting husband is not the man she thought she married . Laser beams and a spaceship will do that to you ! From that point , it becomes a very familiar story for fans of sci-fi : something we've seen in a lot of films the past 50 years - aliens transform into humans and one that hasn't gets burned by family and friends she trusts because she doesn't realize they , too , have also turned into aliens . In other words , this has a lot of " Invasion Of The Body Snatchers " type of paranoia story , just without the pods . " Invasion " was released two years earlier than this in 1956 . Hollywood , lacking imaginative writers the past few decades , continues to make films with the same storyline as you see here . , but this one can be excused because it was still fairly early in the genre . Thanks to the actors here , and a few different twists , the movie keeps your attention . The only frustration is to see a person telling the truth and not being believed . Talbott , to me , was a familiar face because she acted in many television shows in the 1960s while Tyron , who got some hype for starring in " The Cardinal , " a big-name film that bombed at the box office , wound up being a better writer than an actor . But when it comes to ' 50s sci-fi films , great acting isn't a requirement anyway , and most of us don't watch it for that . Overall , this is pretty good , nothing super but certainly worth a look now that there is a good DVD transfer of it available . Yes , it is far better than the stupid title but still : don't take it too seriously - just have fun with it . Note : the police captain was played by John Eldredge , a regular guest on " The Adventures Of Superman , " in which he almost always played a villain . Also ex-boxer Maxie Rosenbloom is his normal entertaining self in here , playing , as usual , a bartender .
524262	4445210	350258	8.0	The Memorable Good & Bad Of Ray	Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles . To the film's credit , it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles ' character and the choices he made , both personally and professionally . This is a slick-looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place . Not only does it look good , it sounds good . I only wish there was more music in here . When it's inserted , it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it . Assuming , at least for review purposes , that the story was true , I was impressed and disappointed with Charles , meaning the story left some memorable impressions since I'm writing this 16 months after viewing it . Main impressions include : GOOD - Re-living Ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically , such as going " country " for awhile . The man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it . Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - with no help ! That's just amazing . BAD - I also remember through this film how easily hooked Ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife . A really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's Little League games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her , even fathering a child with a member of his singing group . The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event , the accidental death of his brother . That tragedy was used as cop-out for all Ray's misdoings as an adult , which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions . Note : There is an extended version with the DVD but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching , so stick with the " theatrical version . "
527453	4445210	112857	9.0	A Different Shade Of Film Noir	This is the kind of film that can stay with you for awhile after you watch it : a haunting kind of film that isn't always pleasant or easy to understand but you remember it . It also helps to have a fondness for the 1940 film noir movies . It doesn't help that it appears racist in nature with people of one color all being the bad guys while people with another color all the good guys . I won't say which is which , but if the colors were reversed , there would have been an outcry about the obvious bias here by screenwriter-director Carl Franklin . Despite this , it's still a fascinating movie that just oozes with the 1940s atmosphere . Great narration in there , a la film noir , great automobiles and great sets . It puts you right into the late 40s in Los Angeles , a little bit like the film Chinatown . Denzel Washington does a nice job with the narration and the lead role , the character of " Easy Rawlins , " off the book by Walter Moseley ( which I read and recommend ) . Tom Sizemore and Don Cheadle play very intense characters in supporting roles , particularly Cheadle as the trigger-happy " Mouse . " Jennifer Beals is alluring as the mysterious " Daphne Monet . " The film is a bit confusing in parts and was especially so for me since the book was not exactly the same and had a totally different ending . Nonetheless , the film has always fascinated me and drawn me back for multiple viewings . It's good storytelling and it would be fun to see more of Moseley's books translated to the big screen .
526916	4445210	1126561	9.0	Story Starts Off With A Bang , But Ends On A Sad Note	This starts off as a very bizarre story but ends with a tragic tale that devastates one of the CSI regulars , " Danny Messer . " ( Carmine Giovinazzo ) . Some obnoxious guy at the bar lights up an expensive cigar . It blows up in his face . This isn't some novelty-store item ; this stogie was constructed for a big , destructive bang , and half the man's face is blown off . Who did it , and why ? The investigation leads to " Laughing Larry " and other assorted strange characters . This story , despite the gruesomeness of seeing the lower half of a man's face blown off , is very interesting and has some comical moments , too . The second story is anything but comical . It begins with a small neighborhood boy , someone who lives a few doors down from Danny , knocks on his door and reminds him they have to go to church for the annual " blessing of the bikes . " The kid has a new bike and wants the local parish priest to bless it . That happens , and while Danny and the kid are heading home , Danny is diverted by a shot and yells for help . He tells the boy to race home and he'll catch up with him later . Another shot is fired and the boy is killed in front of a store . It turns out to be total accident ; the boy in the wrong place and the wrong time . After the investigation , Danny has to go home and tell the mother her boy has been killed . It ends on that dramatic note .
525088	4445210	60810	9.0	A Great Little Story That's Fun For Kids & Senior Citizens	This was a nice little half-hour movie , which reminded me a bit of another film of similar length that was popular 50 years ago : The Red Balloon . " Paddle To The Sea , " made 42 years ago , never got the publicity or achieved the popularity of " The Red Balloon " but if you liked the latter , you'll like this . I enjoyed them equally . This is a Canadian movie which begins by showing a boy whittling this amazing piece of work : an Indian - very stoic looking - sitting in his canoe . On the side of the boat , he asks that anyone who handles this piece of art , " please throw it back in the water . " The boy decides to let this boat go as far as it can in the water . Although he lives on a mountain , he knows once the ice of winter melts , the boat will slide down the steep hill into a small creek and then into a river , into a bigger river and , hopefully , all the way to Atlantic Ocean . We ( the camera ) follow the progress of this little toy boat through several seasons , some human contact , some contact with sea creatures and birds . The little boat navigates down small rivers , rapids , whirlpools , big rivers , small lakes , big lakes , canals . . . . you name it . Unlike most of the reviewers here , I never saw this movie as a kid . I am only seeing it now as a 60-year-old man , but I enjoyed it as much as any kid . This is " good stuff " that should appeal to anyone .
523752	4445210	104511	9.0	Nothing Like Some Good ' Italian Food ! '	I've always found this a " guilty pleasure , " an extremely entertaining profane-gross-funny film about a female vampire who likes " Italian food , " meaning she likes to kill members of the Mafia ! ! I am a bit partial in favor of this movie , anyway , because I am fan of Anne Parillaud . She starred in two of my favorite films : Map Of The Human Heart and Frankie Starlight . To me , she's always great to look at listen to , especially with a comedy here . This is about as good as she's ever looked . I also enjoyed her narration . Also , with director John Landis , you almost always get a very entertaining movie . The special effects in here are fun to watch and the general off-the-wall humor is great . If you appreciate dark humor , you'll like this movie . The filmmakers also did not go overlong on the action scenes . The film is almost a put-on about vampire movies . The negatives are too much profanity , too much for a comedy . It sometimes gets ridiculous . Robert Loggia plays most of the profane characters I've ever heard on film , yet is very funny at times . The gore is overdone in parts , too , but nowadays - even watching television ( i . e . CSI ) - we're used to that now . My other complaint is why this DVD is not on widescreen . Why is it only offered in pan-and-scan ? If you don't mind blood , guts and foul language , this is a hilarious film .
525997	4445210	60835	9.0	I Wish They Would Have Kept Going !	Our pink hero is searching for used cars in a lot when he discovers a James Bond-type Aston Martin vehicle with all the gadgets . This little sports car intrigues and impresses him , so he buys it . As in other Pink Panther cartoons , an inanimate object turns to be human-like , so when our guy brings his new car back home and begins to spray paint the front of it pink , the car balks ! It wants no part of this spray-paint job ! The car - not the Panther - winds up in a drag race against an old lady , who turns out to be " Granny Flash : senior citizens drag champion . " This was hilarious , thanks to Granny , and I hated to see it end so abruptly . They could have continued this for another full cartoon with the just race between the two cars .
522272	4445210	166331	9.0	Very Humorous & Entertaining Episode	This was a hoot ! " Norman Shendley " ( Denholm Elliot , of " Raiders of the Lost Ark " fame ) , plays a man both haunted and delighted by his dreams . The dreams are so real that he , and we , aren't sure what's reality and what isn't . However , we can see the purpose of the " dream " as the story goes along : getting a man to murder his wife and run off with his hot secretary ! The dreams are a combination of sexual fantasies and nightmares . Regarding the fantasies , Lucy Gutteridge is the most fun to watch and gives a perfect demonstration on how wigs and clothes can make a woman look totally different . In each dream sequence , she's always " Lolly " but with a totally different look and character , although always the bimbo until the real and normal Lolly appears at the end . She does a great comedic job with this role . James Laurenson's facial expressions as " Raburn " are funny and Pat Heywood gives a realistic performance as Norman's wife " Emily . " She reminded me a bit of Anne Ramsey in " Throw Momma Off The Train , " but not as gruff . Actually , the more the story went on , the less of a villain she appeared . She and Norman , frankly , deserved each other ! I won't say more because I don't want to give away everything in this very inventive episode . I've only seen a few of these Hammer TV episodes , but this is my favorite so far . This was a great mix of horror , comedy , fantasy and suspense , with a heavy emphasis on the humor .
525533	4445210	36050	9.0	Painfully Funny	Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book , his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace . All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by . ( The flea is dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name " A . Flea " on it . ) He gets out his telescope and spots the dog . ( We see a big shot of the dog's butt and the flea whistles in excitement , screaming " T - Bone ! " He then sings , " There's food around the corner ; there's food around the corner ! " ) That sets up the storyline of this cute-but-obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog . The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea . The drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times . This might be the funniest canine I have ever seen in a cartoon ! The poor pooch , under a threat of having to take a bath , as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain . It's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes , jackhammers and the like on the dog . He puts firecrackers in the dog's behind . It's brutal !
525233	4445210	121766	9.0	They Really Did Save The Best ' Til Last	I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies . I enjoyed the films , except for Attack Of The Clones , but wasn't a huge fan . Having seen the first five , I eventually got around to checking out this last one , if for no other reason than curiosity . Wow , it changed my whole outlook . I cannot believe how impressed I was with this film , how well the writers wrapped up the whole saga and put all the pieces together . This was an excellent film , the best of the entire series . It inspired me to buy the latest DVD set which had the first three movies released and then reacquire the Clones film to complete my DVD collection of it . I'm writing this review months after seeing " Sith . " so it's just a few general thoughts . I remember thinking , after watching the wild opening , that this was going to be another one of the modern-day action films with too much action . . . . but it settled down and wasn't vastly overdone in that area , although it could have toned it down a bit . Better than the action or special effects was simply the way the writers tied everything up , how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader , and his son wound up being the hero " Luke " that we saw in those early episodes of the 1970s and 1980s . The special effects were , of course , top-notch . When you go back and see those early films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area . I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film , there is so much detail . It's mind-boggling . I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized : this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years amazing .
526190	4445210	86423	9.0	A Drama With Realism , Heart & Dignity	This is a movie with a lot of " dignity . " It has such realistic people , it kept me fascinated because it seemed so different from most films I've watched . There aren't a lot of dramatic things that happen in the story yet , as a whole , it's a wonderful tale that stays with you . It's a lot more than just seeing an Oscar-winning performance by Robert Duvall as Texan and former C & W singer and writer , " Mac Sledge . " It's simply good storytellingI can't say I am a fan of Duvall's country singing , but that is the only thing I didn't like . Well , maybe " Dixie " ( Betty Buckley ) , who played a bitter ex-wife of Duvall's in here . She was not pleasant , but others were really nice , likable people . Yet , this is not some sappy movie just because most of the people are good folks . As in film noirs in which the viewer has a sense of dread , knowing something bad is around the corner , I felt the same thing in this film , even though it didn't necessarily happen . I mean with the main characters : Mac , Rosa Lee and Sonny . There was underlying tension , probably because of Sledge's alcoholic and violent past , that made me fear that any minute he was going to ruin the nice setup he had with a good woman and nice stepson . Duvall , as usual , makes his role a fascinating and unpredictable one . With many of the people he has played over the years , you never am sure what his characters are going to do next . Tess Harper , as Mac's new wife , and Alan Hubbard , as her son , are two of the most realistic characters I've ever seen on film . It helped they were from the area so their accents were real . This is a just straight drama , with a solid screenplay by Horton Foote and direction by Bruce Beresford ( " Driving Miss Daisy " ) . In addition , actors Buckley ( who can sing , too ) , Wilford Brimley and Ellen Barkin all give memorable supporting performances . It was an interesting tale of something I have rarely seen on film in the past 50 years : a good Christian woman lifting up a man to her level . She never had to do it verbally , never nagged or preached to the man , just set example of how to act and be a loving , supportive spouse . There is a lesson for people here with how well " Rosa Lee " handled situations . Nice . . . . . very nice .
527339	4445210	25071	9.0	Sleepwalking Slapstick Has To Be Seen To Be Believed !	Sometimes a theme song , so to speak , accompanies these early Popeye cartoons , and that's the case here as we listen to " Have You Ever Seen A Dream Walking ? " Well , Popeye does here with Olive Oyl . So does Bluto . These two spot Olive outside walking on a flagpole and on the roof of their high-rise building and both vow " to save her . " In this episode , both guys have rooms on the second-to-the-top floors and Olive lives on the top floor . Both guys have Olive's picture above their bed and Olive has both guys ' photos above hers ! Yes , this is the first of instance of many years of fickleness by Olive . Prior to this , the first 14 cartoons had Olive strictly interested in Popeye only . As the years went on , she played the two guys against each other all the time . Tons of sight gags make this an excellent Popeye cartoon . Olive taking giant strides from rooftop to rooftop to a construction sight are very good ; the shots the two guys trying to save her are clever . . . . very clever with all three of them sleepwalking on the high beams at one point . You really have to see this as a description doesn't quite do it justice . The ending , though , isn't justice for poor Popeye . This was a hoot to watch and looked fantastic on that restored DVD package of cartoons featuring Popeye from 1933 to 1938 . They did great job from the master prints of these theatrical releases .
525244	4445210	44198	9.0	Artwork And Dream-Like Visuals Elevate Story	It's pouring out and traveler Porky is looking for some refuge in the storm . He wonders if the people in " that quaint old castle " on top of the nearby hill will put him up for the night . En route , he sees a sign that says , " Beware of the Leprechauns . " What nonsense , Porky thinks . Upon entering the castle , he meets " Seamus O'Toole , " caretaker of the " Clarey Castle . " " Seamus " is really two leprechauns standing on top of the other . They are " O'Pat " and " O'Mike " and they think Porky has come to steal their pot of gold . What happens after that , with the magical green shoes , is bizarre with dream-like sequences . There are some very cool visuals . The artwork in here is just beautiful , start-to-finish . Most of these cartoons in the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection " are restored to bold , bright colors and give the excellent artists who drew these animated short subjects their due .
525644	4445210	1002989	9.0	Great Songs , And A Nice Tribute To Jim Croce	Jim Croce , a singer from the early 1970s , had a bunch of hit songs ( eight ) in a short span ( two years ) and then died tragically in an accident . He was only 30 years old . In this television-for-BBC concert , released on DVD about five years ago , Jim performs many of his great songs . In addition to footage of this made-for-TV concert , we also see him performing in other televised appearances , mostly , I think , from the U . S . A . Wherever the setting , this disc gives you a very nice , intimate look at this talented man . It's hard to believe these were done over 30 years ago , and that he's been gone that long . What you get is mainly a pleasant , small atmosphere with the artist and another guitarist singing a bunch of Croce's songs and Jim casually discussing some things about his career . He has a pleasing way of telling stories and had a very popular way of singing very interesting and sometimes very humorous songs . Those songs sound just as good today as they did 35 years ago . For a sincere , loving tribute to a wonderful artist and just plain nice guy , this is highly recommended .
526419	4445210	44048	9.0	Trying To Keep It Clean	Is there anything more pleasing for Jerry to hear than Spike threatening Tom with sentences that start , " If you do this ( or that ) I will tear you limb from limb ! ? " At that point , Jerry knows he will see his nemesis get torn to shreds by the big bulldog . He'll make sure whatever " that " is , will happen . I always said Jerry had a sadistic streak in him . In this story , the threat is not to keep Spike's little boy " Chip " clean . Spike had already given his beloved little dog a bath and Tom inadvertently had gotten him dirty again . If it happens again Spike promises to pulverize the cat . Jerry , of course , overhears this and gets to work . He gets help from lady luck and some dumb moves by Tom . Tom's ventriloquist act was the highlight the cartoon : absolutely fabulous comedy bit , one of the best I've seen in this famous series .
525585	4445210	281686	10.0	A Real Shock - It's Good !	I laughed when a friend suggested this movie . " Yeah , right , " I answered , eyes rolled up . " Well , " he finally said a few weeks later , " Here , just look at it . Take my copy and bring it back . " " Okay , " I answered , " what do I have to lose ? " Obviously , I was shocked . This has to be one of the all-time surprises I've ever encountered in movie-watching . Who would have thought this film was this good ? Talk about " original ! " This is about as original and entertaining as they come , and , as I have stated in several other reviews , entertainment is the name of the game . . . . so I have to rank this film right up there with my favorites . I refuse to detail the story because the more you explain what it's about , the stupider is sounds and the less likely you will give it a shot . I will say Bruce Campbell does a fabulous job of imitating Elvis Presley . In fact , he is the best I have ever heard , speaking-voice-wise . Ossie Davis is also a hoot as the old black man who thinks he's President John F . Kennedy . See ? I can't say more , because it gets worse , story-wise , the more you explain . Just trust me that if you appreciate dark humor with some horror thrown in , you'll love it . It's a bit sleazy and the language is very rough , so be ready for that . I guess you could say this " is not for all tastes . " You have to be a little warped to enjoy this , but most of us are to some degree . Be also be ready for one of the oddest films you've ever seen .
523937	4445210	885614	10.0	So Far , The Most Interesting Episode Of The Season	Most of the CSI shows try to grab you with some sensational opening shot , and this one certainly does as a man's parachute fails and he crashes to his death in the middle of Manhattan . The thing is , he was a professional and someone caused this death to happen . It's especially puzzling when a bunch of dead racing pigeons are found on the ground with the victim ! Soon , we find a racing pigeon owner dead in his rooftop coop , with a wound that looks like someone put a buzz-saw to his neck . " Mac " and the crew finds out the guy was in the FBI's witness protection outfit . The secondary story involves a super-rich family that had a lavish birthday party for their 16 - year-old girl where daddy's big present was a new $60 , 000 car . Unfortunately , at the unveiling daddy was in the driver's seat and dead . When the CSI team comes to investigate , they open the car door and a cobra inside strikes and bites Lyndsay ! An ambulance comes for her but we discover quickly that she will be fine . Soon , we find out the girl's brother put the snake in the car as a prank . This episode , as you can tell reading all of this , is full of odd occurrences , one weird finding after another and very , very interesting . No sense going into all the facets of these crimes but this is a highly-recommended , maybe the best one of the season so far .
527436	4445210	52618	10.0	Deserved All The Honors	Wow , what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored , not the garbage they salute today . In other words , this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time . Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race , for instance , perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects . This can be a very sad film as well . I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points . The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film . They can just tear you apart . The combination of drama , action and romance , along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack , once again one of the best ever put on film . The more one hears this music , the more was is moved by it . To fully appreciate the cinematography in this film I recommend you purchase the recently-released 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story , the silent movie " Ben-Hur : A Tale Of The Christ . " That was name of the book , by the way , the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films . However , there is a reverence for Jesus Christ in this film , which should be there since it's a key element of the storyline , even though most folks forget that . In summary , this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an " epic " movie . It's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen .
525337	4445210	26210	10.0	Fantastic - Really Good Sight Gags	After the first few minutes it looked like this was going to be a fairly weak Popeye cartoon but - wow - it got terrific and stayed that way until the end . The attraction : a lot of legitimately funny and clever sight gags . There is no Bluto in this one , which is a nice change-of-pace but we have a villain , a mustachioed-guy who looks like the old silent-era villain " Oil Can Harry " who would tie up women and leave them on the railroad tracks . Here , this villain is handcuffed early on by Wimpy , who is a cop , believe it or not . However , predictably , Wimpy is inept and quickly he loses the criminal he has handcuffed to him when he gets distracted by - you guessed it - hamburgers . The crook just happens to have a coat full of skeleton keys and other escape mechanisms so he splits and heads for the nearby Popeye's Pawn Shop That's where the real fun starts and I wouldn't want to spoil it . Suffice to say you see a lot of wild scenes between the criminal , Popeye and Olive and some duels you can't believe . The name of this cartoon refers to all the various weapons these guys use in their duels . To this day , this is a very original material which I haven't seen on any other cartoons .
525068	4445210	810095	10.0	Nothing Tops This Is , If You Like SRV	I read someone say once that if you really want a composite of what Stevie Ray Vaughan was all about , musically , all you need is this DVD . I totally agree . I have a half dozen SRV discs or tapes but nothing tops this . You get two concerts , one on each disc . The first is the " controversial " 1982 concert at Montreux ( in Switzerland ) and the other is the 1985 return trip to Montreux . The first was " controverial " in the reception Vaughan and his band received during and immediately after the performing : booing ! It is shocking to hear . I've never heard an artist booed on a disc put out for public release , but it's in here . ( There were a lot of cheers , too . ) Of course , the booing and catcalls were totally unwarranted . The band was excellent and Stevie was tremendous , but the crowd was expecting what they had heard all day : quiet , acoustic blues guitar . When SRV turned up the amps and did his thing , some of them didn't like it . Nonetheless , I liked it and chances are you will , too , if you are a fan of his , or simply blues / rock . What I liked best were a couple of his long , slow numbers , such as " Dirty Pool . " On that disc is a documentary , with band members Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon , discussing that ' 82 concert and what happened afterward . Jackson Browne also gives his take on his participation in helping out SRV and the band . It's pretty interesting . By 1985 , the crowd knew all about SRV and gave him a great reception and he put on the best show , perhaps , I have ever seen him ( and the band ) do - just electrifying . In fact , there are four straight numbers - Tiny Pan Alley ( a . k . a . Roughest Place In Town , Look At Little Sister , Voodoo Chile and Texas Flood - that are done so well that I had tears in my eyes . That is THE best version Vaughan has ever done on the Jimi Hendrix number ( Voodoo Chile ) and you have to just see and hear this to believe it . SRV pulls out all the stops , doing things with a guitar I've never seen before . Trust me on this one : this is the Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble DVD to get , above all others .
527542	4445210	1338677	10.0	What We've Come To Expect From ' Sid ' - Laughs	" Sid the Sloth , " a hilarious co-star in the Ice Age animated feature films , stars in this short . . . . . and doesn't disappoint . This is one funny sloth , and one humorous and clever cartoon . We get a " cameo " from " Scat , " too , which is always a good thing . Also , the artwork is spectacular , at least on Blu-Ray . This really looks fantastic . Sid's a camp counselor here and - you guessed it - a pretty inept one . The kids are wise-guys but Sid has a few zingers , too , giving one kid " a merit badge for whining . " John Leguizamo does his normal superb job of voicing " Sid . " He has a couple of his children doing voice-work in here , too , according to the ending credits . In the end , we find out how Sid was instrumental in forming the Grand Canyon . I kid you not . I saw this as a bonus feature on the " Horton Hears A Who " Blu-Ray DVD . If you have the DVD , don't miss this feature ; you'll really laugh .
522971	4445210	351283	10.0	Lived Up To Good Reputation - Funny , Colorful	Here's another recently-made animated film that has two outstanding characteristics which make it a winner : 1 - consistently funny humor that adults can enjoy , and 2 - beautiful , bold colors . When a movie is both fun to hear and to watch , I have very few complaints . This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids . I can't say that for sure , since I watched it by myself . . . . but I sure got my share of laughs This is a tale of four zoo animals that wind up in the wilds . To be more precise , they go from the big zoo in New York City to the wilds of Madagascar , an island near Africa . Wherever these " guys " are - the lion , zebra , hippo and giraffe - they are entertaining . Ben Stiller and Chris Rock , voicing the lion ( " Alex " ) and zebra ( " Marty " ) , respectively , are the two main characters . Jada Pinkett Smith's hippo ( " Gloria " ) and and David Schwimmer's hypochondriac giraffe ( " Melman " ) provide solid support . The main thing is that all the characters , including supporting ones , are likable and funny in their own way . Every character is quite different . The story movies exceptionally fast so the hour-and-a-half is easy to watch . Maybe the best thing I can say is that I heard a lot of good things about this before watching it , and it lived up to its hype . That's not easy to do .
525774	4445210	26109	10.0	Grampy Is A Hoot !	Betty gets a telegram from Grampy to come over to his house " for a little party " and " come right over and bring the gang , " he adds . " Ohh , " she shrieks , and puts on her hat and heads right over . As she is singing about " Gramy's house " while strutting down the street , she is joined by people who overhear her lyrics and tag along . They literally drop everything ( i . e . piano ) and follow her . The rest of the cartoon shows the amazing inventions in Grampy's house and , believe me , they are a hoot to see and hear ( such as the clever way he produces music for the party . ) This is great stuff - a " feel-good " cartoon , if I ever saw one .
524972	4445210	923999	10.0	The Long Wait Was Worth It - A Fabulous Concert !	Well , I certainly waited a long time for this ! I expected this DVD out around 2000 since the first concert tape was out n 1994 and the second in 1997 . Then , after attending his concert live n 2003 in Buffalo , k I thought that a DVD would be our for sure later that year or 23004 at the very latest . Anyway , when it finally came out late in 2006 , I wasn't disappointed . Most of the songs , thankfully , are new material . How much other new stuff I heard in the three-hour Buffalo concert that wasn't on this DVD , I don't know but I'm not complaining . There are a couple of surprises in here , such as two solo violinists , a dulcimer player , and a flashy harpist-singer . The other new people I knew sin ' 97 I had seen in that Buffalo concert . A shock was not seeing violinist Karen Briggs on this DVD . She had always been a staple in Yanni's tour concerts in the past 10 years and - next to the Yanni himself - the key performer and most recognizable one in past DVDs . I don't know what happened to her . However , Sayaka Katsuki , from Japan , who replaced her , is just fine . Katsuki and Armenian violinist Samvel Yervinyan make a dynamite duo , with the Russian being the best of th two , I think . He is fantastic . Both of them do a number of solos , in one song trading off each other . I really enjoyed the sound of Dan Landrum on hammer dulcimer . That was a nice addition to the orchestra . Still the most versatile and best musician in the entire band is Pedro Eustache , who was with Yanni in his 1997 concert in China and India . He's gained some weight and some hair since then but is still animated , talented and fun to watch . You can tell he's Yanni's right-hand man . Not far behind is keyboard player Ming Freeman , another holdover from the China concert . Trumpet player Ramon Flores was a nice surprise . I'm not a big fan of that sound , but his playing is tremendous . All the soloists are excellent . I like them all , and could go on and on . The two female singers , Alfreda Gerald , who has always been with Yanni , and newcomer Michelle Amato , both excel . Longtime drummer Charlie Adams - who played with Yanni in the first Acropolis concert DVD but not on the second , was back , but , for the first time , did not have a solo or at least one that was included on the DVD . Of the new songs , th driving-beat , fast selections seem to be the best and generate the most enthusiasm among the crowd ( and me , too . ) Songs such as " Rainmaker , " " On Sacred Ground , " " Playtime , " " For All Seasons " and " World Dance " will all have you tapping your feet , moving your hands , etc . They are great feel-good songs and perhaps the trademark of these Yanni Orchestra presentation . Of the older songs , the re-make of " Nostalgia " was tremendous , thanks to the added dramatic violin work of Yervinyan . This is just a fabulous concert , filmed in Las ? egas sometime , I think , in 2005 . I watched this 7-8 times the first two months I owned it and loved it more and more each time . I just hope the next Yanni DVD doesn't take another 9-plus years to be released .
526066	4445210	395479	10.0	Great Message Uniquely Presented	This is about as a nice a message as I have ever seen presented in a cartoon , and it's presented in a beautiful manner . This is just plain fun to watch but even better to hear . The message is sung and the rhyming in the lyrics is just tremendous , really enjoyable . In less than a handful minutes , we are shown and given a wonderful mini-sermon , if you will , on how to handle bad situations and life in general . There also is a plug for skin color making no difference in your attitude , either . This might be the only cartoon I ever watched , and then replayed it a few minutes later . It was so good , I wanted to hear / see it again . There are some profound words of wisdom in this , sung in a catchy ditty . The animated short is offered as one of the features in the DVD of " The Incredibles . "
522417	4445210	120873	10.0	Very Worthy Sequel To A Great Film	This is an outstanding sequel to an outstanding movie The Fugitive ( 1993 ) . In this film , the focus is on the team that was searching for Dr . Richard Kimble in the first movie . That team was led by Tommy Lee Jones , who won an Oscar for his performance , which probably helped spur this sequel . It worked , as Jones and company ( Joe Pantoliano and others ) are just as much fun to watch as they were in The Fugitive . There are many similarities to the latter , especially in the first third of the film , featuring some tremendous action scenes . Instead of a train crash , we have a plane crash . Instead of Harrison Ford on the run , we have Wesley Snipes . In both films , you have such an involving story that the two hours fly by . U . S Marshals , being the newer film of the two , has better sound and even better special effects for the action scenes . As spectacular as was the train crash in The Fugitive , the plane disaster in here is even better . The same goes for a few other scenes . There is more action in this film . Normally , I don't need that but it's so well-done here , it's fine . . . . fun to watch . The Fugitive is still one of my all-time favorite movies . If you were entertained by it as well but are wary of sequels , you needn't be here : this is excellent .
524440	4445210	36775	10.0	Justifiably At The Top Of Most Film Noir Lists	This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well . I am still waiting for a DVD to come out that will give this film the treatment it deserves . Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining . . . . . at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray . I think it's a big appeal to this movie , except to younger folks who look at it as " cheesy . " I read the book , Double Indemnity written by James Cain , and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it . This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book . That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay , For a murder / suspense story , there is very little action , almost none , yet there are no boring lulls . The three main actors - Stanwyck , MacMurray and Edward G . Robinson , are what make this so good . MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback , from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson . The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance , the way he delivers his lines . He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen . Stanwyck was no sex symbol ( at least to me ) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and , like Robinson , has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention . This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie , " Body Heat , " starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner . That , too , was a very , very good movie . . . . but not many films are in the class of this one .
522691	4445210	1065626	10.0	This Gives You A Great Feel For Memphis And It's Blues Artists Over The Years	I liked this episode because you get a real taste of what it was ( and is ) like for a musician on tour , traveling thousands of miles on a bus . You get a feel for Memphis , a nice history of Beale Street , and a great feel for what it's like to be a blues artist back in " the old days " and " now " in that city . We get extensive looks at a relatively-unknown Bobby Rush and what he goes through and the little places he plays and then we get the contrasting " king of blues : " B . B . King , and his experiences . King is treated like royalty wherever he goes . It's quite a contrast , although B . B . certainly paid his dues over the years . It's just has Bobby has not stopped paying them . Some make it to stardom ; some don't , but once , as Rush says , the blues are in your blood you're not going to stop singing and playing . He's pretty lively for a 60-plus-year-old guy ! The scene with Rush and the woman in his act who shakes her booty has to be seen to be believed ! We also see quite a bit of another man who is well-known in Memphis but not so much outside of that city : Roscoe Gordon . He came across as a wonderful guy and I felt bad when they mentioned he died shortly after one of the last scenes in the documentary .
523723	4445210	801865	10.0	An Involving , Sad Story	A Navy-Marine corporal " Price " has been found dead in central park during Fleet Week . A highly-decorated combat veteran . . . . and there are no signs of a struggle ? Mac , Danny and Flack take the case . It turns out to be a puzzling case . The shocker is the second case . A charred body is found inside a car , an obvious torch job with someone trying to burn the body , not the car . Forensics discover it's a female and she had been severely beaten to death before the fire . Stella , Sheldon and Lyndsay investigate . A re-construction of the face reveals the stunning discovering that the victim is " Aiden Burn , " the CSI member from last year's show . Who killed her and why ? Needless to say , this part of the show is very intense and personal . This was an excellent episode and , as someone who liked Vanessa Ferlito ( " Aiden " ) and was sorry to see her leave the program last year , also a very sad one .
527376	4445210	59598	10.0	The Most Incredible And Funny Fly I've Ever Seen , And The Best Sound	The beginning of this Pink Panther cartoon certainly was different . Inserted in the animation were real-life , black-and-white pictures of various action scenes on an animated television set . We see a sleepy-eyed Panther with his remote control changing channels . ( I don't even remember having remote-controls back in the mid ' 60s ! ) . On the floor is a bunch of junk food ( with potato chips misspelled as " potatoe . " ) Anyway , the idea is the Panther is exhausted and wants some sleep . He goes to bed , begins to sleep but his loud snoring wakes himself up . Then , the big gag of the cartoon , after going back asleep again , a buzzing fly wakes him up and torments him . This fly is awesome ! After being booted out of house , he knocks on the door and gets back in ! Later , he finds another clever way to get back inside and dive bomb our trying-to-sleep hero . Still , later he finds an even-more totally outrageous way to get back in the house . Each time it gets funnier . For the first time ever , I appreciated the sound in here more than anything . The fly , the Panthers laughs , the fly's laugh , the noises made by fly as he did various things . . . . . all of them are extremely funny . This is a terrific PP cartoon ; one of the best .
524641	4445210	86034	10.0	Bond As Indiana Jones	Was there ever a James Bond like this one ? Oh , there were better Bond stories , no doubt , but I do doubt there were any more entertaining than this one . In " Octopussy , " we get more of an Indiana Jones-type adventure story than the usual spy farce . In fact , there is so much adventure in here it gets tiring , to be frank . It's almost too much . . . . but it is a lot of fun along the way . The best part of the film isn't the wild adventure , either : it's the humor . This has more laughs in it - stupid and clever - than any Bond film I can recall . Roger Moore , Maud Adams , Louis Jordan , Kristina Wayborn , Steven Berkoff and Kabir Bedi must have had a lot of fun - and been worn out - making this film . By the way , itt's always interesting to see the intriguing Adams . This and " Goldfinger " are my two favorites of the Bond series , and I'm glad to see so many others here share that opinion .
