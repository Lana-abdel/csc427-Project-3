526504	4445210	87995	1.0	A Good Movie For Punks & Religious Bigots	The release date says " 1984 " but it might as well say some year in the 1970s because it had that sleazy look and hate-filled , anti-religious bias that was so prevalent in films in that decade . It usually didn't take these filmmakers long to get their religious cheap shots in , and that's the case here , too . Within 15 minutes , the was the usual dig against TV evangelists ( give it a rest ! ) and the people who listen to them , three usages of the Lord's name in vain and a ton of other profanities . it had that scummy ' 70s atmosphere right from the start . The lead character , " Otto Maddox , " ( Emilo Estavez ) is a real punk , too . This is another good example of Hollywood's hypocrisy of being " tolerant " to every group but Christians . Even if the bias doesn't bother you , the absence of a plot and the stupid dialog should . This is nothing but garbage . Punk-rockers , and just plain punks , love this film , and that should tell you something .
525537	4445210	175142	1.0	Another Sad Example Of Today's Comedies	Here's yet one more example of a modern-day comedy that has its funny moments but unfortunately , to me , was more of a sleaze-fest that a parody or a straight comedy . This movie is spoofing horror films . That's cool , I like a good spoof , but why all the irreverence and sex jokes ? Why is that necessary ? Don't writers today have the intelligence to make people laugh using clean material ? This is just one R-rated scene after another . The language is brutal , too : tons of profanity in this film . Funny , but comedies for years made the public laugh without having to resort to profanity and sex remarks , like this film does . The really sickening part is that movie was geared for a young audience . The film business has no shame . What passes for comedy films today is , by and large , low-class material . This movie is Exhibit A .
522695	4445210	1206157	1.0	In A Word : Embarrassing	Wow , what can you say about an episode like this ? I could say a lot , but I think I'll keep it pretty short : this was an embarrassment to watch . Don't these writers and actors have any dignity ? This is the kind of perverted humor that is so over-baked that it isn't funny ; it's like " Blades of Glory " or " The Love Guru . " It's just one sleazy joke after another . Hey , I love dark humor but not ten sex jokes every minute , especially on a crime show . Everyone on this episode but Warrick , I think , had some wise-guy remark about everything in here . Sex jokes are okay but come on , man - is this HBO with all this stuff ? After last year's great season with " The Miniature Killer , " I had hoped the CSI Las Vegas show and turned the corner from the gutter and gotten classy again . Wrong . Maybe this is why Jorja Fox , Gary Dourdan and William Petersen have all left the show .
526026	4445210	114148	1.0	Anoher Reason For The Disney Boycott	You wonder why there was a big boycott of Walt Disney films and Disney World in the mid ' 90s and shortly thereafter . It wasn't just " Gay Days " at the theme park : it was Liberal revisionist " history " movies like this . Instead of the real story of Pocahontas , who became famous by being the first Native American converted to Christianity , we get ridiculous New Age mumbo - jumbo here . Yeah , it's the typical Disney brainwashing ( this film is for young kids ) in which the message is to worship ( not just take care of ) trees , earth , and all living things . The Disney empire is so strong on its heavy-handed left-wing agenda that it can't even remotely tell the truth about a story in an animated film . At the very least , since they abhor Christianity , they should have just stuck with a pretty animated movie ( which this is ) and centered it around romance and young America . . . but Liberals can't stop being in your face all the time , pushing their secular agendas on the rest of us . This movie is " Exhibit A " of that - a disgrace .
526865	4445210	105017	2.0	I Never Did Like John Ritter	This was supposed to be " a hilarious farce , " according to reviews of the day . It just shows you how unreliable are the movie critics you read in the newspaper . The only " farce " was that this film was lauded . The first dozen minutes along totally turned me off . In that period . John Ritter used the Lord's name in vain at least three times . That , and hundred of other " Oh , God " this and " Oh , God " that were just way too much and too annoying . I usually like Michael Caine but he's had his share of lemons , as other actors have , and this is one of them . Add in the usually-annoying Carol Burnett , Julie Hagerty and Ritter and this is easy movie to dislike . From what I hear , the stage play was far better than this flat farce .
522676	4445210	112688	2.0	Little To Like From Spike	For the longest time , it has been - or was - politically-incorrect to criticize director Spike Lee , so he gets away with murder in a number of his overrated films . Lee , in his obnoxiousness because of this fawning , doesn't care or doesn't get it that most of America doesn't want to go to a film that has over 300 profanities in it and tons of drugs and violence . If he only cares about appeasing his crowd , okay , but that doesn't mean I have to like or praise everything he does , like Roger Ebert and the rest of them . For the uniformed - and we're better off , in this case - " clockers " is a ghetto term for " drug runners or dealers . " In this story , it's drug dealers and cops , innocent people and thugs and an investigation ( is Mekhi Phifer's " Strike " guilty or innocent ? ) to get it all sorted out . Unfortunately , it takes too long for all of this to happen . In between the million f-words , and more preaching by the racist director , you have to put up with music that was so loud it drowned out the dialog a number of times . Maybe that wasn't so bad .
524959	4445210	26497	2.0	This'Short ' About Sleep Will Do Just That	Robert Benchley discusses the subject of sleep in four parts : 1 - the causes of sleep ; 2 - the methods of inducing sleep ; 3 - methods of avoiding sleep and , finally , 4 - how to wake up ( " which is the most important , " he notes . ) Early on this showed promise to a funny " short , " but it really wasn't . After five or six minutes , it got simply boring . The third segment comprised most of the overall time and went on way too long . Yes , some of it was mildly amusing , mainly the names he put to various sleepng positions , but that's about it . Actually , as someone who has a lot of trouble sleeping , it was amazing : this short film almost put me to sleep !
523130	4445210	78754	2.0	He's Not Your ' Average Joe , ' Thankfully !	Well , how about two hours of film footage about a chain-smoking , drug-taking , wife - cheating , hard-drinking , profane guy ? Sound like fun ? I don't think so . Roy Scheider plays " Joe Gideon , " who is really Ray Fosse , the famous dance choreographer . The story is based on Fosse's life . . . . and it isn't a pretty one . I really liked the photography in this movie - that IS pretty , but the main character , as described above , was not a fun guy to watch . " Sordid " is an apt word for this biography . I'm sorry , but I am not attracted to depressing stories about people who are losers . It has nothing to do with Scheider , either , who I have always found to play interesting roles . This is painful story to watch and it's long : two-and-a-half hours . It could have been edited in a number spots , although it still would have been too sleazy a story for me .
524362	4445210	105682	2.0	Simply Boring , Not Much Else	The only things worth watching and hearing in this French film are Emmanuelle Beart's face and some of Ravel's violin music , respectively . Otherwise , this is an incredibly boring movie ; a very long , drawn out soap opera . It's nothing but people yakking away . The fact national critics rave about this movie is mind-boggling . The film has little offer , even sleaze , which critics love . For those looking at the cover of the DVD box or VHS tape and thinking this might be some kind of erotic French film , forget it . There is no sex nor certainly anything erotic Unfortunately , this is very little worthy of anyone's attention .
523102	4445210	95638	3.0	Political Propaganda That's Full Of Beans	This started off so well , with some absolutely beautiful New Mexico scenery , I had high hopes . Unfortunately , they were dashed the rest of the way as director Robert Redford had to shout his Left Wing politics loud and clear in our face . So what we wind up with is a low-down , dishonest greedy Right Wing big businessman running the poor little guys out of town and only those good-guy liberal activist minorities saving the day . We even get a dose of Christian bigotry here where those poor picked-on-pagan gods are run out by Christians ! Well , you just know what side is going to win : yes , those wonderful left wingers , adored by the film industry . This VHS went into a garbage can where it belonged . Adios ! !
525394	4445210	61417	3.0	The Weakest In The Series	This was the first really weak effort I've seen in this animated series . It's not horrible , but the jokes are not funny , just flat , and the story is too ridiculous to entertain anyone over the age of five . A little green man from Mars comes by in a spaceship and kidnaps The Commissioner . Moments later , The Inspector and Deux-Deux find a spaceship and head out to save him . The two are parachuted to the planet , discover their boss in some big underground tunnel and try to rescue him . It's all really juvenile ; not the normal fare . Not all of the 17 cartoons I have seen in this series were winners . Some were disappointing , but this probably the weakest effort in the lot .
524925	4445210	105108	4.0	Not The Usual Rugged Rutger	This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was . . . . simply a tense thriller . Yes , the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious . Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued , not playing his normal intense character . Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing . The story is so-so . It's not as bad as I'm making out , but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again , and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading .
526444	4445210	35646	4.0	A Weak Start To This Short Series	Well , after reading a couple of the other reviews here , I feel a little better . I thought maybe I missed something , thinking this animated short was pretty weak . Apparently , others agree . It might have been a landmark of sorts with the introduction of Claude The Cat and the two mice , Hubie ( his name wasn't mentioned in this cartoon ) and Bertie , but that doesn't mean it was entertaining . It wasn't , except for some of the artwork . This was the first of seven " Hubie and Bertie " cartoons . Claude was just not-funny stupid , and sadistic . Forced to fend for himself after " Meadows " the butler quits after being abused by the cat , Claude finds himself clueless . He has no idea how to do anything for himself . Apparently he doesn't even know what a mouse or a dog looks like , despite the fact there is a dog in the house . When he encounters the mice , he is scared out of his mind and runs for the hills . Finally , he winds up talking to them and they take advantage of the situation . Overall , this offers almost nothing in the way of laughs except one quick scene when Claude first meets the bulldog , face-to-face .
522978	4445210	104797	4.0	Slick But Spiked With Too Much Bias	Here we go with more Spike Lee bias . I'm not talking blacks vs . whites . We've come to expect that with Lee's films . What I'm referring to in this picture is another thing Lee does in many of his films - take cheap shots at Christians . What better stage than this one about a man who leaves his Christian roots and converts to Islam ? Here , Lee goes out of his way to have the KKK mentioned several times and how they are " good Christians . " An accomplice to many of Lee's bigoted films , unfortunately , is the fine actor Denzel Washington . Check how often Washington and Lee collaborate on films and how many of them play the " race card . " Too bad because Denzel is a likable guy and a great actor . Lee is neither . At 201 minutes this a long film but an interesting one nonetheless . I can't say I was ever bored watching this . It's also beautifully photographed with some slick visuals . You can tell a lot of love went into this movie . Too bad Lee can't put this much effort into a biography of , let's say , Martin Luther King , Mother Teresa or Billy Graham .
525048	4445210	303336	4.0	Glad ' For The Birds ' Beat This Out	I agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased " For The Birds " won the Oscar in 2002 for " Best Animated Short , " not this sick material , which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone , of course , who has no belief in heaven or hell . The animation was good , but so are a lot of animated shorts . And , by the way , I love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start . As for the story here : a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey ( symbolism here ) is told by a TV set ( which appears every few hundred yards away ) that he is in either heaven , hell , or purgatory . Each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news . I guess that would be funny in two of the three instances .
523573	4445210	36174	4.0	Humor Too Dated To Work Now	The story here was just a little too boring and the humor just not funny enough . It added up to a film that was too boring to watch . That was further surprising because the cast was good : Cary Grant , Lariaine Day , Charles Bickford and Henry Stephenson . Grant may be the only big " star " in that group but I've always found Bickford and Stephenson to play interesting guys and Day had to have about the prettiest eyes I've ever seen . They just sparkle and it makes her face mesmerizing at times . Unfortunately , that wasn't enough to make me impressed over this film . It's simply too dated , humor-wise . I don't know how it was received in 1943 , whether audiences laughed a lot at this but , unlike dramas , westerns , crime movies , etc . , comedies can look very dated very quickly and today's audiences would not laugh at this .
524316	4445210	43983	5.0	Dancing Great ; Story Stinks	This movie features some of the most famous dance scenes by Fred Astaire , such as the one where he dances on the walls and ceiling . That particularly dance is impressive because the special-effects made it look realistic . Kudos to the filmmakers for doing that in a film that is 55 years old . Astaire also did a clever number earlier with a hat rack and did two entertaining dances with Jane Powell . The dancing was the only good thing in the film . Most of the story deals with romances between Powell and Peter Lawford and Astaire and Sarah Churchill . The latter look a little old for the normal young-romance type angles viewers are used to seeing in films . Facially , Fred looked like he had been ill . He just didn't look good . Powell looked fine but her soprano voice almost broke my TV tube . It was brutal . Since those famous Astaire dances can be seen on " That's Entertainment " tapes or DVDs , there was no reason to keep this film .
522496	4445210	95647	5.0	Great Acting , But Overdone Stereotypes & Bias	This was a very intense story about three missing civil rights workers in 1964 and the U . S . government looking into that disappearance ( and murder ) in Mississippi , where it happened . On first viewing , I really enjoyed this because of the top-rated performance by the lead actors Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe and the fact that the story was interesting . However , on subsequent viewings , the ultra-Liberal bias of the people making this movie became more and more evident . Typical of Liberal elitists , they make every Southerner in this film ( but one ) look like very stupid , extremely racist hicks - the kind of people who want to strangle yourself . Hey , no one argues that racism is bad , bad thing but this goes to ridiculous extremes while giving cheap shots to Christians , as well . That's another typical feature of liberal bias . They have no problem showing us those slimeballs who are anti-Semitic , as also portrayed here , but at the same time the people who make the films can't hide their own anti-Christian bias . Too bad because Hackman and Dafoe are superb and the story moves very well . It's a fast two hours of film " entertainment . " Note : beware the language is very rough with way too many usages of the Lord's name in vain .
523150	4445210	95532	5.0	Involving , But Only So-So Overall	This was a fairly involving story , although it's better in the first half . After that , the kid gets annoying but then the film picks back up in the last 15 minutes . The story is about this teen boy " Jeff Grant " ( River Phoenix ) who discovers his parents are " sleepr " KGB agents , spies are out of the business . They have come to the United States to start over with their kid . Meanwhile , an assassin is killing those former , or " sleeper , " if you will , agents . " Roy Parmenter " ( Sidney Poitier ) , an FBI man , is after anyone it seems . That last part is a bit confusing . The story taxes ones believability here and there but is interesting most of the way . However , I thought Phoenix overacts in a number of scenes . This was far from his best performance in his abbreviated film career .
526783	4445210	34845	5.0	Liked The Slang , But Little Else	I love to hear the slang of the day , whatever decade , and this one has a lot of it of the ' 40s beginning with the title . For those you don't know , " hep " used to mean " hip " or " cool " or whatever . Here , it's cat who struts his stuff in words , song and dance . He spots this hot female feline and is smitten . The trouble is this stupid dog - and he is portrayed as really stupid at times , clever at other times - keeps interfering . Getting back to the slang : just read the note the Hep Cat receives one day : " Dear Gorgeous Hunk , If you would like to pitch some woo - come back to the fence for a rendezvous ! " I love it ! Words like " hunk , " come back around every other generation but " woo " has been out of our vocabulary since about 1950 . Unfortunately , this was the only funny thing in the cartoon . I enjoyed the artwork and the direction the humor was not much . There seems to be a big difference in a lot of these Looney Tunes , depending on the decade . The early ' 50s still hold up well today , but some of these ' 40s are too dated to be funny .
525986	4445210	87553	5.0	Powerful Drama But Hard To Watch	It's been over 20 years since I saw this film and parts of it still haunt me . . . . . brutal , emotional scenes which I do NOT want to see ever again . It's just too gut-wrenching and uncomfortable to sit through a second time . Generally , it's two hours of suffering and torture . Who wants to watch that ? It IS a powerful story , though , based on the true life adventures of Dith Pran ( played by Haing S . Ngor ) who somehow survived the unbelievably-brutal regime of Cambodia dictator Pol Pot . Other reviewers here have detailed the storyline , so there is no sense me rehashing that . Suffice to say this is a movie that - be warned - is very tough to view in many spots - but will leave you emotionally drained . Ngor's harrowing performance is one to remember , as is the horrible story of what happened in the mid ' 70s in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge . This movie was filmed with Thailand and the scenery there , along with the excellent cinematography , makes this a visual treat . Some have complained that the film is too slow for them . Others didn't like this because it was overtly anti-American in some regards ( the bombing of Cambodia ) . I can understand those complaints . What bothered me most was that I just found the whole based-on-a-true happening story too sad .
523542	4445210	60738	5.0	Being Blown Up Only Gets Him Dirty	This was okay , but nothing super and certainly not as good as the first two on the DVD " The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , Vol . 6 - Inspector Cartoons . One thing it had that the first two didn't have was a laugh track which is stupid beyond belief . I don't need to be told when to laugh at a cartoon . Fortunately , it was subdued , but the principle of it annoys me . This is a one-joke cartoon , that of " The Mad Bomber , " a little furry creature , planting bombs all over the place to blow up the Commissioner , the inspector's boss and the man who put the " boomer , " as Clouseau pronounces it , behind bars . The Commish gets blown up many times , but outside of getting soot all over him , he seems to survive each one with no problem . The best part of this cartoon , by far , was the artwork . There are some really good drawings in here , both of a big mansion and at the French Riviera and other places . It may not provide a lot of laughs , but it was a treat for the eyes .
523253	4445210	1041253	5.0	Surprisingly-Boring For A Season-0pener	I can't recall , although there must have been at least one , any CSI episode that I could label as " boring . " The stories might get a little too wacky here and there - especially this Las Vegas one - but they never dragged . . . . . . until this one . Usually , a lot is going on in a CSI episode , whether it is one crime being solved or three at once . Here , however , it's just trying to find a person : CSI employee " Sara Sidle , " who is trapped underneath a car somewhere out in the desert . The question is " where ? " The only person who knows is the " Miniature Killer " who is in some sort of mental state in which she's unable to communicate . Thus , the whole show is trying to find out where Sara is , plus showing Sara trying to get out from underneath the car . Being a regular on the show since Day One , you know Jorja Fox ( " Sara " ) is going to make it , so I didn't feel much suspense . One just observes how she's found , and it's a very slow , drawn out story with very little , frankly , happening .
523775	4445210	18061	5.0	Not As Clever As The Earlier Ones	This was one of those cartoons that amused audiences a lot more 80 years ago than it does today . Oddly , I found that the Koko The Clown cartoons earlier in the decade a lot more clever than this late silent-film entry . Maybe Max and Dave had run out of ideas on how to make Koko and the " Out of the Inkwell " material entertaining as much as they were in the previous years . Who knows . However , it wasn't long after the " talkies " began that these guys hit it big with Popeye The Sailor Man , beginning in 1933 . Most of this story is simply about Koko and some other little creature - kind of strange - looking pup - going backwards and then making time actually go backwards for everyone else , animated or real ! It sounds better than it played . ( Showing slow scenes of everyday life : smoke going into a chimney , traffic going backwards , people walking backwards , etc . , really isn't humorous . . . . at least not in 2007 . Hey , you can't win ' em all . Most of these Koko cartoons I've watched have been super .
522992	4445210	96028	5.0	A Grim Subject	This is a movie made in India about a young boy who is forced out into the streets of Bombay , where he sells tea , associates with drug dealers , has his money stolen , on and on , good and bad - mostly bad . It's a depressing story with little to offer on the bright side . The video box said there is no sex , no violence and no objectionable language . Well , two-of-three ain't bad . I would consider the f-word perhaps " objectionable " to a few people . Amazing how out of touch movie producers and critics are . Speaking of critics , this film always gets high marks from them , so you know it's overrated . However , it is an interesting study of a depressing subject . That's the best I can describe it .
527366	4445210	933357	5.0	Life Is More Than ' Chance '	This is an animated story about " chance " and " coincidence " ruling our lives , something the author apparently believes because it's stated by narrator in the first few sentences of the film that " we are all just seeds floating up there in the space waiting for someone to get us . " With an atheistic outlook like that , it's no wonder this won an Oscar for " best animated short . " Had the opposite belief been put into film , it wouldn't have stood a chance to be nominated . Anyway , Torill Kove , a Norwegian animator / filmmaker and current resident of Canada , gives us this " cute " story in which a series of circumstances all make for a happy ending . The illustrations are half the fun of watching this 15-minute award-winning short . They artwork is clean and colorful and a treat for the eyes . Liv Ullman does a nice job of narrating the film but I would have rather had a variety of voices . Having a female voice all the male characters sounded out of place . I wouldn't be surprised if Miss Kove did this story tongue-in-cheek , knowing that actually everything happens for a reason , not that all of life is sheer chance . No one is dumb enough to believe that , which is why this is a good fairy tale .
522448	4445210	35583	5.0	Yes , Rita Never Looked Lovelier , But Story Was Never As Stupid !	Boy , here we go again . It's too bad they had to have just stupid stories in these Fred Astaire movies , especially with the gorgeous and talented Rita Hayworth as his partner . Ginger Rogers was great in her roles as Astaire's most-often dance partner but nobody looked as awesome as Hayworth in the early-to-mid ' 40s . In one of the numbers here , she wears a short mini-type skirt so you also get to enjoy her great legs . Her dance scenes with Astaire are almost worth the price of the film . I say " almost " because , as usual , the story was stupid , insulting anyone's intelligence and not fun to watch . Adolphe Menjou spent the entire movie being gruff and crabby , anything but entertaining . The romance angle was typical for it's film era , which is not a compliment . Just fast-forward to the dance scenes and you have a film that's watchable .
523458	4445210	87065	5.0	For Kids Only	This started off very strong with a fun spoof of James Bond-type spy movies with Dabney Coleman playing a secret agent using funny gimmicks in a short action scene . After that it settled down into a story of a young boy , " Davey Osborne , " ( Henry Thomas ) who accidentally stumbles onto real-life spies and with the help of his imaginary super-hero , eludes them as they chase him down . The familiar storyline of nobody believing the young boy got tiresome quickly and the cloak - and-dagger scenes were too juvenile for adults to enjoy . The kids might like as the focus is entirely on " Davey " and his little friend " Kim , " who , by the way , is very annoying and a poor actress . Coleman , meanwhile , plays a double role : the " invisible " hero and " Davey's " real-life father .
525825	4445210	25164	5.0	A Glimpse At What Was To Come	This was a typical Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movie which means one really good thing and one really bad thing . You could count on both for the remaining films these two entertainment giants did together over the next decade . THE GOOD - great dancing , as always , and a little humor thrown into the mix ; THE BAD - a stupid story filled with people who are misunderstood and another slam at marriage , trivializing it once again . This was the first film in which this famous duo were paired in leading roles . Have you noticed Astaire always looked the same age for at least two decades ? Rogers really looks young here . She exhibits a nice singing voice , too . Astaire sings more in this movie than in later films . The musical highlight is a very long song-and-dance number near the end , done to the tune " The Continental . " That helps make up for the stupid story . Alice Brady makes repeated attempts at humor but falls short most of the time . The same goes for Edward Everett Horton , who seems to play these annoying roles in many films . A very young Betty Grable is seen early on in the film in a Busby Berkeley-type number .
524358	4445210	44706	5.0	' Coop ' Should Have Shot Kelly !	High Noon This " actual " 85 minutes , went by fast when I saw this movie as a kid . I thought it was very suspenseful . Today , yikes . . . . this film goes by at a snail's pace and features two annoying main characters that make this a dud , not the revered classic gem that is supposed to be . There is nothing wrong with the hero , played by Gary Cooper . His overall presence - the way he handles himself , the expressions on his face , etc . - make him a believable and likable character , as he was in most of his films . Grace Kelly certainly is easy on the eyes ( I'm a male ) but her character in here is unbelievably shallow and annoying . She plays Cooper's wife and , get this - five minutes after she marries him , she wants to leave him because he decides he has to stay and fight off the bad man who is coming to town to kill him . Talk about devotion ! Talk about commitment ! No wonder marriage was never taken seriously in Hollywood and its films . The other characters who gets decent screen time is a whining punk with a chip of his shoulder . Lloyd Bridges plays that role effectively but his character wears thin quickly . The rest of the star-studded cast have very small roles , unfortunately . The movie is played out in " real time . " Watching an hour-and-a-half of this might be worth your real time if you are hoping to take a nap and need some help
527442	4445210	979456	6.0	The Divorce Case From Hell	Wow , do they have over-the-top obnoxious people in this episode , led by a ridiculous couple going through a divorce . " Nasty " doesn't cover it describing this couple , " Hank and Laurie Atherton , " who are beyond bitter and vindictive . The problem was having to listen to these two jerks periodically during the show . The couple's two lawyers are almost as obnoxious and annoying , too . Having to hear these four idiots - and others ( like the " pool guy " ) - lessened the entertainment value of this episode . Although it was good to see them get their due . Anyway , in a nutshell , several people connected with this couple are found dead and the CSI team has to figure it all out . On top of that , poor Eric Delko has to go through more b . s . as his competence is questioned by one of suspects . It was fairly interesting but certainly not a likable episode .
525759	4445210	95742	6.0	Freddy''s Funniest Film	This doesn't have the well-known cast of the previous Nightmare 3 movie but the special effects are still good . . . . . each very different and some of them very funny . They make this perhaps the most entertaining entry in the series . Memorable scenes include a junkyard , a water bed , a classroom , faces in a pizza , a girl bench pressing and faces coming out of Freddy's flesh . The storyline , however , features its usual dumb and ridiculous theology and has its usual share of unlikable obnoxious teens . Their parents weren't pictured as any better , perhaps worse . In fact , the kids and parents are so bad you wind up rooting for Freddy to do them in . Perhaps that's the idea !
523065	4445210	95489	6.0	Overall , It's Cute & Colorful	There are some beautiful colors in this animated film , nice golden hues mixed with purples that are very pleasing to see . The lead character is likable little guy called " Littlefoot . " Most of the scenes with the T-Rex might be a little scary for the little kids . The little dinosaurs are all ones you laugh with and enjoy . There are touches of New Age and secular humanism in here , which is no surprise , that being especially expected with a Steven Spielberg film , even an innocent cartoon adventure . However , all in all , pretty good and a decent hour-and-a-half of animated entertainment that adults should enjoy , too .
523494	4445210	34959	6.0	A ' Brutal ' Typical 1930s Prison Flick	When I see old-time prison / crime movies , I laugh out loud at some of the things I see , at least compared to films of the last 40 years which may be very profane and sadistically violent but at least they are realistic . In this film , the lead female character " Dot Burton , " played by Faye Emerson , is sent to a women's prison . Inside are all white women except one black , who dances all the time . Talk about a stereotype . Emerson and her best buddy in here look like lesser versions of Rita Hayworth , Look around and you more of these nice , wholesome-looking babes . I guarantee you no prison population has ever looked this good ! Yes , there are a few " baddies " and , of course , they are ugly women . The story also gives us a typical classic movie romance in which a guy falls in love with a " dame " the first time he talks to her . Then she falls for him quickly and but right away , of course , there is a misunderstanding and now the woman hates him . Ten minutes later she loves him again , then hates him , then loves him , etc . etc . No wonder few people in the film world ever took marriage seriously . On screen , it was just one big joke . Anyway , the story is pretty interesting even if it is more than a bit too dated . The film might be noted more for having two very young actors in here than anything else , guys who went on to because famous on television in the 1950s : Paul Drake and Jackie Gleason . Drake was Perry Mason's assistant on hat hit TV show and Gleason , of course , went on to huge TV fame with " The Honeymooners " and other shows . Here , he is billed as Jackie C . C Gleason . " Lady Gangster " is only a little over an hour which is fine and the DVD transfer was surprisingly good . This was part of a 4-movie disc called " Mobster Movies , " put out by Platinum . I have two of these discs so there are eight films I can watch , movies that , as far as I can tell , were not available on VHS . The other movie I watched on one of the other discs did not have the good picture quality this one had , so they probably vary from film-to-film . But , despite the drawbacks , these 1930s films are fun to watch because they are fast-moving , short and entertaining .
522986	4445210	95270	6.0	The Name ' Corny Collins ' Says It All	This fast-moving film had a number of good and bad things going for or against it . . . . at least with me . It was very corny , but that was the idea . In fact , one of the characters is named " Corny Collins . " It was pretty charming film , too , with the put-ons about the old American Bandstand-type dance shows that were television for years . " Hairspray " features some good 1960s music , too . The first half of this movie is about local teens of that period and the dance and petty jealousies in the group while the second half theme is all about racism . When I saw this movie in the mid ' 90s , I was shocked to see talk show host Ricki Lake in here , and looking so young and fat . She was way overweight , but was a good dancer . ( Some of the dances in here are hilarious . ) Her mother in the film was played by transvestite " Divine . " Yes , this is a another movie by the sick director John Waters who loved to feature Divine in his films , this being probably the most tame story he put on screen . The film takes place in Baltimore , and whether racism in that city was a bad as Waters portrays it here , I don't know , but I wouldn't be happy if I lived in that city and saw this movie . However , this film is like " Leave It To Beaver " combined to some of the other stuff Waters has produced over the years .
524171	4445210	43564	6.0	Colorful , But Not Too Humorous	Bugs , hiding inside a crate of carrots , winds up on the streets of Paris when the crate falls off the truck . He then meanders down the street and is spotted by competing chefs . They both think the rabbit is what they need to complete their menus . The colors in here are magnificent as they make Paris look really colorful . Our bunny hero , as he usually does , makes fools of his opponents in a variety of ways that makes them look really stupid . In this case , one of the chefs is a little too stupid for humor . Although there were a handful of funny lines at the expense of the French stereotypes at the time , this really wasn't one of the better Bugs Bunny efforts .
522298	4445210	35664	6.0	An Unusual War Movie	For a war movie , this was a bit unusual in that almost the whole film took part in one place . You could almost make a play out of this . A group of men stay in one area trying to sabotage a bridge so the Japanese can't use it to transport supplies . Meanwhile , they have to fend off attacks by the enemy . The closing scenes feature that attack and some are quite brutal . At least half of the story is not action but melodramatic looks at the soldiers , particularly of the squad's sergeant leader Robert Taylor and one of his men who has an attitude problem : Lloyd Nolan . We also get some shorter profiles of combat men played by Robert Walker , Thomas Mitchell and Desi Arnez ( yes , Lucy's husband ) . The special effects are more than passable considering they weren't too advanced in the film industry compared to today's technology . However , credibility was a little thin as those Japanese soldiers died awfully fast in those combat scenes at the end . I swear I saw several of them drop over before anyone hit them ! Taylor was the best in this movie " army " and Walker was the annoying character , playing an extremely young and generally stupid Navy guy ( don't ask ) who never stopped talking in this irritating voice . Other than his character , this was a tough , no-nonsense war movie .
526689	4445210	684279	6.0	Red Was A Great Ad-Libber	Red Skelton's show was a little bit like Burns & Allen in that the star would come out and give a monologue before the actual story of the episode took place . While George Burns might have talked for a minute or two , Skelton expanded that to also include a little pantomime skit . I also liked Sketon's monologues , as seen here , because they sounded so natural , not rehearsed . You know he ad-libbed certain things that would come to mind . Here , he interjects about being ill recently and show's producers surprised he showed up at rehearsals . All the time , he's laughing and making jokes about it . In all , six minutes before had elapsed before the actual " George Appleby's Garage " story began , but at 18 minutes with a lot of chaos , that was long enough . Skelton's ad-libbing in these skits seems to crack up the guest stars , particularly Jackie Coogan and they all have a good time in this " gangster " skit . It was a typical show where Red really put everything into it . I doubt if the humor , frankly , would go over today . It's sad to say but this kind of comedy has been replaced by a lot of raunchy , sex-oriented material . This stuff probably looks like caveman material to young folks of today .
522841	4445210	106188	6.0	No ' Groundhog Day , ' But It's Not Bad	This isn't as good as " Groundhog Day , " but it's not bad . I compare it to that film because a similar storyline with each day repeating itself . The main difference in this story is that it's a crime story in addition to the romance , and it doesn't have the likable lead characters the much more famous Groundhog Day had . Here , we get Jonathan Silverman , not exactly Bill Murray . Helen Slater , meanwhile , should have terminated her career after Supergirl . The movie also could have used a little better humor . Despite all these negatives there is something appealing about the film . Maybe it's just the interesting premise that once it hooks you in , has you to stay just so you can see if the hero is going to make everything right . For that , it gets five points but only a point for the rest . Still , if you see it on TV , check it out .
527048	4445210	51566	6.0	Runs The Gamut From Absurd To Routine	" Wardrobe " has two meanings for most people : 1 - A wardrobe ( sometimes called an " armoire " ) is a standing closet , sometimes called an " armoire " used for storing clothes . Sometimes it is in the form of a big trunk . 2 - a collection of wearing apparel ; a collection of stage costumes and accessories I know it as the second definition but in this movie , an early Roman Polanski film , it is a big " dresser , a large piece of furniture to store clothes and has a mirror in the middle of it . It looks big and tough for even two people to carry . So . . . . imagine the absurdity of the opening scene : two men appearing out of the ocean , walking to shore carrying this " wardrobe ! " That scenes sets up this strange 14-minute film , the first one of Polanski's to get public viewing . Polanski made films in Poland for the first five years of his career . I wonder what people there thought of this strange tale . This movie starts out strictly as a comedy , almost like an old silent film one because there is no dialog so all the humor is physical . However , it then delves into some other odd areas , such as animal abuse , some unexplained and non-eventful and very routine scenes with a girl , some fistfights . You just never know what will happen , all the while the two guys are carrying this huge wardrobe around . I left out mentioning a bunch of strange things so as not to spoil it . Like most of Polanski's early works , this is unusual stuff . My opinion is that many people would see this in many ways , and have a wide wide of likes and dislikes about it . One thing for sure : it's different . You can see this early Polanski effort on disc number 2 of the " Knife In The Water " DVD .
527424	4445210	71477	6.0	A Tough Call	This was made-for-TV movie shown about 30 years ago about the only American since the Civil War to be shot for desertion . Slovik ( Martin Sheen ) was a strange person and I didn't know how to react to this story , frankly . I knew Hollywood was going to give it its usual liberal bias , especially with Sheen in the starring role , so I tried to look at this objectively with no prejudices - something I don't see here with any of these reviews . Unfortunately , in trying to be totally neutral , it's easy to watch this film and come away with no definite stance . On one hand , you can't blame the military because it would be in chaos if every soldier who didn't want to fight could get out of it . That's ludicrous . On the hand , Slovik was such a nice , gentle guy , the death penalty for his actions seemed severe , too . Couldn't something else have been worked out ? I don't know , and at least I'm being honest . I never was in the military and maybe if I was , it would be an easier call . It is a tough call . . . . but at least the film - except for a couple of lulls with the romance angle - kept my attention and made me think about an issue , so it served its purpose .
525861	4445210	59800	6.0	A Real Mixed Bag Of Good & Bad	A typical early James Bond movie , filled with beautiful women , a sexist and suave spy can who can do little wrong ( Sean Connery as Bond ) , a few gadgets and a lot of action scenes . The gadgets , which are always fun , were fewer in number than usual , I am sorry to say . The action scenes , although interesting , had absolutely no credibility . Of course , that isn't anything new but they are particularly ludicrous here . Our hero eliminates almost everyone while no one hits him ! Also , there are a number of scenes in which Bond escapes from impossible situations and they never show how he did them . All of a sudden , he's pictured somewhere else . In addition , with so many foreign accents , it was difficult to understand the dialog , at least on tape when I last viewed this . Perhaps the DVD has English subtitles , which would help immensely . Otherwise , the filmmakers keep this lively story moving fast most of the time and if you are a male who likes ogle pretty women , you have a lot to choose from here beginning with Claudine Auger . Aftter a good start , the second hour of this film was disappointing . Overall , I'd have to say the same thing after watching the previous Bond class , " Goldfinger . "
523142	4445210	26135	7.0	Untalented & Unwanted . . . . . Until The End	A rooster , dog , cat and donkey all get the heave-ho from their farmer owner . Actually , the old man isn't all that mean ; the animals sleep on the job and deserved to get booted . They all cry the blues when the farm owner boots them in the butt but then things perk up when they notice a choir nearby singing . People throw coins from above and the singers go away happy . The animals figure , hey , let's try that gig , too . The trouble is , they're brutal at that , too . Instead of coins , people throw pots , pans and the kitchen sink at them . However , they may have little talent and aren't good workers , but they prove to be loyal to the farmer as we see in the dramatic final third of the story , which helps elevate this old cartoon from poor to fair . This cartoon was viewed on a DVD called " Cartoons That Time Forget : The UB Iwerks Collection Vol . 1 . "
524466	4445210	61390	7.0	Different Story & Artwork	This is really different , an animated that you would think has to be really funny with the people that made it , guys like Chuck Jones and Frank Tashin , Paul Frees and Maurice Noble . . . . but it isn't . It simply is a comment on being who you are , and perhaps a dig or two on our industrialized , impersonal society . Whatever the intent , there is one thing for sure : this is different . One could made the same analogy with an alligator and the state of Florida . One day it's a swamp ; the next thing you know it's nothing but concrete and condominiums . Huh ? That's the scene here as the bear hibernates , wakes up and now he's in the middle of a big city and then , inside a factory where nobody believes he's a bear . Why would they ? Why would a bear be in a factor ? What happened to the open land where he lived ? Everyone has questions in here . However one interprets this story , I enjoyed the artwork and the modern style of it in this cartoon . Like the story , the artwork is very different from the Looney Tunes we are used to seeing from the 1930s through the 1950s . In some respects , it is very ' 60-ish looking , a la The Pink Panther cartoons . Whatever it is , if you own the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Three , don't overlook this extra cartoon that is listed under " From The Vault . "
523273	4445210	60736	7.0	Simple Story . . . . . And It Works	Boy , this is about a simple an action story as you're going to find , but it works , and has its interesting moments . Almost the entire film is devoted to a safari guide / hunter being chased ( for the kill ) by members of a angry tribe . Those tribe members had been insulted by an obnoxious member of the safari group and this good-guy guide ( Cornell Wilde ) has to run for his life . Along his escape for survival , we , the viewers , are treated almost to a National Geographic-type tour of the African jungle with many wild animals , crocodiles , poisonous insects , snakes and - the most species of them all : naked women ! The film looks dated here and there but it's now over 40 years old . There is not much English dialog in here , but it's not needed .
523245	4445210	87414	7.0	Good points ; bad points	I just watched this movie for the third time , and for the first time on DVD . I then read the reviews on this website . The reviews all contained good points but I was surprised at two things : 1 ) Very few reviews were from the United States . It appears that Europeans and Australians are far more aware of this film than we are here in America , which is our loss ; 2 ) ( Spoiler ? ) Nobody mentioned or questioned why hit man John Hurt did NOT kill Laura Del Sol . In real life , there would have been no hesitation by the professional killer : she would have been eliminated quickly . . . . . and , of course , the story - had it been real - would have ended quite differently from the film . Outside of that last point , I thought the film contained real characters exhibiting many of their strengths and weaknesses . Unlike most gangster films of the past 35 years , this one had little action and concentrated more on the principal characters . It would be too talky for most young audiences of today . Other highlights : Nice Spanish scenery and flamenco soundtrack . Good opening instrumental by Eric Clapton . Interesting to see Roth in one of his earliest roles , although it's been a familiar one for him : an annoying punk . An ending that wasn't predictable . One disappointment : Why wasn't this DVD presented on widescreen ? Why was this formatted-to-TV ? The transfer isn't bad but with the great scenery , why couldn't we see it all ? There is no excuse for that . Summary : a good , solid film but more for mature adults who don't mind a slower pace and can appreciate a lot of subtle things .
523509	4445210	391150	7.0	Loved The Hopper-Type Drawings	Even a pizza slice with wiggling insects in it is better than food with 0 percent fat in it ! That's the thinking of our " fat cat " in this animated short . The cat discovers his dry food is diet cat food with no fat , and is not happy . He spots a slice a pizza hanging off the kitchen island , and most of the cartoon is the feline's efforts to get that slice of pizza . It's not howling funny but the artwork is beautiful , a sort-of muted Edward Hopper painting look to it , and the story is interesting with a unique and unexpected ending . I saw this on a DVD called " Computer Animation Extravaganza , " done around 2001 .
526277	4445210	260866	7.0	Decent Kidnap Story Worth One Look	Here's another interesting kidnap story . Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience's attention . . . . so the almost - two hours go by pretty quickly . The whole cast , actually , pretty good with no one person standing out . The story loses points because the ending goes on too long and has the standard villain - holds - the - gun - and - doesn't shoot-too long cliché which drives critics , me included crazy . That , and a bit too many f-words in here by the female cop ( Jennifer Esposito ) which simply aren't necessary , and a few other holes all reduce this from a sure 9-star to an " 8 . . . . . but don't misunderstand : it's worth a look .
526184	4445210	335549	7.0	Debbie Reynolds With A Lot Of Back-Stage Details Of This Famous Film	Not surprising , host Debbie Reynolds said everyone connected with this movie thought they were " just making another splashy MGM musical , like so many that were so popular in the 1950s . We had no idea this film would be listed , years later , as one of the greatest films of all time . " This 35-minute feature is part of the two-disc special-edition DVD of " Singin ' In The Rain " which celebrates the 50th anniversary of this famous musical . It starred our host , along with Gene Kelly , Donald O'Connor and Jean Hagen . This has to be Kelly's most famous film . Even those who never watched the movie have , at some time in their life , has seen clips of him dancing to the title number . Many silent screen stars did not survive the " talkie " revolution , the switch to silent to talking films . That transitional period is the primary story of " Singin ' In The Rain . " Debbie gives us the history of musicals at MGM , beginning with the " The Broadway Melody " in 1929 . I was shocked to hear that in the next musical , " The Hollywood Revue Of 1929 , " the key song was " Singin ' In The Rain . " I guess like others I presumed the song was made for this 1952 hit movie . Reynolds , director Stanley Donen , screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green heap praise on Arthur Freed , who produced those first musicals , and more after that including , of course , this film . He also wrote the lyrics to the songs and those were written back in the late ' 20s . It was nice to see Donald O'Connor again , along with Kathleen Freeman , Cyd Charisse and Stanely Donan . O'Connor , however , was only on briefly here . My guess was that he was ill because O'Connor died the following year after this interview . Kelly , who co-directed as well as starring in the film , was a perfectionist and had to have everything , not just the dancing , to be perfect , such as set decorations and having everything look just as it would in the 1920s . Yet , no one resented this because they liked the guy . Like fellow hoofer Fred Astaire , Gene worked his partners hard . Reynolds feet bled at times and Cyrisse would go home black-and-blue . Reynolds covers a lot of ground and , of course , a fair amount is about herself but , that's okay . She was fair to everyone . If you really love this film , you'll enjoy all the details she provides .
524321	4445210	44554	7.0	Spike Is The Undeserved Victim Here	" If one more thing happens to my little dream house , there is going to be murder ! " When he hears threats like that - always delivered to Tom by either Spike the dog or Mammy Two Shoes the maid , it's music to Jerry's ears . . . . . . and the devil sets to work to make sure that DOES happen . His goal is always to see that Tom gets what's coming to him . Spike hasn't built the house yet ; he just has the blueprints , but he's working on it . Unfortunately , every time he's trying the build the house the stupid cat - who is always chasing Jerry - gets in the way , ruins what has been built . . . . . and pays a big price . Spike never bluffs . If he promises something ; he'll deliver ! Actually , Spike shows more patience and tolerance in this episode that you would think . Tom , in the beginning , accidentally demolishes the in-progress dog house but later he acts nasty himself . . . . so you wind up rooting for the dog in this one . Some of the gags in here are good , such as Spike looking like a daisy or a few other odd things . Actually , the poor dog takes the brunt of the violence in this cartoon . In fact , I can't think of another Tom and Jerry where Tom deserved punishment more than this one . I usually root for him , but not here .
526869	4445210	335345	7.0	The Good & Bad Of ' The Passion Of The Christ '	I can't believe I didn't write a review after seeing this , but I must have incorrectly presumed I did . With so many other reviewers by now , I'll make my points as brief as possible . GOOD - Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings , as gruesome and horrible as they were , although , if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible , it was even worse than shown on this film . Jesus ' face was beaten to a pulp and " unrecognizable " so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings . However , the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film ; it's an according-to-the-Book account and after you see this on film , it shakes you up . I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters . I thought that was probably exaggerated , but it wasn't . I felt the same way , just stunned at what I had witnessed . As a Believer , it was something I needed to see to remind me of what this God-in the flesh human voluntarily went through . For non-Believers , scoffers or whatever , I don't know what your reaction was to the film but for me , it was a humbling , sobering experience . THE BAD - The unrelenting brutality against Jesus the last three-quarters of this film is so bad that , frankly , I would hesitate before ever watching this again . One viewing is enough . I am amazed so many people sat through this , including Christians . I wish director / producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering , although I understand Mel's point . However , all of Jesus ' claims and sufferings are meaningless without the resurrection , so why not emphasize that instead of just tacking it on for the last minute or two ? Just asking . It's a cliché , but this is a film you won't soon forget , but I would add to that , one you probably won't want to watch multiple times .
526572	4445210	381074	7.0	You Wouldn't Want To Live Here !	Frankly , I am surprised I hung with this movie because it's pretty slow . It's not a real " entertainer , " except for two things : 1 - the camera-work is nice at times ; 2 - the story is quite different from anything we are accustomed to in the West . But after two-thirds of this story had elapsed , it was tough going the rest of the way . It's not an uplifting story , either . It left me feeling depressed . Yet , it IS a memorable film and I'm glad I watched it . I mean , as one reviewer says here " Vietnamese dude leads a bunch of buffaloes in search of grass . That's it . " Yes , in one sense he's right , but obviously there is more to it than that . We get glimpses of this guy's father and mother , friends , enemies , thieves , sex , loyalty and abandonment and generally what life must be like for those in this story of people who live in this odd environment . With all the water around them , they couldn't bury their loved ones until the dry season came . They wrapped them up and put them on poles , and hopes the crows didn't peck away at the bodies . Yes , you wouldn't want to live here , at the southern tip of Vietnam with these rainy , long flood season . Lugging a couple of Water Buffaloes through waist-deep muddy water for miles can't be a great existence , either . I agree with another critic here who labels this story as " lyrical . " For the most part , I liked watching and listening to " Kim " ( The Lu Le ) give his outlook on various topics and the dialog between he and his father often was humorous . Hey , how many times have you / did you sit around and smoke " weed " and play the flute with your dad ? This is a culture far removed from mine , which is one reason why I stayed with this film - to learn something while witnessing some very foreign sights and sounds to me . I would recommend this only to people who know what they are getting into ( something slow , and very different ) or who just plain love most Asian films .
526645	4445210	105483	7.0	Interesting Look At Hassidic Way Of Life	Here's a very low-key movie that centers around Hassidic Jews and their lifestyles , similar to what " Witness " was with the Amish people . I found it to be interesting look at the Hassidic way of life . The first half of the film is much better than the second half , or this would rated higher . It has two big things going for it : wonderful golden-hued cinematography and not much gratuitous sex and profanity . It's probably too low-key , at least in that second half which needed more suspense and action to be a better-liked and known film . Despite being difficult believing the soft-spoken Melanie Griffith as a tough NYC cop , she still does an excellent job in the lead role and Eric Thai , ditto , as the romantic interest . There are a few disappointments in the last part of the film but the very ending is good and surprised me .
522935	4445210	802009	7.0	England : A Country With A LONG History !	" Little area , big influence , " is the way our host , Justine Shapiro , describes England in the opening of this 52-minute historic tour , which is just half of the DVD . The other half is similar-length tour of just London . Justine's trip begins at Hastings , where the famous battle of old days is reenacted each year , and we see some of that . We also go inside a neat lighthouse , very old penny arcade , and a spectacular Fantasy Pavilion . In going up to London , she advises to try to out-of-way places where you won't get mobbed with tourists . We visit a " pie and mash " eatery in the East End , made famous by Jack The Ripper , for one . The boat rides are a great way to see the countryside around the area . Traveling further north , she takes us on a special double-decker bus complete with showers , beds and whatever . . . . enough for eight people . That's where we go through Yorkshire and the famous Moors , where Emily Bronte was inspired to write , " Wuthering Heights . " Next stop is Whitby , an eerie place where Bram Stoker wrote " Dracula . " Then it's on to a place that might be unfamiliar to a lot of us North Americans : Hadrian's wall built by the Romans in 2 A . D . as a kind of border between the " civilized world " ( England ) and the " barbaric " ( Scotland ) . I'll bet the Scots don't think much of that . The wall stretches for 73 miles . We are then on a steam train . The Brits love them and their looks , and I agree with them . They are beautiful trains . Shapiro takes it to Liverpool where she then takes the " Magical Mystery Tour " to celebrate The Beatles . The final leg is in the West Country and the magnificent Longleat . This is another place where one really feels the history of this country , our host remarks , summing it up with " The past feels present here . " I checked out the next segment - the one covering the city of London - for 40 minutes until the host , a young Australian , Jonathan Atherton , got too offensive and obnoxious , getting drunk " in our church sanctuary and getting crucified , ha , ha , ha ! ! " as he hoists another beer . Imagine insulting another religion like that and putting it on TV and in a DVD , but insulting Christianity and the Cross . . . . well , that's okay . I won't watch anything more hosted by this ignorant moron nor will even report on what he said in here prior to his drunk scene , expect to say about 10 minutes before that , he did meet some fellow Aussies and they all got drunk , too . Nice lot , those mates , eh ? Let's hope they don't represent the average citizen in their country .
523895	4445210	94828	7.0	Nice Face , Nice Sculptures !	There's some nice photography in here , which is what helped me get through this long ( 159 minutes ) soap opera-type story about the girlfriend ( the title name , played by Isabelle Adjani ) of the famous sculptor Rodin ( Gerard Depardieu ) . There are a lot of closeups of Adjani which was fine with me as I never get tired of seeing her looks . " Camille " also was a sculptor but when the romance with Rodin went sour , she went literally crazy . This movie details that saga . In addition to the cinematography , you get to see some great sculptures - really good pieces of work . I just wish they had shown how the artists accomplished these pieces . Since they are just actors , all it did was show the two leads chipping away chunks of clay , never showing any detail work . At least , the film made me appreciate the art form more .
527067	4445210	110678	7.0	Better Than How It First Looks	On the surface , this looks like a dumb movie which is overly violent and too seedy because it features nothing but hardened criminals plus the normal sadistic warden Hollywood always shows in all modern-day films . But . . . . it turns out the story isn't as sordid as it looks and the violence , although plentiful , is somehow not overdone . Also , the chief villain " Walter Marek " ( Stuart Wilson ) is a man with a good sense of humor . The comedic relief he brings is a real plus to the story . By the way , Wilson doesn't look like Mel Gibson but his voice sure sounds similar . " No Escape " is strictly an action movie with an all-male cast that has a grim atmosphere of convicts fighting it out on an inescapable island in the year 2022 . Profanity isn't as much as you'd except in a tough film like this and - in a real oddity - Lance Henriksen is the nicest guy in the movie ! He never utters a bad or angry word . If you know the characters Henriksen usually plays , you know this is a rarity . Ray Liotta , Michael Lerner and Ernie Hudson also star , so it's a decent cast . You could do a lot worse looking for two hours of " escapist " fare .
526371	4445210	110632	7.0	One Of The Wildest , Sickest & Craziest Films You'll Ever See	Yikes , this is a sick movie and one of the wildest I've ever watched . THE GOOD - This is so stylishly-filmed it's unbelievable . The wild camera techniques - quick flashes , sudden changes from color to black-and-white and back , distorted sound bytes , tilted camera angles , wild colors and symbolic images , distorted sound bytes - are all fascinating to watch . Then there's the crazy story , which ranges from really good to really bad . It's good to see the tabloid media mentality mocked for the trash it is , glorifying evil just to get ratings and the evil killers feeding off that media frenzy . Most of the characters in this film , as bad as they are , are definitely attention-getting . The two leads , " Mickey and Mallory " are two names that now go together , thanks to this film and the ultra-sleazy portrayals of them by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis . THE BAD NEWS - Most of the people in this film , if not all , are so vile , so profane , so morally bankrupt , so disgusting you want to take a shower after watching this film . Even the film critics who gravitate toward evil were repulsed by this movie . I actually enjoyed the story up to a point : about the halfway mark . After that , it becomes one gigantic mess , almost too difficult to watch in one sitting . I am mainly referring to all the scenes in the prison including the drawn - out riot / prison break , which goes on way too long . Over 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain - almost all of them in the second half of the movie , didn't help in my rating . Tommy Lee Jones , as the warden , and Robert Downey , as the Aussie scumbag tabloid reporter , absolutely go over-the-top . OVERALL - In order to stomach this film , you have to look at it as some outrageous satire on violence and the media and take these characters as extreme cartoon-like people and nothing else . Take nothing seriously here . It might help to wear earplugs , too , in profanity and just plan noise bother you .
523508	4445210	210203	8.0	Only The Shadow Knows !	Now this is hard to explain , even with a 10-sentence minimum . It's just a very bizarre and unique animated effort , which only runs several minutes but is mesmerizing . In a nutshell , this gangling young man is seen shuffling along a sidewalk . He notices a poster advertising " Hercules " and winds up being a different person than his shadow . The latter begins to have some shapes that don't reflect who he really is and watching this animation unfold is almost like seeing a three-minute Salvador Dali painting come to life in parts . . . . . just strange . This was part of the DVD called " Computer Animation Extravaganza . " Only a couple of the 16 short films are listed here on IMDb and this is one of them . I recommend the DVD to anyone who appreciates nice computer visuals and has an odd sense of humor and wonder . Some of these animated efforts , mostly done by college-age students , are very inventive and fun to view .
525515	4445210	43955	8.0	Nasty Robert Ryan Elevates This Film Noir	A deep cast of well-known actors highlights this film noir effort . Robert Mitchum , Robert Ryan , Lizabeth Scott , William Talman , Ray Collins , Don Porter and William Conrad are all familiar names , especially to film noir buffs . Ryan lifts this from an average classic-era crime film to above-average with a convincingly nasty character . He plays a no-compromise hood who lives by the code of violence . You have a problem ? Violence , not brains , is the answer , according to Ryan's character " Nick Scanlon . " The film is fast-moving despite not having a lot of action scenes . All the characters are good , not just Ryan's , and the dialog is excellent in spots . The photography is nothing special , at least not as dramatic as most noirs , but it's a solid crime film , thanks to this cast . I would rate this a bit higher but I didn't care for the ending .
523256	4445210	451079	8.0	High-Def Really Makes This Come Alive	There is a stunning difference in watching this animated feature on regular DVD and viewing it on Blu-Ray . The latter dramatically elevates my rating of this movie , because the story is just so-so . It's a nice story , but nothing that will leave you laughing like in " Cars , " or " Madagascar " or a bunch of other recently-made animated features . However , on Blu-Ray , this is so flat-out awesome to look at , that's is well worth seeing and adding to your movie collection . The brilliant colors and razor-sharp images are just amazing and totally stunning ! Jim Carrey does a nice job as " Horton . " You might not even recognize his voice . He plays a character who hears a voice nobody else hears ; the voice of a tiny person on top of flower / weed which is part of a tiny town on the top of that plant . Hey , " size matters , " I guess , but far more important is the value of living beings regardless of their size . That's the general message of the story . All lives are worth saving , no matter how supposedly small and allegedly insignificant . The story is the typical frustrating one in which nobody believes the one who is telling the truth , until near the end , and then all of them do the right thing . Overall - a good message , presented in a so-so story but a gorgeous one to watch on Blu-Ray .
526684	4445210	52390	8.0	Two More Original Gadgets From ' Acme '	This wastes no time showing Wile E . Coyote ( famishius vularis ingenious ) chasing The Road Runner ( birdius high-ballius ) . It begins in the opening credits , and only momentarily slows down after 100 seconds when the coyote comes up with this first plan . Wile's idea - lets's catapult myself by throwing a boulder on the other end of this teeter - totter - winds up with our famished friend falling a thousand feet almost into the same imprint he left in the ground minutes earlier . Before he falls a third time - he has a fatalistic approach by now - he puts a trampoline over that same spot . I liked the names of the two Acme products he purchased for this one : the " Giant Rubberband For Tripping Road-Runners " kit and the " One Do-It-Yourself Tornado Kit " along with the gags of him getting out of a dynamite-rigged one nail at a time and the headgear for his ill-fated high-wire act . It's the same old story but with some inventive ideas , new and funny schemes by the pathetic but never-say-die Wile .
525662	4445210	26073	8.0	Stanwyck Good Choice For The Role	Barbara Stanwyck , as I have mentioned in other reviews , was a tough woman but a likable one , at least with me . I don't normally go for those tough dames but her voice and personality she brought to a lot of roles always attracted me . A case in point was this movie . I doubt if another actress would have made this a better-than-average film , which Stanwyck did . Preston Foster's character in here , meanwhile , undergoes one of the fastest transformations I've ever seen on film , from arrogant pig to very likable good guy in no time at all . In fact , he turned out to be such a good guy that parts of this film , where " Toby Walker " was wronged , are difficult to watch . There's a little humor also thrown in this western , mainly involving " Sitting Bull . " It's been a long time since I've seen this film but I would definitely watch it again if it came out on DVD .
526463	4445210	1066646	8.0	Lots Of Info To Start This Series Off	This first segment in this 9-part television series looks at the beginnings of the American Civil War : how the South felt and why it seceded from the Union ; President Abraham Lincoln's election , and the beginning battles of this famous war . This , being the longest episode of the series at 100 minutes , had a lot of facts presented . To those not well-versed on the war ( such as I ) , this was like taking a course in American history . There are so many facts to learn and names to remember - if I want to keep up with this series - it gets taxing on one's brain . However , the program is presented in such a format that it is usually interesting . Filmmaker Ken Burns went on to use this format in his other projects , such as the series on baseball . He shows a lot of black-and-white pictures of the era , throws in some modern day color shots ( which are beautiful ) and adds narration to everything . The latter is in the form of letters written by witnesses of the war , or in biographies or in comments by modern-day historians . The voices are provided by a host of people , from history writers and commentators to Hollywood actors . Those quoted most often in this opening show are two of the most eloquent men in U . S . history : Lincoln and Frederick Douglass , the black leader of his day . Also , at the end of this segment , we hear quite a bit about George McClellan , a man who got the Union armies in shape to fight . Overall , there were too many bits of information to recall them all here .
523126	4445210	245562	8.0	Another Decent Modern-Day WWII Movie	It's nice to see World War II films making a comeback , as they have seemed to do since the arrival of " Saving Private Ryan " in 1997 . This is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to experience some very realistic action scenes . The main thing is that the story is interesting . With a John Woo-directed film , you know are going to get tons of action , almost always too much , and that's the case here . However , some of the scenes are fantastic . You also get some beautiful cinematography . Still on the positive , the acting was good in here with Nicholas Cage in the lead role and a lesser-name-but-good supporting cast . The story , although fairly long at 134 minutes , was never boring . On the negative side , as mentioned , Woo tends to overkill and this movie must have a set record for number of people killed . It also leans on the politically correct side , of course , with Native American spirituality given complete reverence as usual and the Catholic ( Cage ) looking like a very weak in his beliefs . In modern-days , you'll never see the opposite shown on film . Anyway , it's a good action movie that certainly entertains . The intense and long action makes it almost too much to watch in one viewing !
523569	4445210	36348	8.0	Nice Camera-work In Here	This is a very entertaining Sherlock Holmes film with some of the best - maybe THE best - camera-work I've seen in the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce series . The photography was better than the story , which was disappointing only in that it was too easy to spot the killer . Heck , even I found it no problem , so it must have been too easy . The characters were interesting and all quite different . Some were mental patients who had suffered from World War II . Miburn Stone played the lone American and I didn't recognize the man who went on to play " Doc " in the long - running hit TV series " Gunsmoke . " However , his voice sounded familiar .
525501	4445210	1024352	8.0	A Lot Of ' Macs " For Your Money Here	Boy , there are really dragging out this deal with our star " Mac " ( Gary Sinise ) going through all this interrogation and court hearings , etc . , over the serial killer scumbag who jumped from the roof killing himself in last week's finale . For political gain and other reasons , the higher-ups - " Stanton " and " Sinclair " and a police advocate ( laywer ) who is some incredibly-smug woman - are all made to look nasty and self-serving as they try to ruin the reputation of " Mac . " The writers on this show ( and most others ) are so manipulative I almost laugh out loud sometimes . They make it so you just hate these people with a passion ! Subtly has never been a strong point with TV-and-film makers . Meanwhile , the sleaze factor is back as a man is impaled on a condom machine in the men's room somewhere at his bride-to-be's female party . He crashes the party , gets upset when he sees his finance being cuddled by - get this - ex-tennis great John McEnroe and storms into the restroom . Witnesses say McEnroe followed him there , and the next thing they new the man was found dead in that unusual spot . On top of that ludicrous and bloody sight , we get a bunch of wise-guy jokes ( " Dead Man Standing , " " safe sex , " etc . ) . The writers have every CSI member except Lindsay making professional jokes at every crime scene now . Although never a fan of McEnroe the tennis star ( or short-lived TV talk show host ) , I have to give him his due : he performs well in here and is funny . The guy appears to be a good actor . What the angle was involving him in this story was something I figured out early on . If an idiot like me can guess what is really happening , you can , too . Meanwhile , on a more positive note , " Don Flack " now seems to be sticking up for his boss instead of the other way around , so that's good to see . I would hate to lose him from the show even though he isn't a major character . Eddie Cahill does a nice job with that role .
525479	4445210	121771	8.0	This ' Whopper ' Is Out Of This World !	One thing I can say about these " Willie Whopper " cartoons : they are never boring . They are as wild as Willie's imagination , filled with tons of sight gags , so many that there usually isn't much a story , just continuing craziness . This episode is a prime example of that and is the only I've seen so far that might have been a dream instead of Willie telling another " whopper . " Whatever , it's pretty insane as our boy winds up on some goofy planet . He got there after the helium gas his dentist gave him blew him up the size of an hot-air balloon and he floated up and out of the dentist's office right through the roof of the building ! That kind of gives you idea of how loony this story is going to be , and it really gets nuts as Willie winds up on a planet with bizarre characters . Suffice to say if you seeing one nutty cartoon-like visual joke after another for seven or eight minutes , you'll enjoy this .
525961	4445210	289765	8.0	Good Re-Make Of ' Lecter Film '	This is a very good " remake " of Manhunter " which was the first Hannibal Lecter movie but didn't get the press the others did because it didn't have Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal . After " Silence of the Lambs " became so popular , and the sequel , " Hannibal , " it was decided to re-do that first film and this time obtain Hopkins ' services . It worked because not only do you have the incomparable Hopkins at Dr . Lecter but you have one this generations best actors , Edward Norton , as the leading character " Will Graham . " Norton , as always , gives a solid performance . And - look at the backup cast : Ralph Fiennes , Emily Watson , Harvey Keitel , Mary Louise Parker and Philip Seymour Hoffman . Not bad . This is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing . On my first look , I was disappointed Hopkins didn't have a bigger role but , after I knew what to expect , subsequent viewings made me appreciate the film's effort as a whole , and it's an underrated flick and a fine addition to the " Lecter " series .
525217	4445210	94226	8.0	Good Movie , But I Still Prefer Stack Over Costner As ' Elliot Ness '	I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger , but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story . Costner is a good enough actor to make me believe he's anyone after awhile . However , after years of growing up watching Robert Stack playing " Elliot Ness " on TV on the hit series , " The Untouchables , " it took me a bit to accept Costner in that role . That part will always belong to Mr . Stack . At first , he just did not speak with the authority of a tough Chicago cop out to get Al Capone and the racketeers from the Prohibition Age in Chicago . His partner , " Oscar Wallace , " played by the little nerdy-looking Charles Martin Smith as a gun-toting T-Man , is even harder to believe . Of the " good guys , " Andy Garcia is the only likeble and believable guy . Sean Connery has the best character in the film ( " Jim Malone " ) and is the most interesting to watch . Nonetheless , it's a good story with good characters and just about he right amount of action . It moves very well , which tells me the movie is entertaining . There are a few memorable scenes , such as the shootout at the train station with the baby carriage descending the stairway and a memorable scene with Robert De Niro as Capone . This is a tough , very violent and bloody movie . . . . . nothing like the old TV show .
524401	4445210	156812	8.0	Some Good ' Ole Southern Charm	Here's a bit of an unusual film : a modern-day movie made more for adults than kids but could be equally enjoyed by both . There are 9 " damns " and a few other profanities , but nothing earth-shaking . It's simply the memoirs of Willie Morris , a southern boy who wound up as a famous writer and editor of Harper's Magazine . Being that magazine is pretty Liberal , you get Liberal slants in the movie ( racial and anti-war sentiments ) but nothing heavy-handed . As a good story does , it makes you care about the characters , especially the lead one . In here it's " Willie " and his dog " Skip . " Early shots of Skip growing up - measured in how he related to the toilet bowl - are funny . You also care about his parents and are glad when the dad ( Kevin Bacon ) softens his stance on things . As a guy , I appreciated just looking at Diane Lane . What a gorgeous face ! The cinematography is pure southern charm and looks great on DVD . It's not all sweetness . There are some angry moments and some sad ones , to be sure . In summary , however , a nice film . . . . . pure and simple .
526877	4445210	52149	8.0	Familiar Storyline But With A Few New Wrinkles	Although this story takes place back in the old days of France , the storyline is one that was used many times in modern settings in Tom and Jerry cartoons : a threat by an adult to Tom to do something about " the mouse " or it was curtains for the cat . Usually , it meant being tossed out of the house but here , it's the threat of the guillotine if Tom doesn't make sure the " mouseketeers " don't keep quiet so the house-owner can go back to sleep . Whenever Jerry hears threats like that directed toward Tom , he does his best to make sure he gets the cat in trouble by doing what Tom's not supposed to do ( and one wonders why I and others root for Tom in these cartoons ! ) . Jerry has his little gray French mouse friend " Tuffy " with him so the two of them try to make as much noise as possible . We see some repeat sight gags such as Tom balancing a half dozen dishes on his paws to keep dishes from breaking , etc . Even though some of the cartoon is also a direct rehash from others as the early gags are very similar , there were enough original gags - and good ones - to still make this fun to watch . Tom provides the humor as he has to be on his toes , literally . The artwork in here is excellent and CinemaScope a good format to show it off . The colors are brilliant . One scene has the magnificent castle on the left and rolling purple hills in the background of lush yellow / green grass and wheat in the center and right . It's just beautiful .
526974	4445210	44313	8.0	' Great Horny Toadies ! '	This is one of those Bugs Bunny versus Yosemite Sam cartoons except Sam , in this story , is called " Chilacott Sam . " However , it's the same loud-and-obnoxious two-gun sawed-off , red-haired and greedy " varmint . " In this cartoon , he's a " claim jumper , " a guy trying to steal other's gold discoveries up in Alaska . By the way , there is some beautiful artwork in here with all the mountain scenery . When he finds out Bugs has a green thumb-type magic touch for finding gold , Sam follows him and offers to be his partner . " All you have to do , " says Sam , " is find all the gold and I'll share it with you 50-50 . " " Honest and for true ? " responds Bug sarcastically while giving us - the audience - a look . " Well , what are we waiting for ? There's gold in them thar hills . " One of Bugs Bunny's favorite things had to be making an idiot of those who think they are putting something over on him . He likes to play dumb and then totally ruin the person . He's very sadistic at times and very funny ! I loved some of Sam's exclamations in here , such as the one you see in the subject head here . It was just one of many Sam used in this cartoon .
527295	4445210	51756	8.0	' Well , The Least You Can Do Is Get Me Liquored Up '	With a title this corny , I was expecting a lot of laughs , a fun B-movie with Ed Wood-style film-making . Well , I got them , but that mostly in the beginning . The bulk of the film is quite serious and holds up pretty well , even today . The best lines , in the opening segments , come from " Marge " ( Gloria Talbott ) , the one I quoted for the subject head . She said that on her wedding night at the restaurant , since her new husband seemed to be ignoring her . You see , her hubby had already been taken over by an extra-terrestrial being the night before . He just wasn't himself after that . . . . . but who knew ? Unfortunately , nobody for quite awhile in this story , which made life rough for poor " Marge Ferrell . " The lines in this film weren't just corny . Some of them were downright funny . At the guy's bachelor party , which began the show , the men had some humorous lines about marriage and freedom , and later in the show there are a couple of funny scenes . Later one of Marge friends acts goofy and remarks , " I just love to rehearse for weddings , especially when they are my own ! " However , the story begins to get serious after the first 10-15 minutes and gets more and more so after Marge follows her husband one night and sees her odd-acting husband is not the man she thought she married . Laser beams and a spaceship will do that to you ! From that point , it becomes a very familiar story for fans of sci-fi : something we've seen in a lot of films the past 50 years - aliens transform into humans and one that hasn't gets burned by family and friends she trusts because she doesn't realize they , too , have also turned into aliens . In other words , this has a lot of " Invasion Of The Body Snatchers " type of paranoia story , just without the pods . " Invasion " was released two years earlier than this in 1956 . Hollywood , lacking imaginative writers the past few decades , continues to make films with the same storyline as you see here . , but this one can be excused because it was still fairly early in the genre . Thanks to the actors here , and a few different twists , the movie keeps your attention . The only frustration is to see a person telling the truth and not being believed . Talbott , to me , was a familiar face because she acted in many television shows in the 1960s while Tyron , who got some hype for starring in " The Cardinal , " a big-name film that bombed at the box office , wound up being a better writer than an actor . But when it comes to ' 50s sci-fi films , great acting isn't a requirement anyway , and most of us don't watch it for that . Overall , this is pretty good , nothing super but certainly worth a look now that there is a good DVD transfer of it available . Yes , it is far better than the stupid title but still : don't take it too seriously - just have fun with it . Note : the police captain was played by John Eldredge , a regular guest on " The Adventures Of Superman , " in which he almost always played a villain . Also ex-boxer Maxie Rosenbloom is his normal entertaining self in here , playing , as usual , a bartender .
522864	4445210	737840	9.0	Best Episode Yet , Thanks To Bendix	William Bendix , before he became well-known as the lovable " Chester A . Riley " of TV's " The Life Of Riley , " was an actor who played a lot of brutal gangsters in movies . He once punched Alan Ladd in a movie and knocked him out cold . ( Bendix , apparently , wasn't acting ! ) . Anyway , he's back in this late ' 50s crime show playing another tough " animal , " was Walter Winchell describes him in the introduction . Bendix plays " Wally Legenza , " a savage killer and leader of " The Tri-State Gang , " which hijacked a lot of trucks . This episode features a number of " name " actors in addition to Bendix : Alan Hale , Jay Adler and Gavin MacLeod , to name three . Florence Halop may not be a " name " but she's face you've seen many times if you are over watcher of classic TV shows . Nonethess , Bendix makes this best show thus far in Season One . He has a lot of the wisecracks like I loved hearing so much in " The Blue Dahlia , " a film noir of the ' 40s . Here , as " Wally Legenza . " Bendix just made me laugh out loud a number of times with his brutal tough-guy dialog . Great stuff and great photography , once again , too . This looks as good as any noir . This episode makes the purchase of this half-season on DVD worthwhile .
523716	4445210	910613	9.0	You Know You Are In For An Intense Episode When ' Clavo Cruz ' Shows Up	Two cops are bringing a truckload of confiscated weapons to be destroyed when they are rudely interrupted on the street as a semi-trailer suddenly impedes their progress . As the cops screech to a halt , something explodes beneath them and overturns their van . Now all the rifles are dumped out in the street and worse things happen . One cop is dead from the accident and another struggles with some guy and is shot and killed . All of this was planned as we discover early on in the show . A real baddie from past CSI-Miami shows , a name I hadn't heard in awhile , pops up here : " Clavo Cruz " ( Gonzalo Menendez ) . Eric fills in Natalia about that scumbag's history with Horatio and the department . About halfway through this episode , we get another story when a young , Hispanic teen boy is shot and killed , presumably from the one of the guns taken from the heist earlier . The second half of this gets really intense , which is no surprise considering Cruz - perhaps the most vile villain in the history of this program - is involved . The story winds up being a two-parter as one of the CSI regulars is shot twice , the second bullet entering his brain . It's Eric Delki .
524425	4445210	1136137	9.0	Fighting At The Rink , Not On It - Another Indictment Of Youth Sports Parents	This must have been a tough case for the jurors ; at least I found it so . I couldn't make a decision just on what this program offered , I know that . City Confidential almost always takes sides . The more you watch this interesting program , the more you see their bias generally and on individual cases . However , I thought they were more than fair in this instance , giving both sides equal time . It was a tough case involving two overzealous youth hockey parents . There was little premeditation , if any . These two guys didn't know each other . It was a fight in the corridors of the hockey arena and one guy killed another with one of his punches . That's all it was . . . . but did the man go too far ? Frankly , I'm not sure because the man who threw the punch that began the fisticuffs is the one who died . Yet , the two men had fought five minutes earlier , finished it , and the " victor " came back inside . Was he looking to continue the fight , or did he go back inside to check on his kid . You get both versions . Whatever , it was another indictment of what people used to call " Little League parents , " meaning parents who take their kids ' sporting events way too seriously . As pointed out in this program , that is a problem in hockey because the parents invest more money , for one thing , than in any other sport . Ice time is expensive and valuable and some of these parents and kids are at the rink in the middle of the night ! New England is one of the hotbeds of youth hockey in America . In the short profile of Reading , we learn that hockey fever there began in the 1970s when Bobby Orr and " the Big , Bad Bruins " brought a lot of attention to the Boston area . Perhaps the most interesting segment of this episode was the history of Michael Castin , the man who was beaten to death . He had a roller-coaster history of good and bad . Castin had a big alcoholic problem in high school , then went stone sober for eight years and got married , then went off the wagon and wound up in jail and divorced , finally to return as a " Mr . Mom , " spending all his time with his kids and being a devoted father . His mother is interesting here as she discusses her son , his problems , his good points and what happened to him . Of course , she's biased but she was very honest , too . The other key figure in this case was Thomas Junta , a parent who happened to come by and thought the play on the ice was way too rough for just a pickup game . . . . and wound up inadvertently killing the coach . In this program , his brother sticks up for him . It's a bizarre case but one that got huge media attention and , hopefully , toned down some of action on the part of spectators at youth events . However , every year we hear about some parents , whatever the sport , getting violently out of control .
526916	4445210	1126561	9.0	Story Starts Off With A Bang , But Ends On A Sad Note	This starts off as a very bizarre story but ends with a tragic tale that devastates one of the CSI regulars , " Danny Messer . " ( Carmine Giovinazzo ) . Some obnoxious guy at the bar lights up an expensive cigar . It blows up in his face . This isn't some novelty-store item ; this stogie was constructed for a big , destructive bang , and half the man's face is blown off . Who did it , and why ? The investigation leads to " Laughing Larry " and other assorted strange characters . This story , despite the gruesomeness of seeing the lower half of a man's face blown off , is very interesting and has some comical moments , too . The second story is anything but comical . It begins with a small neighborhood boy , someone who lives a few doors down from Danny , knocks on his door and reminds him they have to go to church for the annual " blessing of the bikes . " The kid has a new bike and wants the local parish priest to bless it . That happens , and while Danny and the kid are heading home , Danny is diverted by a shot and yells for help . He tells the boy to race home and he'll catch up with him later . Another shot is fired and the boy is killed in front of a store . It turns out to be total accident ; the boy in the wrong place and the wrong time . After the investigation , Danny has to go home and tell the mother her boy has been killed . It ends on that dramatic note .

To cap things off , when she gets off the bus , the inconsiderate idiot in a car races by and splashes mud all over her . Betty is still fuming at work . Apparently she works in a court room because while tiding up at the judge's desk , she dons the robe and fantasizes about taking care of these " pests . " She has been muttering about " all these pests in town and I wish I was a judge and could do something about them . " Well , we then see her fantasy and what she'd like to see happen to these obnoxious , rude people . It's pretty wild , and so is the ending . It's another solid Betty Boop cartoon , meaning fun to watch .
523960	4445210	342258	9.0	A Brutal-Yet-Touching Film	For a martial arts picture , " Unleashed " was above average because it had some heart and soul to it . . . . . not just people beating the crap out of one another for two straight hours . However , be wary of those who claim this isn't an action film . That's not true : there is a lot of action , quite a bit of brutality and profanity , mostly by Bob Hoskins ' character " Bart " in this movie . Hoskins plays profane , nasty slave-owner who has locked up and trained " Danny " ( Jet Li ) to be the ultimate fighting machine . Once Danny is " unleashed " ( literally ) he's a killer and helps the gangster Bart in his criminal work . Then , in a moment of further greed , Hoskins agrees to enter his man in a death match with a lot of money at stake . That match turns out to be a farce with Danny winning in a matter of seconds . The other promoter wants a rematch , and with more entertainment . In the meantime , however , Danny escapes his captors and winds up at the house of an older blind American , " Sam , " played by Morgan Freeman . He and his 18-year-old daughter " Natalie " ( Kelly Condon ) befriend young Danny , slowly bringing him out of his " animal " state . Everyone discovers Danny has some very human characteristics and is basically a nice , gentle guy . The family helps uncover that through music ( piano playing , to be exact ) . These are all touching scenes . But then - and this is almost a cliché in these kind of films - the bad guy comes back , snatches him away and his former bad life comes back . . . . except Danny is a changed man . How he can get out of this latest predicament and what happens to this new " adopted " family , takes up the rest of the story . That last part has the same thing : ultra-violent and touching scenes . Jet Li does an excellent job in here , not only displaying his amazing physical talents but also showing us he has warmth in his face and heart . Overall : a brutal , yet touching film : an odd combination .
527088	4445210	53083	9.0	One Of The Most Unique Cartoons Ever	Wow , this was a shock - the real voices of Jack Benny and his TV stars : " Jack , " " Rochester , " " Mary " and " Don . " Mel Blanc voices " The Maxwell . " Anyway , it's strange to hear the real Jack Benny voice himself in this cartoon as we see him playing his violin early on and comparing himself ( favorably ) to the great violinist Isaac Stern . The jokes are typical Benny lines , except he's a mouse here so counts his cheese instead of his dollar bills . The extent to which he locks up the cheese is extremely funny . In this cartoon , we get all the regular Benny jokes and blank stares ! This is almost like watching the real Jack Benny Show . The ending of this cartoon makes this a unique Looney Tunes one - a real treasure for Benny fans . ( A hint : we see the actual Jack Benny ! )
522391	4445210	25688	9.0	' Pop " Goes Curly !	This very early Three Stooges effort starts off differently than almost all their others in that the three don't know each other . Moe is a fight manager looking for boxer ; Curly is a waiter and Larry a violinist . They all meet at this restaurant and when Larry starts playing " Pop Goes The Weasel , " Curly goes nuts and punches everyone's lights out . Moe hires the two so he can get back into the fight game . One day during some roadside training , they meet up with a pretty dame whose car is stuck in the mud . By playing the " Weasel " song , Curly lifts the car and solves the problem . She drives off as he jumps in the back seat ! The next scenes show newspaper headlines as " K . O . Stradivarius " ( our hero Curly ) beats all opponents and is now scheduled to fight for the championship . The last bout is something to see : probably the goofiest fight scenes I've ever seen on film , which includes the great silent comics . Larry Howard ( " Curly " ) was an underrated comic genius and shows it here early on in his career . It's the subtle things he does in this fight that had me laughing out loud .
527125	4445210	78346	9.0	Superman Takes Off On The Big Screen	It's interesting that another re-make is coming out this year . Man , time flies because I vividly remember when this movie came out and the excitement it caused . This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects , so it was pretty cool , to say the least . It's still very entertaining , and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain ( Gene Hackman as " Lex Luthor " ) and the lines he delivers . He's a funny guy . Christopher Reeve , meanwhile , was always a popular " Man Of Steel " and the special effects are still fun to watch , from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits . There's a solid soundtrack to this , too . Personally , I didn't care for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again , Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying , too . I guess it comes with her character . However , being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence ( it's now on DVD , by the way , and worth a purchase ) , it was just too weird hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were ! Anyway , this is simply great entertainment . As a superhero , Superman has always been THE MAN . Three sequels followed this film , the second one being the best in my opinion .
525939	4445210	148288	9.0	Dylan Shocks The Folkies While Jimi & Pete Smash Guitars	Half of this hour-long episode is a tribute to poet-singer Bob Dylan and the other half is the continuation of the history of rock ' n roll , as the DVD title suggests . To this day , I still think Dylan is one of the worst singers I've ever heard but there is no denying his songwriting and his influence on music which is why , obviously , he got so much air time on this series . So far , nobody has gotten that much publicity on this Time-Life series , even Elvis or The Beatles , which doesn't make sense . Whatever , Dylan wrote a lot of great songs and is spoken of in God-like terms by other musicians interviewed here . Since Dylan started out as a folk singer , that genre gets a segment here on this fifth episode . Since it's not rock ' n roll and , it's admitted here by someone that " folkies " hated rock music , then why is it included in this series ? My guess is that folk music was so " socially aware , " so Left Wing , the editors here just had to give it huge notice and praise . We listen to some songs and hear comments by " bohemians from coffee houses " who hit it big in the ' 60s such as Joan Baez , Judy Collins , Dave Van Ronk , Phil Ochs , Richie Havens , Arlo Guthrie and Peter , Paul and Mary . The 1965 Newport Folk Festival , however , changed things bigtime , as we see . Dylan shocked people with electric material , literally , which is why this episode is called " plugged in . " Give Dylan credit ; he had guts . He teed off all the " folkies . " Where was his " integrity ? " they asked . Gee , what elitist snobs . Where is their tolerance ? Good for Bob . The second half of this hour-long show features , among others , Roger McGuinn and The Byrds , John and Michelle Phillips and The Mamas and the Papas ; Brian Wilson did not want to tour with the famous Beach Boys , wanted to make better music - " Pet Sounds " spiritual and sophisticated - and that was big breakthrough " Underground radio " begins and the first big star was Jimi Hendrix , who went to England , blew the other musicians ' minds , and came back to do the same here in the States . He is now of legendary status . What a shame he died early . Later , we hear from Pete Townsend , Peter No one ( " Herman's Hermits " ) , Eric Clapton and a few others as rock goes electric in a big-way and blues is introduced to white kids . The Monterey Pop Festival of 1967 is the first time Hendrix and others played for American audience . " That concert was the real ground-breaker for rock ' n roll , " remarks Al Kooper . Hendrix and The Who exhibited , as we see , a new theater , smashing up their guitars after their sets . The Who demolished about everything The rock ' n roll scene was really heating up !
523501	4445210	443680	9.0	So Many Things You Can Say About This Film !	Do you notice how long many of the reviews are in here about this movie ? That's because there is so much one could say . This is an unusual movie , especially for a modern-day-filmed western . Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the " stars " of this movie but the biggest star to me was Roger Deakins , the man who photographed this film . Wow , this is beautiful ! It's so stunning to look at in so many spots that there were many times I was more involved in the visuals than the story . In that sense , it reminded me of the marvelously-photographed films of Terrence Malick . Kudos to Andrew Dominik for a similar style directorial performance here . Regarding the story , here's a warning to those who are expecting the normal western fare and want to see the usual amount of gun battles and related action scenes . This film is 2 hour and 40 minutes and there are not many " action " scenes . If you are hoping to see another " 3 : 10 To Yuma " re-make , you will be very disappointed . This story is slow . It's a character study of Jesse James and the man who killed him , Robert Ford . That said , I still found it a memorable film . The photography , the great acting and the uniqueness of the story were all good enough to keep me interested throughout . For once , I was glad to see James portrayed more realistically . Despite what you've seen on film in the past , this man was not a hero , folks . Sure he was a likable guy at times , and a nice father at times , too , but he was a thief and , much worse , a cold-blooded killer . You see that in this film . I have to say I can't remember a film I've seen in recent years in which the two lead characters ( James and R . Ford ) were so strange and unpredictable . For that , I have to really compliment the work of Pitt and Affleck . They were amazing and kept me guessing throughout the movie . They played very complex people . Another facet that I found unusual were the numerous scenes in which a person's eyes told the story better than any dialog could . The tension in this drama was almost unbearable in many instances . Except for " Once Upon A Time In The West , " I can't recall a film with so many tense scenes with long pauses depicting shots of people's eyes relaying their either their fears or suspicions . Pitt , as " Jesse James , " does a fantastic job in this department . He made us go inside his James ' brain , assuming we were knowing what he's thinking about Robert Ford , and wondering what he would say or do next . James is shown in this film to be a twisted and ( justifiably ) paranoid criminal who doesn't trust anyone . For example , he's constantly moving his family . On the other side of the coin , you have the Ford brothers and other members of James ' gang who are constantly terrified of their boss , knowing he could snap and shoot them any minute . The terrified looks in their eyes were , to me , frightening to watch . This movie is filled with scenes depicting jittery people . Affleck , as " Robert Ford , " the man with the nervous smile , and stuttering-like speech , was one of the strangest characters I've seen on film . Sam Rockwell , as Ford's brother , " Charley , " has a big role in this movie , too , and doesn't really get the billing he should . I thought he was right up there with Pitt and Affleck . I might be in the minority with this opinion , but I found the best part of the film to be the last 20 minutes , depicting how America reacted to the killing of Jesse James and what happened to the Ford brothers . All that was fascinating to me . Overall , once I realized this wasn't a " shoot-em-up " western , and just sat back and appreciated the storytelling , wonderful visuals , low-key narration , fabulous sets , scenery and acting . . . . I ended up being very impressed . So , a key is to know what to expect before you see this film .
522735	4445210	94510	9.0	A Unique TV Show - Would Love To See It Again	Here's a television program I haven't watched since it went off the air over 15 years ago , and I'd give anything to see it again on a DVD package . Gary Cole , as " Jack Killion , " was THE coolest guy on TV at that time , and I mean the kind of " cool " associated with Craig Stevens of TV's " Peter Gunn , " or Steve McQueen in the 1950s and ' 60s movies . Cole a . k . a . " The Nighthawk " in here was just cool . . . . what else can you say ? Jack was a combination late-night radio talk show host and an ex-cop . If I recall , he was off the force after a tragedy cost the life of his partner and the event was still haunting him . He would hear a bunch of troubled people on the radio , some needing assistance quickly or they would be a crime victim . Jack would help them out . The atmosphere was very moody , the music was good and the whole thing was just different , very different from most " crime shows . " Until I looked at the title page I couldn't remember anyone else on the show but I've never forgotten this program . I can only hope I see it again some time .
522738	4445210	1143262	9.0	How They Let This ' Low-Life ' Go Is Mind-Boggling	This is the worst verdict I've seen yet , in the 30-or-so episodes I've watched of this program . It makes me totally lose faith in the jury system . You wonder : " what are these people thinking ? " ere , a man with 16 charges against him including eyewitnesses who saw him shoot and kill a man , and then drive off in a stolen police car . . . . . got off , on all counts ! Unbelievably , Daniel Martinez , beat the rap , thanks to a high-profiled and slick lawyer who obviously fooled a stupid jury . Martinez , everyone agreed , was the town " low-life , " a guy with a rap sheet " longer than the Rio Grande , " as narrator Paul Winfield puts it . Martinez wound up playing both sides of the fence : a full-time criminal and a snitch for the police . The combination didn't work out , and a " Good Samaritan , " wound up losing his life because of it . The details of the story I'll leave for you to discover by watching this episode . I didn't understand another thing : why the victim in the case just simply didn't call the police instead of slipping out of his house in the middle of the night to investigate a woman's screams and other suspicious noises . Well , his heart was in the right place . The history of this criminal , the Sante Fe police department , which didn't come off looking good , either , and a fascinating look at " The City Different , " comprise this hour-long show . Sante Fe , one of the art capitals of the U . S . , looks fascinating but it's not just one long art festival . It has crime , just like everywhere and by the early ' 90s , the rapes and murders came were highlighted by this bizarre case . Oddly , justice did prevail a year later . . . . but not concerning this case .
526540	4445210	71230	9.0	The Film That Made Brooks A Star	Mel Brooks made several very popular and memorable films in the ' 70s but I doubt any was more popular than this one . Made just several years after the morals ' code had been lifted in Hollywood , it was able to provide humor in a new and shocking way . People could fart , swear , have old ladies use the n - word , men could punch horses in the face , make fun of any religion , creed , race or whatever was there to make fun of . . . in other words , no holds barred when it came to trying to get a laugh . Nothing was sacred at this time in Hollywood history and few capitalized on this as well as Brooks , especially with this film . The film doesn't have much shock value anymore but it's still fun to watch and probably always will be , thanks to the outrageous characterizations in here . On the negative side , especially if don't know Brooks does whatever he can to get a laugh and isn't all that political , this film might be too politically-correct with its reverse racism , bias against religion and overly crude situations . But - a big but - there are so many funny lines in here , so many funny scenes you never forget and never fail to laugh no matter how many times you see it ( the campfire scene alone has made men cry in laughter for 30 years ) that you can overlook about anything in here . In summary , a true " classic " guaranteed to entertain for many more years to come .
522951	4445210	10146	9.0	Lots Of Good Stuff In This Harold Lloyd Silent Short	This Harold Lloyd silent film is fun because it has fast-moving story , plenty of chase scenes and sight gags , good camera-work and some great expressions on the actors ' faces . It also has a couple of endearing people such as a poor little girl and her lame dog , and a good-hearted woman . Of course , being a " silent , " I expect exaggerated facial expressions , but some in here are ones that made me laugh out loud . You see all kinds , from shady winks to eyebrow raising to evil-looking smiles . Hey , it's a story about a crooked lawyer and a bunch of thugs ( almost the same ) . One of the lawyers is named " Leech . " The little girl , called " The Waif , " is played by cute Peggy Courtwright . " Waif " is a common term in these silent films , which Charlie Chaplin and others featured a lot : homeless , extremely poor creatures , male , female , children and dogs . " The Girl " as she is called , is played by Mildred Davis . It was her first appearance in a Lloyd film . Four years later , she and Harold were married . Another interesting feature in this film was the sudden switch to a blue tint in the second half . It would be shown for a couple of short scenes . The ending , of course , was the best . You will have a smile on your face at the very last scene in the diner . These wild endings are the norm for silent comedies and are great fun to watch . . I loved how Harold rounded up the cops .
522705	4445210	389860	9.0	Funny & Touching - A Good Combination	This was a funny and - near the end - a touching movie . That's a nice combination to have . My only complaint is that it certainly isn't " family fare " for a nice story and should have been rated " R , " not PG-13 . There's simply too much sexual material ( and and f-word ) for PG-13 . With some editing , this could have been a great story for everyone . However , for us adults who like to laugh , there is plenty in here to do that . The jokes come pretty fast , right from the get-go . The premise would good : with a ( television-like ) remote control , you could control your life . You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life , or freeze frame something that is happening now , or you could go back into time with your life . It all sounds good , but as our main character " Michael Newman " ( Adam Sandler ) found out , it's not so cool . That's a key message here , too , that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us . The major message , however , was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them , as far as priorities go . That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy . As funny as this film is , you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film . Sandler plays a typical role for him , and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs . Kate Bekinsale , who plays his wife " Donna , " looks absolutely beautiful , the prettiest I've seen her since " Pearl Harbor . " She plays a nice lady in here , too . Their little kids - especially the girl ( Tatum McCann ) - are cute and funny at times . I won't mention the dog . I can't without being crude . Christopher Walken is here , and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun-and-interesting characters . Unfortunately - just a warning - this comedy , as so many modern-day ones are , has its share of crude moments , some language and the above-mentioned sexual material . Overall , it was extremely , entertaining , however .
527426	4445210	120917	9.0	High Praise For This ' Kids ' Film	You've often heard the sales pitch , " adults will love it , too ! " almost always referring to a kids ' movie and in particularly , an animated movie for children . Well , in this case I agree . Even as a middle-aged adult , I enjoyed this . The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos , no profanity or even a hint of it . Yet , it's hip with some very clever lines . The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists . David Spade does a fabulous job narrating , has a very pleasing voice , one that's fun to hear . I actually do think adults would like this more than children .
524701	4445210	1188230	9.0	Young Boys Witness Brutal Slaying Of Their Mom	This was an interesting look at the big city of Atltana , " which is about as southern as a can of Boston baked beans , " according to narrator Paul Winfield . His point was , as most people know , Atltanta has a lot of northern people living it in . Northern money rebuilt the city after Gen . Sherman burned it down in 1864 during the Civil War . . . . and Atlanta hasn't stopped growing since . We get some astonishing skyscraper views in this " City Confidential " episode , along with a few shots of the major road systems and horrendous traffic that residents have to endure daily . You really get the feel of a big northern city . We learn about the businesses , leading off with Coca-Cola , who built up the area and provided tons of jobs for those Yankees who invaded the area . We also learn about where the Atlanta folks moved who wanted to raise families in the safest areas : they moved north of the city . One such couple were the Tokars who were single people from the Buffalo , New York , area who moved to Atlanta . Sara Ambrusko was a beautiful girl , the daughter of a prominent physician in a Buffalo suburb . One day on Atlanta TV , she spotted an old high school friend , Fredric Tokars , on the screen and called him up . She was homesick and wanted to talk to someone from her home town . Three months later , they were married . How many times have you wound up seeing that being a mistake : dating for that short a period and getting married ? In this case , it turned out to be a fatal mistake . Fredric Tokars didn't wind up being the handsome , dashing lawyer he looked like on TV . Oh , he was successful ; first as an assistant district attorney and then as his own boss as a criminal defense attorney . The problem was he began to be in cahoots with some of his shady clients . It turns out Sara was very happy being a stay-at-home mom and loved raising her two little boys in a high-class neighborhood in Marietta . He was a immoral kind of husband who frequented prostitutes , got mixed up in the drug business and , well . . . . . was just a bad guy . When he wouldn't grant her a divorce , she wound up getting the goods on him and rather than her spilling what she knew about his illegal activities , he hired one of the thugs he had gotten involved with , to kill her . . This took place in December of 1992 . The worst part about this story is hearing that the two little boys witnessed the murder , all three sitting in the front of their car when the hired murderer kidnapped them when they arrived home from a trip . They never even got out of their car . About a mile down the road in the ultra-quiet neighborhood , Sara screamed and the killer blasted half her head off with a sawed-off shotgun . The boys were covered in blood and ran for help . ( Try living the rest of your life with those memories . ) This episode , as almost all City Confidental episodes are , is very biased . All the people interviewed are on her the woman's side ( mostly Sara's sisters ) and nobody is pictured saying anything good about the husband . Of course , in this situation , how can you ? You can't . The only question was : " Will Tokars get the death penalty ? " Tokars did not get the death penalty , which did not please the family and friends of Sara's . .
522798	4445210	396171	9.0	Well , It Certainly Is Original And , Despite The Ending , I Found It Fascinating	Wow , this is really a bizarre story with an ending that probably will turn off 98 percent of viewers who stick with this two hours , 147-minute film . I'm not sure what to make of it , other than totally understanding if people are left unsatisfied after watching this movie . As I said , I'm not sure how to interpret it as I just finished it minutes ago . It leaves you almost stunned . Rather than judging that finale and having to use spoilers , let me just comment on the first two hours of the film , which I found utterly fascinating . If I wasn't such an admirer of photography , art and special-effects , I doubt I would have found the movie so appealing because the story is " not for everyone . " However , thanks to stunning French city and countryside scenery , 18th century period and beautiful women it enhanced the story to me . Yet , regardless of the visual treats , the story was so unusual it still would have held my attention . There are enough reviews here so that to go into the story in detail isn't needed except to say this is an " original . " I'm not familiar with any other story about a man who has such an extraordinary sense of smell that he can perform olfactory miracles and then , because of it , uses it to turn into a mass murderer . This is weird , really weird , but captivating to say the least . Ben Wishaw , who plays the lead character " Jean-Baptist Grenouille , has a face that is perfect for this role . His emaciated body , which survived a brutal childhood existence from the moment he was born also makes his character all the more credible . The looks of shock and awe on this man's face throughout the picture also add to his believability . He was mesmerizing with his haunting expressions . Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide " name " actors the film but it's Wishaw's movie , all the way . I can only recommend this movie to those who share similar interests in cinematography and who like a " different " story but there are so many things in here - especially the ending - that could offend so many people , I would be hesitant to recommend this to the general viewer . I'm going to go look for the book at our local library . I'm curious how that version compared to the screenplay .
523967	4445210	43979	10.0	Animal House	We're at the " Spinsters Arms " hotel which also has a " no pets allowed " sign outside , and we see Granny trying to enter without the house detective noticing she has a covered birdcage with her . " Don't worry , Tweety , I'll get you in somehow , " she tells her bird . Soon , another old lady is telling her pet , Sylvester , the same thing ! ( I guess I forgot about Sylvester's owner , whom you rarely see . ) Both old ladies are successful . Tweety is singing away in room 1001 and Sylvester , staying next door in 1002 , hears him and thinks " meal . " You know that the rest of the way is going to be the usual : how does the cat get the bird and , as usual , Sylvester comes up with some amazing ploys that are fun to watch beginning with an anonymous admirer's note . The action really accelerates in this one as the old bulldog we see a lot is also at the hotel and a few other surprises , all making the house detective about lose his mind . Really funny stuff with chase scenes reminiscent of the old silent film comedies .
523468	4445210	352248	10.0	' Seabiscuit ' In Human Form	Wow , this was an involving story and the best boxing movie I think I've ever seen , and I've seen most of them . It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero , heavyweight boxer James J . Braddock , played fantastically by Russell Crowe . This is another " Seabiscuit , " meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds . More than the boxing , however , this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving , supporting wife and mother . That's the crux of this biography , more than the boxing angle . Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here , who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal , while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family . Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife . After a string of some sleazy roles , it's nice to see Zellweger play this type of character . The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making . This is another reason why I label this an old-fashioned story . The primary subject's strengths , not flaws , are emphasized . Is it exaggerated ? Probably , but I have no complaints seeing a good guy look better instead of worse . One gets tired of the modern-day age of the " anti-hero . " It's nice once again to see a good man propped up instead of shot down . The third major character in the film is " Joe Gould " ( Paul Giamatti ) , Braddock's trainer and loyal friend . Unfortunately , he spits out the Lord's name in vain so many times I lost count , the only objectionable aspect of this film . But Gould was the kind of friend every guy would want . Craig Bierko gets fourth billing as Max Baer , the reigning heavyweight champ whom Braddock has to beat to get the title . Now here is where I would not be surprised if his movie character was nothing like real life because Hollywood has to have a " bad guy " to counteract the " good guy " so here it is Baer , the last obstacle in the way of Braddock's quest to be heavyweight champion . Whatever the real Baer was like I don''t know but I know Bierko does a great job in this role . The boxing scenes , supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee , are lifelike and well-done . Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style . The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining . Visually , this is a wonderful treat for your eyes . It's simply beautiful and director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors . The sets are fantastic and the clothing , cars , buildings , etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s . There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD .
527258	4445210	61086	10.0	Extremely Funny ' Inspector ' ' Effort - Maybe The Best	This was an outstanding episode , maybe the best of The Inspector that I have seen so far ( out of about a dozen ) . There is a purse snatcher on the loose and the Commissioner wants him captured because the crook had the audacity to steal his wife's purse ! Deux-Deux has the idea of the Inspector dressing up as a woman to then nabbing the thief when he tries to grab " his " purse . The Inspector gets all dressed but then thinks twice about looking like a woman and tells Deux-Deux he will have to do it . Before he gets his female clothes off , however , things begin to happen and the fun starts . Without spoiling anything , I'll just say this turned out to be a great slapstick-like story with The Inspector , the Commissioner and the Commissioner's wife all getting involved with some very , very good sight gags . This one always is beautifully drawn . It's on the DVD " The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , Vol . 6 - Inspector Cartoons . " Don't miss this one !

" This little squirrel became a big hit in the feature film and was awarded with a much bigger role in the sequel . He's now part of the Ice Age gang , if you will . This bonus short shows that he had built up quite a collection of acorns in a hollow tree . But , for some strange reason - call it " perfectionism , " that last acorn won't stay put where it is supposed to be . It keeps popping out . Instead of just leaving it as it is , which wouldn't have changed anything , Scrat goes out of his way to make it all look good . . . . . and disaster is the result . What happens when his little nest of acorns is disrupted is too wild to describe here . It has to be seen to be believed . Of course , it's outrageous but it's a cartoon , and it is fun to watch . P . S . I viewed it a second time after writing the above review . . . . and enjoyed it even more . This time I really appreciated all the funny noises Chris Wedge made , as Scat the squirrel .
522312	4445210	113277	10.0	One Of The Best Crime Films Ever	I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time . It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f - words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes , but as far as a fascinating crime story : wow ! This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film . Those two didn't disappoint , either . They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film , to me , was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee . That conversation has always fascinated me , no matter how many times I've heard it . It was such a " landmark " scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD . As with the conversation scene , the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it . The other action scenes are intense and memorable , too , and the cast in here is deep . This isn't just Pacino and De Niro . It's Val Kilmer , Ashley Judd , Jon Voight , Diana Venora , Natlie Portman , Tom Sizemore , Amy Brenamann , Wes Studi , Ted Levine , Mykelti Williamson , on and on . Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann , one of the best directors in business , add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film . At three hours long , it never bores one and at same time , doesn't overdo the action , either . I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters , but you can't have three hours of nothing but action . The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport , but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole . This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing .
522636	4445210	148543	10.0	Tons Of Sight Gags Make This ' Flip ' Cartoon A Lot Of Fun	There are more sight gags in here than you could ever hopefully expect in a seven-minute cartoon . It's just great stuff ; some of the best from UB Iwerks and his early Flip The Frog cartoons . I looked at some of the Volume One DVD of " Cartoons That Time Forget : The UB Iwerks Collection " and thought many were just " fair , " but this " Volume Two , " so far , is fantastic . This is the third Flip cartoon I've seen on this DVD and all three are wild and fantastic . The first two minutes of this one could easily be called , Flip the Paper Boy as we see all kinds of disasters that befall him as he tries to see newspapers on the street . Soon , an old maid comes by and offers him a nice big coin if he'll watch a baby in the carriage while she goes inside and shops . ( It was a MUCH more trusting world 75 years ago ! ) . What happens with Flip and the baby has to be seen to be believed ! You get chases , an assortment of wild animals , Turkish baths , tonics that make you turn into a superman , on and on . . . . . just insane things that happen one-after-the-other . Writing about this can't do it justice . If you enjoy insane cartoons where it is non-stop lunacy , you'll love this .
522507	4445210	1360788	10.0	Review Of The Blu-Ray Disc	" Wow " is the first word that comes to mind in trying to describe this concert footage of Jeff Beck at this London jazz club , " Ronnie Scott's . " I have seen Jeff Beck play guitar a few times here and there over the years , but never more than a couple songs at one venue . Now , I pretty much have an idea of all his guitar-playing talents . . . . . . and it's even more awesome than I had guessed they would be . This review , thus , is for people not all that familiar with Beck's talents . If you already are , you've already bought this DVD . In this concert , you see Beck play everything from jazz to blues to rock to ballads to " space music . " The camera-work is very good in that you really get a good luck at Jeff's ability on the guitar . You see how he produces some of his amazing sounds . You'll also see what a great band he has put together . Vinnie Colaiuta on drums , Jason Rebello on keyboards and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass are all exceptional musicians and fun to watch . All four members of this group can be seen constantly smiling and really enjoying themselves . A great addition to the Blu-Ray disc , and a reason to buy it , is the bonus material beginning with the seven-song rockabilly set with Beck and The Big Town Playboys . These guys do a great job of sounding like the late ' 50s rockers like Gene Vincent and Carl Perkins . It ends with a great sax solo on the old Bill Doggett number , " Honky Tonk . " In addition , there are interviews with everyone all they're all interesting . . . . . really . This Blu-Ray disc is worth the extra money and highly-recommended .
522337	4445210	94847	10.0	Possibly The Best Cartoon I've Ever Seen	I have seen a lot of funny cartoons , but very few which brought a big smile to my face the entire duration of the film . I just could not believe how good this was , from the hilarious animation - mainly " Mr . Johnson , " to the clever jokes that are in here one after the other after the other . Kudos to Cordell Barker for his story , direction and animation . It's an unbelievably entertaining . story of guy who finds a little yellow cat on his welcome mat outside one day , and how this cat literally destroys the house and the owner . It also shows the many attempts the man makes to get rid of the cat but , as the title say , he keeps coming back . I can see why this was nominated for an Oscar . What I don't understand is why it didn't win . I don't know how you can make a cartoon any betterThere is a DVD out , named " Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada . If for no other reason than this cartoon , purchasing that DVD would be worthwhile because this animated short is one of the best ever made
