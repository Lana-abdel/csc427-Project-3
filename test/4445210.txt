526504	4445210	87995	1.0	A Good Movie For Punks & Religious Bigots	The release date says " 1984 " but it might as well say some year in the 1970s because it had that sleazy look and hate-filled , anti-religious bias that was so prevalent in films in that decade . It usually didn't take these filmmakers long to get their religious cheap shots in , and that's the case here , too . Within 15 minutes , the was the usual dig against TV evangelists ( give it a rest ! ) and the people who listen to them , three usages of the Lord's name in vain and a ton of other profanities . it had that scummy ' 70s atmosphere right from the start . The lead character , " Otto Maddox , " ( Emilo Estavez ) is a real punk , too . This is another good example of Hollywood's hypocrisy of being " tolerant " to every group but Christians . Even if the bias doesn't bother you , the absence of a plot and the stupid dialog should . This is nothing but garbage . Punk-rockers , and just plain punks , love this film , and that should tell you something .
526026	4445210	114148	1.0	Anoher Reason For The Disney Boycott	You wonder why there was a big boycott of Walt Disney films and Disney World in the mid ' 90s and shortly thereafter . It wasn't just " Gay Days " at the theme park : it was Liberal revisionist " history " movies like this . Instead of the real story of Pocahontas , who became famous by being the first Native American converted to Christianity , we get ridiculous New Age mumbo - jumbo here . Yeah , it's the typical Disney brainwashing ( this film is for young kids ) in which the message is to worship ( not just take care of ) trees , earth , and all living things . The Disney empire is so strong on its heavy-handed left-wing agenda that it can't even remotely tell the truth about a story in an animated film . At the very least , since they abhor Christianity , they should have just stuck with a pretty animated movie ( which this is ) and centered it around romance and young America . . . but Liberals can't stop being in your face all the time , pushing their secular agendas on the rest of us . This movie is " Exhibit A " of that - a disgrace .
526865	4445210	105017	2.0	I Never Did Like John Ritter	This was supposed to be " a hilarious farce , " according to reviews of the day . It just shows you how unreliable are the movie critics you read in the newspaper . The only " farce " was that this film was lauded . The first dozen minutes along totally turned me off . In that period . John Ritter used the Lord's name in vain at least three times . That , and hundred of other " Oh , God " this and " Oh , God " that were just way too much and too annoying . I usually like Michael Caine but he's had his share of lemons , as other actors have , and this is one of them . Add in the usually-annoying Carol Burnett , Julie Hagerty and Ritter and this is easy movie to dislike . From what I hear , the stage play was far better than this flat farce .
522676	4445210	112688	2.0	Little To Like From Spike	For the longest time , it has been - or was - politically-incorrect to criticize director Spike Lee , so he gets away with murder in a number of his overrated films . Lee , in his obnoxiousness because of this fawning , doesn't care or doesn't get it that most of America doesn't want to go to a film that has over 300 profanities in it and tons of drugs and violence . If he only cares about appeasing his crowd , okay , but that doesn't mean I have to like or praise everything he does , like Roger Ebert and the rest of them . For the uniformed - and we're better off , in this case - " clockers " is a ghetto term for " drug runners or dealers . " In this story , it's drug dealers and cops , innocent people and thugs and an investigation ( is Mekhi Phifer's " Strike " guilty or innocent ? ) to get it all sorted out . Unfortunately , it takes too long for all of this to happen . In between the million f-words , and more preaching by the racist director , you have to put up with music that was so loud it drowned out the dialog a number of times . Maybe that wasn't so bad .
525361	4445210	112641	2.0	Brutally Profane	Can you say the " f-word ? ? " They can here - 353 times , according to Entertainment Weekly . This movie , as few others , will assault your senses and make you numb by the time it's over . Constant bickering , yelling , and Sharon Stone's out-of-control character the last hour will have you uttering a few expletives yourself after this Martin Scorcese sleaze-fest mercifully ends . As bad a character as Stone plays , the all-time champion profaner is - no surprise - the one played by Joe Pecsi , who must use the f-word every other sentence . Robert De Niro comes across as a choir boy compared to these other two jokers . The sad thing is , this could have been a decent movie , if Scorcese wasn't just so preoccupied with being so verbally degenerate ( see " Goodfellas , " " Raging Bull , " etc ) . If the film had been cut down 45 minutes from 3 hours ( too much of it dwells on the marital problems involving Stone ) and cut back on the profanity , you might have had an interesting crime story with some very colorful cinematography and good narration . However , Scorcese can't seem to make a crime film without all the excess . " Brutal " might be a good word to describe this movie . It's too much for anyone above trailer trash morals to endure .
526564	4445210	96142	2.0	Can''t Live Up To Its Great Title	This is the classic case of a fabulous title to a film but a horrible movie . With a name like " Sorority Babes At The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama , " I just had to check this film out . If you think the film sounds cheesy , it is - in spades . It's a sleazy horror spoof that wasn't funny and only offered some nice boobs to watch ( for us guys ) . That's about it . The two main characters were just plain annoying and too profane and , for a horror flick , it was anything but scary . I guess it was more of a comedy but outside of the " imp , " not too much of the humor was good stuff . The film showed promise early on , but once they got to the bowling lanes the film rolled a gutter ball . Oh , well . . . . it's still my favorite movie title of all time .
526453	4445210	43495	2.0	This Cartoon " Bites "	This is a cartoon warning about the evils of gambling , featuring The Gambling Bug , a creature I've never seen before in a Loony Tunes short . The bug - kind of flying ant - takes a day off and observes a big dog trying to talk a cat ( which looks like a Dr . Seuss drawing ) into gambling . The cat wants nothing to do with gambling , until the bug goes over and bites him . They play for " penalties , " and of course the cat loses . His penalty is " gesundheit . " The cat goes back and loses two more times with other penalties . This was really lame and not funny in the slightest . Why it would be included in a quality DVD " golden " or " spotlight " collections is beyond me .
527487	4445210	113280	2.0	Should Have Known From The Recommendation	The fact that " Cosmopolitan " magazine wrote this movie was " terrific " should have warned me to stay away but , like a sap , I gave it a look . What a waste of a trip to the rental store back in the late ' 90s . " Horrible " would have been a better one-word description of this profane-laden soap opera about a bunch of losers at a diner . Well , if you are a loser and like to watch people moping around like the main character in this movie - a fat momma's boy - watching a story that really has little plot or substance , this is your cup of tea . It does one thing , though : it will depress you , and a lot of sickos out there like movies that depress them . Go figure . They can relate to this " realistic " story , sad to say . I would have more compassion , but the characters in here , almost all of them , are nothing but annoying . No wonder " Cosmo " loved it .
525770	4445210	104556	2.0	Nothing But Noise - Big Disappointment	I thought maybe it was just old age creeping up on me . The Jimi Hendrix that I remember from my youth sounded a whole lot better than what I saw on this DVD . I thought I had just changed my tastes and wasn't into his songs anymore . Then I read some reviews here . . . . and I feel better . It wasn't me : it was this concert - it sucked ! I just wanted to have something on film of one of the most famous guitar players of all time , so I thought this long concert would do it . Well , this disc has already been traded for something else . All it turned out to be was noise , which was really disappointing considering the songs I liked best from him were all included in this concert . Unfortunately , they were hardly recognizable . If anyone knows of a really good Hendrix DVD , please PM me . Thanks .
527281	4445210	44953	2.0	Ryan's Laugh Was Stupid & Ruined The Film	Why one famous critic called this " possibly the greatest Western ever made " is mind - boggling . Not only is it NOT that , it's not even a good movie . In fact , it stinks ! The first 15 minutes leads you to believe this might be a great western , but by halfway through this yawner I had lost my interest . . . . both times I tried . Yeah , I gave it two attempts . What ruined the film ? Robert Ryan's laugh . Ryan , playing his usual villain role , laughed every time he talked . At first , that was kind of different and almost fun to hear but , man , did that wear thin quickly . In no time , Ryan got so annoying to hear that any pleasure from watching this movie was disappearing fast . The sad thing was the rest of the attractive cast was comprised on unlikeable characters , too ! You would think you could root for someone here . Whether it was James Stewart , Janet Leigh or Ralph Meeker playing a character , there wasn't a " good guy " in the bunch . There are hundreds of westerns better than this one .
523143	4445210	26499	3.0	Not What It's ' Cracked ' Up To Be	This was a weak effort , to be honest . It started out promising , with Humpty Dumpty Jr . , yes , the famous egg's kid . Dumpty falls from the ledge , gets caught by mother and gets a lecture on not being dumb like his father who wound up falling " and getting cracked . " What we wind up with in this story is " Junior " falling for a female egg and having to fight off " the bad egg " to get her . It drags on a bit too much with a predictable ending . In the middle and at the end we get a song about " spooning . " Overall , this wasn't one of the better efforts in the collection of a DVD called " Cartoons That Time Forget : The UB Iwerks Collection Vol . 1 . "
523549	4445210	36104	3.0	One Suspenseful Scene - That Was It	This film is part of the Val Lewton Horror Collection , released on DVD a short time ago . Each disc contains two feature films . This one was with " The Ghost Ship . " I found the latter far more entertaining than this movie . I first saw this movie in the mid ' 90s , was not that impressed , but gave it another look when I acquired the Lewton set . On the second viewing , I lost interest halfway through and stopped it . After a great start , with an extremely suspenseful scene with a woman outdoors alone on a dark street with a panther loose , but after this dramatic part the film bogs down big-time . . . . down to a crawl at times . If only the second half had kept that early momentum up . There are a lot of nighttime scenes , as was the case with a lot of Lewton's atmospheric films . Since I still own it , I'll give it another look . Who knows ? Maybe the third time will be a charm .
522549	4445210	71206	3.0	Benji ( The Movie ) Bites Big-Time	You know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case , a little dog - is the best actor on the screen ! The acting in this film is so bad , so amateurish , by dog got embarrassed watching this . He ( " Rusty , " our Golden Retreiver ) could have done a better job than the people in here . By now this is almost a trite story : kid finds animal , pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the " pet " winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family . Sound familiar ? I remember this movie being a big hit , but never got around to seeing it until the mid ' 90s on VHS . I was shocked how bad it was . Why so much fuss over a film ? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early ' 70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd ? Possibly . There wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the ' 70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories . Who could resist this cute little dog ? Not me . But the movie I can resist : it's a Grade B storyline with horrible acting . Recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and I mean " lovers " because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age .
525261	4445210	44557	3.0	Not A Good Vehicle For Monroe	" Don't bother to watch this film " would be better advice , if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles . This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast , not just Marilyn . The story was just nothing , certainly nothing like described on the VHS box , of course . There simply was no suspense , precious little excitement and too many dull spots , most of them trying to show why " Nellie " ( Monroe ) was so messed up . This was not a good role for Monroe , even though I didn't need to see this character to know she could act . " Some Like It Hot " alone was good enough evidence for me . But this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films . It's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark , Anne Bancroft , Elisha Cook Jr . , Jeanne Cagney , Donna Cocoran and others . Summary : it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .
522381	4445210	114609	3.0	Dousing Racial Fires With Gasoline	This is four short movies-in-one : four " tales , " ' so to speak . I liked the first three when I first watched this back in the mid 1990s . I did not like the fourth story . The " good " is that the stories are basically interesting and feature good sound and neat visuals . The " bad " is that they are racially-motivated and very slanted . If the roles were reserved in here - blacks and whites - people would have screamed " racism . " It's the typical double standard we have seen for awhile . Imagine if all the black people were villains and all the white people the good guys ? That's what you have here in reverse . Even on the IMDb plot line , it says the stories are " with an African American focus . " Excuse me ? ? What if it said , " made with a Caucasion American focus ? Come on , folks - stop the double-speak . Another negative is the extreme profanity , including blasphemy . Why I am not surprised that Spike Lee had a hand in this movie ? ? Those negatives sound like a typical film made by him . I really liked Clarence Williams III as the funeral parlor director spinning these stories . I thought he was consistently the best character . The punks listening to him were the worst . All four stores are horror ones and have different casts in them . All the villains were white racists . Do you think these stories help race relations , or inflame them ?
524801	4445210	112740	4.0	Hollywood Insists On Playing The Race Card	When I watched this back in 1996 , I enjoyed it was an interesting story , had two charismatic lead actors in Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington , good photography and sound and a nice feel-good ending . It still had all of that watching it five years later but then , after seeing literally several thousand films in that five-period , the reverse-racism of it disgusted me . Why is it that in every film I see in which the two main characters are white and black , the white guy is always the villain ? ? Talk about racism ! The white guy is always like Hackman's character was in here . When are the filmmakers , all of whom are Liberals , going to stop treating one race better than another ? Answers - when skin color doesn't matter anymore . Man , if this PC nonsense were the reverse , there would be a big outcry . One other complaint about the film : the ending was way too contrived . Once again , we have the clichéd ending where the " countdown " to nuclear disaster literally goes down to the last second or two .
523033	4445210	35799	4.0	Hard To Take Seriously When You See Toy Boats	The major problem with watching these 1940s films about World War II is how slow they now appear . When released , most films were of similar ilk and moviegoers were used to hearing a lot of talk , having characters developed , suspense built up and not a whole of action . That's fine , but it doesn't work today and particularly for a war movie . Hey , guys - the main audience for action films - want to see some of just action : action . Instead , what you get here , at least in the first hour which is all I remember nodding off , is talk , talk and more talk . We get characterizations of every major figure on the ship . Combine that with horrible special-effects ( this WAS made almost 65 years ago ) and you have a bad movie . Looking at an obvious scale model of submarine takes away from the story . I mean when you are laughing and recalling the days of playing with toys like this in your bathtub as a kid , it's hard to take the movie seriously . I don't mean to sound this harsh but after viewing " Master and Commander : Far Side Of The World " and " Das Boat " and a several other films involving ships and submarines , It's tough to go back and watch something that looks this unrealistic , despite a good cast and decent script . I will defend this film - and others of the period , however , for its patriotism . What a sad day it is when an American film made during WWII is now derisively insultingly called " propaganda " by a number of critics here . What do they want , a pro-Japanese or a pro - Nazi movie ? Probably .
522866	4445210	43363	4.0	What You Think Of Bullfighting Will Determine What You Think Of This	Robert Stack with blonde hair ? Could that really be " Elliot Ness ? " Well , it was the early ' 50s , before Stack made a name for himself with the TV hit , " The Untouchables . For those looking back at this film for the first time , as I did in the 1990s , this was a weird sight . Blonde or not , the main question which might answer if you will enjoy this film is , " Does bullfighting interest you ? " If it does , you'll like this ; if it doesn't , you're going to be bored . II saw the two-hour " restored " version and it looked nicely-photographed in black-and-white and very detailed about the sport of bullfighting . There were a number of scenes where I started to get bored , to be honest , and I hard time sticking with it but I have no interest in bullfighting , either . It leaves me cold . If I had interest , well , I would have a totally different outlook on the film . Kudos to Stack for doing - at least in some spots - his own bullfighting . That was impressive and shows me the man had guts . The skeet-shooting scene also was real as he was a pretty good marksman . The romantic scenes , as expected , were so-so as " Chuck Regan " ( Stack ) pursues his bullfighting coach's daughter , " Anita de la Vega " ( Joy Page ) If you love bullfighting , this film would be a " must-have " because it goes into the " sport " in some detail and even mixes in some live footage ( in the long version ) . I would suggest the longer version , anyway , because that's the way the filmmaker intended the audience to see his work . Given a choice , always see the longer version and then make up your own mind whether it should have been cut or not .
525326	4445210	106387	4.0	For Depp Fans Only	This was a generally " pleasant " film , or even " cute , " as some women might put it . . . . but not more much . It's definitely a " chick flick . " It was another early vehicle for Johnny Depp to play an oddball , something he's done ever since ( and done well ) . He's fun to watch here , too . A highlight is his impersonation of some Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin routines . Frankly , I didn't care for the rest of the lead characters , those played by Aiden Quinn ( too blasphemous ) and Mary Stuart Masterson ( nice at first , but then pouts all the time which gets tiresome ) . Quinn's girlfriend is also a brat . If you like Depp , then this is worth a look .
526980	4445210	24824	4.0	Great Ending , But Not Worth Your Time Overall	Buster Keaton plays a guy who runs " " Ye Old Clockee Shoppe " and one wonders how he can stay in business since he's completely inept at fixing timepieces . This film starts off very slowly . , taking almost half of the total time to just to set up the premise of Buster trying to win the affections of Dorothy Sebastian over a rival , played by George J . Lewis . . " Elmer " ( Keaton ) is enamored with " Paula " ( Sebastian ) the moment she walks into his shop , and the two play off each other with mild and drawn-out slapstick gags , none of which are really that funny , to be honest . After nine-and-a-half minutes , the action perks up a bit as Buster takes her to the circus on a date . Unfortunately , she's immediately taken by the trapeze artist . Poor Buster ; he can't catch a break . . She asks Buster - rather tells him - to go get an autograph from the trapeze artist who tells him , " tell the woman to come by herself . If she's good-looking , maybe I'll give her my autograph . " That tells you what kind of jerk " Apollo The Wonderful " is , which makes " Elmer " look all the better . The best parts of the film are all in the last 6-7 minutes with Buster attempting to learn how to be a trapeze artist by rigging up things in his backyard . . . . . with humorous results . The ending - the final 2-3 minutes - is almost shocking because it becomes very dramatic with Buster's lady-friend trapped in a deadly fire . . . . and you - - know-who turns out to be the hero ! I mention the end , with the spoilers alert , rather than not say anything only to warn you this really isn't a good Buster Keaton film to watch . You are far , far better off watching one of his silent films where he exhibits his comic genius . He only does that in here in those final few minutes .
522435	4445210	1009816	5.0	Popeye's ' Submarini ' Sandwich	Overall , despite one funny scene , this was pretty lame and a prime example of how these 1960-61 Popeye editions put out by King Features seemed to be made with five-year-old children as its target audience , certainly not us adults who loved the Popeye cartoons from the 1930s through the 1050s . Popeye is asked to watch the diner while Wimpy leaves to run an errand . That's fine with the sailor man because that means some good eats . He begins by " making my favorite , one of them submarini sandwiches ! " The way he makes his " submarini " is humorous . The sandwich indirectly winds up the " hero " of the story , too ! Brutus comes in the restaurant and forces Popeye - through a physical beating - to accept his jukebox as entertainment instead of the usual organ grinder and monkey , who are dispatched to the refrigerator . Meanwhile , Brutus grabs Olive , who is the cook , and runs off with her . How Popeye rescues her and beats the bully is the rest of the short story .
525987	4445210	105151	5.0	Insider's Jokes Don't Necessarily Connect With General Audience	A ton of celebrity cameos was the main thing that made this movie fun to watch , but once was enough . I wouldn't watch it again because there simply aren't enough " good guys " to suit me . The film is entertaining but has too nasty a tone to it . The language was rougher than it needed to be , but that's no surprise when you have Tim Robbins and Whoopi Goldberg starring . The story gives a look at many of the shallow people who run Hollywood . That automatically earns high praise from national film critics . Despite their innate love of Hollywood and films they somehow always love it when a film trashes the business ! Go figure . This black comedy mainly spoofs film executives . The filming is different in that you see one long scene with the camera on a crane taking turns following different people . Some of that is very clever , like the story , but I found a general smugness in this film that bordered on hypocrisy . The people who made this sometimes come off - through the film - like the folks they're criticizing . . . . . if that makes sense . Robbins is good at coming across as smug . . . . almost too good . It seems natural for him . ( I can say the same about Chevy Chase and his roles . ) Also , I find most films about Hollywood like this one : too much an inside joke for us non-film folks to really enjoy . It's like they made this film for themselves . I'm not surprised this movie was a box-office dud , since I don't think they really cared what the average guy in the seats thought about it - only their film peers .
527320	4445210	52543	5.0	Would Have Been Better Had Steiger Not Overacted Again	This is a pretty interesting film but really not all that memorable and one that you think afterward should have been a lot better . It was like watching an old television show - better , I'm sure , 50 years ago than watching it today . The story is not boring , but something was missing . Perhaps it just needed more spark . . . . and less ranting and raving from Rod Steiger who played the title character . Steiger wears thin after awhile . He has been a fine actor over the years but he tends overact in a number of his roles , too . His exaggerated anger and loudness in here ruined this film for me . Fay Spain , Martin Balsam , Nehemiah Persoff , Murvyn Vye , James Gregory and more all added excellent support , though , and I enjoyed watching them . I wish I could say the same for Steiger .
525287	4445210	26197	5.0	The Good & Bad Of ' Charlie Chan In Egypt '	I did not like this one on the first viewing , but I had a very bad tape which didn't help . With the DVD ( part of recent Chan Collection that came out in 2006 ) I enjoyed this more , thanks , in part to have the option of English subtitles . I still think this is a slightly sub-par Warner Oland-edition Charlie Chan , but only because I think so highly of the other films . It did have some excellent suspense and strange characters and is known because of the appearance of young Rita Cansino who would go on to star status as Rita Hayworth . THE BAD - None of Charlie's kids are here to help him out , and that's a loss . Instead , for humor , we have Stepin Fetchit with his mumbling drawl and unfunny character ( unlike Mantan Moreland in later Chans , even though both are horrible black stereotypes of the day . ) Worse than the above , we have a shrill , hysterical female lead character , " Carol Arnold " ( Pat Paterson ) who got on my nerves , big-time ! That's almost another stereotype of the period : women who fall apart easily and act like overemotional cripples . After a few of these outbursts , I just hit the mute button when she went into her act . She had a brother in here who was almost as bad except he had far fewer lines . Also in here was the typical thing you saw more of in the ' 30s than in modern films : stories that dealt with the occult and a lot of superstitions . THE GOOD - The action was pretty good and this story gave us more of the weird suspects than what is normally provided . Not only weird people but strange scenes . Combine those with the usual Chan witticism's , profound statements and uncommon courtesy he gives everyone , and it's an entertaining film . I would never have recognized Hayworth if I hadn't been informed it was her . She played a dark-haired Egyptian woman . If you froze some frames and looked carefully enough , you could be convinced it was her , but it wasn't easy . She certainly wasn't the incredible beauty she would be in the next decade .
526509	4445210	660578	5.0	The Good & Bad Of ' Night Court's ' First Episode	In this opening episode of a successful television show , we see the entrance of the new judge , a laid-back , blue-jean-ed young guy that is not what the other employees of a Manhattan arraignment court expected to see : judge Harold T . Stone , played by Harry Anderson . In fact , when he arrives the court clerk " Lana Wagner " thinks he's just a delivery boy bringing some of the new judge's belongings . " Harry " unveils himself as the kind of guy he is immediately with some rubber snake gag . When the first trial scene is ready to begin , the judge is a minute late and " District Attorney Dan Fielding " ( John Laroquette ) when asked what's holding him up , answers " probably a diaper change " which tells you how the others first looked at the boyish judge . Not having seen this show in a number of years , everyone looked pretty young to me , especially the guy who made the wisecrack : Laroquette . There were tons of one-liners in this show , some of them funny . No judge . obviously , would start his first case by asking everyone , " How the hell is everyone ? " That's the irreverence of the show and Anderson's character , a little too Liberal at times for my tastes . The main case is a woman trying to kill her husband after he's caught cheating with a prostitute . Harry takes the ultra-liberal approach which doesn't work but then does better when Harry becomes more of a marital counsel during the trial than a judge . The canned laughter was overdone with applause also added in a number of times , which is pushing it a little . Karen Austin overacted in her role as " Lana " and God's name was abused five times , which is one reason I haven't watch sitcoms in years .
525148	4445210	365485	5.0	Last Segment Totally Destroys The Film	I really enjoyed this movie for the first hour . It was quirky and totally unpredictable , thanks to Pierce Brosnan's strange character , " Julian . " However , when Julian knocked on the door late at the night in Denver , Colorado , at the house of his buddy " Danny Wright " ( Greg Kinnear ) , the film began to turn sour , and went down the dumper in a hurry . Julian now had overstepped his obnoxiousness and become unappealing . He had flirted with that throughout the first hour but always survived , but now he was downright rude and a pain in the butt . Making this really bad was Hope Davis , playing Danny's wife , " Carolyn . " Her character , in a flash , went from devoted , nice wife and ultra - profane " who is THIS person ? " and was insulting to any viewer with a brain . For ( about ) 20 years of marriage , she was clean-mouthed , and all of a sudden come a half dozen f-words out of her in about 20 seconds ? That typifies the whole last segment of this film , which really ruined a promising story that was looking good up until then . In a word : it has been " entertaining . " It was a stretch from the beginning , however , that a straight businessman like Wright would ever give the time of day to a drunken , super-rude swine like Julian , but I went along with it because it was fun to watch despite a few questionable homo-erotic scenes . However , when the film takes an abrupt left turn in Colorado , it lost its appeal with characters that had zero credibility .

It might be even a little bit too scary for small kids . Popeye , Olive and Wimpy come across this ghostly ship one day . ( The three of them seem to go out boating a lot , and wind up on desert islands . ) The boat has some humorous features , such as neon-type signs that change and floorboards which move up and down making music , but then its a mite sadistic as ghosts tie up our three pals and torture them , although not in any gruesome way . Yet still , as mentioned , it's a little dark for small kids to be watching . I sometimes think these early Popeye cartoons were made more for adults . Popeye then finally figures a way to fight these sadistic spirits , but isn't done in his normally-humorous fashion .
523507	4445210	52948	5.0	Fun In ' 59 , Still Okay , But Really Dated In Spots	This was very exciting when I was a kid in the late ' 50s but not so much now as an older guy . That about sums it up but it's not a surprise : a film that relies on special effects will almost always be dated very quickly . This movie is about 50 years old , so it is certainly understandable if this is far from as thrilling as it was when it came out on the big screen . ( This was pre-VHS era , too , so you could only see this on a big screen , which was actually a good thing . ) That's not to say you couldn't enjoy the movie today . Jules Verne stories were big-time in the 1950s and 60s , too , with " The Time Machine ( 1953 ) and 20 , 000 Leagues Under The sea ( 1954 ) . Around The World In Eighty Days ( 1956 ) James Mason played the lead in two of this films : this one , and 20 , 000 Leagues He plays the passionate scientist role effectively in both . If you've read Verne's novel , however , be prepared to see the opposition . Verne's book is dark ; this movie is colorful . Watching this film , it's also hard to buy a professor of geology ( " Sir Oliver Lindenbrook , " played by Mason ) and a singing student ( Pat Boone , as " Alec McKuen " ) finding things they found in the center of the earth in this movie . This is like watching those corny sci-fi " B " films of the ' 50s , except it's a major studio spending big bucks . Yet I can't really mock this effort because it does entertain and did especially 50 years ago , providing wonderful escapism for a couple of hours . However , two warnings : ( 1 ) the special - effects are terribly dated : ( 2 ) like a lot of classic-era films , you have to have a lot of a patience because things really don't start to get exciting until almost the halfway point . Today's audiences , including me , might be getting too restless by then to keep enough interest to watch the entire 132 minutes . You have to stay with it . If does get interesting , despite being totally implausible in many areas ( phony accents , how much light there is in the depths of the earth , etc . )
523458	4445210	87065	5.0	For Kids Only	This started off very strong with a fun spoof of James Bond-type spy movies with Dabney Coleman playing a secret agent using funny gimmicks in a short action scene . After that it settled down into a story of a young boy , " Davey Osborne , " ( Henry Thomas ) who accidentally stumbles onto real-life spies and with the help of his imaginary super-hero , eludes them as they chase him down . The familiar storyline of nobody believing the young boy got tiresome quickly and the cloak - and-dagger scenes were too juvenile for adults to enjoy . The kids might like as the focus is entirely on " Davey " and his little friend " Kim , " who , by the way , is very annoying and a poor actress . Coleman , meanwhile , plays a double role : the " invisible " hero and " Davey's " real-life father .
522712	4445210	404757	5.0	Different Band Members , Same Good Sound , But They Don't Connect On DV	The latest version of longtime blues-rock band concert is a long one , featuring tons of music . Everyone from the original group was gone , except Greg Allman . It is still a solid band with the same it always had . Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes both fill in nicely on guitar work . The only problem I found was the same thing I found with all the Allman DVD concerts - too much . Most of it is loud and many of the songs sound the same in concert . They don't vary the music enough and after awhile , the faster material just begins to sound like noise . I don't know why I get suckered into buying these guys ' DVDs all the time because they just aren't that great . As I said , too much of it just sounds the same . This was an expensive DVD , too . Since they aren't animated , and the lighting is nothing special , you're better off just enjoying the group on CD .
524567	4445210	106223	5.0	Good Adventure But I Didn't Care For Woods	This was a very entertaining film with lots of adventure but the lead kid , played by young Elijah Woods , got on my nerves . The sneer on his face is very annoying , although , to be fair , he could have been worse . In Mark Twain's famous book , Huck is worse than he's shown here . Sorry , but I just didn't like him . At least he cashed in on his srange looks a decade later with LOTR . Speaking of the book , Disney gets in its typical anti-Christian cheap shot by having Jason Robards dress up as a fake minister , even though that was NOT part of the book . Racism is a key part of this story , too , and Courtney B . Vance is very likable as the slave . He's just one part , however , of a number of characters and adventures in here . The movie is nicely filmed , too ; very colorful . It was good for one viewing , but that was it for me .
525574	4445210	35047	6.0	' The Biggest Chiselers In Town '	Oh , boy : more corny signs . The boys are in ancient Rome and are stonecutters . The sign over their front door of business reads , " Ye Olde Pottery and Stone Works - Mohicus , Larrycus And CurleyCue - The Biggest Chiselers In Town " Emperor " Octopus Grabus " has issued an edict in which all unmarried redheads are ordered to the palace of for matrimony . One hot babe is pursued and runs into the boys ' store looking to be hidden from a Roman soldier . The boys are happy to oblige . My first or second look at this particular story probably made me laugh but now , some 40-50 years later , I had seen Curly pretend to be a woman so many times that isn't funny , anymore . The scenes with him and the Mr . Magoo-like " Octopus " ( Vernon Dent ) What I am saying is that is just too much familiar material . To end on a positive note , the " dame " in trouble , " Diana , " played by Marjorie Deanne was very hot . I'm surprised she didn't have a longer career , unless that was her choice .
527188	4445210	70248	6.0	Great Music , Visuals But The Story Is Lame	Great soundtrack , great visuals , somewhat confusing and disappointing storyline . I always thought this was Neil Diamond's best work . He sang the soundtrack , and it's filled with great songs that he did exceptionally well . The photography is beautiful and the scenes as mellow as you can find : a seagull gracefully gliding through the air surrounded by beautiful seascapes , sunsets , billowy clouds . . . . . just magnificent scenery . On the negative side is the usual New Age " look within yourself " theology . This is pure Secular Humanism . I say this because some people thought this was a Christian film and it is not . It only confuses people because there are analogies that could easily apply to Jesus , to the Pharisees and to Heaven itself . It was a bunch of mixed messages but author Richard Bach , from whose book this movie is based on , leaves no doubt near the end of the movie - or the screenwriters did , if they changed his book . Still , a peaceful , calming movie that is unique .
527082	4445210	60837	6.0	Unique Ending Helps Save Mediocre Effort	Our boy is obviously trying to become a great violinist , as we see pages of instructions and lessons littered on his floor . After a few notes , we can tell he is anything but ready . Nonetheless , he packs his violin and heads out to a concert hall ( which looks like Albert Hall in London ) , where he promptly gets booted out . Later , however , when the real concert starts , featuring Beethoven's Fifth Symphony , the Panther sneaks back inside and sets himself up in the orchestra ! ( What happened to the Security ? ) Most of the " story " is simply the Pink Panther playing different instruments and tormenting this temperamental conductor during the concert . You couldn't root for either party as the PP had no business there and the conductor was an idiot . Although certainly not boring , I found very little funny in this cartoon but the last minute was " cute " and one of the most unique endings in this series .
527033	4445210	364725	6.0	' Patches ' Mends This Tired Formulamatic Comedy	Well , here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes . For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years . . . . and this is a prime example . By the way , this is an " R " all the way , if any concerned parents are reading this . You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really , really stupid . Both of those are typical , too . Yet , most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out . Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments , mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru , " White Goodman , " a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center . Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller , sort of like David against Goliath , the nerds against the jocks . . . . . another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk . Christine Taylor is the token young " hottie " that you also see in these kind of pictures : skinny , pretty , but not exactly the wholesome type . Rip Torn almost steals the show as " Patches O'Houlihan , " the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods . I laugh every time I think of him . In fact , " Patches " puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a " fair " rating . A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story . Of course , it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half , so it's not all bad .
522305	4445210	53125	6.0	Okay . . . . But It Seemed A Lot Better When I Was A Kid	When I started collecting videos in earnest ( by the thousands ) , I was excited to get this film . I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen . I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore . I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again . Well , seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment , mainly because the first hour was so boring . The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse , were drawn out too long , such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint . Once Grant goes on the run , the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move . From that point , it's still the fun film I had remembered but , overall , didn't have the suspense anymore and , to this day , I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film . The more I see of Hitch's old films , the more disappointed I am , with the exception of Psycho and Rear Window .
523228	4445210	95953	6.0	Cruise's Abrasive Character Ruins This For Me	Once again , here's a film I liked a lot on the first viewing , but less and less on subsequent ones and finally calling it quits after the third look . By then , Tom Cruise's character " Charlie Babbitt " was too much to take . It wasn't entertainment to listen and see his profane , arrogant , mean-spirited character . Yeah , he comes around to some decency in the end but it's too little-too late for me . Dustin Hoffman , of course , gained a lot of recognition for his idiot-savant role of Cruise's brother " Raymond Babbitt . " It's tough to root against a mentally - disabled person , even if he's math wizard . As interesting a story as this is , and as is Hoffman's acting and character , Cruise ruins this film for me . For others who wouldn't be offended , I highly recommend the movie as it's an involving story and Hoffman's performance alone is worth the rental .
526848	4445210	35549	6.0	' We Don't Wanna Seista ; We Wanna See Delores ! "	It's those kind of puns in the subject head above that make this Stooges-in-Mexico short humorous at times , but overall it is not one of their more memorable movies although it could have been given the Mexican locale . Mostly it's just the normal Moe sticking his figures in Curly's eyes type slapstick . The skit in which the boys have no clue what the Mexican is saying because he speaks Spanish is lame and goes on too long . Suzanne Kaaren as " Dolores Sanchez , " was pretty ; kind of a poor man's Rita Hayworth with her hairstyle , body and looks . She was offered a role as a Ziegfield girl at the tender age of 15 , and then later had her legs insured for a million bucks . . . . . so the Rita Hayworth comparison wasn't exaggerated , although Rita was . . . . . . . well , Rita . I was hoping the bullfight scenes at the end of this Stooges short would be hilarious but they were only so-so , and should have been funnier . Overall , this was okay - I did laugh out loud a few times - but not one of the more laugh-producing shorts the boys made over the years .
526231	4445210	94608	6.0	Memorable , But Not Oscar-Worthy	I remember this being somewhat of a controversial film when it came out , probably because the rape scene was too graphic for many people . The subject of rape , in itself , is not new to films so it must have been the way it was presented . ( I am writing this from memory . ) I do remember the scene as extremely uncomfortable to watch . In a nutshell , Jodie Foster plays a woman , " Sarah Tobias " who goes looking for trouble in a bar and gets much more than she bargained for , being gang-raped on top of a pinball machine . She then goes to court to prosecute the men involved . This was an out-and-out " women's lib movie " and since they are given favorable press by the politically-correct media , the film got extra publicity . Even for feminists , though , this story has too many holes in it to be as credible as we would like it to be . The had a female prosecutor , of course , and Kelly McGillis just didn't cut it in that role , just not convincing . Also , with Hollywood , when you hear " based " on a true story , you know facts will be few and far between and the dramatic parts will be very exaggerated . None of this implies , by the way , that the victim deserved what she got . In fact , I hope some women learned from this movie and never put themselves in a spot where something horrific like this could happen . Alcohol and sex desires are a lethal combination and a bar with a number of drunks is not where you want to start arousing people . Jodie Foster is a fine actress but I did question her winning an Oscar over this . Too much of the Academy Awards in the last two decades have become nothing but political forums ( always favoring the latest left wing cause ) . In this case , the feminists were appeased . Foster has done better work in other films and not been recognized . Overall , I think this film is good for one viewing but a little too unpleasant for more than that .
527474	4445210	35937	6.0	A Rebellion Against " Authority "	This was pretty good entry in the Val Lewton Horror Collection , even though it's anything but " horror . " This film is a straight drama , almost a film noir about a paranoid sea captain ( Richard Dix ) who eliminates anyone who disagrees with his " authority , " a key word in this movie . Russell Wade is the captain's protégé , and the story really centers around him and the conflict he has with his boss after he begins to find out what a violent nutcase he happens to be . Along the way , it was noteworthy to see Lawrence Tierney play one of the captain's victims . Also good was Jacob " Sparks " Winslow as the ship's radio operator . This is an involving film as we root for Wade to expose this captain and to convince others that the man with the " authority " is an evil person .
523889	4445210	264464	7.0	Pretty Interesting Look At An Impersonator	This is kind of an odd story , another one of those based-on-a-true life tales . This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered . However , it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way . He did all of this in his teenage years . Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight - and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail . Although not a tense thriller , the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting , capped off by a satisfying ending . The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio ( as " Frank Abagnale " ) taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls . This guy was no hero , believe me .
522453	4445210	295701	7.0	Diesel Is Decent As Latest Macho-Hero	Vin Diesel is a pretty good guy to play these new action-heroes . Like " The Rock , " he's a big , muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for . Unfortunately , a number of these testosterone-filled action films , including this one , are somewhat moronic in nature . However , they are undeniably entertaining . You can always depend on one thing in these type of movies , from the " biker movies " of the ' 50s to today's films : the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land . Also , an even more-recent theme is to have the government actually employ the rebel to get the job done because their men are unable to accomplish what this ultra-tattooed macho man can do ! It's so much garbage , but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts . Like Arnold Schwarzenegger before him , and Steven Seagal , Jean-Claude Van Damme , Chuck Norris and then " The Rock , " these kind of muscle-men have fairly clean mouths and at least some ideals . For pure action , the movie succeeds because , in the end , it does entertain which is the name of the game .
523540	4445210	60843	7.0	Colorful Travel Scenery Is The Highlight	This was mildly entertaining . There aren't really any laugh-out-loud jokes but it's interesting to watch our two good guys - The Inspector and Deux-Deux - travel from Paris to Egypt to Mount Kilimanjaro and then back to France . The scenery and artwork with it are very colorful and fun to look at , and make up for the so-so gags . It's mainly the two guys trying to catch a mysterious " Mr . X " and their inability to nab him . There is a surprise ending here , appreciated by all but Clouseau . This cartoon can be seen on the DVD " The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , Vol . 6 - Inspector Cartoons .
524852	4445210	148422	7.0	The Good & Bad Of Lord Of The Dance	GOOD NEWS - This musical-dance performance is astonishingly beautiful . When I first saw this , I was stunned . I had never so many beautiful colors on one stage in my life ! It's just an awesome production , visually-speaking . Not only are the colors spectacular , so is the lighting , and the beautiful of some of the females , particularly a violin player and a dancer in a red dress . Those two women were not just gorgeous , but talented . . . . . but then again , who wasn't ? Like " Riverdance , " the play varies its acts well , going from tap dancing to instrumentalists , from fast to slow songs , ballet , you name it . Michael Flatley is a great dancer and is without doubt the star of the show . . . . which leads me to . . . . THE BAD - Flatley , unfortunately , knows he's the star and his ego is more than apparent here . That whole bit with the bared chest certainly is one clue that he suddenly thinks of himself as some sex symbol . It doesn't help that he has these young screaming idiot girls in the audience literally shrieking every time he comes on stage . Perhaps he is a symbol , at least to those teen ( I assume ) girls . Flatley didn't annoy me : the shrieking audience did . They ruined the audio of this performance , often drowning out the music with their idol - worshiping screams . It really detracted from a fine show .
523505	4445210	95785	7.0	Probably The Worst Day You've Ever Seen Anyone Have	B-r-u-t-a-l ! ! ! We see this story through the eyes of one man , who has a bad day . . . . . to say the least . So many incredible things happen to him in a short period of time that your jaw will drop watching this . Just to give you an idea : he begins by accidentally shaving off his nose . Later , his problems drastically escalate from a dog who won't let go of him , to a steamroller who flattens him to explosions and a few other things that are actually somewhat disgusting to watch ! It's all done in cartoon's Bill Plympton's wild style of artwork . The animated short runs only seven minutes but so many horrible things happen it seems like the story is longer , believe me ! This was included in the DVD titled , " Plymptoons : The Complete Early Works Of Bill Plympton . "
524843	4445210	86969	7.0	A Strange , Depressing Character Study	This is a strange and fascinating - but that likable - story about a kid who becomes obsessed with birds and then literally goes crazy . Matthew Modine plays the introverted " Birdy . " A young Nicholas Cage plays his best friend , " Al . " It's not a particularly pleasant story . In fact , it's downright depressing many times . It also had an unusual ending , one the critics seemed to all pan but I liked . I thought it was neat . The movie does keep your interest , so it gets decent points for that , and it certainly presents a unique character study . I haven't seen this film in a long time , but after writing this review , I'd kind of like to view it again . . . . . depressing or not .
526368	4445210	113972	7.0	Very Suspenseful For One Look	This is one of the most suspenseful movies you'll ever see , but that good for only viewing . After you've seen it , the impact is greatly lost for further viewings . It got panned by many critics for having too far-fetched a storyline , and I agree . However , if you can put your brain on " hold " for 90 minutes , you'll enjoy the movie . The only annoying part for me was the typical Liberal bias in here where the Liberal politician is the target of a Conservative fanatic . They never show you the other way around . At least the writers here were somewhat subtle . As interesting the characters as Johnny Depp usually plays , the two villains in here were more fun to watch than him . Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia were riveting as the killers . Depp actually played a normal person , which is not normal for him . The suspense was so good , I could hardly watch parts of this . That was the best part of the movie . The worst may have been the so-overplayed cliché of the killers hesitating before shooting and then , because of that , being shot themselves . That is so tiresome . Or sometimes the crooks talk instead of shoot , and then are shot . It's one of critic Robert Ebert's biggest pet peeves and I agree with him . It's another reason this film got low grades by most critics . However , this " real time " movie ( trying to get the viewer even more involved ) , is guaranteed , if you've never seen it , to give you an entertaining hour-and-a-half .
526645	4445210	105483	7.0	Interesting Look At Hassidic Way Of Life	Here's a very low-key movie that centers around Hassidic Jews and their lifestyles , similar to what " Witness " was with the Amish people . I found it to be interesting look at the Hassidic way of life . The first half of the film is much better than the second half , or this would rated higher . It has two big things going for it : wonderful golden-hued cinematography and not much gratuitous sex and profanity . It's probably too low-key , at least in that second half which needed more suspense and action to be a better-liked and known film . Despite being difficult believing the soft-spoken Melanie Griffith as a tough NYC cop , she still does an excellent job in the lead role and Eric Thai , ditto , as the romantic interest . There are a few disappointments in the last part of the film but the very ending is good and surprised me .
526298	4445210	941918	7.0	Cheetah's Learning To Survive , Family-Style	I'm not sure if this is the same episode as the one I saw , but it's the only one listed under " Cheetah " here . It's the tale of a cheetah family of brothers trying to survive in the huge wildlife preserve in Botswana . One of the three brothers , named Achilles , is the hunting leader of the three . He leads all the time while the other two follow . However , one day he gets killed by a deadly cobra . Now , the other two - who don't know what happened to him and are lost - are shown trying to make things on their own . They almost starve to death in the process , having depended so much on their older brother in the past . In the end , a lone cheetah winds up joining them and once again , they are three . Along the way of this journey , we learn about the speed , grace and personality quirks of the cheetah , including the all-important " territorial rights . "
526981	4445210	870902	7.0	Looney Tunes ' Effort Into WWII	If you watched the recent Ken Burns documentaries on World War II , you know how much America - all its citizens and businesses - went to bat in a unified effort to win that war . Well , the makers of the famous Looney Tunes cartoons put in their fair share , too . That is documented in this behind-the-scenes featurette on the Golden Collection Volume Three disc 4 DVD set . The topics of rationing , blackouts , being drafted , working in a Defense Plant , selling bonds and , of course , actually participating as soldiers were all part of a number of Looney Tunes during the period of the early-to-mid 1940s . It's pointed out by several historians , critics and directors that some of the cartoons were made just for soldiers , such as " Pvt . Snafu . " They believe that this led to much more brassier , bolder and edgier cartoons , that WWII actually helped propel cartoons into their " golden age " by the mid ' 40s . Also , writer-producer Paul Dini and others comment how " Bugs Bunny captured the American spirit so clearly . "
526371	4445210	110632	7.0	One Of The Wildest , Sickest & Craziest Films You'll Ever See	Yikes , this is a sick movie and one of the wildest I've ever watched . THE GOOD - This is so stylishly-filmed it's unbelievable . The wild camera techniques - quick flashes , sudden changes from color to black-and-white and back , distorted sound bytes , tilted camera angles , wild colors and symbolic images , distorted sound bytes - are all fascinating to watch . Then there's the crazy story , which ranges from really good to really bad . It's good to see the tabloid media mentality mocked for the trash it is , glorifying evil just to get ratings and the evil killers feeding off that media frenzy . Most of the characters in this film , as bad as they are , are definitely attention-getting . The two leads , " Mickey and Mallory " are two names that now go together , thanks to this film and the ultra-sleazy portrayals of them by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis . THE BAD NEWS - Most of the people in this film , if not all , are so vile , so profane , so morally bankrupt , so disgusting you want to take a shower after watching this film . Even the film critics who gravitate toward evil were repulsed by this movie . I actually enjoyed the story up to a point : about the halfway mark . After that , it becomes one gigantic mess , almost too difficult to watch in one sitting . I am mainly referring to all the scenes in the prison including the drawn - out riot / prison break , which goes on way too long . Over 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain - almost all of them in the second half of the movie , didn't help in my rating . Tommy Lee Jones , as the warden , and Robert Downey , as the Aussie scumbag tabloid reporter , absolutely go over-the-top . OVERALL - In order to stomach this film , you have to look at it as some outrageous satire on violence and the media and take these characters as extreme cartoon-like people and nothing else . Take nothing seriously here . It might help to wear earplugs , too , in profanity and just plan noise bother you .
524006	4445210	840825	8.0	People Will Bet On Anything !	Some jewelry business hotshot is hosting a party for the young-and-beautiful when gun - toting thieves interrupt the fun with a robbery . The host says about $30 million of his stuff was being worn by the guests , who wind up killing two of the people , one of them a Paris Hilton-type socialite named " Dakota Hudson " who was in the swimming pool . A big twist is revealed early on as it's discovered that the bullet that killed her was fired from in the water , so there was a third shooter . Was that killing tied in with the robbery or was it separate ? The top two suspects are the ones who had Hudson on their " Death Pool " list , a list of about five people who they are betting on will die within a certain time or before others ( sick , eh ? ) . The " pool " is run on a boat three miles offshore which makes it untouchable to the local police . Once again , this is another stylishly-photographed episode . I've noticed the cameramen have turned up their visual tricks with some added photo gimmicks this season . That's fine with me ; it makes it all the more fun to watch and the colors have always been spectacular on this show . CSI : Miami has a lot of glitz but I think that's what makes it distinctive and fun to watch , among other things . Overall , it isn't a particularly-involving story but it is good enough and I always like to see the human side of David Caruso's character , who seems to have extra compassion for little kids who are victims of their morally-bankrupt parents . When Horatio promises to look after a child , he always delivers .
522456	4445210	290334	8.0	More Of Same Eye-Popping FX	Since the first movie , " X-Men , " was famous for its great special effects , this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans . . . . and it did ! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects , both visually and audibly . All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film . Having said that , I do think the film needed some lulls . At over two hours of pretty intense action , it needed more breaks . It's just too much . Either that , or shorten the story . Rebecca Romjin-Stamos , in her skin-tight outfit , is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad , either ! Other familiar names from the first film are still here , such as Patrick Stewart , Hugh Jackman , Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan . It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution " as a fact " early on once again , they do have something unusual in today's films : a Christian character who was a good guy . All in all , if you liked the first film , you'll like this .
522726	4445210	43924	8.0	The Truth Has A Way Of Sneaking Up On You	This 1950s melodrama was an interesting , involving story . It's part film-noir , too , which I liked . I say that because the last third of the film featured an expectation of some dreaded act about to be committed , giving it a film noir feel . One thing for sure , whatever you label the movie : it's well-acted , well-directed and well-photographed . Regarding the latter , this really looks good on DVD . No surprise it's directed well since George Stevens was the director . His resume speaks for itself . Obviously Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor are the " big names " in this film , but I found Shelly Winters and the character she played to be the most intriguing . She wasn't really appealing yet one could certainly identify with her feelings of insecurity with Taylor as her competition . " Liz " was in in her prime , looks-wise , with an absolutely classic face . Anyway , watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting . Clift , as is the case with most of us , causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him . The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth . It comes back to bite you , big-time ! I really found it refreshing , however , to see Clift's attitude at the end . It's the exact opposite of what you hear today . He actually takes responsibility for his actions .
524982	4445210	910795	8.0	So Quiet It's Spooky	The one thing the viewer - at least me - gets most out of after watching this episode is the solitude of this rocky area , the overwhelming quiet of this part of the United States . . . . . so much so that it could literally drive one crazy , if you didn't have human company . " It's TOO quiet , " says our host and " survivor " Les Stroud . Our host winds up talking to a bird , after a few days of dead silence . The other thing that bugs Stroud the most , it appears , is the drastic changes in temperature from hot when the sun's out to bitter cold during the night . That , and , of course , a lack of water in the area . " Dehydration , " noted Stroud , " and the threat of it killing you is much worse than starvation . " In the end , he gets the heck out of there , even if it is a day earlier than planned . Lack of water and food will do that to you . Along the way , however , Stroud shows his survivor talents with some interesting tips on how to keep fires going . Who knew that those tasty little corn chips would be good kinder ? Or that cow patties are such a big help to keeping a campfire going for hours . . . . or that eating a little squirrel would be enjoyable ?
526630	4445210	1066295	8.0	' Wilbur ' Gives Us Facts About Pigs & Spiders And The Training Of Animals	" Flacka " is one of the real pigs who played " Wilbur " in the film " Charlotte's Web . " The young boy who voiced " Wilbur , " Dominic Scott Kay ( who gets no film credit on the back of the DVD even though he has the most lines , and gets 11th listing on the cast page here on IMDb ) gives us some facts and figures and takes us behind the scenes with the training of the animals . We talks as if he is explaining things to other kids but there are many interesting facts are animals that adults can learn a lot , too . What's " amazing , " Dominic's favorite word , is to see a sheep shaking hands , like a dog would be trained , or a pig walking backwards on command , and a few other things . Animal trainers are pretty special , patient people as we see here . Dominic also shares some very interesting facts about pigs and spiders that most people probably don't know , such as why pigs love the mud and that spiders eat their webs to help make new ones . The answer to the pigs and mud is : 1 - to protect their pale skin from sunburn ; 2 - to cool off , because they don't have sweat glands , and 3 - to protect against biting flies .
527260	4445210	60976	8.0	Another Take On Jekyll & Hyde	This reminded me of a Tom and Jerry cartoon ( I think it was them ) in which Jerry turned into a monster a number of times , going back and forth between mouse and monster . It was a take on the famous Dr . Jeckyll & Mr . Hyde story . That's what happens here as Deux-Deux takes a drink at a mad scientist's house and the green stuff turns him into a big green monster for a few seconds . It's during those moments he terrorizes and pulverizes the Inspector . It happens faster and faster as the cartoon evolves with rapid-fire gags as this personality switch begins happening every few seconds . This wasn't that humorous but it was very entertaining and fast-moving , thus , it still warrants an " 8 " rating simply because it was fun to watch . It's on the DVD " The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection , Vol . 6 - Inspector Cartoons . "
523107	4445210	166924	8.0	Another Strange-But-Fascinating Film From That Strange Director	Wow , what a strange film . It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird . I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film . I can't be done . After some research following my second viewing of this film , I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look , and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help , it is hard to figure things out . So , if you're in that boat and was confused , don't feel bad ; that's normal . Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts ' character . At any rate , I find the film fascinating . I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch . The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy , a la Lynch's " Blue Velvet . " There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes . In all , it's very well scored . Like Lynch's " Twin Peaks " television series , this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long , drawn-out TV series . When that didn't happen , he pieced at the last minute this ending . That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear . The theme of the story , supposedly , is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people , especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed . Both Watts and the other leading lady , Laura Eleana Harring , are very interesting to watch , especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene . Looks - wise , both women were chameleons , looking average at times , stunning at other times . I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first . It's not just a curiosity piece ; it's a very intriguing movie . . . . . just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things .
522651	4445210	53143	8.0	Good Laughs , Interesting Cast	As with most movies from a different era , the attitudes are quite different . Feminists would hate this movie , if they saw it today . Hollywood would never make it now in first place , unless roles were reversed and men were made to look like sex objects . That would meet PC double standards . Nonetheless , agendas aside , there is a lot of good humor in here ; the story is interesting , and you get a well-known cast with Cary Grant , Tony Curtis , Dina Merrill , Arthur O'Connell , Gavin MacLeod and Marian Ross . The latter went on to be big names on television more than movies , MacLeod on " Mary Tyler Moore " and Ross on " Happy Days . " This was Happy Days on a ship , at least when some attractive women board the vessel . Grant has the best lines in the film - speaking lines , that is . Good entertainment . Lots of laughs before the PC made it impossible to laugh at anything , including ourselves .
527143	4445210	104940	8.0	My Favorite Version Of This Famous Story	In terms of humor or songs , I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film . The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic : very Christian-like and very profound . Scrooge ( Michael Caine ) , meanwhile , is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions . His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring , generous person is done more subtly , too , than in other films . However , to be fair , sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story . The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing . Not much offensive in here , either , making this a good film for little ones as well as older , sentimental folks .
524714	4445210	79116	8.0	Even Better If You've Seen The Famous Site	An excellent second half of this film elevates it overall as the Alcatraz inmates plan and then execute their escape , narrowly missing several disastrous occurrences . The suspense during those scenes is outstanding . Clint Eastwood is good as the fairly low-key character " Frank Morris " and most of the inmates are likable guys ( which was highly unlikely in real life ) . For tourists of San Francisco ( of which I was one about five years ago ) , I would recommend taking the Alcatraz tour . It's fascinating and makes this movie even more interesting once you've seen the place . I notice the people here at IMDb make the same recommendation on the title page of this film . Much of the rest of the cast are not well-known actors but they do a fine job in here . This is one of director Don Siegel's final films . He worked with Eastwood on " Coogan's Bluff " and then " Dirty Harry . " Transfer-wise , the DVD was not that impressive , a bit too grainy for the usual standards . However , the story is always interesting and the movie is definitely recommended .
524323	4445210	44843	8.0	Seal-ing The Deal	This is more of a " cute " story than a comedy , although it has both charm and laughs , along with some nice artwork . In essence , a baby seal escapes from the zoo . The animal is tired of blowing horns ; his job is boring . He tells this to Jerry Mouse after winding up in the swimming pool where Jerry and Tom live . After Tom , Jerry and the seal all hear that there is a $10 , 000 reward for the return of the seal , Tom goes after him . The normal chase scene is a bit different because Tom is chasing a seal , not Jerry , and Tom has to perform circus acts ( high wire and such ) to catch the seal . Funny sight gags included Jerry helping to produce a " dancing fish " and Tom doing his high - dive into a glass of water . The show features an odd ending : one , of course , that could never happen and one that you wonder , " Why would Tom be content doing this ? "
522729	4445210	824379	8.0	Phil Collins Gives You A Lot Of Bang For Your Buck - Almost Too Much	Phil Collins gives a long seriously long concert in Berlin , Germany , on July 25 , 1990 , doing 24 songs ! This is one of the longest one-man concert videos I've ever seen . Actually , as good as Collins ' songs are , and as good a singer as he is , it's almost too much . . . . at least for one continuous viewing . It's almost three hours of music ! I was surprised all of this could fit on a VHS tape . I'm not complaining , just saying it is very hard to sit down and watch this whole thing in one viewing . After the first look , I wound up breaking it into segments , and even skipping a number of songs that didn't have as much appeal as others . That's hard to do on the VHS tape I had , but I assume much easier on the DVD , which I wouldn't mind acquiring one day . Like all good performers , he has excellent backup help , instrumentally and vocally . The lighting also is very colorful in here which definitely adds tot he view-ability of the concert . You need colors and other visual gimmicks ( dry ice , in here ) , otherwise you're better off with just a CD . Phil , to his credit , is pretty animated , too , which also helps . He is so self-assured that feels comfortable with the huge crowd , even though he doesn't speak their language . ( He has to read his German from a sheet of paper . ) Anywhile , like Rod Stewart and others with unlimited energy , Phil just keeps going and going . Although some songs sound very similar , it's still very good , solid music and entertainment . You sure get your money's worth ! "
524315	4445210	265666	8.0	' Quirky ' Seems To Be The Most Popular Word To Describe This	This was a quirky film that surprised me , in that I liked it . . . . at least twice . By the third viewing , I had enough but I got my money's worth out of it . That's what I would recommend with this movie : rent it before considering buying it . It's very different , and you might love but also might hate it . What it is , simply , is a portrait of a very dysfunctional family and the father trying to re-connect with his kids after a long absence . Gene Hackman is the father , Angelica Huston the mother and the wacko kids - and other assorted strange characters - are played by Ben Stiller , Owen and Luke Wilson , Gwyneth Paltrow , Ben Stiller , Bill Murray and Danny Glover . This is mostly dry , dark humor with some funny lines delivered in deadpan style . Nobody is particularly likable but - with the possible exception of Paltrow's character - are not really unlikeable either . They are just strange . I enjoyed viewing the house with all its colors . For those who appreciate low-key absurd humor nd some pleasing visuals , you should like this film and I certainly recommend giving it a look .
526567	4445210	59742	8.0	A Beloved , Very Likable Film , But Twice Was Enough	I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film , something I did in 1998 . . . . and I could see why this is such a beloved film . I watched it one other time , about five years later on DVD , but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else . However , I still have a high regard for the film . The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or ' 40s - a super-nice , old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews , who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here . In fact , her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years . Too bad . At least here , she's a joy to watch . The kids are all nice , attractive and well-behaved , something else you don't see much anymore on film . Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up , he's fine , too , as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn . Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis ( which include Eleanor Parker ) - aren't prevalent . They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story . The film is nicely photographed , too , and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps . I did think there were too many songs in here , something of them done twice . That's too much . Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough . ( I'm not big into musicals . ) On my second viewing , for some reason , I found the movie too boring in too many spots , which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total . It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it . I am glad at least I could enjoy this once .
523597	4445210	782223	8.0	Finding The Kidnap Victim & Soap Opera In The CSI Office	Some bimbo sipping her cocktail at an outdoor restaurant table gets a call on her cellphone from a desperate woman . She almost hangs up but stays on and hears this woman pleading for help , asking " Mitch " to save here . She obviously dialed the wrong number but at least the bimbo - who is shown to be really shallow - does the right thing by going to a nearby policeman . " Lt . Horatio Caine " ( David Caruso ) conveniently is nearby and he takes the phone from her and hears a man threatening the woman followed by a shouts from a male and then a gunshot . The CSI quickly finds out who she was really calling . ( It's a little too quick for believability considering all the numbers involved . ) They discover that " Mitch " is her husband she was trying to call him . He knows about the kidnapping because he'd received a ransom and death threat if he called the cops . He's frantic , but cooperates with Lt . Caine . The rest is the usual : every suspect they have who looks like the guilty party only leads them to the next step . This is typical for the CSI shows where you usually don't see the real killer until the end . Anyway , nothing special but a decent show . A quick sidebar as " Ryan Wolfe " ( Jonathan Togo ) trying to date " Natalia " ( Evan LaRue Callahan ) . She was Eric Delko's ( Adam Rodriguez ) former girlfriend who still , obviously , has feelings for the latter . It's all very soap opera stuff but the writers like to fit this kind of stuff in every show .
527252	4445210	452042	8.0	The Likes And Dislikes Of The Marx Brothers	This documentary has an appropriate beginning , showing a number of people reciting one adjective apiece to describe the Marx Brothers . I don't have to repeat them here ; you know what people are going to say - mostly things like " zany . " I liked what Carl Reiner said : " our court jesters . " Yup , for years - especially in the 1930s with films like " A Day At The Races , " the Marx Brothers were America's court jesters . In this half hour collection of comments and scenes from the MB films , we learn about these famous comedians and some of the reasons their movies were so likable . We learn how and why their stage careers helped them immensely in their films and how some of their best-known movies have similar characteristics . We learn what a key man Irving Thalberg was to their career and how much he was missed after his tragic death at the age of 37 . Jack Warner replaced him and Groucho and the boys did not get along with him . When Thalberg died , in effect , so did excellent Marx Brothers films . They loved Thalberg but hated Mayer and director . ( You'll have to see this to find out who ! ) There are all kinds of stories in here about the boys , except for Zeppo who wasn't on film long with the other three . It was nice to see Margaret Dumont receive a tribute for her contributions and it was almost shocking to hear about Chico's exploits with the women . This guy got about every woman in Hollywood , it was said in here , which made Groucho - who also loved the women - very jealous . Speaking of women , we see Maureen O'Sullivan today talking about Groucho . It's always interesting to see what classic-era movie stars look like today and I give people like O'Sullivan credit for doing the interviews knowing she's an old lady now , not the glamor girl of the past . Her comments on rebuffing Groucho's advances were fun to hear . If you're a Marx Brothers fan , this is a " must " bonus feature to watch . It can be viewed on " A Day At The Races "
525851	4445210	105690	8.0	This Seagal Flick Took The Cake	This was a fast-moving Rambo-style action flick ( good guys never get hit despite 10 , 000 rounds of ammunition fired at them ) that was very popular . It spawned a very weak sequel , par for the course . Several reviewers here wrote that it is Steven Seagal's " best movie , " and I wouldn't argue with that . . " Under Siege " probably was more popular than the normal Segal action flick because of several aspects : 1 - the interesting story featuring the " lowly cook " ( as Seagal described himself in this film ) beating a bunch of terrorists taking over a U . S . Navy vessel ; 2 - the over-the-top villains portrayed by fun-to-watch actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey , and 3 - the fabulous looks and body of Erika Eleniak , who pops out of a cake topless in a sight that every guy who saw this film remembers . Jones was just about hitting his acting career peak as he demonstrated the following year with his Oscar-winning performance in " The Fugitive . " Busey was the opposite , nearing the end of his run after a starring role as singer " Buddy Holly " made him famous . This film might be Segal's most successful , or at least in the top three . His star has faded since the new century . Eleniak never made it far past the cake . She played " Elly May " in " The Beverly Hillbillies " the following year and nothing but ' B ' films after that . The first part of this movie is far better than the second . It gets out-of-control by the end , as most of these action films do with the violence overdone and with little credibility . But watching the three leads , and ogling Eleniak , always make this film fun to watch for a little while , at least .
526877	4445210	52149	8.0	Familiar Storyline But With A Few New Wrinkles	Although this story takes place back in the old days of France , the storyline is one that was used many times in modern settings in Tom and Jerry cartoons : a threat by an adult to Tom to do something about " the mouse " or it was curtains for the cat . Usually , it meant being tossed out of the house but here , it's the threat of the guillotine if Tom doesn't make sure the " mouseketeers " don't keep quiet so the house-owner can go back to sleep . Whenever Jerry hears threats like that directed toward Tom , he does his best to make sure he gets the cat in trouble by doing what Tom's not supposed to do ( and one wonders why I and others root for Tom in these cartoons ! ) . Jerry has his little gray French mouse friend " Tuffy " with him so the two of them try to make as much noise as possible . We see some repeat sight gags such as Tom balancing a half dozen dishes on his paws to keep dishes from breaking , etc . Even though some of the cartoon is also a direct rehash from others as the early gags are very similar , there were enough original gags - and good ones - to still make this fun to watch . Tom provides the humor as he has to be on his toes , literally . The artwork in here is excellent and CinemaScope a good format to show it off . The colors are brilliant . One scene has the magnificent castle on the left and rolling purple hills in the background of lush yellow / green grass and wheat in the center and right . It's just beautiful .
526974	4445210	44313	8.0	' Great Horny Toadies ! '	This is one of those Bugs Bunny versus Yosemite Sam cartoons except Sam , in this story , is called " Chilacott Sam . " However , it's the same loud-and-obnoxious two-gun sawed-off , red-haired and greedy " varmint . " In this cartoon , he's a " claim jumper , " a guy trying to steal other's gold discoveries up in Alaska . By the way , there is some beautiful artwork in here with all the mountain scenery . When he finds out Bugs has a green thumb-type magic touch for finding gold , Sam follows him and offers to be his partner . " All you have to do , " says Sam , " is find all the gold and I'll share it with you 50-50 . " " Honest and for true ? " responds Bug sarcastically while giving us - the audience - a look . " Well , what are we waiting for ? There's gold in them thar hills . " One of Bugs Bunny's favorite things had to be making an idiot of those who think they are putting something over on him . He likes to play dumb and then totally ruin the person . He's very sadistic at times and very funny ! I loved some of Sam's exclamations in here , such as the one you see in the subject head here . It was just one of many Sam used in this cartoon .
523850	4445210	1154361	8.0	From Tasers To Eeels : Shocking Stuff !	Things that literally shock us are the topic in this edition of " Marvel Marvels . " Topics include the Taser gun , lightning , power lines , the electric chair , electrified fences , the " third rail , " Etc / defibrillators and electric eels . " Thomas A . Swift's Electric Rifle " became TASER , a gun that was invented almost 50 years ago but needed further work to perfect it . Now , Rick Swift and his Taser International have done just that , give us painful demonstrations and explanations on how it works . It's proved to have saved many lives . This opening segment might have been the most interesting of all the topics . The lightning section mostly dealt with how airplanes are made to safely protect themselves from lightning . As for power lines , we learned how 90 percent of the outdoor lines still are not insulated and how dangerous they can be . As far as the electric chair , it's rarely used anymore , its days long gone . In its history , only one man survived it , and that's because an operator of the chair messed up ( and was fired ) . The electrical fence , however , as installed in high-security prisons is doing well . . . . . so well that no inmates anywhere have even attempted to get past it . Touch it once , and you're dead . The rest of the topics were pretty boring except for the creepy electric eel , which is amazing creature . This fish has many interesting facets to it .
527453	4445210	112857	9.0	A Different Shade Of Film Noir	This is the kind of film that can stay with you for awhile after you watch it : a haunting kind of film that isn't always pleasant or easy to understand but you remember it . It also helps to have a fondness for the 1940 film noir movies . It doesn't help that it appears racist in nature with people of one color all being the bad guys while people with another color all the good guys . I won't say which is which , but if the colors were reversed , there would have been an outcry about the obvious bias here by screenwriter-director Carl Franklin . Despite this , it's still a fascinating movie that just oozes with the 1940s atmosphere . Great narration in there , a la film noir , great automobiles and great sets . It puts you right into the late 40s in Los Angeles , a little bit like the film Chinatown . Denzel Washington does a nice job with the narration and the lead role , the character of " Easy Rawlins , " off the book by Walter Moseley ( which I read and recommend ) . Tom Sizemore and Don Cheadle play very intense characters in supporting roles , particularly Cheadle as the trigger-happy " Mouse . " Jennifer Beals is alluring as the mysterious " Daphne Monet . " The film is a bit confusing in parts and was especially so for me since the book was not exactly the same and had a totally different ending . Nonetheless , the film has always fascinated me and drawn me back for multiple viewings . It's good storytelling and it would be fun to see more of Moseley's books translated to the big screen .
522310	4445210	113133	9.0	Fascinating Quirky Film	Here is one more somewhat-unknown film I wish got more notice , although I'm not sure how many would like it because it's so different . It's a bizarre combination of humor and tragedy , of supernatural and straight drama . It's just an odd mix , but I find it very , very interesting and I've seen it three times , equally fascinated each time . The movie goes back and forth between drama and comedy which makes unsettling for some viewers , but not me . It kept me on my toes , so to speak , even with those multiple viewings . Also in here is another example of how good comedians can be in dramatic roles , in this case , veteran comic Jerry Lewis . Oliver Platt plays his son , and does an outstanding job as the main figure in this film . The comedy is really provided by others , most notably the most tragic figure in the film : " Jack Parker , " effectively played by Lee Evans . There is really is no way to adequately explain this strange film in a few paragraphs . I would just say if you are looking for something different , give this a try . And stay with it , even if the first half hour is not to your liking . You will be rewarded .
523035	4445210	60934	9.0	Strong Epic Film Which Got Shafted At Oscar Night	What a powerful story ! It's hard to believe this epic movie - three hours in length - was nominated for eight Academy Awards and came away with nothing . It seems unjust . Well , not everything is " just " in this dramatic story , either . Good people die , bad people live . Incredible joy and sorrow are but a few minutes away . The story is well-told and thus keeps your attention , is well-acted and is nicely - filmed . My only complaint was the last 13 minutes when the film got a little too political and , of course , tilted to the Left as films tend to do . Otherwise , I throughly enjoyed the experience of watching this long movie , and sorry I didn't watch this years ago . Well , better late than never , is all I can say . This movie is worthy of any serious film collector's attention . Robert Wise directed and he did a fabulous job . I just love some of the shots and camera angles in this widescreen production , which was done justice in a recently - - released two - disc DVD . The cinematography was by Joseph MacDonald . I'm sorry he didn't win an Oscar . The story has something for everyone : several action scenes , two romances , a little humor , some flag waving and flag disparaging , and a lot of drama and intrigue . I also found two interesting character studies : " Jake Holman , " by lead actor Steve McQueen , and " Captain Collins - , " with Richard Crenna . Both men delivered numerous surprises . There also is a lot of hostility by the Chinese toward the " invaders , " the Americans . China's revolution during the period this story takes place ( md ' 20s ) had two factions : the Nationalists , led by Chiang Kai-shek , and the Communists . The former was generally a peaceful organization , the latter , pretty violent . Neither one wanted outsiders running their country any longer . The cast - well-known and not-so well - - known , was solid from McQueen on down . I think it was odd to hear Richard Attenborugh with an American accent but he did a nice job with it . Crenna played the most interesting character , in my opinion , as captain hard to figure . As for the supporting actors , Simon Oakland ( " Stawski " ) and Mako ( " Po-han " ) stood out to me . I'm not going get into the story , as enough reviewers have already done that . Photograhy-wise , it was nice to see most of this shot outdoors , not on some studio lot or sound-stage . I enjoyed all of the shots of the ship , the " San Pablo . " The new DVD sports an outstanding transfer . Audiby , i's advertised as 4 . 0 sound but there is no rear speaker audio in here , so 3 . 0 would be more accurate . Overall , a memorable story and highly-recommended .

Miss Oyl is made to imitate a chicken by the hypnotist , our old buddy Bluto , who is " The Great Hypnotist " in this episode . When Popeye's had enough , he jumps on stage and the cartoon really gets wild after that with both guys making total fools of the other . . . . and the packed audience loving every minute . This was a humorous Popeye , entertaining all the way .

" Yup , he's here and just hearing that name makes you figure this is going to be a funny Tom and Jerry episode . . . and it is . " Muscles " is a relative of Jerry's and gets the call when Tom is being unusually nasty to the mouse we all know . Muscles , a tough guy with a bowler hat , lives elsewhere and is so tough he beats up all the alley cats and is feared by them all . Once he arrives at Tom and Jerry's place he wastes no time with our famous cat . He tells him plain as can be to stop messing with Jerry . . . . or else . Tom realizes he's in for a battle and immediately begins to train with weights to build up his muscles . The battle is on . Need I remotely suggest who wins ? Regardless of winners and losers , this was a very entertaining cartoon and actually not as violent as I've seen in many other T & J cartoons . The storyline is just that , but I thought the comedy routines , just as Tom literally turning into ten bowling pins and then back into a cat , were emphasized more than anything .
523137	4445210	43480	9.0	It's Enough To Drive An Irish Dog To Drink	This is different in that we get two Droopy dogs : he and his twin brother " Drippy . " In this story , Droopy is working for a butler in a big mansion and the butler is going to be away for a few days . He needs a replacement and Droopy gets Drippy to handle the chores . Drippy sounds like Droopy but is a lot more physical . You can tell by the little derby on his head which tough guys apparently used to wear in the 30s and 40s . You can also tell when Drippy enters the mansion by punching holes through the door ! No stranger is allowed in the house is the rule number one , Drippy is told . Guess who wants to hide in the house for a few days ? Yup , our old friend " Spike . " My favorite bad guy-bulldog also has a derby and speaks with an Irish accent in this cartoon ! He made me laugh just listening to him . He's always funny as it is but an Irish brogue , he's really good ! Spike's first plan is to hoodwink Drippy into giving him food . He gets his answer quickly , belted a few hundred yards with Drippy's only remark being " no strangers . " The gag for most of the cartoon is Drippy doing his job of making sure there are " no strangers " while Droopy being a nice guy and trying to help the big dog . All the time , the poor bulldog has no idea Droopy has that slugger for a twin brother . All he knows is that one minute everything is good , the next minute he's getting clobbered . Whatever . . . . . it's funny material and I actually felt sorry for poor , clueless Spike who takes some brutal ( but laugh - out-loud ) beatings ! p . s . His double-take at the end of the cartoon is one of the best I've seen .
522251	4445210	956034	9.0	This Show Had Several Very Interesting Aspects	Stories involving the dismantling of a bomb with lives in danger are always riveting . I have yet to see one that wasn't , and this episode is no exception . It was neat to see how " Hector " traded places with a guy who couldn't move a muscle or he would set the bomb . ( I am not giving anything away because now poor Hector is now on the spot ! ) . Also , there are tense scenes with Col . Ryan escorting a dignitary down a blown-out elevator shaft , and well as other tense moments . All of this takes place at the United Nations . In a secondary story , Molly and Tiffany are in Vietnam trying to see if they can find a long - lost MIA . A woman they knew back home received an offer that , for $5 , 000 , her son would be located . In the third story , the immoral Crystal , who looks and talks like a 14-year-old comes over to Mack's house since Tiffany is out of the country and he wants to have nothing to do with her . I guess he got a change of conscience after banging her in the car the previous night in this TV show which turned into the semi soap opera the past month . The Vietnam story turned out to be very interesting , and another case of a very selfish person . The UN mayhem turned out to be revenge over a long-ago car accident which killed a man's son , so it wasn't anything something political . Overall , even with the " soap " story inserted with the irritating Cyrstal , is was a very entertaining episode .
526637	4445210	167842	9.0	Entertaining ' Anthology ' Of Clapton	These are videos of the hits of both Eric Clapton and some of the early bands he was in such as " The Yardbirds " and " Cream . " It guess you could call this an " anthology " as it shows the famous guitarist-singer from the early ' 60s through the ' 80s when this tape was made . Whatever the era , it's simply good rock ' n roll music . Most tunes , even the very early stuff in which I didn't recognize the ultra-young , thin and beardless Clapton , are still good to hear and his guitar work has always been a pleasure . With each video , Clapton's appearance really changes . When the video switches to color and to stereo , it really picks up steam . " Layla , " " Cocaine , " " Forever Man , " and a " Tearing Us Apart " were the highlights for me . The latter was a duet with Tina Turner . " Layla " is uniquely done in that they mix several concert tapings into the song , but keep it cohesive . The last two songs aren't much so I end it with that duet with Turner . It makes the video end on a high note .
524869	4445210	87332	9.0	Still Very Funny & Entertaining	There is no set definition of the word " classic " but I'm sure this film qualifies as such or will in the near future , since it was so unique and popular . . . . and remains so today , over 20 years old later . It's just one of those films that you remember seeing when it came out at the theaters . I doubt if anyone has forgotten the catchy theme song , either . Despite numerous viewings , I still find this very funny as I suspect many people do , because it entertains so well . I know the story is ludicrous and I don't believe for one second in ghosts so I ignore the " theology " and just laugh at Bill Murray , Dan Ackroyd , Harold Ramis , Rick Moranis , Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson . Murray , as he tends to do , grabs the spotlight more than the rest and delivers more laughs than any of the cast but my favorite was Moranis as the nerdy " Louis Tully . " I wish his role had been bigger . All the guys , however , plus Sigourney Weaver , the love interest of the always-horny Murray , are fun . I even liked the sequel because most of this cast was included .
527122	4445210	78748	9.0	A Ground-Breaker In Sci-Fi / Horror	Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy , but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years . It's just too interesting to ignore . The attractions are the incredible suspense ; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes . They didn't overdo the action scenes , either , as is so often the case with modern-day films . In fact , some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience . The suspense , as crew members search for the killer alien , is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast , all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life . I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright , who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen , met her demise . The rest of the crew wasn't much classier . Since this movie came out , in fact , the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous . Anyway , Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it . Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest ? That's a scene that stays with you forever . Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene , but never quite been as successful . The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance . It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott . This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat .
522391	4445210	25688	9.0	' Pop " Goes Curly !	This very early Three Stooges effort starts off differently than almost all their others in that the three don't know each other . Moe is a fight manager looking for boxer ; Curly is a waiter and Larry a violinist . They all meet at this restaurant and when Larry starts playing " Pop Goes The Weasel , " Curly goes nuts and punches everyone's lights out . Moe hires the two so he can get back into the fight game . One day during some roadside training , they meet up with a pretty dame whose car is stuck in the mud . By playing the " Weasel " song , Curly lifts the car and solves the problem . She drives off as he jumps in the back seat ! The next scenes show newspaper headlines as " K . O . Stradivarius " ( our hero Curly ) beats all opponents and is now scheduled to fight for the championship . The last bout is something to see : probably the goofiest fight scenes I've ever seen on film , which includes the great silent comics . Larry Howard ( " Curly " ) was an underrated comic genius and shows it here early on in his career . It's the subtle things he does in this fight that had me laughing out loud .
526767	4445210	43137	9.0	One Of The Better Westerns Of That Era	I was very impressed with this film . I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns . I say that for the whole thing : the acting , mature dialog , no - nonsense story and excellent cinematography . Director Anthony Mann , who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era , also made some westerns such as this one . It has that same film-noir look . Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period . . If you like this movie , I recommend the Mann-Stewart film " Bend Of The River . " In a nutshell , the story is about a man , " Lin McAdam , " ( Stewart ) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle , a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest . It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain . All of those villains are interesting characters . Aiding Stewart act out this interesting tale are Shelley Winters , Dan Duryea , Stephen McNally , Millard Mitchell , Charles Drake , Will Greer and J . C . Flippen . All of them are fun to watch . It was a bit of a stretch , however , to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ( " Young Bull " ) , but you can't have everything .
527125	4445210	78346	9.0	Superman Takes Off On The Big Screen	It's interesting that another re-make is coming out this year . Man , time flies because I vividly remember when this movie came out and the excitement it caused . This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects , so it was pretty cool , to say the least . It's still very entertaining , and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain ( Gene Hackman as " Lex Luthor " ) and the lines he delivers . He's a funny guy . Christopher Reeve , meanwhile , was always a popular " Man Of Steel " and the special effects are still fun to watch , from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits . There's a solid soundtrack to this , too . Personally , I didn't care for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again , Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying , too . I guess it comes with her character . However , being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence ( it's now on DVD , by the way , and worth a purchase ) , it was just too weird hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were ! Anyway , this is simply great entertainment . As a superhero , Superman has always been THE MAN . Three sequels followed this film , the second one being the best in my opinion .
526547	4445210	26102	9.0	A Unique Popeye Cartoon In Several Areas	This Popeye cartoon is unusual in that Bluto not only doesn't know Olive Oyl but insults her when he first sees her , calling her a " long-legged scarecrow ! " In addition , he tells her to mind her own business . This Bluto is a mean guy , a guy who is mistreating the horse that is pulling he and an over-sized load of produce . The horse is ready to drop but Bluto won't even let the animal get a drink of water , taking a nearby tub of water and drinking it all himself and then constantly whipping the horse and punching him in the face ! Wow , this sort of thing wouldn't be shown today , even in jest . This guy is worse than Michael Vick with dogs ! After insulting Olive , Popeye confronts the big lug when he himself gets whipped . Bluto then throws a big bunch of bananas and hits Olive in the head . Wow , this is really different from the norm . In a way , I kind of liked it as Olive could be a pain . Animal lovers will really enjoy the " justice " at the end of this cartoon ! Note : This was not the voice I have ever heard doing Popeye . It sounded weird . I looked it up here and it's Floyd Buckley , who only voiced one Popeye cartoon - this one .
526548	4445210	26111	9.0	A Popeye ' Opera ' With A Satisfying Ending	This was another different type of Popeye cartoon that one only saw in the beginning years of Popeye , in which a song sometimes opened the story , like a Betty Boop cartoon . Here , Popeye and Olive sing about " Barnacle Bill The Sailor . " Olive tells Popeye she can't marry him because she's in love with Barnacle Bill , so both sing different lyrics , depending on how they feel about " Bill . " In later Popeye cartoons , our sailor wouldn't be singing upon hearing bad news like that . He'd get sad , depressed or violent , but he wouldn't sing about it . Nonetheless , you know Popeye isn't going to take this lying down ; he never does despite Olive being the most fickle woman in the history of the big screen . A good portion of this is almost like an opera , sung to that " Barnacle Bil " tune , but it's a catchy song and has fun lyrics , depending on who's singing it . Bluto chimes in with his version . Like the other reviewers here , I enjoyed listening to it . The ending is terrific , one of the best I've seen mainly because that fickle woman gets what she deserves !
524499	4445210	113419	9.0	' Omri " One Of The Most Likable Kids Ever On Film	I'm a sucker for nice kids , not those snotty ones seen so often in films from the ' 60s to the present . In here is a wonderful neat-looking little kid , Hal Sardino , who is unusual in that this is the only movie he ever starred in . To his credit , Scardino went on to live a " normal " life after this film , eventually going to college as a regular student like you and me with no celebrity status . The film is anything but " normal , " a fantasy about a young boy who receives a cupboard that transforms little toy figurines - in this case , an Indian and then a cowboy . - into miniature real-life people . Each time he opens or closes the box with the figures in them , they change to either real or back to plastic . Scardino , who plays Omri , " is fun to watch , if for no other reason than the great expressions on his face . He has to be one of the most likable children I've ever seen on film . Meanwhile , his best friend " Patrick " is the only villain , so to speak , only because he's a bit " defiant , " as his mother labels him and he almost spoils everything for " Omri . " It's a solid family film that is fun for both the parents and kids to watch at the same time . Both will get a lot of entertainment out of it . With just a bit of profanity early on and a bit of obvious political correctness , there is nothing in here which should offend viewers . Critics didn't seem to care for it , so you know it truly was a nice , wholesome film . . . . and fun to watch .
526539	4445210	71562	9.0	Not Far Behind The First Film	This isn't quite as powerful as the first Godfather , done two years earlier , but it isn't far behind . It's another magnificently filmed effort , wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you've put it in your tape or DVD player . What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks . Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan . He was shown in a flashback scene near the end , and that was it . One thing was just as good if not better than the first film , and that was the cinematography . The browns , blacks , greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes . I especially love the Italian houses and scenery . Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling . The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael ( Al Pacino ) . It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth . There are some excellent supporting performances in this film , too . I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg .
525567	4445210	311519	9.0	Unique & Fun , Start-To-Finnish	I've watched this twice now , and throughly enjoyed both viewings , finding this film to really be a unique one . It's a Finnish film , which is unusual to start with , at least here in the U . S . because we don't see too many films from Finland . It's a black comedy , meaning deadpan looks with subtle comedic lines . In English , it's titled " The Man Without A Past . " The main actor , Markuu Peltola , is perfect for this movie with one of the most deadpan faces you'll ever see . He is amazing to watch and Kati Outinen , as his love interest , is similarly strange and fascinating . Part of their charm are their unusual looks . This is not a romance between people who look like your normal handsome film stars . Simply , this is just something very different from anything you've seen , a combination of drama , comedy and romance with some of the strangest dialog I've ever heard on film . If you appreciate dry humor and a bizarre but touching story , you should see this .
526537	4445210	71315	9.0	A Bit Confusing But Always Fascinating	No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already . I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on . It's not an easy to story to follow . It's also unusual : a crime story dealing with rights to water . To many people , that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California . There is nothing confusing about how this film looks . It's a treat for one's eyes , especially if you love that 1940s look , which I do . This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere : a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail . What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing : a man's nose getting sliced . Here , it's Jack Nicholson getting a " nose job " courtesy of some thugs . Jack , playing " Jake Gittes , " will forever be known ( among wild roles ) as the guy with a bandage on his nose , thanks to this movie . As interesting as he is , along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast , I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here . I love the way he sounds and acts , and I'm sorry he had such a short role . Overall , an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it .
524671	4445210	44625	9.0	One Of The Wildest , Action-Packed Tom and Jerry Cartoons	Whether this was a rip-off of the Tweety-and-Sylvester ' toon called " Kitty Foiled " or not was immaterial to me once I watched this because this was outstanding . ( So was " Kitty Foiled . " ) The sight-gags , pratfalls , slapstick nonsense , etc . , were almost all very clever in this short as Tom tries one thing after another to either get the canary or Jerry . It's mayhem , with one catastrophe after another happening the hapless cat . Is imitation of a flying bat is pretty wild . Actually , it's almost too much action . After awhile , you want to say : " stop ! slow down for a second ! " Overall , however , it entertains nicely and provides a lot of laughs , which is the idea . The artwork in here is pretty good , too .
522981	4445210	94862	9.0	The Original ' ' Chucky ' ' Still The Best	This is a truly interesting horror flick that was so popular that sequels have been coming out ever since , none of course matching this one : the original . The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off once " Chucky " comes to life . It almost takes half the movie for that to happen . It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention . The only change I would have made was to the end the movie five minutes earlier , but they tacked on something that wasn't needed . The doll's owner " Andy , " ( Alex Vincent ) is a cute little kid and Alex does a decent job of acting while Catherine Hicks is fine as his mom . A familiar face in the ' 80s , Chris Sarandon , adds his talents as a detective . Instead of all the stupid sequels , I would have preferred to see a remake done , now that special-effects have made such great advances . For instance , at least with the VHS I have , Chuckie's lips aren't even in sync with the dialog ! He walks a little too wooden-like but the other special-effects were just fine . Nothing is to be taken seriously , anyway . It's just a silly voodoo-type story ( you should hear the explanation of who " Chuckie " is ) and just played for a scary horror film . On that level , it works because it IS scary .
523091	4445210	372784	10.0	Outstanding Batman ' Prequel '	This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people . . . . but not me . I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence , didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story , and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman . The first hour of this " prequel " dealt with his origins . If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films , this part in the film should not bore you . It was like a documentary to me , about a topic I was interested in . In fact , on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more . Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman . It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role , ruining the continuity of this latest series . I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character . It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of " Alfred . " He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story . Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role , or romantic one , as I expected , and that was fine with me . I just enjoyed looking at her face , leaving it go at that . Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes ( but , once again , played by another actor . ) The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman , featuring " The Joker . " After having seen all the Batman films several times , I now think is the best of them all . . . . perhaps an unpopular choice , but that's my opinion . Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie . You might be missing the best of the Batmans !
522816	4445210	60907	10.0	Ya Gotta Love This Dog !	The is an excellent Pink Panther cartoon , definitely in the top echelon . Even though it was frustrating at times , as this poor innocent dog kept getting blamed for things the Pink Panther did , justice prevailed in the end . Along the route , it's simply a story of the Panther exacting revenge for the Little White Guy interrupting his sleep out in the park . The PP is way up in the branches trying to sleep with the man and his dog set up camp below . Soon , the man is in his hammock snoring away . The snoring interrupts the Panther's sleep and the cartoon from that point is a series of events in which he gets back at the guy for his snoring . How the dog gets involved is the funny part of each skit in this cartoon . He's the star of the animated short . You'll just love this dog !
522971	4445210	351283	10.0	Lived Up To Good Reputation - Funny , Colorful	Here's another recently-made animated film that has two outstanding characteristics which make it a winner : 1 - consistently funny humor that adults can enjoy , and 2 - beautiful , bold colors . When a movie is both fun to hear and to watch , I have very few complaints . This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids . I can't say that for sure , since I watched it by myself . . . . but I sure got my share of laughs This is a tale of four zoo animals that wind up in the wilds . To be more precise , they go from the big zoo in New York City to the wilds of Madagascar , an island near Africa . Wherever these " guys " are - the lion , zebra , hippo and giraffe - they are entertaining . Ben Stiller and Chris Rock , voicing the lion ( " Alex " ) and zebra ( " Marty " ) , respectively , are the two main characters . Jada Pinkett Smith's hippo ( " Gloria " ) and and David Schwimmer's hypochondriac giraffe ( " Melman " ) provide solid support . The main thing is that all the characters , including supporting ones , are likable and funny in their own way . Every character is quite different . The story movies exceptionally fast so the hour-and-a-half is easy to watch . Maybe the best thing I can say is that I heard a lot of good things about this before watching it , and it lived up to its hype . That's not easy to do .
525774	4445210	26109	10.0	Grampy Is A Hoot !	Betty gets a telegram from Grampy to come over to his house " for a little party " and " come right over and bring the gang , " he adds . " Ohh , " she shrieks , and puts on her hat and heads right over . As she is singing about " Gramy's house " while strutting down the street , she is joined by people who overhear her lyrics and tag along . They literally drop everything ( i . e . piano ) and follow her . The rest of the cartoon shows the amazing inventions in Grampy's house and , believe me , they are a hoot to see and hear ( such as the clever way he produces music for the party . ) This is great stuff - a " feel-good " cartoon , if I ever saw one .
524494	4445210	113497	10.0	Maybe The Best Ever For Just Pure Entertainment	Among the thousands of films I have viewed , this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment . That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects , etc . etc . But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun . The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day , but now about 10 years later , it's no big deal . In fact , some of it , such as the lion , look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now . To me , it was story that was the lure , anyway , not the special effects . Because it's so much fun , this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed . The time flies by . It's not to be analyzed or given much thought , because it's so ludicrous . You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way . That's one of the big attractions of this of film : the excellent combination of adventure and comedy . Are there annoying things in this movie ? Sure . To me , it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter ( Jonathan Hyde ) . Other than that , I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward . I've probably viewed this movie as much as any , simply because it was so entertaining . Robin Williams , David Alan Grier and the two kids , Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce , were all great people to watch and share this adventure with . Now THIS is entertainment !
523463	4445210	781636	10.0	An Intense , Emotional Story	Mac is sitting in his office when he gets a call . The caller states he committed a murder awhile ago and stashed the body in the north end zone at Giants Stadium . He can't get that memory of the victim's screams out of his head and needed to confess . He hangs up and puts a gun to his head and kills himself . Wow , what an attention-getter to start this episode . Mac goes to East Rutherford , N . J . , and with cooperation from the police and CSI there , finds , indeed a skeleton buried deep in the end zone . The big story here is that Danny Messer of the CSI team is implicated in this murder and Mac must find a way to clear his name . This is a very intense story with an emotional ending . A second story as Danny and Stella checking out a murder of a bank CEO , found dead in a hotel room , apparently stabbed to death . There is a message on the bathroom mirror making this look like " a crime of passion . " This is a very seedy story and took away from the first one , which should have been the focus of the entire episode .
523853	4445210	482571	10.0	Just As Intriguing The Second Time , Too !	I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times , even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour . Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things , because earlier scenes take on new meaning . It's not an easy film to totally digest , even with two viewings , because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations . Without having to resort to spoilers , let me just say the story is extremely interesting , the acting very good , the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it , too , without language or sex concerns . Basically , it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century . They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way . Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles , as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles . This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over !
524440	4445210	36775	10.0	Justifiably At The Top Of Most Film Noir Lists	This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well . I am still waiting for a DVD to come out that will give this film the treatment it deserves . Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining . . . . . at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray . I think it's a big appeal to this movie , except to younger folks who look at it as " cheesy . " I read the book , Double Indemnity written by James Cain , and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it . This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book . That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay , For a murder / suspense story , there is very little action , almost none , yet there are no boring lulls . The three main actors - Stanwyck , MacMurray and Edward G . Robinson , are what make this so good . MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback , from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson . The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance , the way he delivers his lines . He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen . Stanwyck was no sex symbol ( at least to me ) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and , like Robinson , has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention . This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie , " Body Heat , " starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner . That , too , was a very , very good movie . . . . but not many films are in the class of this one .
