490043	33913	123366	1.0	Just Awful ! Mail Rosie a mussel to shut her big mouth !	Believe it or not , I watched this show in the beginning in 1996 and I was a fan of it then . Not anymore , I grew to lose respect for all of the co-hosts at one time or another . Never did I think that Meredith Viera would announce to the world that she is not wearing underwear . Debbie Matenopoulos was far better than her replacements despite her sometimes idiotic comments . Until yesterday when Star Jones Reynolds announced her departure from the show did it hit me , I can't stand Rosie O'Donnell to begin with because she is a lying hypocrite of a human being and for her to succeed Viera's departure only supports my decision to have stopped watching . Who wants to see Rosie O'Donnell again as a talk show host anyway ? That was what was behind Star's departure was the Rosie's arrival . Not that Star is herself blameless , she has changed a lot since her surgery and her marriage but she managed to maintain some of my respect . After all , she is a lawyer and I don't think she's no dummy . Barbara Walters , what have you done to this show since it first aired 9 years ago . I could see why Meredith is leaving for better opportunities . I can't stand Joy Behar anymore who I used to enjoy watching as a comedian . I had respect for Star Jones until this show and watched it deplete over the years . Debbie's replacements have never had the same magic as the show once did when it premiered and even less when Rosie joins the show . With Star , I wish her and Meredith the best . But come on , Barbara , you can go outside and get somebody off the streets of New York City who doesn't talk English and do a better job then Rosie . They could be homeless , drunk , and wasted and I bet they would be funnier and more original than Rosie O'Donnell could ever be . I was reading that you were going to ask Marcia Cross about those lesbian rumors in front of her parents even though she was engaged to a man at the time but Marcia's quite a lady but you lost her respect . How many other people's respect are you going to lose now . Maybe Barbara should retire herself . Now if Barbara was smart , she would have gotten Kathie Lee Gifford to take over Meredith's spot . I plan on watching something less argumentative , maybe I'll switch over to Jerry Springer from now on .
490338	33913	461721	2.0	Sorry , this isn't it , Seth ?	I love Seth Green . His appearances on THat 70s ' Show is always worth watching but last night , I felt the show needed to overhauled . Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for . The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place . So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out . Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable . I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up . There did not seem to be much humor in it . I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night . I think they should go back , scrap this series , and start over . We need more family involved series . How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down . THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook , play the mother and dysfunctional siblings . The list of possibilities with somebody like Seth Green are endless and the network is blowing it .
490474	33913	95687	3.0	one of the worst movies ever made	My Stepmother is an Alien has to be one of the worst movies ever made in the eighties . Alyson Hannigan makes her film debut . Now she's a lesbian witch on Bffy : The Vampire Slaver , this movie is dreadful with a fine cast of actors like Saturday Night Live's Jon Lovitz , Dan Ackroyd , and the beautiful Kim Basinger as the title character . It is almost unbearable to watch it now . I have seen on TV and I thought it was much better than on video . I'm sorry I bought the videotape . Now , I want my money back because it's just horribly written maybe that was it's true intent but the film never really becomes worth watching even for the humorous moments . I'm glad that the cast has long moved away from this film's history . Basinger is now an Oscar winner and Golden Globe winner for her performance in L . A . Confidential . Hannigan has become a regular television actress in comedies now . Jon and Dan have gone on to do much more .
490132	33913	385890	3.0	A Big Fat Mess of Epic Portions !	Okay , I wanted to like this movie because I love spoofs and satiric films but this movie was way over the top . It was a combination of Pulp Fiction , A Big Fat Greek Wedding , and other films but the script lacked sense and the cast of characters were nobody familiar . I applaud first time directors who try to be innovative but the film needs some type of structure and I hope that they keep trying to spoof films whether classic or sensational . You can spoof so much more like Titanic and other popular forms of film . There is so much but you can't do it all in one film . First , the casting should have been better . The location shooting was fine but like again the film kept shoving popular film spoofs in our face . Most of us haven't seen all the films that they are spoofing .
490491	33913	56758	5.0	Butcher Jill Farren Phelps does it again !	After Santa Barbara , Guiding Light , Another World , and One Life to Live , the Soap Butcher Jill Farren Phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows . When I was watching Guiding Light , it was at its peak in 1991 . They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps . She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death . She killed off beloved Ellen Parker's character Maureen . So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience . On Another World , she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell's beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline . On One Life to Live , I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover . Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role . I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow . The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely . She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death . Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones . Why aren't the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick ? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps . I know Monty's heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn't successful as the Luke & Laura days but still , I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps . Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people . I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps ' known favoritism for certain actors . I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair . But I know after 25 years of watching soaps , I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew . I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me . I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans . Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation ! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat . Remember Another World ! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live . What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen . Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children . Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years . I'm concerned that she is going to lose one of the show's best attributes , the Quartermaine Family . She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute . Even with John Ingle's welcome return , the shadow over the show is still different . I don't blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon's departure . It's as shocking as it comes . This is what you get when you have somebody like Phelps at the helm .
490409	33913	184858	5.0	a mixed bag of goods !	This film is not one of the director's finest works despite it's all star cast with enough twists and turns for a roller coaster ride at an amusement park . Ben Affleck plays an ex-convict whose cell mate gets killed in a prison fight . Ben's character , Rudy , meets up with Ashley played by Charlize Theron . Just remember , nobody is truly what they appear to be in this film . Ashley's brother , Gabriel , is played by the under-rated Gary Sinise who is far more deadly than any of Rudy's prison pals . First , they think Rudy is truly Nick Cassidy , a former casino worker . The mixed-up identity allows Rudy to spend some quality time with Ashley . By the time of revelations , nobody is truly what they seem to be and relationships are revealed that are not always proper . I think Rudy / Nick learns the truth about Ashley's life . By the end of the film , you're actually cheering for Rudy because he turns out to be the hero but I won't say how he does it or what happens . I don't want to spoil the film's ending .
490194	33913	441774	5.0	A mixture of truth and fiction !	Okay if you know the true story about Martha Beck and Raymond Martinez Fernandez , you would know that Martha Beck was an overweight nurse , single mother of two children that she abandoned . The casting of Selma Hayek is fine but they make no attempt in allowing her to be Martha Beck . She is too glamorized in this role . I have no problem with Jared Leto in the role of Raymond . Of course , my biggest problem with the film is the concentration on the cops played by John Travolta and James Gandolfini . While the costume designs , acting , and directing are first rate , the writers and director does take artistic liberties . I actually felt bad for the characters of Beck and Fernandez even though their main motives was to profit from the dead of unsuspecting women like Janet Fay who was actually 66 years old but played by a much younger actress . I felt that the film is worth watching but it's painful to watch at times .
490853	33913	117350	5.0	Not that Bad !	I gave it a try a second time . Years had passed since I first bought the tape , look , it's a spoof of Pulp Fiction , Reservoir Dogs , Forrest Gump , and other films . It's not supposed to be serious , it's supposed to stupid . I thought the nuns were funny trying to rob a bank . Sandra Bernhard plays the Amanda Plummer role from Pulp Fiction . Dan Castellanata plays the Forrest Gump character in this film . I love Julie Brown and I don't understand why she does not have a hit sitcom or is working as much as she is . Everybody remembers her from Just Say Julie show on MTV don't they , she's the funniest woman in Hollywood as we speak . Her role as Mimi Hungry is unforgettable . First , the movie is not meant to be taken seriously . It just wants to spoof Tarantino films and Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers . Okay , it's not masterpiece theater but you can watch it .
490398	33913	640587	6.0	Get Mama in Shape !	When Mama Harper enters an arm wrestling contest as the Bigger Jigger , she wins against a biker-type tattooed man . She wins the contest after tricking him and gaining his sympathy . The next contest is when she has to go arm wrestle somebody of her age and weight for fairness . The family and Iola does their best to get her in shape for the event which is far the funniest part of the episode . When the biker man brings his equally tough Mama played by Kathleen Freeman who does a fantastic job in the role , Mama goes arm to arm until she learns that her son and daughter-in-law have bet their life savings over the contest which means they will have to stay forever with Mama Harper .
490450	33913	640540	6.0	Mama and the Baby !	Vint and Naomi dream of having a baby of their own but when it doesn't happen . They consider adoption which is where Mama Harper comes in as the primary caretaker . That's all Mama wants another face to wash and clean and feed in her house . The adoption agency wants to interview Mothe Harper with a psychiatrist which does not go considerably well at all for Vint and Naomi but still it's funny and humorous to watch Mama Harper with a psychiatrist being so defensive for the way that she raised all her children including Vint . I would have liked her to talk about her other daughters , Ellen , and Eunice but that's okay . Mama can make fur fly in the room with her sassy humor and sharp-tongued wit . I'll never understand why Vicki Lawrence didn't get an Emmy for this role and I never will .
489788	33913	221768	6.0	Not so Perfect Movie !	I read the book and of course there must be a movie and in fact there was a mini-series for this book . I watched it and was a bit disappointed with it . I mean because we don't have a viable suspect even with John Mark Karr proclaiming his guilt and not being in the same state . He probably never met JonBenet Ramsey or knew about her existence until the tragic murder . I never thought the Ramseys were involve and they were finally clear after this film was made in 2003 . So it's not the couple and I always knew they were innocent of such a horrendous crime . Anyway it's Lou Smith who brings common sense when a bunch of silly police detectives pointing the wrong finger when they messed up the crime scene in the first place . Yes , the Ramseys are rich and hired attorneys to protect them . Of course , the beauty pageants was what Patsy and JonBenet loved to do together and I'm sure JonBenet would have been a beauty queen now if she was not gone . Anyway , the movie does try to be objective if possible . It's a shame that we don't know the truth even after almost 10 years , it's another dead end in the case with so many questions and few answers . We know that the Ramseys are innocent .
490504	33913	108889	7.0	It was a decent show !	I was at a phase where I was watching lots of shows filmed in Hawaii but I never got into lost because it supposed to represent another island or the jungle . Anyway , I liked Cheryl Ladd in this role and Richard Burgi who is better known to us as Carl , the former husband of Teri Hatcher's character Susan on Desperate Housewives . I liked the show for the scenery , story lines , and guest characters . I don't know why we don't utilize Hawaii's beauty to film television shows and movies . It was shown on Lifetime for awhile but it's gotten lost in the mix along the way . I still would love to go to Hawaii . I guess it's Paradise on earth and I would like to get there someday .
489742	33913	120824	7.0	It's alright but it's not complete !	Kevin Spacey gives a command performance as Quoyle , the man who fears the water . The movie is rather surprising with Cate Blanchett as almost unrecognizable as Petal , his former wife . Quoyle is rather a tragic and sad figure of a man . He loves his daughter and his former wife but he has his own demons to battle like a father who had killed his wife and himself . His father phones and leaves a message about not having to depend on welfare . We get to learn more about his father from Aunt Agnes Hamm played by Dame Judi Dench . Aunt Agnes is rather very new to Quoyle . He probably was not aware of her existence . Dame Judi really knows how to speak with a Newfoundland accent without much help . What we don't know about Aunt Agnes ' past , we soon learn the horrible truth and why she detests her brother and seeks revenge on his remains . The casting includes Julianne Moore , who perfected the Newfoundland accent , as a native resident and widow with a small child . Julianne and Kevin have chemistry . In fact , Kevin also becomes part of the community by working on the paper . Pete Postlethwaite ( Spielberg considers him to be one of his favorite actors / OBE recipient ) plays Spacey's boss or fellow employee . Lass Hallstrom did a wonderful job but there are things I have trouble with this film . I feel that I don't understand what actually happened and the resolution . The movie leaves you asking more questions than answers and you want to see more and even dream about someplace like Newfoundland .
490018	33913	640538	7.0	Out of Order Completely !	This episode was aired after Vint and Naomi's wedding . Regardless , Vint is divorced , broke , and living with Mama Harper and his old maid , Aunt Fran , and his two kids in the basement of their home . Vint's friend , Claude Cainmaker , hatches a plan . He's also the same man that helped get Vint lose his home and move back home with Mama . Some friend , huh ? He speaks with a Portugeuse man who wants his niece Zaida to get married so she can get a green card . Claude thinks of nothing better than asking Vint . When Vint goes home , he doesn't tell Mama about his upcoming nuptials . He soon realizes that he's been had by Claude when the plan goes awry thanks to Mama .
490313	33913	171433	7.0	Not Keeping the Faith !	Okay , the premise of this whole is about two men in love with the same woman . The only problem is that one man is a Catholic priest and the other is a Jewish Rabbi . I liked some moments in the film when Brian tries to explain why he is a priest and the whole celibacy vow that you have to take to become a Catholic Priest . It's like he's trying to rationalize why he doesn't have sex as his choice or vocation in life . Men don't become priests for the glory , the high income , or the power . Men who become priests do it as a service to their communities , their families , etc . Sorry but priests get a bad rap lately because of all the scandals and politics but the personal rewards are so much greater than money , power , or popularity . There are priests and rabbis who do so much services to their communities whether handling funerals , counseling distraught families , dealing with poverty , AIDS , homelessness , etc . that they don't have time to think about the celibacy vow . Maybe if we didn't live in this age where sex is counted , we could have lived in an age where deeds , services , contributions , and generosity counts . So , I'm not crazy about Jenna Elfman who is a Scientologist . Technically , Ben Stiller is Half-Jewish but his mother Anne Meara is Irish Catholic herself so technically he's not . Edward Norton is cast as Father Brian . The other cast members including the divine Anne Bancroft as Jake's mom is worth watching . The friendship between Jake , Brian , and Anna are enduring but the whole sexuality just messes it up for all of them . It might have been nicer to have just Jake and Brian's relationship despite their different religions which are not so much different . People are so fascinated with the whole celibacy that society practically dictates that if you're not getting any , there's something wrong with you . Maybe there is or maybe there is such a fuss about sex in the general , you wonder what's so great about it in the first place . Of course , love makes the world of difference after all .
490555	33913	68400	7.0	It should have been Sir Roddy McDowall !	It should have been Sir Roddy McDowall in my opinion . Why he never got knighted for his contributions to acting and drama , I will never know . This episode also feature Ida Lupino , another legendary actress , writer and director herself . Sir Roddy as I will call him plays a genius character who wants too much from his stepfather who played the evil Vice Presidential candidate in the original Manchurian Candidate . His plan is ingenious but there are exceptions being that Sir Roddy's character is still no match for Lieutenant COlumbo's genius . You have to laugh with him at the end of the film . Like most COlumbo episodes , you have to pay attention . We know who kills the character but how does Columbo catch him or her in some cases is just as fascinating as the episodes themselves .
490714	33913	824046	7.0	What happened to the kittens ?	Iola's beloved cat , Midnight , is sick . Naomi describes him as the meanest cat ever . He is so mean that Midnight attacks the postman . When Iola's cat dies , she gets him freeze-dried or preserved . The family decides to bet on one of the abandoned trunks at an auction sale . When Midnight is on the porch freeze-dried , Vint thinks he's killed him again so he buried him in the yard . Mama Harper knows that Midnight is already dead and makes the family get him out of the grave for Iola's sake . In the end , cats are all the rage but since the Harpers have adopted them . We never see them again and then there is the unopened trunk with so many possibilities about having a fortune .
490249	33913	69906	7.0	Could have been better !	Columbo's Most Dangerous Match is about chess . An unlikely subject or motive for murder in my opinion . The star is Manchurian Candidate's Lawrence Harvey who plays a deaf chess champion . He is terrified of losing and will do anything to maintain his status as world chess champion . His competitor is a Russian chess champion who unlike Lawrence Harvey's character is well-regarded and loved instead . He lures him into an unusual trap to prevent him from defeating . Columbo always knows how to work a prime suspect and does it by being fascinated in their work particularly chess . One of Columbo's trademarks is that he gets interested in the character's passion and in this one , it's chess . He finds it a hell of game with a lot to lose on each side . You have to know that it's kind of hard watching Columbo catch this one . You almost feel sorry for him and in that , Lawrence Harvey gives a memorable performance since his role in the Manchurian Candidate .
489935	33913	119978	7.0	An Enjoyable Grisham Flick !	Matt Damon plays a young , inexperienced lawyer in the South . It's a typical Grisham story of a young male lawyer who seeks to win his case . His case involves a young man who dies awaiting a bone marrow transplant . He is fighting the insurance company , Great Benefits . It must be fictitious but this book and story was out long before Michael Moore's Sicko and it's still relevant in today's world . Mary Kay Place plays the bereaved mother . Roy Scheider plays the Great Benefits CEO . Virginia Madsen plays the single mother who was also a claims adjuster who helped explain the insides of the company . While people lay dying , claims go unanswered and unpaid . It's your typical Grisham and relevant more as time goes on .
490091	33913	1252370	7.0	You wonder why were in a recession !	I have to say that watching the Housewives of Atlanta can be both entertaining at times and quite sad too . For five very different housewives and I use that term loosely , the series opens up with newly divorced Sheree Whitfield . She is planning a lavish birthday party with bouncers , 100 invited guests , a cake shaped as a fancy purse , and a guest list that omits one of the wives , Nene , who is easily offended by this minor oversight . Instead of getting out of the wine cellar to correct the mistake , Sheree continues to party while Nene and Kim , another housewife , return home . I can see why Sheree is divorced to a former professional athlete from his point of view . Sheree is quite vain , conceited , and self-obsessed but so are the other wives . Kim is the blonde aspiring country singer who is only 29 years old divorced mother of two daughters . She is dating somebody known as Big Papa because he wants his privacy but I want to know if he has all this money then why does he waste it on her . Kim is equally spoiled by him . She only gets the top of the line bags . For her daughter Brielle's 11th birthday party , she hires a party planner for $5 , 000 who was an hour late . Brielle gets her own Luis Vitton handbag which costs about $1 , 610 from her mother . They go to a children's store for a fashion show . They go to a pastry place for a $2 , 000 cake which doesn't take so good and end up at a nearby hotel . There is Nene who is married to Greg and has two sons . At first , I didn't like her but she grew on me . I think because she's nothing like Sheree . Nene doesn't seem to need to spend so much money but I could be wrong . She embarrasses her older son , Brice , at a trip to Clark Atlanta University . Nene learns some difficult revelations about her own parentage . I think she becomes the most human of all the housewives . DeShawn is somewhat delusional . She has this huge estate and is married mother to another professional athlete . She formed a foundation to help self-esteem in young girls but DeShawn has illusions about her life . OUtside Atlanta , I don't know anything about sports . When she tries to hire an estate manager or personal assistant , the interviews are quite uncomfortable to watch . The real-estate broker is a young married mother of a 9 month infant . She won't do anything unless it makes money . She shows a spectacular home to music producer which it even includes a garage for your golf cart . The show is better than the New York series because of the Nene and Sheree friction . After seeing the series , you also get a feel for the high society of Atlanta .
490357	33913	107091	7.0	Sweet Sentimental and a Lesson to Be Learned for the Living !	In this film , you have four very different characters including a single African American mother , Penny Washington , played by the fabulous Alfre Woodard , a country girl , Julia , who comes to the city to find herself and has to choose a life between being with her beloved boyfriend and his 75 acres in the country played by Kyra Sedgwick , Harrison , a classically trained singer who fails to sing at auditions because of his fear of failure played nicely by Charles Grodin , and criminal Milo Peck who wants to correct one of his stolen properties to it's rightful owner . They all board a bus driven by David Paymer and the bus crashes killing all of them while at the same time there is a baby boy , Thomas Riley , born into the world . The boy spends his early years talking and playing with the walls but he really is playing with the spirits who talk and interact with him . They don't know why they are with them . After thirty years , they have to go to their next assignment but they have make amends . First , they have to convince Thomas Riley played by Robert Downey Jr . as an adult that he's not going crazy or seeing things but they are actually real .
489876	33913	798753	7.0	Vicki is both Mama and Grandma in this episode !	Mama finds her beloved mother's jewelry piece which could be worth a lot of money but she is suddenly haunted by her mother's presence in her life . Her mother criticizes her like the way Mama Harper criticizes Eunice . Mama Crowley was never very nice and death hasn't changed her one bit . Mama sees her dead mother's ghost in the kitchen and living room with sound advice . She warns her not to sell the jewelry or that she would never talk to Thelma again . When Thelma speaks up to her mother , she informs her that she has worn pants , earned her driver's license , and her high school diploma . When Vint and Naomi learn the jewelry is not as valuable as previously thought but worth enough to send Bubba on a trip to Oswald Caverns , Mama has to choose between her dead mother's ghost and her living family . Vicki Lawrence does a very good job playing both Thelma and her mother in this episode .
489861	33913	80472	7.0	Bronco Beverlee ! ! !	The only reason that I got this film was to see Beverlee McKinsey as the rich New York society lady and stepmother to Sondra Locke's character . She is a wealthy heiress who runs away to join the circus . Clint Eastwood can do wrong and is probably America's best loved director . In this small comedic film , he has a stellar cast including himself as Bronco Billy , Sondra Locke as the heiress and his real-life girlfriend at the time , Beverlee McKinsey , Scatman Crothers , and others . They filmed all over the place including New York City . The story of a wealthy heiress who rejects her New York City lifestyle including her wealth to see what life is like outside only to find love is not something that you can buy or purchase at a store .
490676	33913	76625	7.0	fascinatingly bizarre	I watched this movie about five years ago in Women and Film class at Rutgers . Disappointed with the class itself and the lecturer . I was not disappointed by the wide array of films including the Riddles by Laura Mulvey . THe film is bizarre to describe . But I still am drawn to it somehow . I wish it was on video . I even felt the smell from the screen like purple at me . I never smelled a film before . I still would like to see it again for a better perspective . Whether you are interested in the bizarre and unusual aspect of film-making , this film might be for you . It doesn't really have much of a storyline . A woman wants to seek independence from her marriage but is still a mother . I never understood it and still don't but I would love to see it again if I had the opportunity . Laura Mulvey is an acquired taste that we grow accustomed too .
489819	33913	98519	7.0	Shelley Long is Underrated !	Some actresses are truly under-rated and under-appreciated and Shelley Long is one of them . She is truly a gifted comedic actress who can make you cry at one moment and make you laugh in the next . She didn't leave Cheers because she wanted a film career . She wanted to have a normal family life . Rather she was subjected to be treated like a leper on the set of Cheers . Anyway , I always hoped the best for Shelley . I still think she is one of the best talents out there today but in Hollywood , youth sells and women over 50 or 60 might as well be a hundred years old . Anyway the casting in this film is first rate with Shelley Long and Craig T . Nelson are the divorcing parents . Stephanie Beacham is always a pleasure to watch as one of her friends . Betty Thomas is delicious as the evil foe who tries to outsmart Beverly Hills Troop . Mary Gross is sweet as the unlikely ally in both parties . Audra Lindley is always a treat as well .
490389	33913	107141	7.0	It's well worth my five dollars !	I bought the video for less than five bucks at a liquidators store . I wanted the video for one of my favorite actors , Rolf Saxon . HE has a minor part and only two scenes . But in between them , the film is filled with solid performances by Kathy Bates , Natasha Richardson , Ciaran Hinds , Colin Firth , and Harry Dean Stanton . It can also be recommended for educational purposes to discuss the years when Iran and the U . S . were enemies . Besides the red tape , we learn the horror and the reasons for it . It can be a very deep movie . You almost feel sympathy for their captors too . We know that they were not all evil entirely . THey had their reasons too . While the treatment was cruel and harsh , the hostage crisis was forced to pay the world's attention to the other Israeli-held hostages !
490812	33913	96590	7.0	La Vie De France !	I really enjoyed this comedy series better in France than in England . Maybe they can bring their show to America ! If only BBC made more episodes per season like the United States , I would gladly campaign for that idea . The British make better comedies than we Americans do . First , I didn't see their previous series , Fresh Fields , with cast members Ann Beach as neighbor Sonia , Hester's mom played by Fanny Rowe , and Hester's dad played by Ballard Berkeley . Anyway , this show is better in the French version as the Fields get used to life in France . The Fields are played by veterans Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers ( another two possible British honorees ) . Julia's Hester is quite lovable but I wish she would sing because she has a phenomenal singing voice that she is also known for her work in West End musicals . Anton is better known for his other series , May to December .
490579	33913	81353	7.0	For the die-hard Popeye fans only !	I am not ashamed to admit it but I love Popeye , the cartoon and the movie starring the amazing Robin Williams as Popeye . He is almost unrecognizable in the role but completely believable . I love Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl because she really does a superb job living up to and beyond my expectations as the ultra-skinny love interest to muscular Popeye . It's like watching old friends . " I'll pay Tuesday for a Hamburger today " was a common statement . Of course , Popeye and Olive Oyl have Brutus as an obstacle to their happiness and almost the loss of Sweet Pea . It's a kind a family film too . It has music and dancing . Okay , it's not the greatest musical film ever made but it's always worth watching again . It reminds me of being 7 years old and seeing this film at the movie theater .
490144	33913	284767	7.0	Not for everybody !	Bill O'Reilly is an acquired taste . His audiences probably have a lot of gray hair if you ask me . But then again , he can be fun to watch and he is definitely fun to spoof on Mad TV and Saturday Night Live . O'Reilly's audiences are probably Republican , blue and white collar , conservative etc . His appeal is that he does tell it like it is even if it offends us liberals and everybody else who doesn't agree with his views and stance on major issues . Then again , he is practicing Catholic . Although , he doesn't practice the Catholic teachings about forgiveness and compassion as much as he should . He should work on it with his show . I don't think the beloved Pope John Paul II would have watched and given his approval to this show because O'Reilly's just angry at the way that the world has changed from his childhood . Of course , it can't be helped . O'Reilly's demeanor is the reason that most people would watch the show in the first place . He does get angry and does argue with his guests . He pulls no punches and doesn't admit when he's wrong so if you agree with him most of the time , you should watch the show and if not watch something else .
490002	33913	187664	7.0	Enjoyable British Comedy Going the Edge !	I only saw one episode because I was on a plane . At first , I didn't like it but it grew on me about cartoonist who submitted the wrong picture to the man who can change his life forever . He has to get it before he sees it . Well remember the Mission Impossible scene where Tom Cruise has to break into the CIA but it's far more enjoyable and there are laughs along the way . The cast is unfamiliar to me personally . I don't get much newer British comedies in America but I think Simon Pegg does a wonderful job as does the other cast members . It's kind of quirky and silly but really enjoyable . I think Simon Pegg goes over the edge regarding the show's comedic appeal . It's not so much about Spaced as it is about average ordinary life in London and the characters who wish they were anything but ordinary and average .
489749	33913	320052	7.0	It's less than perfect but a great show !	I am a very difficult viewer with television comedies today . I do enjoy this show because the writing and acting are worth watching . MadTV's alum , Will Sasso , brought refreshing energy to this show . Where is Eric Roberts and when will his famous sister , Julia , make a cameo ? Of course , the casting is brilliant with veteran Sherri Shepard and Andy Dick . I wasn't pleased about Joanna Kerns and Valerie Harper playing his lesbian mothers . I would have preferred Estelle Parsons instead . Anyway , Less Than Perfect is a great show and works well . Bring back Caroline Aaron , she's a scene stealer . Sadly , they changed the schedule so many times and this show ended up lost somewhere in the prime time mess and ended up being canceled when the ratings weren't that high .
490788	33913	90395	7.0	Amen ! Amen ! Amen !	Amen was a good sitcom . It was set in a Protestant Church led by Sherman Hemsley's character . The show had a stellar cast including Jester Hairston , Roz Ryan and Barbara Montgomery as sisters which was truly believable , Clifton Davis as the new pastor and the love of the head minister's daughter played by Anna Maria Horsford . After a while , you began to believe that this environment existed . It was set in Philadelphia which was a change of pace from New York City . Amen and 227 were usually aired on Saturday nights before Golden Girls . Amen was a well-written , acted show . It was the kind of church that I wished I belong too at times . It also showed that Sherman Hemsley was talented to hold his own show as well besides being best known as George Jefferson . He will always be George to us but we have to acknowledge that the Jeffersons did move on and prospered as well and rightfully so .
490245	33913	71347	7.0	Columbo in a Think-Tank of All Places !	It's one of the better ones but it has a strange setting . Dr . Nicholson played by Hollywood actor , Lew Ayres , is an aging doctor with a young , attractive but equally successful psychologist played by Jessica Walter ( mom from Arrested Development ) and Jose Ferrer as the chief suspect in the crime . Even COlumbo has his work cut out for him because all of these intellectuals are geniuses as well . Anyway , COlumbo surrounded by geniuses has been done in another film . But in this episode , it's a small community . Jose Ferrer plays a devoted father but his son is keeping secrets from him that will not only destroy his career but his father's as well . The pressure must be unbearable in their community . Anyway , the story works fine with great actors like Lew Ayres , Peter Falk , Jessica Walter , and Jose Ferrer .
490261	33913	387898	7.0	Still has great acting but weak plot !	I love Daniel Auteil who I think is one of France's leading male figures in the cinema business . He is brilliant in any role . He is France's answer to Cary Grant in my opinion . In this film , he co-stars with Oscar winner and fellow French actress , Juliette Binoche , as a married couple who are haunted and stalked by an unknown figure . Auteil plays a television reporter in Paris and somebody is after him but the movement in slow and the plot never really picks up speed to explain why . Of course , his character has flashbacks to his rural childhood in France . His relationship with his son is also interesting but despite his arguments with his wife , the character never becomes alive to me . I feel like the plot just stays stagnant . The cinematography and the beauty of Paris and France is worth watching the movie . I will watch it over again just to understand what is going on .
490717	33913	82121	7.0	Still a Lovable Film !	Let's face it , Cicely Tyson and Richard Pryor play an unlikely pair . Cicely plays a good-hearted social worker who is determined to transport a school bus-load of abandoned orphans across the country to a farm with animals . She gets Richard Pryor's character who plays an ex-con who redeems himself in this film . Of course , Tyson and Pryor are quite simply marvelous in roles that would have otherwise failed . I know if I wanted somebody that would be Cicely who plays Vivian Perry whose heart and mind are always in the right place . While Pryor's character feels like a failure , she and the kids inspire him as well he inspires them . It's not a wholesome after-school special but it's touching at moments to see the outcasts look and treat upon each other as friends and family because they could have treated this film like silly film but it's a serious film about serious problems and they do it admirably .
490749	33913	97084	7.0	It could have been worse !	Columbo always likes to get his man or woman . This time , it's Robert Foxworth who plays a military man . Sam Wanamaker better known and respected for his role in rebuilding the Shakespeare Globe Theater on the Thames in London , England returns to direct a Columbo . He is a veteran director and it shows . Of course , I think it could have been better . The writing was a bit weaker than most and I think it could have been a lot better in the acting department but I love Columbo and I have seen almost all of them many times . I think even the casting would have been better besides just Falk and Foxworth in the roles but I'll take Columbo with the good , the bad , the ugly , and sometimes brilliant episodes .
490366	33913	102933	8.0	Sizzling True Story !	Few stories are worth adapting to the screen . Elizabeth Montgomery gives a mind-bending brilliant performance as Ruth Coe , the beloved and twisted mother , of serial rapist Kevin Coe . It's not enough that her own son has been found , arrested , convicted , and imprisoned as the South Hill Rapist in Spokane , Washington . The South Hill Rapist struck usually in the mornings during his mornings when he jogged . He also struck about forty known victims and there were probably more than fifty knowing some who didn't report the crimes to the authorities . All the while , Mommy Dearest Ruth Coe refuses to believe any evidence and defends her son to the hilt . Elizabeth Montgomery's performance is chilling as is Dale Midkiff who plays her son . Now the real Kevin Coe might be released unless the state of Washington can place him on a island where he can be imprisoned for life as a dangerous sex offender . Even to this day , Spokane has not recovered from the years of terror as the South Hill Rapist struck and attacked his female victims .
490211	33913	323332	8.0	Dame Maggie Smith Rules this Film !	Dame Maggie Smith plays a successful British author who travels on train with a group of unsuspecting passengers . She befriends a young girl named Aimee . I love Maggie Smith and her performance was one of her best roles in years . She plays a classy , elegant author who lives very well in Umbria . Tragedy occurs when the train explodes leaving her , Timothy Spall , Chris Cooper , Aimee , and an older gentleman besides herself as survivors . She decides to bring them to her home in Umbria , Italy where she gets to know them . Sadly , Aimee's life is not all what it seems . One of the younger men loses his love and another man has a secret . They all have secrets but the movie is based on William Trevor's novella who is one of Britain's best known authors . Anyway , the filming , the art direction , and the acting is pretty decent considering the script is a bit weak .
489761	33913	75864	8.0	Odd Title but entertaining !	I agree it's entertaining . Peter Falk as Columbo is always entertaining and even in this one . It's an odd title though from his others . Don't miss Jamie Lee Curtis as the uptight waitress and the great British actress , Samantha ( I forget her last name ) as the unhappy spending wife of the prime suspect . It takes place at a club house for the geniuses of SOuthern California and the prime suspect is a genius who kills his partner genius rather than lose his fortune . Of course , the smarter the prime suspect in Columbos , the harder it is catch them or at least we think so . Anyway , Columbo does his best job to make sure he catches his man or woman . Of course , this episode is not one of my personal favorites but it's always worth watching again .
489863	33913	83470	8.0	Steele steals the scenes !	The casting of Pierce Brosnan as Remington Steele , private investigator , and Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt , the private investigator who conjured up the name in order to get her business moving . After all , a woman private investigator did not fare well in the world . Remington Steele pops up and there is obvious chemistry between the two characters . Steele is charismatic , charming , and seductive while Holt is more straight and lacks a sense of humor at times . There is no question that Steele steals the scenery right out from under her . Anyway , the two cast mates do have chemistry . The addition of Doris Roberts before she was known as Marie Boyle on Everybody Loves Raymond gave her a supporting role . This show was light but not as a feather nor dark or too serious . It had a comedy and drama mixed in together which was why it worked for 5 seasons in the golden age of television .
490461	33913	68190	8.0	A Classic Children's Story Brought to Life !	Fiona Fullerton is better known for her role as Alice in this production of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . She rises to the occasion but my only complaint is that we always see Alice as a blonde . The cast is first rate which Dame Flora Robson OBE , Peter Sellers CBE , Sir Ralph Richardson CBE , Dudley Moore CBE , and a cast in costumes as caterpillars , mice , rabbits , and Queen of Spades . The film is really for children and adults who love Lewis Carroll's classic tale of Alice in Wonderland . John Barry OBE has provided the musical score for this film production . The film also has superior art direction , costumes , and a whimsical happy mood for it's audience . It is really Fiona who does justice to the role of Alice even in a first rate cast of actors and actresses .
490361	33913	640572	8.0	Here's Your Dime , Spill It ?	Mama Thelma Harper has been accused of being forgetful while Naomi rescues a dog known as Old Lady from the parking lot at Food Circus . Since Mama doesn't care for dogs , Naomi , Vint , Iola , and Bubba pretend that the dog barking doesn't exist . So Mama thinks she's hearing things or going crazy by the sound the dog barking . Unaware of Old Lady's existence , the family now has an answering machine which Iola gave to them . It's funny how they each take turns leaving the message for the recording . The messages about how the Old Lady should be put to sleep or go to a home where she can run around and be sedated have Mama Harper on edge . They think the messages are for her and when food is disappearing from the kitchen table . Mama thinks she's going insane .
490121	33913	89853	8.0	Partially Shot in my Hometown !	I remember when this film was being filmed in my hometown which seemed so long ago . Woody Allen and his crew came to my town for a couple of days and shot the diner scenes in South Amboy at this old fashioned diner . Unfortunately , the business was moved to New York but anyway I remember the newspaper that covered it . I never saw the film until years later . I recognized the diner and I remember eating there once . but besides that , the film is quite entertaining about life and wanting to live inside the movies . Jeff Daniels does a superb job in making us believe that a movie character can leave the screen . Of course , we know it's not possible . Mia Farrow does a superb job in the role as Cecilia , the unhappy waitress and wife . The story was well-written but not Woody's genius .
490011	33913	110997	8.0	It's a must for Streep fans !	It may be one of Meryl Streep's most daring performances as a river rider . With Kevin Bacon as a sleazy robber and murderer . He is awfully good at being bad . Overall , the movie is a good thrill ride . It lacks swearing and the violence is minimal too . It's just so predictable but not unbearable . This is a Curtis Hanson film before L . A . Confidential . It's a good film because we see Meryl practice her sign language . Meryl never gives more than 100 percent even in this role as a woman . David Straitharn plays her husband from Boston in this film . He would later get nominated for his role in Good Night and Good Luck . Kevin Bacon is fun to watch as the evil robber and murderer . You will just have to wait and see the ending as predictable as it is . It's still a thrill ride .
490607	33913	100808	8.0	A decent portrayal but lacks some emotion !	As somebody who takes interest in PAn Am 103's tragedy , I find this film plays around the publicly known events . If I had any say , I would have tried to focus on the human emotions of those who lost their relatives and friends in this crash . The film chronicles the events preceding the tragedy . I wished they would have made a conscious effort on examining the humans lost on 103 like on 9-11 . Pan Am 103 was really the beginning of a war on terrorism for us . Pan Am 103 was our first warning which we ignored foolishly . If we had paid more attention to the events preceding the tragedy , we could have prevented 9-11 . Pan Am 103 did not crash against a building but a small street in Lockerbie , Scotland . The residents there have never recovered emotionally neither have the families of Pan Am 103 . 15 years later , we're still asking what happened . I have to say it's first rate casting with Timothy West , Peter Boyle , and others . It seems terrible that nobody paid close attention and we all have to ask why we didn't pay any close attention now . It's still a good film about the tragedy . I think they should have showed the names of those lost on the darkest day of the year .
490015	33913	781238	8.0	Not that Flaming Forties !	Buzz and Sonja need a gimmick or theme for their upcoming dance . Mama suggest the 1940s since the gymnasium was used as a USO Canteen and she was charge of the donut patrol . Anyway , the materials that have been collecting dust in the attic is slated to be sold at a rummage sale at the school . When the school dance hires a band called Medication , a punk band , Mama's dream of once again living in the 1940s and pantomiming to one of the Andrews Sisters with help from Naomi and Fran go up in smoke . When she realizes what she is about to lose with Aunt Fran , she goes to the dance and the band doesn't show up with good reason . They got arrested . Anyway Naomi and Vint are chaperoning the dance while whose chaperoning the chaperons is Mama's response .
490551	33913	80761	8.0	Today is Friday the Thirteenth !	This film was low budget with cast members such as Betsy Palmer as Mrs . Voorhees and an unknown young actor named Kevin Bacon . The plot is simple . A bunch of young adults go to the campsite to set up a summer camp . They filmed this in Blairstown , New Jersey which is on the border of Pennsylvania and still pretty much country and rural rather than urban or suburban . Anyway , this film was a low budget much like Halloween . It all takes place there . It's funny and will scare you silly . The cast is decent . The scenery is picturesque and the story is interesting enough to keep you watching . You hope that they always air this film on Friday the Thirteenth which is today and in October . Only 18 days before Halloween , another frightening holiday , anyway , I think the film is worth watching if you are into the horror stuff . Even now , I have seen this film several times and the sequels never could compare to the original . It's really Betsy Palmer's film . She's best known for her role as Mrs . Voorhees still to this day .
490242	33913	89510	8.0	Excellent Television Movie !	Mare Winningham is really one of the great unsung American actresses of our generation . She is exceptionally talented whether she is playing the daughter of a deaf couple who must sign language to communicate with her parents . She is the their ears to the world and often must translate between her parents and the hearing world . One memorable scene is her at the funeral home translating for her parents and the undertaker as a child for her brother's unfortunate death . Winningham's performance is award-winning as is the mother played by deaf actress , Phyllis Frelich . Her character seeks to be independent and hopes that her parents can adjust to the hearing world .
490569	33913	793139	8.0	Slightly Out of Order of Sequence !	Vinton Harper has fallen head over heels over his next door neighbor , Food Circus Cashier-Naomi Oates ( played beautifully by All My Children star Dorothy Lyman ) . Naomi has just sold her home and got $5 , 000 . They go to the Bigger Jigger , the local hangout in Raytown where the show is set . After a few drinks and they return to the Harper House , Naomi and Vinton finally give in to their mutual attraction to each other . They were one of the most affectionate couples on television . Vint and Naomi spend the night in the basement where he shows her his TV Guide Collection . Of course , Mama Harper would blow the roof off when she learns that Vint had a woman over much less Naomi Oates , her neighbor who often gives her trouble . Rather than give up the relationship , they decide to get married .
490814	33913	94137	8.0	Not bad ! Quite funny !	It turned out to be a good idea after all . I actually liked this movie since I have seen it years ago . I can't remember until now the appeal . It's actually cute and well-done without any real nonsense . It actually makes sense when you watch it . It is actually entertaining without overdoing it . It's a great family movie too . There are hilarious moments between the men and baby Mary . I only wished she had a better name than Mary . The cast is first rate with Tom Selleck , Ted Danson , and Steve Gutenberg as the three fathers and Nancy Travis as British Sylvia . I love seeing Celeste Holm playing grandmother to baby Mary even if it was for only a moment . They have quite a ball with baby Mary in their lives even though she was a surprise beyond belief . Baby Mary usually steals the scene because of her beauty . Babies are beautiful and fun but lots of work for one parent , much less two or three or four parents . I won't give away the ending but I think they should have filmed it in New York City rather in Toronto but that's just my opinion .
489743	33913	243664	8.0	It's worth watching once !	Emma Thompson really blossoms as an actress in this very difficult and moving portrayal of middle aged college English professor . It was based on a play but I can't imagine anyone playing Vivian Bearing than Emma . She plays a woman with ovarian cancer . Her battle with cancer is long and difficult and not short of pain . She becomes bald and the film flashes back to her childhood with Harold Pinter playing her father . The most heartbreaking moment comes when her mentor played by Dame Eileen Atkins visits her . We never really get to know much else about Vivian's personal life . She was married to her work and Jonathan Donne . This film was directed by the great Mike Nichols and is worth watching . It's no TV movie of the week . It is a well-written , entertaining and heartbreaking film .
490635	33913	96580	8.0	It Wasn't Amazing but It was Good !	This show had legs and an interesting plot . Jon Cryer plays Teddy Z , a guy who doesn't want to work in the family business , a Greek bakery . Instead , he would rather work in show business . he gets a job in the mail room and gets the attention of a film star who wants him as his agent . With little or no experience , Teddy Z gets the most unlikely promotion . I remember Alex Rocco as the old time agent without a heart or conscience who is Teddy's mentor . I remember Jane Sibbett as the cold , ruthless woman working to get to where Teddy is . Teddy got there by being himself and not some determined , egotistical college graduate who start by working in the mailroom and hope to be secretaries with a promotion to agents . Too bad , they cancelled it after a year .
489993	33913	441051	8.0	Overall , it's funny now scream your heads off !	One British woman , Catherine Tate , is multi-talented enough to play several roles in her titled show including the woman is not drunk enough to find her date attractive enough , or the woman who screams at anything because she is easily scared , then there is the couple of new parents with a sleeping baby who won't get out of the car for the mother's birthday party because the baby has finally fallen asleep and don't want to risk the sound of waking her up . Also , there is the couple of women who work in an office cubicle where she keeps asking her to guess how much whether it's weight or money . Catherine Tate might be a new face but she is somebody to watch out for in the future . She's very talented and capable of maintaining a sense of humor throughout the program even being unrecognizable . She does a fabulous job at showing off her craft of British comedy . Now if we can only get it in America .
489775	33913	92312	8.0	Jump for Jump Street	This was Fox's first serious drama . It was aimed at a young audience . 21 Jump Street had a great cast including a young Johnny Depp , Peter DeLuise , and Holly Robinson among the cast members , good writing , and innovative plot about young cops posing as high school students to capture a wide variety of criminals in the school system . The show lasted a few seasons on Fox without network infiltration like other major networks . It lasted long enough to leave its mark on the baby network . Now there are a dozen shows like 21 Jump Street without the cleverness and the strive to be better than just the average shows on TV . In fact , the show was probably the first American drama on Fox to be filmed on location in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada to cut costs . In the beginning of the Fox network lineup , 21 Jump Street launched a unique way of looking at secondary schools with a great cast . It was never awarded an Emmy which it should have been even nominated for Best Drama .
490730	33913	123179	8.0	A Great Version of the Classic Tale	I loved Mr . Magoo growing up . We don't see him much anymore on television or this special around the holiday times . We see less and less television programming devoted to the Christmas holidays . Jim Backus uses his voice as Mr . Magoo , the four eyed actor , in this special where he plays Ebenezer Scrooge , the Charles Dickens character , forever immortalized in all sorts of holiday tales . Just like the story of a Christmas Carol , there are three ghosts and Marley , the predecessor who warns Scrooge to change his ways . Okay , this version is not the best out there but it's timely and good for kids and adults and fans of classic animation . I bought the tape years ago and just played it around the holidays . It's a treat to watch every year .
490637	33913	86704	8.0	Lot Going for It !	Okay , this was the E / R show long before the drama on another network . It was a comedy and drama and a very good comedy too . The cast was first rate with Elliott Gould as the head doctor and Mary McDonnell playing the new doctor . If the show lasted longer , they would have probably gotten together and got married . George Clooney played the nephew to Conchata Farrell who is better known to audiences as the maid , Bertha , on Two and Half Men . She played a happily married childless nurse who doted on her nephew played by Clooney . The show had a mixed cast of characters and never really took off as it should have done . maybe there were just too many sitcoms on the air that even those above average got canceled after one season . It played on cable for a while only to be forgotten .
490078	33913	64381	8.0	Philip Roth at his best !	I have been doing a lot of research on the author , Philip Roth , who wrote Goodbye , Columbus . Unfortunately , I am disappointed that it was set in the Bronx , New York and not Newark , New Jersey and that Westchester County replaced posh , upscale Livingston , New Jersey . What makes Roth special is that he really is a New Jersey writer even though he has lived in Connecticut for decades . Unfortunately , the story does not lose any of it's original impact as it was written in his novella . Richard Benjamin and Ali McGraw are excellent as Neil and Brenda . Neil Klugman , the Jewish librarian from the Bronx , and Brenda , the Jewish girl from Westchester , who get together . The relationship is believable at times while Neil is from the wrong side of the tracks so to speak while Brenda's family is upscale . Just because they are both Jewish doesn't mean that they don't have their share of problems . Jack Klugman and Nan Martin are perfect as Brenda's parents . The film would have been better or more authentic if it was set in Newark and Livingston rather than the Bronx and Westchester but what's done is done . I hope next time that they will take the time to film where it is set . It's not set that far from New York City anyway .
490308	33913	90501	8.0	Perfect Friday Night Fare !	I have to admit that Balki and Larry were the male version of Laverne and Shirley . The show had a unique premise and it worked best with Bronson Pinchot as Balki who reminded me of Andy Kaufman on Taxi . Anyway , the show was never controversial or raised any eyebrows . It had it's moments including the relationship between Larry and Balki that emerged from complete strangers who were distant cousins to best of friends . The cast included the under-rated Ernie Sabella , JoMarie Payton France whose family would spin-off to more successful Family Matters . Friday nights on ABC were reserved for light family comedy fare . I just wish that they would bring sitcoms back . Bronson's role and performance was one of the best in a long time .
490767	33913	107665	8.0	Has a few problems but is worth watching !	The story of Needful Things comes from Stephen King , who else could it have come from . A store opens up in a small Maine town ( where else ? ) called Needful Things . The funny thing is that it's owned and operated by Christopher Plummer who appeared in Stephen King's DOlores Claiborne . Anyway , he is the devil in disguise . He coordinates trouble . The stories sometimes are problematic with me . I thought the Elvis mom who spends all day long playing Elvis Presley music and sleeping with a statue of him was pretty bizarre . I only saw the TNT version so I am sure there was editing going on . Ed HArris and Bonnie Bedelia are perfectly cast as a couple who try to escape the devil's lure but they are only the few who are able to escape . Valri Bromfield plays the hot-tempered local who seeks vengeance thanks to the devil . The story of Needful THings has a purpose . Be careful what you wish because it might happen and you wouldn't be able to control it . The town soon learns that they are messing with something inhuman . Anyway , it's worth watching for sheer entertainment . You can't get too caught up with it or you'll go crazy .
489822	33913	99148	9.0	A Sad Tragedy South of Me !	This mini-series is one of my personal favorites . It was one of the first to show New Jersey not as gang-related or as urban but suburban Ocean County in Toms River , New Jersey . Joanna Kerns does a beautiful job playing the mother and the late Robert Urich does an equally superb job playing the father . The boys were played exceptionally well in despite of the growing suspicion of the father's involvement and his obvious guilt . He is still on New Jersey's death row and will never get executed in the state . I remember when I first watched this mini-series on television and later I watched it on lifetime . The mini-series depicts the story of a family who should have had it all only to blow up in the face of Mr . Marshall who arranged his wife's murder to collect insurance money . You can't forget Dennis Farina as the prosecutor in the role , Doris Roberts who plays the loving blinded older woman who helps with the boys , and Robin Strasser does a superb job playing the mistress who finally helps bring down Marshall . I am not saying that she wasn't guilty but you know that you can't judge somebody .
490346	33913	47673	9.0	Still a Christmas Tradition !	I remember when the Christmas season came after Thanksgiving and the networks all began showing Christmas films especially White Christmas and It's A Wonderful Life . Anyway , I liked White Christmas but only for the ending . It was kind heartwarming and sentimental at times but still you can't beat this cast featuring Bing Crosby , Danny Kaye , Rosemary Clooney , and Vera Ellen . Of course , there is romance in the air and a plot to help an old friend out . The film is dated but still beautiful in color and should be seen to be appreciated . Stay till the end of the film when you see those four wonderful stars of yesterday sing White Christmas with the white snow in the background . It's worth watching during the holiday season . Rosemary Clooney used to say that Bing would see her on Christmas Eve . You think they're all in heaven serenading God and the angels with White Christmas .
490713	33913	824045	9.0	Thanksgiving to Remember !	It's the family's favorite holiday , Thanksgiving Day , with Aunt Effie on her way , Bubba in the holiday parade , Naomi's centerpiece , Iola's fish , and Thelma in the kitchen making turkey . It's a family holiday but it's one of the worst days regarding weather . Mama says it doesn't rain on Thanksgiving . Effie has brought her rum balls and Mama's gravy boat isn't on the table . When a tornado blows through Raytown , the family go to the basement hungry and bored . They play cards , argue , and try to find a way out after they stuck down there . It would have been nice if a relative telephoned like Eunice , Ed , Ellen , Buzz , or Sonja or even have them visit for the day . Still , it's a memorable episode and one of my favorites .
490054	33913	78703	9.0	Classic British Comedy !	To the Manor Born is about how old money and new money don't necessarily mix very well . The show stars the wonderful Penelope Keith CBE OBE ( a comedy veteran ) who plays Audrey Fforbes Hamilton who represents old money and Peter Bowles as Richard Devere who represents new money . After Audrey's husband and lord of the manor has died much to Audrey's dismay , they didn't have a good marriage . She lets out a scream that she finally free to rule the Manor . Unfortunately , Audrey learns that she is in debt after his death . She must sell her beloved home to Richard Devere , a self-made millionaire entrepreneur who really is both Czech and Polish heritage . She sells but she moves close by and is still active in her community with her best friend played by a terrific actress whose name I can't remember . Daphne Heard plays the wonderful foreign born mother of Richard . The episodes are all classically funny and it is one of Britain's best exports . Penelope Keith is one of Britain's brilliant funny ladies up there with Patricia Routledge CBE OBE and Dame Judi Dench .
490067	33913	87482	9.0	Way ahead of it's time !	Drew Barrymore is probably one of the youngest actresses to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in this film . This role came after her ET fame , remember her as little Gertie . Pity the other stars in that Spielberg film never became the household name that surprisingly that Drew has accomplished . She has got quite a pedigree with the Barrymore legacy . Despite her personal problems , Drew really is a solid actress with a lifetime behind her . Anyway , I never saw this film until Sunday . I remember it being out but I have to say when I was 11 years old , I wanted to be Drew Barrymore ( that was before I knew what happened to her ) . So I guess , I didn't watch it out of envy . I like the casting of Shelley Long who is probably one of the greatest female comediennes of our time who never gets enough work in my opinion to let her talents shine . She can do both drama and comedy equally well . She combines them both in this role as a desperate housewife turned writer . I like the way the film is set up with blame on both father and mother . Sharon Stone debuts in this film too . Ryan O'Neal is worth mentioning because I don't think he was acting in this film . It just hit too close to home . SO you want a good comedy from the eighties , this is pretty good . It's probably a classic compared to contemporary comedy that has become both vulgar and profane .
489813	33913	22183	9.0	A Brilliant and Chilling German Classic !	What's a girl to do when she is surrounded by women in a female boarding school ? She falls in love with her female teacher who shares some mutual feelings . This film is not so much about lesbianism as it is about Germany was striving to become so disciplined and unfeeling towards one another . Of course , lesbianism was bound to happen . There were no other options . You have a girl who wants to be loved and love just seems unthinkable in the German culture of the Nazi uprising . Even though this film was made in 1931 , the girls ' uniforms reminded me of the concentration camps uniforms . The school was trying to discourage close relationships between girls and among teachers and students . I don't think of it much as a lesbian film as a chilling portrait of how Germany was bounded for destruction during World War II . Maybe the film points as a good reminder of how relationships should be encouraged and feelings are human . This school was trying to restrict the girls ' humanity into an almost robotlike existence . That's how I always saw this film . I never thought of it as a lesbian film because the girls in the school had no other choice or option . They weren't allowed freedom and that's what the major theme of this movie is . Germany was beginning to restrict it's freedom on their citizens and forcing them to become less human in order to succeed but that's just my opinion .
489902	33913	78562	9.0	It was never the same as the original but still worth watching anyway !	Carroll O'Connor's character Archie Bunker was so popular that the network could not let him go so easily . Jean Stapleton , Rob Reiner , and Sally Struthers were eager to move away from their television personalities . But let's face it , they were on one of the most popular sitcoms ever and for them , it is both a blessing and curse as well . Archie Bunker's Place had a girl , Danielle Brisebois as the Jewish girl from Edith's side of the family . I remember watching Anne Meara , Liz Torres , and others who try to recreate the magic that was All in the Family but the show is still superior to anything on television today so I'm being a little more liberal because the character of ARchie Bunker became an American icon and part of the fabric of American culture that we would miss him too much . THis show allowed us to slowly move on . We love Archie Bunker and the actor who played him , Carroll O'Connor . For most of us , we'll always think of him as Archie .
490386	33913	46911	9.0	Just in time for Halloween	Diabolique is an excellent film . It has terrific actors like Simone Signoret . What makes it terrific is the suspense and horror that goes with it . From beginning to end , it is a film in time for Halloween . It will make you shiver with suspense . That the truth is stranger than fiction . It is a twisted version of the Children's Hour . The Black and white version is better than any colorized version . I watched a dubbed English version . To see it is to believe the " diabolique . " I would have loved to have seen the French version without subtitles to improve my French but this tape was worth the price and it's frighteningly good beyond belief . The ending is worth watching again and again . The film is well-written and acted .
489887	33913	86742	9.0	A good quality show with a great cast !	Kate & Allie was one of my favorite shows when I grew up . It was also one of the few NYC based sitcoms filmed in New York City . Jane Curtin and Susan St . James play divorced best friends who live together after their divorces with their children in a Greenwich Village apartment . Of course , the apartment is unrealistically huge and is only affordable for the millionaires . The writing is genuinely funny and worth while to watch . It was one of the best comedies in the eighties . I remember when CBS's Monday Night was the place to be with shows like this on the air . Those days are long gone now . As for the rumors that they were supposed to be a couple , maybe that would be on television today . Sadly , it's not uncommon for sisters with their children to live together . I always assumed that Kate and Allie were more like sisters rather than best friends . Back in 1984 , two divorced women living together with their children would not have sparked the controversy . They went to high school together and they dated men as well . Their arrangement was platonic but they were family without anything offensive . Maybe they should have written them as sisters to avoid the controversy . The network insisted the show ending with them going to separate beds at the end of each episode to avoid that speculation .
489727	33913	86730	9.0	Highway to Heaven with Two Angels !	Okay , Highway to Heaven was one of those feel-good dramas with a heart and soul . Of course , Michael Landson's last show brought us one of his finest acting performances as angel sent to earth to help the mortals make amends with their loved ones , relatives , friends , and themselves . All the episodes had a heart and soul kind of feeling that made you want to reach out and grab a handkerchief . This show was one of the better shows of the 1980s . Sadly , Michael Landon and Victor French died shortly later . They both acted wonderfully as friends , travelling companions and nothing more on a journey that took them all over the country . We don't have shows like Highway to Heaven anymore and I hope they will bring it to DVD soon .
490053	33913	112096	9.0	Penelope Keith runs this show !	Penelope Keith CBE OBE is better remembered for her roles as Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton in " To the Manor Born " and " The Good Life " as Marjery Ledbetter . In this series which was prematurely shortened , she and William Gaunt plays parents and grandparents who must raise their three orphaned grandchildren after their son and daughter-in-law have died in a car accident . The children are now orphaned and now must be raised by their grandparents who are not normally affectionate towards children even their own son . The news and circumstances that they must endure but the writers do a splendid job in bringing the unlikely pair of grandparents who probably would prefer traveling the world rather than raising their own grandchildren . This show could have been a hit if it was allowed too .
490773	33913	63518	9.0	The near perfect adaptation of Shakespeare's classic !	This adaptation is probably the finest involving Romeo and Juliet . Olivia Hussey is superb and so is the young Michael York as Tybalt . Milo Shea plays the friar who helps Romeo and Juliet . It's a tragedy . We all know the story but after viewing it in my high school days , I can't imagine a better film to show adolescents about Romeo and Juliet who were doomed from the beginning . The story of Romeo and Juliet is as old as time . The director does a superb job in recreating the magic , fire , and romance on screen in this film . We believe that we are transformed into their world of Verona , Italy . After seeing this film many times , I tried to watch other adaptations but anything fails in comparison to this classic Romeo and Juliet . The costumes are precise and beautiful . The scenery is lovely and of course the acting is all done seriously and brilliant at the same time . This film deserved it's nominations and awards . It's not easy to take Shakespeare and make it unforgettable but the director has sure done his job .
490747	33913	97082	9.0	Very Entertaining !	Soap stars Ian Buchanan from General Hospital and the always beautiful Deirdre Hall from Days of Our Lives are involved in a disappearance and possible murder of a publisher . Of course , this brings a slew of much needed publicity for a starving magazine . Gigi Rice has a role as well . It's a familiar story with Ian playing a British Hugh Hefner style younger man and his empire in financial ruins . His partner is played by the beautiful Deidre Hall ( she hasn't aged in years ) wants out of the business . Of course , the motive is about money . Columbo episodes try to use simple motives rather than complex and the crimes are always pretty simply done whether it is done with a gun . We are never truly left with a gruesome crime scene in Columbo episodes and that's a good thing because Columbo has always been light-hearted at heart and his interactions with the prime suspect is always fascinating . When he thinks he's wrong , he's not .
490416	33913	68611	9.0	Not one of the Master Hitchcock's Best but not the worst either !	Watching Frenzy from Sir Alfred Hitchcock is quite fascinating . The cast features the great Billie Whitelaw C . B . E . , Clive Swift ( Keeping Up Appearances ) , Jean Marsh ( who should be awarded Damehood by now ) , the unforgettable Vivian Merchant in a great small role as the cop's wife who likes to cook French cuisine . Of course , Anna Massey who plays one of the victims . In the murder sequence featuring Barbara Leigh Hunt ( another British actress worthy of a British honor and is one of Dame Judi Dench's very best friends and the godmother to her only child ) was difficult but yet unbelievable to watch . Just when you think he might let her live , you are wrong . She is the first murder victim and the whole rape and murder is shown explicitly . We know who the killer is all along but we don't know how they are going to catch in the act . The murder of Anna Massey was done differently because once they entered his character's apartment . The door becomes closed to us as the spectator . We don't know how bad it is until later . So watching how the murderer escapes from this one is quite unforgettable . You think he'll get caught and the movie is worth watching because of the London locations alone .
489746	33913	61240	10.0	Still my favorite show !	I loved the Carol Burnett show when I was a child . It was in half-hour reruns . After spending the last weekend watching TV Land marathon , I just learned why . It was one of the most entertaining experiences in television history . This was a great cast of highly talented people not just the beloved star , Carol Burnett . Her former husband Joe Hamilton produced the show . Her friends like Harvey Korman , Tim Conway , Vicki Lawrence , and Lyle Waggoner were all uniquely talented and gifted . We can see why this show thrived . Most of the cast were there from beginning to end . After 11 years of superb Emmy winning and golden globe episodes , the show is available on DVD and can be seen on TV Land where it belongs with some of television's classics . It is still a classic . Sometimes Saturday Night Live and MAD TV can embrace the wholesome comedy as a risk in itself .
490438	33913	68327	10.0	One of the Greatest All Time Musical Films !	Cabaret was far different that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical films like The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins or Oklahoma . This film was decadent for the time of Berlin before Hitler's rise to power . As the Nazi movement was gaining power , Berlin residents like Sally Bowles played by the one and only Liza Minnelli had relationships with men and lived on her singing at nightclubs until she meets Michael York ( When will he be knighted ? ) anyway he plays the writer . Joel Grey won an Oscar as the Maestro . I loved the movie and won't bother to see the musical whether it's Judi Dench or anybody else playing Sally Bowles . THere was only one person who played Sally Bowles to me and that was the divine Liza with a Z . She totally becomes the character . When you see this film version , any musical whether the West End in London or Broadway in New York City will always be second rate to this cast . Of course , the fact that Bob Fosse directed this gem and changed the musical films forever from light and happy to dark and sad like in Cabaret . It's eerie to think that the people in the Cabaret have no idea of the horror that lies ahead with World War II and that's terrifying in general . I won't give away much but that this is Liza at her finest and best .
490665	33913	363352	10.0	Come to the Magic Garden !	When I was five years old , it was my favorite television show . I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday . The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this children's television show . They sang songs and read stories to us as children . It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over . I remember Sherlock , the puppet , in the tree . The show taught us how to count , add , subtract , and the alphabet . For thirty minutes a day now , I learned something new with Paula and Janis . I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories , inexpensive props , riding the swings , and talking to puppets . The set was ideal and simple but it was Carole and Janis who made it worth while while . I miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the Magic Garden . Life seemed so much simpler and better . Now , I hope the kids today enjoy the show .
490199	33913	68120	10.0	Won't Be the Same Without You , Bob !	I can't imagine anybody else than Bob Barker hosting the Price is Right . After all , he has been hosting for decades . Now in his youthful eighties , he is retiring . No longer will he be the game show host or retired . The game show is based on the normal people , randomly chosen by the show's announcer to come on down to be one of the four bidders . Once you win the closest bid to the item , you win the item and get on stage with Bob Barker which must be a thrill in itself . If you're lucky , you make it to the final round and get a chance to bid on possibly a new car , expensive vacations , etc . You can win both showcases if bid under a hundred dollars on your showcase . The show won't be the same without him . He's the heart and soul of the show . They named the studios after him . Nobody could fill Bob Barker's spot now or never !
490817	33913	640615	10.0	Classic Episode !	When Bubba come home drunk and causing trouble , Mama Harper gives him a hard punishment . It's not until Iola explains about Thelma's experience with Eunice years ago . In this episode , Thelma and Eunice were scheduled to perform a mother-daughter act at the mothers and daughters luncheon at the church . Iola played amazingly unrecognizable by the actress , Nikki Cox , as a young girl who needs Thelma . Meanwhile older Eunice has already planned to be used and abused by Duke Reeves and his friends . They already have her making their sandwiches for the picnic . The actress , Heather Kerr , who plays Eunice does a brilliant job . Unfortunately because Vint's a boy , he can't go to the luncheon . Anyway , Eunice is brought by Duke Reeves , the love of Eunice's life , and she's wasted away . Thelma has to get her sober enough for their solo . Thelma sends Duke Reeves away . When Eunice sees Duke gone , she blames her mother for sending the love of her life away .
489807	33913	1010048	10.0	Absolute Best Film of the Year ! The one you can't miss !	Truthfully , I didn't want to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater on Christmas Day but my sister wanted to see this film . It was a remarkable experience because it far exceeded my expectations . The casting was perfect with three actors playing the main role of Jamal Malik who goes from the slums of India to possibly becoming the first person to win the grand prize in Who Wants to Be A Millionaire ? In the beginning , he is suspected to have been caught cheating and is interrogated for the night quite harshly but it's nothing compared to his life . He works as a gopher for a telemarketing office in Mumbai which is India's Hollywood . There is a reason for everything and the film is well-thought out and executed to perfection . The young actor who plays Jamal is brilliant in the role . Everybody in the film really delivers as well as the thousands of extras . Of course , there are difficult scenes to watch but I won't go there and spoil it for those who haven't seen it . I can see why this film is a front-runner for the Oscars . It has everything going for it including a great cast , a great script , and directed brilliantly with the perfect edited portions .
490618	33913	640542	10.0	Classic Lost Episode !	Who says you can't have fun when you're old . In this episode which features guest stars like Imogene Coca as Aunt Gert and Jack Gilford as a resident of a nursing home . Mama Harper visits Aunt Gert at the nursing home and is appalled by the treatment of the nurse played by Barbara Stuart who treats them like little children rather than adults . When Mama takes charge , things start to change and Aunt Gert comes back in form as Mama remembers her with the spunk and vigor in their youth . This episode for some strange reason does not get played often enough . Somehow it is either lost or forgotten but it really should always be on in syndication . Unfortunately , I'm praying and hoping for season two of Mama's Family . We can only hope that they'll restore the episodes so we can always enjoy them .
490826	33913	103360	10.0	13 Episodes Weren't Enough !	The Ben Stiller Show proved that good comedy exists out there . Unfortunately , Fox never gave the show a chance and it was cancelled after only airing twelve episodes . In fact , the show earned an Emmy award in the following year . The show is brilliant satire of television and modern culture of the early 1990s . I love Melrose Heights 902102104 etc . which fuses the shows of Melrose Place , Beverly Hills 90210 , and the Heights ( which was shortly canceled ) all into one . I love Janeane Garofalo who was in her element whether playing wife to a sock puppet named Skank , a prim and proper telephone operator , or spoofing Shannen Doherty . Andy Dick is also memorable as is the show's star Ben Stiller who is on the verge of stardom . I love the pilot episode where they spoof the group of U2 and Bono is singing for a cereal and at a Long Island Bar Mitzvah . The fact that they got the same manager from the Partridge Family is genius as is Paul Dooley who shows . They spoof Monkees with the Grungies in Seattle , Washington . I love the DVD and I wish there was more of Ben Stiller Show to go around .
489767	33913	74330	10.0	Jack Cassidy , we still miss you !	All I knew about Jack Cassidy was his sons who were in the Hardy boys . He died before I got to know him . I think this is my favorite Columbo episode with him as a magician with a secret , he was a Nazi in Germany during World War II . Cynthia Sikes plays his lovely daughter who is clueless about her father's identity and history but she is memorable and she is better known for her role in St . Elsewhere . Sadly , I hated reading about Jack Cassidy's tragic death . Wherever you are Jack , we miss you still after 30 years . Columbo always catches his man or woman even in this episode . As Columbo always says , there is no such thing as a perfect murder . Just when you think he's got away with his crimes , nothing could be further from the truth . If you love Columbo , you will love this episode and how he catches his man is just as much fun to watch and learn .
490265	33913	89560	10.0	Cher's best performance to date !	It's sad , depressing , and inspiring to watch this movie about a disfigured teenager and his wild mother played by Cher . It is the teenager who acts more like a parent to her . He is smart , brilliant , kind , generous , and has no many qualities lost by the tragedy . Cher's is untouchable and deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for this role . Even though there are times of sadness and tears , this movie will lift your spirits . There are also wonderful supporting performances by Estelle Getty who plays Cher's mother , Laura Dern who plays his blind girlfriend in one of the most touching love stories in recent film history , Sam Shepard as Cher's boyfriend in the film , Alexandra Powers , but one of the most moving and touching performances is by Eric Stoltz who is unforgettable in this movie . He should have been nominated for an Academy Award along with Cher . This film is truly a tear jerker . So bring your hankies !
489868	33913	460091	10.0	Gotta love Earl and Jason Lee	I like Jason Lee as an actor ever since I saw him in Dogma . In this quirky television show , he plays lovable Earl Hickey who wants to redeem himself and bring karma to his life . He creates a list of over 200 people , deeds , and mistakes that he made . Last night on NBC , they aired 4 episodes and I was in love with Jason Lee and Earl . This comedy is well-written and well-meaning . I loved the episode with the multi-talented and recently won an Emmy , Kathryn Joosten , who is quite his match . I could watch Kathryn in anything . I hope she reappears in this show too . I don't care for much of the supporting cast . I feel that Jason Lee is the heart and soul of the show . There is no audience like in normal sitcoms . I miss that today . While I am laughing at the show , I am enjoying what other critics have enjoyed . I know that I have disliked Arrested Development simply because I could not stand the characters . But with Earl , you have to like him . He reminds you of somebody . Maybe it will encourage others to change for the better and improve their karma .
489975	33913	102719	10.0	Still lots of fun !	I am giving this film a perfect score because I think it's still worth watching again and again . I love John Ritter and Jack Warden as father and son . You can't forget Junior . Amy Yasbeck who first played his wife in the first film now plays a lovely school nurse who has a problem child of her own . I love Gilbert Gottfried as the annoying principal . This film was never meant to do anything but be fun and it does it just fine . I like seeing MArtha Quinn and Charlene Tilton act as possible second wives to Little Ben Healy . Of course , Loraine Newman is great as the multiple divorced bride who wants little Ben Healy and can't stand children . Her scenes with Junior are fun to watch . Of course , they double the problem child with Ivyann Swann who plays Trixie . She does a devilish time making trouble for Junior as he comes to a new town and school . I love the Problem Child movies and wished that they moved to television rather than stay in film . I never saw the third sequel because they don't have John Ritter or Junior , that lovely red head boy . It's for kids , parents , and anybody who wants to laugh .
490606	33913	319343	10.0	Great Family movie for people of all religions !	Will Ferrell is a comic genius . Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film . The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film . There is rarely expletives or violence in the film . Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan , Mary Steenburgen , Ed Asner , and Bob Newhart . If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching , this is it . I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show . He is an untapped comic genius in his own right . Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems . Will Ferrell is worthy of the success . He is brilliant , likable as Buddy . How can you not love him after seeing him in this film ? If you're a fan of SNL , you will know why there are volumes of his best work . He is simply incredible comedic genius and we love him at our house .
490653	33913	395169	10.0	The Timing of the Actual Genocide could not be anymore poignant !	In 1994 , Steven Spielberg and the film , Schindler's List , won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman , Oskar Schindler , caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives . Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda , Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow . Just like Paul , Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps . While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa , we know very little about Rwanda . In 1994 , the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups , the Hutus , and the Tutsis as enemies again . The order was removed . The Hutus were incited by hatred , lies , propaganda , and direction from their leader to kill those " cockroaches " known as the Tutsis . By the end of the genocide , almost a million Tutsis were murdered . Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company , Sabena , who is put in charge . His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu . The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets . For those sheltered at the Hotel , Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food , water , or supplies . Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis . The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes . Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated . I wished it was nominated for best film of the year . Unfortunately , the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide . Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea . This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994 .
490134	33913	388789	10.0	A Brilliant , Perfect Documentary of Forgotten Children !	This documentary is about the children of the Calcutta Red Light district whose mothers and fathers are sex workers . The mothers are prostitutes and the fathers are usually pimps . The women are in a line where they are chosen from their clients to perform sex acts . The director is a New York City based photographer who first came to Calcutta to photograph the women of the red light district . She started to bond with their children and introduced to them the world of photography . Not only did she do that but she tried to assist the kids into getting to schools particularly boarding schools to escape the life of the red light district which is often filthy living conditions . The documentary is worth an Academy Award because it has a purpose well beyond any statue . The kids are worth saving and they need a better life .
490258	33913	443781	10.0	An Excellent Summary of the DaVinci Code !	Host Patrick Macnee ( who should be knighted by now but that's another forum ) provides a clear , concise history of Leonardo Da Vinci , the famous artist created the Last Supper and Mona Lisa . In this documentary which was probably inspired by the craze regarding Dan Brown's book about the Da Vinci Code , the documentary goes into detail about how the ideas formed from the Knights Templars to the Gnostic Gospels which were priceless in itself . For those of us who are interested in biblical scholar , this documentary is quite effective without being so overwrought with details and information . The experts are quite excellent in explaining the information about the theories and the life of the time .
490073	33913	117631	10.0	Shine ! Shine !	It's hard to be an artist , both talented and in turmoil by inner demons like David Helfgott . Geoffrey Rush deserved his Oscar for this role . He truly brings the character alive and well to the audiences . Lynn Redgrave deserved a supporting actress nomination for her performance as the woman who would turn out to be the love of David's life . Googie Withers , one of Australia's best known actresses , played beloved Catherine , his mentor and financier in David's younger years . John Gielgud has a brief but memorable performance . I like the fact that they filmed this film in both Australia and England . This film really examines mental illness and how David triumphs over the odds . He was down and out and forgotten . Somehow when you hear his music , you remember how much he triumphed over the odds . Despite his mental breakdown at what would have been the beginning of an extraordinary career , he was down but not out . He had to recover and slowly work his way back to the living . When David plays music , he becomes alive and genius to us . Many people have been where David has been and are still going through the pains of life . This movie is an inspiration for all of us , artists-writer , performers , painters to get up and rise again . When he returns to play live in a small Perth bar , you get chills down your spine . It's a great kind of film and you wish to be in Perth , Australia .
489977	33913	40053	10.0	Red , White , and Blue All Over ! !	I watched a video of the Ed Sullivan show . It was entitled " Red , White , and Blue . " It was a patriotic compiled tape which everybody in America should own . I was born after the show's cancellation so I never saw the original . But I can tell you after watching this tape , it was probably one of the best television shows of all time . In this tape , they have the great Henry Fonda doing the first Lincoln address . Dame Judith Anderson reciting the Gettysburg Address . Carl Sandburg offers the Lincoln Birthday address and the great Charlton Heston gives the second Lincoln inauguration speech . There are great musical numbers with Dale Evans , the West Point crew , and Kate Smith singing " God Bless America . " They also have Joel Grey singing " Yankee Doodle Dandy . " Grey's not James Cagney but it's worth seeing . This short video tape is only an hour long from Sofa Entertainment . Now if you are a history teacher , an American patriot , American lover , or just patriotic , this tape is worth the money . I bought 2 copies and gave it to history teachers that I know of . It's also worth buying for your home .
490512	33913	67306	10.0	Absolutely Divine !	What makes Shakespeare such a classic production is the talented actors like Paul Scofield C . B . E . , C . H . and Irene Worth Honorary C . B . E . in their roles as King Lear and Goneril . I saw Irene Worth on Broadway in Lost in Yonkers but that was nothing compared to her role as Goneril . You forget the other actresses who play Cordelia and Regan . Her role of Goneril is chilling , complicated , icy , yet divine to watch . She really packs punches into this supporting role . Why Paul Scofield and Irene Worth were not nominated for Academy Awards is a shame because this film really works with the both of them in these roles . I can't imagine a better Goneril or a King Lear . The film was edited for the obvious reasons that all of Shakespeare's language cannot be used effectively but Peter Brook is a genius in knowing what Shakespeare would have wanted in this film . Peter Book C . B . E . , C . H . is a Shakespeare expert and well-respected and beloved British director . He has done a remarkable job in bringing King Lear to life with a master such as Paul Scofield and Irene Worth's Goneril is absolutely divine ! You can't take your eyes off her in this role .
490538	33913	86879	10.0	Breathtaking ! Stunning ! Worthy of Every Award !	There are few films out there even today that can match Amadeus ' incomparable genius . For starters , the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F . Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , two rival composers . When Abraham speaks , you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well . He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well . It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri . Anyway , the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable . The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries , jealousies , and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred . Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support . I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor . Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family . I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole . British actors like Roy Dotrice ( when will be honored ) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same . It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view . You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna . Salieri's father died while he was young . We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens . Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music . He loved parties and people while Salieri preferred music . Oh what a film for the ages !
490543	33913	89069	10.0	An Excellent Television Still Relevant for Today's Audiences !	An Early Frost was by far superior . It was done gently without insulting or preaching to the audience . It was one of those movies that helped explain homosexuality and AIDS to the audience without being angry . Of course , Aidan Quinn does a beautiful job in his role as the young homosexual . It is heartbreaking movie . I love Gena Rowlands as the understanding mother . Movies like this made you think about the subject of homosexuality and AIDs in a time when we lost the legendary Rock Hudson who was openly gay in Hollywood but closeted to the rest of us who didn't know anything about . Movies like this were when television movies could have rivaled the cinema industry . They don't make many films with sensitivity . HOmosexuality has become a long running joke and AIDS has new victims like women and children . It's a shame that they don't make movies like this anymore . AIDS affects everybody not just family and friends .
490612	33913	218839	10.0	A great effort !	I have to say that this movie recently aired on Comedy Central and it was addictive to watch couples with their dogs at this Westminster style dog show in Philadelphia . It is great cast with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara paired again in another Christopher Guest film . Levy and O'Hara were wonderful and sweet as the small town odd couple with their dog . Parker Posey was wonderful as the yuppy wife . Jennifer Coolidge and Jane Lynch provided some laughs . Even Chris Guest played a part as well as directed and co-wrote with Levy the script . There are very few quality films especially something satirical and wonderful as this film . It's worth watching ! I loved Ed Begley Jr . as the hotel manager .
490266	33913	107614	10.0	Robin Williams deserved an Oscar nomination at least for this one !	Robin Williams is a comedic genius . While I am not entertained by most family comedies , Mrs . Doubtfire is a winner . It can make you laugh easily . Robin's role as a divorced father who wants to spend more time with his children is actually truly believable . Even his role as Mrs . Doubtfire is performed superbly . Too bad , there is no sequel to this film . And the fact that San Francisco plays a big role in the movie is another reason to see it . Like New York City , San Francisco plays a character in this film . It is America's most beautiful city to be compared with the likes of Paris and London . Don't miss this movie ! It really is a family oriented film . There are great performances by a superb cast including Sally Field , Pierce Brosnan , Harvey Fierstein , and Anne Haney . Robin was sure robbed of an Academy Award nomination . It could not have been easy to put on so much makeup and transform himself into Mrs . Doubtfire . My favorite scene is the transformation with Harvey Fierstein where Robin uses his great voice to experiment with a Cuban Doubtfire , a Yiddish Doubtfire , and singing Matchmaker with Fierstein is the best part of the film .
490832	33913	88727	10.0	Every Girl Should See This Film at Least Once !	This mini-series is an excellent example of how television should be . The acting is first rate starring Canadian Actress Megan Follows in the role of Anne Shirley which displays great acting range for an actress so young . If this was released in the cinemas , this film would have garnered Oscar nominations for Megan Follows as Anne and of course , the wonderful Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla Cuthbert as well Richard Farnsworth as Matthew Cuthbert , a pair of siblings who adopt Anne reluctantly to care for on the farm on Prince Edward Island . Of course , the story doesn't end there . By the time we finish watching this extraordinary piece of film , we want more because these characters and the actors who portray them become very dear to us . We love Anne for all her faults and her amazing sense of humor and adventure . A person like Anne brings out the best in everyone and Megan Follows performance certainly displays a loyalty to the author's intentions . Apart , the direction , cinematography , acting , writing , and art direction is first rate and would have garnered Oscar nominations easily .
490541	33913	81858	10.0	The Dynasty of Wine Country !	I loved this drama . I thought this was better than Dynasty . I loved Jane Wyman playing the role of matriarch . The casting was first rate and the writing was stellar if not better than Dynasty and Dallas combined . The cast included Kim Novak , Ana Alicia , Lana Turner , Lorenzo Lamas , and so many others not to mention who graced this show at some point . The show always carried itself more like a drama than a soap opera . I always felt that Falcon Crest was treated unfairly in favor of the more outrageous Dynasty or Dallas . There were no cat fights or explicit or outrageous behavior . They always appeared with class , style , dignity , and grace . That is why I think it was superior to it's other shows . Falcon Crest came on and stayed with us for nine years . We're waiting for DVD .
490348	33913	108515	10.0	A Must See for Any Political Aficionado !	I was taking a course in American Government at Rutgers when I saw this film . I fell in love with George Stephanopoulos right away . James Carville is always a delight to watch with his Cajun tongue and enthusiasm . This film documentary chronicles the Clinton election in 1992 . I can't believe I miss that period now . Of course , the War Room is not for those who don't care anything about politics . The boy from Hope gave us hope and a promise that was fulfilled . Sure there was the sex scandals , at least they were interesting , the economy was headed in the right direction and we had surplus budget . Now , we're in two wars with no end in sight . Still , the War Room reminds us of the promises and the hope around election day .
490806	33913	68646	10.0	Definitely one of the best films ever made	The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast , genius writing , and direction . Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo , the book to film could have been a disaster . The story is well-told in length and detail . Characters are built up and explained well . After Godfather , it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie . This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch . You just can't leave it yet until its done . People know the Godfather backwards and forwards . I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast . While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language , the movie leaves you breathless . Pacino , DeNiro , Duvall , Caan , Shire , Keaton , were unknown until this movie was released . We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski . His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible . You can't help but watching this film over and over again .
