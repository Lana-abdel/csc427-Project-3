490043	33913	123366	1.0	Just Awful ! Mail Rosie a mussel to shut her big mouth !	Believe it or not , I watched this show in the beginning in 1996 and I was a fan of it then . Not anymore , I grew to lose respect for all of the co-hosts at one time or another . Never did I think that Meredith Viera would announce to the world that she is not wearing underwear . Debbie Matenopoulos was far better than her replacements despite her sometimes idiotic comments . Until yesterday when Star Jones Reynolds announced her departure from the show did it hit me , I can't stand Rosie O'Donnell to begin with because she is a lying hypocrite of a human being and for her to succeed Viera's departure only supports my decision to have stopped watching . Who wants to see Rosie O'Donnell again as a talk show host anyway ? That was what was behind Star's departure was the Rosie's arrival . Not that Star is herself blameless , she has changed a lot since her surgery and her marriage but she managed to maintain some of my respect . After all , she is a lawyer and I don't think she's no dummy . Barbara Walters , what have you done to this show since it first aired 9 years ago . I could see why Meredith is leaving for better opportunities . I can't stand Joy Behar anymore who I used to enjoy watching as a comedian . I had respect for Star Jones until this show and watched it deplete over the years . Debbie's replacements have never had the same magic as the show once did when it premiered and even less when Rosie joins the show . With Star , I wish her and Meredith the best . But come on , Barbara , you can go outside and get somebody off the streets of New York City who doesn't talk English and do a better job then Rosie . They could be homeless , drunk , and wasted and I bet they would be funnier and more original than Rosie O'Donnell could ever be . I was reading that you were going to ask Marcia Cross about those lesbian rumors in front of her parents even though she was engaged to a man at the time but Marcia's quite a lady but you lost her respect . How many other people's respect are you going to lose now . Maybe Barbara should retire herself . Now if Barbara was smart , she would have gotten Kathie Lee Gifford to take over Meredith's spot . I plan on watching something less argumentative , maybe I'll switch over to Jerry Springer from now on .
490132	33913	385890	3.0	A Big Fat Mess of Epic Portions !	Okay , I wanted to like this movie because I love spoofs and satiric films but this movie was way over the top . It was a combination of Pulp Fiction , A Big Fat Greek Wedding , and other films but the script lacked sense and the cast of characters were nobody familiar . I applaud first time directors who try to be innovative but the film needs some type of structure and I hope that they keep trying to spoof films whether classic or sensational . You can spoof so much more like Titanic and other popular forms of film . There is so much but you can't do it all in one film . First , the casting should have been better . The location shooting was fine but like again the film kept shoving popular film spoofs in our face . Most of us haven't seen all the films that they are spoofing .
490491	33913	56758	5.0	Butcher Jill Farren Phelps does it again !	After Santa Barbara , Guiding Light , Another World , and One Life to Live , the Soap Butcher Jill Farren Phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows . When I was watching Guiding Light , it was at its peak in 1991 . They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps . She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death . She killed off beloved Ellen Parker's character Maureen . So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience . On Another World , she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell's beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline . On One Life to Live , I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover . Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role . I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow . The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely . She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death . Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones . Why aren't the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick ? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps . I know Monty's heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn't successful as the Luke & Laura days but still , I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps . Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people . I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps ' known favoritism for certain actors . I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair . But I know after 25 years of watching soaps , I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew . I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me . I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans . Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation ! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat . Remember Another World ! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live . What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen . Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children . Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years . I'm concerned that she is going to lose one of the show's best attributes , the Quartermaine Family . She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute . Even with John Ingle's welcome return , the shadow over the show is still different . I don't blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon's departure . It's as shocking as it comes . This is what you get when you have somebody like Phelps at the helm .
490409	33913	184858	5.0	a mixed bag of goods !	This film is not one of the director's finest works despite it's all star cast with enough twists and turns for a roller coaster ride at an amusement park . Ben Affleck plays an ex-convict whose cell mate gets killed in a prison fight . Ben's character , Rudy , meets up with Ashley played by Charlize Theron . Just remember , nobody is truly what they appear to be in this film . Ashley's brother , Gabriel , is played by the under-rated Gary Sinise who is far more deadly than any of Rudy's prison pals . First , they think Rudy is truly Nick Cassidy , a former casino worker . The mixed-up identity allows Rudy to spend some quality time with Ashley . By the time of revelations , nobody is truly what they seem to be and relationships are revealed that are not always proper . I think Rudy / Nick learns the truth about Ashley's life . By the end of the film , you're actually cheering for Rudy because he turns out to be the hero but I won't say how he does it or what happens . I don't want to spoil the film's ending .
490165	33913	1376649	5.0	I am so sick of the countess bit !	I am so sick of LuAnn needed to be called by her title . In this episode , there is a humorous moment when she calls to order pizza and says " countess De Lesseps . " Now I don't know if you order pizza in the real world but the pizza place doesn't care about names as much as getting the right address and paid with a tip . LuAnn seems so transparent as if she earned her title . She married for it . Just remember that the French aristocracy were decimated by the French peasants during the Revolution . Regardless of her husband's job , even people with titles don't flaunt it or demand it as much as LuAnn . If she was in England , it would be different because they are used to titled people but not in America . Even people with titles like dame or knighthood after they earned it , don't demand the recognition that Luann seems too . I was surprised to see her actually doing dishes because her housekeeper / nanny Rosie went to visit her family in the Philippines for a month . Still we don't see the housewives do housework . Even her book on manners and etiquette is coming out with her title of course as if it matters in this day and age .
490278	33913	327162	5.0	Give Me A Break !	First of all , I know this was only filmed a couple of years ago . They progressed Stepford by having a white gay couple but you are telling me that the perfect world of Stepford is lily white . I mean if you can have a gay couple , you can't have an African American couple and Hispanic couple in Stepford . This is 2004 . As for the remake , this movie is a comedy . The first movie version at least had the effort to make it a thriller . I love Roger Bart as the gay husband / wife but it's redundant for him . After all , when he's cast as straight like George Williams on Desperate HOusewives , he becomes a homicidal maniac obsessed with Bree . Nicole Kidman is good in the role that Katharine Ross made famous . Bette Midler is always welcome although not on film sets because of her difficult behavior . I love the casting of JOn Lovitz as her husband , John Malkovich and Glenn Close as the all too perfect Stepford couple . The movie is entertaining but it's 30 years later , times have changed . I guess the message is that it's changed for gays but not for African Americans or Hispanics in this country .
490757	33913	167427	5.0	Okay , it's silly but lots of fun !	First of all , Glynis Johns should be made a Dame of the British Empire by now . She is in her 80s but she provides a service playing Mary Catherine Gallagher's loving grandmother . Molly Shannon is also incredibly funny if you enjoy her role as Mary Catherine Gallagher who sniffs her armpits when she's nervous and knocks over everything from pianos to tables . Will Ferrell is very funny as the guy she chases . There are lot of familiar faces from Saturday Night Live besides Will and Molly . Of course , I don't think this movie should have been in the cinemas . It would have fared better on Comedy Central just for laughs . Oh well , I have one question is that when the beloved Glynis Johns will be made Dame Glynis and that is the question .
489823	33913	96555	5.0	British version of ER	I'm sorry but I am beginning to see a pattern of British dramas which I dare say is quite bland . The acting , the writing , and even the sets are just similar . Holby City and Casualty are two separate shows but I can't tell the difference . The actors and actresses look the same and I'm sure that the cast of characters of one show end up in the other at one point . Does it matter ? Is Casualty popular enough to have spin off series like Holby City ? I can't answer it because I don't live in the United Kingdom . It would be nice to see a familiar face among the cast . I watched Coronation Street and see the familiar faces of some cast members . EastEnders is popular simply because Wendy Richard who played Pauline Fowler for 21 years was the heart and soul and not to mention that she was a cast member of the popular comedy , Are you Being Served ? and Barbara Windsor who is better known for her roles in Carry On series . That's the problem , I think the shows are stepping stone . In America , we have actors and actresses who have stayed and that's important is the regularity . I'm not saying that British soaps are bad . No way , British soaps like Casualty and Emmerdale are an important factor of British culture . I encourage people especially tourists to watch them . British soaps can be both funny and sad , happy and entertaining as well as enlightening . Don't think that I don't appreciate the British contribution to soaps because I think Britons are quite appreciative of their existence where as in America for example , soaps are only the stepping stone to their careers and sometimes the highlight .
490070	33913	304711	5.0	So much promise only to be disappointed !	I have to say that I was expecting more from this film . Heath Ledger is great as the devoted priest and Mark Addy has his fellow priest from the same order . The beginning of the film has questions that are never really answered at all . I was not surprised by the fact that they had to bring in a character , Mara Williams , for sexual scenes . Yes even though the film should be about priests and their quests for the cause of their beloved mentor's death . That's what it should have been about but it becomes something else completely . I spent 2 hours watching this on a cable station . I was intrigued by the beginning but then the priest played by Heath Ledger which began fine but he is sidetracked by his lust for Mara which I think ruins the character . These priests are member of a dying order , the Carolinians , and are involved in exorcism supposedly . But yet when Heath's character meets with the Sineater who wants him to take over his job of absolving sins . He is torn which becomes preposterous . I love Mark Addy and he is being wasted and the same for Heath Ledger . There was not much integrity into developing the story of this film .
490638	33913	112002	5.0	Never Made It Up High Enough !	I was thrilled that Jean Smart and Mary McDonnell were going to do a sitcom probably inspired by the British comedy , Absolutely Fabulous , about two upper class spoiled New Yorkers . Faith Prince was terribly underused and under-rated . She was supposed to be huge after her triumphant performance in Guys and Dolls opposite Nathan Lane but Smart and McDonnell did what they could with a terrible script . I was hoping that the show would last longer than it did which was only a few episodes . Both actresses are accomplished veterans of the sitcom genre that they should have used their experiences to make this show better . Maybe the idea of two rich and spoiled divorced women are reminiscent of The First Wives Club . I didn't care for that much neither .
490145	33913	358135	6.0	Dirty Dancing for the Mature Folk !	It has a great cast with Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere as a married couple in Chicago . Jennifer Lopez has a supporting role as one of the dance instructors and Stanley Tucci who is always fabulous plays one of Gere's colleagues and dance enthusiast . Anyway , the plot about the husband going to dancing lessons and the wife suspecting that he's having an affair is a bit far-fetched but the cast works well together even if the storyline is weak . They filmed some of it in Chicago , a great city to visit . Anyway , the film is somewhat corny and predictable about the dance contest . Still it can be worth watching anyway with a great cast and crew . I forget who played Bobbie , the star dancer , she is familiar to me .
490233	33913	310460	6.0	Forget George Lopez ! Give Belita her own show !	Now George Lopez Show is not a bad . It is worth watching a few times . But what I think is the best part of the show is Belita Moreno who plays Bennie , the mother of George Lopez . Belita Moreno is certainly worth watching out for ever since she played a secretary in the television film , Death Benefit . I am glad that she is getting recognition in her own right but I think she should get her own show when the George Lopez Show is over . There is something talented and brilliant in Belita's underrated performance . She really has the comedic perfect timing as the gambling , fun-seeking grandmother , mother , and mother-in-law . Bennie is not your typical granny making cookins in the kitchen . She works , gambles , drinks , and likes to have a good time with her friend , Gina , played by the wonderful Elmarie Wendel . She and George are great together with their exchanges . Belita is one to watch for in this series . It's why I watched her in the first place . As Bennie , she is always entertaining and delivers her lines as naturally and wonderfully to George's straight face . I didn't care for the opening segment . I think it's silly with everybody jumping up and down . I think with better writing , it could be a better improved show . We'll just have to wait for the upcoming season .
490005	33913	247150	6.0	it's absolutely hell	While Dame Judi Dench is magnificent as always , this play is dreadfully depressing about the lives of London life after WWII . But my biggest problem with it is the more than average homosexuality in the drama . While Dame Judi plays the tragic lonely heroine who would plead for the companionship of a homosexual . The play is rather a grim and depressing too watch . Surprisingly , I did watch most of it . But I have to say that Doris is the only one sane reasonable character . Granted , she is a sexually repressed character who uses sports as an escape . She is the only one who makes the proper observation about the barflys or members as escaping into alcoholism and sex .
490847	33913	75529	6.0	Sugar and Sweet and Everything Nice !	Let's face it , it was not the best of shows but not the worst either . It had lots of wonderful guest stars who livened up the show . When I finally took a cruise to Alaska , I was expecting a love boat scenario but that's not what I got . Love Boat is indeed fantasy with a great theme song sung by Dionne Warwick and a decent cast that included Gavin McLeod , Jill Whelan , Lauren Tewes , Fred Grady , Bernie Kopell , and Isaac ( what is his real name ? ) . Anyway the scenario was usual about a three day cruise to Mexico and back to Los Angeles with guest stars that included several of Hollywood top stars and the ones that were not on top . For a while , I think the Love Boat provided a great service of keeping the B-list guest stars working . I won't name names but we know who they were and we don't care . Love Boat is a comedy mixed with a little bit of drama . They never did anything serious or offensive . Of course , it was a Spelling show which meant that it was eye candy , sugar and sweet , and everything nice .
490617	33913	918782	7.0	Lose a Promotion and Gain a Dream !	When Vint loses a job promotion , the family takes him out to the Bigger Jigger Bar and Restaurant where it is Amateur Night . To lift his spirits , Mama , Naomi , and Fran all suggest for him to go on stage with his Fred Astaire number and sing " Puttin on the Ritz " with Fran on the piano like he did at a recent family reunion . By the way , I believe Ken Berry began his career in vaudeville or tap-dancing into show business . Regardless , he knows how to tap-dance . When he wins the prize of $100 . 00 and is going to perform for an upcoming night . He decides to change his name to Johnny something , give up the hat and cane , and Fran on the piano . Of course , Mama realizes that the contest has turned him into a monster which makes Naomi the bride of Frankenstein .
489817	33913	118689	7.0	Could have been a lot better ?	Dr . Bean comes to America . They think he's an art scholar and historian but he's only a watcher at the British Royal Art Gallery . They would like to fire him but somebody higher won't let them so they send him to America with a valuable painting of Whistler's Mother costing somebody 50 million dollars . Rowan Atkinson is one of Britain's best loved comedians . He becomes Bean , this man-child , that nobody understands maybe except for Peter McNichol's character . I love them together . They had a great chemistry with their comedic talents . He plays the art curator whose wife played by Pamela Reed thinks Bean is a certified weird and strange and won't let him stay with the family . He thinks it would be a good idea to welcome Bean into the family home . I think it would have worked to see how Bean interacts with his teenage daughter and son . There could have been great more comment moments with Bean interacting with the family . We don't know much about Bean .
489878	33913	640593	7.0	Presents Galore !	It was either Mother's day or Mama Harper's birthday or something of that nature . Since they don't air the episodes on television anymore nor is it on DVD , it's one of those holidays that presents are expected by Mama . For Vint , his boss , Mr . Carstairs , played wonderfully by the late Graham Jarvis asks Vint to hide a present for his wife at his house which is an expensive piece of jewelry . When Mama Harper finds the present hidden by accident , she assumes it's hers and exchanges it for something more practical . When Mr . Carstairs comes calling for his wife's present , Vint finds out and the mess has to get solved . How will Vint pay for an expensive present that he didn't buy in the first place ?
490821	33913	640579	7.0	Get ready to rumba !	When Naomi recognizes one of the wrestlers from the ladies of wrestling on television as an old friend , she gets her friend to come to dinner . It turns out that she might have to forfeit because her wrestling partner had an injury . Naomi resist but decides to help her friend out by being her wrestling partner . Naomi and her friend are fine until her friend suffers an injury and Mama comes in . You can imagine how Mama looks in the hideous costume and wrestles with the big girls from the wrestling . This episode is your typical Mama's Family fare with the family and Iola who are interested in the ladies ' wrestling . It was popular in syndication at the same time that Mama's Family was in syndication . I don't know the story behind this episode but I remember watching the ladies wrestling in Saturday afternoon and watching Mama's Family in the early evening on Saturday .
490536	33913	424627	7.0	It May Be Set in Paradise ! But It's not Paradise !	Watching Dog is quite interesting . I have to admit that I don't find him attractive in the least . Maybe it's the tattoos and the hair , he does act more like a professional wrestler . His wife and partner , Beth Smith , is his perfect match . His sons also help in bringing runaway bail breakers to justice . If these people were smart , they would realize that breaking bail is a serious offense anyway . I can't believe that this is all happening on the beautiful , idyllic Hawaiian Islands . Obviously , I have never been to Hawaii but long to go . They show a side of Hawaii that's not in the tour books because life in Hawaii does have a price in itself . It has crime , poverty , unemployment , and drugs as well . As a tourist , we would only see what the tour books write about . But at least Dog and his gang are showing us that even in paradise , crime occurs . They could do this anywhere but the fact that they are based in Hawaii shows us that even in paradise , you can't escape the pitfalls of life .
490726	33913	116240	7.0	If you are really into Terms of Endearment !	I was kind of disappointed . I was expected the same from the sequel with the role of Aurora Greenway played by Academy Award Winner Shirley Maclaine again . Of course , Jack Nicholson won his second Oscar for his role as her lover . In this film , Aurora deals with troubled grandchildren who she helped raise because the father was absentee . One grandson is in prison and her granddaughter is as stubborn as her daughter Emma played by Debra Winger was . Also Miranda Richardson plays a Texan friend that wanted to raise Emma . Also Marion Ross is cast in the role as Rosie Dunlop , Aurora's maid or housekeeper . There were some changes like ROsie lived at the house but Marion Ross earned a Golden Globe nomination and probably would have earned her Academy Award nomination if the film got better reviews . Marion does an excellent job in making us care so much for Rosie .
489768	33913	74327	7.0	Where ever he goes , murder follows should be his motto !	Columbo is on vacation in Mexico and he is a stranger to this country . Guest stars Ricardo Montalban stars as a celebrity matador who kills the man who knows his deepest secret . A . Martinez from L . A . Law , Santa Barbara , and General Hospital has a memorable role as the son of the victim . Anyway , it's typical Columbo with a usual formula . He gets entangled with his own problems . They mention a previous crime solved in another episode entitled " Troubled Waters . " Well anyway , this Columbo episode doesn't rank up there as one of my personal favorites but it is worth watching great actors like Falk and Montalban have exchanges and A . Martinez perform in a supporting role . Even today , Mexicans are rarely seen on mainstream television shows and it gave a very different exposure rather than everybody in the country crossing the border . Nobody seemed in this episode to be racing to get over the Border . Keep that in mind and nobody was smuggled in Columbo's car .
490247	33913	69903	7.0	Double Exposed !	Columbo has to match wits with Robert Culp again in this episode . I don't know offhand how many episodes that featured Robert Culp but I remember this one . He is a scientist who specializes in mental manipulation . I couldn't think of another way to explain it . Anyway , Columbo has met his match in this episode . Robert Culp's character kills somebody who wants to destroy his professional reputation as a top scientist who helps improves sales in grocery stores and other ways . Anyway , you have to watch how Columbo catches him . Like a typical episode , he becomes interested in his line of work but does not forget the victim or the crime . It's worth noting that it's pretty sophisticated in 1973 and I would watch it again if I have too but it's not my favorite episode of his or with Robert Culp .
490836	33913	74292	7.0	Great Cast ! Great Ride !	I happened to catch this film today on a cable channel . It was worth watching again . Unlike other disaster films , this film was an original set on a train with a plague ridden passenger . Aboard this Paris bound train , it's changed to a place in Poland which was a concentration camp to quarantine the passengers . What the passengers don't know is that they have to cross " The Cassandra Crossing " which is poorly constructed bridge in Poland that can't handle the train's weight . Even the former residents have left living there because of the bridge's danger . I thought this film has a lot of thrilling sequences even with the seventies music and score by Jerry Goldsmith . The cast is first rate with the late Richard Harris ( who should have been knighted ) , Sophia Loren , Martin Sheen , Ava Gardner , Lee Strasberg , even O . J . Simpson is cast in an unusual role . I haven't watched anything with Simpson since 1994 . I thought Lee Strasberg was brilliant as was Burt Lancaster and Ingrid Thulin as well .
490324	33913	85049	7.0	It had Agnes Nixon all over it !	When Loving first premiered , it was big on television . After all , this was the child of two great and creative geniuses , Agnes Nixon and Douglas Marland . It had great potential and lasted for as long as it could . It never recovered from Ryan's Hope as a lead in show . I remember the cast . The actors and actresses were pretty and the set always looked like you could put it on All My Children . But sadly , the show never maintained or garnered a large audience like All My Children . There is no question that there were great actors on the show like Wesley Addy , Celeste Holm , Christine Tudor , Larkin Malloy , Lisa Peluso , Nada Rowand , and more that I have forgotten . I haven't seen the show in years but it never got much recognition like it's sister shows , All My CHildren and One Life to Live . Maybe if Douglas Marland had stayed on as head writer , the show would have become more like AS the World TUrns . But the truth is that it was worth watching when soaps ruled daytime . Now , there is only 1 30 minute show on the air .
490741	33913	1376650	7.0	Back from the Hamptons !	While the gang of New York housewives split their time between New York City and the Hamptons , we get to know more of the gang . My favorite moment was when I saw Alex and Simon in one of those inflatable swimming pools that you can get anywhere in their backyard lounging around . They are not Hamptonites and don't want to be . Too much partying and little relaxing in the Hamptons with the New York City crowd . Well , Bethenny is finally becoming a strong independent woman who is looking for a man . I think the countess should get off her high horse and stop the nonsense of being aristocracy . We don't care in America and they don't care that much in Europe unless you're the Queen or King . Now , Luann is writing a book on etiquette which is supposedly something she knows about but I don't think so . I think she can be rude , mean , obnoxious , and cruel to those of us who aren't on her privileged level . I'll give her respect when the countess deserves it . But last season , I didn't care for Alex and Simon and I'm beginning to now . Maybe they are bit snobs but isn't Luann the biggest of all . Jill calls them weird when she's got gay husband Brad ala Will and Grace in her life . Bethenny has become more real as time goes on in this series . Maybe the break-up with Jason has really matured her , she doesn't need him or anybody else . I don't think he really wanted to marry and have kids all over again . I didn't care for the new housewife and I certainly don't care for Ramona who's becoming more impossible over time . She insulted Luann at a charity even when she was giving dating advice to Bethenny . Luann nearly flipped and almost lost her cool . I won't get any further but I thought it was nice to see that even the countess can get mad .
490834	33913	157996	7.0	Another Holocaust Movie !	Another Holocaust Movie starring Law & Order Sam Waterston ( yes , he can do more ) and Mia Farrow as a Danish couple who help and assist Danish Jews to flee the country to Sweden . Of course , everybody knows the history of the holocaust and those few who assisted . In this story , the Christian Kosters help aid the Danish Jews . It's another story about good Christians who helped the Jews in Europe during a dark time in it's history . I don't think the German Nazis and Gestapo in this film is accurately portrayed . Believe me , they were much more vicious . Denmark was one of the few countries that helped their Jews because they didn't have the same anti-Semitism that other countries including Germany , Austria , POland , Czech , and Russia had at the time according to this film . Denmark should be applauded for it's behavior but the majority of the population were not Jewish or Catholic but Christians . I'm not knocking the story but this film was shown to middle school American children . While it's just another Holocaust movie , it's not as good as Schindler's List or others . It was shown because it was not rated but the children could see it because it lacked the viciousness of usual Holocaust films .
490822	33913	793140	7.0	Mama's Inheritance !	Mama Harper may get another chance at being rich from a dead relative . This time , it's her Uncle who played pirate and ran a boating business on the Ray River . He was quite in his prime in his nineties who was active right until his death . When the family returns from the funeral , Mama Harper is scheduled to go to the will reading on the following day . Her uncle was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ray River but interuppted by a jet-ski-ing woman who at least wore black as she road down the Ray River . Mama gets Petey , her Uncle's beloved bird . He annoys her and the other Harpers as well with his constant babble . When he starts talking about lucky bars of gold , Mama and the gang begin wrecking the house to find their treasure which she felt her uncle could have at least owed her . You can only imagine how this ends up .
490142	33913	29608	7.0	A Tear Jerker !	Barbara Stanwyck was one of America's finest actresses whether on film or television . I don't know much about her stage career but she was always brilliant and unforgettable . In this film , which is one of her most beloved roles is Stella Martin Dallas , a poor woman who marries a rich man and has a daughter , Laurel . Unfortunately , the marriage ends and she leaves the daughter with the father . It's one of those tear-jerking films that you need a box of Kleenex around to wipe the tears . There is no doubt that this role and many others of her long wonderful career allowed her to be one of the finest American actresses around . They remade this film with Bette Midler in the Stella Dallas role but it can't be matched by Stanwyck's beautiful interpretation of a woman that could have be done inadequately by any other actress .
490579	33913	81353	7.0	For the die-hard Popeye fans only !	I am not ashamed to admit it but I love Popeye , the cartoon and the movie starring the amazing Robin Williams as Popeye . He is almost unrecognizable in the role but completely believable . I love Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl because she really does a superb job living up to and beyond my expectations as the ultra-skinny love interest to muscular Popeye . It's like watching old friends . " I'll pay Tuesday for a Hamburger today " was a common statement . Of course , Popeye and Olive Oyl have Brutus as an obstacle to their happiness and almost the loss of Sweet Pea . It's a kind a family film too . It has music and dancing . Okay , it's not the greatest musical film ever made but it's always worth watching again . It reminds me of being 7 years old and seeing this film at the movie theater .
490830	33913	94563	7.0	A Disappointed Series !	Stephen Collins better known from Seventh Heaven and Blythe Danner better known as Gwyneth's mother , played a couple who divorced in New York City . Their family restaurant , Tattingers , is supposed to be one of the classier restaurants for the in-crowd of New Yorkers like Wall Street millionaires , publishers , Broadway stars , movie and television stars . The show was memorable because it was also filmed in New York CIty and was created by the same gang who created St . Elsewhere but you get disappointed because Tattingers has a tough act to follow with the creators of St . Elsewhere who created probably the best drama on television ever . Tattingers needed a lot of work with the writing to make it appeal to broader audience of Americans . Most Americans like myself don't eat at 5 star restaurants but might work in one some day .
490848	33913	92410	7.0	Stupid Plot but a good show !	The show's premise about a young single mother dies leaving orphan Staci Keanan to be raised by two potential fathers who are very opposite of one another . They are played by a former hometown resident Greg Evigan and Paul Reiser . The Judge who put them together is played by the wonderful Florence Stanley . Okay , the plot may have been dumb but something clicked on this show about two very different men who are not gay raising a daughter in New York City . Of course , a simple blood test would determine who the father was but it was more important that it did not matter after awhile . That family can be redefined about people who love and care for each other . The show also had the two fathers date women . Of course , now the show would be about two gay men raising a daughter which would have left the fire out of them trying to get along and live together as a family . Isn't family about people who love each other after all ?
490499	33913	387877	7.0	Good acting in otherwise flawed film !	Don't get me wrong , I have read a lot about the true crime of the black dahlia murder of Elizabeth " Betty " Short . I haven't read James Ellroy's novel centered around the Black Dahlia . Of course , the crime is never solved and remains as infamous as Jack the Ripper in American folklore . There are plenty of suspects and of course , Los Angeles police department was corrupted by the wealth and power of Hollywood moguls . This was not a place for those young aspiring girls like Betty Short to become a movie star but to end in tragedy . Her murder was brutal even compared to this day . The details can make anybody queazy if you don't know or are unaware of them . Anyway , the cast is excellent especially Aaron Eckhart who was in Thank You for Smoking , he turns in a great performance but is overshadowed by his younger on screen professional male partner Josh Harnett . Aaron plays Lee Blanchard , an LAPD cop and boxer , who is married to Scarlet JOhanson's character Kay . She does a pretty good job of making you forget . I didn't care for the lesbian bar scenes because I think there unrealistic and man's fantasy . Let's not forget it's Brian DePalma directing this film . KD Lang has a brief moment as a lesbian bar singer in a pretty risqué sketch . Hilary Swank plays Madeline Limpscott , a woman who looks like the Black DAhlia . She comes from a wealthy prominent family . Her father practically build Hollywood but her family is quite unsavory . Fiona Shaw makes a surprising performance out of such a small role . I know she has an honorary CBE but she's got Irish dame all over her . Madeline's sister , Martha , is played by Macauley Culkin's former wife , Rachel Miner . Funny , I watched her grow up on Guiding Light . Like L . A . Confidential , there are lot of simlarities with the characters and the plots . I wanted Harnett's character Dwight , to ask Madeline why she goes to lesbian haunts when she appears to be straight . Was it just to show a scene in a lesbian nightclub ? There are few more scenes that really risqué involving Elizabeth Short and a blonde teen unknown actress as well . The director seemed to have enjoyed in bringing a lot of lesbian scenes in this movie even if it was unnecessary or had nothing to do with the plot . if you're going to show a lesbian bar of the 1940s , be a little more realistic rather than idealistic to satisfy men's fantasies . I mean weren't the lesbian patrons shocked to see a man in the bar even a policeman without uniform . Now , I know I go on about this issue but since I have read a lot about the black dahlia case , I don't understand why it was overly done in the first place .
489846	33913	84021	7.0	It was alright !	Before I saw the first Grease , me and my neighbor only saw Grease 2 because that's all HBO or Showtime aired at the time . Anyway , it introduced us to Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield . The casting was excellent but they were trying to recreate the magic from the first Grease . I was glad to see some old favorites back like Eve Arden , Didi Conn as Frenchy , Dodie Goodman , Sid Caesar , Alice Ghostley , and new faces like Adrian Zmed , Lorna Luft ( Liza's sister and Judy's daughter ) . There were some dumb scenes like when one of the Pink ladies and one of the guys got together thinking it would be the last . That was a silly medley but you can still watch and laugh . Of course , the plot was silly but it managed to make a somewhat decent sequel to a classic movie . The scene in the bowling alley was funny to watch . Alright , it wasn't the original but we got to see some old friends again .
490298	33913	790191	7.0	A Sweet End to a Memorable Show !	Mama's Family never got the proper recognition that it long deserved as a cult hit . What started out as a family sketch on the Carol Burnett show evolved into something of it's own life . Unfortunately , the sad end of the show was probably because it's executive producer and creator , Joe Hamilton , and former husband of Carol Burnett , would pass away a year or so later . This season was tough because they ran out of ideas . Sadly , I wished that they brought the family together one more time for a reunion before calling it quits but it didn't happen . In this episode and the series finale , the blessed event of Naomi's baby is due to give birth and she is frantic that Vinton won't be there for the event . While Mama gets her house back since Vint and Naomi are moving into their trailer at the mobile home park in town and grandson Bubba will move into the fraternity house at the community college . Still , the baby is always welcome even if it means the end of the show and an era . Mama's Family was the first family that I felt was real . The characters were imperfect and sometimes didn't get along when they were together . They weren't like the other family sitcoms of the era . This show should have stayed in prime time but the network canceled it after two seasons for whatever reasons . In syndication , Mama's Family was queen because it allowed the show to move along without the politics of network television but without the money but it still delighted the fans who miss this show terribly and miss the characters as well .
490642	33913	121022	7.0	Could have had a longer run ?	With a cast that included Penelope Wilton OBE , Gwen Taylor , and Jill Baker as three women with something in common ! They are all involved with the same man . I don't recall seeing him very much . Somehow the three women bond and form an unlikely friendship despite their man . They are all three very different women who range in personalities . The show begins by playing a song by Lakme's Delibes opera . It's quite a poetic song and it sets the mood for this show . It's still an unusual sitcom that aired briefly in the New York City area years ago but I remember it well because of the three actresses who play the women in one man's life . Maybe that's why the show is called screaming because they wanted to scream away from the situation ?
489862	33913	684917	8.0	Vintage Beverlee ! !	Before Beverlee McKinsey returned to daytime in her final long-term role , she had a guest appearance on Remington Steele as Alexis Vanderveer . Beverlee chews up the scenery in the same way that dogs chew bone but she's always fun to watch and enjoy . Even this episode where it showed some of her brilliance as family matriarch and demanding mother . I wished that she would come out of retirement for another stab at acting regardless of the role . With Beverlee , she can make it worth it . Vintage Steele is about Laura's old flame coming to see her and help him with a dead man in the trunk . Who knew in 1982 that it was supposed to be drama ? Laura , Steele , and her ex-boyfriend travel to the wine country where you get vintage in order to solve the mystery . Upon going there , they meet Alexis and her horses . Too bad , Beverlee McKinsey has given up acting and retired . We miss you , Beverlee .
489962	33913	72577	8.0	It's pretty good !	Two's Company has been shown recently on the WLIW in Long Island Thursday Nights after Waiting for God . It's actually a delightful surprise to see Elaine Stritch and Sir Donald Sinden in this show . Elaine was married to British writer during this time . She is so talented in many ways including singing the theme song . She appears to have fun with her character . While the character is an American expatriate , the show sometimes uses it unwisely . I am an American who love British television more than American television . In fact , I watch Waiting for God reruns rather than Friends . After all , Two's Company was produced by London Weekend Television . Sir Donald's Robert plays wonderfully to Elaine Stritch . We should be very proud of Miss Stritch's talent and success . She is still an American treasure from this show .
490388	33913	63141	8.0	One of Vanessa Redgrave's best performances !	Vanessa Redgrave who should be awarded Dame Commander of the British Empire if it was up to me but she declined damehood in 1999 and even regrets accepting the C . B . E . in 1967 . She gives one of her best and memorable performances as the legendary dancer , Isadora Duncan . It is a long and memorable movie . THe best lover in my opinion is the foreign piano lover who is described first by Isadora as " hideous and revolting . " When they finally share a carriage ride , she begins to recognize his inner beauty of another artist . Isadora's life is also tragic with the loss of her two children in a dreadful car accident . This film is really Vanessa Redgrave's vehicle . She drives smoothly from beginning to end . American actress , Cynthia Harris , does a good job in a featured role in this film . So does Jason Robards and others who bring the life to this wonderful creature .
490722	33913	98878	8.0	Better without Rob Morrow !	Rob Morrow as the typical uptight Jewish New York City doctor gets relocated to Cicely , Alaska . The show was filmed around Seattle , Washington . While I love the beauty of Alaska , Morrow's role was nauseating , neurotic , and stereotypical . He hates his assignment . It's too far from everywhere , Seattle is the nearest city . What about Vancouver ? That's where they shoot Men in Trees now . Fortunately , the show's stellar supporting cast like Peg Phillips as the general store owner , Ruth Anne Miller was unforgettable , Cynthia Geary , John Corbett became a longtime Seattle resident , John Corbin , Janine Turner , and other cast members loved the locale of their show so much that they based themselves there . Who wouldn't love Seattle and the Snohomish Mountains or Alaska ? Now they can be seen on DVD , season by season . But for several seasons , Monday night was the place to be to curl and watch Northern Exposure .
490620	33913	640597	8.0	See how Mama handles obscene !	Naomi Harper is doing her best to win as most friendly checker at Food Circus where she works . She might be too friendly to receive such an award . Anyway with the good news , she receives obscene telephone calls asking for her . The family's happiness is short-lived with these interrupting phone calls . She doesn't know would be calling her with such filth . Of course , the family including Mama and Aunt Fran and even Vint criticize her manner of dressing and friendliness like she warranted such vile phone calls . Buzz and Sonja suggest that they record but they get the wrong button and out comes Willie Nelson's On the Road Again . While everybody is blaming Naomi for the phone calls , the caller appears to be turning the same filth on Mama , Aunt Fran , and Vint .
489958	33913	404666	8.0	They're not so bad parents !	As somebody who always wanted to become an actress , I am now glad that my parents were never show business . I feel sorry for most of these families . I can see Jordan Moseley can become a child star herself . She is talented and cute enough . She seems to enjoy the business whether it's a guest appearance and makes the most of it . She is the only one of the six families that I have any hope for to succeed in this tough business . Now for the others , I feel sorry for Emily Tye at four years old to spend her free time in rehearsals , shopping , and practicing for the next competition . The tanning bothered me too . Doesn't her mother know about the possibility of skin cancer ? Emily appears unhappy doing all of this . She is the Jon Benet Ramsey . There is even physical similarities to Emily too . She has spent her short life in beauty pageants . That money could have been used for her college fund . The Tyes also have another son but he appears forgotten most of the time . For Jordan Barron and her family , I would recommend returning to Colorado and taking acting lessons out there . While I don't see any talent from Jordan , she should focus everything in her athleticism and pursuing college scholarships to study acting if she so desires . She was talking about making it big but her chances are impossible . She does not have the talent nor the natural drive to become an actress . I feel sorry for her and her mother . I think they should return home and pursue it locally rather than in Los Angeles . I feel sorry for Shane and his mother but not so much . His mother is older and has her own history of coaching dancers . I think his mother has genuine feelings about her son's abilities . His mother , Debbie , is also more mature and should be hired as somebody's manager too . I think no matter what happens to Shane , he will do fine . As for the Nutters , I have a lot to say and it's not pleasant . I feel sorry for Duncan Nutter . I don't think he realizes his mistakes but he has a wonderful wife , Cindy , who is a Saint to do all of this . If Duncan wants to become a stage actor with his kids , they can go back to Vermont and build a theatre on their property . After watching Bravo , I am sure people would like to meet them . The best stage actors in the world call their stage as their home . With his seven children , I think they would be better served if they returned home and built a stage to express their talents . Now , these are my suggestions for a better life . I don't think the Nutters are very happy in New York City . Cindy Nutter is a saint who tolerates Duncan Nutter so much that she must love him . After all , they have seven children . She enjoys teaching . Anyway , I watched the follow-up special and I was amused by it all . I don't think the families knew what they were getting into . The Nutters aren't so bad neither Jordan whose mother could be an actress herself and has made the way to management in her company . They didn't take themselves so seriously but I think we did . Oh well , they tried to make in the business . When I look at those who have made it , I can't believe they would let their daughters dress that way or let their sons to be pawns as well . At least these parents never forced so much on their kids . I mean at least they are encouraging them to pursue their dreams . Why shouldn't they aim to be the next Jessica Simpson ? Justin Timberlake ? etc . They make lots of money and look like they have a lot of fun being rich and famous . But I wish these families aimed at getting their kids studying the classics and singing the classics rather than the contemporary music today and drama today .
490059	33913	109458	8.0	A great match for Shatner and Falk again	For Columbo fans , William Shatner plays the controlling Fielding Chase who kills a man who can separate him from his adoptive daughter played wonderfully by Molly Hagen . The key to solving the case is as fascinating as the actual murder . Columbo figures out who done it but how does he catch him . As in any Columbo feature , all the crimes are solved by one loose thread or link . It is nice to see Three's Company Richard Kline as his daughter's friend and literary agent . William Shatner plays Fielding Chase as the overly protective suffocating surrogate father to Molly Hagen's character in this film . It is a believable one and fun to watch anyway . Like I said , I will watch Columbo all the time . I am waiting for the Columbo Cable Channel .
490695	33913	109445	8.0	What you don't expect is how good and true this can be ?	Clerks is by far one of the most innovative films for the nineties . Before Sopranos claimed New Jersey , Clerks shows another side to the Garden State . The convenience store is one of thousands in our state . You can't go for a mile without seeing one of them or another . This convenience store has quirky cast of regular characters and two clerks bored out of their mind to work a Saturday with breaks for a hockey game on the roof and a break for a wake of an ex-girlfriend . The cast is charming and interesting to watch anyway . I admire Marilyn Ghigliotti's performance as memorable . She is a Jersey Girl through and through . Clerks shows a Jersey kind of life to the world .
490736	33913	1408764	8.0	Well , they asked for it , didn't they ?	Ramona and Mario have been trying to get Jill in a tennis re-match for whatever reasons . Finally , Jill has a pro-tennis player who gets injured so she gets a replacement , Simon , after Bethenny suggests him . Jill and Simon practice once but Simon's still flu-ridden but still plays okay . The look on Ramona's face is truly priceless as Simon takes the court . It was a well-kept secret until that moment . Ramona and Mario had been had by Jill and they felt cheated . For several episodes now , Mario and Ramona have been goading Jill into a silly rematch . Why not pick the one person that Ramona has a beef with in the first place ? Okay , I won't say who played badly but it was a hollow victory as Jill points out .
489800	33913	95889	8.0	In Memory of Heather O'Rourke !	This film would have been tossed away if it wasn't for the fact that this film was Heather O'Rourke's last appearance before her tragic death . Heather will always be remembered as Carol Anne Freeling despite her many roles on television and film . The movie is dedicated in her memory because she was the heart and soul of the Poltergeist trilogy . This movie was a weak sequel but the last in a series . Carol Anne is sent to live in Chicago with her uncle played by Tom Skerritt and aunt played by Nancy Allen . She also has a cousin played by Lara Flynn Boyle who was unknown at the time of this film . I remember watching the director discuss for a documentary about the making of Poltergeist III . I think Heather's death overshadowed the movie's goal . He said he will never forget being a pallbearer at her funeral . We can only imagine what might have been for Heather's career . I can't forget Zelda Rubenstein as the psychic who travels to Chicago to save Carol Anne .
490138	33913	95953	8.0	Hoffman and Cruise ! A Sweet Dream Come True !	This film was the first time that I heard of autism . Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as autistic Raymond Babbitt who was kept away from his younger brother , Charlie , played brilliantly by Tom Cruise . The film is about the brothers who travel to Los Angeles from Ohio and how they bond over the journey despite Raymond's complete need for structure including a schedule including People's Court , The Price is Right , and his genius for numbers which gives his younger brother a better idea . I don't know much about autism so I'm not going to criticize Hoffman's portrayal which has been joked around a bit much like the repetition of his speech . The film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards along with director Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman for his second Best Actor Oscar . I still think the film's superior but I'm not crazy about it .
490420	33913	68069	8.0	If you go to England , you should watch British Soaps !	I like Emmerdale . Since I live in America , it is hard for me to get shows like East Enders , COronation Street , Emmerdale and other British soaps . Emmerdale has been around as long I have been alive . I have watched it a couple times . But I am an avid American soap watcher , the main difference between British and American soaps is that British soaps look more realistic with people that look like they are your neighbors . The show could use better writing but I can't say much more since I only watched a few episodes . When you go to England , you should watch Emmerdale , East Enders , and Coronation Street which are the main soaps known to me . Emmerdale is set in Northern England around Leeds . The cast especially the Tates and Patsy Kensit playing a vixen is worth watching . The soaps are only 25 minutes . Unlike American soaps , where are actors and actresses looked like they were plucked from modeling catalogs . British actors and actresses look the role . In fact , Sir Ian McKellen appeared in Coronation Street for 10 episodes last year by his choice . Emmerdale is worth watching along with Corrie and East Enders . My big problem with the shows is the lack of attention to the veteran actors and actresses who have been on for years . Except for Patsy Kensit , I wasn't sure about the others in the show but it's worth watching anyway .
489993	33913	441051	8.0	Overall , it's funny now scream your heads off !	One British woman , Catherine Tate , is multi-talented enough to play several roles in her titled show including the woman is not drunk enough to find her date attractive enough , or the woman who screams at anything because she is easily scared , then there is the couple of new parents with a sleeping baby who won't get out of the car for the mother's birthday party because the baby has finally fallen asleep and don't want to risk the sound of waking her up . Also , there is the couple of women who work in an office cubicle where she keeps asking her to guess how much whether it's weight or money . Catherine Tate might be a new face but she is somebody to watch out for in the future . She's very talented and capable of maintaining a sense of humor throughout the program even being unrecognizable . She does a fabulous job at showing off her craft of British comedy . Now if we can only get it in America .
490766	33913	86793	8.0	When it was good , it was great but when it was bad , it got worse !	Santa Barbara came on with the hopes of changing the daytime industry and it did to many respects . THe Dobsons should be applauded for their soap . Sadly , Santa Barbara was on NBC which does not care for it's daytime audience . As an Another WOrld fan , I can say that network does not show the respect of daytime drama audiences by canceling one of it's soaps . Santa Barbara tried to be like other soaps just when it came out but it didn't work . Then , they brought together Cruz and Eden played by A Martinez and Marcy Walker . They were very good together . The casting was beyond to describe . The cast included Dame Judith Anderson , Janis Paige , Nicolas Coaster ( a soap vet to say the least ) , Sydney Penney , Nancy Lee Grahn , Louise Sorel , Jed Allan , Jane McConnell , and the list just goes on . When you are a favorite of Jill Farren Phelps , you become quite active on the show . Just to say that Grahn and Allan both joined General HOspital since Santa Barbara . The writing was witty and weird , brilliant and sometimes sloppy at the height of Santa Barbara's fame . But sadly , this show became a casualty of daytime's losing audience . Most people don't stay at home during the days like they used too . There are daytime audiences like me willing to tape while at work . I'll just wonder what it might have been if Santa Barbara had been allowed to grow old and gracefully . Santa Barbara won't be forgotten anytime soon . We still have a bit of it on General HOspital .
490791	33913	346869	8.0	Finally the Untold Story !	We all knew about Different Strokes mostly about the kids of Different Strokes . Dana Plato's fade into obscurity did not help her substance abuse problems or her alcoholism . She lost custody of her son or relinquished him because she couldn't take care of him . She couldn't take care of herself . So it was no surprised that she would die so young . It was heartbreaking when Conrad Bain said that Dana was happy to have a baby because then she wouldn't be alone anymore . She wasn't alone . Everybody who was a fan loved her as Kimberly Drummond , the pretty , smart , girl from the show but her real life was from perfect or close to it . For Todd Bridges , he nearly went to prison for a crime that he didn't commit . Luckily , Johnnie Cochrane defended him and he was released . Todd has his own share of problems including an abusive father and his own substance abuse problems . Gary Coleman who became the most famous probably fared the best in comparison to Todd and Dana . Gary never recovered from his Arnold Jackson image to gain more acting jobs . His publicized legal fights with his own parents is heartbreaking because they need each other as a family . Even now , the Colemans are still together but without Gary in the picture . I hate seeing working as a security guard . It just seems unreal . Hollywood must not forget the children like Dana , Todd , and Gary and stop tossing them aside like garbage . There were questions that I would have liked answered like why they switched MRs . Drummonds from Dixie Carter to Mary Ann Mobley ( I liked them both ) but didn't see the need for it or the maids . We know that Charlotte Rae took Mrs . Edna Garrett to Facts of Life . Then there was Nedra Volz and Mary Jo Catlett who took over that job .
490078	33913	64381	8.0	Philip Roth at his best !	I have been doing a lot of research on the author , Philip Roth , who wrote Goodbye , Columbus . Unfortunately , I am disappointed that it was set in the Bronx , New York and not Newark , New Jersey and that Westchester County replaced posh , upscale Livingston , New Jersey . What makes Roth special is that he really is a New Jersey writer even though he has lived in Connecticut for decades . Unfortunately , the story does not lose any of it's original impact as it was written in his novella . Richard Benjamin and Ali McGraw are excellent as Neil and Brenda . Neil Klugman , the Jewish librarian from the Bronx , and Brenda , the Jewish girl from Westchester , who get together . The relationship is believable at times while Neil is from the wrong side of the tracks so to speak while Brenda's family is upscale . Just because they are both Jewish doesn't mean that they don't have their share of problems . Jack Klugman and Nan Martin are perfect as Brenda's parents . The film would have been better or more authentic if it was set in Newark and Livingston rather than the Bronx and Westchester but what's done is done . I hope next time that they will take the time to film where it is set . It's not set that far from New York City anyway .
490333	33913	320053	8.0	Save Life with Bonnie !	Life with Bonnie is a show worth saving from cancellation . It has a great cast with the great Bonnie Hunt , talented David Alan Grier , hunky Mark Derwin , and the wonderful Marianne Meulleruex . The other supporting cast members are also worth mentioning especially Holly . The supporting cast is an excellent ensemble . This show is an ensemble show with each actor doing excellent work . Like the show's theme , it is old fashioned wholesome comedy . It would be a terrible shame for ABC to allow this show to be cancelled after two seasons on the air . I hope some network will come and save this show from permanent cancellation . ABC does not know what it has until it's gone permanently . Until Hope & Faith came on , Bonnie's show was the Friday night anchor for wholesome family comedies . Bonnie Hunt is one of the nicest people in Hollywood . She has reunited with Mark and Marianne Meullereux who worked with her previously in other shows . I just can't understand why this show can't survive after all . Bonnie Hunt has been nominated for Golden Globe Award . While she is in the category with cast members of Sex in the City , she stands out for being wholesome , clean , wonderfully charming , and delightful to watch . Her show has garnered emmy nominations for Jonathan Winters and David Duchovny . She is a giving person . I have noticed she always sets her shows in Chicago as her main setting . I enjoyed the recent episodes with David Alan Grier living in the house with him . I am sorry that this show is going . I wish ABC reconsider ! My best wishes to Bonnie Hunt and to everybody else in the cast and crew !
490696	33913	352565	8.0	You go , girl .	Martha Inc . is actually worth watching to see Cybill Shepherd's take on the character . She really delves into the role and begins to show a sympathetic and vulnerable side to her . Sure , she's pretty and definitely intelligent , perhaps a genius . She worked Wall Street and modeled her way through College . She got married and had a daughter but domestic bliss was never enough for Martha . She wanted more and more in time . She became a successful Connecticut caterer . Even though she won't admit it , she is born and bred in New Jersey to Polish born Parents who immigrated to America . She was brought up in a large ethnic family rather than the small waspy family in Connecticut . Maybe Martha was no great wife or mother but she is creative and brilliant enough to succeed in a man's world . She has done it with class and brilliance . This movie does portray the messy divorce and the affair that broke up this longtime union . Martha may not have best people personilaty but just compare her to Barbra Streisand who is far more difficult . Martha is a perfectionist but brilliant and creative enough to establish herself as a household name . This success always comes with such sacrifice like a marriage and an estranged relationship with her daughter . Most men have often done this but why does it bother people when it is a woman ? You go girl , Martha .
490197	33913	209037	8.0	Everybody's A Star in This Dutch Film Classic !	I don't know much about the Dutch language but the film is based on a young girl who aspires to become a singer much like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera or others . I don't know . Today's young singers are tomorrow's Tiffanys . I could tell you that it's modern and the story is done beautifully with great acting , writing , and directing . It's a modern fairy tale story with a fairy tale ending . The cast is great but I don't know any of them because I don't know much about Dutch actors and actresses . Anyway , I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film Award and won several awards . It does it's best to show the human involvement and desire to be more than average .
489985	33913	112095	8.0	One of the better sitcoms !	I really miss Newsradio because it was a great cast of eccentric characters and writers who knew how to write . The cast included Phil Hartman who was better known for his roles on Saturday Night Live during this tenure . He was a comic genius and sorely missed by his fans . The other cast members included Canada's Dave Foley from Kids in the Hall , Vicki Lewis as the useless secretary , Maura Tierney as the serious , intelligent and love interest of Dave's character . The cast also featured Stephen Root , an underrated actor , Joe Rogan , Andy Dick , Khandi Alexander , etc . The show's eccentric characters worked well together . When Phil's real life tragic death occurred , the cast and crew worked to remember him fondly and brought in fellow Saturday Night Live alum and close friend of Phil's , Jon Lovitz to replace the void . Of course , the show lasted a year . Much like another NBC sitcom , the show never truly recovered emotionally and maybe the audience couldn't get past it . We did accept and love Jon not as Phil's replacement .
490539	33913	81856	8.0	The Show of the 1980s !	Dynasty was the show of the decade . What a cast that included the wonderful John Forsythe playing the attractive , mature , wealthy and lovable billionaire Blake Carrington . His first wife was played deliciously by Joan Collins ( Make her Dame please ) . His second wife was played by Linda Evans who played Krystle . Who could forget those cat fights between Krystle and Alexis ? or the other cast members like Emma Samms replacing Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon Carrington . The show explored serious topics like homosexuality and included Steven Carrington as the homosexual in the show . I thought they really did a very good job in explaining homosexuality without overdoing it and insulting the audience . The season finales were always worth mentioning like the shooting at a wedding in Moldova ( fictional country ) .
489725	33913	105604	8.0	Dennehy makes this role his !	I'm sure Brian Dennehy must have hated doing this role portraying sadistic , cruel serial killer , John Wayne Gacy . In this film version of the events that led to his capture and the revelations of the thirty plus lives that he tortured and murdered and kept as souvenirs to remember . Dennehy gives a performance that is both riveting and frightening and yet we can't wait to see what he does next . Especially when he's trapped by the law and being followed everywhere , still trapped in the closet , he refuses to describe himself as homosexual . Gacy was truly a hated individual who nobody missed now or ever . Dennehy deserves an Emmy for his portrayal because he tries to bring a heart to a heartless villain of a character . In reality , Gacy was the bogeyman that we children feared . Margot Kidder is memorable as the psychic who sees the horror at the home . THe mini-series is worth watching to see a great American actor like Dennehy turn this role into a winner .
490411	33913	870111	9.0	It Should Be Frank's Oscar !	If I was a voting member of the academy , I would vote for Frank Langella as Best Actor for his performance as the disgraced president Richard Nixon . I also think Michael Sheen OBE should have been nominated as well but he would easily won in the supporting actor category playing Sir David Frost OBE . Both Frost and his producer , John Birt , were knighted by the Queen . I didn't like the Reston character very much and I have read one of his books on Rev . Jim Jones . Langella and Sheen performed the same roles on Broadway and the West End in London . They did a brilliant job and were both equally brilliant in their roles . I never thought that I would have sympathies for the former disgraced president but I did . I felt Langella brought the role of Nixon from a caricature into a full-fledged multi-dimensional human being . Of course , the President is a human being although they were elected to the highest office in the country . This film is one of the best that I have seen but I would have liked to have seen Nixon's interaction with underused Patty McCormack who plays his devoted and dedicated wife , Patricia .
490508	33913	63297	9.0	A Quality Production but not the costumes !	THere are three British dames in this film adaptation : Dame Judi Dench , Dame Diana Rigg and Dame Helen Mirren . While the cast is outstandingly directed by Sir Peter Hall , the costumes appear to be weak and cheaply made . When Titania played by Dame Judi Dench kisses a horses ' behind , you can see his eyes . The costumers dressed Titania as a green fairy which was just painted on like silly . The William Shakespeare play is a festive comedy for the light-hearted and entertainment of its audience . It's not an expensive production but it's worth watching to see three Dames in their younger days . Everybody in the cast has been part of the Royal Shakespeare Company and are veteran actors by now . THe play does entertain and I can poke fun at the cheap costumes and lack of expense towards the production . It's nice to see Dame Judi Dench before she was ever a Dame . Not even an O . B . E . in this 1968 production . She appears to enjoy playing the role . Dame Helen Mirren is also cast as the young Helena who seeks to be in love . I probably got the names wrong but it's Shakespeare , who can remember ?
489763	33913	74328	9.0	A Decent Columbo	William Shatner is best known as Captain James T . Kirk from his Star Trek days . Now he is considered one of Canada and America's finest actors on television to date in his role as Denny Krane on the ABC hit drama , Boston Legal , with Emmy winners , Candice Bergen and James Spader . Anyway he plays an actor who kills his agent rather than be blackmailed by her . The best and most memorable moments in this episode are between Peter Falk and William Shatner's characters . Later , William Shatner guests again and of course as the prime suspect . But Columbo is always entertaining whether by meeting people in the entertainment industry or anywhere else , he always takes an interest in them and this episode is no different .
490125	33913	64886	9.0	One of the Most Surprising Comedic Films with a Western Flavor !	I have to say that I was surprised about how much I liked the film . William Faulkner ( American Nobel Prizewinner ) wrote " The Reivers . " The story is about a boy , Lucius , and Boone played by Steve McQueen . They take the 1905 car that Boone promised not to take out for a joyride while his bosses were away at a family funeral . Boone , Lucius , and an African American co-worker who I forget his name but sneaks aboard the car on the way to Memphis to visit friends like Miss Corey played by Sharon Farrell and the brothel's matron , Miss Reba , played by the wonderfully talented Ruth White who died shortly after the film . The film is more of a mix of comedy and drama . There is the story of the 1905 yellow car and a horse and about horse-racing with Lucius in the saddle . There are some serious moments like Lucius discovering that he is staying at brothel and Miss Corey who he grows to bond with .
490315	33913	97958	9.0	Still one of my favorites Christmas films ! Flaws and all !	I love the Griswolds and have since I first saw their European Vacation film . I later saw the original film . Anyway , this film is great about Clark's ideal Christmas holiday with the family around . The only problem is that nothing ever goes right for him just like his vacations . Anyway , a great cast including Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as the Griswolds . The kids are played by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki . THe visiting family members are played by Doris Roberts , John Randolph , Diane Ladd , and E . G . Marshall . You can't forget Cousin Eddie played by Randy Quaid and his wife Kathryn played by Miriam Flynn . The film is always a treat around the Holiday season . It reminds us that no family is perfect and problems often arise . As John Randolph's character , Mr . Griswold replies " I had help from Jack Daniels . " Of course , I can't forget Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing the snobby yuppie neighbor . I also liked watching Bill Hickey and Mae Questal as the older family relatives who come on Christmas Eve . It's always worth the laughs .
489909	33913	217148	9.0	The Spirituals of Harlem Come Alive !	There is no real story here but vignettes of monologues regarding African American history filled with songs , dance , and plenty of heart . The cast includes the wonderful Lynne Thigpen , Cleavon Derricks , and Reginald Veljohnson ( Family Matters ) and others . It was directed by Dirty Dancing director , Emile Ardolino . At times , it is a funeral scene or the disco in Harlem . The cast is first rate and the writing is somewhat disconnected . At times , it can be somber and at others as glim and hopeful and full of joy . This Broadway Theater Archives production like many often have that staged feeling because it's done on stage but we do hear an audience reaction which is positive . The ensemble cast never has one character but they have many and it's hard not to notice their costumes and hairstyles of the seventies but I still recommend it because it can appeal to the wide audiences regardless of race , gender , religion or sexual orientation .
490686	33913	694432	9.0	God Bless George !	This show was the first of hundreds which was hosted by none other than George Carlin . The sketches were done with the not for ready prime time players . George never appeared in them but he was there to introduce the two musical performers , Billy Preston and Janis Ian who each performed twice themselves . Despite the initial premise , George performed his baseball-football comparisons to the laughter of an audience who should be so lucky to have attended the first night of many on live television . The show was never at outlandish as it is now . The humor was from within . It was nice to see the original players who all became stars on their own . The show evolved and changed . Janis Ian , an American folk singer , sang beautifully and poetically the second time around while Billy Preston was legendary in his performance . It showed that the show took chances in bringing the popular and unpopular performers who should be famous .
489842	33913	379623	9.0	Stop Being Serious and Start Having Fun !	Ellen DeGeneres is one of the best known lesbian talk show hostesses around . That's because she does not use her show to preach or force people to accept her lifestyle . Her show has fans that range from conservative Christians to left wing liberals like myself who do appreciate that Ellen uses her show for good rather than protesting . I think that's why she went away . She allowed her sexual orientation to define her rather than having her own identity . I think she's better than that because she does admit to it upfront . Audiences do want honesty and truthfulness . They don't care about it but they don't want to be deceived or lied too . It's better to be clean and upfront about her personal life especially if you are doing a television show like this . While I think she's secured a niche in daytime television , she uses her comedic humor to poke fun as life in general . I think she's best when she's non-political because we already have enough politics for the next year with this 2008 election . I don't understand why she's winning Emmys because even though she's great most of the time . The show's momentum has passed . It can be silly , serious , and straightforward at times . She dances in the beginning because we don't get enough of it . Ellen might be a great role model for lots of confused teens out there but she is seen as a great role model for all of us because we don't have to grow up and stop having fun . I think that's what the message of her show is about , stop being serious and having fun .
489899	33913	71315	9.0	Except for the Ending , this is a classic film !	This film follows Roman Polanski's mindset . By the time , he directed Chinatown , Polanski had survived the Holocaust in Poland and survived the Manson trial . I know Polanski is guilty of molesting a young girl and fled the country . Those events occurred after this film . For the record , Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Jake , a man with a conscious . Fay Dunaway is brilliant as Mrs . Mulray and the legendary John Huston acting as her father is bone-chilling . The film is the story about life in Los Angeles during the great depression when it was nothing at the time before all the development . It's hard to believe that Los Angeles was once a small town that prospered into the entertainment capital of the world . It has become one of the world's priciest places to live in or around . The story is well-known especially about the relationship between Mrs . Mulray and her father , Mr . Cross . But in 1974 , they never would have revealed such truths . After all , Huston plays a powerful wealthy businessman and investor . I am giving it a nine because I dislike the ending . It's chilling for me to see the wrong person to be killed and another character on the way to be victimized .
489851	33913	115291	9.0	Oh Canada !	I would love to see more comedies out of Canada . Most of today's American comedies are downright dumbed down to the audience of the young and the restless . Anyway , I was surprised that I actually enjoyed watching this show mixed in with the British comedies on NJN . I love Canada . I was watching the episode which was well-written about pretty boy anchorman who enjoys doing stories on pets in Kabul . I love his school teacher who said that he had a great voice and looked great enough to be doing something that wouldn't require too much thinking or intelligence . Anyway , this anchorman gets kidnapped while on assignment . The ransom was 2 million American dollars not Canadian but it was brought down to 1700 Canadian dollars because the reporter captured wasn't anybody worth keeping . Of course , his boss was on the shortlist for an Order of Canada . If you don't know what the Order of Canada is , it's like the Order of the British Empire or Order of Australia with no knights or dames . Well the boss was on the shortlist until his anchorman gets kidnapped and he gets bumped . By the time the shortlist comes out after Jim Walcott's unflattering tapes of his past surface and he gets bumped off . Who gets on the list is the substitute female anchor . It's all political but it shouldn't be in the Order of Canada . Oh well , God Bless Canada .
490720	33913	410966	9.0	The Answer to Our Prayers !	The Blue Collar Comedy Tour has launched a successful comedy show not filmed in New York or Hollywood but in Atlanta , Georgia at a local theater . Sadly , the yuppies in New York and Hollywood don't understand the rest of the country . We're not all ignorant , bigoted blue collar trailer trash as the elite might think about when it comes to audiences . The reason that these comedians have become famous and rich without losing their touch with middle America . I've loved blue collar humor because I grew up in working class union community . I don't know what country clubs are like nor do I plan to join one . The Blue Collar TV show is the answer to our prayers when we feel down about our personal , financial situation . At least , we can expect to see these guys around a lot more making fun of themselves , their families , friends , and of course , it's audience without malice .
490773	33913	63518	9.0	The near perfect adaptation of Shakespeare's classic !	This adaptation is probably the finest involving Romeo and Juliet . Olivia Hussey is superb and so is the young Michael York as Tybalt . Milo Shea plays the friar who helps Romeo and Juliet . It's a tragedy . We all know the story but after viewing it in my high school days , I can't imagine a better film to show adolescents about Romeo and Juliet who were doomed from the beginning . The story of Romeo and Juliet is as old as time . The director does a superb job in recreating the magic , fire , and romance on screen in this film . We believe that we are transformed into their world of Verona , Italy . After seeing this film many times , I tried to watch other adaptations but anything fails in comparison to this classic Romeo and Juliet . The costumes are precise and beautiful . The scenery is lovely and of course the acting is all done seriously and brilliant at the same time . This film deserved it's nominations and awards . It's not easy to take Shakespeare and make it unforgettable but the director has sure done his job .
490747	33913	97082	9.0	Very Entertaining !	Soap stars Ian Buchanan from General Hospital and the always beautiful Deirdre Hall from Days of Our Lives are involved in a disappearance and possible murder of a publisher . Of course , this brings a slew of much needed publicity for a starving magazine . Gigi Rice has a role as well . It's a familiar story with Ian playing a British Hugh Hefner style younger man and his empire in financial ruins . His partner is played by the beautiful Deidre Hall ( she hasn't aged in years ) wants out of the business . Of course , the motive is about money . Columbo episodes try to use simple motives rather than complex and the crimes are always pretty simply done whether it is done with a gun . We are never truly left with a gruesome crime scene in Columbo episodes and that's a good thing because Columbo has always been light-hearted at heart and his interactions with the prime suspect is always fascinating . When he thinks he's wrong , he's not .
490172	33913	970525	9.0	An Excellent Short Film !	The acting is above average . I liked April Nicholson playing Mrs . Wright , the grieving mother , and the young man who played an aspiring reporter . The young man's role is that he just lost his mother and is on assignment to ask a grieving mother about pictures of her dead son from a car accident . There is a third character , Tamara , who is like a mentor to the journalist . The cast does a fine job in their performances and I wish them well for the future . The film has a surprising twist without an explanation which is why I am only giving it a nine . The film is short enough to play this story and three characters is defined very quickly . I think they should be proud of this short film but I want to ask what really happened at the end . I am wondering what happened if at all . I think that is what the director wants us to do and discuss what happened .
490498	33913	80319	10.0	So Funny that you'll cry laughing !	What a combination of great talent in this cast and that includes Oscar nominees Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton with 2-time Oscar winner Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman playing their despicable boss . Remember when typewriters were the computers of our time and on every office desktop imaginable . Anyway , I liked Peggy Pope and Marian Mercer as well but you can't top Tomlin as divorced mother of four Viola , Dolly's Doralee happily married to a country singer , and Jane's Judy who is not always goody two shoes . The three women become friends and smoke a joint after their boss played brilliantly by Dabney Coleman . I think the cast just had such a grand old time making this movie that there is still talk of a reunion and the four major cast members reunited last year for Jane's charity benefit in Atlanta , Georgia . I loved the scenes where they imagined giving Hart played by Coleman , a taste of his own medicine . The kidnapping is also worth watching as well . I can't forget Sterling Hayden . This comedy is one of the all-time classic comedies especially about working environments and women's rights . When these three women take charge , they make changes that brought differences to the working place where their employees became better people which means happier employees . I guarantee if you are an employer and you want a productive environment , you have to have a happy working staff regardless of the cost .
490537	33913	418689	10.0	Restores my Faith in American Cinema !	I read the book a couple of years ago . When I was watching in the film in the smaller theater of the cinema , I kept remembering the names like Strank , Franklin Sousley , Iggy , James Bradley , Hank Hansen , Rene Gagon , and of course Ira Hayes . The movie can only do so much that the book is a great resource for learning more about Ira's life especially losing siblings at an early age . I remember Franklin was from Kentucky and his mother's name was Goldie Price Sousley Mitchell . Of course , James Bradley's son learns his father's life only before it's too late . I have to say that this film should be a front-runner for the Academy Awards easily . I predict Ryan Phillipe will get a Best Actor nomination but I don't think he would win . I think Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach should get Best Supporting Actor nominations . Judith Ivey was on screen for only a few short minutes . Clint Eastwood proves that he can direct something as emotionally challenging as Million Dollar Baby and something as riveting and complicated as the Flag Raising at Iwo Jima . I recommend to anybody who is interested in history to see this film and stay until the credits have finished rolling because you see the original photos of the men next to the actor's name and photos from Joe Rosenthal who just died recently . I hope he saw this film and gave his approval . The flag raisers of Iwo Jimo never considered themselves heroes , it was the public and press . They became icons and legends . Melanie Lynskey as a supporting role as Rene's girlfriend / fiancé / wife in the film . She is worth watching for in the future . This film is a must see on your to do list . Screenplay adapter , Paul Haggis ( Crash Oscar Winner ) and Clint Eastwood are going to win more Oscars to add to their crowded mantelpiece .
490440	33913	120815	10.0	Spielberg's best film to date !	I first saw this film in the movie theater . The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind . It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film . You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor , Tom Hanks , Matt Damon , Paul Giamati , one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role . This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance . SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time , the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened . You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see . HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best . I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home . I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film . The script was superb , the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date . It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level . he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love , there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film . Sorry , Shakespeare in Love !
490017	33913	640600	10.0	Think Positive !	Carol Burnett delivers her best performance as the miserable Eunice Harper Higgins in this episode . When her nephew Buzz comes in with news and help about the power of positive thinking in an audiotape , Eunice reluctantly buys a tape player and listens to it . Believing in the tape's message , she manages to get a small part in the local play . Eunice has never been happier nor has Mama ever been suspicious about her daughter's change even though it's far more positive . When Mama attends the rehearsal with Eunice , she sees that her daughter is getting stepped on by an over-possessive actress Sally played by Gloria DeHaven . There is a scene that is unforgettable in the Pepperpot Playhouse that I won't get into . We do see a bit of Ed Higgins played by the late Harvey Korman .

They find out that the teacher Bambi offers a few steps and leaves . They learn that insurance companies think tap-dancing senior ladies are a liability .

490383	33913	382932	10.0	Probably the Best Film if Not most Entertaining of 2007 !	Ratatouile is one of those films than can entertain children as well as adults . It's smart , beautifully crafted in animation . The story of a Rat who aspires to be a great French chef like Gusteau , a fictional male Julia Child . He gets caught up watching Gusteau as he learns of his death from television where the resident of the house , an old French lady with a gun , goes literally ballistic when she sees two mice . She blows the ceiling only to discover a scene like in Williard or Ben about a thousand rats living above her . Horrified , she begins shooting like Dick Cheney on vacation . She doesn't stop once they leave her house which almost destroyed . She goes right on separating the main character rat and his family and friends . He begins talking to Gusteau in his cookbook which he uses as a life raft away from the crazy lady with a rifle actually . Slowly , he finds himself at Gusteau's restaurant and slowly warms up to the aspiring human chef .
490418	33913	413845	10.0	The Best Film of 2005 !	I saw a few films this year but this documentary about the rise and fall of Enron is far more important than anything out there today including Brokeback Mountain . This film provides insight into an American tragedy . The thoughts and opinions and observations of reporters , businessmen , businesswomen , and everybody involved had me glued to the screen . Enron had all the power , influence , and energy to make a lot of money but the truth was that they flawed by building their bridges too high . THe money was not there and there was a lot of talk but little financial return . The California Energy Crisis was a big sign of what was the beginning of the end . Ken Lay and his men were arrogant , selfish , and corrupted by the power of money . They did not notice that money was going out but not coming in like they had planned . They sold a lot of Brooklyn Bridges to anybody gullible enough to believe them . Yet , they had powerful friends both President George Bush Senior and Junior and Dick Cheney as well . When the coast came clear , Enron's tragic tale of greed and lies became crystal clear to those who worked so hard in the Enron Dream . Thousands of employees lost their pensions by buying into the Enron Dream only to turn up broke and crying poverty . I cry for those employees who believed in their company and the dream of Enron . Sadly , this movie does not do enough to enlighten its audience about the plight of the average Enron employee . We see the top of the heap and those who aided knowingly and unknowingly in it's downfall . I pray for those Enron employees who are working 2 or 3 jobs to make up their loss . God Bless You .
490465	33913	250838	10.0	It answered so many questions about 1900	I really can't recommend this documentary and experiment enough . It is really entertaining and brilliantly done to help us understand life in 1900 . I found the Bowlers as a challenging adventurous family who was willing to undertake this difficult project . Mrs . Bowler is a remarkable woman who was wonderful . Her twin daughters passed time by creating a little theatre in their home . What she missed surprised me the most ? They did not complain about the television , radio , telephone , or computer , almost necessary essentials in our times . Life was tough in Victorian times by their experience . I can't thank them enough for their efforts of three months as a Victorian family .
490472	33913	98945	10.0	Don't Wait Much Longer !	One of the funniest shows to come out of England in the nineties , it has a terrific cast of veteran television and stage players . It's funny and timeless comedy with a bit of slapstick humor and a polished verbal English wit . The wonderful relationship between atheist feminist single Diana and the widowed Tom Ballard is fascinating to watch unlike most relationships , they get better when they're together than apart . Tom's boring son , Jeffrey , can bore anyone to death but he is in a marriage to unfaithful , drunk , and pill popper , Marion , who despises and resents Diana as a threat to their inheritance . The cast includes another heterosexual relationship between old maid plain Jane and the Bayview manager , Harvey Nigel Bains . Harvey constantly mistreats the wonderful sweet Jane . He doesn't know what he's got until he almost loses her . Three great love stories and romances in a wonderful sitcom . The wait is over .
489990	33913	61180	10.0	Are you there ?	The Whisperers is a quiet British film set in Manchester , England which is northern and quite separate from the southern part of the country . In this film , Dame Edith Evans plays Margaret or Maggie Ross , a lonely elderly woman , who has a son , Charlie , and an estranged husband , Archie . The film opens as she spends her day going to the police complaining about the interracial couple upstairs or anything . She goes to the library to read the newspaper and places her feet by the heater for warmth . She also stops at the office for assistance where one person , Conrad , played wonderfully by under-appreciated Gerald Sim looks upon her very well . Her son visits for only five minutes and leaves a secret stash of money behind which causes more problems than solves for her . Maggie is quite lonely but fiercely independent . She gets the money and believes it's hers from assistance . Not realizing it may have been her son's stolen money , Charlie goes to prison but no mention of him after the money leads to meeting a woman who takes her to the bar and takes advantage of Maggie's vulnerability . Once she is passed out , the wife's husband takes her and dumps her near her home . They have robbed her and left her to die in exposure . She survives and recovers and somehow the audience meets Archie who is bribed into taking Maggie home from the hospital and staying with her . Maggie kept all of his newspapers just as he ordered and read them in her spare room which was like a library . When she comes home to the flat , the room is cleaned up . We learn that the newspapers symbolized her husband's presence in the household . After all , she never bought the paper but read it at the library for free . So all the old papers were his is cleared up . You feel sorry for Maggie but there are so many of Maggies out there who just want a little companionship , friendship , and compassion without something in return . Dame Edith Evans surely proved her acting skills making us feel for Maggie Ross .
490826	33913	103360	10.0	13 Episodes Weren't Enough !	The Ben Stiller Show proved that good comedy exists out there . Unfortunately , Fox never gave the show a chance and it was cancelled after only airing twelve episodes . In fact , the show earned an Emmy award in the following year . The show is brilliant satire of television and modern culture of the early 1990s . I love Melrose Heights 902102104 etc . which fuses the shows of Melrose Place , Beverly Hills 90210 , and the Heights ( which was shortly canceled ) all into one . I love Janeane Garofalo who was in her element whether playing wife to a sock puppet named Skank , a prim and proper telephone operator , or spoofing Shannen Doherty . Andy Dick is also memorable as is the show's star Ben Stiller who is on the verge of stardom . I love the pilot episode where they spoof the group of U2 and Bono is singing for a cereal and at a Long Island Bar Mitzvah . The fact that they got the same manager from the Partridge Family is genius as is Paul Dooley who shows . They spoof Monkees with the Grungies in Seattle , Washington . I love the DVD and I wish there was more of Ben Stiller Show to go around .
490787	33913	160219	10.0	It was one of the first and best of E ! True Hollywood Stories !	Dominique Dunne had everything going for her . She was on the brink of acting stardom and came from a prominent Dunne family . Unfortunately , she had an abusive relationship with her boyfriend which resulted in her tragic murder . The story here is well-told in two hours on E ! . This and the Rebecca Shaeffer murder was also well-done with dignity , respect , and informative . I don't like her father , Dominic Dunne , who has been a thorn in the side of many defendants . He harbors a lot of resentment towards the legal system for failing to protect his daughter and keep her murderer behind bars . I can understand that but there is no reason to convict somebody without evidence supporting it . So Dunne's life was forever changed by his daughter's murder not for the better because his anger doesn't do anything except destroy his credibility . I know that parents of murdered children do hold this anger for the right reasons but I don't think Dunne has done anything productive except write books criticizing the legal system . I still feel for Dominique who had such a promising future as an actress and the tragic death of hers is an absolute loss to the acting community . If we can learn from her death , then her death was not entirely in vain .
489767	33913	74330	10.0	Jack Cassidy , we still miss you !	All I knew about Jack Cassidy was his sons who were in the Hardy boys . He died before I got to know him . I think this is my favorite Columbo episode with him as a magician with a secret , he was a Nazi in Germany during World War II . Cynthia Sikes plays his lovely daughter who is clueless about her father's identity and history but she is memorable and she is better known for her role in St . Elsewhere . Sadly , I hated reading about Jack Cassidy's tragic death . Wherever you are Jack , we miss you still after 30 years . Columbo always catches his man or woman even in this episode . As Columbo always says , there is no such thing as a perfect murder . Just when you think he's got away with his crimes , nothing could be further from the truth . If you love Columbo , you will love this episode and how he catches his man is just as much fun to watch and learn .
489764	33913	74329	10.0	I just loved this episode !	This is one of my favorite episodes . I love watching Diane Baker and Robert Vaughn . Wilfrid Hyde-White is also in it . Both Vaughn and Hyde-White are Columbo veterans by now , I love the unusual love story in this film an I won't spoil it for the viewers . I love Columbo and have seen almost all of them about a hundred times . The Commodore is murdered . While he was a proud businessman , he is disgusted by the greedy vultures that seem more interested in money than sailing . He had created an empire from building boats , yachts , and ships . Diane Baker plays his alcoholic daughter and I believe she is one of the best actresses around who doesn't get enough credit or work in my opinion . Robert Vaughn plays her husband . There are a lot more twist and turns in this episode than the usual Columbo episode but it's always entertaining and worth watching with great actors .
490704	33913	78714	10.0	It was the Saturday Night Live for Children	I am not going to deny This show's place in children's television history . It may have been slapstick , silly humor but it still brings back so many happy memories . I watched this show as a child religiously . Back when Nickelodeon was for children . I just wanted to be part of their cast too . I loved their opposite sketches , Christine and Lisa , little Dougie , Alanis before she became a famous singer . I had a crush on Alistair . Too bad , there is not a show like this now on television for children . When Nickelodeon first came on , this show really became part of our childhood life . I remember always talking about this show and what they got up to . I only wished they did more with the original cast . They always had a theme . This was not best written show nor did it pretend to be . It was made for it's audience and that was the children of the 1980s including myself . I will always have a soft place in my heart for this show which is rarely shown . Outdated maybe for today's kids but not for me .
490186	33913	104454	10.0	Excellent Merchant Ivory Production !	James Ivory and his longtime partner Ismail Merchant produced some of Britain's classic first-rate films . In this adaptation of E . M . Forster's novel of the same name , it has a first rate cast which introduced Emma Thompson in her Academy Award winning performance as well as Oscar winner and nominee Vanessa Redgrave in a masterclass performance as a dying woman who misses her home in Howards ' End . Sir Anthony Hopkins plays the bereaving widow who remarries Thompson in the film . The story is a complex plot but it is well-developed and displayed with first class art direction , costumes , and scenery . The film also has Nicola Duffett in a small but unforgettable role and Helena Bonham Carter as Thompson's sister . The cast is first rate as is the story in itself .
490613	33913	98352	10.0	One of Farrah's best performances	I watched Small Sacrifices again just recently after many years . Farrah Fawcett should have got an Emmy for that portrayal of Diane Downs . Her performance in this mini-series is incredible and the fact that the mini-series follows the book closely . Ann Rule's book of this horrible crime leaves you wanting more . So much that I reread the book again . Farrah should be honored for such a fabulous performance . Just watch her in the Burning Bed as a battered wife . Farrah Fawcett headlines Small Sacrifices but everybody else in the film including John Shea who plays the District Attorney and her then real-life lover , Ryan O'Neal , plays Diane Down's married lover who does not want children and would help the police convict his former lover . Ryan , John , and even Gordon Clapp are all wonderful and memorable in their roles . They do not make television mini-series like they used to anymore with cable making the movies for television . If this film was released in the cinema , Farrah would have been nominated for an Oscar for this role . She probably would have won the award !
489832	33913	120255	10.0	Oh how sweet it isn't ! The Best Film of 1997 !	The Sweet Hereafter is my choice for the best film of 1997 . I consider it a five star film . Acting , writing , and directing are all Oscar winning caliber . 1997 was a terrific year for film compared to 1998 dismal films . If there is any justice , one day this film will inherit its triumph over the shallow Titanic . I have read the book by Russell Banks . The film is about a school bus disaster which effects a small town . The film director of this film is worth watching again and again . Sir Ian Holm is definitely one of the finest actors that we never heard about who is better known for his small role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Canadian actress Sarah Polley is one to watch out for . She has a promising career ahead of her . The film will leave you speechless because this tragedy could happen . I think nothing is more tragic than the scene of the empty bus and the school bus driver who carries a burden . We never really know what caused the tragic accident that took so many lives of young children . This film is truly a disaster for mature adults . The film is close to real life with everyday and ordinary people in it . Please see it if you haven't already !
489765	33913	421470	10.0	We just love Tony's spirit !	Is it true that his show is getting canceled ? I hope not . I think it's kind of sad if you think about it . When is cancellation ever a good idea especially about a guy like Tony who appeals to an audience from all walks of life . Tony comes across as a nice guy and a pleasure to be around . I never heard anything bad about his days on the " Who's the Boss ? set " and I don't think I ever will . I remember Katherine Helmond who became his closest friend who visited him on the set for one of his first episodes . They talked about their days together and how Tony cooked for the cast and crew . How they stopped fowl language around their younger co-stars ( Danny Pintauro and Alyssa Milano ) ? Tony appears to treat everybody the same way . I think he was upset with the changes on his show which is his show . The network and bosses should leave Tony alone and do his job rather than firing others around him . Anyway , I wished Tony well and much success .
490201	33913	123338	10.0	Still on Top after Almost 40 years !	60 Minutes does something that the other shows like Primetime Live and Dateline try to capture . 60 Minutes is the top show if you're a serious journalist . If you're not , go elsewhere . On this show , ratings are always high and it was higher during the years before it led to Murder , She Wrote on Sunday nights . 60 Minutes has the best journalists around . They take their jobs seriously and treat every story as if it was the most important around . Some stories like Iraq , Afghanistan , Washington D . C . , etc . deserve the attention and most of them do the best job around with research and they get the job done . They also do lighter stories like real estate , celebrity profiles , and other light-hearted stories like Netflix and Starbucks . Of course , you can't forget Andy Rooney who always gives us what he's thinking as it is . They don't talk down to the audience but they treat us with respect and intellect . They enlighten , inform , and educate us about certain issues . Lesley Stahl , the late Ed Bradley , Morley Safer , Peter Simon , and others are top notch journalists at the top of their peak . Don't forget the occasional story by Anderson Cooper , Katie Couric , and Christiane Amanpour . Once you made 60 Minutes as a journalist , you're on top of the world .
490799	33913	92400	10.0	I watched it from the beginning to the end !	I love " Married with Children " for a lot of reasons . I remember when it first aired on the new Fox station . " Married with Children " and " The Tracey Ullman Show " were the first two shows to air on Sunday nights and the first night , it was aired twice . There has not been another show like it and it's still missed very much . When " Friends " became successful , you hoped that they would create the anti-Friends version of the show just like Married with Children Bundys was inspired by the 80's Cosby Show and the almost too real Huxtable clan . The Bundys were every family . The teens like Peg and Al who got married with no college education ended up struggling with two undesirable children like Bud and Kelly . The Bundys never had the luck like any of our other television families . Ed O'Neil deserved an Emmy . He liked Al so much that he is still fond of the role . Katey Sagal was unforgettable as Peggy with her red bouncy air and laugh . They were the unlikeliest pairing but it worked . Christina Applegate will always be remembered as the definitive dumb blonde Kelly Bundy . Her character like Peggy and Al never changed and we wouldn't want them too . Remember when they change the characters by improving them on television , the characters lose their original , natural appeal . Even David Faustino's Bud was still the pervert from beginning to end of the show . The neighbors began with Steve and Marcy Rhodes , both trained in New York City theater . Steve played by David Garrison was the typical boring father type on the show and his wife played by Amanda Bearse really became more than just a modern woman . As Marcy Rhodes Darcy , she became her own character without having too rely too much on her husband . When Garrison left the show to return to Broadway , Marcy was alone but not for long until Ted McGinley's Jefferson Darcy came into the picture . Finally Al met his match , a good-looking gigolo who avoided work . Jefferson too had a spotty history . Al and Marcy's battles were always fun to watch . In fact , Bearse also directed several of the show's episodes when she was not in front of the camera and has become one of television's comedic directors since the show ended by Fox abruptly . I loved AL's male friends like Griff , Ike , Bob Rooney , and officer Dan . The show may have made jokes at the expense of a lot of overweight even obese actresses but that gave them exposure and work so I don't think Married with Children should get too much negative criticism . I don't see other shows using plus sized women at all . This was a fun show to watch and I still miss it .
489969	33913	144306	10.0	Savannah Sizzles and Smiles with Delight ! ! !	After watching this documentary , I found myself wanting to visit Savannah , Georgia probably like many others . Characters like Lady Chablis who was born Frank but has become a woman in ever possible way but not the reproductive way was quite an amazing transformation . Then there is the wonderful Emma Kelly nicknamed the Lady of Six Thousand Songs by Johnny Mercer , a fellow Savannah legend . Of course , the documentary actually shows us the city , the tour bus that refers to references in the book by the author , John Berendt , also shown here about his love and fascination for this garden mecca . Makes you want to go and visit to see for yourself but then you feel like an outsider because you are in their world . Savannah is as close-knit and tight and hospitable to tourists , visitors , and newcomers but don't start telling them how to change their city or their ways , they'll politely nod and walk away shaking their heads .
489766	33913	77089	10.0	One of the best comedies about NYC ever !	They don't make comedies like Taxi anymore . A couple of years ago , a local television station aired a two hours worth of shows like Taxi , Welcome Back Kotter , The Jeffersons , and the Odd Couple on Saturday nights . For those of us who didn't have plans , I stayed in to watch shows that I never got to watch like on prime time because I was too young . Anyway , it ended in less than a year after it started . Sadly , those four shows were superior to our contemporary sitcoms like Will and Grace and Friends . These shows were all set in New York City and they didn't have the attractive group that today's producers need to look at when you want an audience to laugh . Sorry folks at Friends and Will and Grace , the truth is that these four shows were multi-cultural thirty years before Friends and Will and Grace . No , they weren't always attractive to the audience but who casts somebody because of their looks . It's about talent and comic genius . Taxi had a great theme music which I'm listening to right now . It also had an excellent cast of characters played by great talents like Oscar nominee Judd Hirsch , Danny DeVito , Marilu Henner , Jeff Conway , Tony Danza , Andrew Kaufman ( we miss you the most ) and Christopher Lloyd . Rhea Perlman also appeared and so many wonderful others . What separates this show from today's ideals about live in New York City is the gritty and struggling of the characters trying to make ends meet . IT still goes on today in the New York City area . You know I find this show believable now more than I ever did .
489841	33913	90493	10.0	The Queen of Talk Shows ! ! !	Let's face it , England has Queen Elizabeth II and America has Oprah Winfrey . While she might be only a talk show hostess , she already commands a billion dollar empire which includes her show , magazine , radio station , television channel , etc . She is the first African American woman to be a billionaire but also represents those of us who strive to achieve as well . Oprah's show is expected to run it's course in 2011 and please say it isn't show . Can we imagine life without her show ? Probably not , it wouldn't be same . I knew she was going to be big but as a success story when I first saw her after Color Purple and her academy award nomination . I never imagined her to be so successful beyond her wildest dreams . Oprah's show is always first rate most of the time . You may like her or dislike her but you can't avoid her show's influence and hers as well . Too bad , her film version of Beloved didn't win her an Academy Award because she deserved it . Oprah's book choices become best-sellers even though I disagree with some of her choices as too feminine and emotional . She chooses books that will make us better people . Enjoy her now while you still can because when she retires from her show , television would never be the same .
490506	33913	64400	10.0	An Excellent Condition !	So far , the film version of Tony Richardson's adaptation has been more than satisfactory . This is a must for Shakespeare fans . Nicol Williamson who should have been knighted by now which bothers me more than anything else that he has not been quite rewarded is brilliant in his role as Hamlet . He even outshines Sir Anthony Hopkins C . B . E . who plays his uncle , Claudius . I know Nicol has some personal problems which makes him a very difficult actor to work aside but he is brilliant and talented actor . Maybe he has stayed away from acting rather than go insane or mad . The scenes where his Hamlet is going mad is better than Lord Laurence Olivier . You really believe it . Some people have preferred his Hamlet to other actors who have played the role in the past . I am sure Nicol Williamson deserves to be there somewhere in the top ten list of great Hamlets . Being an artist like an actor without going crazy , mad or insane is an amazing accomplishment . For Nicol , I think he was blessed and cursed with talent and yet with difficulty . I am not excusing his difficult behavior but he is one of the most talented actors and should be rewarded with knighthood like his peers who have taken on the role of Hamlet like Sir Ian McKellen , Sir Derek Jacobi , Sir John Gielgud , Lord Laurence Olivier , Kenneth Branagh ( C . B . E . refused honor in 1996 ) , and others . I hope people will also recognize Judy Parfitt as Queen Gertrude who is quite wonderful in the role . Marianne Faithful plays Ophelia but it is really Nicol's film and worth watching again .
490273	33913	88794	10.0	I've watched this film about 7 times and I'm no dummy !	Better Off Dead is a spoof takeoff of the John Hughes ' eighties films about teen angst . John Cusack plays wonderfully as Lane Myer who had an obsessive relationship with his ex girlfriend , Beth , who breaks up the relationship for somebody better . Miserable , he tries to kill himself several times without failure . As his friend played brilliantly by Curtis Armstrong tells him " Suicide is not the answer " and lines like " I've been going to high school for 7 years , I'm no dummy . " While Lane depresses over his adolescence existence in a small northern California town , the laughs just keep getting better . His mother is obsessed with cooking . The father sets him up with a date when he worries his son is going insane . On top of all that , Lane is being hunted down by an unpaid paper boy who will stop at nothing to get his $2 . 00 and surprisingly , he finds love under his nose . I have to say this movie will leave you wanting more and more .
489971	33913	386032	10.0	The Scariest Movie in Years !	We have a health crisis in this country . About 50 million Americans are uninsured but it's not about them . It's about the insured like myself . After leaving my previous position in a public school district because they refused my request for an unpaid leave of absence as a clerk-typist ( the only way I could get a leave of absence is if somebody is ill or I'm pregnant ) . My reason for leaving a steady job was to do student teaching coordinated by my college . Kind of ironic that a school district wouldn't have approved such a request . The motive was the monthly payment to the insurance companies . Anyway , I'm paying COBRA which costs almost 600 dollars for one person . The documentary is not about the uninsured but about insured patients who aren't getting their coverage . Like the man who wanted his daughter to have both cochlear implants in both right and left ears , the insurance company only wanted to approve for one ear of this very young child . Anyway , the man decided to take action by contacting Moore with information and documents concerning his daughter . Luckily , the insurance company changed their minds . I think the most heartbreaking story was the Kansas City woman whose husband , Tracy , had kidney cancer and his only hope was to have a bone marrow transplant with his younger brother . The woman's employer and the board at the hospital declined the procedure which resulted in the man's death . Moore goes to Canada , France , and England . Too bad , he didn't go to India where many American pay cheaply for good health care . I got dual citizenship with Poland because I feared that health care in this country was deteriorating in 2000 . In France , the French citizens or denizens are given free health care , university schooling ( only if you pass tests ) , 5 weeks vacation , 35 hours per week workload , pensions , government assistance , family care , government nannies , etc . It makes you want to pack up and move to Paris . Although Moore does leave out that France does have problems of their own . I didn't like any Americans at the café who boasting about their lives in Paris , France maybe it's because I envy them . I know Michael Moore says that America is the best country around but not in health care for it's citizens . In fact , most Americans are overworked , exhausted , tired , stressed , and strained from being American because they worry about health care , pensions , and the fewer options . Look at the couple who became bankrupt because of having health insurance or the woman who would marry a Canadian for health care . The insurance company didn't believe that she had cervical cancer at only 22 years old so they declined her care . She headed north to Canada for health care . The politicians and the health care industry are milking the profits for themselves . Look at Los Angeles where hospital dumping of homeless and mentally ill patients are routine at the mission without warning or care . I bet most drug addicts suffer from depression and illegal drugs are cheaper than the legal drugs . When the 09-11 volunteer , Reggie , learned that the same breathing inhaler in Havana , Cuba costs about nickel when in America , it costs about $120 . 00 . Moore's genius is getting people's attention to see , learn , and experience what most Americans are going through . It's not a non-partisan issue that Americans aren't getting health care and suffering for it . Just realize that 18 , 000 patients die yearly because they can't afford or receive their proper treatment . Think about the 79 year old supermarket worker who is working for his prescription plan .
490501	33913	436697	10.0	Dame Helen's Oscar Finally !	Dame Helen Mirren is one of the world's foremost talented actresses that she has won countless awards . Her casting of Queen Elizabeth II is quite stunning considering that she already played her namesake and won an Emmy for it . She really becomes the Queen that we all know and love because she blends into the role so well that it's nearly impossible to think of her as the same person who played Jane Tennison , a Titanic Survivor in the S . O . S . Titanic . I admired Sylvia Syms and think she should become a Dame herself . James Cromwell is great as Prince Phillip and should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well . I can't forget Sylvia and think she deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as well . Stephen Frears really deserves nominations for recreating a week that was well unforgettable because it was so painful . I always knew that the Royals were real decent people with flaws and problems of their own . It's hard to imagine them as anything other than the caricatures that the British tabloid press make them out to be . The Royals have lived in a fishbowl their entire lives and will do so . It's not easy being Royal , I'm sure the Queen has her days as well .
490753	33913	77353	10.0	One of the best Columbo !	George C . Scott's wife Trish Van Devere gives an excellent and memorable performance as a woman scorned by her secret boyfriend and network executive . I can't blame her character for being so upset . Her longtime secret male companion treats her like leftover meat . He plans to go to New YOrk City and take a top network job while she is treated with no indifference since she is the backbone and force behind the network . She makes few bad decisions but she knows too much and she feels used time and time again . I love her discussions with Columbo . They get along pretty well . Lainie Kazan has a supporting role playing a celebrity with a lot of personal and emotional problems . Too bad , there a not a lot of top television female executives around . The killing of her boss and lover shows that you don't mess with a strong , smart woman and expect to buy her love off with a car .
