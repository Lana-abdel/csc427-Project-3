490337	33913	157246	2.0	Just a Disgrace !	I tried to like Will and Grace . Believe me I tried . But i always get the wrong impression watching this show . Even when they advertise for Will and Grace , he has his arms around her . Isn't he supposed to be gay ? I don't get the relationship between a straight woman and this metro homosexual played by Eric McCormack . There always seems to be unspoken attraction and desire for Will and Grace to get together . Now Will is gay so forget about it . But I think it provides the wrong impression that straight heterosexual women need the company of gay men for platonic friendship . Heterosexual women are very competitive and vicious about going after men and they probably feel comfortable with gay men as friends but it's still sending the wrong message of heartbreak and the lack of realism . I also find Megan Mullally's character as Karen annoying and Sean Hayes ' Jack equally annoying . These four characters are the most shallow , vain , characters on television . Why would anybody straight or gay want them ? Over the last 8 years , this show has been considered a breakthrough but I think it sets women back . I liked Debra Messing better on Ned and Stacey . DOn't get me wrong about gays and straights having friendship . I think it's possible and happens all the time but Will and Grace's relationship should have ended when Will got out of the closet in the first place . YOu shouldn't run back to your best female former girlfriend for love and support if you're a gay man . Thank God , these characters ' haven't reproduced . They're too vain and shallow for that in the first place . So don't get me wrong about gay rights ? I support gay equal rights and discrimination and even gay marriages or civil unions but I don't support this show because I'm a feminist and I don't think this will help women like Grace .
490338	33913	461721	2.0	Sorry , this isn't it , Seth ?	I love Seth Green . His appearances on THat 70s ' Show is always worth watching but last night , I felt the show needed to overhauled . Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for . The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place . So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out . Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable . I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up . There did not seem to be much humor in it . I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night . I think they should go back , scrap this series , and start over . We need more family involved series . How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down . THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook , play the mother and dysfunctional siblings . The list of possibilities with somebody like Seth Green are endless and the network is blowing it .
490570	33913	430836	3.0	Why not expand Entertainment Tonight to an Hour Instead ?	The Insider and Entertainment Tonight are just two annoying television shows regarding the entertainment industry . I get more information from the TMZ show . Most of the time , they are just promoting stories and teasing the audience about it . When they get to the promoted story , they spend less time than you can imagine . I remember Lara Spencer who was a reporter for ABC in the New York City affiliate before coming to The Insider . She is promising reporter but she spends so much time on fluff stuff . Entertainment news shows are past it's prime with competition E ! , internet , and other shows . Entertainment Tonight was the first and probably the best until now . The Insider is just the expanded hour and promo into Entertainment Tonight anyway . Besides , they used to focus on all kinds of celebrities back in the day when you couldn't miss it . Today , the celebrities that are covered on these shows aren't worthy of the attention . I remember when they remembered celebrities who passed away . At the end of the show , they would roll clips and play music . I was hoping that with Estelle Getty that they would do the same thing by remembering her with clips from her career and interviews while playing the Golden Girls theme song . That was a missed opportunity . Instead , they talked about what's coming up next . They used to do that before the credits rolled .
490385	33913	217630	4.0	Couldn't be a better title !	I'm not much for movies nowadays about teens but this garbage was on in my hotel room . Loser is unrealistic but thoughtful love story between a commuter female college student sleeping with her professor and the boy who falls in love with her . It has its moments and charming scenes but overall it's lame just like most of the movies out there . Anyway the film could have been better because it seems to just move in a predictable direction rather than maintain some memorable moments in the film . The acting was mediocre along with the writing and I don't think they shot it in New York City but I can't be sure . Anyway , it's just another teen movie that grossly underestimates the college experience .
490293	33913	190524	4.0	Interesting film about the end of the world	Left Behind is a hard film to swallow unless you are a believer . While I believe in the possibility of Armageddon , I find it hard to believe that children and people would disappear without their clothes everywhere off the world . They don't explain the cause of their disappearance or where they go too . I am glad for Kirk Cameron to have an opportunity . I always liked him since Growing Pains . He does his best work yet in this film with his wife , Chelsea Noble . But I loved Colin Fox and he was totally miscasted for the role as the Jewish doctor , Dr . Chaim Rosenzweig , with the formula to feed the world . While this story is hard to believe , its still watchable but don't panic about the end of the world yet . These books are partly fiction .
490491	33913	56758	5.0	Butcher Jill Farren Phelps does it again !	After Santa Barbara , Guiding Light , Another World , and One Life to Live , the Soap Butcher Jill Farren Phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows . When I was watching Guiding Light , it was at its peak in 1991 . They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps . She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death . She killed off beloved Ellen Parker's character Maureen . So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience . On Another World , she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell's beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline . On One Life to Live , I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover . Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role . I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow . The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely . She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death . Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones . Why aren't the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick ? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps . I know Monty's heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn't successful as the Luke & Laura days but still , I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps . Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people . I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps ' known favoritism for certain actors . I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair . But I know after 25 years of watching soaps , I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew . I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me . I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans . Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation ! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat . Remember Another World ! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live . What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen . Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children . Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years . I'm concerned that she is going to lose one of the show's best attributes , the Quartermaine Family . She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute . Even with John Ingle's welcome return , the shadow over the show is still different . I don't blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon's departure . It's as shocking as it comes . This is what you get when you have somebody like Phelps at the helm .
490638	33913	112002	5.0	Never Made It Up High Enough !	I was thrilled that Jean Smart and Mary McDonnell were going to do a sitcom probably inspired by the British comedy , Absolutely Fabulous , about two upper class spoiled New Yorkers . Faith Prince was terribly underused and under-rated . She was supposed to be huge after her triumphant performance in Guys and Dolls opposite Nathan Lane but Smart and McDonnell did what they could with a terrible script . I was hoping that the show would last longer than it did which was only a few episodes . Both actresses are accomplished veterans of the sitcom genre that they should have used their experiences to make this show better . Maybe the idea of two rich and spoiled divorced women are reminiscent of The First Wives Club . I didn't care for that much neither .
490173	33913	75145	6.0	First Rate Cast can't help weak script !	I love James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson as a couple . They live in the ghetto or slums of Los Angeles , California in the 1970s . The rest of the cast includes the under-used Hilda Haynes and Louis Gosset Jr . The story of Johnny Williams as a poet and his ill wife played by Tyson is not so bad and their surroundings are undesirable as they battle crime , gangs , violence , and living in a tough part of the city . Jones and Tyson are a formidable pair and strong together on screen and they are worth watching the film alone even if it's not that great on paper . JOnes's performance elevates the role into a complex character of JOhnny Williams and there are familiar actors and actresses also in this film . The River Niger might not be that great but it's not that bad and Tyson and Jones are so strong together that you can see them at odds as well . Johnny loves his wife , Mattie , and strives as a poet but the scene where he reads to Mattie is heartbreaking , emotional , and worth watching . I didn't care for the other scenes involving the gangs , violence , and crime . I just loved watching Tyson and JOnes as a couple .
490611	33913	340256	7.0	Prematurely Canceled !	My Big Fat Greek Life could have worked if they allowed it too evolve on its own in time . Sadly canceled by CBS due to poor ratings ! It was aired on Sunday nights and not the Monday nights during the comedy lineup . When will networks learn to give comedies a chance like in the past , I could name several shows like All in the Family , Married with Children , Cheers , just to name a few that did not have great ratings in the beginning but they become decent funny shows . Unlike dramas , comedies are a lot harder to gain a solid audience . I remember the good old days of CBS ' Monday nights with shows like Kate & Allie , and Newhart . Maybe , syndication is where comedies can thrive without the network pressure . I remember watching sitcoms like Mama's Family and Charles in Charge in syndication after their network years .
490363	33913	799668	7.0	Bubba is studying hard !	Bubba is now a college student and studying regularly with Toni Malone who is not a boy but a fellow female college student from Raytown Junior Community College . Mama has been trying to find out who is been sleeping in Bubba's bed when she finds a black bra while making the bed with Iola . The truth might be shocking than the assumption . Mama tries to get the truth out of Bubba . All the time , Naomi and Vint are trying to get pregnant as well and using a book to guide them along and somehow I believe it reads that you shouldn't have sex to have a baby which is news for Thelma . While Vint and Naomi are trying to get pregnant , Iola and Thelma are trying to play detectives in determining who is sleeping in Bubba's bed or not ?
489742	33913	120824	7.0	It's alright but it's not complete !	Kevin Spacey gives a command performance as Quoyle , the man who fears the water . The movie is rather surprising with Cate Blanchett as almost unrecognizable as Petal , his former wife . Quoyle is rather a tragic and sad figure of a man . He loves his daughter and his former wife but he has his own demons to battle like a father who had killed his wife and himself . His father phones and leaves a message about not having to depend on welfare . We get to learn more about his father from Aunt Agnes Hamm played by Dame Judi Dench . Aunt Agnes is rather very new to Quoyle . He probably was not aware of her existence . Dame Judi really knows how to speak with a Newfoundland accent without much help . What we don't know about Aunt Agnes ' past , we soon learn the horrible truth and why she detests her brother and seeks revenge on his remains . The casting includes Julianne Moore , who perfected the Newfoundland accent , as a native resident and widow with a small child . Julianne and Kevin have chemistry . In fact , Kevin also becomes part of the community by working on the paper . Pete Postlethwaite ( Spielberg considers him to be one of his favorite actors / OBE recipient ) plays Spacey's boss or fellow employee . Lass Hallstrom did a wonderful job but there are things I have trouble with this film . I feel that I don't understand what actually happened and the resolution . The movie leaves you asking more questions than answers and you want to see more and even dream about someplace like Newfoundland .
489793	33913	780442	7.0	Give This Show a Chance Please !	I saw last night's episode . While I have to admit , I was hoping for more . I just love John Lithgow and Jeffrey Tambor . I can't believe they never worked before . I am hoping that NBC will allow this show to evolve because I think it has a lot of promise especially with first rate cast . I believe that Tambor and Lithgow's relationship on screen mirrors off-screen . I wish the writing was better but I hope that the show will improve if given a full season . I prefer John in 3rd Rock from the Sun but I'll take him whenever he comes on television . Jeffrey Tambor is also a brilliant actor . They could have made it the Golden Boys of this decade . With Lithgow and Tambor , you can't go wrong . I hope they plan on getting stars like Dame Eileen Atkins , Jessica Walter , Jason Bateman , Jane Curtin , and anybody else they worked with in the past . Lithgow and Tambor could be the new comedy team of this century so please let this show developed into something that can last for years .
489735	33913	200550	7.0	From a True South Amboy Girl !	I was born in Amboy , Perth Amboy , right across the river from South Amboy where the girl , Violet Sanford , was supposed to be from . I was there the day that the film came to town to shoot the opening scene . They all ordered pizza from the pizzeria , Delios , right across the street whose owners are truly Sicilian born and bred who have been making pizza since before I was born . I met some of the crew members . The filming only lasted a couple of days but I remember it like yesterday . South Amboy is not so far away from New York City that Violet could have made the trek on her own like the hundreds who do from the South Amboy train station which goes directly to Penn Station . I really became a fan of Piper while watching the film last night on television as well as Maria Bello who plays bar owner , Lil . My family are huge admirers of Melanie Lynskey mostly from her role as Rose on Two and Half Men but she's good here except she plays the accent just a little too thick . Nobody in South Amboy talks like that . You can't help but love John Goodman . Anyway the film's alright with a story of Violet Sanford who wishes to become a songwriter .
490726	33913	116240	7.0	If you are really into Terms of Endearment !	I was kind of disappointed . I was expected the same from the sequel with the role of Aurora Greenway played by Academy Award Winner Shirley Maclaine again . Of course , Jack Nicholson won his second Oscar for his role as her lover . In this film , Aurora deals with troubled grandchildren who she helped raise because the father was absentee . One grandson is in prison and her granddaughter is as stubborn as her daughter Emma played by Debra Winger was . Also Miranda Richardson plays a Texan friend that wanted to raise Emma . Also Marion Ross is cast in the role as Rosie Dunlop , Aurora's maid or housekeeper . There were some changes like ROsie lived at the house but Marion Ross earned a Golden Globe nomination and probably would have earned her Academy Award nomination if the film got better reviews . Marion does an excellent job in making us care so much for Rosie .
490247	33913	69903	7.0	Double Exposed !	Columbo has to match wits with Robert Culp again in this episode . I don't know offhand how many episodes that featured Robert Culp but I remember this one . He is a scientist who specializes in mental manipulation . I couldn't think of another way to explain it . Anyway , Columbo has met his match in this episode . Robert Culp's character kills somebody who wants to destroy his professional reputation as a top scientist who helps improves sales in grocery stores and other ways . Anyway , you have to watch how Columbo catches him . Like a typical episode , he becomes interested in his line of work but does not forget the victim or the crime . It's worth noting that it's pretty sophisticated in 1973 and I would watch it again if I have too but it's not my favorite episode of his or with Robert Culp .
490250	33913	69900	7.0	An interesting twist in crime !	A Stitch in Crime is a typical Columbo episode with it's usual twists . We know who did it from the every beginning . Leonard Nimoy is superb as the unlikable surgeon who is very vain and conceited in my opinion but I love Leonard Nimoy as an actor anyway . The story is better written than most . They don't spend that much time in the hospital which is nice . Of course , Columbo buts heads with Nimoy's surgeon character quite often enough to irritate him but you can't help but love Columbo . When he catches his man or woman in some cases , it's always the least likely way . He has a good supporting cast but forgettable since I can't remember any of their names .
490633	33913	294150	7.0	Too bad , Mr . Wizard is gone !	The real Mr . Wizard is gone now but during his years on Canadian Broadcasting Company , he was really the science guy of my generation . Episodes of the show were aired frequently and on Nickelodeon in it's hey day or when I was growing up . Nickelodon looked to the North for children's programming . Since they stopped showing Canadian shows , the network has never been the same . Mr . Wizard played by Don Herbert made science fun without being intimidating or without being a snob . Mr . Wizard was one of those shows that allowed science to be fun but it was not as entertaining as Bill Nye . It didn't have to be because we still watched the show anyway . I believed the show was film in Calgary or somewhere in Canada . I still desire to visit there since the 1988 Winter Olympics . Today's Mr . Wizard is Bill Nye but still I do miss Don Herbert's Mr . Wizard and the kids who made science fun for thirty minutes .
490324	33913	85049	7.0	It had Agnes Nixon all over it !	When Loving first premiered , it was big on television . After all , this was the child of two great and creative geniuses , Agnes Nixon and Douglas Marland . It had great potential and lasted for as long as it could . It never recovered from Ryan's Hope as a lead in show . I remember the cast . The actors and actresses were pretty and the set always looked like you could put it on All My Children . But sadly , the show never maintained or garnered a large audience like All My Children . There is no question that there were great actors on the show like Wesley Addy , Celeste Holm , Christine Tudor , Larkin Malloy , Lisa Peluso , Nada Rowand , and more that I have forgotten . I haven't seen the show in years but it never got much recognition like it's sister shows , All My CHildren and One Life to Live . Maybe if Douglas Marland had stayed on as head writer , the show would have become more like AS the World TUrns . But the truth is that it was worth watching when soaps ruled daytime . Now , there is only 1 30 minute show on the air .
490668	33913	315327	7.0	A Crack at Taking God's Job !	Bruce Nolan was an aspiring journalist who wanted nothing more than the local anchorman job in Buffalo , New York instead of doing funny bits of news like the introduction where he is at Polish bakery celebrating the city's largest chocolate chip cookie . It starts off smart but it wears thin overall . Bruce is played by the unforgettable Jim Carrey who is brilliant at physical comedy much like John Ritter , Don Knotts , and Jerry Lewis in this film . Morgan Freeman plays God who transfers his powers to him to see what it would be like to be God . So Bruce is now God and he must hear prayers and confessions of everybody . God's job is not easy if you are believer . He has a lot of work but I take this comedy as is rather than serious drama . Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend ( how did Brad Pitt trade her for Angelina is beyond me ? ) . She is equally superb in the straight woman role . There are supporting players like Steve Carrell , Nora Dunn , and Sally Kirkland to name only a few .
490086	33913	317198	7.0	Not as Good as the First !	First , I thought the lesbian twist towards the end was a bit much and I didn't see it coming because it wasn't so important . Anyway , why is Bridget Jones who is every woman in my opinion torn between two men played by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth . Both men are well-known and respected talented British actors with stage , television , and film experience . Why are they drawn to Bridget as is the lesbian surprise in the end which goes off so badly in my opinion ? Bridget is chunky , unpredictable , and often annoying in this film . She is still the every woman in my opinion because not all women can look and act great . Bridget again is alone looking for love but the choice is always obvious . I loved the Thailand scenes since I was there in October . It's a great location but the storyline and plotting was sort of inferior to the original film . I love Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones return as Bridget's parents . I'm waiting for Colin , Hugh and Gemma to make the British honors list . Jim has already declined the honor .
489874	33913	257315	7.0	A Delightful uneven show !	I like My Family . NJN started showing it in the place of " Last of the Summer Wine " or what I like to call " British version of Desperate Housewives . " I much prefer them to anything on television . In fact , I love British comedies and I only saw My Family briefly on a British Airways flight 2 years ago so now I have it at least once a week . I love Zoe Wanamaker C . B . E . and Tony winning Robert Lindsay although the children actors have to compete with such talent . It's nice to see a British family for a change . On British shows , children are often never shown . I loved the premiere pilot with the bunny rabbit and would gladly give it a home . I thought it was cute that Zoe and Lindsary were talking to him like a member of the family . I look forward to more episodes of this show . BBC should do more to create comedies . I always prefer the Brits to the American comedies any day .
490812	33913	96590	7.0	La Vie De France !	I really enjoyed this comedy series better in France than in England . Maybe they can bring their show to America ! If only BBC made more episodes per season like the United States , I would gladly campaign for that idea . The British make better comedies than we Americans do . First , I didn't see their previous series , Fresh Fields , with cast members Ann Beach as neighbor Sonia , Hester's mom played by Fanny Rowe , and Hester's dad played by Ballard Berkeley . Anyway , this show is better in the French version as the Fields get used to life in France . The Fields are played by veterans Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers ( another two possible British honorees ) . Julia's Hester is quite lovable but I wish she would sing because she has a phenomenal singing voice that she is also known for her work in West End musicals . Anton is better known for his other series , May to December .
490268	33913	74860	7.0	It was a decent film but it could have been better	At the end of the Marathon Man , I felt myself asking a lot more questions about Dustin's character . I thought Lord Laurence Olivier did wonderful chilling performance as the evil Nazi dentist was worthy to watch but I felt the story was not solid enough to explain the situation . But still , it is worth watching . I loved the scenes shot on location in Manhattan . I felt confused after watching this movie . I understand what happens but I don't why which left me wanting more of this film to answer my questions . I thought Olivier was just marvelous and so was Dustin Hoffman who were very hard for this role according to the story of making this film . Olivier told him to imagine not sleeping nights rather than actually working sleeplessly .
490142	33913	29608	7.0	A Tear Jerker !	Barbara Stanwyck was one of America's finest actresses whether on film or television . I don't know much about her stage career but she was always brilliant and unforgettable . In this film , which is one of her most beloved roles is Stella Martin Dallas , a poor woman who marries a rich man and has a daughter , Laurel . Unfortunately , the marriage ends and she leaves the daughter with the father . It's one of those tear-jerking films that you need a box of Kleenex around to wipe the tears . There is no doubt that this role and many others of her long wonderful career allowed her to be one of the finest American actresses around . They remade this film with Bette Midler in the Stella Dallas role but it can't be matched by Stanwyck's beautiful interpretation of a woman that could have be done inadequately by any other actress .
490794	33913	88610	7.0	Not so Bad !	Remember that this show was one of the first sitcoms in syndication in the 1980s . It was a new thing . When a sitcom or drama could not get a network , they went with syndication . I thought this show was alright in syndication because it reached a wide audience . I often saw it on Saturday evenings usually before Mama's Family . I was a kid so I didn't know better . I think we pretended that we were Viki or played her in our backgrounds . The show was never meant to be serious in the first place . The cast was somewhat decent with Marla Pennington , Edie McClurg who left to do Hogan Family , Tiffany Bressette , the guy who played her father , the brother , and the red-head girl next door with her father . The writing wasn't great but it wasn't bad . I don't recall ever not watching it . It just seemed like it came for a simpler time . I only wish Syndication was still around . It is but not as it was in the 1980s . It was the equivalent for independent films , rather just sitcoms .
490095	33913	100004	7.0	The Queen of Mean Reigns Supreme !	Suzanne Pleshette deserved an award for playing the most unlikable woman or most hated woman in recent history , Leona Rosenthal Helmsley . She climbed her way to the top of the New York Real Estate market which is quite brutal if you read anything about it . She found ultimate love and happiness with Harry Helmsley , a married billionaire . The two were destined for each other . He divorced his wife of many years and married Leona Helmsley . Pleshette plays Leona quite well almost perfect . Only because the book by the same name was used as a resource . The movie does not mention that Leona and Harry were active philanthropists who donated their vast fortune to charities . Now that Leona , Harry , and even Suzanne Pleshette who was grandiose , charming , and mad at times in this role are gone to a better place .
489829	33913	103496	7.0	One of the Oddest British comedies ever !	I have to say that this show introduced me to the great actress , Geraldine McEwan , who now plays Miss Marple in the new series but the actor Karl Howman who plays Mulberry is quite an odd chap as they would say . He's not who he appears to be and his reasons for being employed by Mrs . Farnaby , a lonely spinster of a woman who lives on a manor , is rather strange . I don't want to scare anybody off but the plot behind the dark man is enough to get you asking way too many questions . The longtime dedicated servants , Bert and Alice , are extras . The Alices were changed between seasons for reasons unknown because British comedies don't work like American comedies in the first place . They make fewer episodes and sometimes actors or actresses are committed to the theater , television , or other film project . Anyway , the writing is satisfactory but I never understood the whole point of Mulberry , the man who helps this lonely lady of the estate reclaim some life in her . Geraldine McEwan who would have been Dame by now does a superb job in making you feel sympathy for her . Sylvia Sims has a guest appearance as Mulberry's mother .
490558	33913	97087	7.0	A good episode and entertaining !	What makes Columbo work in my opinion is that despite the seriousness of the crime which is always murder that there is light-heartedness . Fisher Stevens is the star of his own movie . The cast is excellent besides Stevens and Peter Falk as the dashing Columbo . You have Molly Hagen who is underused in the industry and has appeared in another Columbo as Fisher's girlfriend . They also have Nan Martin who is wonderful as the woman who helps and hurts the lead character . Anyway , the filmmaker played by Fisher Stevens does learns the hard way by trying to fool Columbo . You can't fool or mess with him around or you'll get caught . He always catches his man or woman . This episode could have been better but it's not bad .
490366	33913	102933	8.0	Sizzling True Story !	Few stories are worth adapting to the screen . Elizabeth Montgomery gives a mind-bending brilliant performance as Ruth Coe , the beloved and twisted mother , of serial rapist Kevin Coe . It's not enough that her own son has been found , arrested , convicted , and imprisoned as the South Hill Rapist in Spokane , Washington . The South Hill Rapist struck usually in the mornings during his mornings when he jogged . He also struck about forty known victims and there were probably more than fifty knowing some who didn't report the crimes to the authorities . All the while , Mommy Dearest Ruth Coe refuses to believe any evidence and defends her son to the hilt . Elizabeth Montgomery's performance is chilling as is Dale Midkiff who plays her son . Now the real Kevin Coe might be released unless the state of Washington can place him on a island where he can be imprisoned for life as a dangerous sex offender . Even to this day , Spokane has not recovered from the years of terror as the South Hill Rapist struck and attacked his female victims .
490388	33913	63141	8.0	One of Vanessa Redgrave's best performances !	Vanessa Redgrave who should be awarded Dame Commander of the British Empire if it was up to me but she declined damehood in 1999 and even regrets accepting the C . B . E . in 1967 . She gives one of her best and memorable performances as the legendary dancer , Isadora Duncan . It is a long and memorable movie . THe best lover in my opinion is the foreign piano lover who is described first by Isadora as " hideous and revolting . " When they finally share a carriage ride , she begins to recognize his inner beauty of another artist . Isadora's life is also tragic with the loss of her two children in a dreadful car accident . This film is really Vanessa Redgrave's vehicle . She drives smoothly from beginning to end . American actress , Cynthia Harris , does a good job in a featured role in this film . So does Jason Robards and others who bring the life to this wonderful creature .
490722	33913	98878	8.0	Better without Rob Morrow !	Rob Morrow as the typical uptight Jewish New York City doctor gets relocated to Cicely , Alaska . The show was filmed around Seattle , Washington . While I love the beauty of Alaska , Morrow's role was nauseating , neurotic , and stereotypical . He hates his assignment . It's too far from everywhere , Seattle is the nearest city . What about Vancouver ? That's where they shoot Men in Trees now . Fortunately , the show's stellar supporting cast like Peg Phillips as the general store owner , Ruth Anne Miller was unforgettable , Cynthia Geary , John Corbett became a longtime Seattle resident , John Corbin , Janine Turner , and other cast members loved the locale of their show so much that they based themselves there . Who wouldn't love Seattle and the Snohomish Mountains or Alaska ? Now they can be seen on DVD , season by season . But for several seasons , Monday night was the place to be to curl and watch Northern Exposure .
490052	33913	98876	8.0	Penelope Keith CBE OBE is the Queen of British Comedy !	I don't know why the High Sheriff of Surrey Penelope Keith CBE OBE is not considered the reigning queen of British comedy . She has more British comedies to her credit than anybody else that I know . In this show , she plays a minister of parliament better known as MP Jean Price . She gets elected and must battle the other politicians and the men's world that was normally parliament . The show had a brief run on my local PBS station and I haven't seen it since then . It was a good classic comedy with smart writing and brilliant acting with serious topics that concerned the ordinary Britons that she represents . I would want Jean Price as my representative for Parliament or my congressional representative in the United States Congress . She is smart and clever and knows it . She is married and her children are grown . The show should be available on DVD to enjoy for us all over again .
490034	33913	98844	8.0	It's time to pull the plug !	At first , I was thrilled to have watched Law & Order with it's sharp , sophisticated writing and it's New York City backdrop . But it's been 18 years since it's preview , I think now is the time to end the show . I can see stories repeating themselves with a different cast and a different circumstance . Law & Order like other shows have the run it's course at least 8 years ago . I am grateful that they hire some of New York City's actors and actresses along with it's cast and crew . But sadly , the show's legacy is that it's been on too long . The first years were great because it was new and fresh and now we are saying goodbye to beloved cast mates . I remember fondly seeing Jerry Orbach and Benjamin Bratt on the East 35th Street in New York City in October 1997 . They were warm , friendly and gracious to us onlookers . They posed for the camera and smiled at us while they were doing their job . It's one of my favorite memories of working in New York City was seeing them even though I was fired from my job that week . Law & Order is focused on the investigation and the trial but the show does it only in 40 minutes . It's not enough time for an actual investigation .
490113	33913	640573	8.0	Mama gets swindled !	When Mama wants a car , she goes after it with her mad money of about $1 , 000 saved up . She decides to go to a used car dealer played brilliantly by Fred Williard as Willy , the dealer was also a childhood friend of Vint's . He shows Mama , Vint , and Naomi around his used car lot referring his cars as his wayward children . Mama is definite that she wants a natural blue car since a relative had a blue car for years . When she gets the car , she decides to take Aunt Fran , Naomi , Vint , Buzz and Sonja for a ride but it never gets there . She bought a lemon and now wants her money back from Willy the Weasel . After she baked homemade oatmeal raisin cookies which Willy gobbled up so fast , Mama goes back for her money and she's not taking no for an answer .
490361	33913	640572	8.0	Here's Your Dime , Spill It ?	Mama Thelma Harper has been accused of being forgetful while Naomi rescues a dog known as Old Lady from the parking lot at Food Circus . Since Mama doesn't care for dogs , Naomi , Vint , Iola , and Bubba pretend that the dog barking doesn't exist . So Mama thinks she's hearing things or going crazy by the sound the dog barking . Unaware of Old Lady's existence , the family now has an answering machine which Iola gave to them . It's funny how they each take turns leaving the message for the recording . The messages about how the Old Lady should be put to sleep or go to a home where she can run around and be sedated have Mama Harper on edge . They think the messages are for her and when food is disappearing from the kitchen table . Mama thinks she's going insane .
490254	33913	68401	8.0	Revolutionary if you think about !	Well , Columbo's case this time involves the wife , Cathy Goodland , who prefers other relationships to her lovesick husband . He takes up with a beautiful and attractive woman but only to talk about it . He and his rich uncle played by Ray Milland set up a kidnapping in order to get her attention . Even though there is money involved , Columbo knows something's wrong with his chief suspect who is an avid gardener . Ray Milland gives an excellent performance as the uncle . The rest of the cast appear satisfactory in my opinion . The story could have used more work but it is typical Columbo if you watch it enough times like I have over the years . An open marriage was hardly mentioned in the 1980s much less in the 1970s but it was there . The widow Goodland makes no excuses for her lifestyle . She doesn't have to explain to anybody else about her spending free time with attractive sailors who could be easily bought for the right price but it's all wrapped up in trust funds .
489948	33913	424609	8.0	Give Hank a Title Credit Like all The Other Cast Members !	I have to say I admire and love Ron Eldard's performance as Jim Dunbar , the homicide detective who goes blind in a deadly shooting match . He plays him beautifully with such depth and care . Ron Eldard is really an outstanding actor . He brings such charisma , heart , and love to this role . I was impressed with Marisol Nichols as his assigned partner . Women always get the shaft in the working world and are held back particularly in the police field . I was not impressed with Rena Sofer . I think they could have casted somebody better for that role . She does her best with the little lines she had last night . I was impressed and thrilled to see Guiding Light Alumni Frank Grillo played a fellow police detective Marty Russo . He really captures the character . Jim's guide dog Hank deserves to be recognized as an official cast member in the show's credits . Hank is loyal and faithful to Jim no matter what in their relationship . Jim's relationship with Hank is closer than Jim is with his wife who feels out of place in their relationship . I hope this show lasts longer than 13 episodes . I am personally upset that the show is taken place in New York City . Too many crime shows film and take place in New York . It would be nice for a cop show to be filmed elsewhere like Chicago , San Francisco , or Los Angeles . I am grateful for the show's usage of New York City for financial reasons and the opportunities for it's cast and crew . There are just too many shows about cops set in New York City . I can't watch Law & Order anymore and I never watched CSI . I prefer forensic shows like American Justice , City Confidential , and Cold Case Files all on A & E . Blind Justice should be about the relationship of a blind police detective and the people in his life .
490121	33913	89853	8.0	Partially Shot in my Hometown !	I remember when this film was being filmed in my hometown which seemed so long ago . Woody Allen and his crew came to my town for a couple of days and shot the diner scenes in South Amboy at this old fashioned diner . Unfortunately , the business was moved to New York but anyway I remember the newspaper that covered it . I never saw the film until years later . I recognized the diner and I remember eating there once . but besides that , the film is quite entertaining about life and wanting to live inside the movies . Jeff Daniels does a superb job in making us believe that a movie character can leave the screen . Of course , we know it's not possible . Mia Farrow does a superb job in the role as Cecilia , the unhappy waitress and wife . The story was well-written but not Woody's genius .
490664	33913	320970	8.0	Why it's still standing ?	Simple , it can be a very entertaining show . Mark Addy who is British plays Chicago Bill Miller . Mark is better known for his performances in The Fully Monty and the British comedy classic , The Thin Blue Line . Mark does a first rate job at making Bill Miller into a blue collar American every man . His co-star Jami Gertz better remembered for her roles in the 1980s films , The Lost Boys , and Sixteen Candles does an equally fantastic job at playing Judy Miller . They were the couple from high school who married and had children . I love watching Sally Struthers play Bill's mom . She's fabulous and under-rated as a performer . She can do more than just play whining Gloria from All in the Family . Anyway the plots don't do the talent justice for the family . It was a surprise hit because I think we just miss family comedies . I think the actors who play the children also do a fantastic job at making us believe in them . Overall , it's a good show but not great . It's writing could be stronger to make this cast shine .
489997	33913	1183579	8.0	It's not great but it's getting better !	Okay , I was a fan of the Australian show but there a lot of obvious differences between the American version . First , I have to say that the pilot opened with Kim leaving her husband Craig of six weeks of marriage because over her selfishness-vanity behavior . You see it in this episode more clearly . Kim is a self-obsessed narcissist I think who is too concern about herself than about others . In this episode , the show belongs to Molly Shannon who can break your heart as a home-based hairdresser . I don't remember if Australian Kath was one but it doesn't matter . In this episode , Molly Shannon's performance can make just feel for her after her client tells her that her daughter is going to a real salon for her prom night . You could just tell that Kath was really hurt and tries to pretend it doesn't hurt . In this episode , she tries to get herself known at the mall promenade show featuring mall-based businesses . Her fiancé Phil gets her in but they get the worst spot in the mall . It's her daughter that can save the day if she's not distracting her estranged husband from his job in electronics at the mall . The self-described trophy wife gets banned from the mall just as her mother needs her the most for the show . The final scenes are little out there .
490026	33913	70016	8.0	A Childhood Classic Brought To Life !	As a child , I fondly remembered Charlotte's Web , the animated version . I have no desire to see the live version . Debbie Reynolds will always be Charlotte , the creative brilliant spider , who befriends Wilbur . I remember Fern saving Wilbur from his own death and raising him as a baby . Once the runt grows a little , Fern is devastated to send him to a farm where he can with other animals . Although Fern does visit him , it's not the same as she cared for him like her baby . The animation is not brilliant because this film was done long before computers but it still holds up to the story and it always worth watching with young ones and even old ones . The animation is not first rate but it's not bad neither . It's not on par with animation today and don't expect it too . But it's not about how computers can brilliantly animate where we don't need live actors or actresses , the story here is faithful to the E . B . White's novel classic and it is respected here . You can't help but tear up at the end .
490716	33913	98801	8.0	James Earl Jones is terrific in this role !	I remember when this show came on the air and how it ended . It was a terrible shame because James Earl Jones is one of our country's finest actors . Finally , he gets a series of his own but the show never really gained a large following after a season and was canceled by the network . It did have a terrific cast and won Emmys for James Earl Jones and others but the show never truly caught on because it was more character based than action based . For those of us who don't care about action packed movies , I prefer a good drama with characters that you can identify with and sympathize . The series was serious and too sophisticated for most audiences today who prefer to escape from their daily troubles . Of course , good drama can still effective without car chases , violence , etc . Gabriel's Fire based on my memory was a decent show with a purpose but the network felt the audiences weren't enough for it to continue in another season .
489775	33913	92312	8.0	Jump for Jump Street	This was Fox's first serious drama . It was aimed at a young audience . 21 Jump Street had a great cast including a young Johnny Depp , Peter DeLuise , and Holly Robinson among the cast members , good writing , and innovative plot about young cops posing as high school students to capture a wide variety of criminals in the school system . The show lasted a few seasons on Fox without network infiltration like other major networks . It lasted long enough to leave its mark on the baby network . Now there are a dozen shows like 21 Jump Street without the cleverness and the strive to be better than just the average shows on TV . In fact , the show was probably the first American drama on Fox to be filmed on location in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada to cut costs . In the beginning of the Fox network lineup , 21 Jump Street launched a unique way of looking at secondary schools with a great cast . It was never awarded an Emmy which it should have been even nominated for Best Drama .
489985	33913	112095	8.0	One of the better sitcoms !	I really miss Newsradio because it was a great cast of eccentric characters and writers who knew how to write . The cast included Phil Hartman who was better known for his roles on Saturday Night Live during this tenure . He was a comic genius and sorely missed by his fans . The other cast members included Canada's Dave Foley from Kids in the Hall , Vicki Lewis as the useless secretary , Maura Tierney as the serious , intelligent and love interest of Dave's character . The cast also featured Stephen Root , an underrated actor , Joe Rogan , Andy Dick , Khandi Alexander , etc . The show's eccentric characters worked well together . When Phil's real life tragic death occurred , the cast and crew worked to remember him fondly and brought in fellow Saturday Night Live alum and close friend of Phil's , Jon Lovitz to replace the void . Of course , the show lasted a year . Much like another NBC sitcom , the show never truly recovered emotionally and maybe the audience couldn't get past it . We did accept and love Jon not as Phil's replacement .
489854	33913	90418	8.0	It should have been these four women !	One of things that bothered me about Designing Women was the loss of Delta Burke and Jean Smart leaving the show . Saturday Night Live's Jan Hooks and Newhart's Julia Duffy joined the cast but the show was never the same again . Alice Ghostley and Meshach Taylor were regulars in supporting roles . I remember watching this show on Monday nights when it first aired . They were four loud , opinionated , Southern broads with a sense of humor and chemistry . I truly could believe that Suzanne and Julia played by Dixie Carter and Delta Burke were sisters . I didn't care about Suzanne or Delta's weight . It wasn't an issue but people in Hollywood think that weight is a bigger issue than it should be . Anyway , I never saw the four women ever appear to be working . The place didn't look like an office but an actual house . I know they were supposed to be interior designers but I never saw them do any work . Anyway Annie Potts and Jean Smart were great as the divorced mom and single receptionist . I remember the episode in which Julia was a juror and she was invited to meet President Carter and his wife . Well she missed the dinner but they invited her for desert because of her obligations . It was a well-written show too and very well acted .
490621	33913	795833	8.0	Clever Twist and Insights of Naomi , Ellen , and Eunice !	In this episode , Mama Harper is in the kitchen making gooseberry jam with her loved ones , not her family , only kidding . Naomi and Ellen are already there but they are awaiting Eunice's arrival with the jars . For each of Naomi , Ellen and Eunice's versions , we get a better sense of how they see each other and themselves around Mother Harper . Mama is making gooseberry jam for a church function . Mama ends up in the hospital and Vint arrives to ask what happened to her . Naomi gives her version of the events in the kitchen . She sees herself as the loving daughter-in-law leaving out Ellen and Eunice . Then Eunice's event shows how she is the loving daughter who comes risking her life to deliver the jars . She sees Ellen with a crown like a Queen and she makes snide remarks to Eunice which we love to watch . Ellen's turn has her as the loving daughter and her mother as somewhat losing it .
489891	33913	284033	9.0	too short just like Dusty's life	I hesitated to watch this program before about Dusty Springfield's life . I thought it would spend too much time on personal life , sexuality , and addictions . But it was rather very pleasant and informative to watch people recall Dusty . For any Dusty fan , they would find this documentary as a short tribute . Unfortunately , it's too short and her brother , Tom O'Brien , is not in it . I respect Dusty's right to privacy but her love was celebrated in her music and she was very passionate about cats including her own . She would have made a wonderful mother . I still miss her after 3 years and this documentary is satisfactory for her fans . It's been 6 years since her death , the world is not the same without her .
490183	33913	68128	9.0	A Great Sitcom !	Redd Foxx made a lasting impression and impact on audiences in America when they took a British comedy , Steptoe & Son , which was more darker and depressing than Sanford and Son . They brought to America with Redd Foxx as the father Fred Sanford and his son , Demond Wilson , playing Lamont . Fred always cries that he's going to reunite with his wife , Elizabeth in heaven . Fred's sister-in-law Esther is played by the wonderful and hysterical LaWanda Page . I loved the interaction between Fred and Esther . It was a love and hate relationship on both ends of the spectrum . They would trade insults as champion boxers threw out punches . They were hysterical and unforgettable on screen .
490828	33913	158466	9.0	Almost as Perfect as the First Two !	Okay , Megan Follows owns the role of Anne Shirley after her fantastic performances in the original 1985 mini-series and it's 1987 sequel . In this film , Anne faces a world war with her beloved husband and soul mate , Gilbert Blythe abroad . She gets a child but not by ordinary means . The cast is still first rate but I think by now that I expected so much more with the final part of this trilogy . Unfortunately , Colleen Dewhurst had passed on in 1992 to the great stage in the sky and the role of Marilla Cuthbert could not have been played by anybody else . The producers took Anne abroad during World War I , I believe but I could be wrong but I don't think it was World War II . Anyway , if you are a big fan of the first two mini-series , you will appreciate Megan Follows in reprising the beloved role of Anne Shirley Blythe .
490427	33913	640544	9.0	Ellen's final appearance !	Ellen Harper Jackson hasn't been a good daughter since she blew off her Aunt Fran's funeral for a bridge tournament . She tries to make amends in this final appearance of Betty White who was now Rose Nylund on Golden Girls . Ironically , her co-star is Rue McClanahan who played Aunt Fran . Mama is playing scrabble with her family and Iola who is like family in the dining room when Ellen arrives with a gift to make amends . Ellen tries to apologize for not being there at the funeral . Regardless , Ellen is in the hospital for a procedure and the family learns that Ellen is there . Not knowing the kind of procedure , Mama and the gang head straight to the hospital without having dinner .
490423	33913	405422	9.0	Gays Came out of the Closet and The Virgins Went In !	Compared to the fact that anybody who is still a virgin is often ostracized by non-virgins for not getting . YOu wonder if it's all worth it whether it be the wrong or right person . This movie will please a lot of religious conservatives who make the presumption that you are any less because you are still a virgin . This movie allows a great comedian like Steve Carrell to play the oldest virgin known to mankind because he is so good at acting in general . We grow to admire and like this character unlike his television show . The fact that he has to come forward and admit his virginity is kind of like coming out of the closet . I love Jane Lynch . She is such a great actress and comedienne and deserves to be recognized . She is wonderful in Christopher GUest films and I saw her last night on Charlie Sheen's show and as always , she is wonderful . This movie is good to show for its lightheartedness and its attempt to be different . It's successful at that . It shows virginity in a positive light rather than as a freak show . There a lot more virgins out there but I'm not one of them sadly . I grew up where getting rid of your virginity was a top priority and how sad is that to give it to somebody who never calls you back .
489789	33913	808137	9.0	Let Conan host the Oscars !	And why not ? He did a wonderful job hosting the Emmy Awards . He made the time fly by and entertained the audience much like Billy Crystal did for the Academy Awards . I love the Bob Newhart segment . I don't think they would have let anything happen to him . I love the memoriam segment but I didn't think they should put the clip of Shelley Winters winning an Emmy . They should have shown a clip from the Roseanne show . Anyway everybody cheered when they showed DOn Knotts name and maybe he should have had a similar tribute as well like Aaron Spelling . I thought it was touching to see the clips , hear the theme songs , and realize how much Spelling meant to Los Angeles and everybody in the entertainment business . I loved seeing the original Charlie's Angels , Kate Jackson , Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith reunite to say goodbye to a television legend and icon . I just wished the SPelling family would patch up their differences and reunite as well . They shot a lot of Candy Spelling and Tori who sat on the other side of the auditorium . Candy was in tears next to Randy . Anyway , I loved the Dick Clark tribute and realize that he is no longer the teenage idol and Barry Manilow's tribute to him . I thought it was ironic that Simon Cowell introduced him . Poor Dick , I hope he is recognized and inducted into the Kennedy Center Honors this year and the National Medal of the Arts as well . All we can do is hope and pray that he gets better . My favorite moment is when Stephen Colbert addressed the audience as " godless sodomites . " I know he was only kidding .
490540	33913	78607	9.0	Sheer Entertainment !	I remember growing up and watching the Dukes of Hazzard on Friday nights before Dallas and Falcon Crest . The Duke boys were southern rebels . Of course , I grew wishing to be Daisy Duke . I loved Uncle Jesse played by Denver Pyle . I loved Sorrell Brooke in his white clothes . Of course , Enos was lovable . Who could forget his dog ? He was a hush puppy . I remember the auto mechanic who was the friend to the Duke boys . I loved the theme song played I believe by Waylon Jennings , the country star . Who could forget those awesome car chase or the way the Duke boys slid in and out of cars ? They never opened the doors but slid in and out . I always wanted to do that myself . I always thought those Duke boys were the sexiest men on television . They made a cinema film but you can't imagine anybody else playing those roles .
490326	33913	67778	9.0	Moving , controversial but lovable film	Louis Malle perhaps has directed his most controversial film about Laurent and his complicated relationship with his mother . Because he is the youngest of three boys , he is still a virgin and coddled like the family baby . The film seems to last forever but in a beautiful moving way . We watch as his beautiful Italian vivacious mother seems to attract admirers even her own son . Without discussing the film's oedipal issues , the film has some very pleasant scenes and some that are not so pleasant . Maybe Malle is trying to bring reality of a young body's sexuality . His two older brothers are not the sympathetic or kind older brothers to him especially . Laurent is truly the film's most important character but his mother is definitely the most important figure in his life . As he comes of age , she has to grasp with losing him to another woman , the inevitable outcome of any mother-son relationship . We learn a lot about Laurent's mother too in this film . While sexuality is another theme in this classic film , there are touching scenes between the Laurent and his mother . As he finds himself attracted to other women , he becomes daring , insulting and even unlikable . I won't give away the ending of this film . But it's worth watching even today more than 30 years later , I cannot believe it's older than me . It seems like it could have been done today and that's why it's a classic film .
489839	33913	329824	9.0	Give this Man , his Emmy !	Dr . Phil McGraw may not be one of my favorite talk show hosts but I do respect him as a serious psychologist who does his best to help his guests and his audience as well . Regardless of how you feel about his mentor , Oprah Winfrey , Dr . Phil has come into his own with this show . He tries to reason and help families dealing with relationships and issues about trust and boundaries . Sometimes , I don't think we set our boundaries or think about trusting our family members . We do relate because we have all had relative abuse our trust and cross the boundaries . Some of his shows have in-laws in battle which can seem fiercer than actual war battles . Dr . Phil spends an hour giving us the television therapy we need in our lives if we choose to watch him . If not , watch something else instead but please , he deserves an Emmy for always performing consistently .
490439	33913	299658	9.0	A Warning to Men : This could happen to you !	I think men don't have any idea about women . We don't ask for much - - love , respect , honesty , truth , understanding , sympathy , and we don't get it . When you screw with women , this could happen to you . The characters of Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart are quite unique - - they are played beautifully by Oscar nominee Renee Zellwegger and Oscar winner , Catherine Zeta Jones Douglas . I have to say that Richard Gere was robbed again of an Oscar nomination for his performance as Billy Flynn . Bob Fosse would be proud of this film . It incorporates his dance style which is darkness , black , hats , and just similar to Cabaret , one of the greatest musical films of all time . New York City Columnist , Cindy Adams has named this film one of her all time favorites . The movie was long overdue in the first place . Yes , it's dark and morbid . I can't forget Oscar nominee Queen Latifah as the prison matron . She did a good job . I like the fact that the film was not that much different than the musical . I can't imagine the musical to be any better than the film . For men out there , treat your ladies or significant others right or this could happen to you .
490055	33913	83413	9.0	Always funny and memorable to watch	I get nostalgic about television shows like Family Ties . It was based around two parents who graduated University of California at Berkeley in the sixties . It was wise to have their eldest son , Alex P . , to be on the opposite fence of politics . ALex with his tie and pictures of Ronald Reagan and Nixon . His younger sister , Mallory , played well by Justine Bateman cares more about fashion than grades or Alex's politics . It's great watching these two in action . The younger sister , Jennifer , develops from a young girl to an independent adolescent . There were always two story lines going on in every episode . Marc Price's SKippy is priceless for a thankless job . Scott valentine plays Mallory's boyfriend , Nick , a painter who never finished high school . Some of the best moments in this series happens after Nick enters the Keatons lives and his relationship with them . The mixture of great characters with witty dialogue . You can't stop laughing when Mr . Keaton tries to apologize to Nick in a ladies ' shoe store . He comes across as a former gay lover than the father of Mallory but it's full of laughs . Despite the witty dialogues , this was a believable family who introduced Andrew , the youngest and fourth child . What do the children think when they find out . " I was talking about closet space " Mallory says to Alex . Oh , this is truly a family show for everybody . I can't say how I miss a family centered show on such a wonderful family like the Keatons .
489836	33913	68049	9.0	Smart Comedies Don't Have to Be Dirty ! ! ! !	Okay , the Bob Newhart Show wasn't for everybody . I never got a chance to watch it on television . Now on DVD , I am discovering it for the first time . The writing is smart and the acting is smarter than ever with Bob Newhart in the title role as a Chicago psychologist , Susan Pleshette as his wife and third grade school teacher . They are great couple on screen . Surprisingly , they don't have children in the show which is a big plus because the show works better without them . Marcia Wallace is wonderful as his secretary . The show is smart , funny , savvy , relevant , and most of all timeless . It's a classic sitcom that might be overlooked because it's not dirty or stupid like most sitcoms are today . The Bob Newhart Show and others of that era are classic and timeless and relevant to today's life . Too bad , shows like that aren't being developed for television today . It's our loss , isn't it ?
489995	33913	47437	9.0	Can't Stop Loving Audrey !	So what if Audrey Hepburn's character , Sabrina Fairwood , has the worst Long Island or New York accent ! Audrey Hepburn won people over like fans , co-stars , and film directors . She was truly a classic and timeless beauty with a sense of style , class , and grace every time that she entered the room . Audrey Hepburn made you love her effortlessly just by being herself . Audrey's Sabrina becomes a woman with style after two years in Paris in a prestigious cooking school . When she returns as the chauffeur's daughter , David Larrabe ( played by William Holden ) finally take notice of her . Unfortunately , he has to marry a wealthy woman to maintain the family's wealth . His brother Linus Larrabe ( played by Humphrey Bogart ) has to steer Sabrina away from David or the wedding and plans for a merger are off . Hepburn steals the scenes out from Bogart and Holden hands down . The film is a classic because of her . Nobody else could have delivered Sabrina so well . I didn't realize that Ms . McArdle , Linus ' secretary , was played by Ellen Corby from the Waltons . Still It's a Wilder Classic . Maybe it should have been filmed in color .
489790	33913	85478	9.0	Another song to sing !	I remember when I first saw this film many years ago on television . I always feel like I'm returning home to those memories after twenty years . I love Julie Walters as Rita / Susan in the film , a hairdresser who aspires to become an intellectual . At first , she is not your typical college student . She is older , married , and not ready to have children with her husband . She seeks better . I remember how she nearly gave up when he invites her to dinner because she thought that she brought an inappropriate bottle of wine or champagne to her teacher's house . Anyway , her performance sparkles with sheer delight and Rita / Susan becomes an endearing character who has not forgotten her roots or her future . Anyway , she leaves the party without even going in afraid of being laughed at by the snobbery bunch of college intellectuals . Anyway , she goes to the bar where her family is and they're singing this ridiculous song " I'm so happy that you're so happy " and she witnesses her own mother crying and saying that they're must be a better song to sing and she decides to come back to class not that she is not met with pleasure by her own husband . He seems content with a home , wife , and child rather than his wife going out and becoming smarter and alive . Julie does a fantastic job at bringing her to life that you just can't imagine another person in this role . Anyway , Sir Michael Caine plays the drunken lost college professor who learns from his student , Rita / Susan as well . Michael Williams also has a role but you might know him better as being the husband to Dame Judi Dench . Anyway , the relationship between student and teacher despite a small age difference could have gone further and I wished it had but the movie does have a satisfying ending which is why I am giving it a 9 and not a ten . Anyway , the chemistry is there . Watching pros like Walters and Caine engage in conversation is worth watching again and again . Rita / Susan becomes who she wanted to be and that is an independent woman .
490354	33913	897919	9.0	Poor Reefer !	Reefer is the homeless guy played beautifully by Charles Haid I believe . Anyway it's a small role but he does a very good job in making us like this drunk homeless guy who lives across the street from the practice . Anyway , Sean hasn't recovered from his loss . He is devastated when his daughter Annie can't come to Miami for Christmas and begins drinking . He performs surgery intoxicated allowing a woman to experience an orgasm at the drop of a hat . Anyway , Christian's life is getting better with a new home , his son Wilbur , and his new fiancé Michelle . Of course , Michelle has yet to inform him of James ' true profession . You thought prostitution was bad , unfortunately , James befriends Reefer and you can figure out the rest if you know what's going on . There are humorous scenes like Sean playing Santa Claus and depressing the children who sit on his lap . Of course , don't forget his scene with the female dwarf .
489929	33913	441007	9.0	Everybody Should See Gracie !	Gracie is a great , family film . Gracie is played beautifully by Carly Shroeder as a girl surround by three soccer-playing brothers , Johnny , Mike , and Dan . The film opens as her brother has her kick a soccer ball barefoot to hit an empty bottle on top of the car . This film is set in South Orange , New Jersey in 1978 and is inspired by the events of the Shue family . Elisabeth Shue plays the mom and school nurse at Columbia High School in South Orange which does exist and whose alumni includes the Shues and Zach Braff . South Orange is also an upscale suburb of New York City and Newark , New Jersey . At the time of the movie set in 1978 , an average dual income working class couple with four children could live comfortably there . South Orange has become an upscale white collar community ever since 1978 to feature celebrity residents like Kelly Bishop and Andre Braugher . Also , South Orange is home to Seton Hall University . The film was filmed on location around New Jersey including Maplewood where we see Gracie running on a downtown street . It was a family affair in the filming process including Elisabeth Shue not only as an actress but as an executive producer along with her husband and director , Davis Guggenheim . Her brother Andrew Shue plays an assistant soccer coach and history teacher . In real life , Andrew played soccer too . Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the father , coach , and moving man in his profession . At first , the family has a star , Johnny Bowen , but tragedy strikes the family . We see Gracie rebelling against her parents who are already heartbroken with despair over their loss as well . The two younger brothers seem unaffected at least in the movie . Gracie has one best female friend who is afraid of being labeled a lesbian because of her association with Grace . She decides one night to take her brother's spot on the team much to her father's laugh . She is serious but rather than prepare and strive . She rebels , dates a boy , fails history , and plays hooky at Asbury Park with a college boy . Until her father decides that he will coach her to get on the team , there are difficulties since she is a girl but she is determined and the film is not entirely predictable . It is a family oriented . It's just in time for Father's Day ! The film is somewhat believable and realistic at times . They do their best to maintain the authenticity of the time and playing Bruce Springsteen songs as well . I admire the Shues for their determination in making the film entirely on location in New Jersey keeping with their roots . Stay until the end of the credits , you will be interested to see what it has to say . I like this film overall and it's message is that a girl can do it too .
490200	33913	271894	9.0	Not the Movie !	I was watching 48 Hours on Saturday nights because they focus on murder cases like Katherine Woods case and others on a weekly basis . They go into detail of a case , talk with suspects , witnesses , friends , relatives , and others about the case as well as the prosecutors , policemen , and defense attorneys . They also help us understand the community and environment where these crimes happen . Of course , they talk about injustices , legal talk , and the case at hand . Trials can be both boring and exciting at the same time . The show has changed from being investigative to focusing on one subject to help us understand the story which is always reality . It's always frightening how potent the truth can be . How people who look like you and me could be involved in such horrendous crimes ? Especially when the victim is close member of the family , spouse , friend , etc . Recently , they had done the Napa murders and are going to do an hour on the Atlantic City Murders which has not been solved . They also follow up on cases like the Katherine Woods case too .
489914	33913	181618	9.0	Classic Independent Film !	This film has a first rate cast including some famous faces like the wonderful and missed Madeline Kahn , the brilliant and subtle Barbara Barrie , the under-appreciated Julie Kavner , and Emmy Winner Edie Falco in the title role as an aspiring actress from Long Island . The suburbia has become the new it thing . Of course , suburbia is not as boring as we like to make it out to be on screen . There are some brilliant moments and casting of Barrie and Falco as mother and daughter is perfect casting . Kahn plays the bored housewife and loving mother who needs assurance from her husband played by Bob Dishy who is a school principal where Berlin's mother Sue works as a teacher . Kavner plays a cafeteria lady while Anne Meare plays his secretary . It's shot in black and white which is a departure from the normal color . The shots are quite first rate and the film has a slow but steady peace . The characters are realistic at least to my lifelong suburban eyes . I can identify with almost all of them .
490127	33913	96657	9.0	Almost Brilliant Comedy !	Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr . Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear . The appeal of Mr . Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence . We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet . He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily . He is often alone and used to it . He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times . There are other characters who speak to him and he responds . The character of Mr . Bean is a mystery and still is . He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing . Mr . Bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much . He rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time .
490407	33913	80974	9.0	Missing Info ! but faithful to the Glaspell's play !	It should be Trifles which is faithful to the Susan Glaspell one act play of the same name . It would have been nice to have the cast and crew names to note and compliment or criticize them there but I don't know their names or I would do the deed . Anyway , the short film is faithful to the one act play and it's superbly done . Susan Glaspell would be proud to see this film . The actresses do an admirable job in portraying the local townswomen and the actors do an adequate job in probing the case against an unhappy married woman who kills her husband but why . I won't spoil it . You just have to watch if possible . I was lucky because my college professor , Ellen Gruber Garvey , worked on the film with the director in the film crew but even she's not listed nor is the cast and crew which is a terrible shame because they deserve to be recognized .
490222	33913	749289	9.0	Rest in Peace , Lana Clarkson !	Oh what might have been if Lana Clarkson had finally gotten the break she deserved in this cruel industry of Hollywood . In only a couple of minutes , she plays Janine who works for a Nantucket plastic surgeon . Even in only the couple of minutes she was on the air , she was radiant , funny , and talented . She had it all except the opportunity to strut her talents . She was no dumb blonde at all . In fact , she was beautiful , smart , and funny . I only wished that her death wouldn't overshadow her career which was her life . Anybody could have done the job but Lana in this episode gives a hundred percent . I wonder what might have been if she had gotten the dream job that she richly deserved in life . I only wished there was more of her in this episode or that the producers brought her back to play one of Brian Hackett's many girlfriends . She was great .
490747	33913	97082	9.0	Very Entertaining !	Soap stars Ian Buchanan from General Hospital and the always beautiful Deirdre Hall from Days of Our Lives are involved in a disappearance and possible murder of a publisher . Of course , this brings a slew of much needed publicity for a starving magazine . Gigi Rice has a role as well . It's a familiar story with Ian playing a British Hugh Hefner style younger man and his empire in financial ruins . His partner is played by the beautiful Deidre Hall ( she hasn't aged in years ) wants out of the business . Of course , the motive is about money . Columbo episodes try to use simple motives rather than complex and the crimes are always pretty simply done whether it is done with a gun . We are never truly left with a gruesome crime scene in Columbo episodes and that's a good thing because Columbo has always been light-hearted at heart and his interactions with the prime suspect is always fascinating . When he thinks he's wrong , he's not .
490829	33913	138083	9.0	Bring back the after school specials ! We Need Them !	Seasonal Differences had a great cast including the wonderful , incomparable Uta Hagen as a Holocaust survivor Omi and family matriarch . Her Jewish American granddaughter played by Canadian actress Megan Follows who is under-rated , is dating a non-Jewish boy . Friction occurs at school when the nativity scene raises highbrows and causes problems among religions . What I remember most about this after-school special was the seriousness and delicate approach that was made to understanding two people from different religions , Judaism and Christianity . The special was special because it taught and displayed religion as a positive rather than negative around the holiday time . When her boyfriend and Omi talk about Christmas presents , he makes a negative remark but Christmas is about miracles in general . We need miracles no matter what faith you are in this day . Seasonal Differences was a great example of teaching students and teens like I was about respecting and tolerating differences and sharing them and celebrating them too .
490416	33913	68611	9.0	Not one of the Master Hitchcock's Best but not the worst either !	Watching Frenzy from Sir Alfred Hitchcock is quite fascinating . The cast features the great Billie Whitelaw C . B . E . , Clive Swift ( Keeping Up Appearances ) , Jean Marsh ( who should be awarded Damehood by now ) , the unforgettable Vivian Merchant in a great small role as the cop's wife who likes to cook French cuisine . Of course , Anna Massey who plays one of the victims . In the murder sequence featuring Barbara Leigh Hunt ( another British actress worthy of a British honor and is one of Dame Judi Dench's very best friends and the godmother to her only child ) was difficult but yet unbelievable to watch . Just when you think he might let her live , you are wrong . She is the first murder victim and the whole rape and murder is shown explicitly . We know who the killer is all along but we don't know how they are going to catch in the act . The murder of Anna Massey was done differently because once they entered his character's apartment . The door becomes closed to us as the spectator . We don't know how bad it is until later . So watching how the murderer escapes from this one is quite unforgettable . You think he'll get caught and the movie is worth watching because of the London locations alone .
490277	33913	79417	9.0	A Movie Still Relevant Today !	I saw Kramer v . Kramer on video and it still touches my soul . The original score is excellent . I love the fact that they filmed in New York City by showing the sights and sounds of New York in 1979 . I thought Meryl Streep showed that she's a scene stealer in this film and deserved her academy award as well as Dustin Hoffman did for Best Actor . Jane Alexander is superb as the supportive divorcée and single mother Margaret . Justin Henry proved his acting abilities as a young ten year old in this special role . The direction of the film moves quite decently for this melodrama . Films about divorce have come and gone but this film is still a classic because it seems so genuine , real , and authentic . If you have a first rate cast , writing , and a great director , Robert Benton , the film is an American classic in the same sense as Ordinary People . It's still a movie that everybody can relate too .
490498	33913	80319	10.0	So Funny that you'll cry laughing !	What a combination of great talent in this cast and that includes Oscar nominees Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton with 2-time Oscar winner Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman playing their despicable boss . Remember when typewriters were the computers of our time and on every office desktop imaginable . Anyway , I liked Peggy Pope and Marian Mercer as well but you can't top Tomlin as divorced mother of four Viola , Dolly's Doralee happily married to a country singer , and Jane's Judy who is not always goody two shoes . The three women become friends and smoke a joint after their boss played brilliantly by Dabney Coleman . I think the cast just had such a grand old time making this movie that there is still talk of a reunion and the four major cast members reunited last year for Jane's charity benefit in Atlanta , Georgia . I loved the scenes where they imagined giving Hart played by Coleman , a taste of his own medicine . The kidnapping is also worth watching as well . I can't forget Sterling Hayden . This comedy is one of the all-time classic comedies especially about working environments and women's rights . When these three women take charge , they make changes that brought differences to the working place where their employees became better people which means happier employees . I guarantee if you are an employer and you want a productive environment , you have to have a happy working staff regardless of the cost .
490199	33913	68120	10.0	Won't Be the Same Without You , Bob !	I can't imagine anybody else than Bob Barker hosting the Price is Right . After all , he has been hosting for decades . Now in his youthful eighties , he is retiring . No longer will he be the game show host or retired . The game show is based on the normal people , randomly chosen by the show's announcer to come on down to be one of the four bidders . Once you win the closest bid to the item , you win the item and get on stage with Bob Barker which must be a thrill in itself . If you're lucky , you make it to the final round and get a chance to bid on possibly a new car , expensive vacations , etc . You can win both showcases if bid under a hundred dollars on your showcase . The show won't be the same without him . He's the heart and soul of the show . They named the studios after him . Nobody could fill Bob Barker's spot now or never !
489951	33913	151804	10.0	A great film !	When I first saw , Office Space , I couldn't believe how somebody in Hollywood could create a comic masterpiece . I have worked in offices for years and I totally recommend this film to all office employees . I love Ron Livingston's character as the unhappy coworker ready to explode any minute . When he finally changes after being hypnotized , he becomes a happier person . He gets to tick off his boss most of all . I love the beginning where everybody bothers him about the TPS report covers like they are the most important things in the world . When the company begins to screw around with their employees , watch out for Milton , he's brilliantly played by under-appreciated Stephen Root . The monotony of the offices , cubicles , and the life it creates is not what God put us on earth for is exactly what this movie searches for . These characters are more real to me than anything I have seen in the movies or television . I know what it's like to loathe Mondays and wish to be left alone to stare into space for hours at a time . I know slavery didn't end in 1865 . It just took a different form . I am one of the lucky ones because i work for the state . But I feel for those companies that once created family oriented environments . You can sense the desperation . While I enjoy the movie , there are laughs along the way . MAD TV alums Orlando Jones and David Herman also star . Jennifer Aniston plays a waitress who sets Ron Livingston's character on the right path . I loved Gary Cole as the annoying boss .
489820	33913	83866	10.0	Almost Perfect !	Okay , maybe it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture instead of Ghandhi . It had a great storyline of a young boy Elliot , played by Henry Thomas , who bonds with an alien named E . T . for Extra Terrestial . Of course , people like Peter Coyote is soon out to capture the alien from Elliott's home . His mother , Dee Wallace , is perfectly cast as the divorced mother of three who is unsuspecting of the creature in her home . As a nine year old when this film came out , I was envious the actors who played Elliott and Gertie played none other by Drew Barrymore , a descendant of American acting royalty . The film is a classic family film which should brings families together . I don't think it's my favorite Spielberg film of all time . that would be Jaws . I could watch that film a hundred times and still go in the water but E . T . is a tear-jerker and you might want to keep your Kleenex in reaching distance when you watch this film . I will always treasure the memory of my father who took me and my sister to see this film at the cinema .
490131	33913	375063	10.0	Brilliant American Story of Two Men Making A Journey Together !	The casting is first rate although at the time , the actors Paul Giamati and Thomas Haden Church and the actresses Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen were barely members of the A-list . This film is quite a feast of fun and at times quite sad . Miles played beautifully by Giamati is a school teacher who aspires to be a published writer . His best friend Jack who is engaged to get married a week from the day that they start a journey is beautifully played by Thomas Haden Church whose best known roles for his sitcom characters on Wings and Ned and Stacey . Virginia Madsen plays the waitress and graduate student , Maya , and divorcée . She makes the role her own . Sandra Oh better known for her role on Grey's Anatomy is too brilliant as Stephanie who falls for Jack . Not everything goes according to their plan , it wouldn't be a great film if it did .
490683	33913	173528	10.0	Terrific Show for Kids and Adults	Bill Nye is an established scientist and comedian from Almost Live with fellow announcer Pat Cashman . His show is very enjoyable , informative , and entertaining . I wish it was around when I was a kid . I learn more from him than any science teacher in my life . He has one topic on his show and he sells it easily like the forest . He can produce a music video to help sell the forest and he even used a supermarket type idea for kids . Even adults with college education without children can enjoy it . I love his outdoors in Seattle and guest stars . It's too bad the show is no longer being produced . He has a new show filmed of course in his beloved Seattle , Washington . Bill Nye is truly one of a kind . He is today's answer to Mr . Wizard . His show should still be repeated on public stations for adults and children audiences . He provides entertainment as well as education .
490232	33913	6864	10.0	Unforgettable !	D . W . Griffith whether you like him or not is one of the pioneer film directors of all time . Watching Intolerance , you can witness his genius . The filming is extraordinary . The visuals are phenomenal . THe acting is equally impressive since the voice couldn't be heard . It was not until 10 years later that we heard sound in the films . The casting is large . This film would have won Best Picture Academy Award for that year if there was an Academy . No wonder people went to the picture shows repeatedly because it would take more than once to see and grasp the magnitude of that is wonderful brilliant film in it's early stages . Film directors like D . W . Griffiths had his problems and I don't condone the racism in Birth of A Nation but I can forgive him because it was almost 100 years and life was much different then for him and this country . Anyway , Intolerance is a brilliant film overall . When they say a picture says a thousand words , this film says a million words . It can now be viewed as art and should be appreciated .
490343	33913	375679	10.0	Breathtaking , horrifying , and yet probably the best film of the year !	In Hollywood , they should just look outside their walls and gates for a good story . They don't have to travel very far . The story of Crash is complicated to describe but it is an ensemble piece with an excellent cast like Matt Dillon who plays the racist cop with sick father at home fighting with an African American HMO representative for coverage . He takes his anger out on a successful African American couple . Thandie Newton is unrecognizable and believable as the light skinned wife of a successful television director who gets felt up by Dillon's character and humiliated but in the end , there is something called redemption that these characters seek and need to prove that they are not the cruel , heartless , caricatures of society . Matt Dillon's character is a veteran Los Angeles Police Detective but a racist filled with anger and hatred . I hope he is not overlooked for his performance in this film . By the end of it , I wanted more and I saw this film on an airplane screen but I was glued to every word and scene . Brendan Fraser is miscast as the Los Angeles District Attorney . He is just too young . I love William Fichtner who has been around for years and finally getting noticed . Sandra Bullock is wonderfully complicated as Brendan's wife . They both survive a carjacking and are distrustful . The Persian man who loses his place of business because of a break-in and vandalism is also heartbreaking but you end up liking him and feeling sorry for him in the end but who suddenly has hope for the future despite losing everything to hatred . This film is a lot about hatred , prejudice , racism , sexism , and it is also about redemption of the characters . Don Cheadle is also wonderful in his role . I hope the Oscars don't forget about them one bit . It's the film that is worth watching again and again . You want more when it's over and you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films about life in Los Angeles . Finally , the Oscars votes came in and Crash won . The controversy over the other film is ridiculous and the most absurd . This film was not meant to win an Oscar for best film . It was the little film that could . When Haggis directed it , he was not thinking about how many awards this would win for him but the message of optimism in a pessimistic society . I'm glad Crash won over the other film . Roger Ebert named this film of the year in his annual top ten . The other film came in 5 . In my opinion , I think the Academy was right in selecting this film . Yes , this film has just as much controversy as the other film does . I won't name it because it's not worth mentioning . It was the upset of the night and I would have loved to have watched it on television but I fell asleep and woke up to the news .
490072	33913	51459	10.0	Packs a punch !	I am big fan of Tennessee Williams ' A Streetcar Named Desire . Finally , I watched a video film of this yesterday and it still packs a punch . Imagine all the events take place in one day . Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Dame Judith Anderson playing southern wives and belles but they're not weak just desperate . Madeleine Sherwood deserved a Best SUpporting Actress nomination for her performance . I think she proved that she can handle the heat in the kitchen with those dames and of course , Paul Newman and Burl Ives . I felt sorry for this family who had lived the American dream . It's quite a tragedy . Brick and Maggie are trapped in a marriage which make neither one of them happy . HIs brother Goober and his wife , Mae , have provided plenty of heirs for the family fortune to a grandfather who does everything to avoid the children or Maggie puts it " little monsters . " I kind of felt sorry for Goober and Mae being treated like second class citizens for the favorite , Brick and Maggie . Of course , Mae isn't attractive but she breeds like a rabbit . Goober went to law school and has done everything to please his father , Big Daddy , but nothing does . Even his wife , Big Mama is trapped in a marriage . Nobody is really happy here . The casting of Larry Gates and Madeleine Sherwood is excellent and all the actors do a fantastic job especially creating SOuthern accents like Dame Judith and Dame Liz . I don't think you can remake this film to create the kind of magic and chemistry that this cast has already established . Burl Ives gives the best performance of the bunch here . It really is his movie . He created the role of Big Daddy on Broadway before bringing it to film . This is his WIlly Loman role that Lee J . Cobb made famous . I wouldn't want to see a live stage production after this of this play . This film is colorful , brilliant , tragic , and yet so human the entire time .
490533	33913	109830	10.0	One of the best , moving , memorable films of the 1990s !	When I hear the music , I think of how wonderful the world can truly be if there were more Forrest Gumps out there . When the film came out , it was truly breathtaking . It showed that the great and talented Tom Hanks can perform anything . Had this film been released a year before ? He would have probably have gotten his first Academy Award for Best Actor . Truthfully , his role in Philadelphia was good but not Forrest Gump . We don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that he played a Philadelphia attorney dying of AIDS and suing for justice for his termination . While the film , Philadelphia is good . It's not Forrest Gump . What separates Forrest Gump from Philadelphia is that there is so much more going on around the character . I think it's a shame that Sally Field did not get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for playing his mother and Robin Wright also did not get a nomination for Best Supporting ACtress for playing the love of FOrrest's life . They were some of the best female performances of that year alone . When you hear the music or the soundtrack , you are reminded of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly remarkable character named Forrest Gump . Gary Sinise was also worth mentioning because he was nominated for BEst Supporting Actor as the man's Vietnam comrade who he saved . That touching moment of when Forrest realizes his gratitude for saving his life is still chilling and touching and remarkable like the film .
490161	33913	280778	10.0	Excellent Cast ! But not enough time !	Dame Judi Dench is arguably one of the greatest mature actresses of our time period . She is playing another dame , Iris Murdoch . I would have loved if they focused the film somewhat on Iris ' success . She won the Booker Prize for the Sea , the Sea . She was awarded Commander of the British Empire and a Dame in 1987 , a year before Judi's honor . Judi Dench really pours her heart and soul in this role and it shows . Jim Broadbent who declined a Queen's honor in reality is brilliant in his role as the older John Bayley . Their relationship is quite enduring . They focus too much on Iris ' early sexuality as a way to maybe attract attention of film goers to go and see this film . If they did withhold it , it would have been seen on Masterpiece Theatre . I read two of Iris ' books , The Bell and The Sea , The Sea . They are both philosophical , intelligent products of fiction . John is absolutely right when he says that Iris lives for words and they are her life . The scenes with the older Iris and John are more important than the younger versions of themselves . I think there was a creative difference in depicting Iris as free-thinking , smoking , young lady rather than the mature , intelligent , private woman of her day . The film is a 10 because of Dench and Broadbent's performances . I liked seeing Penelope Wilton play the older Janet Stone , her longtime friend . One of the subjects that I wished they would explore would have been Iris and John's decision not to have any children . The film also withholds Iris ' platonic relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre . Iris and John loved swimming and that was evident in this film . I would have liked to have seen their wedding ceremony . I am not much of a Kate Winslet fan so I never really cared to see her playing younger Iris as a silly , manipulative schoolgirl . I found her Iris to be too selfish . Dench's Iris was much more caring and loving toward John and Janet . Somebody wrote that we can learn a lot about relationships by being more like John and Iris . That is so true . They were really soul mates from the beginning of their relationship and in the end too . John and Iris worked because they allowed the other live and do with absolute trust . Most people are unaware that they lived in squalid conditions in Oxford and that they did not have a television until Iris ' illness . They listened to the Archers ' radio program on BBC . They lived quietly . Iris donated much of her income from books to charities . When this film came out , I learned about Dame Iris Murdoch and read about her . I am still fascinated by her even watching Judi play as she declined away . Iris said about losing your mind when you live in your mind . If we all lived in our minds , it would be a much happier world . Rest in peace , Dame Iris Murdoch , you are not forgotten . If this film does anything , it is promote interests in your novels and open our minds .
489762	33913	488826	10.0	Now these were Celebrities !	Dean Martin was one of America's greatest legends in the entertainment industry . He is sorely missed even to this day . He honors or roasts his beloved friend and American icon , Frank Sinatra , in one of his many roasts . In my opinion , even the half-hour infomercial is far more entertaining than anything on television today . I miss people like Dean Martin , Frank Sinatra , and so many others . There are more people who are gone than living with us like Don Rickles , Peter Falk , and Ruth Buzzi . Frank Sinatra's roast is pretty relaxed from what we know . We're glad to see celebrities cut loose and be themselves and poke fun at this man . Nobody will ever have the roasts that Dean ever put together in Las Vegas . Of course , people were smoking cigarettes ( God forbid that you display any smoking on television anymore ) and drinking liquor and being human anymore . Those days are gone forever and now you have a bit of history with these episodes . Even though they drank and smoke , they always appear to be having fun at themselves .
490204	33913	96697	10.0	What the Simpsons have done that no other show can do ?	Let's face it , the Simpsons popularity has grown over the last twenty years ever since it made it's debut on the Tracey Ullman Show . Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson . Being an animated show has it's advantages though , gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices . The show works because of the powers behind the show's success . Maggie is still a baby , Bart is still a brat , and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart . The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself . In live sitcoms , the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another . There are episodes that are good and plentiful . They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe . I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more . They'll be happy to comply .
489988	33913	310793	10.0	Brilliant , Tragic , and yet an American Classic !	Flint's Michael Moore began his documentary film career by digging his claws into the closing of General Motors in his beloved hometown of Flint , Michigan which has become a ghost town and looks more like Hurricane Katrina had struck it than the closing of it's largest employer . Economic and social depression has brought Flint into great despair . Michael MOore doesn't forget Flint in any of his films . I watched Bowling for Columbine on television and I was blown away . Michael Moore's editing skills and film techniques acts to show the effects of his message . In a country of guns , he shows the inner cities of Detroit , Los ANgeles , and New York CIty . He also shows us how the tragic events on that April day in 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colorado made us wake up even if only for a little while . I think it's poignant that Marilyn Manson said " I would just listen " regarding Erik Harris and Dylan Klebold . Maybe that's what we're not doing in a country where guns are more prolific than health care for individuals , our priorities appear insane . While some people I know might call Michael MOore as anti-American . He is doing these documentaries because he loves his country . SOmetimes constructive criticism helps us make better writers and we shouldn't dismay Moore's stance against the proliferation of guns . When Flint is hit with the youngest shooter killing a six year old girl , Kayla , Moore visits the school , comforts the principal , watches the local news coverage , and digs into the boy's background . His mother is on a welfare work force employed by Dick Clark at one of his themed restaurants in wealthy Auburn Hills , Michigan where she has to take a bus to and from . She and her children were evicted and living with her brother in the meantime where the six year old boy found his uncle's handgun and brought it to school for what show and tell . The mother was working two jobs because the welfare forced her too to pay back the government . Dick Clark pulls away from Moore's questioning . Oscar Winner and NRA spokesman Charlton Heston also walks away from Moore in the end when he wants an apology to the girl's family in Flint . Moore leaves a picture of her behind to remind him . The film is unforgettable and a classic .
490544	33913	92324	10.0	Too Good for Television !	We could still use Black Adder even today . Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie . Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant . I love the episode which Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian . Every time , Edmund says Macbeth . The two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits . It's the funniest things that you will see . Of course , none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who are also behind the films like Love Actually , The Thin Blue Line , Four Weddings and A Funeral . Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television . Humor can be smart , sexy , and funny all at one . I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his background in British humor . If the gang at SNL did some research , they would know what a treasure it was to have Hugh Laurie grace their stage .
490424	33913	190332	10.0	Ang Lee's Best Film to Date as of 2006	First , I don't think it matters that there are subtitles and the language is Chinese . The story is strong and moves along smoothly . The fighting scenes are worth watching alone . The actors are choreographed to dance and fight with you just wanting to see who defeats . The story is also told with great costumes , art direction , and scenery . The stars of this film are Asian actors and actresses who don't get enough work in this business . While the subtitles might throw you off , it's not hard to understand what's going on by studying their actions , movements , and facial expressions . If Ang Lee had the actors talk in English throughout the film , I don't think it would have lost much value to me since I'm not Asian or Chinese or the audience . I believe that this is one of the best foreign language films of the last decade and it was awarded an Oscar for Foreign Language Film . Although I don't think Ang Lee cared about awards in making this film , this film has female characters who are both strong and equal to the male characters in the film . The females sometimes steal the scenes from the men . It's nice to see women portrayed as strong , equals than emotional inferior characters . They are equally adept at the fighting scenes and they give their all to those scenes . When you think of Ang Lee's other films , nothing could really master the beauty and uniqueness of Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon .
490517	33913	106028	10.0	Best Cop Show Ever !	I still miss a show like this drama . It had a first cast , crew , and writing that no other show on television had until that point . Andre Braugher ( I love you ) , Kyle Secor , Melissa Leo , David Belzer , Ned Beatty , Isabell Hoffman , Stephen Baldwin , etc . I only wished that they didn't get rid of Leo's character , Kay Howard , who I think was the best female heterosexual cop on television up there with Cagney and Lacey . I like the real life and on screen relationship between Hoffman and Baldwin . Let's put it to you this way , when they did the reunion film , everybody in the cast and crew reunited which is amazing because this cast and crew worked so well together that they formed relationships that would last a lifetime . Braugher's Emmy winning performance as Frank Pendleton is amazing and unforgettable . The show shot much of it on location in Baltimore itself and that city became part of the show's unique character .
490709	33913	473254	10.0	A Year in the Life of An Amazing Park !	Rittenhouse Square is more than just a park to Philadelphia . In it's creation , it was initial purpose was for residents and visitors to the city to enjoy the trees . A century ago , the neighborhood was surrounded by lavish townhouses and the wealthiest of Americans like John Wanamakerlived nearby . The park was used as it is today for people to relax and enjoy a life a little more . Rittenhouse Square is a lot smaller than New York's Central Park or Philly's Fairmount Park but it is still one of the city's finest parks for couples to meet and fall in love , to hear music , to dance at the annual ball , to meet friends , to have lunch , to paint , etc . Rittenhouse Square reminds you of the parks in London neighborhoods if you been there . Maybe that's why it's so special . Size doesn't always matter in park size and Rittenhouse Square has survived and thrived and changed it's image from prams and nannies to alternative lifestyles , seniors , adults , college students , residents , visitors , and they enjoy the scene of nature in the city surroundings . The park is just as enjoyable in winter as it is in spring , summer , and fall . This documentary is a tribute to the legacy of Rittenhouse Square .
490335	33913	88683	10.0	Excellent All Around Film	When Anne Bancroft died this past year , I remembered this film because of her performance . I can't forget Jane Fonda and Meg Tilly's as well . The three actresses really provided some of their finest performances for the camera . We are left with more questions than answers . But as we go through watching this film , we love Anne's role as the Mother Superior with a few secrets of her own and Jane Fonda as the psychiatrist assigned to Sister Agnes . I love the interaction between Fonda and Bancroft . They're professionals and they're good in this film . That's why the three earned Academy Award nominations . Finally a film about nuns that's not so demeaning or patronizing . Mother Superior joins the convent for her reasons or because she felt chosen to do God's work . Sister Agnes and Mother Superior's relationship is not so obvious to the viewer . YOu have to take into account every word of what is said between these three characters . You feel sorry for Fonda's childless lonely character as well . In the end , we have more questions than answers that are never really resolved but it's a great film and one of Anne's best work .
489841	33913	90493	10.0	The Queen of Talk Shows ! ! !	Let's face it , England has Queen Elizabeth II and America has Oprah Winfrey . While she might be only a talk show hostess , she already commands a billion dollar empire which includes her show , magazine , radio station , television channel , etc . She is the first African American woman to be a billionaire but also represents those of us who strive to achieve as well . Oprah's show is expected to run it's course in 2011 and please say it isn't show . Can we imagine life without her show ? Probably not , it wouldn't be same . I knew she was going to be big but as a success story when I first saw her after Color Purple and her academy award nomination . I never imagined her to be so successful beyond her wildest dreams . Oprah's show is always first rate most of the time . You may like her or dislike her but you can't avoid her show's influence and hers as well . Too bad , her film version of Beloved didn't win her an Academy Award because she deserved it . Oprah's book choices become best-sellers even though I disagree with some of her choices as too feminine and emotional . She chooses books that will make us better people . Enjoy her now while you still can because when she retires from her show , television would never be the same .
490506	33913	64400	10.0	An Excellent Condition !	So far , the film version of Tony Richardson's adaptation has been more than satisfactory . This is a must for Shakespeare fans . Nicol Williamson who should have been knighted by now which bothers me more than anything else that he has not been quite rewarded is brilliant in his role as Hamlet . He even outshines Sir Anthony Hopkins C . B . E . who plays his uncle , Claudius . I know Nicol has some personal problems which makes him a very difficult actor to work aside but he is brilliant and talented actor . Maybe he has stayed away from acting rather than go insane or mad . The scenes where his Hamlet is going mad is better than Lord Laurence Olivier . You really believe it . Some people have preferred his Hamlet to other actors who have played the role in the past . I am sure Nicol Williamson deserves to be there somewhere in the top ten list of great Hamlets . Being an artist like an actor without going crazy , mad or insane is an amazing accomplishment . For Nicol , I think he was blessed and cursed with talent and yet with difficulty . I am not excusing his difficult behavior but he is one of the most talented actors and should be rewarded with knighthood like his peers who have taken on the role of Hamlet like Sir Ian McKellen , Sir Derek Jacobi , Sir John Gielgud , Lord Laurence Olivier , Kenneth Branagh ( C . B . E . refused honor in 1996 ) , and others . I hope people will also recognize Judy Parfitt as Queen Gertrude who is quite wonderful in the role . Marianne Faithful plays Ophelia but it is really Nicol's film and worth watching again .
490123	33913	97123	10.0	Brilliant ! One of Woody's Best Work to Date !	Look we all know Woody Allen is a neurotic Jewish New Yorker . In this film , he plays an unsuccessful Jewish New York film director of documentaries . He finally gets a job working for Alan Alda's character who has an enormous ego and thinks the world of his own comedy . The cast is first rate with Woody Allen writing and directing this superior work , Mia Farrow who was his life partner , the divine Claire Bloom who should have been made Dame by now , Martin Landau who plays the guilt stricken husband , Angelica Huston as his unstable mistress , Jerry Orbach who was Mr . New York as Landau's brother in the film , Joanna Gleason who plays the unhappy wife with Woody Allen in this film while he pursues Mia's character Hally Reed . There is also Caroline Aaron who plays Woody's sister . She is a remarkable character actress who goes unnoticed . There are so many wonderful characters who are real but self-centered in some way . They are all with problems but not financially . You wonder how Woody's character who barely worked in years survives a Manhattan rent ? Of course , you can't forget that it's really about Jewish American life in New York City as well . Woody has not forgotten his Jewish roots in his films . Regardless , this film is always worth watching for the first rate cast , writing , and directing . When Woody shoots a film about New York , it's done in New York City and you feel the difference . Of course , Woody is a genius with lots of problems but I think that's the price you pay with being brilliant and gifted . I think he uses his films to sort out his problem .
490208	33913	26725	10.0	Vive Les Miserables !	I thought this was an excellent early version of Victor Hugo's classic . The actor who plays Valjean does an excellent job as does British actor Charles Laughton who plays Javert who chases him for years . I love the film even though it might be dated but it's still faithful to the classic novel . The actresses who play Cosette and Fantine do an excellent job even though they are supporting parts . The film's quality is still excellent even though it was done over seventy years ago in the early stages of talking movies . I still think it's a classic movie and of the novel's best . This film version does not have the music but it still contains the same message of Victor Hugo's novel . Valjean is beautifully played as is Javert in this film .
489796	33913	866227	10.0	This Episode is A Winner !	This episode should be submitted for the Emmys and Golden Globe Awards . It is truly one of the best episodes that I have seen of this show and reminds me why I love this show so much . We learn more about Sean's past and we understand him better as to why he wants his son to look normal so much . Dylan Walsh's scenes in this episode are brilliantly portrayed with complex of emotions . Julian McMahon also gives a brilliant performance without showing any of his flesh . If you watch this show regularly , you know that's rare and refreshing . His relationship with one of his patients , Hedda Grubman , is touching and sincere . Hedda is a wealthy widow who cares more about her appearance than anything else who was willing to sacrifice relationships in order to save her vanity . I don't know if it was Burt Bacharach in the show but I wouldn't be surprised . This season has been filled with A list guest stars like Brooke Shields , Larry Hagman , Catherine Denueve , Jacqueline Bissett , Richard Chamberlain , etc . The actress who played Hedda Grubman deserves an Emmy for guest performance in a drama . She was excellent and so was Joely Richardson as the concerned Julia .
490753	33913	77353	10.0	One of the best Columbo !	George C . Scott's wife Trish Van Devere gives an excellent and memorable performance as a woman scorned by her secret boyfriend and network executive . I can't blame her character for being so upset . Her longtime secret male companion treats her like leftover meat . He plans to go to New YOrk City and take a top network job while she is treated with no indifference since she is the backbone and force behind the network . She makes few bad decisions but she knows too much and she feels used time and time again . I love her discussions with Columbo . They get along pretty well . Lainie Kazan has a supporting role playing a celebrity with a lot of personal and emotional problems . Too bad , there a not a lot of top television female executives around . The killing of her boss and lover shows that you don't mess with a strong , smart woman and expect to buy her love off with a car .
490697	33913	53796	10.0	A Wonderful film with almost Greek tragedy sentiment	The Entertainer is one of those great films that makes you stop and think about the has been entertainers like Archie after their heyday . I could see the relationship between Joan Plowright and Laurence Olivier evolve from the screen into a love affair . Joan is quite brilliant playing his daughter and Larry is well one of Britain's greatest treasures from the theater . I also enjoyed Dame Thora Hird's role as the mother of a contest winner . The story is rather complicated but it is richly interpreteted onto the film . We feel sorry and love Archie despite his obvious flaws and faults . We support him in the end and know why he did it ? After all the show must go on . Morecambe , Lancashire is also Dame Thora's birthplace and hometown . It's great to see legends like Dame Thora Hird , Dame Joan Plowright and Lord Laurence Olivier .
490334	33913	92890	10.0	Dirty Dancing Coming to Broadway for it's 20th anniversary !	There was talk on the E ! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies . Maybe the music , the dancing , or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle . Of course , this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off . Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally . Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit . It has the love story , the music , and most of all lots of dancing . Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily . it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother . It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations . At the end of the film , it is sad to see the hotel owner , Kellerman , be baffled by the next generation . It happened anyway ! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills . Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos . Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well . After all , they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever , this should be a no brainer ! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times . There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1 , 000 times by now . Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old . Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times . I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb , Johnny Castle . Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music , two soundtracks , and even a tour in the late eighties . I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical . It would work for the audience to be part of a film . No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again . Well , Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing . It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary .
489926	33913	185906	10.0	Television Classic !	The Band of Brothers is not just any ordinary World War II mini-series . It is a masterpiece of sorts . It's hard to focus in on such a broad topic like World War II but they manage focus on a group of American soldiers . I watched the liberation of the concentration camp scene which was touching and devastating . Their discussion of what they knew when or where was frank and realistic . Did they know about Auschwitz or Treblinka ? Maybe not there at the moment , the horror of the war was revealed by American liberators at that concentration camp scene . Of course , the Nazis had several kinds of camps as well . They go on to Hitler's winter chalet in the mountains where there was plenty of wealth to feed the country itself . The American soldiers ponder about life after the war and the casualties . War has never been easy now or during World War II or ever . Lives are lost and those who survive must come terms to deal with their life afterwords . I have to say that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg has done a wonderful job in producing this film which would have won a hand-load of Oscars .
490137	33913	103569	10.0	Always Striving for Perfection !	Jay Leno may not have had the natural presence of Johnny Carson but he does have something else that matters . Leno is completely devoted to his show so much that he has declined hosting the Oscars . He is often the first person to come in the mornings and the last to leave at night . Leno doesn't take vacations because he prefers to work doing his stand-up . I often joke that he's the Judi Dench of stand-up comics because he could have comfortable life with just the Tonight Show salary but he still works about 150 shows a year on the club circuit . The show is always a thrill to watch for his humorous monologues and occasional sketches he does . No , he's not Johnny Carson who barely handled three shows a week and often used replacement hosts like Jay Leno and Joan Rivers . Thank God , Leno doesn't do that . He gets us caught up on episodes we may have missed and he's not gone too long . Leno strives for perfection with humor and it's never-ending !
