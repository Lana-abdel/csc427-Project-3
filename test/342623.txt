494029	342623	113627	1.0	beyond bad	A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . Incredibly bad . Very pretentious . It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute . We don't really learn anything about this character , except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic . We don't know why . Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual , but I feel that this role and this script let him down . And how , after not being able to perform for the whole film , can he have an erection on his deathbed ? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath .
494010	342623	319507	4.0	Inaccurate , boring , done on the cheap documentary	" Hollywood Sex Symbols " is a thrown together mess featuring some - certainly not all - of Hollywood sex symbols from the 1920s through the 1970s - in about 42 minutes . The footage is of poor quality and of little interest . In the beginning , as the commentator talks about Hollywood glamor and the beautiful people , there is a clip of three men standing outside of the Oscars - all unrecognizable , and one of them looks like Dwight D . Eisenhower . The commentator then announces the name of the program as " Hollywood'S Sex Symbols " while the chiron says " Hollywood Sex Symbols . " Right away you know you're in trouble . Most stars get between 30 seconds and 1 minute , with the majority of time spent on Sophia Loren and Marilyn Monroe , although there is one long , dull segment of Bridget Bardot posing for photographers . There are no clips from movies . Everything shown is from press conferences or premiers , or events where the press was present , and the film quality is uniformly bad . The rest of the material is photographs . Jayne Mansfield is included ; Jean Harlow is not . Rita Hayworth is included ; Ava Gardner is not . Clark Gable is included ( along with some interesting news - he won an Oscar for Gone With the Wind ) ; Gary Cooper is not . The commentator talks about Rita Cansino and how different she looked before becoming Rita Hayworth , but we only get to see photos of Rita Hayworth in her prime . The cast list on the IMDb page lists Charlie Chaplin - must have missed him , but doesn't list Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn , both of whom were included . Since the program was done in 1988 , Rock Hudson is omitted . Very poor and easily skipped .
494650	342623	52325	5.0	Unusual casting in a strange comedy	1958 was before Ross Hunter embarked Doris Day on the fabulous career she had in the ' 60s , in which she would become a top box office draw - in fact , THE box office drawer for years . In " The Tunnel of Love , " she plays a sweet , vivacious woman who is desperate to have a baby and can't , so she and her husband , played by Richard Widmark , plan to adopt one . When the adopted baby bears a strong resemblance to Widmark , he becomes sure that the child is the result of an evening he can't remember with the investigative social worker ( Gia Scala ) . Based on a play , this kind of light , subtly sexual comedy became very popular on the dinner theater circuit in the ' 60s and ' 70s , joining the ranks of " Mary , Mary " , " The Marriage Go Round , " " Boeing Boeing , " etc . It is not particularly well directed by Gene Kelly and sports the very strange casting of Richard Widmark as Day's confused husband . I can't agree with the comments here . Though an actor known for playing tough roles and cruel men , he does a credible job here mainly because he knows enough not to play for laughs . He creates a full character , that of a caring if foolish man who adores his wife but screws up occasionally . Gig Young plays the philandering husband next door . He's fine , but the character is very unlikable . There's not really much to recommend here . I suppose at the time it was considered somewhat suggestive , but it doesn't play well today .
493502	342623	409182	5.0	Tragic use of big bucks to make a big ripoff	98 minutes of fake-looking special effects and sheer dreck comprise " Poseidon , " a 2006 movie hoping for people trying to get in out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theater . It was commented by an observant viewer on the board for " San Francisco " that Hollywood has lost the art of the buildup , the point being that the big earthquake in " San Francisco " didn't occur until the last portion of the film . The film spent its time building up the characters and situations , all heading toward that fateful day . Ditto " In Old Chicago . " Nowadays , when writers attempt to build a story , it's usually written in too slow a fashion . A great example of a film where this WASN'T the case was " Match Point , " written by the brilliant Woody Allen - but you'll have to really look to find another film like that . Producers won't even consider a script that doesn't get to the point in the first 10 minutes . In " Poseidon , " Hollywood has reached a new low - and who knew it could sink any lower ? We have stock characters given one or two lines to explain their characters . I'm not sure why any of them bothered . There was absolutely no way to care about them . Why not just start with the ship sinking ? This was a movie about special effects , nothing more . Why pretend otherwise . Some of the special effects were quite exciting on the big screen , so I gave it a 5 . I can't comment on the performances . There weren't any . P . S . I was told - and I don't know if this is true - that if a ship the size of the Poseidon sinks , and you're anywhere near it on a lifeboat , the undertow drags you down with it . Not that anyone was going for accuracy here .
494798	342623	74209	5.0	pretty sad	Though an interesting premise , Bittersweet Love is kind of a mess . Lana Turner was a very beautiful woman , and certainly in her younger years had an undeniable charm and lightness , as in " Strictly Dangerous . " By 1976 , that girl is gone . Lana's name is used strictly as a gimmick to get people to watch - she doesn't do much except overact and wear that babushka she often wore with a fur coat . I can't remember if she wore sunglasses , but she usually did in that getup . The story is intriguing if the stuff that soaps are made of . Without realizing it , a half-brother and sister fall in love , get married , and the woman ( Meredith Baxter-Birney ) becomes pregnant . It turns out that Birney was the product of a fling that Turner had with Scott Hylands ' father . Once this is revealed , some tough choices need to be made . Incest is very repulsive to females , so sayeth one of the pundits in the story ; Hylands , however , wants to have the baby and continue the relationship . Celeste Holm and Robert Lansing are also in the cast , playing husband and wife . Bad mismatch . And , alas , not the only thing bad about " Bittersweet Love . "
495066	342623	56908	5.0	Kind of lame	Robert Stack , Joan Crawford , Susan Oliver , Herbert Marshall , Constance Ford , Van Williams and Diane McBain are " The Caretakers , " a 1963 film also starring Polly Bergen , Janis Paige , Barbara Barrie , Ellen Corby and Sharon Hugueny who are the cared for . Robert Vaughn plays Bergen's husband . The setting is a mental institution where Polly Bergen is brought after she goes insane at a theater showing West Side Story . She wasn't the first . The focus is on her case as the director of nurses ( Crawford ) and the doctor in charge of an experimental program ( Stack ) duke it out - naturally Crawford favors things like discipline and confinement ( she would ) and Stack wants to treat the patients as people and give them therapy . I don't know where the drugs were , unless they didn't have them in 1963 . I'm pretty sure they had Librium , though Polly didn't seem to be on it . This film has TV written all over it , including in its choice of the actors , most of whom did major work on television . It's not strong enough for a feature film , though it looks for all intents and purposes like a B movie which it perhaps was . Robert Stack is pretty one-note . Crawford in 1963 still looked good in a leotard but the rest of her is plenty scary . I'm not sure the portrayal of the conflict was correct in its dynamics - nurses have a certain amount of power but riding roughshod over a doctor's orders . . . I suppose with Crawford heading up the staff , it's more than possible but not realistic . Janis Paige gives a lively performance as a man-hater , and there is the ubiquitous non-speaker ( Barrie ) , the nice one ( Corby ) , the delusional one ( Hugueny ) , and the one who will probably recover ( Bergen ) . Herbert Marshall plays the head of the institute - by 1963 , he was 73 and had enjoyed 50 years on stage and in films . After a distinguished career , " The Caretakers " is thankfully not his last credit . Constance Ford played a nurse from hell who is not a credit to her profession . There were two hunks with the last name of Williams back in the day - Van and Grant - this one's Van . Nice eye candy but he didn't have much to do . All in all , pretty badly directed and executed .

Kay is Elsie , the wife of a wealthy British businessman . The two share a huge , beautiful home in England . A business trip calls the husband , Robert , away to India for nearly a year , and wives are not allowed . So she will be less isolated , Elsie heads for Paris . There she becomes glamorous , sophisticated and worldly . She meets a rich , handsome Spainiard , Arturo ( Cortez ) who escorts her around and wants a lot more . He finagles a way to get her alone in his mansion ; tragedy occurs . This is an old-fashioned melodrama ; few people could suffer like Kay Francis , even early on . Everything about her was so distinctive - her look , her voice , her clothes - it's hard to take your eyes off of her . Cortez is smooth and caddish as her pursuer ; Paul Cavanagh as Elsie's husband is difficult to read . He never lets you know how he's going to react until the situation is upon him - then he might surprise you . Mildly entertaining , of interest for the early Francis .
493569	342623	22430	5.0	Early Warners talkie starring Walter Huston	When a family witnesses a murder , and some of them can identify the killer , their lives become terrifying in " Star Witness , " a 1931 Warner Brothers film starring the great Walter Huston , Sally Blane , Dickie Hugent and Chic Sale . It will be hard for a 21st century audience to believe this movie was nominated for an Oscar for original story , since we've seen it dozens of times since . Also , with a film like this , it's hard to envision it the way a 1931 audience did . Unfortunately for " Star Witness , " it's just not one of those movies that has stood the test of time . Nevertheless , this 76-year-old film is interesting in that it tells us a lot about America , families , movie-making , and writing in the early ' 30s . Huston plays the DA in charge of the case . This role bears no resemblance to Dodsworth , but the way the part is written is worth noting . Even in books in the 1930s , including the original Perry Mason books , characters were given to big , declamatory speeches , as Huston's character is in this film . Apparently this was part of the writing style in fashion - and that style dates any movie faster than the sight of an old car in one of the scenes . The family unit consists of two little boys , plus an adult , working daughter who still lives at home , and an adult son ( Frank Nugent ) who is , for all intents and purposes , a bum . Of interest - the beautiful , marriage-age daughter ( Sally Blane , Loretta Young's sister ) doesn't have her own place . It wasn't done back then - what would that say about her ; also , she needed to contribute to the family income . And the gap in the children's ages ? Not unusual . As in my own family , women back then often had many pregnancies and either miscarried or the babies died . Chic Sale , all of 57 at the time of filming , plays what has to be the world's oldest man , Grandpa , a very annoying character who talks about his love of America , standing up to foreigners and not letting them take over the country . Sounds kind of familiar , doesn't it ? Seventy-six years later , there are still people saying that . A big shootout scene toward the end of the film was reminiscent of many other film shootouts in the early days - people shot guns without taking any particular aim . The effect they went for back then seems to be just making as much smoke as possible . Shooters keep the guns close to their waists and just shoot like blind men . So despite what seems like a routine crime drama with some over the top characters and bratty kids , " Star Witness " still has a few things to offer , if only to show us that while lots has changed , a few things haven't , and that what was original in 1931 seems like it's by the numbers in 2007 . To paraphrase Addison DeWitt : " Watch it . The minutes will fly like hours . "
494194	342623	60801	5.0	A true , true camp classic , right up there with Valley of the Dolls	Stephen Boyd is a ruthless actor vying for " The Oscar " in this 1966 film also starring Tony Bennett , Elke Sommer , Eleanor Parker , Milton Berle , Jill St . John , Ernest Borgnine , Edie Adams and a cast of thousands . This is the kind of film one watches with friends and just howls at . Here's the complete tipoff that this movie is going to be awful : Tony Bennett , who has the map of Italy on his face , plays a character named Hymie Kelly . Now I ask you - the fact that he's even acting in a film is scary enough - no singing required - but this name on top of it , and you know it's over before it begins . The story is about a man , Frankie Fane , who rises from the ranks of introducing a strip show to becoming a big star in Hollywood . On his way to the top , he uses and abuses everyone he meets . And they take it . And they love taking it . The film begins at the Oscar ceremonies . He's been nominated , and his friend , Hymie Kelly , reminisces about Frankie's rise to the top in a voice-over . " You finally made it , Frankie ! Oscar night ! And here you sit , on top of a glass mountain called " success . " You're one of the chosen five , and the whole town's holding its breath to see who won it . It's been quite a climb , hasn't it , Frankie ? Down at the bottom , scuffling for dimes in those smokers , all the way to the top . Magic Hollywood ! Ever think about it ? I do , friend Frankie , I do . . . " Fade to a strip joint . Now , the most recent review of " The Oscar " on IMDb said it best when he or she referenced Tyrone Power and wrote : " He could be a full blooded hero or he was a hero / heel , a likable sort of guy , but one who was ruthless in getting what he wanted . You need someone of Power's ability and charm to play such a part . " I'm not sure it was Stephen Boyd's fault that he was hateful . I sort of blame the script . I have to blame something . Why anyone would have hung around this guy for 5 minutes is beyond me . No charm . Bad manners . Terrible to women . Violent . Stephen Boyd badly overacts , or is it just that the actors around him the most went to an acting school advertised on the back of a matchbook . Jill St . John was more horrific than I could ever have imagined . Beautiful , sexy , but I've heard better line readings from high schoolers . The woman the studio has Frankie escort around town so that he can be seen - when he dumps her Green Goddess salad in her lap , it was a high point . Then there's Tony Bennett's Hymie , a weasel who follows Frankie around like a lap dog and takes orders from him . The big reveal at the end is one of the funniest scenes on record . How Elke Sommer kept a straight face is beyond me . Well , she looked thunderstruck - certainly an appropriate emotion . Milton Berle plays Frankie's agent , Kappy Kapstetter , who takes Frankie on at the request of the delusional Sophie Cantaro ( Eleanor Parker - where are they getting these character names ) . I loved how each sex scene ended with a woman lying on her stomach wrapped in a sheet and sobbing as Frankie walked out the door . The good actors are all wasted , but kudos to the lovely Elke Sommer for quietly holding her own . The ones who did this movie like Merle Oberon and Bob Hope probably did it as a favor to someone - they cheapened themselves . I am sure that the Oscar scene in " In and Out " parodied that scene of Oberon reading those ridiculous movie titles for the nominated actors . Too good to pass up . Naturally with Joseph E . Levine as producer , the production values are top-notch and the gowns are beautiful . Unfortunately there aren't enough big parties so that one can look at the gowns . I can't blame Hollywood for not inviting Frankie Fane to many events .
493952	342623	386676	5.0	I have a feeling the British version is better . . . much better	I probably should give this show more of a chance , but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it , I probably won't watch it again . Most of the time , British comedies , when taken over by Americans , don't seem to make it . " Fawlty Towers , " which lasted all of five minutes , comes to mind . This appears to be one of them . There were some very funny moments , and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version . The boss , plain and simple , is a complete moron . Totally out of it , he thinks he's a role model and hilariously funny , when all the while he's a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks , does Three Stooges impressions , and is emotionally abusive ( firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears ) . It's a great setup for a fabulous character , but I found him only annoying . I'm afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp's : embarrassed , appalled , and not finding much funny .
494477	342623	50439	5.0	Interesting for the cast	" The Girl in the Black Stockings " is a B movie , and I don't give it the tremendous historical significance one of the other reviewers did . It's obviously made cheaply , and the story is awkward . Directed by Howard Koch , it has a surprising lack of pace . The stars are Lex Barker , Anne Bancroft , John Dehner , Ron Randell , Marie Windsor and Mamie Van Doren . The plot concerns murders at a resort - in fact , the film begins with the discovery of a dead body , and several more follow . Dehner plays the sheriff . The resort is owned by a man with hysterical paralysis ( Randell ) and his sister ( Windsor ) , who takes care of him . There's a Barrymore-type actor preparing for a comeback with the help of a va-va-va-voom blonde ( Van Doren ) , and several guests , including Barker and Bancroft , who apparently have some sort of history together . The acting is okay with the exception of a very young Bancroft , who smartly underplays what could have been an extremely over the top character . Barker was very handsome and fit , but after reading that Lana Turner threw him out when she learned he was abusing her daughter Cheryl , it's hard to watch him . Most of the characters really aren't fleshed out enough to give the actors something to work with . Stuart Whitman has a small part , as does Dan Blocker , who plays a bartender . Not great .
494252	342623	21885	6.0	If it doesn't fit , you must acquit	Norma Shearer is " A Free Soul " in this 1931 film also starring Lionel Barrymore , Clark Gable , Leslie Howard , and James Gleason . Though this is an early talkie , the actors handle the dialogue well , and there are not the awkward rhythms , pauses , or echoes one often hears during these first years . Shearer plays Jan Ashe , the daughter of an alcoholic attorney , Stephen Ashe . Ashe successfully defends a mobster named Ace Wilfong against murder charges by showing that the hat bearing his initials , found next to the body , doesn't fit him . Shades of O . J . Wonder if Johnny Cochran saw this film . The minute Jan meets Ace , there is an instant attraction , although she's engaged to Dwight ( Howard ) . Soon she is sleeping with Ace . Her father finds this unacceptable . Desperate to get him to stop drinking , Jan agrees to stop seeing Ace if he will lay off the booze . They leave the city with Stephen's friend ( Gleason ) and rough it for three months . Just before they're due to return to the city , Jan catches Stephen drunk . He disappears on a passing train , and she returns to Ace . This time , however , she realizes he's a cruel brute and no longer wants him . It is then that the film takes an unexpected turn . The themes in " A Free Soul " are dated today , having to do with the class system and a woman being a tramp if she sleeps with someone outside of marriage . Norma Shearer gives a very good performance as the flapper Jan , conveying a daughter's devotion and a determination to remain independent and not follow the norm . Not a great beauty , Shearer was a hard-working actress who had glamor , sophistication , and was ultra-feminine . The latter is especially evident in newsreels where she's only playing Norma Shearer . Lionel Barrymore is not yet in a wheelchair due to arthritis here . He does a great job as a man who is a shadow of what he was but still retains elements of greatness . It's certainly interesting to see Rhett and Ashley with a woman between them 8 years before " Gone With the Wind . " This was one of Gable's breakthrough performances . Unmustached and looking very young , his persona is fitting into place - when he slaps Jan , he packs a wallop , and he kisses a woman like he means it . Leslie Howard is an elegant , gentle , and romantic Dwight . I happen to like his Ashley - his idealism , impracticality and mixed signals are what make him attractive to Scarlett . Here , he's as honorable as Ashley , with his protection of Jan being the only thing that matters to him . " A Free Soul " is a turgid melodrama , and some of the acting may seem a little over the top today , but it's still recommended for the performances and especially for the young Gable , who would be packing a wallop and kissing like he meant for another 30 years .
494801	342623	35151	6.0	Uneasy mix of comedy and drama	" Once Upon a Honeymoon " is a 1942 film directed by Leo McCarey with a script by Sheridan Gibney and McCarey . Despite its stars , Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers and McCarey as director , the uneven script ultimately topples this film . Part of the problem is that as an audience member , you're not sure what to do - is it serious or funny ? In a way , the audience is set up for comedy - they see it's a McCarey film with Rogers and Grant - and then they don't really get it when parts of it aren't funny . When it's Europe in World War II and you're mistaken for Jews , it's no joke . Nevertheless , this is a film with some very good scenes , particularly at the beginning when Rogers feigns a fake British / upper class accent and then takes a call from her mother ; she then sounds like a fishwife as she announces her marriage to one Baron von Luber ( Walter Slezak ) . Grant plays an American war correspondent investigating the Baron , who is suspected of being a top - but secret - ally of Hitler's . It does seem that wherever he goes , that country falls soon after . When Grant takes Rogers to lunch , he tells her vodka is Polish water - she takes hers with some brandy . She eventually escapes from von Luber but is forced to re-connect with him to get information . " Once Upon a Honeymoon " has its moments , including its serious ones , but it seems like two films , neither belonging with the other . A real McCarey comedy with Grant and Rogers tripping up the Nazis would have been great ; and of course , both actors could have pulled over a serious war film as well . In trying to make them do both , the movie's statement is confused .
494004	342623	26187	6.0	Paul Lukas as Philo	Philo Vance has been played by a number of actors over the years , everyone from Wilfred Hyde-White to William Powell , who portrayed the detective the most . In " The Casino Murder Case , " it's Paul Lukas ' turn to have a go at it . This is a light mystery concerning some murders within a family . Rosalind Russell is the young woman here , and she does a fine job . I'm not familiar with Philo Vance in the books so I can't comment on Lukas ' portrayal in comparison . However , I suspect that normally , the role is approached with a lighter touch . Lukas is a wonderful and very likable actor , but I think that in the hands of someone like William Powell , the humor would have been mined a little bit more . Lukas isn't heavy-handed in any way , it's just that this type of role isn't a perfect fit for him . All in all , entertaining .
494898	342623	35034	6.0	A woman comes between two best friends	" Manpower " is a 1941 Warner Brothers film directed by Raoul Walsh . Walsh said that Jack Warner used to call him to his office and say , " You have to direct this film for me . " Walsh would ask , " Who's in it ? " " Oh , I don't know , " Warner would moan . One wonders if " Manpower " was one of those films , though it would be pretty hard to forget that you had a film with Marlene Dietrich scheduled . The story is that of a typical love triangle . Hank ( Robinson ) and Johnny ( Raft ) are linemen ; Hank falls hard for Dietrich , who works at a clip joint . He proposes and though she tells him up front that she doesn't love him , she accepts . Then she finds herself in love with Johnny . Dietrich is stunningly beautiful though I was distracted by a wig that seemed to overpower her face . And when was the last time you heard her described , as Raft does , as " just a dame ? " Hardly . She is very good as Fay , who , while she gives it a go with Hank , wants her chance at real happiness . Robinson , who could play pathetic like nobody's business , gives us a pretty pathetic Hank here - injured so that instead of working on the power lines , he's now a manager , unlucky in love and dumpy looking . For a guy who could play mean as dirt , he portrayed these blustery , insecure men very well . Raft is a very dapper Johnny , a nice contrast to Robinson . With the exception of an exciting ending , there really isn't anything exceptional about " Manpower " except the cast and the fact that it rains a lot . Definitely worth seeing for the unique casting .

Brent plays Joe Medford , a newspaper reporter in hot competition with Rosemary Durant ( Blondell ) to get the best stories . When star Mona Harrison ( Jergens ) discovers the body of a studio costume designer in a box of material , she calls Medford instead of the cops and begs for help . She and the designer didn't get along , and it looks as if she's being set up to take the fall . This is fairly routine stuff brightened by the always delightful and energetic Blondell , whose character follows Medford everywhere , often getting caught . Brent conveys a light comic touch rarely seen in his leading man days of the ' 30s . By 1947 , at the age of 48 , Brent was moving into character parts and television . Ditto 41-year-old Blondell . I suppose B movies were a good way to have them use up their contractual obligations . Jergens is appropriately glamorous . We actually learn more of the background story toward the end of the film rather than at the beginning , so the plot has a little twist that otherwise might not have been there . Otherwise , it's a lot of running , chasing , and hiding , but Blondell's many fans will enjoy it .
494028	342623	53017	6.0	Loneliness and the power of forgiveness	Montgomery Clift is a writer hired to be " Miss Lonelyhearts " for a newspaper in " Lonelyhearts , " a 1958 film also starring Robert Ryan , Myrna Loy , Delores Hart , and Maureen Stapleton in her film debut . About 30 years ago - yes , 30 - I saw the play " Miss Lonelyhearts " with none other than Kelsey Grammar , who had not yet gone to Hollywood . The play , as well as the book , are quite different from what ended up on the screen . In the film , the ending was changed to a more upbeat one . This is a great film if you're contemplating suicide because this will take you right over the edge . It is relentlessly depressing with some pathetic characters and some unlikeable ones . Adam ( Clift ) is a man with a hidden past that he keeps even from his girlfriend ( Delores Hart ) . All the viewer really knows at first is that he was raised in an orphanage and has a father in prison . The paper on which Adam works is owned by William Shrike , an abusive , cynical man ( Ryan ) who is horrible not only to his employees but to his wife ( Myrna Loy ) because of her infidelity 10 years before . This is a man who carries a grudge . When he meets Adam , he thinks his sincerity is fake and becomes determined to wear him down . His first step is to hire him as Miss Lonelyhearts . Adam becomes very bothered by the problems his readers send to him , especially because he can't help anyone . When Shrike dares him to meet one of the letter-writers , he does so . It's Maureen Stapleton , a needy woman with a crippled husband who can't make love to her . The performances in this film are very good , but the film isn't . Clift apparently was very disappointed in it because it lacked none of the bite of the novel and none of the symbolism of Adam as a Christlike figure bearing the sins of others . Robert Ryan is very convincing as the hateful Shrike , and Myrna Loy is beautiful and sad as his wife . Stapleton received an Oscar nomination for her effective performance . An accomplished stage actress , Stapleton evokes the desperation of this lonely woman . Montgomery Clift by this time was almost at a point where he was dependent upon the kindness of strangers . He was too much of a risk for Hollywood to be interested . Like so many people who are victims of horrible accidents , he had become addicted to painkillers and alcohol . If not for Elizabeth Taylor making a case for him , he would not have been cast in " Suddenly , Last Summer . " As it was , Mankiewicz almost stopped shooting on the film . He is fragile and glassy-eyed here , in obvious pain , and his voice slurs . The fragility works well in this role as does the sensitivity he brings to the part . He still had a beautiful smile , which unfortunately he doesn't get to use much here . It's always wonderful to see Montgomery Clift perform , even toward the end of his career . That interesting voice of his , the intelligence and sensitivity of his work , and the tenderness with which he approached a love scene were unmatched . His film career was relatively short , but he left a powerful legacy . " Lonelyhearts " is not a great film , but it stars Montgomery Clift , so it's worth seeing .
494165	342623	104498	6.0	why so hard on this movie ?	I was surprised at the strong negative comments toward this film in the " comments " section . It certainly doesn't deserve the skewering . When I first saw this movie , I thought it should have been a feature film . I was interested to read in one of the comments that that's exactly what it was , in a much darker version . " In the Eyes of a Stranger " has some excellent elements , including the plot . The problem , of course , is just as one of the posters wrote , it was watered down for television and cast as such . The main character should be compelling , complicated and seductive . Justine Bateman has none of these adjectives in her repertoire . But remembering that despite its potential , it is a TV movie after all , it comes off very well . I don't agree that the Bateman character would have been less calm in the first hour after the subway incident - look at her history , also look at what information she received . I think one of the problems with the previous posts is that people got this film at their local video store instead of seeing it on Lifetime . As a video rental I don't think I'd have been too thrilled either . But why did you rent a movie starring Justine Bateman ?

In " As Good as Dead , " Bernard plays Susan Warfield , who works in an office . She takes a hep , sick young woman , Nicole ( Traci Lords ) to the hospital and gives the desk her own insurance card so that Nicole can be treated . Otherwise , they would have to go to the county hospital . Susan tells her office she has to have surgery ( as Nicole does ) and then takes off on vacation so as not to run into anyone she knows . When she returns , Nicole , assumed to be Susan , is unexpectedly dead ; Susan's apartment has been cleared out , and her job is gone . The strangest part of it is that a half-brother that Susan isn't aware she has made all the arrangements . Susan has no choice but to move into Nicole's apartment and wear Nicole's trendy , too short clothes until she can find out why Nicole died and who this mysterious half-brother is . This is actually quite an interesting film , very Lifetime , very TV movie , but entertaining with good performances . Bernard is likable , Lords is Lords , and Judge Reinhold does very well as an attractive man who becomes part of Nicole's ( Susan's ) life . Mr . Cohen's daughter is undoubtedly married now with children of her own . Though this film was made in 1995 , he is still very active as a writer . Thanks to the computer , I'm still typing .
494478	342623	818120	6.0	Better than some	Let's face it : " Mystery Woman " " McBride " and " Jane Doe " are about as bad as you can get . They have no pacing and most of the time suffer from poor direction and bad scripts . What these series have going for them are attractive leads , sometimes okay mysteries , and if you have an elderly relative at home who is affronted by just about everything else on television , the Hallmark Channel is perfect for them . " Mystery Woman " stars Kellie Martin as the owner of a mystery bookstore with no customers . We know it's a mystery store because there's an establishing shot of it every two minutes . Obviously , these shows run short - there are lots of scenes where we see a car from way off driving down the street , into a driveway . . . endless . In this episode , Sam winds up taking care of a fugitive's wife and baby though at first , she thinks the woman is just a family friend . The woman's husband is sought in a murder that took place on a golf course - he was seen bending over the body . There are people after him and they're not all police . At one point , he's shot and his wife leaves Sam with the baby and goes to his motel to take care of him . Sam's investigation uncovers an FBI case and blackmail . It's hard not to like Kellie Martin as both an actress and an individual . I love her , and she's good as Samantha . She doesn't have a lot to work with , yet she always manages to give a charming performance . As her best friend and the DA , Nina Siemaszko does well with an impossible role . Clarence Williams III , as the mysterious Philby , is certainly mysterious - it's a mystery how he was cast . Dead man barely talking . Okay if there's nothing else on television .
494781	342623	40444	6.0	A crook replaces a lookalike doctor	Paul Henried plays a double role in " Hollow Triumph , " a 1948 film also starring Joan Bennett . Henried is John Muller who , the minute he gets out of prison , hatches a robbery plot of a casino with his old gang . None of them want to go along with it , but Muller bullies them into it . It doesn't go as planned . The owner of the casino , Stansyck , is known for hunting people down who wrong him even if it takes years , so Muller is now a marked man . When he's stopped on the street by a dentist who believes him to be Dr . Victor Bartok , Muller begins to hatch an idea . They look exactly alike - except for a scar on Bartok's left cheek . " Hollow Triumph " or " The Scar " as it's also called is a very entertaining movie even with a preposterous plot . One small point is the casting of Eduard Franz as Muller's brother . Were they separated at birth , with Muller brought up in Germany and his brother raised in the U . S . ? Or did someone cast Eduard Franz thinking that because of his name , he had an accent ? Paul Henried does a good job in his dual role , though we really don't see a lot of Bartok's personality . Joan Bennett is good as an embittered woman who believes she's unlucky in love . Seeing " Hollow Triumph " in 2008 , one thing sticks out : a guy filled his gas tank for a dollar .
493677	342623	36092	6.0	On the other side of Brokeback Mountain	Jean Arthur meets cowboy John Wayne in the 1943 comedy , " A Lady Takes a Chance . " Arthur is Molly , a woman with plenty of suitors , though none is a prize , who takes a cross-country bus tour - conducted by Phil Silvers . While watching a rodeo , one of the riders falls on top of her . Turns out it's a fella named Duke ( John Wayne ) . You can just see those pathetic guys at home flash before her eyes as she pulls Wayne toward her for a closer look . She misses her bus . Given the current talk and late-night comic jokes about " Brokeback Mountain , " this movie is extra fun . Wayne has no intention of marrying , though he loves to play the field , and accuses his rodeo partner Waco ( Charles Winninger ) of acting like " a wife . " When Waco advises Molly to go back where she came from and forget about Duke , he sounds like a wife trying to get rid of a mistress , though he really wants to keep her from being hurt . But though Duke does a lot of flirting , Molly learns during a night in the desert that her big competition is Sammy , Duke's horse . Jean Arthur is slightly miscast as Molly , though she was too wonderful an actress to ever come off as totally miscast . Someone like Betty Grable would have been more of a natural for the role than 40 + Arthur , but then , Arthur's talent helps her make the part her own and interesting besides . Her best scene is in the bar when she drinks cactus milk - hilarious . 27 years after his death , John Wayne is still considered one of the top 10 most popular stars , and with good reason . Tall , handsome , and rugged with a boyish smile , you can see why he'd make Arthur's heart go aflutter . He's usually not listed among favorite matinée idols because he made so many westerns , but make no mistake , Wayne was a hunk in his heyday . This isn't your 21st century cowboy movie , but it makes for entertaining viewing just the same .
493978	342623	29345	6.0	Trite story and some good singing	" On the Avenue " was made in 1937 and starred Madeline Carroll , Dick Powell , Alice Faye and the Ritz Brothers . A musical revue does a send-up of a wealthy family , which outrages them . The writer , Gary Blake , accuses the young woman of the family , Mimi Caraway ( Carroll ) of being a bad sport . She invites him to dinner , and they fall in love . He promises to rewrite the skit . However , Mona Merrick ( Faye ) , the leading lady who is in love with Gary , performs the skit so that the family comes off as even worse . Mimi retaliates by buying the production and planning some big revenge on Gary . There are some good numbers and wonderful singing by Faye and Powell ; alas , the appeal of the Ritz Brothers has always been lost on me . They always do these incredibly long routines in films , and to me , anyway , they're annoying rather than funny . Madeline Carroll is stunningly beautiful ; it's a shame she wasn't in Hollywood longer ( in 1938 , she was the highest paid actress in Hollywood ) . She returned to England to work for the war effort and stayed on after the war . Dick Powell , in the course of a 30-year career , reinvented himself several times . Here he is in his first incarnation , that of a juvenile tenor . He's very good and as he evolved into a serious actor and then a director and producer , he only got better . Alice Faye looks great and sings in her beautiful , smooth contralto ; her stardom was just about to hit its peak . All in all , very pleasant . If you're like me , record this and fast forward through the Ritz Brothers .
494993	342623	48291	6.0	Bogie as a missionary in China	Humphrey Bogart experiences " The Left Hand of God " in this 1955 film also starring Gene Tierney , Lee J . Cobb , Agnes Moorhead and Lee J . Cobb . Bogart is Father O'Shea , who arrives at a mission in China to take over religious duties . The casting of Bogart should tell you something right away . While there , he wins the hearts of the people and that of a beautiful nurse ( Tierney ) who is a widow and , being a strong Catholic , finds her emotions unsettling . Father O has a relationship with a Chinese warlord , and now the village seems in danger . Can he save it ? There's not a tremendous amount of action in this film , but the wonderful cast keeps us interested . Always a surprising actor , Bogart has a way with touching moments , such as receiving a blessing from the oldest man in the village . In 1955 , Gene Tierney was still a young and beautiful woman , but for some reason , around 1950 , she adopted a short , matronly haircut that I for one never found flattering . She's lovely in this as a lonely widow . Moorhead and Marshall give strong performances as the doctor and his wife . Lee J . Cobb is good , but seen today , his Chinese makeup is distracting . Mildly interesting .
494895	342623	56089	6.0	I feel like one	Beautiful scenery is the highlight of " I Thank a Fool , " which stars Susan Hayward , Peter Finch and Diane Cilento . Finch plays a prosecutor who manages to get Hayward sentenced to prison for the mercy killing of her boyfriend . When she gets out , she has to change her name , but still , she can't get a job . Finch reappears and hires her to live in his home and take care of his unstable wife ( Cilento ) . When she winds up dead , suspicion falls on Hayward . This is a very uneven film that ends somewhat abruptly . It could have used a couple of scenes right before the last one . One of the posters here said the ending was no surprise . Well , it was to me . Maybe I just wasn't paying attention . The acting is good , with Hayward in a role that calls for her to be quite somber . Peter Finch is excellent . He's very compelling and deliberately keeps his character ambiguous . Diane Cilento has the role with all the histrionics . She's exquisitely beautiful and delicate , and one does feel great sympathy for the character . All in all , this was a rather blah experience .
493665	342623	434185	6.0	McBride will grow on you	I've seen several episodes of " McBride " and I like it a little better each time I see it . John LaRoquette is very good in everything . As McBride , I love how much he can communicate with just a wry glance . In this particular episode , McBride's client is double-crossed during a custody case by his psychiatrist . The client later confesses to McBride that he believes he accidentally shot the doctor when he confronted him in his home . When McBride goes to the murder scene , the doctor is , as the title says , out - as in gone ! A search for the body begins , with time of the essence . David Bowe has a nice comic turn as the panicked client . Former child star Sydney Penny plays one of the suspects , and she has grown up to be a very beautiful young woman . Soap star John Ingle is the confused head of the hospital . These Hallmark mystery movies are nice shows - decent mysteries , good acting , some familiar faces . As far as LaRoquette , I quote Blanche Dubois : " That one seems superior to the others . "
493922	342623	487264	6.0	Typical	" Mystery Woman : At First Sight " is another entry into the Hallmark series . Kudos to director Kellie Martin on this one - there wasn't an establishing shot of the bookstore every 30 seconds . In this episode , Samantha Kinsey finds her birth mother Hannah ( Kathryn Harrold ) - just as the woman is about to be arrested for murder . A man is dead in her living room . Without revealing to her half-sister ( Christine Lakin ) or Hannah's husband ( John Aprea ) who she is , Sam sets out to help clear Hannah of the murder charges . Meanwhile , back home , Philby ( Clarence Williams III ) is having his own problems . The comments on this site were interesting in that some people expressed disappointment in this episode . I'm not sure why - it was just as slow-moving and pedestrian as the rest of them . It was a kick to see Michael Cole and Clarence Williams III , two of the " Mod Squad " members reunited , but despite Philby telling Cole he looked good , he didn't . And that's the reason I watch " Mystery Woman " when I see it's on - sometimes it features some baby boomer stars , and I also like Kellie Martin . This series , like Jane Doe and McMartin , is okay , but that's about it .
494133	342623	32556	6.0	When life mocks you , mock it back	Some classic age actors , when seen today , appear hammy and using old-fashioned technique . And some are timeless . John Barrymore is timeless and , in one of his last films , " The Great Profile , " he lampoons himself mercilessly - in the role of a ham with old-fashioned technique . The story is based on what really happened to the actor during a play called " My Own Children . " The actor Evans Garrick ( Barrymore ) has been missing for three days . When he arrives home drunk , he's in costume and he's reciting Shakespeare , believing that he just left a film set an hour earlier . Infuriated , his wife Sylvia ( Mary Beth Hughes ) leaves him . Then pretty Mary Maxwell ( 17-year-old Anne Baxter ) arrives with a play she is desperate for Garrick to do . He gets rid of her by saying he will meet her in his agent's office the next day . His agent ( Gregory Ratoff ) owes some mobsters $8200 and when he hears that Ms . Maxwell has a wealthy fiancée , Richard Lansing ( John Payne ) who will back the play , he's all for it . It's a complete disaster , but it gets Sylvia back from Reno as soon as she hears about it , and she wins back her role . Totally polluted by the second act , Garrick makes the play a hit by ad-libbing and finally rolling off of the stage in a wheelchair . Ms . Maxwell is finally convinced to take what she considered her serious drama into New York , where it's been booked for a six-month run , but she takes Garrick in hand to sober him up . Everyone's unhappy - her fiancée and Garrick's agent in particular , since the play is deathly if Garrick isn't drunk . Strangely enough , most of this actually happened to Barrymore in real life , including his wife leaving him and returning to get her part back in New York . And she did hide in Barrymore's wardrobe as Garrick's wife does in the film , though in real life , Barrymore's daughter Diana tried to keep her from doing so . Barrymore is extremely dissipated in " The Great Profile " and reads his lines off of cue cards , which toward the end , he did often . For people who say he's a ham , I say he was playing one . He does Hamlet with a quivering sing-song voice . Does anyone believe this is actually how he played his famous Hamlet ? He was Olivier's inspiration for the role . Olivier first played Hamlet in 1937 and was known for speaking the dialogue instead of singing it . There are some very funny moments in " The Great Profile " but in the end , it's a bizarre movie , enlivened by Barrymore's presence . If you want to see a non-hammy Barrymore , I suggest " The Great Man Votes " or " Bill of Divorcement . " He was a great actor with a big personality - if that seems strange by today's standards , well , it's the pictures that got small .
494150	342623	23891	6.0	Early Hepburn	Katharine Hepburn is a beautiful and accomplished aviatrix in " Christopher Strong , " a 1933 film also starring Clive Owen and Billie Burke , and directed by Dorothy Arzner . Hepburn's role of Lady Cynthia is loosely based on Amelia Earhart , a young , ambitious career woman who is not interested in marriage and home but rather accomplishment . She's an early feminist , and the role is perfect for Hepburn , who with her androgynous looks and strong performances would go on to play many such roles in her very long career . " Christopher Strong " is of interest because it's early Hepburn , has a feminist theme in the early ' 30s , and also because it's pre-Code . Arzner does a great job depicting the love affair of Hepburn and Owen and yet shows nothing , with a hand reaching up and checking the time on a small clock . . . then the light is turned off and plunges the room into darkness after the lovers exchange a few words . The problem with the movie is that it's badly dated , a ' 30s melodrama with tremulous , " we must be honorable , " pip-pip and all that rot dialogue . Owen tells everyone at a party that he will never be unfaithful to his wife , that it is a moral charge he holds high - and seconds later he meets Hepburn and you can tell he's already falling . Owen is an odd choice of a romantic partner - he's not exactly the man one would give up everything for . A bigger problem is the performance of Billie Burke , a fine actress . She is extremely sympathetic as the suffering wife - so sympathetic , in fact , and Hepburn seems so callous about the whole thing for most of the film , that one sides with what I'm sure is the wrong person . Also , putting up with your husband's infidelity and not saying anything brings us right back into aggressive non-feminism . I am forced to agree with one of the other comments - yes , it is directed by an important director , yes , it stars an important , legendary star , yes , it's early feminism , and yes , it's not that great a movie , rather , an artifact . Worth seeing ? To catch Hepburn in that moth costume - absolutely .
494497	342623	36881	6.0	Trite and light musical comedy	" Greenwich Village " is a musical from Twentieth Century Fox starring Don Ameche , Vivian Blaine , Carmen Miranda , and William Bendix . The film seems a bit slapped together , especially in light of the fact that one of the numbers was actually footage from " Springtime in the Rockies " that was cut . There's not much of a story - it concerns a young composer , Kenneth Harvey ( Ameche ) who meets Blaine and Bendix in a speakeasy . Bendix jazzes up Kenneth's concerto , intending to use it for a show , while Kenneth hopes to have it performed in a classical genre . He also falls in love with Blaine , whom Bendix considers his girl . Miranda is a multipurpose performer at the Danny's Den , and has some cute numbers - " Give Me a Band and a Bandana , " " I Like to be Loved By You , " and " I'm Just Wild About Harry , " all energetically performed in some wild costumes . Vivian Blaine looks absolutely beautiful and sings well . Ameche gives a pleasant performance as someone experiencing New York and the Village for the first time . A great deal is made here of Greenwich Village as a haven for artists , and the sets are very much like the neighborhood as it must have been in those days - crowded and brightly lit . The street that Danny's Den was on looks like West 8th Street , and it was fun to see . " The Revuers " who included Judy Holliday , John Frank , Betty Comden and Adolph Green , alas , were cut from the film , and the best number was " It Goes to Your Toes " performed by " untitled black musicians " who were fantastic . They were possibly The Layson Brothers . The DeMarcos turned in some sprightly dancing . This isn't one of Fox's blockbusters , but it has the tell-tale vibrant Fox colors , likable cast , and good musical numbers normally associated with musicals from that studio .
493917	342623	24025	6.0	Debut of a great screen pair	If you watch " Flying Down to Rio " expecting it to be a Rogers and Astaire film , forget it - but it was their debut as a team , dancing the Carioca . This is a 1933 movie short on plot and , as is often the case with the early talkies , a little slow in parts due to the pace of the dialogue . It is nevertheless a fun movie , with Astaire doing some wonderful solo dancing and of course , his dance with Ginger , which sent them on their way to movie history . The stars of the film are Dolores Del Rio and Gene Raymond . After bandleader Raymond meets del Rio in the U . S . , he ends up in Rio where he competes for her attentions with her fiancé Julio ( Raul Roulien ) , his best friend . The plot concerns the opening of a hotel in Rio and its planned takeover by another group . When the opening date is changed , the owner cannot get another performing license , so all seems to be lost . Thus the number " Flying Down to Rio " with chorus girls doing maneuvers on the wings of flying planes . It's a spectacular part of the film , though in spots you can really seek how fake it was . It doesn't really matter - it was early film-making where , without the use of computers , artistry and imagination were needed instead , and much was accomplished . There are some interesting editing experiments noticeable as well , particularly during a big nightclub scene . It was precode , so some of the numbers are pretty darn steamy . Dolores del Rio was surely one of the most stunningly beautiful women ever to appear on screen . Growing up , I remember seeing Sunday supplements with articles and photos about her current life - it was a good 30 years after this film - and her beauty remained awesome without the plastic surgery techniques available today . She was a true , fantastic beauty , and this film really showcases it . This isn't the most wonderful musical you'll ever see but it's important nonetheless : It launched Rogers & Astairs , it's an interesting example of early editing , and it's precode . And if you watch it with the wonder that the depression audiences must have had , you'll enjoy it even more .
495199	342623	35317	7.0	Sherlock Holmes in World War II	For the sake of propaganda during World War II , Sherlock Holmes was moved into the then-present . One of the results is " Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon , " starring a top Holmes , Basil Rathbone , along with Nigel Bruce , Lionel Atwill , Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne . It is Holmes ' assignment to deliver a scientist , Dr . Franz Tobel ( William Post Jr . ) and his weapon design to the British government before the Germans can get him . Once the man reaches England , however , his troubles are just beginning . Can Holmes decode the message Dr . Tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity , save the weapon and possibly the scientist too ? This is an effective Holmes story , set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England . The series worked just fine in the present day . It was not without its problems , but those problems had nothing to do with the time period . Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot ? Nigel Bruce's characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note . I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there , he's attractive , intelligent and a believable companion for Holmes . In the Rathbone series , Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson like the bumbling fool that he is . However , in this particular film , Watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts . I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation from Richard II - " . . . this blessed plot , this earth , this England " - I can't imagine how much it meant to the Brits watching the film in 1942 . Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose .
493726	342623	39110	7.0	An author meets her fictional hero in person - so she thinks	Claudette Colbert chases a soldier " Without Reservations " in this 1946 film which also stars John Wayne , Don DeFore , and Ann Triola , with cameos by Louella Parsons , Cary Grant , Jack Benny , and Delores Moran as themselves . Colbert plays a best-selling author , Christopher Madden , who has written a book about the world post-war - it looks to be a combination of " Gone with the Wind " and " Atlas Shrugged . " En route by train to Hollywood to do the screenplay , she is extremely distressed to learn that Cary Grant will not be available to do the movie version and is writing a telegram to the producer when she comes face to face with her fictional hero in the flesh . He's a soldier named Rusty ( Wayne ) going to San Diego with his pal , Dink ( DeFore ) . She doesn't tell them her identity , giving her name as Kit Klatch . Kit decides she has to have Rusty star in the film so instead of boarding the train that will take her to L . A . , she gets on the train going to San Diego . This leads to all sorts of adventures for the threesome , and it's obvious that Kit and Rusty , despite very opposing political views , have fallen in love . Colbert is delightful as usual , and DeFore , kind of a Jack Carson type , is always pleasant to watch . The surprise for some will be John Wayne who's not riding a horse or wearing a cowboy hat . Frankly , this writer has always preferred him that way . I'm not a particular fan of westerns , and the plainclothes Wayne seems handsomer and less stiff somehow . He's playing the role of someone whose beliefs are close to his own in real life , i . e . , somewhere to the left of Genghis Khan , while the Colbert character is a socialist . Tall and handsome , he does the romantic scenes well ; one wishes he'd stayed out of the saddle more often . This is a light , fun comedy that takes place in a world that , like Kit , doesn't quite know which direction to take post-World War II . Sixty-one years later , we still haven't figured it out , and " Without Reservations " remains an entertaining film .
493766	342623	43782	7.0	A small drama with big names	Joseph Cotten , Barbara Stanwyck , Louis Calhern , and Leslie Caron star in " The Man with a Cloak , " a 1951 thriller set in 1848 New York . A young woman ( Caron ) comes to New York to get money for her boyfriend's political cause from his grandfather ( Calhern ) . Grandpa is in the clutches of his ex-girlfriend turned housekeeper ( Stanwyck ) and a surly butler ( Joe De Santis ) who are waiting for the old man to die so they can get his money . The Caron character thinks they are trying to kill him , so she appeals to an apparent ne'er do well who hangs at the local bar , Dupin ( Cotten ) for help . This is a slow-moving story for sure , but Cotten has some great dialogue nonetheless . Stanwyck looks beautiful and is very good as the duplicitous woman . Alas , these are film careers on the wane , as evidenced by the smallness of the film . Caron is quite young and appealing , and of course , her star would go up and up . The ending has a twist that is quite fun . I have no idea if it's historically preposterous or not , but this movie needed a kick and it was a good one . Certainly worth seeing for its stars .
494262	342623	21778	7.0	Lots of fun and precode , too	" Dance , Fools , Dance " is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931 . Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan , a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties , booze , and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming . This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother ( William Blakewell ) penniless . Bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name Mary Smith ; her brother goes to work for bootleggers . The head man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays yet another crook . Later , of course , he would turn into a romantic hero , but in the early ' 30s , MGM used him as a bad guy . Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity , Bonnie cozies up to Luva . Gable and Crawford made a great team . Her facial expressions are a little on the wild side , but that , along with her dancing , is one of the things that makes the movie fun . Look for Cliff Edwards , the voice of Jiminy Cricket , as Bert . It's always interesting to see the precode movies , and " Dance , Fools , Dance " is no exception .
494564	342623	39337	7.0	Two tragic stars in a delightful fantasy	There were many beautiful women during Hollywood's golden years , but only a small percentage would qualify as goddesses . Rita Hayworth was definitely one of that elite group , possibly never more stunningly beautiful as she appeared in " Down To Earth . " As Terpsichore , goddess of music and dance , she comes to earth to star - - and correct - - a Broadway show about Terpsichore . Several characters from " Here Comes Mr . Jordan " appear , with Roland Culver taking the Claude Rains ' role of Mr . Jordan . Larry Parks plays the producer-director-star , Danny Miller , who has to pay off a gambling debt with this show or die . Though the music isn't that memorable , the story is charming , and the film contains a lovely performance and great dancing by Hayworth ( whose voice is dubbed by Anita Ellis ) , and she's given excellent support by James Gleason , Culver , and Edward Everett Horton . Larry Parks , fresh from his star-making role in " The Jolson Story " does a good job but one wonders , had he not been blacklisted , what would have happened to his career . He wasn't a particularly strong leading man . But we'll never know , because a few years later , he was finished . As for Hayworth , it's a shame that someone so incredibly beautiful and vivacious , who brought so much happiness through her work , could have had such a miserable life - abuse by her father , a string of bad marriages , and finally Alzheimer's . It was her Alzheimer's that helped to bring the disease to national attention . Princess Yasmin Khan , Hayworth's daughter , has become an internationally known spokeswoman and active fund-raiser to increase awareness and finance research to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease . Besides her glorious presence , Rita had one more gift for the world .
495117	342623	91572	7.0	a lesser TV adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel	Having read all of the Agatha Christie books , I have to say that David Suchet was the ultimate Hercule Poirot as written by Agatha Christie . But my favorite Poirot , having nothing whatsoever to do with either Poirot or what Ms . Christie wrote , is Peter Ustinov . It always reminds me of what someone once said about Zero Mostel in " Fiddler on the Roof " - " He's fabulous . . . but what he does has nothing to do with Fiddler . " Ustinov is a sheer delight in every way - he's funny , he's charming , he's warm , he's relaxed - all things that , frankly , Agatha's Hercule just wasn't . " Murder in Three Acts " is a slapped together TV movie without the usual star power except for Tony Curtis and several TV actors - the gorgeous Emma Samms , who was a big TV star in the ' 80s , Diana Muldaur , Concetta Tomei , Dana Elcar , Nicholas Pryor , and several others . The characters have been Americanized , and though set in Acapulco , aside from a few exterior shots , you don't get much atmosphere . Though the story is very interesting ( it is , after all , based on an Agatha Christie novel ) , the production has a certain blandness to it . You know there's a problem when Diana Muldaur announces that she and the Tony Curtis character did " Private Lives " together . Now , I happen to be very fond of Tony Curtis - I did research for his autobiography , he's on the cover of a book I wrote , I found him a very charming man - but come on , PRIVATE LIVES ? With that New York accent ? I don't think so . He does , however , look really fabulous , and if you watch the scenes in his house carefully , you'll catch some fantastic photos of him on the wall . It's an okay way to pass the time , and the plot is intriguing , Tony's Tony , Emma's beautiful and sexy , Nicholas Pryor is funny , and Ustinov is - well , he's Poirot even if he's not what Dame Agatha had in mind .
494276	342623	420671	7.0	Lovely remembrance of a lovely lady	Hosted by Kathleen Turner , " Myrna Loy : So Nice to Come Home To " is a good , if not terribly informative , documentary about Loy , the qualities she brought to film , and her evolution from exotic , mysterious female roles to light comedy . There is a heavy amount of focus on her film partnership with William Powell and the 14 movies they made together , including , of course , " The Thin Man " series . There is some biographical information provided and photos of the very young Loy , but the documentary clearly is concerned with her work as an actress . There are no interviews with friends , coworkers , or family , and nothing from the lady herself . Lots of film clips are scattered throughout , with emphasis on the " Nice to Come Home To " - showing various scenes of this , including Frederic March's return from the war in " The Best Years of Our Lives , " and coverage of the wonderful work Myrna Loy did for The Red Cross during World War II . She was as lovely inside as she was out , it seems . Very enjoyable .
495081	342623	34890	7.0	Bad Bette ! Bad , bad Bette !	Holy Toledo - Bette Davis has played some really bad women in her life , but the part of Stanley tops it ! Davis , Olivia de Havilland , Dennis Morgan , Charles Coburn , and George Brent star in " In This Our Life , " an odd film from 1942 . Davis and de Havilland play Stanley and Roy ( guess dad wanted boys ) . Stanley is dating Craig ( Brent ) and Roy is married to Peter , a doctor ( Morgan ) . The film no sooner begins than Stanley and Peter run away together . It doesn't take long before Stanley becomes dissatisfied with Peter's lack of money as a young surgeon and his hospital hours . After Peter's suicide ( I wonder ) , the good Roy comes and brings her sister back home . Meanwhile , Roy has started to see Craig . Stanley hates being home and prevails upon her lecherous uncle ( Coburn ) to give her money so she can go away . Meanwhile , I swear she's trying to kill him by plying him with booze . It goes from there , with Stanley becoming more and more horrid with each passing frame of film . Her best line is " YOU'RE AN OLD MAN ! WHO CARES IF YOU DIE ? I'M YOUNG . I'VE GOT MY WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF ME . " Totally outrageous . One comment asks if it's Davis or the script that wrecks this film . I blame the script . You have the too good sister , so good she's saintly - I mean , her sister stole her husband and she doesn't slap her silly - and then you have the bad sister , so bad she's absurd . Then there's the treatment of black people which is offensive - though that is acknowledged in the film . Plus , Sidney's relationship with Uncle William will give rise to a lot of speculation . At one point , Olivia de Havilland looks at a portrait of an ugly relation and says , " I'm not as pretty as she is . " Well , if that were going to be the case , someone should have done a better job on the painting . De Havilland is absolutely beautiful and gives a very good , sober , well-grounded performance - in juxtaposition to Davis batting her eyes , pouting , and sashaying . Huston obviously didn't know how to handle her . Davis was capable of brilliant performances but she had to be in sync with her director . She wasn't . Morgan and Brent are the mild types of leading men Warners usually cast opposite strong women . Morgan is very handsome and believable as the put-upon Peter - and if he did kill himself , you can't really blame him . Brent does a good job as the attorney who turns his attentions to Roy . As the young black man whose future is threatened by darling Stanley , Ernest Anderson gives a wonderful performance , giving his character the appropriate likability , intelligence , and lack of aggression . Always an excellent emotional actress , Hattie McDaniel scores as his mother . This thing is one big potboiler , complete with an overwhelming score by Max Steinberg that is really a bit much . So is the movie . And guess what , I still recommend it . Even an overdone Bette is better than no Bette at all .
495183	342623	30202	7.0	Johann Strauss II in words and music	Jules Duvivier directed this opulent , highly fictionalized musical film about Johann Strauss II . " The Great Waltz " stars Luise Rainer , Fernand Gravet and Miliza Korjus . Strauss II married several times , but none of his wives were named Poldi Vogelhuber , but she is most likely modeled on Strauss ' third and last wife . The Carla Donner character , with whom Strauss falls in love , did not exist . Strauss did form an orchestra , however , consisting of friends at the tavern , and did play at Dommayer's Casino . He also was involved in the revolution on the side of the revolutionaries . None of these biographical facts are the point of this movie - it's about the beautiful music , the singing , and the romance . There it succeeds , and the film was an enormous success , especially in the European markets . Luise Rainer gives a lovely performance as Poldi , who faces losing her beloved husband to another woman , and Gravet is an effective Strauss . Thalberg gave the European coloratura Korjus , who plays operatic diva Carla Donner , a contract on the basis of one of her recordings . We can assume it wasn't a recording of her singing Die Fledermaus . Korjus was a good bet for Hollywood - she was beautiful , glamorous , a good actress and a good singer , with a few caveats . She had a lovely quality to her voice , glorious pianissimos , and her technique was adequate , but her coloratura high notes were straight and screechy . Her singing of Die Fledermaus toward the end of the film is massively off-pitch - it's surprising the recording was not re-done . The best scene in the film is Strauss and Donner going through the Vienna Woods and Strauss coming up with the Tale of the Vienna Woods while listening to the birds and hearing the different rhythms as they travel . A very fun scene . An incredibly expensive film with beautiful music , costumes and dancing .
494264	342623	48791	7.0	Sir Walter Raleigh and The Virgin Queen	Bette Davis is again " The Virgin Queen " in this 1955 film , and this time , her attention is on Sir Walter Raleigh . Earlier , in a more interesting film , " The Story of Elizabeth and Essex , " she was the younger Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex was Errol Flynn . " The Virgin Queen " is sumptuous in its production , done in color , and the costumes deservedly won an Oscar . Here Elizabeth is older and becomes fascinated with Walter Raleigh ( Richard Todd ) when he comes to her court to request three ships to sail to the new world in search of treasure on behalf of England . She puts him in charge of the palace guard ; he in turn falls for a lady-in-waiting , Lady Elizabeth Throckmorton ( Joan Collins ) and secretly marries her . The queen grants him one ship , but while he's preparing it , he finds out that Elizabeth Throckmorton is pregnant with his child . Unfortunately , Elizabeth finds out too and has him placed under arrest . This is a mildly interesting film and historically not very accurate , though it is true that he married Beth Throckmorton secretly , she became pregnant , and he was arrested . The real story is simplified in the film . It makes for not very exciting viewing , though the acting is strong and the cast excellent - besides the stars mentioned , Herbert Marshall is Lord Leicester and Dan O'Herlihy is Lord Derry . Bette Davis does a marvelous job as Elizabeth , a tough , feisty , demanding and sometimes angry woman . Nobody could look as bad as Davis when she felt it was necessary for the role - she allowed four inches to be shaved from her hairline ( Elizabeth had lost her hair due to fever ) and wears what can only be called a fright wig . Hollywood stars back then would dress down , muss their hair , maybe cut back on the makeup , but Bette set the bar quite high for acting generations to come when it came to distorting her appearance . She is very effective in the role - as someone pointed out , she's a Yankee playing a British queen , and you never doubt that she is one . Richard Todd handles the language beautifully , but while he may have more depth than someone like Flynn , he doesn't exhibit the necessary charisma and charm . Joan Collins is young , beautiful , and does a good job as Elizabeth Throckmorton . Worth seeing for the elegance of production and for that fabulous force of nature , Bette Davis .
494076	342623	40155	7.0	Post-war Tourneur	Robert Ryan , Merle Oberon , Robert Coote Paul Lukas and Charles Korvin are on the " Berlin Express , " a 1948 Jacques Tourneur film about a multinational group headed for a conference in postwar Germany . In the film , Ryan is an agricultural expert from America , Robert Coote is a schoolteacher from England , Merle Oberon is a French national accompanying an important German , played by Paul Lukas . He has a plan to unify Germany once again . His protectors have anticipated some danger on the train , and when he appears to be murdered , the murdered man is actually someone impersonating him . As soon as the enemy finds this out , however , Lukas is kidnapped . The group on the train bands together to find him and also to clear themselves . This is a good film , historically significant , as it was the first Hollywood production made in post-war Germany and also because it shows the devastation in Germany as a result of all of the bombings . There are some suspenseful moments and a message for unity - Tourneur does a good job with the elements , though it doesn't compare with " The Third Man . "
494928	342623	25272	7.0	fascinating film about the international banking family	Darryl F . Zanuck covered Napoleon's sweep across Europe in two early films : " Lloyds of London , " in which Tyrone Power plays a fictional character who continues insuring the British fleet so that his childhood friend , Horatio Nelson , can win the war ; and " The House of Rothschild " in which Nathan Rothschild and his banker brothers provide the financing to beat Napoleon . Both are excellent films . There are a few historical liberties in " The House of Rothschild , " but the film is based on fact . George Arliss has a dual role as Mayer Rothschild and his son , Nathan . When the film begins , the family is living in a Prussian Jewish ghetto where Mayer is doing well but doesn't want the tax collectors to know . On his deathbed , he instructs his sons to establish banking houses throughout Europe as so much money is stolen when it is being carried by messengers . The plot then focuses on Nathan and goes into the rampant anti-Semitism which forces Nathan out of an important loan . It also shows his brilliance for business as he fights Count Ledrantz ( Boris Karloff ) who spreads propaganda and incites pogroms . The climax of the film takes place when it appears Napoleon is winning and Nathan starts buying up everything on the stock market , which is bottoming out , in order to keep the deal he made for the war effort . Though not much is made of it , the Rothschilds had informants everywhere , which enabled them to get information before anyone else . He is able to announce before it is made public that Napoleon has been defeated at Waterloo . " House of Rothschild " stars one of the great actors , George Arliss . Other actors from the stage entering films often used tremulous voices and melodramatic gestures but Arliss had a tremendous speaking voice and a grand acting style that made a powerful impression on the screen and infused the characters he played with a believability as well . A blond , beautiful Loretta Young is on hand as his daughter , who is in love with a Gentile named Fitzroy ( Robert Young ) - and though one would expect the love story to be fiction , it isn't . This film has an interesting history of its own : Excerpts from it , taken out of context , were used in the anti-semitic Nazi films Der ewige Jude and Die Rothschilds . Despite persecution , the Rothschilds remain an extremely powerful family in the present - the original name of the family was Bauer ; Rothschild is actually German for " red shield , " which is in the center of the family coat of arms . Today , they're in a variety of occupations besides banking - actress Helena Bonham Carter is a Rothschild due to a marriage on her mother's side .
493501	342623	408345	7.0	Entertaining , derivative , but they're trying	I give " Firewall " a lot of credit for attempting to make an exciting film about computer fraud . It can't be easy to do something concerning the digital age and computers , with its sedentary activity and focus on monitors , and yet given our lifestyles and the technology age , it has to be addressed in films set in the present . " Firewall " tries and , though the story is old , it partially succeeds . It's the story of a family held hostage - nothing new there - because the crooks need something from dad . Nothing new there either . The family as usual is fairly idyllic - a pretty wife , successful dad , a sweet boy , a teenaged brat daughter going on 40 . The crooks are typical too - there's the ruthless , evil one , the one who's more sympathetic , and the idiot . However , there are some tense moments to be had in " Firewall " and it is in its way good old-fashioned entertainment as security specialist Harrison Ford attempts to outsmart the villains who want him to transfer huge amounts of a bank's money into a special account . The good cast helps : 24's perfect everywoman , Mary Lynn Rajskub , is on hand as Ford's assistant , the excellent Paul Bettany is the nasty kidnapper , and the cast is rounded out by Robert Patrick and Alan Arkin . Two comeback kids are in the cast as well : Robert Forster as Harry and Virginia Madsen as Ford's wife . Imagine - she's 45 , so for a change , the wife was not 20-something or 30-something . Although Forster is completely wasted in his role ( as is Arkin ) , it's great to see him in A pictures again . Thanks , Quentin Tarantino , for rediscovering this fine actor . I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford's . To me , he's a adventure hero right out of the ' 40s and a classic movie star . But at 63 ( at the time of filming ) he's too old for this kind of thing and looks it . It's time he stepped into roles such as Robert Redford's in " The Clearing . " We get rid of the female stars as romantic leads a lot sooner . Somehow , Hollywood lets actors like Ford , Connery , Eastwood , etc . do these action films until they're ready to drop . Ford has a screen presence that is good in a variety of roles . No reason he can't retire this particular genre . All in all , this is a very good rental .
494940	342623	25101	7.0	fluffy fun	" Fashions of 1934 " is an amusing light comedy starring William Powell and Bette Davis . Davis looks much more sophisticated than she did in " The Man Who Played God . " She's very glamorous and also very good in a film that's mainly fueled by Powell's performance as a con man . The Powell character goes from con to con , sometimes a con within a con - he can't resist . One of his schemes is to copy fashion sketches from Paris and pass them off as originals . Another is to sell a surplus of ostrich plumes by featuring them in a musical revue . This gives rise to a great musical number , " Spin a Little Web of Dreams . " It's a Busby Berkeley kaleidoscope production . The audience at the musical revue , however , didn't see it as moviegoers did - from above . This is a fun movie and notable for the actual fashions shown , a good performance by Powell , a spectacular number and early Davis before she established her screen persona .
494902	342623	67451	7.0	Rosalind Russell takes on Emily Pollifax	In her final theatrical film ( there would be a TV movie in 1972 ) , Rosalind Russell plays novelist Dorothy Gilman's Mrs . Pollifax in " Mrs . Pollifax , Spy . " This 1971 film also stars Darren McGavin , Nehemiah Piersoff , Albert Paulson , Harold Gould , John Beck and Dana Elcar . The script is written by Russell under a pseudonym . Mrs . Pollifax is an elderly woman who after being widowed volunteers to be a spy for the CIA . Since she looks so un-spylike , one of the people at the CIA ( Elcar ) decides to try her out on a mission . She is to go to Mexico , head for a bookstore , watch for The Tale of Two Cities in the window , enter the bookstore when she sees the book has been placed in the window , exchange some code sentences with the owner , get the book and leave . Except it doesn't go that way . Before Mrs . Pollifax knows what hit her , she's en route to an Albanian fortress with a man , John Sebastian Farrell ( McGavin ) . They share a cell . Mrs . Pollifax goes to work plotting their escape as Farrell recovers from a bullet wound . The Mrs . Pollifax books make for light , fun reading , and this pleasant story is along the same benign lines . Some of the elements of the books are disregarded - for instance , Mrs . Pollifax's children never were told she was a spy as they are here . Rosalind Russell does an excellent job , and she looks wonderful , particularly when one remembers how blown up the poor woman was from steroids due to her rheumatoid arthritis later on . She was such a striking woman with a strong presence in the films she made over her career . Darren McGavin isn't Gilman's Farrell , but his dry humor is effective just the same - another actor who , like Russell , is sorely missed . This movie doesn't move very quickly ; in fact , it's slow in parts , but there are some good scenes , particularly the Christmas party that Mrs . Pollifax talks her jailers into throwing . You can really admire her charm and cleverness . " Mrs . Pollifax , Spy " is one of those comfortable movies where one sees a lot of familiar faces and an okay story . You'll see worse , you'll see better - but seeing Russell and McGavin more than makes up for the script's shortcomings .
493636	342623	86762	7.0	big , lush miniseries	This is another of those big , lush ' 80s miniseries , better known as trash wallows . What fun they were - expensive , scenic , opulent . Mistral's Daughter is based on a novel by Judith Kranz , concerning three generations of women in the same family involved with a great artist , portrayed by Stacy Keach . Stefanie Powers plays Maggy , the matriarch of the family , who , as a young woman , meets Mistral and becomes involved with him . Later on , her daughter meets him , falls in love with him and bears him a child . Mistral is a real jerk , a Nazi collaborator who turns escaping Jews away at his gates and even turns in a few to get paint supplies . The kind of total narcissist codependents fall in love with . When his illegitimate daughter finds out about this years later , Mistral has to come to grips with his own selfish , self-absorbed life . For a good actor , Stacy Keach isn't very good in this - everyone suffers from rotten accents . Stefanie Powers is always good but playing a 17-year-old when she was over 40 may not have been the best move , although she certainly is very beautiful . All in all , this is a very entertaining miniseries . Just don't take it too seriously and enjoy it for what it is - an ' 80s artifact .
495005	342623	40669	7.0	Robert Walker meets a heavenly goddess	During and after World War II , fantasy was big in Hollywood . It wasn't just escapism ; it was all the thinking about death as many loved ones were lost . It's no wonder we had so many people coming back ( " Here Comes Mr . Jordan " ) , facing the pearly gates or the hotter ones ( " Heaven Can Wait " ) , or meeting angels in human form ( " The Bishop's Wife " ) . We also had a visits from the big goddesses . How fitting that two women closest to being goddesses in human form actually played them - Rita Hayworth as Terpsichore in 1947's " Down to Earth , " and of course , Ava Gardner as Venus in " One Touch of Venus . " " One Touch of Venus " is based on the Broadway musical of the same name that was revived in London a few years ago with Melissa Errico , but never came to New York . Alas , there aren't many songs in this version but the most famous song , " Speak Low When You Speak Love " remains . The film stars Gardner , Robert Walker , Dick Haymes , Olga San Juan , Tom Conway , and Eve Arden . Walker works in a department store where a magnificent statue of Venus is about to be unveiled . On an impulse , he kisses it , and she comes to life . He falls madly in love with her , while his girlfriend ( San Juan ) flips out for his friend ( Haymes ) . When the statue is discovered missing , the police assume that Walker knows something about it , since he was fixing the presentation curtain and claims that she then came to life . Walker is an energetic delight as he chases Venus . After this film , he was institutionalized , and by 1951 , his boyishness was gone as he entered what should have been the greatest part of his career with a magnificent performance in " Strangers on a Train . " Instead , he only made one more film after that , dying in 1951 . Looking at him in " One Touch of Venus , " it's hard to imagine he had any demons . Eve Arden is hilarious as the secretary in unrequited love with her boss , Tom Conway . He's seen Venus sleeping in the home department and fallen for her as well . Haymes sings beautifully , and San Juan is pert and pretty as a young woman suddenly torn between two men . But all eyes are on Ava Gardner's dazzling beauty . She's a perfect embodiment of Venus with her flawless face , figure , and soft voice . Even though as a younger woman she had tried singing with a band , she wasn't a singer , so her voice is dubbed in this by Eileen Wilson . Like Hayworth , early in her career , she sometimes played roles that required vocals , and like Hayworth , she was always dubbed . The best scene in the film takes place in the park toward the end . It's exuberant and thrilling - you won't want it to end . That scene sums up this lovely fantasy with a divine Ava , and you can't get any better than that .

It's five years since Rollie quit the film business ; now he's a toy-maker with a new girlfriend , Kim ( Ticotin ) . When Kim's ex-husband , Mike ( Tom Mason ) , a police officer , asks for Rollie's help in catching a killer , he reluctantly agrees . Through no fault of Rollie's , Mike ends up dead and Rollie has the proof that Mike was set up . This puts Rollie in danger - deja vu . He makes a desperate call to Leo , and the two team up again . This time around , the plot is a somewhat far-fetched , the emphasis being more on action . There are some very exciting scenes as well as some ingenious toys , including a toy clown that figures prominently in the plot . Brown and Dennehy have incredible chemistry . They're a joy to watch . My old classmate , Josie DeGuzman ( here spelled Josie ) is back as Leo's secret weapon in the department . Being predominantly a theater actress , her performance is somewhat stagy but she's no less likable . Joanna Gleason plays an assistant DA . Clever effects , the great re-teaming of Brown and Dennehy , and very entertaining .
494755	342623	21377	7.0	enjoyable and interesting early talkie	" Sin Takes a Holiday " stars Constance Bennett as a secretary in love with her boss - how's that for a novel plot line ? Well , perhaps in 1930 , it was , and there is more to it than that . It's an early talkie , so the timing is a little off as the actors get used to the technique . It's also pre-Code , so anything goes . And does . In this film , everybody cheats on their spouses . The boss , however , is unmarried , but his girlfriend wants to get married to him right away . So he marries Bennett and sends her abroad so he can have his cake and eat it too . While there , Bennett is escorted about by Basil Rathbone , in a delightful performance . He falls in love with her , but Bennett needs to find out if she can have a real marriage with her husband . Having read some of the comments , I'm unsure if people think that Bennett was amoral . The marriage for opportunity plot was used over and over - " Mannequin " is just one example - and Bennett marries her boss to do him a favor , not so much for the money . Plus , the title is " Sin Takes a Holiday " and it does seem that she avoids a dalliance with Rathbone while abroad . So while I find the crowd her boss runs with fast and loose , I did feel Bennett was a very likable character . Not to mention , a great beauty .
493678	342623	40553	7.0	Lovely fantasy	Tyrone Power is a man who encounters a leprechaun in " The Luck of the Irish , " also starring Anne Baxter , Jayne Meadows Cecil Kellaway , and Lee J . Cobb . Power plays Stephen Fitzgerald , a newspaperman who takes a job with an influential publisher turned politician , Augur ( Cobb ) - not because he believes in Augur , but because of the money and prestige . Egging him on is Augur's elegant , glamorous daughter ( Meadows ) who's in love with him . And who can blame her . It's outrageously handsome and charming Tyrone Power . While in Ireland , Fitz meets a young woman , Nora , to whom he's attracted , and a leprechaun with the proverbial pot o ' gold . Even though Fitz gets the gold , he returns it , and the leprechaun is in his debt . When Fitz returns to New York , the leprechaun appears as a servant , Horace , and strange things begin to happen . This is a charming film that effortlessly draws you into its whimsical story . Power did many comedies when he first signed with 20th Century Fox , and if you've seen them , you know he performed them beautifully . His reactions while a bartender is telling a leprechaun story are hilarious . It's a shame this versatile actor didn't put down his sword and do more comic roles . He'd pay homage once again to the land of his ancestors in " The Long Gray Line " for John Ford seven years later . How sad that when the really good parts were finally coming his way , he died . Anne Baxter is darling as Nora , and Meadows is appropriately brittle . The two are great opposites - Baxter natural and sweet , Meadows made up and bejeweled . Kellaway is excellent as Horace , the leprechaun turned houseman . " The Luck of the Irish " will leave you with a smile on your face . Uplifting stories are hard to find - see this one .

His next case is a real winner : an obnoxious British director ( Liam Neeson ) has a " dead pool " on the set of his new horror flick . Each crew member picks ten celebrities they believe will die , and the one with the most dead celebs on their list at the end of the game is the big winner . Just one problem with this - the people on the director's list start dying at an alarming rate and mysteriously , including his leading man . And guess whose name is on the list as well - yeah , Harry's . If this isn't enough , a TV reporter ( Patricia Clarkson ) wants to do a big story on him . Directed by Buddy van Horn , " The Dead Pool " is a spoof of a sort , killing a movie critic as part of the story ( ouch ) , and the story actually concerns movie-making . It also has a car chase that's a take-off on " Bullitt . " The stereotypical characters found in this type of film are played by some excellent actors , and there's plenty of sexual innuendo to go around . Someone mentioned that Eastwood seems a little old here for Dirty Harry . He seems old for just about every role he plays , frankly , but he keeps playing them . It's always amazing how men are able to do this with no problem , but give the man his due . He's a great presence , and in 1988 , his best work as both a director and an actor was yet to come ! Very entertaining and well-acted . If you can get the joke , you'll enjoy it all the more .
494077	342623	59410	7.0	An icon of the ' 60s	Made in 1965 , " The Loved One , " based on a novel by Evelyn Waugh , was highly publicized when it first came out . Brilliantly directed by Tony Richardson and with a magnificent and bizarre cast , it's the penultimate black comedy . It totally sums up the ' 60s youth movement of anti-tradition , anti-war , and anti-establishment . The basis of the story is that young Dennis Barlow ( Robert Morse ) comes over from England to visit his uncle ( John Gielgud ) , a Hollywood studio artist who , shortly after Barlow's arrival , is fired by a clueless studio head ( Roddy McDowell ) and promptly hangs himself . This leads Barlow to the Whispering Glades cemetery , where death is both an art form and a religion . Barlow becomes involved with a young cosmetician , Amy ( Anjanette Comer ) and meets some real characters , including the embalmer , Mr . Joyboy , who is saving up for a big tub for his big mother . This is a satire with lots underneath it and probably one of the most off-beat casts ever assembled , everyone from Liberace to James Coburn , and what was probably Dana Andrews ' final A-list role . Somewhere along the line , off-type casting went out of fashion , which is one reason why see are burdened with so much mediocrity today . A page from Richardson's book would liven up many a film . Dark , sometimes gross , sometimes hilarious , sometimes wild , " The Loved One " is not for everyone and its message probably won't be appreciated by the younger generation . Still , it's worth seeing .
494629	342623	28804	7.0	Crazy film done under sad circumstances	" Double Wedding " is an enjoyable , albeit dizzying comedy starring William Powell and Myrna Loy . It's really a tribute to the cast that they were able to carry on in such a wacky movie despite being shut down for a time due to Jean Harlow's untimely death . Both Powell , who was involved with Harlow , and Loy , who was a friend of hers , took her death very hard . Powell and Loy play polar opposites in this film . She is a complete control freak who has her life , her sister's life , and the life of her sister's fiancé , planned down to the millisecond . Along comes Powell , who lives in a trailer and hocks items when he needs money . Once he's in their lives , all bets are off , and chaos reigns supreme . The cast is great but the whole thing kind of veers off focus from time to time . The writing isn't as strong as in some of the other screwball comedies of the era . But Powell is a treasure and teamed with Loy , even more so .
494843	342623	51878	7.0	Long and hot all right , with a tremendous cast	Paul Newman stars with Joanne Woodward , Orson Welles , Lee Remick , Anthony Franciosca , Richard Anderson and Angela Lansbury in " The Long , Hot Summer , " based on stories by William Faulkner . It's a lushly produced film about a drifter , Ben Quick ( Newman ) , who comes to town . His reputation precedes him , and he soon upsets the status quo in the wealthy Varner family , headed by Orson Welles with a fake nose that kept melting off and an even faker southern accent . There's the weak , insecure son ( Franciosa ) married to a sex kitten ( Remick ) and an unmarried daughter ( Woodward ) saving herself for a momma's boy ( Anderson ) . In town , there's also Varner Sr . ' s mistress , played by Angela Lansbury . Ben sets his sights on Clara Varner and puts himself in direct competition with nervous son Jody for papa's approval . But Quick ultimately needs to reach underneath his swagger and bravura and confront his cut and run philosophy . This is a fantastic cast that delivers sparkling dialogue and an interesting story that has mostly well-drawn characters . The exception would probably be Remick , who has a small but showy role . She doesn't get to do much except show off her figure and sexiness . Welles is a riot - a marvelous technician , he knew how to externalize a character perfectly , and he is here the epitome of a Big Daddy type . His southern drawl is outrageous , and why he decided he needed a new nose ( which he had in other roles as well ) is beyond me . Woodward gives a touching performance as a young woman who has been living on hope and can't quite cope with her attraction to the overtly sexual Quick . Franciosa is excellent as a tortured young man unable to win his father's love . But as any film that stars Paul Newman , the movie belongs to him , one of the greatest actors to ever hit the screen . Macho , sexy and handsome , his Ben Quick is angry , determined , manipulative , and disturbing , with a hidden vulnerability . His scenes with Woodward sizzle , and you can see her character blossom under his attention . They're a great couple , both on and off the screen . Highly recommended , as is any film that stars Paul Newman .
494528	342623	33059	7.0	Nick Carter's last case	" Sky Murder " turned out to be Nick Carter's final case , which is a shame . The series had a lot going for it , including handsome , commanding Walter Pidgeon as Carter in one of his best roles . " Sky Murder " is a fast-moving mystery involving subversives - Nazis no doubt . Ten years later and it would have been Communists . After a murder in a locked airplane compartment , a German refugee ( Kaaren Verne ) becomes a suspect , and Nick is sure she didn't do it . It's never easy for Nick to work on a case because of people who won't leave him alone , and this time is no different . Donald Meek as Bartholemew is still around with his bees , and he has a hilarious fight scene . There's also a pseudo-detective , Christine Cross ( Joyce Compton ) who is a complete airhead . This series had a nice , chaotic and humorous feel to it , with the anchor ably provided by Pidgeon who puts up with Bartholemew and here , Compton , but never seems to get flustered . Really fun . It's a shame there were so few of the Nick Carter films .
494388	342623	41767	7.0	The King of Fox as the Prince of Foxes	Despite a comment that Darryl F . Zanuck refused Tyrone Power's pleas to make " Prince of Foxes " in color because he was angry with his star , this is not true . The film was probably made with Italian funds that the studio couldn't get out of the country , and there just wasn't enough money to do this richly-produced film in color . Zanuck was too much of a businessman to let anger ruin a good opportunity . And why would he have been angry ? Power was doing another swashbuckler like the big man ordered , wasn't he ? Despite not being in color , " Prince of Foxes " is a glorious-looking film , made on location in Italy . It's based on the Shellabarger novel about Andrea Orsini , a peasant with a fake royal name , who is sent by Cesare Borgia to infiltrate the court of Count Verrano , seduce his wife , and get rid of him so that Borgia's troops can take over his province . Orsini , however , double-crosses his boss . The acting is marvelous - Tyrone Power is wonderful as the turncoat Orsini , and manages to hold his own against the flashier roles of Cesare Borgia ( Orson Welles ) and Belli ( Everett Sloane ) . Though I doubt that Welles was terribly into his part , as usual he's excellent . When doing a role strictly for money , he had the habit of arching his eyebrow and intoning that glorious voice to make the audience believe he was doing something . It's only when one sees him as Citizen Kane or in a film like " Tomorrow is Forever " that one realizes these later supporting roles are phoned in . But who better to make the call than master technician Welles . Sloane does a fantastic job as a man who just can't stay loyal to one side and pulls one of the film's big surprises . The part is cut down from the book , which is a pity . The music , the scenery - amazing . The great halls are like nothing you've ever seen . For once , Tyrone Power has competition for beauty ! By the time of Prince of Foxes , he was totally sick of these roles , but he had a few years left before Zanuck turned him loose . It's said that he was too old to be a swashbuckler by 1949 - he was 35 , which today is nothing , though he often had to play parts that were intended for someone 10 or even 15 years younger . As a result , he sometimes looked tired out . But not here . Perhaps this film was more tolerable for him because of his impending marriage to Linda Christian , his second wife . In any event , he comes off very well . One thing I never understood is why Zanuck insisted on casting the post-war Power opposite these vapid starlets - Wanda Hendrix in this , Cecile Aubry in " The Black Rose , " Jean Peters in " Captain from Castile " etc . - of these , the only " find " was the wonderful Peters . Hendrix is okay in " Prince of Foxes " but that's about it . The role called for a little more depth than she was able to give . All in all , beautiful to watch , an intriguing story , excellent acting . Recommended , and , by the way , soon to be released in DVD as part of the Tyrone Power Collection .
494256	342623	340012	7.0	Delightful tale of a ' 30s stage star	Annette Bening has title role in " Being Julia , " a story about an actress who oftentimes doesn't know where she leaves off and her stage character begins . Though this is really a one-woman show , Bening is surrounded by a marvelous cast including Jeremy Irons as her impresario husband , Michael Gambon as her acting coach , who , though dead for 15 years , is coaching her through life , Shaun Evans as her young , ambitious beau , and Lucy Punch as her rival . Kudos to Bruce Greenwood , who plays a suitor of Julia's - it looked like Bruce Greenwood but didn't sound like Bruce Greenwood , so I had to look at the cast list . Julia Lambert is a 1930s stage star who , as far as she's concerned , will be playing women in her thirties for a long time . Though she depends on her husband , who owns a theater and guides her career , they lead separate lives ( he's under the impression that she hasn't been interested in sex since she gave birth to their son ) . She takes a young lover ( Evans ) who soon falls in love with blonde Avice ( Punch ) and asks Julia to let her audition for a role in her new play . Julia is most generous to her rival , encouraging her husband to cast her as the ingénue in the new play , giving Avice the stage in her key scene , and even wearing a colorless costume so as not to distract from Avice's moment . The viewer isn't fooled ; we sit there waiting for Julia's next move . Julia's own son Roger is never sure when she's acting or being real , especially since she once told him something and that night , repeated the identical thing on stage . Let's just say when something works , she keeps it . When she begs her young lover not to leave her , she says the same speech , word for word , she gave to another boyfriend . Bening is fabulous in this tour de force , and she looks beautiful and elegant in the gorgeous costumes . Someone commented that she bravely let Szabo photograph her in " unforgiving closeup , " but I'm sure there are plenty of 46 year-olds who wouldn't mind looking like Bening . This is a slight story but a highly entertaining one . My only complaint is the casting of Evans , and I do not understand how it is that casting people always , always get this wrong . When Linda Grey had a young boyfriend on " Dallas , " it was Christopher Atkins , which ruined the plot . I could go on , but these roles are often given to men who , first of all , are too young and look it , and secondly are too vapid . Someone on this site suggested Heath Ledger or Billy Crudup - uh , now you're talking . This kind of a role demands someone hot and of the type we older women would appreciate , not someone we want to pat on the head . Definitely worth seeing for Bening's performance and the great period atmosphere evoked in the film . Also , it's a film targeted to the over 40 demographic for a change .
494701	342623	37365	7.0	A delightful - and sober - Nick Charles returns to his hometown	It's 1945 , the trains are packed with people , Asta doesn't remain hidden under Nora's fur coat so Nick , Nora and Asta end up in the baggage car as they travel to Nick's home town . And Nick is drinking only cider - his father never approved of drink . Thus begins , " The Thin Man Goes Home , " made as the war was ending and a lot of people whose lives had changed were thinking about going home . Nick , it turns out , has an uneasy relationship with his doctor dad because he himself never became a doctor . When the inevitable mystery arises around a murder , Nora wants Nick to solve it to impress his dad . The fact is , the scripts of " The Thin Man " series never mattered . It was always the acting and interaction of William Powell and Myrna Loy , and here , as usual , they're great - loving , flippant , and funny . Since Nick is always falling on the floor or getting hit on the head , it's hard for anyone to believe he's sober . At a charity dance , in order to do some investigating , he gives his dance tickets to a sailor and Nora becomes his partner . The dance scene is hilarious as the sailor tosses Nora all over the place and swings her around with the kind of maneuvers you see in pair figure skating . The war is still on so the story involves espionage . A very young Gloria de Haven does nicely as a self-consciously over-dramatic young woman ; Harry Davenport and Lucile Watson are great as Nick's parents ; and the later blacklisted Anne Revere does a fine job as Crazy Mary . William Powell could read the phone book with class and humor ; Loy looks beautiful and their teamwork has never been better . Highly recommended .
493869	342623	26262	8.0	wild film	Spencer Tracy travels the seven rungs of hell in " Dante's Inferno , " a 1935 film costarring Claire Trevor and notable for a dance sequence featuring Rita Hayworth , still Rita Cansino . I actually hadn't realized Hayworth was in the film , but when I saw the dancer's smile , I recognized her immediately . Tracy plays a man who lucks into carnival barking as a result of meeting a man , played by Henry B . Walthall , who runs a concession known as " Dante's Inferno . " Walthall soon becomes Tracy's father-in-law , and Tracy becomes a successful businessman . He launches a huge , gaudy Inferno employing ruthless means to get the property . Though a wonderful husband and father , in his corporate world , he stops at nothing to get what he wants , including cheating , bribery , and ignoring possible dangers . The consequences are disastrous . The film has an obvious allegory , and I'm still laughing at a previous poster who noted that when Walthall goes through a book with Tracy and the seven rungs of hell come to life , everyone had great physiques so hell must not take chubsters ! It's true ! Other than hell's preference for perfect 10s , the effects are amazing - the Inferno concession , the images in the book that come to life , and the fantastic ship scene which uses the Inferno images to great effect . Spencer Tracy is excellent in his role , a tender dad , sweet husband and cruel businessman all at the same time . Claire Trevor is young and lovely and provides strong support for Tracy . A very interesting film and highly recommended .
494093	342623	43663	8.0	Strange title , good movie	Susan Hayward is a determined , talented and ambitious woman in " I Can Get it for You Wholesale , " a 1951 film which also stars George Sanders , Dan Dailey and Sam Jaffe . The title comes from the novel but the actual plot is only very loosely taken from the book . The beautiful Hayward plays Harriet Boyd , a dress model in a small business in New York's Garment District . She talks the owner ( Sam Jaffe ) into putting up some money and going into business with her so that she can launch her own line . She gets the top salesman ( Dan Dailey ) to do the same , and she manipulates her own sister into offering insurance money for Harriet's share in the business . Harriet's ability and drive get the business going , and she's all work . Though Danny Sherman ( Dailey ) is in love with her , she gives him the brush-off . The two eventually stop speaking when Danny catches having dinner with a wolf-like buyer ( Harry von Zell ) . One night , at a big buyer's dinner , she meets J . F . Noble , the head of Noble's Department Store , probably comparable to Saks Fifth Avenue . She wants to launch a line of gowns , which will mean getting out of her contract with her partners . Noble wants more than Harriet's gowns ; he wants Harriet as well . This is a very good drama with fine performances from everyone involved . Hayward , of course , carries the film as a driven woman who ends up having to question not only what she really wants but her own ethics and sense of responsibility . Sanders is great as the elegant Noble , representing , in a way , the devil , who knows Harriet's heart but wants her to sell her soul . Sam Jaffe is perfect as the grandfatherly boss , and Dan Dailey steps out of his dancing shoes and proves himself a good leading man . Highly recommended and a must for Hayward fans .
494920	342623	47885	8.0	The more things change , the more they remain the same	Glenn Ford enters the " Blackboard Jungle " in this 1955 film about high school youths . It also stars Vic Morrow , Sidney Poitier , Louis Calhern , Margaret Hayes , Richard Kiley , Anne Francis , Paul Mazursky and Jamie Farr . Ford is a young teacher who starts work at an urban school , only to learn that there is no discipline , precious little learning and that violence and racism are rampant . Though his colleagues are cynical , shell-shocked and / or burned out , Ford , who plays Richard Dadier , is determined to make the situation work . He has a pregnant wife at home and is committed to teaching . He tries different ways to get through to the students , including enlisting the help of one of the leaders ( Poitier ) , who initially rejects him . He and two other teachers ( Hayes and Kiley ) become victims of violence , and Dadier's wife begins receiving anonymous letters and phone calls suggesting that her husband is involved with an attractive teacher ( Hayes ) . The acting teacher Stella Adler claimed in one of her lectures that juvenile delinquency is a direct result of World War II , and there is a reference to that here - fatherless homes , working mothers and a general sense of world unrest . I had a teacher who used to say that with every war , people's manners became worse . One of the comments mentions that this film was not shocking when it was released ; I can believe it . Since I can remember , there have been schools where kids were unruly and violence occurred . Back in the ' 50s , over 50 % of students did not graduate from high school . What happened to them ? They entered the workforce . Today when a kid doesn't graduate from high school , it's a disaster because there's no workforce for them to enter . The film sports great direction by Richard Brooks , a wonderful soundtrack and superb acting , with Ford giving a fine performance as the determined Dadier . Richard Kiley does an excellent job as an idealistic teacher . Poitier plays a talented student , Gregory Miller , and he's very forceful , as is Vic Morrow as Artie West , an angry tough guy . The other students , such as Rafael Campos , Dan Terranova and Jamie Farr are very believable . " The Blackboard Jungle " doesn't offer much in the way of solutions , except that commitment and discipline do have an effect if you stick with it . I know several teachers who have walked into bad situations and done beautifully ; something happens when kids finally realize that you care . Unfortunately , there are all too few Richard Dadiers around and way too many Artie Wests .
493584	342623	34891	8.0	The effect of war	Naval men watch their ship sink as they cling to a raft and remember the lives they left in " In Which We Serve , " a 1942 film starring Noel Coward , John Mills , Celia Johnson , and Bernard Miles . The story takes place in World War II and shows how the war affected the British soldiers and their loved ones . Noel Coward also wrote and co-directed this film with David Lean . Like Coward's Brief Encounter , there are no glamorous movie star types . This is the story of the common man bound together by war and by their ship . Coward is Captain Kinross , who has a wife ( Celia Johnson ) and two children . John Mills is " Shorty , " a seaman who falls in love while on leave , gets married and has a short honeymoon . Bernard Miles is Walter Hardy , a happily married man whose wife hates having him go away . Each man reflects on his story in flashback . The impact of " In Which We Serve " must have been very powerful when it was first released . The announcement of war by the Prime Minister which comes over the radio is met with a chilling silence that the audience feels along with the men . The devastation of a blackout , the impact of the bombs at sea are very real . " In Which We Serve " is the story of a ship , the HMS Torrin , but we learn quickly that a ship is about its people , united in one cause and who share a special camaraderie . The captain's final speech to his men is highly emotional , all the more so because it is so restrained . All of the acting is top-notch . Someone commented that Coward seemed stiff . I think his role called for a certain formality . Hard to believe John Mills was ever that young . Celia Johnson , in her first film role , is wonderful . Coward obviously had no problems attracting the best actors to the film , as every person fits his or her role perfectly . Like many classics , despite changes in film technique , the core story remains compelling , especially today with so many soldiers in Iraq . In one scene , the camera falls on some of the seamen as they go to their stations to do battle . Each man was carefully chosen to show his extreme youth . It was a terrible time for the world , but somehow the film is strangely uplifting . A no-miss .
494402	342623	22279	8.0	very good adaptation	I had the pleasure several years ago of seeing Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman on Broadway in Noel Coward's durable comedy , " Private Lives , " and they were magnificent . I admit I had low expectations for a film version . I was pleasantly surprised that , though scenes were added and changed , the film keeps the tone of the play . I actually saw part of this movie when I was about nine years old . James Card of the George Eastman House introduced it on a weekly old film program . To a nine-year-old , it seemed very foreign , given its age . Strangely , I have always remembered the line , " We're married in the eyes of heaven " - from that TV showing ! And sure enough , my memory was correct - that either says something about Montgomery's line reading , or that I had no understanding of what the line meant , or I have a weird memory . Not sure . I thought the two stars , Robert Montgomery and Norma Shearer , portrayed the couple excellently . Shearer is so often criticized for her acting , but I'm sorry , I've seen her in some very good performances , although I grant you , she was a movie star first and foremost . The couple also has great chemistry . I understand the apartment in Paris was changed to attract the German market , which eliminated the great part of the maid . In the end , the film is very enjoyable and the play , of course , set the stage for many ripoffs . I agree with another of the comments , it would have been fabulous to have Coward and Lawrence preserved on film .
495039	342623	52911	8.0	Great send-up of manager versus labor union relations	A young man ( Ian Carmichael ) works too fast and causes problems with the labor union in " I'm All Right Jack , " a 1959 British film directed by John Boulting . Boulting actually lost a suit against a labor union . This is his revenge . Stanley Windrush ( Carmichael ) is from a wealthy family and , after returning from the war , he wants to be in business . It's arranged for him to work at his uncle's firm as a laborer , against the wishes of his aunt ( Margaret Rutherford ) and work his way up . Unfortunately , Stanley just doesn't get it . At first he's suspected of being an efficiency expert designed as an employee , something the whole factory fears . Then he inadvertently does his job in front of an efficiency expert . It's found that he works faster than the other employees . This infuriates the union , who - again - go on strike , which they do every couple of weeks . It takes Stanley a while to figure out what's going on , but he does , in time for a television talk show . This film is known today for the brilliant performance of Peter Sellers as the shop steward , whose politics , he says , are private . He's fabulous . The film also features Terry Thomas , also very funny , and other excellent actors , such as Dennis Price and Richard Attenborough . Having worked in theater and read up on a recent Broadway strike , Boulting doesn't miss much . When Windrush asks why a bunch of men playing cards aren't working , in fact , unions often have quotas of how many people have to be hired , whether they're needed or not . Many people , of course , misses the point of unions . If people treated each other like human beings , we wouldn't have needed unions in the first place . However , " I'm All Right , Jack " understands , as Windrush's impassioned speech tells us . As long as I'm okay , I don't care what happens to you . It's an unfortunate if honest message . Don't miss this one .
493888	342623	35417	8.0	Colman , Grant and Arthur - how can it miss ? It doesn't .	Cary Grant is Leopold Dilg , " The Talk of the Town , " in this 1942 film also starring Ronald Colman and Jean Arthur . The outspoken Digl is framed for arson and murder and escapes from prison . He ends up in the home of a schoolteacher he's known since childhood , Nora Shelley . She's preparing her home to be rented the next day - except the renter , an attorney named Professor Lightcap ( Colman ) shows up right then . Since Leopold has a bad ankle , Nora lets him hide in the attic . Though Lightcap wants peace and quiet to write a book , things don't quite happen that way . Nora insists on being his secretary / cook - because she has to take care of Leopold - and every time Lightcap turns around , there's Nora's mother , the police looking for Dilg , furniture deliveries and a delivery of all of Nora's clothing - before he agrees to hire her . Nora and Dilg's attorney Yates ( Edgar Buchanan ) attempt to drag the brilliant ivory tower attorney into the unfair assumption of guilt of Dilg , but Lightcap refuses . His type of justice , it seems , is all on paper . He doesn't want to get involved with any real people . Leopold , posing as the family gardener , gets into some heated discussions with him , and at Leopold's urging , Nora gives Lightcap special attention . But is any of it enough to make him cave and help Digl ? This is a grand comedy with very serious undertones . Who would ever expect two of the most elegant men in film history , Grant and Colman , to be facing off in a comedy , no less , where one of them is very definitely NOT elegant . Grant is terrific , a truly great actor who rarely let his audience see anything but the famous " Cary Grant " persona . Here , he's a man of the people with a clumsy walk and casual clothes . His pantomime to Nora through his attic window of wanting something to eat is hilarious . The bearded Colman plays the role of a stuffy professor very straight . Lightcap is barely able to stand the chicanery of Nora's household at first , as he has a strict routine . Fast forward and he's flirting and dancing with a smart-mouthed beautician ( Glenda Farrell ) in order to pump her for information about her boyfriend . His acting , particularly his courtroom speech toward the end of the film , is magnificent . Arthur plays Nora as a dizzy , confused and nervous woman , completely thrown as a landlord , a friend and a woman by the appearance of Leopold and the brilliance of Lightcap , as well as his admiration of her . She's torn between the two of them - and keeps the audience wondering . Really a must-see for the lesson that true justice must be not read , not preached , but lived and for the wonderful characterizations and direction by Stevens .
495038	342623	36323	8.0	Very good war drama	" Sahara " is a 1943 film starring Humphrey Bogart , directed by Zoltan Korda , and intended as a propaganda film during World War II . It succeeds . Bogart is a Sgt . Joe Gunn , and after Tobruk falls in North Africa , he leads a tank unit into the desert . He's joined by French , South African , British , and Sudanese soldiers . They come up against a group of Germans that want the water well where the tanks are stationed . Besides Bogart , the great cast includes Bruce Bennett . Lloyd Bridges , Dan Duryea and J . Carrol Naish , and they all do an exemplary job . What I like best about this film is the atmosphere - the sun beating down , the dryness , the filth - you're thirsty just watching it . It was films like this that probably kept people in the U . S . going during the war , I imagine . World War II has been highly romanticized , but despite the pretty songs , there wasn't anything romantic about it . Since there are no women in this film , there's nothing romantic about " Sahara " either . Very good work .
493638	342623	36342	8.0	Hitchcock's favorite film	Hitchcock claimed that Shadow of a Doubt was his favorite movie . There is one funny story about it , which is that after making great efforts to find the perfect house in Santa Rosa , California in which to make the film , the family was so excited , they had the place painted - which wasn't what he wanted . Nevertheless , the house still stands in Santa Rosa today . This is a wonderful film about The Merry Widow killer , a visiting uncle , and the adoring niece named after him . Hitchcock believed that villains had to be attractive , not slimy - otherwise , how could they con anyone ? So he chose Joseph Cotten , who is charming and smooth as Uncle Charlie . Theresa Wright is excellent as the young niece living in Small Town , USA , who is about to learn a hard life lesson . There are several things I love about the film : One - the bizarre murder plots concocted by Henry Travers , who plays Wright's father , and his friend , played by Hume Cronyn . As they discuss abstract killings , there is a murderer in their midst . Another thing , much more subtle , demonstrates Hitchcock's tremendous knowledge of human beings . None of the little children want to sit next to Uncle Charlie . Pure spirits , children always know when someone isn't quite right . MacDonald Carey is one of the investigating detectives who has a lovely scene with Wright at the end of the film . One of the comments for this film stated that World War II is never mentioned . Not directly - but watch the end of the movie again .

The film also stars Errol Flynn and Claude Rains . When Tom , the pauper , is caught by the guards , the young Prince sees a playmate in him and invites him in . They change clothes so that the Prince can go and get his dog from the kennel for their next game , but he's caught by the cruel guards who think he's the pauper . This leaves the hapless Tom stuck in the palace as a prince who is about to become king any minute . He has a protector forced upon him , the Earl of Hertford ( Rains ) , who does not have the best interests of the English people in mind . While he's in Tom's world , Prince Edward gets a good look at the horrible way the English people are forced to live because of bad laws . Eventually he meets Miles Hendon ( Flynn ) who saves him from Tom's wretched father . The question is , once Hendon is convinced that he's in the presence of the true King , can he get him to the coronation before the beggar is crowned ? This is a wonderfully fun movie , filled with the meanest of the mean in Alan Hale as a palace guard , Barton MacLane as Tom's father , and the diabolical , unfeeling Earl . All are very convincing . The twins are delightful . As for Errol Flynn , he's as dashing and charming as ever as he wields a sword and rides a horse . A great cast and a marvelous film for the whole family . Highly recommended .
494815	342623	67240	8.0	entertaining	This was a great script from the prolific Larry Cohen , who wrote episodes for " Columbo , " " Arrest and Trial " ( a forerunner of " Law and Order " ) and episodes for Kraft Suspense Theater and " The Defenders . " He has also written feature films . I'd love to see this film again - I wish it would come out on video . It stars Richard Boone as a newly-blinded actor and Suzanne Pleshette as his teacher . Though the Boone character puts on a big show for Pleshette of refusing to accept his blindness , he coldly and calculatedly trains himself to act as a seeing man so that , in disguise , he can get rid of his wife and her lover . It's a suspenseful story , a fascinating character-study and all around great entertainment . For some reason , this kind of TV movie fare has gone out of style and been replaced by women at risk films , rather slow-moving versions of Robin Cook and Mary Higgins Clark novels and the like . But we mystery buffs old enough to remember the ' 70s remember - with nostalgia - this kind of film .
494890	342623	40416	8.0	A blond Olivier takes on the Prince of Denmark	Laurence Olivier is " Hamlet " in this 1948 version of Shakespeare's play . The film , directed by Olivier , also stars Eileen Herlie , Jean Simmons , Norman Wooland , Felix Aylmer , Stanley Holloway and Terrence Morgan . Olivier's Hamlet on stage , of course , was very famous and modeled after John Barrymore's portrayal . Not as athletic as Gielgud's portrayal , Olivier's Shakespeare work was notable for the fact that he didn't " sing " the text , but rather said it realistically . For his film version of Richard III , he deliberately made the setting look false , making the point that , if you gave the audience a realistic-looking setting , they would then ask , " Why are these people talking so funny ? " Similarly , for Hamlet , the castle is a stark , huge affair , standing in the midst of fog , and unusual camera angles are used to make some stunning shots . The text of the play is heavily cut , and two characters , Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are indeed dead - they don't exist here . The cast is good - it can't compare with Olivier's Richard III cast seven years later - but it's Olivier's show , and he's tremendous , giving a thrilling performance . As many times as I've seen Hamlet , I'm always impressed at how many famous phrases have come out of it . But with such a compelling story and such beautiful writing , it's no surprise . Outrageous fortune indeed .

Mitchum , in probably his best role , plays the psychotic Max Cady , a man with an easy smile and laid back attitude who is pure evil . He is determined that Sam Bowden ( Peck ) , whose testimony in an assault case sent him up the river for 8 years , will pay for what he did via his family - his wife , Peggy , and his young daughter Nancy . Bowden is a distinguished attorney and gets some help from a police chief ( Balsam ) , but apparently during his time in stir , Cady studied the law . He goes so far and no further by being a menacing presence who does nothing . When Bowden takes the advice of a detective ( Savalas ) and has Cady beat up by some thugs , Cady gets the law on his side , and Bowden faces disbarment . His only hope is to catch Cady in the act . He comes with an elaborate plot to catch Cady before Nancy and Peggy are hurt . This is an excellent drama with a pivotal performance from Mitchum , who is fantastic as the disgusting Cady . Peck is very good , though perhaps too measured , as Bowden , and Polly Bergen lets out all the stops , particularly in her final scene with Cady , some of which was improvised by Mitchum . My only complaint is the predictability of Cady killing the family dog . Every time there's an animal in this type of film , you know it's doomed , and it gets tiresome . Someday perhaps a writer will be able to come up with something to replace this tired cliché . The beautiful Barrie Chase , the sensational dancer who performed with Fred Astaire on his television shows , has a nice role here as Cady's pick-up ; Lori Martin , who resembles Elizabeth Taylor and played her role in the TV series " National Velvet " is the daughter here . She is a mix of good looks , innocence , and youth which makes her particularly attractive to Cady . All in all , a tense , well-paced film with some genuinely terrifying moments and a genuinely terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum , which really makes the movie .
494242	342623	44391	8.0	wonderful film about a Hollywood producer and his victims	Lana Turner , Dick Powell , and Barry Sullivan play three victims of an ambitious producer ( Kirk Douglas ) in " The Bad and the Beautiful . " This 1952 film sports great direction by Vincente Minnelli and a top-notch cast , including the above and Walter Pidgeon , Gloria Grahame , Gilbert Roland , and Elaine Stewart . Kirk Douglas was never better or more handsome than as producer Jonathan Shields , who manages to alienate a lot of people he meets on his climb up . The story begins after he's lost everything , and his old boss , Pidgeon , brings Shields ' old partner , Barry Sullivan , an old lover , Lana Turner , and a writer , Dick Powell together to ask them to work with Shields one more time to restore his reputation . With them on board , Pidgeon can raise the funding for the proposed film in seconds . But none of them will ever work with Shields again , and each one , in flashbacks , tells Pidgeon why . The acting , the plot , the dialogue , and the music are all great . What's interesting is that the film takes us behind the scenes of making a movie and working at a studio , which is fascinating as well as entertaining . The only problematic scene is an hysterical Lana driving in the rain - again - as she did in " Portrait in Black . " I've seen this scene shown at parties for laughs . It's over the top and campy . Other than that , there's not a wrong step . Lana is gorgeous and convincing as a down and out bit player turned star , a sort of Diana Barrymore , with a famous drunken father . This is an entertaining and absorbing film with Kirk Douglas at the top of his game in a role that seems tailor-made for him .
493872	342623	40498	8.0	Greer lets her hair down	Greer Garson is again teamed up with Walter Pidgeon in the delightful comedy , " Julia Misbehaves , " which also stars 16-year-old Elizabeth Taylor and a very adorable Peter Lawford . Taylor and Lawford are a subplot in this film , which mainly concerns Garson as Julia , an entertainer , showing up to attend the wedding of the daughter she hasn't seen since infancy . Because of the breakup of her marriage and her transient lifestyle , she left the child with her husband's family . This is a fun movie with some great scenes , the best of which is an acrobatic act featuring Julia . It is hilarious . Cesar Romero makes a game attempt at a Cockney accent , and is very good as Nicky , the head of the act who is interested in marrying Julia . Nigel Bruce is a man conned out of 6950 francs by Julia , and Lucile Watson is Julia's disapproving mother-in-law . Pidgeon plays Julia's husband , who hasn't seen her in years , but on encountering her again , realizes what he's been missing . Wedding plans don't go as expected once Julia is in the house . A very pretty Elizabeth Taylor gets her first screen kiss from Lawford , and they make a charming couple . But this isn't their film , it's Garson's , in a different type of role for her . She is up to the task . Over the years , perhaps due to some of the sentimental movies she made and being raked over the coals by Pauline Kael , Garson's reputation has suffered . However , she is terrific in " Julia Misbehaves , " and this entertaining film is well worth seeing .
494681	342623	48210	8.0	Superbly told story of the great soprano	Like others commenting on this film , I saw " Interrupted Melody " many years ago , and it left a deep impression on me . I found when watching it again that I had retained so many of the scenes in my memory . " Interrupted Melody " tells the story of Australian soprano Marjorie Lawrence ( played by Eleanor Parker ) , who was stricken with polio at the height of her career . The singer then has to find the courage to reclaim her will to live , her voice , and her career . This is one of the few films , including anything of Lanza's , where entire arias and / or operatic scenes have been performed - and correctly . Singing for Ms . Parker is dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell , whose voice also acts . In the beginning , when the young Marjorie is in a vocal competition , Farrell takes her powerful chest voice out and instead carries her middle voice down to the low notes , giving the impression of a young , untrained singer . Truly inspired . This has to be the high point of Eleanor Parker's career . I had a chance to see her nearly 30 years ago in a preview performance of " Pal Joey " - regretfully , there were many problems and she and her costar left the show before it opened . It was a shame , because Parker's Vera was wonderful . Here , she plays the young Marjorie with energy and determination , capturing the soprano's nervousness at being away from home when she goes to school in Monte Carlo . Later , she plays the perfect diva not afraid to state what she wants . Finally , she's the crippled Marjorie with no will to live , finding solace entertaining wounded soldiers who are worse off than she is . All through the film , she looks absolutely stunning , and her lipsyncing in Italian , French , and German is perfect . The music is glorious - " Tristan und Isolde , " " La Boheme , " " Samson et Delilah , " " Carmen , " " Il Trovatore , " ( the fastest I've ever heard it ) , " Madama Butterfly , " " Don Carlos , " and " Gotterdammerung " - truly a feast for the ears with Eileen Farrell's magnificent singing . Some have questioned whether or not Lawrence actually sang both mezzo and soprano roles . Lawrence did sing " Carmen , " which can be sung by a dramatic soprano . Also , Lawrence probably started out as a mezzo - it was not until she trained in Paris that her upper range was extended . She sang Wagner , Strauss , Puccini , and Verdi in the big opera houses . " Samson and Delilah " was perhaps done for the film so we could see Eleanor Parker being sexy and seductive in a gauzy costume . The thing is , Lawrence's specialty was Wagner and you can't only have heavy Wagner scenes throughout a movie . The glamorous soprano did her own dancing in " Salome , " and played the immolation scene in " Götterdämmerung " by riding her horse into the flames as Wagner had intended , making her one of the few , possibly the only , soprano to do this . She also did Thais , which calls for sex and beauty - it was the role Susan Kane bombed in during " Citizen Kane . " Glenn Ford plays Lawrence's husband , Dr . Thomas King , and the marriage of a successful opera star and fledgling pediatrician is realistically portrayed with all its difficulties . In real life , Tom King was an osteopath and a Christian Scientist . Ford has a background role much of the time , but also some very dramatic moments and some romantic ones . His gentle , easygoing style fit the character well . A very young Roger Moore is Marjorie's manager-brother . If you love opera , or if you love a story of courage and the power of the human spirit , this film is for you . Have a box of tissues nearby - the ending is very powerful .
494395	342623	101694	8.0	Thriller starring Goldie Hawn and John Heard	Adrienne and Jack meet , fall in love , marry , have a child , and live in a wonderful New York apartment . Then Jack is killed in a car crash . Slowly , things start to unravel for Adrienne in " Deceived , " a 1991 film starring Goldie Hawn and John Heard . This is a highly derivative movie concerning fake museum pieces , fake identity , and a double life , but it manages to be exciting and occasionally scary . As other people have commented , there are plot holes aplenty . Hawn and Heard are both marvelous in their roles , Hawn for a change in a serious part . She shows she's as talented a " straight " actress as she is a comedienne . The final big scene will keep you on the edge of your seat , and the climax of it is a knockout . This could have been one of the great movies if the script had been tighter because it is very well directed and performed with some excellent camera work and great music . Despite script holes , I still found it entertaining . I wouldn't have minded paying good money to see it in the theater , and it makes a riveting rental .
493855	342623	116908	8.0	Geena is fantastic !	Geena Davis , Samuel Jackson and Craig Bierko star in " The Long Kiss Goodnight , " a 1996 film that had a woman in the Arnold Schwarzenegger role for a change . Maybe that's why some people didn't like it , but I loved it . I thought it rocked , and I thought Davis did a terrific job as Samantha , an amnesia victim living with her husband and child and working as a school teacher . After a horrible accident , elements of her old self start to emerge - a facility with knives , strange behavior - and then people start trying to kill her after she appears on television in a holiday parade . A detective who's been trying to dig up info about her ( Jackson ) has found out some information - and Samantha has to leave her family and go on the road with Jackson in search of her true self . Gradually , all of the danger that she's in forces her old self to completely emerge - Charley Baltimore , government assassin . This film will keep you glued to the TV . It packs in a lot of action , a lot of excitement , and a lot of suspense . It also has some wonderful performances . Craig Bierko plays the most evil man who ever lived , I swear - and this guy was the Music Man on Broadway . Samuel L . Jackson is excellent as the detective who had no idea what he was getting into . And Davis is incredible - a sweet mom one day , with flowing locks and a radiant smile - to a cold-blooded , foul mouthed killer the next , with short blond hair and artillery . As someone mentioned here , the script treats this not as amnesia but as a real split personality . Davis and Jackson are dynamic together , playing off one another beautifully . I mustn't forget the great comedy embedded in this film and the witty dialogue . The sound track is great . The plot is also fascinating , given that this was made in 1996 . The premise is that a government agency , in order to get more funding , is going to launch a terrorist attack , killing 4 , 000 people and blame it on the Muslims . References are made to the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 . Doubt this film would be made today . Apparently this bombed at the box office . They say most films are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand . Maybe they don't like seeing a woman in charge . For people who complain it's not a plausible script , right , and I suppose all of Arnold's were . Don't miss it . Geena makes The Terminator look like a wimp .
494916	342623	48401	8.0	Lovely underrated musical	Betty Garrett and Janet Leigh star in " My Sister Eileen , " a 1955 musical also starring Jack Lemmon , Bob Fosse , Tommy Rall and Kurt Kasznar . This is not the musical " Wonderful Town " but it has delightful music by Jule Style . It's the story of the Sherwood Girls , Ruth and Eileen , who come to Greenwich Village from Ohio to " make it " - Eileen as a performer and Ruth as a writer . The two are conned by a landlord ( Kasznar ) into renting ( for a whopping $65 a month ) a basement apartment that shakes like crazy during subway construction . Not to mention , with their window placed the way it is , they may as well be living in the street . The Ruth character is based on the writer of the original story , Ruth McKenney . Eileen is the freshly beautiful blonde who always has men swarming around her ; in comparison , the pretty , funny and stylish Ruth feels like a plain Jane . She sublimates by being dedicated to her career until she meets a publisher ( Jack Lemmon ) and falls for him . He's interested in her story , " My Sister Eileen , " and she's so insecure , she tells him that she is the sought after Eileen - it's another aspect of her personality , she says . The Greenwich Village aspect makes the film as the movie captures its atmosphere perfectly and gives a real feel for the New York of the 1950s . Betty Garrett is great as Ruth . Her singing and acting are both wonderful . Surprisingly , though it's the title role , the part of Eileen really isn't much . ( Sadly , the real Eileen died very young . She married writer Nathanael West and died with him 8 months later in a 1940 car accident . ) Janet Leigh is pretty and sweet , putting over the necessary naiveté as Eileen , plus she gets to show off her singing and dancing . Fosse , who also choreographed , and Tommy Rall are suitors of Eileen and do some fabulous dancing . Dick York has a small but showy role as a young man in Ruth's and Eileen's building . Jack Lemmon , in an early role , is slightly miscast as the sophisticated publisher but is very likable . Well-directed by Richard Quine , it's a shame that " My Sister Eileen " hasn't gotten more attention . It's pretty to look at and to listen to with wonderful , vibrant performances . Check it out .
495091	342623	36367	8.0	Excellent film chronicling the nurses on Bataan	Claudette Colbert heads up a team of army nurses caring for the wounded and dying in " So Proudly We Hail ! " It's a great ensemble of fine actresses , including Paulette Goddard , Veronica Lake , Barbara Britton and others . This is the women's story , not often told , but certainly harrowing and inspiring . These nurses are in the Phillipines when MacArthur pulls out and they become stranded on Corregidor . The film is told in flashbacks , when the women are actually on their way home by ship , and Colbert , who plays " Davy " ( Janet Davidson ) is catatonic . The ship's doctor is trying to figure out how to help her and asks the women to tell their story . It's a rough one , filled with bombings , filth , malaria , little food , exhaustion , and dying . When " So Proudly We Hail ! " was released , no one knew how the war would end as we do now , and the fall of the Philippines was seen as a major defeat for the U . S . I suspect that although the impact of seeing it today is very strong , it must have been a lot stronger for wartime audiences . As mentioned , it was wartime , so Hollywood didn't have a lot of men to choose from . George Reeves - today himself the subject of a film - plays Davy's love interest , John , and he's not only hunky but excellent . I couldn't figure out if he had a good speaking voice or I was just so used to hearing it after growing up with " Superman . " But he's very effective , and it's sad that after serving in the war , he couldn't get his career back on track . Unfortunately , that happened to many actors who were just getting a foothold when war broke out . The other actor is the often maligned Sonny Tufts , a big , good looking blond who wasn't much of an actor , but he doesn't detract from the film either . He was probably more suited to this role than he was to others later on . But this is a women's movie all the way . At 40 , Colbert was probably a little old for the role . However , she does a good job as a tough but motherly woman , protective of her nurses and quite the rule-breaker herself after she meets John . Veronica Lake gives what is perhaps her best performance as the angry Olivia . The supporting Oscar nomination should have gone to her - it's a showy role , and she does a fantastic job . Paulette Goddard did receive the nomination . She's a flirty , sexy man magnet and extremely likable . I've always thought in real life , with all that charm and charisma , she must have had to beat men off with a stick . " So Proudly We Hail ! " gives as realistic a depiction of the conditions of war and the tremendous work of the nurses who served . It covers the same material as the excellent " Cry Havoc ! " - also about nurses on Bataan . I highly recommend both films . As a bit of trivia , there were nurses who did not get out of Corregidor and were captured . They worked in the prison hospitals and had to endure terrible conditions , but surprisingly , they did survive - a tribute to their incredible inner strength and devotion to the wounded .
494326	342623	85568	8.0	stunning film about Clara Wieck	And who , might you ask , is Clara Wieck ? Well , if she hadn't married Schumann , she might have been much more famous than he . Her pianist abilities were thought to be equal to or greater than those of Franz Liszt . I had the privilege of seeing this film in New York City in a small theater , subtitled . A friend of mine rented it and , unlike one of the posters , his film was dubbed in English . I am glad I got to see the German version . This is a beautiful film with a feminist bend to it , being the story of a brilliantly talented young woman exploited by her father and Schumann , who becomes her husband . Kinski is absolutely wonderful and beautiful . Also , her piano fingerings are great . There is an interesting line at the end , where Wieck says , talking about her home with Schumann , " I hope there will be room for two pianos . " Of course there weren't , and she was forever known as Clara Schumann . The film doesn't go into the fact that Clara Schumann did have a career after marriage , however , and a good part of her relationship with her husband revolved around their mutual passion for music . She had 8 children but managed to compose and do concert tours , often with her husband , until he was institutionalized . After Schumann's death , with the help of Brahms , she continued to do concerts though plagued by various ailments . Try to see this film in German with subtitles if at all possible .
495191	342623	36891	8.0	a 4F returns home a war hero	Preston Sturges wrote and directed the 1944 film " Hail the Conquering Hero , " which stars Eddie Bracken , William Demarest , Ella Raines and Franklin Pangborn . Bracken is Woodrow Truesmith , whose father was a famous war hero . Woodrow , however , is 4F because of hay fever . Discharged and depressed , he sits in a bar delaying going home . He confesses the truth to some marines he meets in a bar , and they decide to accompany him home to back up the story he told his mother - that he's in a hospital overseas due to war injuries . When he arrives home , he has a hero's welcome . Later there's a statue and a song . Then the town wants him to be mayor . Sturges ' gift was coming up with wacky plots , while others of the era could create wacky situations within a plot . This one is pretty outrageous . As Woodrow feels more and more guilty , the public adulation becomes bigger and bigger . It's a strong message about people believing what they want to believe and their need for a hero . Bracken plays his role very seriously and lets the situation and the lines get the laughs . His character looks and feels trapped . Ella Raines plays his ex-fiancée , and she's very beautiful - a cross between Jeanne Crain and Gene Tierney , she gives a very sweet and sincere performance . She was a very underrated actress and beauty who for some reason never reached the top tier of stardom ; today she is remembered for some wonderful film noirs in which she appeared . William Demarest is very funny as the marine helping to keep the story alive - at any cost . I enjoyed " The Lady Eve , " " The Palm Beach Story , " and " Sullivan's Travels " better , mainly because of their casts , but for Sturges fans , this is a must see .
494831	342623	68248	8.0	psychic phenomenon , satanic worship and more	Leonard Nimoy stars as a race car driver with psychic visions in " Baffled ! " also starring Susan Hampshire , Vera Miles , Rachel Roberts , and Jewel Blanch . After the Nimoy character reports on television that he had a vision that caused him to lose control of his race car during a competition , he is visited by Susan Hampshire . She is a student of psychic phenomenon and believes he should follow up on what he saw - a manor house in England , the phrase " It's Wyndham in Devon , dear , " and a familiar-looking woman who is need of help . He agrees to join her after he has another vision which is much stronger - - and scarier - than the previous one . The two of them end up at a manor house which has been turned into a sort of resort hotel . There , they meet the woman of the vision - an American film star who is waiting for her ex-husband , her young daughter , and some rather strange characters . Judging by what happens at the end of this entertaining movie , " Baffled " seems to have been a pilot for a TV series . The stars - Hampshire and Nimoy - are delightful , and the story is an interesting one that manages to tie in not only psychic phenomenon but a satanic element as well . Vera Miles does an effective job as a woman anticipating a reunion with her ex , Rachel Roberts is terrific as the owner of Wyndham , and Jewel Blanch is very good as Miles ' daughter . This intriguing story will hold the viewer's interest , and it is immensely helped by the likability of the main characters .
494271	342623	32617	8.0	Delightful William Powell and Myrna Loy vehicle	After saving a life , William Powell becomes the victim of amnesia in " I Love You Again , " a 1940 film also starring Frank McHugh and Edmund Lowe - this having the distinction of two Philo Vances , Lowe and Powell , in the cast . Powell plays a cheapskate named Larry Wilson . While on a cruise ship , he jumps into the ocean to save " Doc " Ryan ( McHugh ) and suffers a head injury . When he wakes up , he has become his former self , a con artist named George and has no memory of the respectable , conservative , stingy life he has been living for some years . Off the ship , he discovers that his lovely wife ( Loy ) can't wait to get rid of him - or so she thinks , until she realizes that " Larry " is a changed man - for the better . Powell is out and out hilarious in this film . For such a distinguished looking man , he has provided this writer with almost as many laugh out loud moments as the Marx Brothers . One of his best scenes is when his wife refuses to dance with him , so he dances by himself . Another occurs when , as a boy scout troop leader , he is asked to continue with the deer-tracking techniques he was teaching before leaving town . Of course , he has no memory of any such thing and , as a reporter follows him , he falls into holes , crawls around the brush , and gets stuck in a couple of traps . The pairing of Powell and Loy is magical . She looks particularly beautiful in this film and her confusion regarding her changed husband and sadness over her marriage is quite touching . Highly recommended .
493570	342623	433383	8.0	Clash of the Titans	Edward R . Murrow goes up against Senator Joseph McCarthy in " Good Night , and Good Luck , " a 2005 using Murrow's famous sign-off on the news program " See It Now " as its title . The stars are David Strathairn , George Clooney , Jeff Daniels , Patricia Clarkson , Ray Wise , Frank Langella , and Robert Downey , Jr . The story is set during the time of the HUAC investigations , when Murrow was one of the few newsmen willing to go up against the powerful senator who saw a Communist under every bed , Joseph McCarthy . It's an especially timely story post - as it concerns the violation of civil rights and use of fear tactics in order to exploit the insecurity rampant in the country at that time . Director / writer George Clooney couldn't have chosen a better subject . Like the film " Thirteen Days " about the Cuban missile crisis , the brilliance of the film is in its use of actual transcripts , here from " See it Now . " In the case of " Good Night , and Good Luck , " we also see real footage from the investigations and hear Joseph McCarthy himself as he goes after witnesses and Murrow . It makes for fascinating viewing . Though there were some minor errors , the attention to detail to evoke the ' 50s atmosphere is fantastic , the black and white only adding to it . The acting is superb , if you can call what David Strahairn did acting . I felt throughout the entire film that I was watching Edward R . Murrow , not someone portraying him . Strathairn is a flawless actor who becomes the character he's playing and makes every mannerism , vocal rhythm , and cigarette puff totally organic . His Murrow is tough , with internalized anger and a dry sense of humor . " I'm busy bringing down your network tonight , " he tells Paley as he refuses an invitation . Frank Langella's William Paley is marvelous , a man who tries to walk the fence but ends up falling over to one side . I probably already knew somewhere in the recesses of my mind about Don Hollenbeck , the character well portrayed by Ray Wise ; that story arc was telegraphed from the beginning . It might have been criticized for being a cliché , except of course it really happened . Hollenbeck's story was perhaps not fleshed out enough . All in all , a brilliant achievement and a sad one . Without people like Murrow , journalism has changed , and not for the better ? And the world ? Though the names of the threats and their exploiters have changed , the fault , dear Brutus , still doesn't lie within our stars , but in ourselves .
495004	342623	24034	8.0	The granddaddy of them all	The only other time I saw " 42nd Street " besides on TCM recently was at a revival cinema many years ago . The audience spent most of its time in hysterics during the most serious parts . The reason is obvious . Thanks to " Dames at Sea " and the million " chorus girl becomes a star " stories that followed this 1933 film , 42nd Street almost seems like an excellent parody of itself - deadly serious while the ripoffs were camping it up . But that's exactly why I love " 42nd Street " and why it's a great film - beneath the miles of chorus girl legs and breezy tunes , it's a Depression-era story about a director's last gasp . Warner Baxter is Julian Marsh , the browbeating director who indicates to one of his assistants that he's " ill , " the implication being he hasn't got much time left . Not hard to believe as he smokes one cigarette after another and yells so much that his blood pressure must be off the charts . Ruby Keeler is Peggy Sawyer , one of the chorus girls , and like the rest of them , she needs the job . Dick Powell is the juvenile lead , and Bebe Daniels is the star of the show , Dorothy Brock . Ginger Rogers has a nifty role as the chorus girl known as " Anytime Annie " - " the only time she said no , she didn't hear the question . " In those days , latching onto a Sugar Daddy was the big thing , and Ginger has no problem in that department . George Brent , sans mustache , is Brock's ex-partner who takes a shine to Keeler . The dandy supporting cast includes Una Merkel , Ned Sparks , and Allen Jenkins . When you watch " 42nd Street " you understand where the term " hoofing " comes from in relationship to tap dancing . Seeing ( and hearing ) the chorus rehearse , one wonders why Marsh didn't just pack it in . But of course , the opening night show is a wow , with Busby Berkeley's choreography coming to the fore in " Shuffle Off to Buffalo " and the brilliant production number " 42nd Street " - which shows the savory and unsavory sides of Times Square before Disney took it over . Berkeley's work in this film made him a superstar film choreographer , though he'd been toiling in Hollywood for a few years by then . Ruby Keeler is cute but lousy , and the idea of her saving a musical is ludicrous . Dick Powell plays the juvenile well , but of course , he went on to not only become a wonderful serious actor but a terrific producer , so this was just the tip of the iceberg for him . Daniels is great , if melodramatic by today's standards - as she limps around on her crutches , one gets a sudden vision of Carol Burnett doing that in a skit . Baxter is appropriately tough and says the most famous line , " You're going out a chorus girl , but you must come back a star . " He also gives us the downbeat scene at the end of the film that makes " 42nd Street " different from all the rest , when he sits on the fire escape in the theater alley listening to the audience as they leave the show . " 42nd Street " spawned dozens of movie musicals in the ' 30s , actually reviving the genre . None of them compare - and that includes the Broadway musical derived from the film - because none of them have the darker , grittier , Depression subtext that makes " 42nd Street " true to its name .
494250	342623	28333	8.0	heavenly dancing , heavenly music , heavenly partnership	There's something special about all of the Astaire-Rogers movies , and " Swing Time " is no exception . Directed by George Stevens , it tells the story of a dancer and a gambler - not seen as much of a catch by his future father-in-law - who , after he misses his wedding , goes to New York . He promises his fiancée's father that he will return , solvent , and ask again for his daughter's hand in marriage . Once in New York , he falls for Ginger Rogers , who was never prettier than in this film . One thing leads to another , and the wind up as dance partners . Eric Blore , Helen Broderick , and Victor Moore supply able support , and the film has a beautiful Jerome Kern score : " Pick Yourself Up , " " The Way You Look Tonight , " and " A Fine Romance " being a few of the numbers . There are two knockout pieces in this film - Astaire's tribute to Bill " Bojangles " Robinson is one of the most stunning numbers Astaire ever did . He manages to wear blackface and not have it be offensive , as it's very light makeup to suggest his portrayal of Robinson . The number , with its accompanying huge dancing shadows , is magnificent . And the final number - " Never Gonna Dance " surely is one of their top dances ever , with that incredible deco set , the double curving stairways , and Ginger in that glorious dress . It's hard to sum up how their dancing lifts you up and out of whatever ails you . Definitely their smoothness , footwork , chemistry , and glamor reach out to my soul every time I see them .
493793	342623	120382	8.0	Deceptive	Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey ) is the star of " The Truman Show " in this 1998 film directed by Peter Weir . Truman's life is a fake reality show , watched by millions of viewers , though he doesn't know that . He lives in the small seaside town of Seahaven , a peaceful place . Truman is married , has a best friend and works as an insurance agent . He has an unnatural fear of water after being in a boating accident in which his father died . One day he boards an elevator and it isn't an elevator ; he sees his dead father in town ; and a woman has a strange message for him that he doesn't understand . He tries to leave town with his wife , and it simply doesn't happen . The " reality , " if there is one , is that Truman doesn't really exist ; the town is fake , filled with actors ( one of whom , the man who played his father , comes back to make trouble ) . That person on the bicycle , the passing car , etc . , that's on a repeating loop . He has a public he has never met who follow each phase of life with interest . His producer , the man who created Truman , is a man named Christof , who took an illegitimate child and turned him into a media star . When Truman tries to get out , he realizes just how trapped he is . With today's reality shows abounding , " The Truman Show " today is even more fascinating than it was in 1998 . Here's a reality show that's not a reality - and it makes you wonder about what we're watching on reality shows today . It brings up all the metaphysical questions of who am I and who made me . The film also asks us to take a look at our attraction to the lives of celebrities , where people are merely an image , and where we separate the events of their lives from the actual human being for some good gossip ; after all , we only know the persona , not the real person , and we only know what the media reports , not the whole story . In the end we have no idea of what Britney Spears or Madonna or Brangelina are like as people , what they think , what their day to day life is like . In the movie , we know Truman's - and his whole story is false . It's said that a great comedian can do drama , and Jim Carrey is proof of this , giving a brilliant , heartfelt performance as Truman . Ed Harris is fabulous as Christoff , the puppeteer who created Truman and needs him . Such a wonderful film , it demands a second viewing .
495134	342623	103205	8.0	hot stuff TV style , before Brosnan became a movie star	A few years after his success as Remington Steele , Pierce Brosnan made this film with Jobeth Williams and Virginia Madsen . Though highly derivative , it makes for very intriguing viewing . Williams is a psychiatrist with a few personal problems of her own . She meets Brosnan and , like any red-blooded , healthy woman , falls for him . He's a professor and author , and how every female student he has isn't running after him is unclear . Madsen plays a patient of Williams ' , and she has even more issues than Williams has . One of them concerns this man she's involved with . . . whom Williams finally realizes is Brosnan . The question is , is this young woman delusional ? Is she fabricating a relationship as Brosnan claims , or is Brosnan the liar ? Williams approaches the dilemma as a woman in love and not a psychiatrist , making her your pretty typical desperate female . One would hope a professional person would behave a bit differently , but life experience shows us this isn't necessarily the case . I found this film very entertaining with some hot , sexy love scenes , and it keeps you guessing . After you think you've figured it out , it'll have a surprise for you .
494144	342623	41487	8.0	Superb	An Italian-American family is the subject of " House of Strangers , " a 1949 film starring Edward G . Robinson , Richard Conte , Susan Hayward , Luther Adler , Debra Paget , Hope Emerson , and Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . Being of Italian extraction myself , I actually thought this film was written by an Italian and was surprised to see it wasn't . It was dead on . Edward G . Robinson is Gino Monetti , who owns a bank in the ' 30s . He runs it like he's selling items out of his garage , with lousy bookkeeping , some people being charged interest up front on loans and some getting more money than they asked for . He has four sons , three of whom he treats like second-class citizens : Pietro is a guard at the bank by day and an amateur boxer by night , Joe is a teller , and Tony is a clerk . When Joe , who married a woman from a good Philadelphia family , asks for a raise he was promised , he gets a lecture from Gino about how the family lived in the back of a barber shop when Gino made $15 a week . When Pietro loses a boxing match , Gino takes the jacket off of his shoulders that says " Monetti Bank . " Gino runs his home with more rigidity than he does his bank : His wife doesn't say much , and he has mandatory Wednesday night spaghetti dinners during which he plays opera recordings such as " Il Barbiere di Siviglia " starring Lawrence Tibbett . Gino has a favored child , and that's Max , his lawyer son . When the Feds start investigating Gino , Max comes up with a solution . If all the brothers will take responsibility for the sloppiness at the bank , the Feds won't be able to pin anything on anybody . But the sons refuse to lift a finger to help their father , ultimately forcing him out and starting their own bank . Max goes to prison for attempting to bribe a juror , and when he gets out , he's bent on revenge against his brothers . The acting is this film is nothing short of fantastic . Robinson is perfect as the dictatorial , ruthless Gino . Conte is totally believable as the favorite son - efficient and slightly to the right of slimy . Luther Adler gives a brilliant performance as the henpecked Tony . The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent . Susan Hayward plays Max's love interest , a woman who gives as good as she gets . She looks sensational and does a terrific job in her role . Stardom is right around the corner for her , and it's no surprise . With a great pace kept by Joseph Mankiewicz , this is a film that I'm surprised we don't hear more about . It just goes to show that there were so many great films made in Hollywood in the past that even some marvelous ones are overlooked . " House of Strangers " is definitely one to see and remember .
494635	342623	405159	9.0	a knockout punch	I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on " Rawhide . " Who could have imagined , looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner , that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has ? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days , it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films , as the typecasting was even worse than it is today . But Clint did it . Unfortunately for me , I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater . Because of the staggered release of MDB , it was almost impossible not to . I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot . That being said , I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams , courage , and the true meaning of family . The three principals did a tremendous job . Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress . She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character . There is never anything overdone in her work . She is one of the finest actresses we have . Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have . And Clint Eastwood ? Well , he's just one of the finest directors we have . Congratulations , Rowdy .
493933	342623	39029	9.0	engrossing fare	" Three Strangers " has long been a favorite film of mine , with its fascinating reference to the statue of the goddess Kwan Yin , who , in Chinese legend , opens her eyes and grants a wish to three strangers on the Chinese New Year . Geraldine Fitzgerald , Sydney Greenstreet , and Peter Lorre are the above-mentioned strangers , each with an agenda that can be easily pursued by money . So the wish is that their sweepstakes ticket win , and the agreement is that it then be entered into the horse race that follows . Geraldine Fitzgerald's character seems sympathetic , but she reveals herself as quite obsessive and delusional as the film progresses . Greenstreet plays a crooked solicitor , and Lorre portrays a small time criminal - he's the most sympathetic character and , to my mind , gives the most memorable performance . The film asks the question - did the meeting of the three strangers change their lives , or did events proceed as they would have ? This is an unusual , absorbing , and entertaining film . I highly recommend it .
494315	342623	36855	9.0	A man tries to gaslight his wife	As Suzanne once said on " Designing Women , " " you're trying to gas stove me . " The term for driving a person crazy by either gaslighting or gas stoving them comes from this magnificent 1944 film , remade from a 1940 British production - and both come from the play " Angel Street . " But it was this Oscar-winning film that made " to gaslight " popular . It stars Charles Boyer , Ingrid Bergman , Joseph Cotten and Angela Lansbury . This " Gaslight " has some differences from the British film , in that it switches the connection to the woman murdered in the house where the Antons live from the husband ( Boyer ) to the wife ( Bergman ) , and the old detective interested in Gregory is now an attractive young detective interested in Paula ( though the names are changed here too ) . It also gives us a back story as to how the couple met . For reasons of his own ( also different in both films ) the lovely Paula's new husband , Gregroy , starts slowly driving her mad , accusing her of forgetting things , losing items , and setting her up to be frightful of going out or being social , and when she does , having hysterics so everyone knows she is disturbed . He openly flirts with the trashy maid ( Lansbury ) and embarrasses his wife in front of her . He also leaves the house every night , and as she sits in her room , the gaslight dims , as if someone has turned on another light in the house . But no one has . Paula is going nuts . But a young police detective has seen Paula and has recognized her as the relative of someone very important in his life . The acting and production values in " Gaslight " are great . Bergman has never looked more beautiful than in the gorgeous Victorian costumes . She makes Paula and very vulnerable and sympathetic young woman . Pia Lindstrom states on the DVD that her mother's performance is subtle . That's one thing it wasn't , and it's her tendency to go a tad over the top is the only thing that dates " Gaslight " as produced in another time . Many of her mannerisms have been used so often over the years that they have become stereotypes . Not to say there was anything wrong with Bergman's performance ; she was a great actress with a wonderful quality . It's just that the acting style employed in this film has changed somewhat . Boyer's Gregory is suave and cruel in an off-handed way . He speaks to Paula with a gentleness that makes his venom even more sinister . Joseph Cotten brings an attractiveness and sincerity to the detective . Angela Lansbury , 17 and in her film debut , is wonderful as the tarty Nancy , with her sullen look and low-class accent . An excellent performance . The DVD set has both versions of " Gaslight " ( there was also a TV movie starring Christopher Plummer ) and watching both of them is very enjoyable . Though some people consider the British version superior , I give the slight edge to this great 1944 classic , directed with a gentle hand by George Cukor .
493572	342623	350258	9.0	The warts and all bio of a music great	A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of " Ray , " a 2004 film also starring Kerry Washington , Regina King , Curtis Armstrong , Richard Schiff , Sharon Warren , Patrick Bachau , and many others , all giving excellent support to the film . The film has several main focuses : the first is Charles ' childhood - the drowning of his brother George which haunted him for years , the glaucoma that blinded him , and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend , don't break , don't ever be a cripple . She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles ' gift of music is discovered . The next focus is Charles ' artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer , to his arrangements of gospel music , his foray into country music , and the unique sound that became Ray Charles . The third focus is Charles ' personal life - his marriage to Bea , his many affairs , his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation . Because Charles lived a packed 74 years , there's a lot skipped . Though Charles was orphaned while in his teens , the death of his beloved mother , his rock , isn't in the film . While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs , his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered . At one point , he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it , but the jar broke . He was that down and out . Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia , which banned him , adopts " Georgia on My Mind " as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state , yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned . She probably was there , however . Also , she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her ; that marriage isn't covered . In the movie , we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12 . It would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film . What isn't skipped is his glorious music , which seems to go on constantly throughout the film , continually reinforcing his genius and artistry . Charles ' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout . Those who scoff at it as a made-for-TV movie don't give it the credit it deserves . Taylor Hackford's direction gives " Ray " a good pace , and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully . As Ray , Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part . Foxx wore prosthetics , did his own piano playing , and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role . He nails him , but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body ; a man full of denial about his addiction , hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked ; and he's in denial about his home life , thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children ( in the movie , child ) ; and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on . He demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted ; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal , he makes his own deal and leaves his job . One doesn't so much marvel at Foxx's performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera . This is an excellent biography , which , like " Walk the Line " is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist . Whether or not you're a Ray Charles fan , " Ray " is something to experience .
495172	342623	471003	10.0	Fantastic documentary	This is a brilliantly done documentary about one of film's great enigmas , Greta Garbo . For me , watching this was very personal , as I was privileged to research the biography written by Barry Paris ( who appears in this documentary ) . There are interviews with another biographer , Karen Swenson , with Garbo's friends , Sam Green , Gore Vidal , and others , a big fan , the marvelous Charles Busch , family members , John Gilbert's daughter Leatrice Fountain , Daniel Selznick , and footage of an interview with Clarence Brown . The photographs and film clips speak for themselves , for Garbo's tremendous beauty and unique acting ability . She was a totally intuitive actress . It's a pity that , as independent as she was , that she took some bad advice , and a bigger pity that she never returned to the screen after 1941 . A 1949 screen test shows her beauty untarnished , yet the producers were unable to raise money for the film they wanted to do , which devastated her . In my own research and transcription work , I have to admit I never experienced the Garbo that her friends and family describe . The woman I got to know through transcription of taped telephone conversations and various stories about her seemed neurotic , passive-aggressive , and , frankly , kind of dull . But she was so magical on screen . This is a wonderful documentary , highly recommended .
494104	342623	416320	10.0	A furtive tear	As much as I have always appreciated Woody Allen comedies , I admit to liking more the dramas where he asks the tough questions . The brilliant " Match Point , " like " Crimes and Misdemeanors " is one of those , and it's his best . Loosely based on " A Place in the Sun , " Allen's tough question is , " Would you rather be good or lucky ? " " Is there such a thing as luck ? " Many believe that people " make their own luck . " But Allen's premise is that , when it's all over , luck plays a huge part in all of our lives . He uses the analogy of a tennis ball - when you serve a ball and it lands on the net , it can topple over to the other side , and you win , or fall on the same side , and you lose . What a perfect analogy to tell the story of Chris ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) , a former professional tennis player . He becomes the tennis teacher at a British club and meets Tom Hewett , a young man from a filthy rich family . Chris is embraced by Hewett's family and begins dating Tom's sister Chloe . Then he sees Tom's fiancé , Nola , played by Scarlett Johannson , and becomes obsessed with her . This is an amazing film - absolutely nothing happens for a while , and yet everything happens . The story is punctuated with old , scratchy Caruso records and operatic selections from " Macbeth , " " Otello , " and others . We watch the characters living their lives , including their work , romantic entanglements , and marital problems . We watch them evolve , grow happy or unhappy , contented or restless , all leading up to the point where something does happen . When it does , it's ferocious . The ending will knock your socks off . It goes nowhere you think it's going . The film manages to keep you constantly off-balance and misinterpreting what you think you're seeing . The last time I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers , he was giving a marvelous portrayal of Elvis Presley , despite the fact that his height and frame are somewhat slighter than the King's . A beautiful young man , he has an interior dialogue going throughout the film . We don't hear it ; we see it on his face . Scarlet Johannson is gorgeous and sexy as Nola , a cool blond in the Lana Turner tradition who is the object of his desire . Of all the characters in the film , her character goes through the most change , and she's very effective . There are no easy answers to the questions Allen asks in " Crimes and Misdemeanors , " " Stardust Memories , " " Bullets over Broadway , " and " Match Point . " Allen leaves open what will happen emotionally as a result of the events of this film . But the verse of " Una Furtiva Lagrima , " ( A secret tear ) played several times during the film despite a bad skip in the recording means " For just one moment the beating Of her hot pulse could be felt ! With her sighing confounding Momentarily my sighs ! Oh God , I shall expire ; I can't ask for more . " Significantly , it is heard at the beginning of the film and at the end . Just remember - the record skips .
493580	342623	43014	10.0	The ultimate has-been in the ultimate Hollywood story	William Holden is Joe Gillis , a down and out screenwriter trying to keep his car from being repossessed in " Sunset Boulevard , " a 1950 film written and directed by Billy Wilder . The film stars Gloria Swanson , Max von Stroheim , Nancy Olson , Jack Webb , and Cecil B . Demille . Gillis hides his car in a garage , not realizing it is the home of the great silent film star , the delusional Norma Desmond ( Swanson ) , who lives in this enormous mansion , cared for by her butler ( von Stroheim ) . Finding out he is a screenwriter , Norma solicits his help in editing her script of " Salome , " her comeback film . Feeling somewhat trapped at first , Joe eventually enjoys the good life . When he slips away to be with his friends on New Year's Eve , his friend's fiancée , Betty Schaefer ( Olson ) suggests a screenplay based on a story written by Joe . ( The story actually was a script by Wilder , filmed in Germany . ) He returns to the Sunset Boulevard mansion to learn that Norma , distraught over his leaving , has attempted suicide . Taking pity on her , Joe becomes her lover and moves from the garage into the big house . Meanwhile , he's falling for Betty and slipping away to work with her at night . This is perhaps the greatest Hollywood story , and yet it didn't get off to a very good start . The first scene took place in a morgue , where the dead bodies talked to one another . At the first screening , the audience laughed , which they weren't supposed to be doing . As Wilder sat on the steps outside , a woman walked out and , unaware of who he was , said , " Have you ever seen such ? x @ / / & ? " " And we had worked on it for a year , " Wilder told an interviewer . So the opening was cut . Wilder captures the ego and delusional aspects of Desmond perfectly , a woman caught in the past who has lost all sense of reality . This role provided silent film star Gloria Swanson with her great comeback . With her royal demeanor , sharp voice and gorgeous eyes , Swanson actually plays the role like a silent star , in a very overt way . The truth is , Norma never left not only her stardom , but her film roles . At the time of the filming , Swanson was 52 playing a has-been of 50 . By today's standards , it's somewhat amusing , and you'd probably add 20 years if you were doing it today . In fact , in the Broadway show , the line " There's nothing wrong with being 50 " was cut . Wilder approached Mae West , Pola Negri and Mary Pickford for Norma before Swanson . " Sunset Boulevard " may have given Swanson her comeback , but it made William Holden a superstar . After his starring role in " Golden Boy , " Holden disappeared into light films and basically went nowhere until Joe Gillis . He is remembered today as one of the great stars of the ' 50s , yet he was of the same generation as many of the stars of the ' 30s and ' 40s . He is glorious looking - you wouldn't have to be a loony tune to lock him up in your house . He plays the role with the right touch of cynicism and self-hatred . Montgomery Clift was set to play this role but dropped out . He , too , would have been excellent but probably not as hard-hitting . von Stroheim , as Norma's protector and butler Max , is perfection . In real life , he couldn't drive , so the car needed to be towed ; in the scene where he drives up to Paramount , he actually crashed through the gates . In the film , Norma , thinking that Demille wants her for a role , goes to Paramount and visits him on the set of " Samson and Delilah , " and " Sunset Boulevard " uses the real filming of that movie and its cast . As a Broadway show , " Sunset Boulevard " was opulent but much less effective . There wasn't enough music ( the second act had one new song ) but provided a tremendous showcase and two great numbers for the various women who played Norma . Stephen Sondheim had at one time entertained doing this as a musical ; in his hands , it would have captured the dark atmosphere of the film much better . Billy Wilder gives us a biting portrait of actors who live for nothing but their stardom , their hangers-on for whom they are just a meal ticket , and the sadness of being aged and forgotten in Hollywood . A great classic starring the greats , written and directed by one . It doesn't get any better than this .
494620	342623	60665	10.0	The phenomenal Paul Scofield	Paul Scofield is Sir Thomas More , " A Man for All Seasons , " in a 1966 film directed by Fred Zinnemann and also starring Robert Shaw , Orson Welles , John Hurt , Leo McKern , Wendy Hiller , and Susanna York . Vanessa Redgrave , who was to play York's role , did a play instead and agreed to do the non-speaking role of Anne Boleyn , provided she not be given billing in the ads for the movie . The story concerns Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine , is brother's widow , and his desire to marry Anne Boleyn so that she can give him an heir . Great pressure is put on More , a well-respected lawyer , to support the King , but More will not . He instead chooses to be silent on the matter , even when the King pronounces himself the head of the Church of England . If More speaks out , he will be charged with treason ; by keeping silent , the King has no case against him . Nevertheless , a number of people work on More from all angles to get him to sign an oath to the King , but he will not . Finally , the King's cohorts realize that perjury is the only avenue left open to them in order to secure a charge of treason against More and have him executed . Really , there's not much to be said about this profound film about a man who , to the death , had a commitment to his beliefs and never faltered . Paul Scofield is not as famous to vast audiences as Sir Laurence Olivier , Richard Burton , Sir Anthony Hopkins , and a whole host of excellent British actors who have made contributions to film . Scofield has made 30 movies , each chosen by him carefully . If he cared about money , he could gone slumming as a few of his counterparts did ; with his magnificent voice and imposing presence , he could have done a Grey Poupon or a Polaroid commercial . But as a true artist and not an actor looking for production money , money to support a theater , or , like Burton , unable to recover from an impoverished childhood , his film work is not geared toward superstardom or prolific work . In every role he plays , from the obsessed Nazi in " The Train , " to van Doren Sr . in " Quiz Show , " he is magnificent . But Sir Thomas More is his greatest role . It was turned down by Richard Burton , who would have been excellent but perhaps given us a more showy performance . Scofield's Sir Thomas More is a man humble before God , his true leader . He believes that no man is above the law , and that no man is above God . He is an unusual person in this world - he stands up for what he believes in no matter the cost . We seem to love these characters in films and books - More , Atticus Finch , Terry Malloy , and yet in the world outside of film , there are fewer and fewer exhibitions of such character . The rest of the cast is uniformly great , including Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey ; Leo McKern , so beloved as Rumpole of the Bailey , is here the horrid Thomas Cromwell , who will stop at nothing to make More bend his way ; John Hurt as the slimy Richard Rich ; Wendy Hiller as More's suffering wife ; and Susannah York as his beloved daughter Margaret . It's sometimes forgotten that Henry VIII was once a young , athletic , and very attractive man - I was reminded of it just last summer when I saw an absolute hunk play the young Henry . The arrogant , flirtatious , handsome man playing Henry in " A Man for All Seasons " looked familiar , but I couldn't place him . Having only seen the Robert Shaw of " The Sting " and " Jaws , " it was hard to believe that he had ever looked or sounded the way he did in this film . He gives a marvelous , fiery performance . The cinematography and scenery in this film is stunning , and there are many outside scenes - the sunlight in Thomas More's eyes as the King comes into view , the hustle and bustle of the town , the darkness of More's cell juxtaposed with the bright outdoors - all important parts of the story . The last half hour is hard to take for the viewer , but it is some of the most beautiful work ever in film . More's final moments are magnificent and to be treasured . A must-see for the story of a great man , and for one of the top performances of all time .
495142	342623	101669	10.0	Fabulous	Not much else to say after my one-line summary about this wild ride brought to us by the man who , in 1991 at least , promised to be the next Orson Welles . And don't tell me he wasn't doing more than a touch of Olivier in _ Rebecca ( 1940 ) _ qv in his black and white scenes - Branagh's sense of humor is just one of the joys of this totally surprising , enthralling , suspenseful and fun film . I have read some of the other comments and it's a shame that so many have lost their taste for good old-fashioned entertainment , which this surely is . Not only is the cast top-notch and the acting great , but the film combines mystery , karma and film noir which , Hitchcock fan that I am , kept me GLUED to the set . _ Dead Again ( 1991 ) _ qv is one of the few films that I own and could watch over and over . To all the nay-sayers of this film , Sixth Sense , Usual Suspects , etc . etc . , I say - let me see you do it better . Go right ahead .
495192	342623	36983	10.0	A great , inspirational film	Gregory Peck plays Father Francis Chisholm , who has been given " The Keys to the Kingdom " in this sweeping 1944 film based on the famous novel by A . J . Cronin . Also starring are Thomas Mitchell , Edmund Gwenn , Sir Cedric Hardwicke , Vincent Price , Rosa Stradner and Roddy McDowell . The story is told in flashback as a monsignor ( Hardwicke ) reads Chisholm's journal of his 40 years as a missionary in China . Like most men who made films for 20th Century Fox that span a long period of time , Peck's character as a young man is played by Roddy McDowell . The journal tells of his parents ' death and the love he has for the girl he grew up with , Nora , which keeps him from the vocation his aunt wants for him . Francis does , however , embrace the priesthood and is sent to China to start a mission . His live and let live philosophy is at odds with what the Church hierarchy wants - he doesn't rub elbows with the wealthy Chinese , whose conversion would bring in the peasants and whose generosity would help build his mission . He knows their conversions would be in name only ; and he wants nothing to do with " rice Christians " who become Christians for food . Instead , he sets out to do God's work and blessings flow to him , and a wonderful mission , church and school are built . When a difficult nun ( Stradner ) arrives , Francis treats her with dignity and patience and eventually wins her loyalty and friendship . When revolution threatens the mission , Father Chisholm participates in bringing down the enemy . In short , he does what he knows to be true to himself , to his belief in God , and in the interests of his people . This is a truly magnificent film . As it went on , I asked myself , with varying things going on in the story but not a lot of big action scenes , what keeps the audience interested in such a movie . Characterizations . Real people . Relationships . Honesty regarding the human experience . You can find these elements in many films today , but don't look for those films to be released by the monolith studios , one of which released " The Keys to the Kingdom . " Those films have 15-second scenes , huge special effects and characters scripted in shorthand . It takes a film like this to truly make one appreciate what Hollywood has lost . See this and then watch " Poseidon . " It will have you running to TCM and Fox Movie Channel faster than anything else . Gregory Peck can best be described by the book " Growing up Catholic , " in which there's a chapter called " Father What-a-Waste " where the authors lament the good-looking parish priest . Tall and handsome , Peck is totally believable as a good , gentle and determined man who follows Christ . There's a difference between playing a role and being the role - Peck IS Father Chisholm . Vincent Price is good as Francis ' arrogant friend Angus , and Thomas Mitchell is terrific as an atheist doctor who is nevertheless Francis ' best friend . Hardwicke brings great dignity to his role , and his voice as narrator is wonderful ; and Edmund Gwenn , as Francis ' mentor , is perfectly cast . Rosa Stradler plays the difficult nun , Maria-Veronique , an upper class woman who looks with disdain not only on Father Chisholm but the Chinese . The interesting thing about her performance is that at the end , as she plays the aging nun , she takes on the mannerisms and voice of an older woman . She's marvelous . This would be my only criticism of Peck - while his character looks old , Peck still speaks and moves as a younger man . One of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood . Not sappy , not sentimental , just very powerful in its demonstration of what true goodness can achieve .
494237	342623	63227	10.0	Kind of a Medieval " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf "	Peter O'Toole is Henry II , a true " Lion in Winter " in this 1968 film version of the play by James Goldman and also starring Katharine Hepburn , Anthony Hopkins , Timothy Dalton , Nigel Terry , Jane Merrow and John Castle . On Broadway , the roles of Henry and Eleanor were played by Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris . The casting director for the Broadway production commented that the original auditions , before Preston and Harris injected the spice and humor into the dialogue , were heavy going , the delivery of the actors very , very serious . Imagine this movie with no spark , no sarcasm , no wry humor injected into the lines , and you've got yourself a real nightmare . Fortunately , it's not the case . Though the story takes dramatic license with the truth - for instance , there was no Christmas gathering of the actual family in 1183 , but there was in 1182 - the depiction of the family's infighting , considering how everything turned out , is probably quite correct . King Henry II wants to name his successor and brings his family together . This includes his imprisoned wife , Eleanor of Quitaine ( Hepburn ) , his mistress , Princess Alais ( Merrow ) , and his three sons - Richard ( Hopkins ) , Geoffrey ( Castle ) and John ( Terry ) , and Alais ' brother , King Philip of France ( Dalton ) . Everybody makes deals they don't intend to make good , promises they don't plan to keep , and alliances they don't want in order to secure the throne either , in the sons ' cases , for themselves , or in Eleanor and Henry's cases , for someone else . To say that Henry and Eleanor have a volatile relationship is a tremendous understatement , and the dialogue is an incredible roller-coaster ride that's never boring . One wonders if an audience would sit through such a film today . If not , it's a pity , because it's so brilliant . Watching O'Toole and Hepburn sparring - sometimes so cruelly and bitterly that it's devastating - is addictive . You can't turn away from it . Hepburn shows us immediately by subtle actions - a quick expression that's just as quickly covered up , a slight hesitation in movement or speech - that no matter what her words say , she worships Henry still . For Henry , she is the most challenging and exciting woman he has ever known - and because of the volatility of their relationship , they can't survive together . Talk about being able to push each other's buttons - with Henry , it's whether or not Eleanor slept with his father ; with Eleanor , it's his desire to marry Alais and divorce her . O'Toole takes the title of the film literally , and he indeed roars like an old lion . A powerful and overt actor , Henry II , which he played twice , is one of his greatest roles and this performance perhaps his best . Handsome , sexy , angry and wild , he holds the screen magnificently . For me this is Hepburn's best role . Her Eleanor is beautiful , dignified , sensitive and determined , easily wounded by Henry , though she tries not to show it . Henry II lived another 6 years , during which time Eleanor remained imprisoned by him , although she enjoyed more freedom and actually occasionally traveled with Henry . Henry was succeeded by Richard and then , because Richard had no heirs , by John . Eleanor spent her last years as a nun and , no surprise , outlived all of her children except for King John and Queen Leonora . Both Henry and Eleanor will live forever in " The Lion in Winter . " Imagine a movie with such superstars that Anthony Hopkins has a supporting role - thus was the case in 1968 when the young Hopkins played Richard , a closet homosexual who has had an affair with Philip of France . ( " Oh , Richard , " Eleanor says as she sends him to make a deal with Philip , " promise him ANYTHING . " ) History is quite divided over whether or not Richard was actually gay , but some writings definitely indicate that he was . Hopkins is brilliant as a tough and even cruel man who has a very sensitive side that can be gotten to by his mother . The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent . One of the greatest scripts with one of the greatest casts of all time
