494474	342623	373450	4.0	A journalist tries to find out the truth behind an old murder	Alison Lohman is a young journalist trying to find out " Where the Truth Lies " in this 2005 film starring Kevin Bacon , Colin Firth and Maury Chaykin . Bacon and Firth are a kind of Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis team , and a dead girl is found in one of their hotel suites . Karen ( Lohman ) is to assist part of the act , Vince ( Firth ) in writing his memoirs years later . She has a hidden agenda , which is to learn how Maureen Flaherty , a maid in a Las Vegas hotel , was found dead in a New Jersey hotel suite all those years ago . As a film , this left me pretty cold ; indeed , everything about it is cold , including some very good performances from Bacon and Firth . Nothing warmed up the camera , though . Alison Lohman was so bad she was laughable . I had very little interest in whodunit or why because I didn't care about anyone . There's lots of sex , nudity and drug-taking , and I frankly didn't realize this was a controversial part of the film . I agree that an R rating would have been fine . I'm sure the guys loved it . I'm always amazed that when a film is this bad , how people go out of their way to declare it a master of film-making . Where the Truth Lies reminded me of Leaving Las Vegas - terrible .
494631	342623	427575	4.0	on the dull side	This entry into Hallmark's rotating mystery series is fairly dull . One wonders where that extremely high rating - and no comments - comes from . Mystery Woman lacks the colorfulness of the McBride series . Kellie Martin is darling , but this show dragged . It's always great to see old-timer Clarence Williams III . However , he is so laid back in this , he makes the late Perry Como seem manic . The lack of energy is probably due to the poor direction . One more establishing shot of the " Mystery Woman Bookstore " and I was ready to do an Elvis and shoot the television . The whole thing was done in a very pedantic style .
493699	342623	36810	4.0	just okay entry into The Falcon series	This is the tenth of the Falcon series , starring Tom Conway who took the role over from his brother , George Sanders . Both men are debonair and have similar speaking voices , but I've always found Sanders the smoother of the two and enjoyed his Falcon more . In this one , the Falcon goes on vacation in Hollywood and gets embroiled in a murder in a movie studio . Veda Ann Borg is the Falcon's self-assigned partner and is one of those stereotypical , wise-cracking ' 40s dames . She livens things up , though . Barbara Hale , who later became the Della Street of my youth , plays an actress . It's all pretty routine , with a mini-von Sternberg type director , a producer who keeps quoting Shakespeare and is superstitious , and a mysterious " Indian " character who may or may not be involved with a ruby ring found on the dead man . A pleasant enough way to pass the time .
493738	342623	1109616	5.0	A deeply disturbed mother tries to stop her daughter from having a life	The leggy eldest daughter on " The Nanny , " Nicholle Tom , is all grown up now and " Her Only Child " in this 2008 film also starring Cameron Daddo and Gwynyth Walsh . Tom plays Lily Stanler , unlucky in love , who lives with her suffocating wreck of a mother ( Walsh ) who is terrified of bugs and of her daughter leaving her . She's the type of mom who makes cookies when her daughter is on a diet and wants to see a movie on Saturday night when she knows her daughter has a date that evening . When Lily meets the handsome Larry ( Daddo ) , mom has a knife injury requiring stitches in the middle of one date , and during Lily's romantic weekend with Larry , her dog gets into the garbage back home and is possibly poisoned ( I was nervous about Binky all during the movie ) . Add to that the fact that Lily's past relationships have ended somewhat suddenly , Mom always being there to pick up the pieces takes on new meaning - mom's the one creating the breakage to begin with . Does Lily need a sledgehammer over her head before she figures this out ? Or does Binky or her new beau have to die before she gets a clue ? Tune in and find out ! Walsh is so obviously a whacko that it's impossible to believe her daughter would think she was even semi-normal . Still you can't help but feel sorry for the manipulated Lily character - the beautiful Tom has a sweet presence , and you just want to throttle her to get a life . Daddo , of " F / X " fame is hunky as ever . Very ordinary , very typical Lifetime movie . Lifetime rotates the same three or four plots and changes the cast - and we keep watching . Now who's crazy ?
493499	342623	35309	5.0	odd little film	" Seven Sweethearts " is about a journalist who travels to Holland , Michigan to do a story about tulip time there and falls in love . The owner of the hotel has seven young , lovely daughters , all with men's names , who live in an isolated little world of clogs and tulips . One of them is pretty Billie ( Kathryn Grayson ) with whom the jaded reporter falls in love . All the girls , with the exception of the ambitious , cold Reggie ( Marsha Hunt ) have boyfriends and are aching to get married . But tradition states that the oldest girl must marry first . This movie seemed very long to me , strange , and somewhat boring . It's filled with B actors , with the exception of Heflin , Grayson , and character actor S . K . Sakall , who hands in one of the best acting scenes toward the end of the film when he has a confrontation with Billie . Grayson had a thin , fluttery coloratura soprano that nevertheless possessed some beautiful high notes and pianissimos , and she entertains throughout with songs and arias such as " Je suis Titania . " She's good in her role . Heflin seems out of place but is quite likable . For those who don't know , the oldest girl marrying first was and perhaps still is a tradition in many cultures . The ending is cute , but this is still a cloying film , and it's hard to believe that this family had no relatives in Holland that they were concerned about during wartime . I suppose the idea was to take everyone out of the war for a while .
494650	342623	52325	5.0	Unusual casting in a strange comedy	1958 was before Ross Hunter embarked Doris Day on the fabulous career she had in the ' 60s , in which she would become a top box office draw - in fact , THE box office drawer for years . In " The Tunnel of Love , " she plays a sweet , vivacious woman who is desperate to have a baby and can't , so she and her husband , played by Richard Widmark , plan to adopt one . When the adopted baby bears a strong resemblance to Widmark , he becomes sure that the child is the result of an evening he can't remember with the investigative social worker ( Gia Scala ) . Based on a play , this kind of light , subtly sexual comedy became very popular on the dinner theater circuit in the ' 60s and ' 70s , joining the ranks of " Mary , Mary " , " The Marriage Go Round , " " Boeing Boeing , " etc . It is not particularly well directed by Gene Kelly and sports the very strange casting of Richard Widmark as Day's confused husband . I can't agree with the comments here . Though an actor known for playing tough roles and cruel men , he does a credible job here mainly because he knows enough not to play for laughs . He creates a full character , that of a caring if foolish man who adores his wife but screws up occasionally . Gig Young plays the philandering husband next door . He's fine , but the character is very unlikable . There's not really much to recommend here . I suppose at the time it was considered somewhat suggestive , but it doesn't play well today .
493952	342623	386676	5.0	I have a feeling the British version is better . . . much better	I probably should give this show more of a chance , but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it , I probably won't watch it again . Most of the time , British comedies , when taken over by Americans , don't seem to make it . " Fawlty Towers , " which lasted all of five minutes , comes to mind . This appears to be one of them . There were some very funny moments , and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version . The boss , plain and simple , is a complete moron . Totally out of it , he thinks he's a role model and hilariously funny , when all the while he's a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks , does Three Stooges impressions , and is emotionally abusive ( firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears ) . It's a great setup for a fabulous character , but I found him only annoying . I'm afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp's : embarrassed , appalled , and not finding much funny .
494182	342623	823477	6.0	Nature versus nurture	In " Jane Doe : The Ties That Bind , " Cathy's son is doing a piece for school on " nature versus nurture . " In Jane Doe's case ( that's Cathy's alias when she works for the government ) the question of nature versus nurture is an underlying theme . She embarks on a case with Frank Darnell ( Joe Penny ) involving a man being in two places at the same time . We know what's coming . When that comes , and there's still 45 minutes to go , we know what's coming next . Lea Thompson stars as Jane Doe . This particular story is preposterous , though I've spent my time doing worse . Thompson is likable . The best thing in the series is Joe Penny by a mile . The worst thing about this series , by a mile , are scenes depicting Cathy's home life , which are great if you're trying to go to sleep . The family part is the major problem with this series and drags the rest of it down to an even lower level . The episode this week dealt with the older daughter getting permission to stay out all night . The script for these scenes was a total mess . Cathy ( Jane Doe ) tells her husband ( Billy Moses ) to have the daughter text every half hour . This is never mentioned again , but before the daughter leaves , she begs her father not to call her every half hour . He doesn't tell her to text . Later on we learn he's calling her every half hour . Then Jane Doe is concerned back in her office because her daughter hasn't called . No mention was ever made of her daughter calling her . Nobody in the show can get their cell phone to work - they're always conveniently out of range whenever the plot needs them to be . At the end of the show , the son gives his speech on nature versus nurture - which is not the speech he was practicing in his room . The " Jane Doe " series has some action to it - and it has Penny - and a pleasant , if not fiery actress in Thompson . With some attention to the scripts , this show could be much better . The family is too perfect , the scenes are too ordinary , and they move too slowly . The music is horrific . The rest of the show is always more interesting , and some of the mysteries have been pretty good . Mildly entertaining .
494476	342623	34961	6.0	Marlene Dietrich in a comedy	Marlene Dietrich is the lady in " The Lady is Willing , " a 1942 film also starring Fred MacMurray and Arline Judge . The beautiful Dietrich plays a musical star , Liza Madden , who walks off with an abandoned baby and takes him home . Though Liza lives well , she owes a fortune to the IRS and gives all of her money away , and she won't be able to adopt the child unless she's either married or solvent . She convinces a pediatrician ( MacMurray ) to marry her . He does , and they adopt the baby , now called Corey . The marriage is supposed to be in name only , but you know how those things go . " The Lady is Willing " is not much of a story or a movie , but Dietrich is just stunning , and her acting is charming . She creates a very lovable character . MacMurray , as the doctor who falls in love with her , turns in a good performance . He's part of a dumb subplot involving rabbits that is dropped along the way . Dietrich's assistant is played by Arline Judge and her maid by Marietta Canty and they are both excellent in their roles . It's just too bad all of these good people had to be in this particular story . Obviously , the baby in question ( David James ) is unaware that the story is weak ; he laughs and plays with telephone cords , Dietrich's hats and smiles at everyone . Just adorable . Definitely worth it for Dietrich and her fashions , and if you like kids , little Corey . Interestingly , one of Dietrich's famous legs was in a cast for part of the film , though it's not noticeable .
494865	342623	39325	6.0	Noir based on the radio show	" Mr . District Attorney " is a 1947 film starring Dennis O'Keefe , Michael O'Shea , Marguerite Chapman and Adolphe Menjou . It has a solid B cast that includes Jeff Donnell and George Coulouris . O'Keefe plays Steve Bennett , a defense attorney who is offered a job in the DA's office by Craig Warren ( Menjou ) and accepts . Unfortunately he's being played by the Chapman character , Marcia Manning , who's trying to get information from him that will help the case of her boyfriend , James Randolph ( Coulouris ) . By listening in on a phone conversation , she finds out about a witness , who suddenly disappears . Warren suspects Manning , who has a police record , so he sends Steve to Italy to find a witness and convinces Marcia to get out of his life . She does so , by marrying Randolph . When Steve returns and finds his girlfriend married , he blames Warren and quits the DA's office , making him ripe for exploitation by Randolph yet again . This is an okay film , brightened by the performance of Michael O'Shea as an investigator who works in the DA's office . Menjou is very good as the DA . O'Keefe is a likable and attractive actor who doesn't register much here . Chapman is effective . I mainly know who she is from the ' 80s , where she was selling her own memorabilia and always had an ad in " Hollywood Studio Magazine . " The movie felt a little dragged out .
493760	342623	167752	6.0	Odd . I find it odd .	I was confused from the beginning of " The 4th Floor " because , fool that I am , it never once occurred to me that this young woman talking with William Hurt ( who is my age ) was actually his girlfriend . She looked like his daughter and in fact , with the 23 year difference in their ages , could have been . Once that was out of the way , I started to concentrate . This is a pretty scary movie if you like the genre , but it doesn't make any sense . I can understand Jane moving into her late aunt's apartment - it's New York City , after all , reasonably priced apartments are hard to come by , and she doesn't want to move in with her boyfriend . But no matter how reasonable the rent , no one would have stayed in that building . The neighbors are all totally bizarre and someone - she thinks it's her neighbor on the 4th floor - - is tormenting her . Aggressively . There are sometimes one can put these problems in a film aside and sometimes that one can't . This would be one of the times that one can't . It really stretched all reason . If it was the type of film where one just had to suspend belief , that would have been another story , but it wasn't . I figured the plot out long before the denouement , although the ending is ambiguous in a way . The acting was mixed . Lewis sounded like she was imitating Jennifer Elise Cox's character on Lovespring , and Hurt's role was beneath him . The supporting players were the marvelous Austin Pendleton and Shelley Duvall who gave wonderful and interesting performances . All in all , scary stuff , good atmosphere , an okay rental .
494507	342623	22268	6.0	Star-making film despite miscasting	Jean Harlow is the " Platinum Blonde " a reporter falls for in this 1931 film , directed by Frank Capra and also starring Loretta Young and Robert Williams . The gorgeous 18-year-old Young plays a reporter who hangs with the guys - I think NOT , though she acquits herself well . The story concerns a reporter , Stew Smith ( Williams ) who goes out to the mansion of the prominent Schuyler family to get a story - the son in the family wrote letters to a chorus girl , and she wants $10 , 000 for them . Smith falls for the society daughter and they wind up eloping . I naturally thought Jean Harlow would be the chorus girl . Instead , she's the rich woman Stew Smith falls for , Anne Schuyler ! Harlow makes a couple of attempts at sounding sophisticated , something she did in her later films when she was making fun of someone . Doing it here , she can't keep it up . Nevertheless , she's good in this serious role and has wonderful chemistry with Williams . This film really launched both her and Capra . The supporting cast is wonderful . It's pre-code , and there's a very sexy scene between Williams and Harlow as they stand kissing behind glass as a water fountain flows over the glass . A beautiful shot . Like everyone else , I was impressed with Williams ' performance and wondered what happened to him . He died of appendicitis complications right after the film's release . He was tremendously talented and just wonderful as Stew . This is the typical class distinction story so common in theater and films back then . Except for the casting , there aren't really any surprises . If you have a chance to see it , do , for the stars and especially for Robert Williams .
494746	342623	29675	6.0	Cary Grant was second-billed !	It's rare to see the iconic Cary Grant get second billing , but in 1937 , he did , under Edward Arnold in " The Toast of New York . " This is the purported story of financial schemer Jim Fisk ( Arnold ) , who , in the 1800s , tried to corner the gold market , oversold stock to his railroad company , and fled to New Jersey , continuing to print convertible bonds where no one could get him . The film takes a lot of liberties with the truth but it leaves no doubt that Fisk was a real character , beautifully portrayed by the talented , energetic Arnold . Grant plays his co-conspirator who also loves Fisk's discovery , Josie Mansfield ( Frances Farmer ) . Fisk is madly in love with her and wants to make her a big star . I have to say the movie dragged for me , and I didn't find it particularly interesting . The point of interest in it today , I guess , would be the presence of Frances Farmer , whose fascinating story was made into " Frances " starring Jessica Lange ( and wow , the resemblance is incredible ) . Farmer was very beautiful with a deep voice that didn't really match her looks . The fact that her life story made her better known than her film career ever could have shouldn't be confused with acting ability , which wasn't that great on film . She was probably much more effective on stage . She doesn't register much here - in fact , the only ones who do are Arnold and Donald Meek . Handsome Grant doesn't have much to do - seen today , that's disconcerting . Viewers are used to him being the whole show . Overall , a disappointment , though Arnold was a strong actor who usually did supporting roles . This is a rare lead for him , and he's more than up to the task .
494478	342623	818120	6.0	Better than some	Let's face it : " Mystery Woman " " McBride " and " Jane Doe " are about as bad as you can get . They have no pacing and most of the time suffer from poor direction and bad scripts . What these series have going for them are attractive leads , sometimes okay mysteries , and if you have an elderly relative at home who is affronted by just about everything else on television , the Hallmark Channel is perfect for them . " Mystery Woman " stars Kellie Martin as the owner of a mystery bookstore with no customers . We know it's a mystery store because there's an establishing shot of it every two minutes . Obviously , these shows run short - there are lots of scenes where we see a car from way off driving down the street , into a driveway . . . endless . In this episode , Sam winds up taking care of a fugitive's wife and baby though at first , she thinks the woman is just a family friend . The woman's husband is sought in a murder that took place on a golf course - he was seen bending over the body . There are people after him and they're not all police . At one point , he's shot and his wife leaves Sam with the baby and goes to his motel to take care of him . Sam's investigation uncovers an FBI case and blackmail . It's hard not to like Kellie Martin as both an actress and an individual . I love her , and she's good as Samantha . She doesn't have a lot to work with , yet she always manages to give a charming performance . As her best friend and the DA , Nina Siemaszko does well with an impossible role . Clarence Williams III , as the mysterious Philby , is certainly mysterious - it's a mystery how he was cast . Dead man barely talking . Okay if there's nothing else on television .
493677	342623	36092	6.0	On the other side of Brokeback Mountain	Jean Arthur meets cowboy John Wayne in the 1943 comedy , " A Lady Takes a Chance . " Arthur is Molly , a woman with plenty of suitors , though none is a prize , who takes a cross-country bus tour - conducted by Phil Silvers . While watching a rodeo , one of the riders falls on top of her . Turns out it's a fella named Duke ( John Wayne ) . You can just see those pathetic guys at home flash before her eyes as she pulls Wayne toward her for a closer look . She misses her bus . Given the current talk and late-night comic jokes about " Brokeback Mountain , " this movie is extra fun . Wayne has no intention of marrying , though he loves to play the field , and accuses his rodeo partner Waco ( Charles Winninger ) of acting like " a wife . " When Waco advises Molly to go back where she came from and forget about Duke , he sounds like a wife trying to get rid of a mistress , though he really wants to keep her from being hurt . But though Duke does a lot of flirting , Molly learns during a night in the desert that her big competition is Sammy , Duke's horse . Jean Arthur is slightly miscast as Molly , though she was too wonderful an actress to ever come off as totally miscast . Someone like Betty Grable would have been more of a natural for the role than 40 + Arthur , but then , Arthur's talent helps her make the part her own and interesting besides . Her best scene is in the bar when she drinks cactus milk - hilarious . 27 years after his death , John Wayne is still considered one of the top 10 most popular stars , and with good reason . Tall , handsome , and rugged with a boyish smile , you can see why he'd make Arthur's heart go aflutter . He's usually not listed among favorite matinée idols because he made so many westerns , but make no mistake , Wayne was a hunk in his heyday . This isn't your 21st century cowboy movie , but it makes for entertaining viewing just the same .
494565	342623	161514	6.0	From a prolific novelist of teen books	Even though this apparently is not a movie produced by Lifetime , it has Lifetime written all over it . It's based on a Lurlene McDaniel story of two teenagers in love , but the young man has cancer . McDaniel has written many novels for teens , often with a spiritual theme . I can really see this film appealing to a young crowd , as it was intended . It's very sports-oriented - the boy , Luke , is the star quarterback at the high school . Beth Broderick plays the girl's mom , and she's always good , conveying an attorney's sophistication and later , compassion and support . Adrienne Barbeau is Luke's mom . The story is poignant and also predictable . There really isn't anything exceptional about it , except Barbeau's problems with her employer . Given all that , I cried like a baby and hated myself .
495028	342623	117007	6.0	Delta on a roll	A revenge on all those who wronged me films , this one starring the wonderful Delta Burke . I doubt anyone involved took this movie very seriously . Delta is totally over the top , intentionally , I think , as a woman who goes nuts after a hysterectomy is performed to save her life . Her husband and best friend were part of the decision to do the surgery . Tracy , the main character , goes after everyone involved , her husband , the friend , the doctor , the doctor's husband , determined to destroy them . It's a long list . The phrase " I wouldn't want to run into her in a dark alley " does not apply here . You don't want to run into this woman while she's in a car , a field , a building , your office , her house , your house - no place . There is an especially funny scene where Tracy , eye makeup smeared , watches her doctor on television . You can just see the madness in her eyes . Delta Burke wears her own designs for plus-size women in the film , and she looks great . She has an Elizabeth Taylor face - to me , she always exudes beauty . She plays this role for all its worth . It's right on the edge of camp - actually , maybe it slid to the other side .
494993	342623	48291	6.0	Bogie as a missionary in China	Humphrey Bogart experiences " The Left Hand of God " in this 1955 film also starring Gene Tierney , Lee J . Cobb , Agnes Moorhead and Lee J . Cobb . Bogart is Father O'Shea , who arrives at a mission in China to take over religious duties . The casting of Bogart should tell you something right away . While there , he wins the hearts of the people and that of a beautiful nurse ( Tierney ) who is a widow and , being a strong Catholic , finds her emotions unsettling . Father O has a relationship with a Chinese warlord , and now the village seems in danger . Can he save it ? There's not a tremendous amount of action in this film , but the wonderful cast keeps us interested . Always a surprising actor , Bogart has a way with touching moments , such as receiving a blessing from the oldest man in the village . In 1955 , Gene Tierney was still a young and beautiful woman , but for some reason , around 1950 , she adopted a short , matronly haircut that I for one never found flattering . She's lovely in this as a lonely widow . Moorhead and Marshall give strong performances as the doctor and his wife . Lee J . Cobb is good , but seen today , his Chinese makeup is distracting . Mildly interesting .
494038	342623	21493	6.0	Early talkie	" The Truth About Youth " is a 1930 film of special interest because of two of its young stars , Loretta Young and Myrna Loy . The story concerns a housekeeper's daughter Phyllis ( Young ) who is engaged to the young man of the house , " The Imp " ( David Manners ) . He has just turned 21 and has been raised by a triumvirate of guardians , chiefly Richard ( Conway Tearle ) . " The Imp " ( whose real name is Richard ) falls madly in lust with a man trap called Kara , who performs at a club and is known as " The Firefly . " He writes her a passionate letter and when Phyllis finds it , the elder Richard claims it's his . Because this is an early talkie , the film comes off as rather wooden . Both Loy and Young are gorgeous , Loy as a vamp and Young as a sweet young thing . Both had those short hairdos with the tight wave so popular back then . Loy has the better role as a money-grubber , and she's great . The gown she wears in performance is a knockout - an actress could wear it to the Oscars today . The men are just okay , with the exception of two of the guardians , J . Farrell McDonald and Harry Stubbs , who provide some humor . Before she became Nora Charles , Loy was cast as a vamp , usually an exotic one , until a producer who knew her personally decided to mine her humor . " The Truth About Youth " is an excellent chance to see her in an early role .
494818	342623	285293	6.0	truly frightening	This is the true story of Sante Kimes and her son , Kenny Kimes , focusing specifically on their murder of wealthy New Yorker Irene Silverman , whose body has never been found . I have seen other material done on this nut job team , and it is a fascinating study of complete psychopaths . Mary Tyler Moore is a wonderful actress , and she portrays Sante in a very over the top manner - much the way the real Sante probably is , I would imagine , to have charmed people ( men especially ) and pulled off the scams she did . She is , however , way too old for the part , only because she has to portray Sante as a younger woman . Sante at the time of the Silverman murder was 64 ; Mary Tyler Moore in this film was 67 , so big deal . The problem comes in with the earlier years . Other than that , I thought the performances were excellent from the three stars . Though Kimes & son were eventually captured for Silverman's murder , their saga did not end there . Once in prison , Kenny held a Court TV reporter hostage for several hours by holding a ballpoint pen to her throat . He wound up in permanent solitary confinement . Mother and son were extradited to Los Angeles for trial on another , older murder , and both were ultimately convicted .
494591	342623	59630	6.0	Adaptation of a John O'Hara novel	Suzanne Pleshette has " A Rage to Live " in this 1965 potboiler also starring Bradford Dillman , Ben Gazzara , Linden Chiles , Carmen Matthews , Bethel Leslie and Peter Graves . The film is an adaptation of a John O'Hara novel , and I understand from people who have read the book that it's not a very good one . Pleshette plays Grace Caldwell , a young woman who feels validated and loved only when she's having sex . After an incident with a boy in her home town , Grace's mother ( Matthews ) suffers a heart attack . The two take a vacation , where Grace takes up with a waiter . While she's with him one night , her mother has a fatal heart attack and dies . Eventually Grace meets Sidney Caldwell ( Dillman ) . They fall in love , and Grace confesses her misdeeds to him ; he wants to marry her . They have a son , and for three years , all is well . Then construction worker Roger Bannon arrives to work on the Caldwell property and admits to Grace that he's always wanted her . The two have an affair , which Grace ends , only to have Roger beat up a hooker and call her Grace and talk about what a slut she is before he's killed in a car accident . Sidney finds out and wants to end the marriage ; she talks him into giving her one more chance . Then she's publicly accused of having an affair with an old friend ( Graves ) by his wife ( Leslie ) , which isn't true . The end of this film is not very satisfying . We are led to believe that Grace is finished . She probably is - after that public humiliation , it's doubtful Sidney will want to continue the marriage . However , certainly he is assured by the Graves character that nothing went on between him and Grace . So in the end , Grace is doomed because of something she didn't do . Suzanne Pleshette hit Hollywood about ten years too late - she would have had a chance to become a major star before the studios dissolved . She was beautiful with a gorgeous figure , a sexy voice and one other attribute - she was a wonderful , honest actress . Her big career would be in television , and it was a good one , but nothing like she could have had . Here she rises above some overblown material to give a strong , sympathetic performance . The rest of the cast is good . Bethel Leslie as the alcoholic Amy Hollister has some good scenes as Peter Graves ' insecure and unreasonable wife . Ben Gazzara does a fine job with an off-the-wall , obsessive character . In the book , Sidney dies before he can divorce Grace , and Grace moves away . I suppose having her cry in the middle of the road was more effective . " A Rage to Live " is good to see for Pleshette and for the way an explicit subject matter was handled in the ' 50s . With a lesser actress in the lead , it might have seemed very campy .
494358	342623	59557	6.0	Yet another ' 60s spy caper , this one pre-global warming	James Coburn is " Our Man Flint " in this 1966 spy film . Flint is called in by our government to find and destroy the enemy's capability to control the weather . Given our current situation with global warming , it was actually quite interesting . The cool , perfect Flint is a derivative of James Bond , a gadget-ridden spy , unflappable in the face of certain death , totally brilliant , and a sex machine surrounded by gorgeous , buxom women . Played by the resonant-voiced , angular-faced James Coburn , Flint sails through his assignment , not only escaping death but faking death when it suits him . It's a fun movie , but it's amazing how many of this type of film and spy films in general were made in the ' 60s - not only the Bond films , but caper films like Topkapi , Gambit , the Harry Palmer films , Casino Royale ( where James bond was a character ) - these films and takeoffs of them , like The Glass-Bottomed Boat - abounded . It's always nice to reminisce about the ' 60s , and " Our Man Flint " has the music , the dancing , the gowns , the gadgets and the bustlines that will take you right back . A good time .
494995	342623	32539	6.0	There's gold in them thar hills	" Gold Rush Maisie " has Maisie ( Ann Sothern ) prospecting in this 1940 entry into the series . Maisie's car breaks down , and she becomes stranded and has to ask for help from an isolated , nasty rancher ( Lee Bowman ) who shares his house with another sourpuss ( Slim Somerville ) . These films all followed the same formula - Maisie's charm , no-nonsense attitude and warmth melt the icebergs she meets . Later on , she meets a family of farmers who have lost their farm and become migrant workers . Now they're on their way to prospect for gold . Maisie is stunned at how little they have and sets out to help them . The atmosphere of " Gold Rush Maisie " is a little more down than usual , and the actions of the rancher played by Lee Bowman are inexplicable . First he's nasty , then he abruptly puts the moves on Maisie , becomes nasty again and later , after she tells him off , he becomes nice . Bowman was Sothern's leading man in the series more than once , as was James Craig - I prefer James Craig , who had more energy and variety in his acting . One does really feel for the family , and that helps to hold one's interest . Sothern does her usual bang-up job . The previous reviewer has it right - she would have been a bigger star in an earlier era . But if huge movie stardom eluded her , she still played some wonderful roles , and her two series are a treasure , as is the actress herself .
494133	342623	32556	6.0	When life mocks you , mock it back	Some classic age actors , when seen today , appear hammy and using old-fashioned technique . And some are timeless . John Barrymore is timeless and , in one of his last films , " The Great Profile , " he lampoons himself mercilessly - in the role of a ham with old-fashioned technique . The story is based on what really happened to the actor during a play called " My Own Children . " The actor Evans Garrick ( Barrymore ) has been missing for three days . When he arrives home drunk , he's in costume and he's reciting Shakespeare , believing that he just left a film set an hour earlier . Infuriated , his wife Sylvia ( Mary Beth Hughes ) leaves him . Then pretty Mary Maxwell ( 17-year-old Anne Baxter ) arrives with a play she is desperate for Garrick to do . He gets rid of her by saying he will meet her in his agent's office the next day . His agent ( Gregory Ratoff ) owes some mobsters $8200 and when he hears that Ms . Maxwell has a wealthy fiancée , Richard Lansing ( John Payne ) who will back the play , he's all for it . It's a complete disaster , but it gets Sylvia back from Reno as soon as she hears about it , and she wins back her role . Totally polluted by the second act , Garrick makes the play a hit by ad-libbing and finally rolling off of the stage in a wheelchair . Ms . Maxwell is finally convinced to take what she considered her serious drama into New York , where it's been booked for a six-month run , but she takes Garrick in hand to sober him up . Everyone's unhappy - her fiancée and Garrick's agent in particular , since the play is deathly if Garrick isn't drunk . Strangely enough , most of this actually happened to Barrymore in real life , including his wife leaving him and returning to get her part back in New York . And she did hide in Barrymore's wardrobe as Garrick's wife does in the film , though in real life , Barrymore's daughter Diana tried to keep her from doing so . Barrymore is extremely dissipated in " The Great Profile " and reads his lines off of cue cards , which toward the end , he did often . For people who say he's a ham , I say he was playing one . He does Hamlet with a quivering sing-song voice . Does anyone believe this is actually how he played his famous Hamlet ? He was Olivier's inspiration for the role . Olivier first played Hamlet in 1937 and was known for speaking the dialogue instead of singing it . There are some very funny moments in " The Great Profile " but in the end , it's a bizarre movie , enlivened by Barrymore's presence . If you want to see a non-hammy Barrymore , I suggest " The Great Man Votes " or " Bill of Divorcement . " He was a great actor with a big personality - if that seems strange by today's standards , well , it's the pictures that got small .
494531	342623	63452	6.0	glossy ' 60s sci fi	This interesting sci fi film stars George Hamilton and Suzanne Pleshette , and features some former stars / near stars who had seen better days : Yvonne DeCarlo , Richard Carlson , Aldo Ray , and Gary Merrill ( in a real stepdown from All About Eve ) . Among the older stars , Michael Rennie has a larger supporting role . The cast , a good budget , and an intriguing script make for an entertaining film about the attempt of one megamind to ferret out who's a threat to him among a group of scientists . One of them has telekinesis , and after the murder of the whistle-blower , played by Arthur O'Connell , Hamilton tries to find O'Connell's old friend , whose name was written on a piece of paper , suspecting him of somehow being involved . This is a neat drama , all the more interesting in seeing the young stars , Hamilton and Pleshette , play against the older Hollywood types .
494829	342623	33650	6.0	First of the Falcon series	George Sanders is " The Gay Falcon , " a 1941 film , the first entry into the Falcon series . The title has a double meaning , as the Falcon's first name is Gay . Though it's a programmer , " The Gay Falcon " has quite an uptown cast , including Gladys Cooper , Allen Jenkins , Turhan Bey , and Wendy Barrie . The Falcon and his sidekick Goldie ( Jenkins ) are insurance brokers in this , and Gay is , as usual , engaged . After turning down an invitation to a fancy party , Helen , secretary to a Perle Mesta type named Maxine who is giving the party , begs him to attend in order to prevent a jewel robbery . Maxine's events have been the scene of a string of jewel robberies . So Gay attends . A woman who insisted on wearing a huge diamond is murdered . Gay is on the case . George Sanders makes a very appealing Falcon - he's tall , elegant , and smooth , with a great voice and off-the-cuff delivery . He gives the role a light , breezy quality . The rest of the cast is very good . Turhan plays a swarthy , suspicious type - this was pre-Maria Montez and Sabu . It's always great to see the Turhan Bey , one of the actors who benefited from the man shortage in Hollywood during World War II . Though he eventually returned to his native Vienna to work as a photographer , he did quite a few television appearances in the ' 90s . Alas , there is a bit of casting that sort of gave the denouement away for this viewer , but the mystery is not really the point of The Falcon series . The point is to have fun , which you will .
495121	342623	30491	7.0	Lassie's producer as the heroine of many young girls	Bonita Granville plays smart , courageous , spunky Nancy Drew in this programmer based on the novels by Caroline Keene . It's been a long time since I read any Nancy Drews , or since my mother read the books , but one remembers every detail . The roadster , her friend named George , her boyfriend named Ned , and the Drew housekeeper named Hannah . For reasons known only to the studio , Ned is now Ted ( guess they didn't like the alliteration ) , there's no George ( guess they didn't want a girl with a boy's name ) and the housekeeper is named Effie ( you tell me why ) . Nancy still has her roadster . The Nancy Drew mysteries are wonderful reads , and this film was fun to watch , even with the little changes . Bonita Granville , who , as Bonita Granville Wrather became the producer of the " Lassie " TV series , certainly looks like Nancy ( who in the books was always having " luncheon " ) . I had always envisioned while reading the books a more sophisticated , less madcap Nancy , but Granville's energetic ( almost hyper ) characterization fits a film portrayal well . Ned is a little bit of a goof , but a smart one . John Litel was right casting as Carson Drew , Nancy's father , a widower who didn't date . The plot can be figured out in the first ten seconds , but these movies were for the teen-aged audience who knew the books . Very enjoyable , and a slice of ' 30s life which is no more .
494912	342623	38922	7.0	Slow and very sentimental	" Sentimental Journey " is a 1946 film starring Maureen O'Hara , John Payne , Connie Marshall , Cedric Hardwicke and William Bendix . Set in New York City , it's the story of an actress , Julie Beck ( O'Hara ) and her director / producer husband Bill Wetherly ( Payne ) . They have an idyllic marriage , but Julie has a precarious heart condition . Realizing she may die and leave her husband alone , she wants to adopt a child . She meets Hitty ( Marshall ) , who was very much like her as a child , filled with fantasies and dreams , and the two hit it off immediately . However , her spoiled and somewhat jealous husband finds he isn't totally happy with the arrangement . " Sentimental Journey " is a slow-moving film with a very attractive cast . It's not for people who , as Margo Channing said , " detest cheap sentiment . " Whether you like the movie or not , you'll find yourself drawn into the story , so have a box of tissues nearby . I blubbered like a baby . Maureen O'Hara is stunningly beautiful and gives a very gentle performance as Julie ; handsome John Payne is just right as her husband , a man whose world centers around his wife . William Bendix has a film-stealing role and is terrific as Donnelly , an associate of Bill's and friend of the family . His sense of comedy is great . Cedric Hardwicke is too much of a big gun to play a small part like the doctor ; he plays it beautifully , but he's wasted . Connie Marshall is Hitty . She's not only adorable , but she has to run a gamut of emotions and pulls it off very well . Nice movie .
494433	342623	373024	7.0	Derivative script lacks some punch	" Imaginary Heroes " is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver , Jeff Daniels , Emile Hirsch , Michelle Williams , and Kip Pardue . The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child ( Pardue ) commits suicide . " Ordinary People " has been mentioned often in relation to this film ; it's sort of " Ordinary People " with a role reversal . The mother in this case , Sandy Travis ( Weaver ) is more accessible than the father , Ben ( Daniels ) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope . Like " Ordinary People , " the younger son Tim ( Hirsch ) is the focus of the film . For me , the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it . There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son , mother and neighbor , brother and sister ( Williams ) and some good offbeat moments . What never clicked was Ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with Sandy . This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris . In one scene in a grocery store , the checkout kid assumes Sandy is " about 30 " and gives her his phone number . In almost the next scene , Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday . Weaver was 55 when this film was made , actually probably 54 , and looks phenomenal . So what is Ben looking at ? However , there's something askew about Ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how Daniels ever WAS attached to that family . The end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes . Everyone is very good , with Weaver and Hirsch being the standouts . There's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares . The script could have been sharper . But " Imaginary Heroes " is a good effort .
494276	342623	420671	7.0	Lovely remembrance of a lovely lady	Hosted by Kathleen Turner , " Myrna Loy : So Nice to Come Home To " is a good , if not terribly informative , documentary about Loy , the qualities she brought to film , and her evolution from exotic , mysterious female roles to light comedy . There is a heavy amount of focus on her film partnership with William Powell and the 14 movies they made together , including , of course , " The Thin Man " series . There is some biographical information provided and photos of the very young Loy , but the documentary clearly is concerned with her work as an actress . There are no interviews with friends , coworkers , or family , and nothing from the lady herself . Lots of film clips are scattered throughout , with emphasis on the " Nice to Come Home To " - showing various scenes of this , including Frederic March's return from the war in " The Best Years of Our Lives , " and coverage of the wonderful work Myrna Loy did for The Red Cross during World War II . She was as lovely inside as she was out , it seems . Very enjoyable .
495081	342623	34890	7.0	Bad Bette ! Bad , bad Bette !	Holy Toledo - Bette Davis has played some really bad women in her life , but the part of Stanley tops it ! Davis , Olivia de Havilland , Dennis Morgan , Charles Coburn , and George Brent star in " In This Our Life , " an odd film from 1942 . Davis and de Havilland play Stanley and Roy ( guess dad wanted boys ) . Stanley is dating Craig ( Brent ) and Roy is married to Peter , a doctor ( Morgan ) . The film no sooner begins than Stanley and Peter run away together . It doesn't take long before Stanley becomes dissatisfied with Peter's lack of money as a young surgeon and his hospital hours . After Peter's suicide ( I wonder ) , the good Roy comes and brings her sister back home . Meanwhile , Roy has started to see Craig . Stanley hates being home and prevails upon her lecherous uncle ( Coburn ) to give her money so she can go away . Meanwhile , I swear she's trying to kill him by plying him with booze . It goes from there , with Stanley becoming more and more horrid with each passing frame of film . Her best line is " YOU'RE AN OLD MAN ! WHO CARES IF YOU DIE ? I'M YOUNG . I'VE GOT MY WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF ME . " Totally outrageous . One comment asks if it's Davis or the script that wrecks this film . I blame the script . You have the too good sister , so good she's saintly - I mean , her sister stole her husband and she doesn't slap her silly - and then you have the bad sister , so bad she's absurd . Then there's the treatment of black people which is offensive - though that is acknowledged in the film . Plus , Sidney's relationship with Uncle William will give rise to a lot of speculation . At one point , Olivia de Havilland looks at a portrait of an ugly relation and says , " I'm not as pretty as she is . " Well , if that were going to be the case , someone should have done a better job on the painting . De Havilland is absolutely beautiful and gives a very good , sober , well-grounded performance - in juxtaposition to Davis batting her eyes , pouting , and sashaying . Huston obviously didn't know how to handle her . Davis was capable of brilliant performances but she had to be in sync with her director . She wasn't . Morgan and Brent are the mild types of leading men Warners usually cast opposite strong women . Morgan is very handsome and believable as the put-upon Peter - and if he did kill himself , you can't really blame him . Brent does a good job as the attorney who turns his attentions to Roy . As the young black man whose future is threatened by darling Stanley , Ernest Anderson gives a wonderful performance , giving his character the appropriate likability , intelligence , and lack of aggression . Always an excellent emotional actress , Hattie McDaniel scores as his mother . This thing is one big potboiler , complete with an overwhelming score by Max Steinberg that is really a bit much . So is the movie . And guess what , I still recommend it . Even an overdone Bette is better than no Bette at all .
494978	342623	478087	7.0	Loosely based on the true story	" 21 " is the story of the famous MIT Blackjack Team that plays fast and loose with the real story . Nevertheless , it's still a compelling and interesting movie . It's really a morality tale about a brilliant young man , Ben Campbell ( Jim Sturgess ) is talked by a professor ( Kevin Spacey ) into joining a blackjack group that counts cards , uses hand signals , codes , and disguises , and goes to Vegas every weekend . Ben has been accepted into Harvard pre-med but has no way of getting the $300 , 000 tuition . In this story , there are no such things as financial packages and student loans . Ben reluctantly joins the group but only until he can make his Harvard money . Of course , that's not what happens . Once in and living the high life , he can't stop . He finally becomes so arrogant that he makes what turns out to be a very costly mistake . The shots of Boston , where I went to school , and Vegas are great , and the acting is excellent . Sturgess is joined by the beautiful Kate Bosworth , Aaron Yoo , Liza Lapira , and Jacob Pitts . Laurence Fishburne has a small role , but he's scary as all get-out as a security man . Two real-life members of the Blackjack Team played card dealers . In the actual story , there were several of these groups out of MIT that played for years . In telescoping the story , there are a few holes . For instance , Campbell never wears a disguise until the end , which in real life , never happened . The only one who consistently wears a disguise is Bosworth ; these teams were much more careful than that . Also , they seem to go to Vegas every week instead of switching off with Atlantic City , for instance , or laying low for a time . There are a few interesting twists in " 21 , " and it moves quickly . Recommended - a very good movie .
494008	342623	35770	7.0	Female ensemble cast in World War II drama	NO SPOILERS HERE A cast of some top actresses make up the ensemble of " Cry Havoc , " a film about war nurses and volunteers in Bataan , their courage , hard work , and sacrifices . Margaret Sullavan heads the cast in her second to last film . An accomplished stage actress , her last film was in 1950 , 10 years before her suicide . She is marvelous as the head nurse with two secrets . She is joined by Fay Bainter , Ann Sothern , Joan Blondell , Ella Raines , Marsha Hunt , and others . Even today , this is a difficult film to watch , and one can really feel the dirt , the fear , the hunger , the frustration , and the sorrow these women experienced . I can't imagine the impact when it was first released during World War II . We know that the World War II films produced in the ' 40s were whitewashed - men who were on the actual Bataan Death March think movies depicting it are a joke , and there was certainly nothing produced like " Saving Private Ryan " back then . I have no idea whether " Cry Havoc " was an accurate depiction of life at war but it presented nothing romantic , desirable , or pretty , except for the very brave nurses who represented the real thing serving our country in World War II . SPOILERS AHEADThough the ending of the film is somewhat depressing , nurses who served at Bataan and were taken prisoner were treated with great respect by the Japanese , and worked in an internment hospital until they were evacuated . According to what I've read , all the nurses who were there made it home .
494452	342623	53247	7.0	two Alecs are better than one	We've seen it done a hundred times - twins switching identities - but somehow , having Alec Guinness as the twins makes The Scapegoat a cut above the other switch films . Guinness , of course , played multiple roles with great success in the fantastic Kind Hearts and Coronets , so twins for him must have seemed a cinch . In Kind Hearts , he had the benefit of a variety of disguises and voices . In this film , he had to create two completely different characters who look exactly alike . Of course he does so magnificently . This isn't the most successful DuMaurier adaptation - that honor has to go to Rebecca , in my book , but The Scapegoat has a strong cast - Guinness , Bette Davis , Irene Worth , Pamela Brown , and the lovely Nicole Maurey . The atmosphere of this black and white film is somewhat depressing , given the gargantuan , ugly home the family resides in - but it is certainly the right mood for what Guinness inherits when his double disappears . Bette Davis is good , if on the grand guignol side . Guinness does so much with just a gesture , her histrionics seem out of place . All in all , it's a good film - it's very hard to go wrong when Alec Guinness is involved .
493621	342623	289992	7.0	strong and involving	The Life of David Gale is not meant to be taken as realistic , for clearly , it is not . Although extremely convoluted , it is nevertheless compelling and keeps you guessing up until the very end . This is not a simplistic plot , but one that the viewer must follow carefully . This viewer was left with a couple of questions , in fact . Kevin Spacey's lecture to his students near the beginning of the film , and his monologue to Kate Winslett toward the end of the film are the bookends for a marvelous performance ; what he lacks in warmth , he makes up for in wryness and in the way he colors his performance . Laura Linney was her usual marvelous self . The beautiful Kate Winslett was excellent , her strongest scenes coming later on in the film . One thing that struck me was that the first 15 minutes seemed to be written by someone else . They are definitely not as good as the rest of the movie - the dialogue is awkward and Winslett definitely seems to be establishing a very stereotypical character - the beautiful but bitchy and ambitious reporter who feels the sting of sexism . Fortunately this script awkwardness faded quickly .
493815	342623	26043	7.0	Grable tries to solve a murder which might involve a friend of Bennett's	Clark Gable and Constance Bennett star in " After Office Hours , " a 1935 film directed by Robert Z . Leonard . Gable is Jim Branch , the go-getter editor of a newspaper , who is hot on the trial of a society love triangle . Irritated with the music critic , Sharon Norwood ( Bennett ) , he fires her , only to find out that evening that she is very good friends with all the parties . He then not so subtly tries to find out as much as he can . When the woman in the triangle is murdered , he's certain that he knows who did it - but since it's someone Sharon is close to , he's going to have a tough time of it . Gable and Bennett make a great team , though how Sharon ever believed a word coming out Branch's mouth is beyond me . Bennett is beautiful with outfits that match her elegant looks , and Gable makes a pretty glib Jim - also an insincere one . One assumes Sharon was in love with him and gave him the benefit of the doubt . You really couldn't blame her . A delightful film with two wonderful stars .
494834	342623	29737	7.0	A runaway bride plot is an excuse for lots of fashions and music	Joan Bennett runs out on her wedding day and takes up with fashion designer Warner Baxter in " Vogues of 1938 " which is a combination of musical numbers and fashion shows with a little plot in between . And it's in Technicolor ! Bennett has reddish-blonde hair here and resembles Lucille Ball a little but her voice is similar to her sister Constance . I'm so used to her as a beautiful brunette that the change took some getting used to - it has to be shortly after that she did a screen test for " Gone With the Wind , " and by then , she had dark hair . In this story , after she abandons her wedding , she falls for the married Baxter ( who designed and made her gown ) and becomes a model in his fashion house . Baxter's wife is an ambitious performer who persuades him to back a show she's in - and it nearly breaks him . There are some great scenes - I have to admit , I thought the roller skaters were spectacular . There was a wonderful scene at the Cotton Club , another at El Morocco , and the entire finale is a fashion show done as a musical . The gowns and suits are gorgeous . Precious little plot here but plenty of shots of the New York of the ' 30s , some good music , dancing , gowns - and oh , those roller skaters !

O'Neal plays Rone , who is removed from military service and put on the mission because of his photographic memory . Each man and Parkins , who is a safecracker sent in place of her arthritic father , is assigned a group to infiltrate , all with the objective of finding this anti-Chinese letter . Or is that what the assignment is really about ? This is an extremely cold and vicious look at the spy game - it's no fun caper film . It's absorbing , moves quickly and is filled with marvelous , if not altogether likable characters . The last moment in the film will leave you breathless . With a cast like this , the acting should be uniformly excellent , and it is , with the not-so-talented but beautiful Parkins given a role where she doesn't have to do any scenery chewing . George Sanders is especially memorable as the spy assigned to the gay contingent . O'Neal underplays , which is ideal for his character . Many people on this board won't remember that Richard Boone was a prominent western TV star who had aspirations of being taken seriously as an actor . In fact , he even started some sort of repetory company , as I recall . He was very talented , and here plays the head man to perfection , blond hair , down-home accent and all . Very intriguing , done at a time when spy films were a dime a dozen . " The Kremlin Letter " stands out for its detachment and lack of sentiment .
493849	342623	35432	7.0	And introducing Alan Ladd	Both Alan Ladd and Tyrone Power made their film debuts in 1932's Tom Brown of Culver ; by 1936 , Power was a star . It took Alan Ladd a long 10 years and something like 40 films to make it , but make it he did as a cat-loving contract killer in " This Gun for Hire , " also starring Veronica Lake , Laird Cregar and Robert Preston . Ladd plays Phillip Raven , a contract killer in San Francisco who is hired to " off " a blackmailer and retrieve a formula from him . What he doesn't know is that his employers paid him in marked bills and then reported him to the police as the killer of the man , hoping to get him out of the way . Their plan is to sell the formula to the Germans . A Senate committee is suspicious of one of the traitors , a night-club owner named Willard Gates ( Cregar ) and send in a performer , Ellen Graham ( Lake ) to work undercover for them , unbeknownst to her LA policeman boyfriend ( Preston ) . Graham and Raven are mistakenly connected by Gates , and soon both are on the run from him . " This Gun for Hire " is thickly plotted but nevertheless somehow holds the viewer's interest , most likely because of the characterizations . The diminutive , beautiful Lake is an absolute delight as a singer with a magician routine . As one of the villains , Laird Cregar creates an excellent character - a hugely built fraidy-cat who abhors violence . And Ladd's Phillip Raven , vicious though he is , is a man who learned in childhood not to trust anyone and not to get too close to anyone . He's a sad character - and this is as close to acting from Ladd as you'll get . In future films , he says his lines in a monotone , though his tough guy persona is very effective . Here , he plays a ruthless man given to outbursts as well as depression . His paired with Lake , which perhaps was continued because she was a good height for him , is heaven-sent - these are two noir actors who fit the genre perfectly , if for different reasons . " This Gun for Hire " makes for compelling drama , but it's sad to watch as well . Cregar died two years after the film's release , at the age of 28 , with what would have been a great career lost ; after a failed suicide attempt ( his mother was a suicide ) , Ladd would die of an alcohol and drug overdose at the age of 51 ; and the rage with her peek-a-boo hairdo , Lake , by the ' 50s , would be an alcoholic working as a bartender in a hotel before dying at age 54 . You could say this is a " curse " film , but one can say that about so many - the lives of the people who made these classics just weren't fun . A shame , because they left us with such great work .
493966	342623	64211	7.0	Drama of the supernatural	Scientist Ray Milland believes he's seeing and speaking to his late young daughter in " Daughter of the Mind , " also starring Gene Tierney and Don Murray . I suspect this was a pilot for a series on psychic phenomenon that was to star Murray ; hence the " guest starring " credits for Tierney and Milland . This is an intriguing drama . Milland is a scientist involved in sensitive government work , and our side is convinced that the messages he's getting from his daughter to quit what he's doing - bringing into play the possibility of defection - are a conjurer's trick by the other side . George MacCready , who plays Murray's boss , asks him to investigate . There are some sticking points for Murray . He sees the girl's image , he hears her voice - and then , during a séance , a wax replica of her hand appears in water , with verifiable fingerprints yet ! If these things aren't true , how are they being accomplished ? John Carradine , who plays an expert in the field of séances and mediums , advises him , " You're going about it the wrong way . Don't ask if it was a trick . Ask yourself , if you were going to do it , how would you ? " Gene Tierney plays Milland's wife . 1969 was the last year she worked with the exception of one appearance in 1980 . Though not Laura any longer , the blue eyes are still beautiful and vibrant , her smile is still lovely , and though illness has taken its toll , she is still beautiful . Ray Milland is fine as the devastated father though his bad hairpiece is distracting . He lost his hair after a permanent he received for " Reap the Wild Wind , " and eventually embraced baldness . Pamelyn Ferdin , a popular child actress of the day , plays the daughter . All in all , a very interesting story .
493637	342623	44829	7.0	small comedy remembered for early Audrey Hepburn	This is a small but enjoyable comedy mostly remembered today for an early Audrey Hepburn appearance at the beginning of the film . Blink and you miss her , but she is beautifully chic . The story concerns the reminisences of a criminal , marvelously played by Alec Guinness , who , after 20 long years escorting gold bullion shipments , finally figures out how to disguise the gold and move it out of England . The man who supplies the means is Stanley Holloway . This is a fun film where the main theme is that the joy is in the ascent and not necessarily making it to the top of the ladder . The word ascent brings the word descent to mind , and there is a dizzying one from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel Tower , as the two chase some schoolgirls who inadvertently got their hands on gold souvenirs . There is also an excellent car chase . You're really pulling for the " bad guys " - although you can't call them that - all the way . It's a charming comedy , not up there with " The Ladykillers " or " Kind Hearts and Coronets , " but still wonderful .
494566	342623	44916	7.0	Grant at his screwball best	Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers go back to their childhoods in " Monkey Business , " about a youth formula mixed up by a monkey . It's a real ' 30s screwball comedy in the hands of three masters - Howard Hawks , Grant , and Rogers , and the concept is a funny one , even if it does get a bit tedious . Marilyn Monroe is delicious in a supporting role as a secretary who can't type . Hugh Marlowe and Charles Coburn are the straight men - Coburn is the head of the company that wants Grant's formula , except that Grant's formula is worthless . When his back was turned , one of his experimental monkeys mixed up the magic concoction and dropped it in the water cooler . After a glass , Grant becomes a college kid again and takes Monroe on a whirl . Then Rogers uses the water to make coffee . . . It's amazing that Grant was still making these movies twenty years after he started , but he's as agile as ever . This is a fun watch and of great interest because of Monroe .
494303	342623	44502	7.0	A flop Clifford Odets play makes a strong film	Barbara Stanwyck , Paul Douglas , Robert Ryan , Marilyn Monroe , and Keith Andes star in " Clash by Night , " based on the play by Clifford Odets that flopped on Broadway . It gets the full-blown treatment on the screen , with Fritz Lang directing and a strong group of actors . Stanwyck is a world-weary woman who comes back to her roots because " home is where you go when you run out of places , " and immediately attracts male attention from both Ryan and Paul Douglas . She's instantly attracted to Ryan , and each recognizes in the other an edginess and need for excitement . To fight these urges , which haven't brought her any joy in the past , she marries Douglas , a simple fisherman who is deeply in love with her . It's not long before she gets antsy . The acting is terrific , but the emotions are very big - possibly too big for the screen and more suited to the stage . Though everyone is excellent , Douglas has the sympathetic role and breaks your heart as the cuckolded husband . Ryan is great as a volcano waiting to erupt , and Stanwyck's portrayal is ferociously honest and layered . She was 45 at the time of thee filming and obviously playing someone a good 10 years younger , but it still works . Marilyn Monroe has a supporting role playing the girlfriend of handsome Keith Andes . He mainly shows off his physique , though he was actually a good actor who had success in TV and was also a powerful singer , playing opposite Lucille Ball on Broadway in " Wildcat . " Monroe , mostly in jeans and with a swimsuit scene , is beautiful and her acting is very natural . Later on in her career , she overpronounced her words , which worked well in comedy but less so in drama . This is a very good movie with vigorous direction by Lang . There's just not much about it that's subtle .
494843	342623	51878	7.0	Long and hot all right , with a tremendous cast	Paul Newman stars with Joanne Woodward , Orson Welles , Lee Remick , Anthony Franciosca , Richard Anderson and Angela Lansbury in " The Long , Hot Summer , " based on stories by William Faulkner . It's a lushly produced film about a drifter , Ben Quick ( Newman ) , who comes to town . His reputation precedes him , and he soon upsets the status quo in the wealthy Varner family , headed by Orson Welles with a fake nose that kept melting off and an even faker southern accent . There's the weak , insecure son ( Franciosa ) married to a sex kitten ( Remick ) and an unmarried daughter ( Woodward ) saving herself for a momma's boy ( Anderson ) . In town , there's also Varner Sr . ' s mistress , played by Angela Lansbury . Ben sets his sights on Clara Varner and puts himself in direct competition with nervous son Jody for papa's approval . But Quick ultimately needs to reach underneath his swagger and bravura and confront his cut and run philosophy . This is a fantastic cast that delivers sparkling dialogue and an interesting story that has mostly well-drawn characters . The exception would probably be Remick , who has a small but showy role . She doesn't get to do much except show off her figure and sexiness . Welles is a riot - a marvelous technician , he knew how to externalize a character perfectly , and he is here the epitome of a Big Daddy type . His southern drawl is outrageous , and why he decided he needed a new nose ( which he had in other roles as well ) is beyond me . Woodward gives a touching performance as a young woman who has been living on hope and can't quite cope with her attraction to the overtly sexual Quick . Franciosa is excellent as a tortured young man unable to win his father's love . But as any film that stars Paul Newman , the movie belongs to him , one of the greatest actors to ever hit the screen . Macho , sexy and handsome , his Ben Quick is angry , determined , manipulative , and disturbing , with a hidden vulnerability . His scenes with Woodward sizzle , and you can see her character blossom under his attention . They're a great couple , both on and off the screen . Highly recommended , as is any film that stars Paul Newman .
494751	342623	21042	7.0	Ruth Chatterton in an early talkie	I watched this film , Lady of Scandal , because I had never seen Ruth Chatterton in a film , and I'm very glad I saw it . There was very witty dialogue , some funny scenes , and some tender moments peppered throughout this movie , which was based on a play . The beginning was a riot , as Chatterton , while performing on stage , dances herself over to the wings and hands her fiancée a letter from his family . " Your family is horrid ! " she exclaims while doing her high kicks . The dialogue between Chatterton's prospective parents-in-law is especially funny . It's fascinating to see Basil Rathbone in his pre-Sherlock Holmes days . He was Margaret Mitchell's idea of Rhett Butler , she told a reporter , and it's perhaps a little bit easier to see why in these early films . But it's obvious that when Mitchell wrote her famous book , she envisioned her characters somewhat differently and from another perspective . Rathbone could have been a dashing southern gentleman but the ruggedness and sexiness would have been lost . Chatterton was a charming performer with a wide range , as exhibited in this film . She could do the theatrical diva , as well as comedy and pathos . I look forward to seeing more of her films .
493714	342623	99141	7.0	bad day at the zoo for Mel and Goldie	The star power of Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn help this 1990 action film , which is about a witness protection program refugee who reconnects by accident with his old girlfriend . The two then run to avoid the people after him . And run and run and run . There are so many chase scenes in this movie , I lost count , but they lead to a very effective finale in the zoo . I enjoyed this movie because of its two stars . I thought they had great chemistry and repartee . The movie is short on plot and character development , you know , things that one would occasionally enjoy seeing in a film , and long on action , charm , Mel's rear , Goldie's figure , and fashion . On this basis , I found it enjoyable .
495033	342623	19702	7.0	Unquestionably Hitchcock	Britain's first talkie , the 1929 " Blackmail , " is directed by Alfred Hitchock , and even back then , it has many of his touches . The stars are Anny Ondra , Cyril Ritchard , John Longden , and Sara Allgood . A young woman ( Ondra ) two-times her Scotland Yard inspector boyfriend ( Longden ) and goes out with an artist ( Ritchard ) . Things get rough in his apartment , and he forces himself on her . She kills him ( a la Dial M for Murder ) . Her boyfriend finds her glove in the apartment and realizes she did it ; the other glove was found by a criminal hanging around the artist's apartment building , and he decides to blackmail the inspector . Hitchcock more than appears in this film ; he has a bit with a little boy on a subway . The film is strange in that the beginning is silent with no title cards . Then suddenly , there is sound . It moves quite slowly , with not much in the way of action . The story builds slowly , and the scene in the artist's apartment is quite long before anything happens . Nevertheless , the Hitchcock touches are there . A pivotal scene happens at the British Museum - Hitchcock's upheaval in familiar places . And in the jail scene , there's a sound the director often described as being terrifying in his childhood when his father had the local police teach him a lesson - the jail door closing . The very pretty Ondra , wife of boxer Max Schmelling , is dubbed here . Ritchard in 1929 is not recognizable as Captain Hook . Worth seeing - it's early Hitchcock and it's an 80-year-old movie . Mind-boggling .
494438	342623	138524	7.0	A sharp divorce attorney meets his match	" Intolerable Cruelty " is a 2003 film starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones , two beautiful stars who definitely harken back to the golden era of Hollywood . This film , directed by Joel Coen , is an attempt to do one of those battle of the wits comedies so successful in that same era , which starred Cary Grant and Irene Dunne , or several other combinations . Despite the star power , " Intolerable Cruelty " isn't as successful as those older films , partly because the writing isn't sharp enough and the pacing isn't fast enough . The premise is a very funny one ; A sharp , successful divorce attorney , Miles Massey ( Clooney ) comes up against a woman , Marylin Rexroth ( Zeta-Jones ) who marries men for the big settlements she can get in a divorce . She is humiliated by him in court , but shows up in his office with her next husband , a rich Texan ( Billy-Bob Thornton ) wanting a prenup . She's is given the famous " Massey prenup , " which has never been broken in court . On their wedding day , her new husband shows his devotion by eating the prenup . Six months later , she dumps him . Miles is fascinated by her and pursues her , at first wanting to learn her secret , and then falling for her . The best part of the film is the very beginning , when a television producer ( Geoffrey Rush ) catches his wife with an old friend of hers who just happens to be selling pool supplies in their neighborhood . The scene sets up " Intolerable Cruelty " to be much funnier than it turns out . Clooney is very funny ; Jones underplays , which here comes off as somewhat lethargic , given Clooney's broad portrayal . Thornton , Edward Herrmann as Marylin's first husband , and the rest of the cast offer excellent support . Certainly not unwatchable , but not completely successful .
494862	342623	292506	7.0	Good film , good cast	Colin Farrell , Al Pacino and Bridget Moynihan star in " The Recruit , " a 2003 film directed by Roger Donaldson . Farrell plays a young man recruited by the CIA in the person of Pacino ; while training at Langley , he gets close to another trainee ( Moynihan ) . Once out of training , he's told she's an infiltrate from another country assigned to following her . As is often said in the film , nothing is as it seems , and both Farrell and the audience are bamboozled more than once . The film has many twists and turns , all of which add up to a very absorbing movie . A weary-looking Pacino is excellent as always , and Farrell is effective . This one keeps the surprises coming , so pay attention .
494893	342623	32353	7.0	A poor man's " Red Dust "	This time , just call Maisie " Congo Maisie " in this 1940 second entry into the " Maisie " series . Each episode of Maisie's fabulous life is done as a separate entity as if the previous one never happened . So don't get too attached to anyone . Maisie , stranded as usual , stows away on a ship that doesn't go the way she wants and , in fact , breaks down . She tags along with a rubber plantation manager ( John Carroll ) when he hikes to his old house where he worked as a doctor ( he's since forsaken the Hippocratic oath ) . Now it's the home of a doctor who does research ( Sheppard Strudwick ) and his wife ( Rita Johnson ) . " Congo Maisie " is chock full of adventure , with Maisie assisting in an emergency operation and , wearing a gown and a Carmen Miranda headpiece from her club act , fends off witch doctors . It's quite funny but as my sister yelled out to me hearing some of it , " Is that a politically incorrect movie you're watching in there ? " Uh , yeah . John Carroll is the new object of Maisie's affections . He talks a lot and uses a monotone that becomes grating real fast . I recall a photo of him where he was presented as a Gable wannabe . Forget it . Rita Johnson is absolutely lovely , and Sheppard Strudwick is very good . Fun .
494949	342623	54652	7.0	okay	Bob Hope is a " Bachelor in Paradise " in this 1961 film also starring Lana Turner , Don Porter , Jim Hutton , Paula Prentiss , Janis Paige and Virginia Grey . Hope plays an author , A . J . Niles , whose specialty is the sexual practices of countries . When the IRS forbids him to leave the country , it's suggested that he concentrate on the U . S . He's sent to a development in California called Paradise and set up in a rental home . It's actually the home of one of the managers of the development , Rosemary Howard ( Turner ) , and she lives elsewhere for the time being . Keeping his identity a secret , Adam , as he is called , holds seminars and discussion groups for the women of Paradise on how to keep their marriages fresh . Some of his advice works ; some doesn't . Meanwhile , he's being pursued by the sexy but married Dolores Jynson , and he himself is after the beautify Rosemary . This seems to be a very popular film with viewers who post here . I didn't make all the connections with it that some did as I don't come from this kind of background , but I can well appreciate how it would resonate if I had . It's a pleasant enough film , and it is a lot of fun to see all of the ' 60s furnishings , colors and styles of hair and dress and to realize how mores have changed with the years . The cast is very good ( and very ' 60s ) as well . People probably thought Prentiss and Hutton were married as they were paired together so often due to Prentiss ' above average height , and it's always great to see Janis Paige and Virginia Grey . My favorite Bob Hope era is that of the 1940s , where he had great material well suited to him . His youthfulness and the cowardly character he played , along with the situations he got into always made his films sparkle . And what leading ladies - Madeline Carroll , Paulette Goddard , Dorothy Lamour , etc . Here he is teamed with glamorous Lana Turner who looks very beautiful in the film and has the right coolness and sophistication for the part . As for Hope , at the age of 58 , he doesn't have that boyish , enthusiastic , naive quality of the old days , and the jokes he's delivering are pretty stale . Unlike " The Private Navy of Sgt . O'Farrell , " " Bachelor in Paradise " is not a dud . Though it's dated , that's part of the fun , and it has some genuinely funny moments , a lively cast and that American icon , Bob Hope . You can love him or hate him , but you can't deny he was a remarkable entertainer to many generations .
494453	342623	58990	7.0	Good B film	By the time " Brainstorm " was made , both Jeffrey Hunter and Dana Andrews had descended into B films . " Brainstorm " was one of them , costarring ' 50s starlet Anne Francis . Directed by William Conrad , it's actually a good movie about an engineer who falls in love with the unhappy wife of a wealthy man ( Andrews ) and concocts a scheme to kill him and get away with it by faking insanity . Hunter is very good in this dramatic role - he was a far better actor than some of his contemporaries but due to his personal demons , he never fulfilled his early promise . It's a shame because he played this kind of angry , edgy role very well , belying his staggering good looks . He gets good support from Andrews , Francis , and Viveca Lindfors , who plays a psychiatrist . There is one scene that may be unintentionally funny - when Hunter is in the asylum , one of the inmates starts singing the beginning of a song over and over again . Hunter finally screams , " Either finish that song or SHUT UP ! " Brainstorm is worth a watch , especially to see Hunter do a role deserving of his abilities , and one he no longer had an opportunity to play in A films .
493493	342623	43873	8.0	Nice film with a young Rock and James Dean	Charles Coburn gives the family of the woman who rejected him $100 , 000 in " Has Anybody Seen My Gal , " a delightful 1952 comedy set in the 1920s . It's directed by Douglas Sirk and also stars Piper Laurie , Gigi Perreau , Lynn Bari , William Reynolds and Skip Homeier . It seems that when Samuel Fulton was a young man , the young woman who turned him down spurned him on to great things . Now , with no heirs , he wants to leave her family his money . Despite his belief that he's dying , he heads to their hometown and moves in on them as a " Mr . Smith " in order to observe them when they are presented with a check for $100 , 000 . Rock Hudson has a supporting role in this film - he plays a soda jerk and the love interest of Piper Laurie . Dancing the Charleston , he is darn cute . And if you think the kid at the soda fountain giving old man Fulton a hard time is James Dean , you're right , it is . People often say that James Dean only made three films . Wrong . He only STARRED in three films . Gigi Perreau is adorable without being cloying . Piper Laurie , in a Debbie Reynolds type of role , does a good job , though later on , she would shine more in drama . But at this point , she and Rock were just paying their dues along with William Reynolds , who became a TV actor . This is Coburn's film all the way - he's a riot as an old codger who gets a dose of health and love from the family and gives some back in return . " Has Anybody Seen My Gal " demonstrates the fine directing gifts of Douglas Sirk whose name would become synonymous with big budget soap operas . But in 1952 , it was fun all the way with Coburn and Universal's stable of young players .
493498	342623	56541	8.0	Newman and Page - yowza !	Geraldine Page , Paul Newman , Madeline Sherwood and Rip Torn all recreate their Broadway roles for the film version of " Sweet Bird of Youth , " a 1962 film based on Tennessee Williams ' play and directed by Richard Brooks . Again and as usual , some bite has been taken out of the original story in order to get past the censors . Geraldine Page is the drunk , drugged and over the hill movie star Alexandra del Lago , who has picked up with a Hollywood gigolo , Chance Wayne and promised him a film career . At present she's escaping from what she perceives as a disastrous comeback . Chance returns with her to his home town , yearning for the respectability and success that has eluded him . Instead he runs into trouble from his ex-girlfriend's crooked politician father , Tom Finley ( Ed Begley ) and Finley's son , Tom Jr . ( Rip Torn ) who want him out of town because of what happened to Heavenly ( Shirley Knight ) . In the play , Chance has given Heavenly a venereal disease ; in the film , she's had an abortion . Chance desperately tries to see and speak with Heavenly , appealing to her Aunt Nonnie ( Mildred Dunnock ) , but it leads to more trouble than he bargained for . Page is a powerhouse as Alexandra , more glamorous than we're used to seeing her and as sloppy a drunk and druggie as you'll ever find . Alexandra's a selfish user , and she's got the technique down pat . The role of Chance , another selfish user , came fairly early on in the handsome Newman's career - he came very close to being typecast as these fast-talking amoral men . In those days , Newman struggled with a lack of emotional availability and these roles fit him beautifully . Thankfully he grew to encompass parts in films such as he had in " The Verdict " and became one of our greatest American actors . Madeline Sherwood , so effective in " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , " is equally good here as Boss Finley's girlfriend ; her scene with Begley in her hotel room is truly terrifying . Begley is fantastic , mean as dirt , as is Torn as his equally cruel son . And " Desperate Housewives " fans will be interested to see a slim , pretty Shirley Knight as Heavenly , a somewhat vapid role for such a strong actress . The DVD has a screen test for Chance by Rip Torn , who would later marry Page . He and Page perform a scene between Alexandra and Chance from the play - though the scene is in the film , it has been changed slightly . It's total stage acting , quite different from the film , but both are excellent , Torn giving Chance a lot of intensity . Though in those days he was very good-looking , he probably didn't come off as enough of a boy toy for the producers . It's a very interesting extra and well worth seeing , as is this somewhat watered-down " Sweet Bird of Youth . "
493479	342623	43792	8.0	Delightful light comedy	" The Mating Season " is a 1951 film that stars Gene Tierney , Thelma Ritter , John Lund , Jan Sterling , Miriam Hopkins and Larry Keating . Tierney and Lund play newlyweds Maggie and Val McNulty - she's a blue blood but broke , and he's up and coming in the corporate world . Val's mom Ellen ( Ritter ) owns a hamburger place but loses it and comes to see her son , only to find out he's getting married . Ellen makes her excuses and works until she has enough money for a new outfit . Then she calls on her new daughter-in-law - only to be mistaken as a maid hired to help with a party the couple is throwing . Ellen is a big hit , and , swearing her son to secrecy , stays on in the house . Then Maggie's arrogant , spoiled mother ( Miriam Hopkins ) comes to town to stay with Maggie and Val . Four becomes a crowd . This is a very sweet , funny film with wonderful ensemble acting and great characters . Tierney has her familiar hairdo ( which around this time she didn't always have ) and looks gorgeous . She's totally charming as Maggie . Lund does a good job as her harried husband , who wants to make good and has just a touch - a slight touch - of being a jerk . It's a weakness that we forgive him for later on . Of course , Ritter steals the show as Ellen , doing a role very familiar to her - a mouthy servant . Hopkins is bigger than life as Maggie's totally obnoxious mother , and Larry Keating is a delight as Val's boss ' father , who has better values than his son will ever have . Jan Sterling has a small part as Val's former girlfriend . As usual , she looks cheap and acts cheaper . Lots of fun - don't miss it .
493577	342623	893148	8.0	Fascinating show on Lifetime	" There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy . " You have to approach " Lisa Williams : Life Among the Dead " with that attitude , or you'll hate it . Lisa , like Allison Dubois in Medium , sees and hears dead people . She's a real person ( as is Allison ) with a British accent , punk hairdo , sunny attitude and a husband and family . I don't have any idea how much the show is edited , but what appears on television is very interesting indeed , showing a strangely practical and paradoxically down to earth woman doing matter of fact , accurate readings for strangers on the street and others by appointment . How often she misses the mark , how many questions she asks , we don't know , again , because we don't know how much of the show is edited . Nevertheless , thanks to Lisa herself , this is a highly entertaining show , sometimes very touching and always fascinating . I have seen several episodes and then lost track of it . I hope Lifetime gets it on a set schedule .
493615	342623	43664	8.0	Slice of American life at the start of the Korean war	" I Want You " is a 1951 film starring Dana Andrews , Dorothy McGuire , Farley Granger , Peggy Dow , Mildred Dunnock , and Martin Milner . The character that Dana Andrews plays , Martin Greer , is perhaps an extension of his character in " The Best Years of Our Lives " four years later . It's post-World War II , the men have returned , purchased homes , started families , and built businesses . Then troops begin to be sent to Korea and the draft letters start coming . The movie deals with the effect on a small-town family and the emotional exhaustion and recent memories of World War II . How difficult it must have been to go to war again , yet many did . Martin refuses to write a letter asking that one of his employees , whose father also works for him , be exempt due to being necessary to his business ; he begins an exemption letter for his brother at his mother's request , but he can't do it . In love with the daughter of a member of the draft board , Martin's brother Jack ( Granger ) believes that he is being drafted to put a distance between himself and his girlfriend ( Dow ) . " We both know the reason why my knee was exempt three months ago and isn't now , " he says to her father ( Ray Collins ) . When he suggests at dinner that rather than have people go into battle , the Army should just drop bombs , his sister-in-law ( McGuire ) throws him out of the house , causing bad blood between her and her in-laws . And it begins a domino effect : Jack and Martin's mother ( Dunnock ) goes home and trashes her living room , filled with war memorabilia supposedly brought back from battle by her husband ( Robert Keith ) but in truth purchased in pawn shops ; he spent the war as a general's orderly in a Paris hotel . What is fascinating is that some of the conversation sounds either like what one heard during the Vietnam days or hears today - one push of a button and we'll all be blown to bits and the desperation to get a deferment . Other parts are strictly Dark Ages : Jack's upper class girlfriend Carrie doesn't want to get married until she's 25 . She wants to travel , learn Japanese , and " maybe even get a job , " all of these things apparently not doable once she's married , the ultimate career goal . Most of the performances are excellent . McGuire gives a striking performance as a woman who lived as an army wife , and for whom the thought of her husband perhaps being asked to serve again brings up a lot of anger . " We've lived in this house two years , " she says . " Two years . Is that all the happiness people are allowed today ? . . . I don't want to be left alone anymore . " Dunnock's character is more restrained by equally effective in her disappointment in having to constantly say goodbye to her sons as they go to war . Matinée idol Granger , at the time under contract to the producer of the film , Sam Goldwyn , always had a youthful and likable screen personality , though he was never much of an actor . Dow is fairly one-note as his girlfriend ; she doesn't bring enough warmth to the role . Dana Andrews brings heart to the part of Martin , a man who tries to live by his own conscience and with honesty . He's really the anchor of the film . Though Andrews had a limited range , what he could do was always very good and with a solid presence . The end of the film is extremely touching , in large part due to him . I was not bored by this movie . I found it very interesting . We've changed in this country and yet we have some of the same concerns . A good deal of the rhetoric sounded quite familiar . Recommended .
493674	342623	30442	8.0	Under-appreciated comedy	Brian Aherne is a hobo taken in by Billie Burke to be a family chauffeur in " Merrily We Live , " also starring Constance Bennett , Alan Mowbray , Bonita Granville , Tom Brown , and Clarence Kolb . The film is basically the same story as " My Man Godfrey " but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it's funnier , though " Godfrey " had the serious undertones ( and William Powell ) that this movie completely lacks . Unfortunately for " Merrily We Live , " it came out at a time when the screwball comedy had had its day . It's so interesting now to see these true gems that suffered from bad timing . " Bringing Up Baby , " regarded today as a classic , also suffered at the box office . The family Aherne comes to work for is never boring . The matriarch , Emily ( Billie Burke ) , is bonkers . She's constantly picking up hobos and hiring them . In the first scene , the last bum in residence has stolen all of the silverware so the family is using all kinds of devices as utensils in order to get through breakfast . The younger daughter Marian ( Bonita Granville ) spends most of her time fooling around with the chimes so that when the harried butler Grosvenor ( Mowbray ) tries to ring them , they fall apart . Grosvenor , by the way , keeps his bags packed and ready to go at all times and leaves in disgust at least once a day . When Marian isn't making Grosvenor's life miserable , she's hitting people up for money in exchange for information . Mr . Kilbourne ( Kolb ) drinks to escape . Jerry , the older daughter ( Bennett , who is 19 years older than Granville ) seems to be the one who keeps things together . Then she falls for Aherne . The last scene in this film should be regarded as the ultimate in screwball . It's one of those things you laugh out loud at even when you're alone . It was commented that Bennett was too old for the role - 34 . She definitely was playing a woman in her twenties , but given that Burke was 53 , Tom Brown ( the son ) was 25 , and Granville was 15 , the ages work out , and those age gaps exist in families . In those days , it was not uncommon , as in my own family , for a woman to have 9 pregnancies and only have three living children spread far apart . Bennett didn't have the best role but she was believable and beautiful . She was almost at the end of her " A " picture leads by 1938 . Tom Brown doesn't have much to do but is very good . Mowbray is terrific , as is Kolb , as a man who knows more about what's going on than he pretends . Patsy Kelly plays one of the house staff , and she gives a stagy and loud performance . She's seen to better advantage elsewhere . Burke is a delightful dingbat . Granville is energetic bordering on hyper , as she always was , and she's perfect as the mischievous daughter . Aherne is very handsome and makes not only a great hobo but a great butler . This was definitely one of his finest roles , and he handles it elegantly . " Merrily We Live " is a real treat , another lost treasure of the ' 30s .
493781	342623	30287	8.0	Warner's answer to GWTW	Bette Davis is a southern belle whose aunt ( Fay Bainter ) calls her Jezebel in a moment of supreme disappointment . This is a 1938 film also starring Henry Fonda , George Brent , and Donald Crisp . Bette is Julie Marsden , a brat engaged to Preston Dillard ( Fonda ) . She soon loses him for what appears to be the second time when she wears a red dress to a ball where all the women are in white . Press goes to the north and returns with a wife ( Margaret Lindsay ) . Julie sets out to win him back , with a bad result . " Jezebel " has many similarities to " Gone with the Wind " - the south , the red dress , the manipulative , strong young woman , her obsession with a man and the disapproval by the family of her actions . The period is the 1850s ; the place is Louisiana , where there is an outbreak of the dreaded yellow fever . Although the film is similar to " GWTW " it stands on its own . It doesn't have the sweeping scope of GWTW . It's the story of one woman's love for a man and the effect it has on those around her . There are some striking scenes : the dance sequence , when Press and Julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red ; and the end is very striking . Bette Davis is great in the title role . Under William Wyler's direction , it's a restrained performance . It's a good thing because she's appearing opposite the master of underplaying , Henry Fonda . All of the women look stunning in their gowns , Davis in particular . As with Scarlett and Ashley , we don't really know what the attraction is between Julia and Press , and the script doesn't tell us . Fonda seems a little on the dull side for a lively girl like Julia . Donald Crisp turns in a powerful performance as Dr . Livingstone , and George Brent is very good as the elegant Buck Cantrell . Highly recommended . One of Davis ' best .

Affleck is attorney Gavin Banek , late for court , when he has a car accident involving Doyle Gipson ( Jackson ) , who is also on his way to court to protest his wife taking his children to live way across the country . Not wanting to mess around with insurance companies , Banek offers to write Gipson a check . Gipson , however , is a recovering alcoholic and has made a commitment to do everything in a " clean " way . He wants to trade insurance cards . Banek can't be bothered and gets into his car , leaving Gipson standing on the highway in torrential rain , although he asked Banek for a lift . When Banek gets to court , he finds he does not have the power of authority necessary to prove that an elderly man knew what he was doing when he fired his board and assigned the law firm to administer his trust . He realizes that he left the folder at the scene . Gipson arrives to court too late to speak on his behalf and finds the Judge has made a decision against him . Banek is desperate to find Gipson and get his document back , since he has only until the end of the day to file it with the court . And Gipson ? Well , he just isn't in the mood to return it . Thus begins a war with each man having the goal of total destruction of the other . Despite other comments on this board , I truly enjoyed this film and found the hard lessons learned by both men as the result of a random accident very interesting . Banek is encouraged by an ex-girlfriend ( Collette ) to question the power of authority and the role of the law firm in administering the trust ; Jackson comes up against his own acting-out behavior , rage , and as his ex-wife says , addiction to drama . " Changing Lanes " is about changing one's path in life from a crooked road to a straight one . It's about values , and it may not be to everyone's taste . The acting was excellent , the film had a fresh feel to it , and I found it thought-provoking . Recommended .
493554	342623	35742	8.0	lovely movie	I saw this film many years ago and remembered nearly all of it . It was a real treat to see it again . Dorothy McGuire recreates her stage role in a wonderful screen debut as Claudia , the guileless child bride of Robert Young . Her naiveté gets her into some difficulty with an amorous neighbor ( Reginald Gardiner ) and her attachment to her ailing mother ( Ina Claire ) is a concern to her husband . McGuire and Young make a charming screen couple - she is all energy and he is more deadpan - it's a nice contrast , and the two characters are obviously very much in love . Ina Claire turns in a warm and touching performance as Claudia's mother . McGuire sparkles in this role , particularly in the transition when Claudia is forced to grow up almost overnight . Of course , she went on to have a great career that spanned nearly 50 years in film . It's easy to see why when you watch " Claudia . " This was followed by a sequel , " Claudia and David . "
494658	342623	30149	8.0	Very good ' 40s film overshadowed by a shot to stardom	" Four Daughters " introduced John Garfield to audiences , and that is what is remembered most about this film today . Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels , Garfield established his immediately , with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him . It's actually the story of four girls , their widowed musician father ( Claude Rains ) and their various suitors , one of whom , Felix , is played by handsome Jeffrey Lynn . He's the one they all have a crush on , but he's in love with Buff ( Priscilla Lane ) . Then she meets ne'er-do-well Mickey Borden , who falls for her as well . When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix , she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey . This is a fairly formulaic story given life ( and sequels ) by the acting . Garfield has already been mentioned , but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters , the most interesting , and the best actress . Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking leading man , and this film got him off on the right foot with Warners . However , true stardom was not to be . Like many others of the era , he went into the service , and when he came out , he had a Bronze Star but not much of a career . He later went into television and real estate . Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch . So popular was " Four Daughters " that it inspired " Four Wives " and " Four Mothers , " as well as reuniting much of the cast again in " Daughters Courageous " where the actors played different characters . Very enjoyable , a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times , and a chance to see John Garfield in his first film .
494919	342623	109417	8.0	Nice noir	Ed Harris and Madeleine Stowe are underneath the temperamental " China Moon " in this 1994 film also starring Benicio del Toro . Harris and del Toro are Kyle Bodine and Lamar Dickey partner detectives with a Florida police department . One night at a bar , Kyle meets Rachel Munro ( Stowe ) and falls for her immediately . She's unhappily married and has photos of her husband ( Charles Dance ) with another woman . He doesn't know this at the time , and tracks her down . They start seeing one another . When her husband winds up dead , Kyle helps her to cover it up . Though the plot is derivative , this is a classily done film with terrific acting , sensual love scenes between the two leads , an easy pace and beautiful photography . It reminded me a little of " Body Heat . " The plot won't be hard to figure out , but be prepared for a couple of twists . Ed Harris gives a forceful performance as Kyle , and del Toro is understated as Lamar . When the camera rests on Stowe , she's flawlessly beautiful , and what clothes ! She gives an effective performance and has a nice chemistry with Harris . " China Moon " is a small , meticulously done movie with loads of talent behind it . The story has been told many times , but somehow , if it's done well , it's always good for another encore .
494508	342623	39431	8.0	It's good news	Peter Lawford , June Allyson , Joan McCracken , Ray McDonald , and Patricia Marshall star in " Good News , " a 1947 MGM musical about life at Tait University . Allyson is Connie Lane , working her way through college and living in a sorority house when she meets the big man on campus and star football player , Tommy Marlowe ( Lawford ) . It looks like love , but he's been after the flashy , uppity new girl ( Marshall ) who's only interested in a man with money . When she thinks Lawford has it , she turns her attentions to him , and he cancels his date with Allyson to the prom - on the night of the event . Had I been Allyson , the story would have ended right there , but this is 1947 and a movie , and it's a wonderful one - energetic and fresh , with good music and fabulous dancing from Broadway star McCracken and McDonald . " Pass the Peace Pipe , " a politically incorrect song by today's standards , is one of the best numbers . Allyson and Lawford make a great couple , and seeing Lawford so young and handsome , dancing and singing is not only a revelation but sad . He's terrific . Look for an unbelievably young Mel Torme in a small but showy role . Delightful - don't miss it .
493892	342623	60424	8.0	Matthau and Lemmon directed by Wilder in a Wilder script - who can ask for anything more ?	When a cameraman is knocked over during a Cleveland Browns game , the sharks move in - or should I say shark - in the form of " Whiplash Willie , " his brother-in-law , in " The Fortune Cookie , " a 1966 film written and directed by Billy Wilder . Lemmon plays Harry Hinkle , a television cameraman , who is involved in a freak accident during a football game , when he is knocked over by " Boom Boom " Jackson . As soon as his brother-in-law , attorney Willie Gingrich ( Matthau ) hears that Harry suffered a compressed vertebrae in his youth ( from jumping off of a garage roof without opening his umbrella ) , he warns his hospitalized victim not to get well . He has a paroled dentist come in and shoot him up with drugs so that he can pass the insurance medical tests , puts him in a wheelchair , a collar , and a corset , and takes him home to recover . Meanwhile , the insurance company has a camera on him and his apartment bugged . Harry's tramp ex-wife ( Judi West ) , an aspiring singer , comes back to him as soon as she smells money to jump-start her career . The guilt-stricken Boom Boom becomes his servant . Boom Boom's football game suffers , and he turns to drink . Whiplash Willie , in the meantime , is negotiating a $200 , 000 settlement . Insurance fraud and ambulance chasers are still very topical . One has only to look at the number of commercials for attorneys telling you an accident is worth big bucks . Leave it to Billy Wilder and partner I . A . L . Diamond to write such a witty , cynical script about a man with a conscience up against a man who will stop at nothing to cheat the insurance company . Walter Matthau is an absolute riot as Willie , and won the Academy Award for his performance . Willie is an obvious cheat who knows all the angles and is able to get around them . Lemmon is great as a lonely man who goes along with the subterfuge with the carrot of his ex-wife returning dangling in front of him . Ron Rich gives a natural , sympathetic performance as Boom Boom , the devastated football player . The script is very witty and the performances are great . Billy Wilder was one of film's greatest writers and directors , and in " The Fortune Cookie , " he shows he's still got what it takes .
494765	342623	18192	8.0	an emotional extravaganza that reaches across time	I had the privilege of seeing the restored version of this film , to the accompaniment of a live orchestra under the baton of Carmine Coppola , in Los Angeles ' un-air-conditioned war memorial . Despite uncomfortable seating and terrible heat , the experience of this four hour movie remains a watershed for anyone who attended . To think that because of the invention of sound , this masterpiece was partially destroyed by Abel Gance in a fit of depression , is heartbreaking . More shocking is that Gance's invention of Cinemascope - of which today only the end of the film retains in its triptych screen effect - was lost to filmgoers until its reinvention years later . Obviously true art can't be hidden forever , and Gance did live to see Napoleon take its rightful place in cinematic history . Though it is many years later , I can still remember the tears and the ovation when the black screen with the white signature , " Abel Gance " , signified the end of the film . A compelling and great work of art .
495210	342623	29442	8.0	Fabulous cast , fabulous swordfight , great direction	John Cromwell directed , David O . Selznick produced , and Ronald Colman , Madeline Carroll , Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , and David Niven star in the 1937 film " The Prisoner of Zenda . " That's really all any viewer needs to know . Rudolph Rassendyll ( Colman ) , King Rudolf V's identical cousin , is asked to impersonate the kidnapped future king ( Colman ) at the coronation . Otherwise , the crown goes to his younger brother . This is a top-notch film with a great performance by Ronald Colman in a dual role , something he was called upon to do during his career several times . Colman was an smooth actor of great charm . One of the comments ( from a man , of course ) asked if he was supposed to be handsome because if he was , the commenter couldn't see it . Just an opinion : Colman was good-looking in the style of actors in the early to mid-thirties , but it was his gentle quality , beautiful speaking voice , and fine acting that put him over with female audiences . Here his fiancé is the gorgeous Madeleine Carroll , and they make a wonderful couple . Douglas Fairbanks Jr . is one of my favorite actors , and he performs the villainous Rupert with panache , creating an excellent character . Raymond Massey is another villain , Michael , and he's very good . David Niven is in a small role - he's on his way up as a younger Colman - in fact , he was supposed to play Colman's brother in Lost Horizon . The end of the film is total action with a magnificent swordfight . Don't miss this version of Prisoner of Zenda .
494815	342623	67240	8.0	entertaining	This was a great script from the prolific Larry Cohen , who wrote episodes for " Columbo , " " Arrest and Trial " ( a forerunner of " Law and Order " ) and episodes for Kraft Suspense Theater and " The Defenders . " He has also written feature films . I'd love to see this film again - I wish it would come out on video . It stars Richard Boone as a newly-blinded actor and Suzanne Pleshette as his teacher . Though the Boone character puts on a big show for Pleshette of refusing to accept his blindness , he coldly and calculatedly trains himself to act as a seeing man so that , in disguise , he can get rid of his wife and her lover . It's a suspenseful story , a fascinating character-study and all around great entertainment . For some reason , this kind of TV movie fare has gone out of style and been replaced by women at risk films , rather slow-moving versions of Robin Cook and Mary Higgins Clark novels and the like . But we mystery buffs old enough to remember the ' 70s remember - with nostalgia - this kind of film .
494874	342623	29322	8.0	The original and the best	" Nothing Sacred " has been remade in whole or part many times but no version comes close to the original 1937 screwball comedy starring Frederic March and Carole Lombard . Directed by William Wellman with a script by Ben Hecht , Nothing Sacred is more topical today than it was then . There's been a good deal written on this board about the political incorrectness of it : racism , drunkenness , physical abuse , stereotyping . It's true , there's something to offend everyone . Instead of judging everything by today's enlightened standards , I prefer to notice that yes , things were different in the past and then move on to the wonderful , witty script , the very modern topic , the great performances , the early , muted color , Lombard's outfits , the old airplane and the scenes of New York as it was in all its glory in the 1930s . March is Wally Cook , a reporter in hot water for writing about the Sultan of Brunai who in reality is a regular Joe working in New York with a wife who identifies him while he's making pronouncements . Wally goes to Vermont to hunt down a story about a woman dying of radium poisoning and finds her in the person of Hazel Flagg ( Lombard ) . Hazel has just gotten some very bad news from her doctor ( Charles Winninger ) - she's not dying . The diagnosis was a mistake . She had hopes of taking a trip out of Vermont that was offered to her and asks the doctor to keep the new diagnosis of health quiet . Soon after , she meets Wally , who wants to bring her to New York for a last fling at the expense of the paper , which will follow her until her last poisoned breath . Hazel agrees and takes the doctor with her . At first , she has a blast with only the occasional twinge of guilt . Then a German specialist is brought in and blows Hazel's scam all to hell . One of the comments had it right - this story predates reality shows by something like 63 years . Hazel , like so many today , is an ersatz celebrity , famous for being famous . What will never change is milking a subject for profit until it's dry . Nothing Sacred has some hilarious scenes and great lines , including the big fight scene in the hotel when Wally tries to make Hazel seem ill by forcing her to fight with him in order to sweat and raise her pulse rate . The nightclub scene is a riot . Lombard is beautiful and wears some stunning outfits and gowns , a gift to Hazel from the newspaper . She was a very adept actress with a wonderful sense of comedy . How sad that she is in a film about dying young and would do so five years later at the age of 34 . She and March do a great job together - he's normally not known for his comedy but does well here . He approach to Wally is serious and he plays Wally's intensity and affection for Hazel for all it's worth . Connelly as his editor is fabulous , as is Winninger as the doctor who drinks his way through New York . Nothing Sacred has been a musical , Hazel Flagg , and remade as Living it Up ( with Jerry Lewis as Homer Flagg ) . Most recently , the general plot was reworked as Last Holiday . See the original in the screwball comedy genre which is , alas , no more .
493876	342623	40367	8.0	Billy visits post-war Berlin	Billy Wilder returned to Berlin after the war to film part of " A Foreign Affair , " starring Marlene Dietrich , Jean Arthur , and John Lund . Wilder lived and worked in Berlin and , following his always excellent instincts , got out and came to America just in time . In the film , a group of government people arrive in Berlin to assess the morale of the 12 , 000 American soldiers still stationed there . One of them is a congresswoman from Iowa , the very uptight and put together Miss Frost , aptly named and beautifully portrayed by Jean Arthur . When the group is taken on a tour of the city , the Berlin Wilder shows us is hideous , filled with rubble and the shells and half-shells of buildings . Frost , frantically taking notes , soon realizes with Iowan sensibility that the garbage isn't just on the surface as she sees soldiers fraternizing with Frauleins , and one woman rolling a baby buggy with an American flag attached . When two American soldiers mistake her for a Fraulein , Arthur plays along and winds up in an underground club , the Lorelei , where the star is Marlene Dietrich . Dietrich is a gorgeous woman who survived by picking up with a high-ranking Nazi official , and she's kept out of a labor camp now thanks to the protection of an army officer named Pringle , played by John Lund . When Lund romances Frost to keep her from investigating the matter , problems arise . Arthur and Dietrich are fantastic in their roles and play off each other magnificently . The casting is perfect : Two blonds , complete opposites , one worldly wise and one with a hand over her open mouth in shock , one oozing sex and the other oozing primness . Dietrich performs several numbers in her inimitable style , which is an added treat . This is Billy Wilder at his cynical best , with Pringle selling his birthday cake on the black market that Frost brings him from a constituent , and being slipped stockings for his girlfriend . He also shows how the Germans in charge bow down to Dietrich , knowing who she is . There are funny scenes , sexually overt scenes ( including a suggestion of S & M in the Dietrich-Lund relationship ) , and touching scenes in " A Foreign Affair . " Throughout , you will never be bored . This film also has the distinction of an ad-lib by John Lund that Wilder kept in the film : " Relax , baby , it's mother's day . " Relax , enjoy , and ponder - it's Billy Wilder .
494246	342623	29310	8.0	Brilliantly acted , moody psychological drama	" Night Must Fall , " which was originally a play by Emlyn Williams , contains three fantastic roles for actors , and as a film , it has been beautifully cast , directed ( by Richard Thorpe ) , and photographed . Set in an English cottage in a village that borders a forest , Rosalind Russell lives with her horrid , verbally abusive aunt . Along comes Danny , basically brought into the household to be spoken to about a promised marriage to one of the maids in the house . Danny is a sexual opportunist , a murderer , and a psychopath who can hone in on what each person he meets needs and wants . He soon becomes charmingly indispensable to the aunt . The Russell character senses his black soul but is attracted to him nonetheless , and he knows it . What transpires is an intriguing mystery and psychological drama . Robert Montgomery was a wonderful actor , adept at many kinds of roles but most often cast in the light comedies so often made in the ' 30s . Here he is fantastic - a charming , frightening liar with a huge ego who thinks his crafty mind will win in the end . Russell gives a beautiful , underplayed performance as an unhappy young woman , dating a man she's not sure she loves , attracted to this stranger and to the possibility of something interesting happening to her . Dame May Witty is great as an abrasive shrew . This is one of those gems - and doesn't Hollywood know it , they've remade it enough - but it's a real tour de force for the right actors . A winner .
494318	342623	55824	8.0	A man terrorizes a lawyer's family	Robert Mitchum seeks revenge against a witness who helped put him in prison in " Cape Fear , " a 1962 film starring Gregory Peck , Polly Bergen , Martin Balsam , Telly Savalas , Lori Martin and Barrie Chase . Mitchum , in probably his best role , plays the psychotic Max Cady , a man with an easy smile and laid back attitude who is pure evil . He is determined that Sam Bowden ( Peck ) , whose testimony in an assault case sent him up the river for 8 years , will pay for what he did via his family - his wife , Peggy , and his young daughter Nancy . Bowden is a distinguished attorney and gets some help from a police chief ( Balsam ) , but apparently during his time in stir , Cady studied the law . He goes so far and no further by being a menacing presence who does nothing . When Bowden takes the advice of a detective ( Savalas ) and has Cady beat up by some thugs , Cady gets the law on his side , and Bowden faces disbarment . His only hope is to catch Cady in the act . He comes with an elaborate plot to catch Cady before Nancy and Peggy are hurt . This is an excellent drama with a pivotal performance from Mitchum , who is fantastic as the disgusting Cady . Peck is very good , though perhaps too measured , as Bowden , and Polly Bergen lets out all the stops , particularly in her final scene with Cady , some of which was improvised by Mitchum . My only complaint is the predictability of Cady killing the family dog . Every time there's an animal in this type of film , you know it's doomed , and it gets tiresome . Someday perhaps a writer will be able to come up with something to replace this tired cliché . The beautiful Barrie Chase , the sensational dancer who performed with Fred Astaire on his television shows , has a nice role here as Cady's pick-up ; Lori Martin , who resembles Elizabeth Taylor and played her role in the TV series " National Velvet " is the daughter here . She is a mix of good looks , innocence , and youth which makes her particularly attractive to Cady . All in all , a tense , well-paced film with some genuinely terrifying moments and a genuinely terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum , which really makes the movie .
494738	342623	36723	8.0	Great Rita musical	Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a " Cover Girl " in this 1944 Technicolor film also starring Gene Kelly , Phil Silvers , Eve Arden , Lee Bowman , and Otto Kruger . Rita plays a beautiful showgirl , Rusty , working at a small club owned by the man she loves , Danny ( Kelly ) . Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius ( Silvers ) , the club comedian . They all hate oysters , but they're looking for a pearl . When they find one , all three of them will have good luck , they believe . Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner ( Kruger ) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved , who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother . Once she becomes the cover girl , the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true . Danny wants her to have her success , but at the same time realizes he's lost her . " Cover Girl " has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern , with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears . Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past . For such a sexy , desirable , gorgeous woman , she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men . None of this ever showed on screen , nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star . She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life . Gene Kelly is in a serious role here , but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing . Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend . This is a very good movie with no dull spots . The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves . When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg , who plays herself in the film , speaks of getting married , she's warned by her boss not to , that she's too necessary to the modeling business . We're not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club . Why couldn't she have had both ? Nevertheless , you can't beat " Cover Girl " for top entertainment , beautiful color , lovely music , great energy , fine performances , and its most fabulous asset , the glorious Rita Hayworth .
493762	342623	32520	8.0	I walked with a zombie	Bob Hope made some wonderful , fun movies in the ' 40s , and " The Ghost Breakers " costarring Paulette Goddard , Paul Lukas , Willie Best , and Richard Carlson is a prime example . Anthony Quinn has two small double roles in an early appearance for him . Hope is a radio gossip who talks about the mob and sometimes upsets them ; Goddard is a woman who has just inherited a castle in Cuba . The two intersect at a hotel after a shooting which Hope thinks he committed . He ends up in her trunk and therefore , in Cuba with her , along with Lukas , Best , and Carlson , an old friend of Goddard's . The castle is supposedly haunted , and some mighty strange things occur while Hope and Best investigate . This is a great haunted house mystery with Hope letting the zingers fly at a rapid pace . There was something about the younger Hope that is terribly appealing . He brings a boyishness and an energy to these ' 40s roles that was lost later on . Goddard is beautiful and lively , Lukas excellent as the mysterious Parada . Though there is some political incorrectness , Willie Best and Hope spar as equals . The film keeps a strong atmosphere , with the scenes of thunder and lightning in the beginning especially effective . And that haunted castle - yikes . Call a ghost breaker !
494222	342623	59319	8.0	Wonderful spy film	Michael Caine is Harry Palmer , the spy who came in to get out of the cold , in " The Ipcress File , " a non-Bond type spy film set in London . Filmed on location , it really captures the London of the ' 60s and the back office drudgery of the intelligence game . Caine is not your average spy , in fact , he's doing the job to keep from going to prison . But he's very well suited to it . In the first scenes , we see a guard put a scientist on a train , but he's forgotten his camera . When the guard returns to the train to give it to him , the scientist is gone and someone else is in his place . Thus begins the work of getting him back and ferreting out a double agent . The film , based on the Deighton novel , probably reflects the Profumo scandal that rocked Britain , and shows the smart , patriotic boys to be the Caines of the world and not the traitorous upper crust . Caine is excellent as Palmer - dry , funny , and clever , all the while cooking gourmet food , shopping for only the best , and listening to Mozart . He's a class act - the wrong class in a class-conscious society , but the best class to do the job that needs to be done .
493811	342623	110684	8.0	And yet ANOTHER great performance by Paul Newman	Paul Newman is " Nobody's Fool " in this 1994 film also starring Jessica Tandy , Bruce Willis , Melanie Griffith , Dylan Walsh and Philip Seymour Hoffman . Newman magnificently portrays Sully , a 60-year-old man living in a small town in upstate New York . He has a bad knee ; he's suing his boss , the hard living Carl Roebuck ( Bruce Willis ) for back wages ; he flirts with the boss ' wife Toby ( Melanie Griffith ) ; he rents from his old school teacher Beryl Peoples ( Jessica Tandy ) who depends on him ; he plays poker and drinks at the local bar ; and he plays the Trifecta every day . When his son Peter ( Dylan Walsh ) comes to town , Sully has to come face to face with the man he abandoned as a child , as well as his ex-wife . ( The scene where he sneaks out of her house as everyone screams at each other is a riot . ) He gets to know his little grandson , bonding with him as he never did the boy's father . Sully , who in his own way has been taking care of a lot of people in town - and driving some other ones crazy - learns the importance of a family connection and what it entails . A marvelous script , a marvelous cast , great direction by Robert Benton - " Nobody's Fool " is a small movie with a big message about life . Newman portrays Sully with all of his complexities . He's more a son to Beryl than her own son . He takes care of his workmate Grub ( Pruitt Taylor Vance ) as he never did his own son . He is there for Toby as she talks about Carl's infidelities , but he was never there for his own wife . What's most wonderful about the script is how character-driven it is and how all its messages come out of the characters . The audience is not beaten over the head with them . When Sully speaks bitterly about his late father , he turns to Peter and says , " That's what you'll say about me when I'm gone . " " You were gone , dad , " Peter says . " I've already said it . " Yet the two men try , without ever verbalizing that they are trying . He's there for Tandy , without a sentimental scene . Tandy is excellent as a woman who fears the loss of her independence , and fans of Nip / Tuck will get a kick out of seeing Dylan Walsh as he was 14 years ago with his mop of hair . He does very well in his role . Bruce Willis is amazing - relaxed , funny , cheating with a smile . Philip Seymour Hoffman , before stardom hit , has a hilarious role as a policeman trying to nail Sully and not having much luck . You can't really call what Newman does acting because you won't catch him doing it - he just IS Sully . He creates an unforgettable character in this must-see film .
494126	342623	106589	8.0	excellent later period Columbo	Faye Dunaway is the guest star of this marvelous Columbo , who seems to be entering into a flirtation with a beautiful socialite . This is a little off the beaten track for our sloppy detective friend as the lady even attempts to spiff him up with a new tie . The socialite has , with a partner , murdered her gigolo lover and attempted to cover up the true time of the killing , thereby providing an alibi for herself . She's very clever . So , of course , is Columbo . The Dunaway character is depending on Columbo's attraction to her to get away scott-free . This is a clever script with a marvelous performance by Dunaway , Claudia Christian , and the man himself , Peter Falk .
494049	342623	50306	8.0	Laughter and charm galore	Lauren Bacall is a " Designing Woman " in this vibrant , sophisticated 1957 comedy directed by Vincent Minnelli and starring Gregory Peck , Delores Gray , Sam Levene , Tom Helmore , Mickey Shaughnessy , Jesse White and Chuck Connors . Suggested by costume designer Helen Rose , this story of a designer marrying a sportswriter is a loose remake of " Woman of the Year " - two people meet , fall in love , marry hastily , and then discover that they're from different worlds . And Mike Hagen ( Peck ) comes with baggage - an ex-girlfriend ( Delores Gray ) who is starring in the show Mirella ( Bacall ) is doing the costumes for , plus he has mobsters after him because of a series of stories he's writing . It's a recipe for good fun , some beautiful ' 50s fashions and most of all , excellent acting by the entire cast . Bacall and Peck work beautifully together , both displaying wonderful comic timing , the highlight being the ravioli scene . Mickey Shaughnessy is hilarious as Max , the punch-drunk fighter , and Delores Gray is sexy and sings up a storm as performer Laurie Shannon . Minnelli keeps the pace moving and gives us a good taste of putting on a Broadway show and some of the personalities involved . Someone on the board mentioned that the Peck and Bacall looked as though they were having fun . Hopefully , that's true . This was made shortly before Humphrey Bogart's death - the film was actually released about 5 months after he died - and it's a tribute to Bacall's professionalism that she was able to pull off a comedy under such circumstances . I don't think her personal life could have been much fun at all .
494975	342623	32981	8.0	Lovely Christmas film	Though I don't like " Remember the Night " as much as " Christmas in Connecticut , " but it is a wonderfully warm Christmas film , notable for its Preston Sturgess script and the performances of the two leads , Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray . MacMurray plays a prosecutor , John Sargent , who is stuck with a shoplifting case right before Christmas . He manages to get the case delayed until the New Year , but Lee Leander ( Stanwyck ) , the shoplifter , complains that now she won't have a warm jail to spend Christmas in . He learns she's from a town that's on his way home , so he offers to drop her . That doesn't quite work out - her mother doesn't want her - so she winds up coming home to his family - his mom ( Beulah Bondi ) , his aunt ( Elizabeth Patterson ) and their handyman ( Sterling Holloway ) . It's there that she experiences a true family and real love . Before the week is over , Lee and John have fallen for one another . I always assumed , from " My Three Sons , " that Fred MacMurray was a capable actor , and kind of ordinary . Watching his various performances on TCM has changed that impression . Here he's relaxed , natural and very likable , and has his usual good chemistry with Stanwyck . She's wonderful - tough yet vulnerable . I have a feeling the ending was dictated by the Hayes Code , but this is still a good movie . Preston Sturgess didn't think so - he didn't like the cuts , so this was the last film he wrote and didn't direct .

"	Billy Crudup is a " Stage Beauty " in the 2004 film costarring Claire Danes , Rupert Everett , Tom Wilkinson , Ben Chaplin , Zoe Tapper and Richard Griffiths . Based on the writings of Samuel Pepys about a stage actor named Ned Kynaston ( Crudup ) , the plot centers around the repeal of an English law forbidding women on the stage during the time of King Charles II , 1660 . The shining star in the female roles is Ned Kynaston who essays Ophelia , Desdemona , Juliet et al . to the enthusiastic approval of audiences and in particular , an audience of one , his lover , The Duke of Buckingham ( Chaplin ) . Because he is in such great demand , Kynaston's boss Betterton ( Wilkinson ) has given him cast approval . With Kynaston's head getting too big for his wigs , he insults Sir Charles Sedley , who tries to pick him up thinking he's a woman ( but not at all put off when he learns he's a man ) , and Sedley conspires to get revenge . Then Kynaston insults Nell Gwynn ( Tapper ) , the King's mistress , by not approving of women performing on stage . Before you can say " Desdemona , " the law has been repealed . His dresser Maria ( Claire Danes ) adores and admires Ned , aspires to be an actress , and has performed Desdemona in an illegal Othello done in a tavern . Sir Charles manages to bring her to the attention of the theater while taking Kynaston out of commission by beating the pulp out of him ( with the help of two fans whom Kynaston also insulted ) . When Ned recovers enough to attempt to get his job back , he finds he's no longer in demand , his dresser is a star , his lover is getting married and , having fantasized that Ned was a woman while they made love , no longer wants him . But he has one friend left - a most unlikely supporter . This is a wonderful , richly produced film marvelously written by Jeffrey Hatcher and directed by Richard Eyre that tells of the journey each of us has to our true identity - not just who we are as people but our gender identity as well . Without female costumes , wigs , and mannerisms , Ned doesn't know who or what he is . In love with Ned and hating him at the same time , Maria doesn't know if she's a good actress or not ( she isn't ) . When she asks Mr . Pepys if she was good on opening night , he tells her the truth , " There was no comparison , " as she's the first woman to act on stage . " She did what she did first ; you did what you did last , " Betterton tells Kynaston . Working together , they find their true souls - not just in each other , but in themselves . The Bible says " male and female He created them . " Thinking about this line in the context of " Stage Beauty , " I like to think that we each possess male and female qualities . Ned searches not only for his maleness but just as importantly , how to express himself artistically as a male . Impersonating a female was to him a very high art - he feels there is no way to be creative now . He also has to learn about his sexuality - I suppose some people will feel that Ned has been " made straight . " Not at all . He has instead become a whole person , and that whole person is better able to encompass his entire sexuality . The brilliant , exciting end of the film is much like the creative process but instead of flowering as it is nurtured , it explodes in a thrilling collaboration . The performances right down the line are fantastic . Billy Crudup is not only a total Adonis but an amazing actor with a perfect British accent and handle on the dialogue to match his perfect face - he is equally convincing as the confused Ned , the mannered Desdemona and the brutal Othello . As Maria , Claire Danes is a match for him - subservient dresser , serious actress , star , friend and lover , and with a British accent that , like Crudup's , is so totally organic , one could easily believe she is British . The rest of the cast is breathtaking , making each role a gem . I can't even single any one actor out ; each not only created a wonderful character , but were not in any way slighted by the writer . Some of the dialogue in this film is as hilarious as other dialogue in it is poignant . I'd love to know where this film was during Oscar time . Apparently it did not have the huge studio behind it that " Shakespeare in Love " enjoyed , which is a pity , because it deserved to be singled out for many of the top awards - acting in every category , directing , writing , and costumes . I see it won " Overlooked Film of the Year " somewhere . This is a jewel that definitely fell out of the Oscar crown .
494741	342623	408306	9.0	The human side of warring factions	First , on a light note , I saw " Road to Perdition " right before I saw this film , and therefore made the conclusion that Daniel Craig is in every film made . At this point , I feel like I know his face better than one of my family members . " Munich " is a powerful story done by a powerhouse group , as it is directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner . It's the story of a young Israeli , Avner ( Eric Bana ) , who is asked to head up a team with the mission to eliminate the men responsible for the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics . The situation is re-enacted but real television news clips are used throughout the beginning of the film . Though he has a wife and their first child is on the way , Avner accepts the assignment , which takes him all over the world tracking down and killing the miscreants . When his assignment comes to an end , he finds he is unable to shake his experiences . " Munich " demonstrates , in the form of Avner and his team , the disintegration of those qualities that make us human beings in the first place . These men believe in what they're doing but become disillusioned - can they all be trusted ? Whom can they trust ? What is the point of , as one of them puts it , " all this blood " when the people they kill are replaced with worse people ? In the beginning , Avner clearly has no affection for killing - he watches , horrified , as it goes on . The team is careful not to hurt civilians - for instance , they protect a little girl , the daughter of one of the Black September planners , from a bomb intended for her father . Later , Avner's orders are " just do it , " and there are bodies of innocent victims everywhere . Avner pays a man named Louis huge money for information on the whereabouts of the Black September men - and then begins to doubt him - is he in turn telling the other side his whereabouts because he has become a target ? I agree that Spielberg does not take sides in the film and shows how everyone suffers in any violent conflict , and that after a time , people hate for the sake of hating and kill for the sake of killing , often forgetting what started the whole cycle . Eric Bana gives a fantastic performance as Avner . He looks so different at the end of the film than at the beginning , as he becomes increasingly more paranoid . He is particularly frightening in the scene where he is making love to his wife and reliving what he's been through . One really feels the harrowing experiences he's had and what it has done to his spirit . A thought-provoking and sobering film .
494520	342623	40338	9.0	A little boy thinks the butler did it	A little boy ( Bobby Henry ) thinks he saw a murder in " The Fallen Idol , " a 1948 film directed by Carol Reed from a Graham Greene screenplay . You really can't get much better than that . Phillipe is the son of the French ambassador to England and his good buddy in the large place where they live is the butler Baines ( Ralph Richardson ) . Baines and his shrew of a wife ( Sonia Dresdel ) run the place , and the action takes place while both the ambassador and his wife are away . Being an only child , Phillipe has a vivid imagination and is also very attached to Baines , whom he follows one day to a coffee shop . There , Baines is in deep conversation with a woman he introduces as his niece Julie ( Michelle Morgan ) . In actuality , she's his girlfriend , and she and Baines are discussing whether or not he can get a divorce from his wife . When Mrs . Baines leaves to visit her aunt , Julie comes over to the house to spend time with Baines and Phillipe . Just one small problem - Mrs . B knows something is up and is still in the house . When she winds up dead at the bottom of the stairs , Baines falls under suspicion , and Phillipe is afraid Baines killed her . This is a beautifully crafted film about the mind of a child and about secrets and lies . Baines tells Phillipe secrets and lies , Julie tells Phillipe secrets , Mrs . Baines tells Phillipe secrets , Phillipe can't keep a secret , so lies ensue . When the inspector ( Jack Hawkins ) shows up , it becomes exhausting all around . One of the biggest stars of the film is the camera , which takes us down a London street as a little boy runs in the dark and rain ; up a long staircase ; through a game of hide and seek with covered furniture ; the boy's view of the busy household ; and most especially the precious final shot . The magnificent Ralph Richardson portrays the complex Baines perfectly - unhappily married , in love with the beautiful Julie , afraid of his nasty wife , efficient at his job and fond of Phillipe , who is at this point clearly in the way . Michelle Morgan is believable as Julie , a kind young woman - these aren't two nasty , conniving people , just two people in love who don't know whether to go forward or separate . Bobby Henry is an excellent Phillipe . He's not sweet and adorable , but we don't want Mrs . Baines to be mean to him ; he blows every secret all to hell and doesn't lie very well ; he shows up at inappropriate moments ; he makes the wrong assumptions - but we feel for his terror and confusion . If he'd been cute , it would have made Baines and Julie seem more exploitive than they were . It also would have made Mrs . Baines seem even meaner - but she's mean enough . One of the best films to come out of British cinema , and more proof of the greatness of Carol Reed . A must see .
494228	342623	455902	9.0	biography of a Hollywood beauty	Linda Darnell was certainly one of the most beautiful women to hit Hollywood , but when she first came on the scene , she was just a girl . This Biography episode covers the actress ' tragic life , using home movies , film clips , and interviews with family , friends , and costars . Linda Darnell's story is compelling and quite sad : Chaotic home , absent father , pushy stage mother , and a Hollywood contract at 14 after a series of beauty pageants . When Zanuck found out her age , he sent her back home , only to sign her again while she was still a teen , when he realized that RKO was going to give her a contract . She was put into adult roles immediately and soon became a huge success in Stardust , The Mark of Zorro , Blood and Sand , and many others . When she married cinematographer Peverell Marley , many years her senior , Zanuck fired him and put Linda on suspension because she wasn't a sweet virgin anymore . She came back , and when she did , she was hotter than ever as a sultry beauty , and some of her best films followed : Unfaithfully Yours , Letter to Three Wives , My Darling Clementine , No Way Out , etc . But a volatile marriage , alcohol , bad investments , and a devastating affair with Joseph Mankiewicz left her bloated and broke . Bad marriages and a bad nightclub act followed . Stage work brought Linda the confidence she had lost and also reconciled her with her adopted daughter Lola , and when she made her first film in 7 years , the offers started pouring in . Unfortunately , Linda's third go in the movies was not to be . After watching Stardust at her former secretary's house in Chicago , the house caught fire , and Linda died after suffering burns on 90 % of her body . She died beautiful , excited about the future , and with the memory of the earlier teen Linda with her whole life ahead of her . This is truly a heartbreaking story , very well told , and one not to miss .
493573	342623	105691	9.0	Wonderful film	Liam Neeson is " Under Suspicion " for murdering his wife and a client in this 1991 little known film also starring Laura San Giacomo . This is one of those films one rents and all too rarely realizes that they have found an unsung treasure . Set in England in 1959-60 , Neeson plays an police officer , Tony Aaron . While on assignment with his partner Frank guarding the home of a wealthy man who is out of town , Tony takes time out to have a dalliance with the owner's wife . In the fray that erupts when he's nearly caught by her husband , another officer is killed . Tony is pressured to resign and when he leaves , he only has one friend left - his partner Frank . Tony becomes a low-life private detective who helps clients fake adultery in order to have grounds for divorce . To do this , Tony uses his own wife , Hazel , the woman of the above dalliance , as the " other woman . " One night , he does the usual thing of entering the hotel room with a camera and surprising the client and Hazel in bed when he discovers that both have been brutally murdered . He immediately becomes a suspect , though he trails along with his ex-partner during the investigation and discovers some other suspects - not only who had a reason to knock off the artist , but who had plenty of reason to frame Tony for the crime . This is a very well produced and directed film with brilliant construction . The detail in evoking the atmosphere of the late ' 50s is wonderful , and if there were ever a film that deserved a " best costumes " nomination for an Oscar , this is it . The acting is all around very good , with a good deal of the film's budget going to Liam Neeson , who back then was a prolific actor two years from superstardom . Neeson is terrific as a loser who has made one mistake after another so that a noose around his neck seems appropriate . Yet there's something likable about him , and earnest , too , so that the audience feels that though he may not have been able to keep his pants zipped , at heart he's not a bad guy . Laura San Giacomo , who has enjoyed an okay film career but is now best known for her work in the TV series " Just Shoot Me " is very effective as the mysterious mistress whom Tony suspects may have had something to do with her boyfriend's murder . Kenneth Cranham , a very familiar face in British productions , is excellent as Tony's loyal ex-partner , who risks his own job protecting his friend . An absolutely gorgeous woman , Alphonsia Emmanuel , plays Stasio's wife and does a good job in a role that , were she not so beautiful , would probably not have been noticed . Any film that has me yelling out loud at the screen at 3 a . m . is a good movie in my book . That's the level of suspense that " Under Suspicion " has - if you have a weak heart , take medication first . It's absolutely thrilling .
493539	342623	805669	9.0	A lot of fun and heart	" Ugly Betty " is a refreshing show from ABC that is based on a soap opera , I believe from Mexico . The place and the characters are quite similar to " The Devil Wears Prada , " except that in " Ugly Betty " her boss loves her . Like Prada , UB takes place in the offices of a fancy fashion magazine a la Vogue , in the series called Mode , and we come into the show shortly after the death of its former editor-in-chief , " Faye . " Mode's owner , Bradford Meade ( Alan Dale ) has put his son Daniel ( Eric Mabius ) in Faye's place instead of the ambitious Wilhemina ( Vanessa Williams ) so much of the plot is taken up with Wilhemina trying to discredit him with the help of her assistant , a bitchy queen named Marc ( Michael Urie ) . Wilhemina has something cooked up with a masked woman whom we are led to believe is Faye returned to life , and they are trying to link Bradford with Faye's death and thus take control of the company . Into this maelstrom comes Betty ( America Ferrera ) with her ponchos , braces , glasses and hideous clothes , saving Daniel's job week after week and bolstering his ego . The other part of the series concerns Betty's home life with her Mexican-American father ( Tony Plana ) , her street-smart sister Hilda ( Ana Ortiz ) and Hilda's fashionista son ( Mark Indelicato ) . Though the show has great warmth , it is in the family scenes where not only warmth but a sense of reality reigns . All of the roles are perfectly cast . The show has clichéd characters , but they're supposed to be - it's part of the fun . Certainly Michael Urie is capable of playing a much more subtle character than the outrageous Marc , but the magazine is supposed to be an environment of total shallowness and political intrigue where Betty is the only real person . When asked why , when going to a Breast Cancer event , Wilhemina is wearing an AIDS red ribbon and not a pink one , she answers , " The AIDS one looks better with what I'm wearing . " What " Ugly Betty " has going for it is lots of heart . Betty's open , outgoing and friendly attitude breaks down barriers in the office and keeps the family grounded at home . The message is , just be who you are and be proud of it .
494032	342623	66997	9.0	engrossing documentary about the great director	John Ford is one of our greatest American directors , and he is profiled in this 1971 documentary that features a hilarious interview with the man himself ( Interviewer : How did you shoot that scene ? Ford : With a camera ) and actors who worked with him many times over the years : John Wayne , James Stewart , Henry Fonda , and Maureen O'Hara . Narrated by Orson Welles , prominent directors talk about his influence on cinema and his gifts as a director : Martin Scorcese , Peter Bogdanovich , Steven Spielberg , and Clint Eastwood . The most fascinating part of this documentary was the discussion - with clips - of how the master framed his shots like a painter , and the scenes shown were truly stunning . The end of the documentary speaks to his sentimentality , belief in an afterlife and the family , demonstrated with heartwrenching scenes from " The Searchers , " " How Green was My Valley , " and others . Finally there was a taped meeting between Katharine Hepburn and Ford in the year he died . The two had a great connection and perhaps even a relationship . It is most fascinating , particularly when Ford's son leaves the room and mistakenly leaves the tape recorder on . Excellent all the way around .
494313	342623	363473	9.0	a one man band	Kevin Spacey is everything , including Bobby Darin , in " Beyond the Sea , " a biography of the young man who set himself up as the next Sinatra - and indeed , might have been - had it not been for his early death . Darin was a cocky kid with a great presence and oodles of talent . The essence of Vegas cool , his singing style was as slick as it was thrilling , and in his short career he had many hits , " Beyond the Sea " being just one . His rendition of " Mack the Knife " is classic . Spacey portrays Bobby in this exuberant film that celebrates the life of this great singer . He directed , produced , and contributed to the script as well . His motives for making this film were several-fold - he wanted people to remember Darin's music and talent , and he probably wanted to showcase his own remarkable abilities , as he does his own singing . Though the structure is a bit jarring at times , this is a wonderful movie , filled with fantastic music and musical numbers that absolutely soar . Spacey's voice is fantastic , and he copies Darin's style beautifully . The music makes " Beyond the Sea " a real feast . Darin's real-life story is also compelling . Like Sinatra , he never accepted second-best for himself and moved fast , knowing that he had been living on borrowed time since he was 15 due to a heart condition . After a family secret is revealed , he never really bounced back and died when he was 36 . Much has been written about Spacey's age and that this is a vanity production . Spacey tried to get financing for this movie for something like ten years ; after the death of his mother , it finally happened , and he believes that she helped him get the film produced . So " Beyond the Sea " meant a great deal to him , and kudos to Spacey for having a dream and not giving it up . We should applaud someone who doesn't quit instead of writing him off with , this is a vanity production . Despite his excellent performance , Spacey's age gets in the way . In my own opinion , this was completely unnecessary . I assume he allowed it to happen because he figured he was just too old and everyone was going to have to live with it . Inexcusable . This is no small budget movie , and we're talking about the Land of Illusion here . Certainly some attention to lighting , a softer lens , better makeup and some face tape could have easily removed 10 years from Spacey . Orson Welles had to live down the fact that he wasn't as handsome as he appeared in parts of " Citizen Kane " because of the flawless way he looked . The time and care taken to light and make up actresses is legendary . I can't believe , as one who has been before the cameras and in the hands of makeup and lighting people myself , that some years couldn't have been knocked off of Spacey's appearance . The rest of the performances are very good , with Greta Scacchi a standout as Sandra Dee's pushy mother . Kate Bosworth is good as Dee and , in this writer's opinion , prettier . " Beyond the Sea " is a first class production all around . As one who remembers Darin , it's heavenly - and a reminder that heaven robbed us of a significant talent way too early .
494859	342623	36969	9.0	Beautiful adaptation	Orson Welles hauls out his " Citizen Kane " corsets to become Mr . Rochester to Joan Fontaine's Jane Eyre in " Jane Eyre , " a lavish 1944 adaptation of the book by Charlotte Bronte . Jane is a poor orphan shuttled from one horrible situation to another - first the home of her cruel aunt ( Agnes Moorhead ) , then to an orphanage run by Henry Brocklehurst . He announces to all that Jane is possessed by the devil and that no one should be involved with her . But one little girl , Helen Burns , played by an absolutely beautiful Elizabeth Taylor , befriends her . Alas , due to the inhumane treatment at the orphanage , Helen dies . With the help of the kind doctor to the orphans , Dr . Rivers ( handsome John Sutton ) Jane sticks it out at the orphanage to receive her education . When they offer her a teaching position there for pennies , she leaves to become the governess for little Adele ( Margaret O'Brien ) at Thornfield , the home of the mysterious , tormented Edward Rochester . O'Brien was one of the most adorable child actors in films , and one of the best performers . Welles couldn't stand her because she was a scene stealer . Mary Astor confessed being afraid of her on " Meet Me in St . Louis . " It's all lost on the audience , as she is wonderful . Welles made a calculated decision to hire himself out as an actor to finance his film work . He makes a magnificent Mr . Rochester - romantic , angry , and magnetic . His resonant voice speaks the dialogue with conviction , and , at 27 , he was able , with a little help , to cut a dashing figure , an advantage that didn't last too much longer . Fontaine is perfect as the subservient , shy , unloved Jane , her soft , plain appearance and breathless voice giving an overall air of dignity and true beauty - at once recognized by Mr . Rochester . There is , however , the matter of Grace Poole . The film is atmospheric - in fact , it may be a tad on the overdone side , but the wind blowing on the moors , the storms , the lightning , the mausoleum-like , cold house all fit the darkness of Mr . Rochester's soul to perfection . Truly there was no one in cinema history quite like Orson Welles - brilliant , eccentric , a profligate spender , and ultimately self-destructive , on the outs with Hollywood and unable to finish any of his later projects . The saddest thing in his biography is the dinner he has with Steven Spielberg , whose help he wants in getting a distributor . Spielberg instead approaches him like a fan and wants to talk about the great films , the great performances , and no offer of help is forthcoming . How heartbreaking for Welles to spend the next 40 years of his life competing with his old dazzling image .
495096	342623	58756	9.0	A delight !	Two teenage girls stalk a pianist in " The World of Henry Orient , " a 1964 film starring Peter Sellars , Angela Lansbury , Phyllis Thaxter , Tom Bosley , Paula Prentiss , Merrie Spaeth and Tippy Walker . Spaeth and Walker are the 14-year-old teens , and the writing for them isn't good - it's PERFECT , capturing what it's like to be that age and having your first crush . The object of their affections is vain , paranoid Henry Orient ( Peter Sellars ) a pianist who apparently specializes in somewhat ugly modern music whom the girls see kissing his married girlfriend ( Prentiss ) in the park . When they see him again , he recognizes them and becomes unnerved . Then they attend a concert - - he sees them from the stage and nearly goes into orbit . After that , the girls read all they can about him and start staking out his apartment and restaurants he frequents . The Prentiss character , Stella , lives in fear of her husband finding out about her non-affair - she refuses to go to Orient's apartment , and whenever she acquiesces , she ends up running out of the back of the restaurant while he's getting a cab . Finally Henry gets her to his place . He spots the girls outside , and Stella becomes convinced that her husband has hired two child detectives . The kids have told a storekeeper next to their stalking stoop that they're waiting for their mother , Jayne Mansfield , who has been kidnapped . It goes from there - and it's HILARIOUS . The teens are sensational , giggly , wildly imaginative and creative , swooning , and faking terminal illness and other events on the street as they race all over the gloriously photographed New York City . Val comes from a super-rich family and neglectful parents , played by the glamorous Angela Lansbury and Tom Bosley as her quiet , hard-working husband . Her story , despite all the humor , is a poignant one . Sellars is fantastic , sporting an odd accent , and using the most subtle of expressions and body language to show what he's thinking . Lansbury is terrific and looks great , Bosley is excellent , and Prentiss is a riot as a neurotic mess . But the young girls - what memories they brought back of fantasy , crushes , wild laughter , pranks , and complete devastation . Phenomenal direction by George Roy Hill , gorgeous cinematography , great music . A no-miss if you want to recapture days of record albums , sitting on your bedroom floor with your friends , scrapbooks dedicated to the love of your life , hating teachers , and complete , uninhibited , euphoric daring .
493473	342623	39661	10.0	obscure but memorable	It is totally amazing , nearly 60 years later , to realize the lengths that 20th Century Fox went to in order to keep Tyrone Power a handsome leading man rather than letting him show his stuff . It's no wonder Fox came to disgrace during the Cleopatra era . Pity it didn't happen earlier so Power had more opportunities to show his acting range . Nightmare Alley was a favorite of mine from the time I was a teenager - a film Power fought to make and one that the studio never publicized and released as a B film . Spiteful bunch , considering the money he had made for them ! Power , Blondell , Gray , Helen Walker , and the marvelous Ian Keith turn in great performances in a gritty film somewhat ahead of its time for its unrelenting toughness , its hard view of alcoholism , a look inside the world of mentalists and carnival life , and its theme of the supernatural . It is reminiscent of " Ace in the Hole " and some of the later , cynical Wilder films . Power was one of those actors whose drop dead gorgeous appearance kept him from some excellent roles , thanks to his studio . He sometimes could appear rigid ( though not in this film ) but someone I knew saw him in a Broadway play and said it was like being alone in a room with him , he had such magnetism . We have so few examples of his really great work - the recording of John Brown's Body is one , this film is another - it's great that it's now out on DVD and available to the public .
494104	342623	416320	10.0	A furtive tear	As much as I have always appreciated Woody Allen comedies , I admit to liking more the dramas where he asks the tough questions . The brilliant " Match Point , " like " Crimes and Misdemeanors " is one of those , and it's his best . Loosely based on " A Place in the Sun , " Allen's tough question is , " Would you rather be good or lucky ? " " Is there such a thing as luck ? " Many believe that people " make their own luck . " But Allen's premise is that , when it's all over , luck plays a huge part in all of our lives . He uses the analogy of a tennis ball - when you serve a ball and it lands on the net , it can topple over to the other side , and you win , or fall on the same side , and you lose . What a perfect analogy to tell the story of Chris ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) , a former professional tennis player . He becomes the tennis teacher at a British club and meets Tom Hewett , a young man from a filthy rich family . Chris is embraced by Hewett's family and begins dating Tom's sister Chloe . Then he sees Tom's fiancé , Nola , played by Scarlett Johannson , and becomes obsessed with her . This is an amazing film - absolutely nothing happens for a while , and yet everything happens . The story is punctuated with old , scratchy Caruso records and operatic selections from " Macbeth , " " Otello , " and others . We watch the characters living their lives , including their work , romantic entanglements , and marital problems . We watch them evolve , grow happy or unhappy , contented or restless , all leading up to the point where something does happen . When it does , it's ferocious . The ending will knock your socks off . It goes nowhere you think it's going . The film manages to keep you constantly off-balance and misinterpreting what you think you're seeing . The last time I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers , he was giving a marvelous portrayal of Elvis Presley , despite the fact that his height and frame are somewhat slighter than the King's . A beautiful young man , he has an interior dialogue going throughout the film . We don't hear it ; we see it on his face . Scarlet Johannson is gorgeous and sexy as Nola , a cool blond in the Lana Turner tradition who is the object of his desire . Of all the characters in the film , her character goes through the most change , and she's very effective . There are no easy answers to the questions Allen asks in " Crimes and Misdemeanors , " " Stardust Memories , " " Bullets over Broadway , " and " Match Point . " Allen leaves open what will happen emotionally as a result of the events of this film . But the verse of " Una Furtiva Lagrima , " ( A secret tear ) played several times during the film despite a bad skip in the recording means " For just one moment the beating Of her hot pulse could be felt ! With her sighing confounding Momentarily my sighs ! Oh God , I shall expire ; I can't ask for more . " Significantly , it is heard at the beginning of the film and at the end . Just remember - the record skips .
493580	342623	43014	10.0	The ultimate has-been in the ultimate Hollywood story	William Holden is Joe Gillis , a down and out screenwriter trying to keep his car from being repossessed in " Sunset Boulevard , " a 1950 film written and directed by Billy Wilder . The film stars Gloria Swanson , Max von Stroheim , Nancy Olson , Jack Webb , and Cecil B . Demille . Gillis hides his car in a garage , not realizing it is the home of the great silent film star , the delusional Norma Desmond ( Swanson ) , who lives in this enormous mansion , cared for by her butler ( von Stroheim ) . Finding out he is a screenwriter , Norma solicits his help in editing her script of " Salome , " her comeback film . Feeling somewhat trapped at first , Joe eventually enjoys the good life . When he slips away to be with his friends on New Year's Eve , his friend's fiancée , Betty Schaefer ( Olson ) suggests a screenplay based on a story written by Joe . ( The story actually was a script by Wilder , filmed in Germany . ) He returns to the Sunset Boulevard mansion to learn that Norma , distraught over his leaving , has attempted suicide . Taking pity on her , Joe becomes her lover and moves from the garage into the big house . Meanwhile , he's falling for Betty and slipping away to work with her at night . This is perhaps the greatest Hollywood story , and yet it didn't get off to a very good start . The first scene took place in a morgue , where the dead bodies talked to one another . At the first screening , the audience laughed , which they weren't supposed to be doing . As Wilder sat on the steps outside , a woman walked out and , unaware of who he was , said , " Have you ever seen such ? x @ / / & ? " " And we had worked on it for a year , " Wilder told an interviewer . So the opening was cut . Wilder captures the ego and delusional aspects of Desmond perfectly , a woman caught in the past who has lost all sense of reality . This role provided silent film star Gloria Swanson with her great comeback . With her royal demeanor , sharp voice and gorgeous eyes , Swanson actually plays the role like a silent star , in a very overt way . The truth is , Norma never left not only her stardom , but her film roles . At the time of the filming , Swanson was 52 playing a has-been of 50 . By today's standards , it's somewhat amusing , and you'd probably add 20 years if you were doing it today . In fact , in the Broadway show , the line " There's nothing wrong with being 50 " was cut . Wilder approached Mae West , Pola Negri and Mary Pickford for Norma before Swanson . " Sunset Boulevard " may have given Swanson her comeback , but it made William Holden a superstar . After his starring role in " Golden Boy , " Holden disappeared into light films and basically went nowhere until Joe Gillis . He is remembered today as one of the great stars of the ' 50s , yet he was of the same generation as many of the stars of the ' 30s and ' 40s . He is glorious looking - you wouldn't have to be a loony tune to lock him up in your house . He plays the role with the right touch of cynicism and self-hatred . Montgomery Clift was set to play this role but dropped out . He , too , would have been excellent but probably not as hard-hitting . von Stroheim , as Norma's protector and butler Max , is perfection . In real life , he couldn't drive , so the car needed to be towed ; in the scene where he drives up to Paramount , he actually crashed through the gates . In the film , Norma , thinking that Demille wants her for a role , goes to Paramount and visits him on the set of " Samson and Delilah , " and " Sunset Boulevard " uses the real filming of that movie and its cast . As a Broadway show , " Sunset Boulevard " was opulent but much less effective . There wasn't enough music ( the second act had one new song ) but provided a tremendous showcase and two great numbers for the various women who played Norma . Stephen Sondheim had at one time entertained doing this as a musical ; in his hands , it would have captured the dark atmosphere of the film much better . Billy Wilder gives us a biting portrait of actors who live for nothing but their stardom , their hangers-on for whom they are just a meal ticket , and the sadness of being aged and forgotten in Hollywood . A great classic starring the greats , written and directed by one . It doesn't get any better than this .
494105	342623	86619	10.0	Beautiful , touching , and funny film	Barbra Streisand directed , produced , co-wrote and starred in " Yentl , " the story of a young woman who wants to study the Talmud but can't because she's a woman living in middle Europe in 1908 . However , she is secretly taught by her father who encourages and appreciates her intelligence at a time when all a woman was supposed to do was wait on her husband hand and foot . When he dies , she takes off , disguised as a boy , so that she can study . Along the way , she meets an engaged couple , played by Mandy Patinkin ( Avigdor ) and Amy Irving ( Hadass ) . She falls in love with Avigdor . WhenHadass ' family finds out that Patinkin's brother committed suicide , they call off the wedding , as he is now considered to be from a bad family . To help him out , Yentl , still disguised as a man , agrees to marry Hadass . Under Jewish law , because two men are like or are brothers , if one dies , the other has an obligation to marry the widow . The plan is that at some point , Anshel ( Yentl's boy name ) will disappear . This is a sumptuous production - absolutely beautiful . The studio wanted Streisand to sing , but she didn't see this film as a musical . Instead , the music is performed as a series of inner monologues , and it's very effective . Some of the scenes are very funny - when " Anshel " has to sleep in the same bed as the Patinkin character ; when he wants Anshel to go swimming in the nude - and of course , the wedding night ! Barbara Streisand makes an adorable , albeit small young man , and gives a touching performance . Also , her comic timing is excellent . Fantastic performances are turned in by Mandy Patinkin , the beautiful and delicate Amy Irving , and Steven Hill . The very gifted Barbra Streisand is often the subject of backlash , as many powerful women often are , but the fact that some people don't like her ( and I wouldn't describe myself as a rabid fan ) doesn't change what a staggering achievement this is for a first-time director . When Orson Welles did this , he was revered . It took Streisand15 years to get this made , but she finally did , and it is an excellent film , a wonderful tribute to fathers and an inspiration to young women . We live at a time and in a country where there are so many possibilities . Streisand should not be criticized for taking advantage of them .
494141	342623	59712	10.0	An all-star cast en route to Germany as Hitler takes power	" Ship of Fools " it may be , but it is also a Ship of Stars : Oskar Werner , Vivien Leigh , Lee Marvin , Simone Signoret , Jose Ferrer , Elizabeth Ashley , George Segal , and Michael Dunn . Directed by Stanley Kramer , this 1965 film deals with a German ship heading to its port in Bremerhaven in 1933 and the lives of some of its passengers . Dunn speaks to the audience at the beginning and end of the film , telling us at first that it is a ship of fools and that we may find ourselves in some of the characters . This is one of the best all-star casts ever assembled , right up there with " All About Eve " and " The Long , Hot Summer . " The performances are as magnificent as the film is relentlessly depressing , with a Jewish man put at a table with a dwarf , while at the captain's table , another man preaches about the new Germany and extermination of Jews , the elderly , and those who are not fit . The optimistic Jew thinks Germany owes the Jews a great deal and vice versa , and with 1 million Jews there , certainly no one is going to kill all of them . A drug-addicted woman is being deported to an island , and the very ill ship's doctor falls in love with her and is tempted to give up his miserable life to care for her . A couple with a passionate sex life finds they are poles apart in every other way . A bitter , middle-aged woman comes to grips with her loneliness and tries to drink it away . And on and on , on the ship of fools . By the end of the film , looking at the Jew's beautiful family on the dock , the viewer is ready to reach for a razor blade . Oskar Werner ( Tyrone Power's son-in-law ) gives a magnificent performance as a man discouraged about his life full of obligations , exhausted from ill health , and reaching out for one last chance at happiness . Simone Signoret , who falls for the doctor , is a warm and sympathetic countess , nervous about her future , her past dried up . Lee Marvin , as a southern drunk who wants to get laid , is perfection - Vivien Leigh herself was impressed with him . " What's this about the Jews ? " he asks her . " I never saw a Jew until I was 15 . " " Perhaps you were too busy lynching Negroes to care about the Jews , " she replies . For Vivien Leigh , Scarlett is far behind her - 26 years behind her , in fact , with almost no vestige of her left due to Leigh's battles with manic-depression and the dissolution of her marriage to Laurence Olivier . As Scarlett herself would have said , " That girl doesn't exist anymore . " Her character is the Blanche Dubois who didn't go to the asylum and some years later takes a cruise . Even the last gown she wears , as she dances the Charleston , is reminiscent of Blanche . It's a great performance as a beautiful woman who has seen better days and is disillusioned and bitter about men , love , and romance . Her big scenes at the end of the film - in the hallway and with Marvin - are fantastic . I have to believe , though " Ship of Fools " is downbeat , that it leaves us with some hope . Dunn , as the dwarf philosopher , is too smart to stick around Germany once things heat up ; perhaps his Jewish friend will see the light before it's too late . The Countess is a survivor ; no reason she shouldn't survive the island . But for all of them , a certain way of life has ended , and there won't be going back . One of the great films of the ' 60s .
493639	342623	380673	10.0	Whatever you write about me , don't make it sad	Though the above summary comment was a request that Rita made of the press , the life of one of the world's most charismatic and glorious looking stars comes off as being just that - sad . For all the joy she gave the world and continues to give it , there should have been a lot more personal joy in the story of Rita Hayworth . This is a wonderful documentary because it incorporates the memories of Rita's family as well as friends and coworkers . She was obviously a warm and loving person but probably someone who would have been content as a wife and mother . Certainly her children brought her great happiness . The biographical film emphasizes her attraction to manipulative , controlling men , attributing this to her being her father's dance partner and his dance student from a young age . Though not mentioned , it has been brought up elsewhere that Rita and her father often registered as husband and wife when they toured as dancers and shared a bed . If this is so , the root of her problems can be traced to this abusive relationship . Rita , however , remained a devoted daughter to both of her parents as well as a loving sister to her two brothers . She was unable to have a happy marriage , though she certainly fell in love with both Orson Welles and Prince Aly Kahn before moving on to loser Dick Haymes , who almost cost her her children , and James Hill , who , like Haymes , was apparently abusive . Her first husband , Edward Judson , viewed her as an investment only , and according to publicist Henry Rogers , was furious when she had an affair with Anthony Quinn during the filming of " Blood and Sand " - not because she was having an affair , but because she was having an affair with someone who wasn't in a position to do anything for her career . The first signs of Alzheimer's began to show in the early ' 60s , and when she died in 1987 , she was bedridden and knew no one . So this is a great documentary if only to show that great beauty and talent do not confer a great life , and that what you see on the screen very often is real , honest-to-goodness acting . Because no doubt about it , through life's unhappiness , Rita Hayworth was a true goddess . With that face , voice , body , smile , hair , her magnificent and vivacious dancing , her charm , the sexiness she exuded as well as the vulnerability , she was a true angel who walked among us . She left the world greater for not only her screen presence , but for bringing to the fore a horrific disease . Quite a legacy . Quite a lady .
494237	342623	63227	10.0	Kind of a Medieval " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf "	Peter O'Toole is Henry II , a true " Lion in Winter " in this 1968 film version of the play by James Goldman and also starring Katharine Hepburn , Anthony Hopkins , Timothy Dalton , Nigel Terry , Jane Merrow and John Castle . On Broadway , the roles of Henry and Eleanor were played by Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris . The casting director for the Broadway production commented that the original auditions , before Preston and Harris injected the spice and humor into the dialogue , were heavy going , the delivery of the actors very , very serious . Imagine this movie with no spark , no sarcasm , no wry humor injected into the lines , and you've got yourself a real nightmare . Fortunately , it's not the case . Though the story takes dramatic license with the truth - for instance , there was no Christmas gathering of the actual family in 1183 , but there was in 1182 - the depiction of the family's infighting , considering how everything turned out , is probably quite correct . King Henry II wants to name his successor and brings his family together . This includes his imprisoned wife , Eleanor of Quitaine ( Hepburn ) , his mistress , Princess Alais ( Merrow ) , and his three sons - Richard ( Hopkins ) , Geoffrey ( Castle ) and John ( Terry ) , and Alais ' brother , King Philip of France ( Dalton ) . Everybody makes deals they don't intend to make good , promises they don't plan to keep , and alliances they don't want in order to secure the throne either , in the sons ' cases , for themselves , or in Eleanor and Henry's cases , for someone else . To say that Henry and Eleanor have a volatile relationship is a tremendous understatement , and the dialogue is an incredible roller-coaster ride that's never boring . One wonders if an audience would sit through such a film today . If not , it's a pity , because it's so brilliant . Watching O'Toole and Hepburn sparring - sometimes so cruelly and bitterly that it's devastating - is addictive . You can't turn away from it . Hepburn shows us immediately by subtle actions - a quick expression that's just as quickly covered up , a slight hesitation in movement or speech - that no matter what her words say , she worships Henry still . For Henry , she is the most challenging and exciting woman he has ever known - and because of the volatility of their relationship , they can't survive together . Talk about being able to push each other's buttons - with Henry , it's whether or not Eleanor slept with his father ; with Eleanor , it's his desire to marry Alais and divorce her . O'Toole takes the title of the film literally , and he indeed roars like an old lion . A powerful and overt actor , Henry II , which he played twice , is one of his greatest roles and this performance perhaps his best . Handsome , sexy , angry and wild , he holds the screen magnificently . For me this is Hepburn's best role . Her Eleanor is beautiful , dignified , sensitive and determined , easily wounded by Henry , though she tries not to show it . Henry II lived another 6 years , during which time Eleanor remained imprisoned by him , although she enjoyed more freedom and actually occasionally traveled with Henry . Henry was succeeded by Richard and then , because Richard had no heirs , by John . Eleanor spent her last years as a nun and , no surprise , outlived all of her children except for King John and Queen Leonora . Both Henry and Eleanor will live forever in " The Lion in Winter . " Imagine a movie with such superstars that Anthony Hopkins has a supporting role - thus was the case in 1968 when the young Hopkins played Richard , a closet homosexual who has had an affair with Philip of France . ( " Oh , Richard , " Eleanor says as she sends him to make a deal with Philip , " promise him ANYTHING . " ) History is quite divided over whether or not Richard was actually gay , but some writings definitely indicate that he was . Hopkins is brilliant as a tough and even cruel man who has a very sensitive side that can be gotten to by his mother . The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent . One of the greatest scripts with one of the greatest casts of all time
494968	342623	32904	10.0	Great ensemble cast makes this one POP	Like a lot of other people , " The Philadelphia Story " is one of my favorite films . It possessed one of the strongest ensemble casts ever assembled : Katharine Hepburn , Cary Grant , James Stewart , Ruth Hussey , Virginia Wiedler , Mary Nash , Roland Young , and Henry Daniell . The film is based on the hit Broadway play , starring Hepburn . One of the many things that distinguishes Hepburn from other major actresses is that she was never an insecure woman about her talent . She surrounded herself with the best people available without fear of being overshadowed . As a result , " The Philadelphia Story " is brilliant . It's an insane , zany story full of blackmail , mistaken identity , changing bridegrooms , and class separation that belongs right where it is , in 1940 . Seen today as a play , it doesn't come off , partly because the acting isn't as adroit and charming as seen here , but also because of societal changes . These are old money idle rich , not new money or celebrities who are fodder for the tabloids and clash with the working class . Tracy's anger at her philandering father is interpreted in the film as coming from a cold , unforgiving daughter rather than someone who's justifiably upset that her mother is going to be hurt again . The comedy is wonderful , handled by masters , with perhaps the most out of the box performance being given by Jimmy Stewart . Gangly , boyish , and funny , he's also quite sexy as he romances Tracy , and his scenes with Grant are priceless . Everyone in " The Philadelphia Story " has a fixed opinion about who they are and who everybody else is , and everyone's values are shaken up as the story unfolds . The film bears repeated watchings and will keep you laughing and on your toes at every viewing . With the rich and mighty - always a little patience .
495120	342623	68398	10.0	love it	This is another of my favorite Columbos . It sports a top-notch cast , including John Cassavetes , who was never handsomer or sexier , Anjanette Comer , Myrna Loy , and Blythe Danner . Now here's something I've always wondered - had Gwenyth Paltrow been born when this episode was shot , or was Danner pregnant at the time ? Thanks to IMDb , I have my answer - she was five months ' pregnant . Now I can really feel ancient . Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother ( Loy ) . He has a mistress on the side , Anjanette Comer , a prominent pianist , but she announces she wants more . She's sick of being back street . On the night of their concert , he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide . Columbo picks up a few problems immediately . One thing he notices : " You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money , a body , and a career . Where's the man ? " It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together . There's a very funny episode at the vet with Columbo's Bassett . Everyone in the cast is great . This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series it became .
493907	342623	116282	10.0	You have no call to get snippy with me .	I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat , her facial expression doesn't change , and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger . Brilliant . This is one of my all time favorite movies . I saw it the first day it opened in New York City , and I loved it . I've seen it again since . What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it . Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it , no fillers . It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations . Wow , when I put it that way , it sounds like anyone could do it . Would that were true . There's no point in going through the story . I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational , as is everyone in the film - she and William H . Macy are standouts . You can really feel his desperation . There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf , the scene with Macy referenced above , her little lecture to the criminals , the stamp discussion . And who can forget her old friend from high school ? That scene is priceless ! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins . This film was a real high point for me . It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses . What can I say , except I'm heading out to the wood chipper .
493897	342623	50212	10.0	Madness	Alec Guiness and his men are ordered to build " The Bridge on the River Kwai " in this magnificent 1957 film starring Alec Guinness , William Holden , Sessue Hayakawa , and Jack Hawkins , and directed by David Lean . Lean manages to give us an epic that manages to focus on fascinating and multilayered characters . The story is based on a book about a real-life incident ; however , in order to make the points made in the film , the story has many fictional elements , including the depiction of Colonel Saito ( Hayakawa ) , who was actually a very humane Japanese officer , and he and the real-life Colonel Nicholson ( Guinness ) , actually named Toosey shared a great respect . In the movie , Saito demands that the British officers in a prisoner of war camp participate in the building a bridge across the river Kwai in Burma during World War II . Colonel Nicholson refuses , and despite harsh imprisonment , will not give in . When his demands are met , he becomes determined to show the superiority of the British army and engineering in the building of the bridge . The bridge becomes an end in itself , although it will actually help the Japanese . William Holden plays an escaped prisoner who is asked to return to the Burmese jungle to help destroy the bridge and the train that is supposed to go over it . Alec Guinness gives his greatest performance as Nicholson - and that's saying something , since he did so many great ones . He has the stoicism , the determination , and the pride necessary for the role , contrasted with the frailty of his imprisonment . One really believes he has endured harsh imprisonment , given the way he looks , talks , and walks . Holden is fabulous as the soldier who , once he gets away , just wants to go home and is forced to go back to the jungle . In one scene , he yells at Major Warden ( Jack Hawkins ) : " You and Colonel Nicholson , you're two of a kind , crazy with courage . For what ? How to die like a gentleman . . . how to die by the rules - when the only important thing is how to live like a human being . " Sessue Hayakawa does a brilliant job as a man as determined as Nicholson and furious that he cannot bend him to his will . The end of the film is extremely suspenseful and builds tension throughout . This is a great film , and an antiwar one - Colonel Nicholson tells Saito that as he ages , he thinks about what his life has meant . Sometimes our goals become confused , and one forgets the real focus . The final line , uttered by Lt . Joyce ( Geoffrey Horne ) says it all .
