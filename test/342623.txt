494029	342623	113627	1.0	beyond bad	A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . Incredibly bad . Very pretentious . It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute . We don't really learn anything about this character , except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic . We don't know why . Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual , but I feel that this role and this script let him down . And how , after not being able to perform for the whole film , can he have an erection on his deathbed ? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath .
494631	342623	427575	4.0	on the dull side	This entry into Hallmark's rotating mystery series is fairly dull . One wonders where that extremely high rating - and no comments - comes from . Mystery Woman lacks the colorfulness of the McBride series . Kellie Martin is darling , but this show dragged . It's always great to see old-timer Clarence Williams III . However , he is so laid back in this , he makes the late Perry Como seem manic . The lack of energy is probably due to the poor direction . One more establishing shot of the " Mystery Woman Bookstore " and I was ready to do an Elvis and shoot the television . The whole thing was done in a very pedantic style .
494796	342623	35980	4.0	astrology vs . astronomy	Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this trite comedy , but it seemed to me to be all over the place . Hedy Lamarr plays a silly woman , who , neglected by her astronomer husband , William Powell , believes an astrologer who tells her that she will meet another man at a certain time . She does , and it turns out to be the neighborhood air raid warden , James Craig . She then announces she's leaving her husband , to his consternation . The heavenly body refers to Lamarr , of course , who is absolutely gorgeous in this movie as usual , if not much of an actress , also as usual . She did have one of the most exquisite faces of all time , though . The heavenly body also refers to Whitley's comet , a comet to be named after her husband . Powell handles the comedy well . It's a good cast , mildly enjoyable , but in the end , there's not much to it .
494010	342623	319507	4.0	Inaccurate , boring , done on the cheap documentary	" Hollywood Sex Symbols " is a thrown together mess featuring some - certainly not all - of Hollywood sex symbols from the 1920s through the 1970s - in about 42 minutes . The footage is of poor quality and of little interest . In the beginning , as the commentator talks about Hollywood glamor and the beautiful people , there is a clip of three men standing outside of the Oscars - all unrecognizable , and one of them looks like Dwight D . Eisenhower . The commentator then announces the name of the program as " Hollywood'S Sex Symbols " while the chiron says " Hollywood Sex Symbols . " Right away you know you're in trouble . Most stars get between 30 seconds and 1 minute , with the majority of time spent on Sophia Loren and Marilyn Monroe , although there is one long , dull segment of Bridget Bardot posing for photographers . There are no clips from movies . Everything shown is from press conferences or premiers , or events where the press was present , and the film quality is uniformly bad . The rest of the material is photographs . Jayne Mansfield is included ; Jean Harlow is not . Rita Hayworth is included ; Ava Gardner is not . Clark Gable is included ( along with some interesting news - he won an Oscar for Gone With the Wind ) ; Gary Cooper is not . The commentator talks about Rita Cansino and how different she looked before becoming Rita Hayworth , but we only get to see photos of Rita Hayworth in her prime . The cast list on the IMDb page lists Charlie Chaplin - must have missed him , but doesn't list Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn , both of whom were included . Since the program was done in 1988 , Rock Hudson is omitted . Very poor and easily skipped .
494650	342623	52325	5.0	Unusual casting in a strange comedy	1958 was before Ross Hunter embarked Doris Day on the fabulous career she had in the ' 60s , in which she would become a top box office draw - in fact , THE box office drawer for years . In " The Tunnel of Love , " she plays a sweet , vivacious woman who is desperate to have a baby and can't , so she and her husband , played by Richard Widmark , plan to adopt one . When the adopted baby bears a strong resemblance to Widmark , he becomes sure that the child is the result of an evening he can't remember with the investigative social worker ( Gia Scala ) . Based on a play , this kind of light , subtly sexual comedy became very popular on the dinner theater circuit in the ' 60s and ' 70s , joining the ranks of " Mary , Mary " , " The Marriage Go Round , " " Boeing Boeing , " etc . It is not particularly well directed by Gene Kelly and sports the very strange casting of Richard Widmark as Day's confused husband . I can't agree with the comments here . Though an actor known for playing tough roles and cruel men , he does a credible job here mainly because he knows enough not to play for laughs . He creates a full character , that of a caring if foolish man who adores his wife but screws up occasionally . Gig Young plays the philandering husband next door . He's fine , but the character is very unlikable . There's not really much to recommend here . I suppose at the time it was considered somewhat suggestive , but it doesn't play well today .
493502	342623	409182	5.0	Tragic use of big bucks to make a big ripoff	98 minutes of fake-looking special effects and sheer dreck comprise " Poseidon , " a 2006 movie hoping for people trying to get in out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theater . It was commented by an observant viewer on the board for " San Francisco " that Hollywood has lost the art of the buildup , the point being that the big earthquake in " San Francisco " didn't occur until the last portion of the film . The film spent its time building up the characters and situations , all heading toward that fateful day . Ditto " In Old Chicago . " Nowadays , when writers attempt to build a story , it's usually written in too slow a fashion . A great example of a film where this WASN'T the case was " Match Point , " written by the brilliant Woody Allen - but you'll have to really look to find another film like that . Producers won't even consider a script that doesn't get to the point in the first 10 minutes . In " Poseidon , " Hollywood has reached a new low - and who knew it could sink any lower ? We have stock characters given one or two lines to explain their characters . I'm not sure why any of them bothered . There was absolutely no way to care about them . Why not just start with the ship sinking ? This was a movie about special effects , nothing more . Why pretend otherwise . Some of the special effects were quite exciting on the big screen , so I gave it a 5 . I can't comment on the performances . There weren't any . P . S . I was told - and I don't know if this is true - that if a ship the size of the Poseidon sinks , and you're anywhere near it on a lifeboat , the undertow drags you down with it . Not that anyone was going for accuracy here .
493530	342623	65537	5.0	thanks for nothing , Colonel Parker	Poor Elvis . He was advised to do Midnight Cowboy , Barbra wanted him for A Star is Born - but thanks to the Colonel , his last screen appearance was Change of Habit , so he could complete his contract with the studio . Elvis , it seems , lost a bet with the devil . Actually , the film is quite pleasant with a familiar and competent cast . Mary Tyler Moore comes off the worst - - we know she's an excellent actress but this role is impossible - eyes heavenward , she resists Elvis ' advances as she has her Crisis of Faith . Great to see a young Jane Elliot before her soap opera days . Elvis does fine , he always does . He looks good and sounds great . And as much as this film has been made fun of , it has more dignity than Harem Scarum or some of the others . What a shame - Elvis had more acting talent than was ever mined , and , had he been challenged , would have lived up to it .
493704	342623	408854	5.0	a very quick look at the history of Hollywood	This documentary covers the history of Hollywood in something like 51 minutes , focusing mainly on the achievements of MGM , beginning with the forming of the company . Lots of classic scenes which have been seen countless times are intertwined with an auction of the " Showboat " boat , Judy's red shoes , and the Bounty ship , all at lowball prices since it's 1972 . The problem with watching " Hollywood : The Dream Factory " today is that everything covered is very familiar now , and movie buffs have seen the footage dozens of times . However , if you want a quick and dirty look at the problems with the way over budget Ben Hur , the discovery of Greta Garbo , how no one but Gable could do Gone With the Wind , and a look at that big MGM luncheon , this is for you .
494283	342623	496275	5.0	Behind the scenes of a tabloid	It's too early to really judge " Dirt " yet . Based on the pilot , it's sleazy as hell and has no likable characters . Of course , F / X is an expert at this kind of thing and just might make it a go . The star is Courtney Cox as Lucy , the editor of " Dirt " and " Now " magazines . She's a cold bitch who wants whatever slime she can get on celebrities - all of whom are painted as young , on drugs , having sex in restaurants , and cheating on their spouses and significant others . Frankly , when Don the schizophrenic ( the only character I actually liked and felt sorry for ) gets their revealing photos , it's kind of hard to have pity on any of them . At the end of the show , the writers tried to flesh out the Lucy character a bit , showing her as a lonely woman who seems to care about Don the schizophrenic . Not sure I bought it , since I'd just seen her use a stun gun on someone she slept with , as she suspects he only went to bed with her because he knows who she is and wanted his CD promoted . Cox looks gorgeous . The acting ranges from okay to lousy . There are lots of new young faces , and one suspects that the budget went for other things . " Dirt " gives the audience a very dim view of Hollywood , celebrities , and the tabloids that basically is what the mainstream media has been telling us for years . Everyone is Paris , Britney , Nicole , Justin ; no one practices safe sex ; and everyone uses drugs . It's all kind of sick . Is there an audience for it ? Most likely .
494398	342623	25346	5.0	familiar story with the Irish struggle as background	William Powell is Bill , a British officer who finds an old love in Ireland in " The Key , " a 1934 film also starring Edna Best ( Norah ) and Colin Clive ( Andy ) . A very young Donald Crisp , though his voice identifies him immediately , plays a Sein Fein leader whom the British army seeks to capture . When Bill arrives on the scene , he finds himself living below Andy , a fellow officer and friend , but he doesn't know that the woman he once loved is married to him - and Andy never knew that Bill and Norah were involved . Realizing that their breakup was a mistake , Bill seeks to rekindle the relationship . Norah has continued to love him , and it's stood between her and her husband throughout their marriage . Full of dry ice and night scenes , this old movie was hard to see at times . The story is very familiar , the film is short ; it doesn't have a lot to recommend it . It's atmospheric , although this viewer was not drawn into the story . Powell brings it lots of energy - he's the best thing in it ; Best and Clive don't project much and look unhappy throughout .
494989	342623	33117	5.0	odd Crawford vehicle	Watching this film , the lead role of Susan seemed to call out " Norma Shearer " to me , and sure enough , reading up on it , the rights to the play were purchased by MGM with Shearer in mind . Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford were both fabulous movie stars but with different gifts . You could not call either one of them great , visceral actresses so it was always best to lead with their strengths . Crawford's was drama . Shearer's was comedy . This is just my opinion . " Susan and God " is the story of a ditsy woman , unhappily married to drunken Frederic March , who takes a trip and comes back with religious fervor gained from a new group that emphasizes God , his guidance , and telling the truth . She then proceeds to wreak havoc on her entire social set and manages to break up one marriage and one near-marriage . March agrees to stay sober if she'll give their relationship a chance , and with their somewhat neglected daughter , Blossom , they spend the summer together . Ruth Hussey is a friend who is in love with March . Crawford is an absolute disaster in this role , speaking very fast in a high-pitched voice that is supposed to represent her dizziness . She mugs , she poses , she wears absurd outfits ( with the exception of the gorgeous one she wears to go to the train ) . It's a completely mannered , external performance . Shearer would have been much more natural in the role . Crawford is annoying . When it comes down to doing the more dramatic scenes in the film , she does much better . The rest of the cast is very good , including March , Hussey , Rita Quigley , and a young , lovely Rita Hayworth . Due to Crawford , this comes off as rather strange , and it took me a while to realize it was supposed to be a comedy .
494310	342623	43643	6.0	Disappointing	Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell teamed up for producer Howard Hughes for the first time in " His Kind of Woman , " which also stars Raymond Burr , Vincent Price , and Marjorie Reynolds . In order to get back into the country , deported mobster Nick Ferraro ( Burr ) hires gambler Dan Milner ( Mitchum ) to come to Mexico . Ferraro intends to have a plastic surgeon make his face close to Dan's , get rid of Dan , and then come back to the U . S . as Dan . Milner , of course , doesn't know who's hired him and what for . When he reaches the resort where he is to wait for his transportation , he starts getting suspicious that this is not the type of job he wants . Lenore ( Russell ) is on hand as the girlfriend of actor Mark Cardigan ( Vincent Price ) whose wife unexpectedly arrives . Thinking Cardigan was divorced , Lenore is none too happy - plus , no surprise , she's falling for Dan . Mitchum and Russell are a wonderful team . He smolders and she sizzles . They both look fantastic , with Russell wearing a fabulous wardrobe that shows off her assets . She also sings a couple of unmemorable songs , but she sings them well . Raymond Burr was appropriately sinister in the days before he was good guy Perry Mason . His elegant clothing belie his mean expression and sinister , callous actions . The problem for me was that the plot just did not hold my interest . The film seemed overly long and somewhat plodding . That being said , the highlight of the movie is Vincent Price , a swashbuckling actor on the way down who decides to turn reel life into real life . He is truly fabulous , and his role gives the movie a specialness it would not otherwise have . Mitchum and Russell made better films , together and separately . Worth seeing for the actors , especially Price . " His Kind of Woman " has a good plot that is not particularly well executed .
493760	342623	167752	6.0	Odd . I find it odd .	I was confused from the beginning of " The 4th Floor " because , fool that I am , it never once occurred to me that this young woman talking with William Hurt ( who is my age ) was actually his girlfriend . She looked like his daughter and in fact , with the 23 year difference in their ages , could have been . Once that was out of the way , I started to concentrate . This is a pretty scary movie if you like the genre , but it doesn't make any sense . I can understand Jane moving into her late aunt's apartment - it's New York City , after all , reasonably priced apartments are hard to come by , and she doesn't want to move in with her boyfriend . But no matter how reasonable the rent , no one would have stayed in that building . The neighbors are all totally bizarre and someone - she thinks it's her neighbor on the 4th floor - - is tormenting her . Aggressively . There are sometimes one can put these problems in a film aside and sometimes that one can't . This would be one of the times that one can't . It really stretched all reason . If it was the type of film where one just had to suspend belief , that would have been another story , but it wasn't . I figured the plot out long before the denouement , although the ending is ambiguous in a way . The acting was mixed . Lewis sounded like she was imitating Jennifer Elise Cox's character on Lovespring , and Hurt's role was beneath him . The supporting players were the marvelous Austin Pendleton and Shelley Duvall who gave wonderful and interesting performances . All in all , scary stuff , good atmosphere , an okay rental .
494807	342623	22208	6.0	young stars cut their teeth on this early drama	Barbara Stanwyck is a " Night Nurse " in this 1931 film also starring Joan Blondell , Ben Lyon and Clark Gable . Stanwyck and Blondell stumble on a murder for trust fund plot , and Stanwyck gets help from a bootlegger she helped when he was shot . I like what one of the IMDb reviewers said , that this was an " evil of the big city " film for those audiences who didn't live in one . Stanwyck faces down a crooked doctor and an evil chauffeur ( Gable ) to thwart this plot , though she's warned it's best not to make waves . Stanwyck is very good , showing her tough side with the criminals and her sweet side with the children . Gable , with no mustache , looks very handsome in his chauffeur outfit and acts menacing . He definitely always had a strong presence . Blondell is the wisecracking , streetwise nurse - her part is smaller than Stanwyck's . The young women do a lot of parading around in their underwear and there's lots of sexual talk between the lines - this is pre-Code . Worth seeing for work of these early stars , and pre-code films are usually interesting .
493974	342623	57191	6.0	Okay Elvis fare	As someone else mentioned , 1963 is still early enough that Elvis Presley looks like he's enjoying himself in " It Happened at the World's Fair , " which also stars Gary Lockwood , Joan O'Brien and Vicky Tiu . Pilots Mike ( Elvis ) and Danny ( Lockwood ) find themselves without a plane after it's confiscated for debts due to Lockwood's addiction to gambling . They hitch a ride to Seattle with a man and his 7-year-old niece Sue-Lin ( Tiu ) , and Mike ends up taking the little girl to the 1962 World's Fair . When she eats too much junk , he takes her to the clinic , where he meets Diane Warren ( Joan O'Brien ) , a nurse . He comes on a little strong - so strong , I'm surprised she didn't call security . In order to see her again , he gives a little boy ( Kurt Russell ) a quarter to kick him in the shins . After he return Sue-Lin to her uncle , she finds Mike again when her uncle doesn't come home from making a delivery . Mike now has to cope with a not very helpful partner , trying to think of a way to get his plane back , romancing Diane and taking care of a 7-year-old girl . This is the usual Elvis travelogue , but more interesting than others because it's shot on the grounds of the Seattle World's Fair and has that iconic moment when future brilliant Elvis impersonator Russell lets him have it in the shins . Elvis looks great and as usual sings beautifully . The music is pretty good . This wasn't the film career Elvis wanted but unfortunately for his ambitions , these films made money . Enjoyable .
494192	342623	35552	6.0	The Fox in Georgia	Red Skelton and Ann Rutherford are " Whistling in Dixie " in this 1942 programmer also starring Guy Kibbee and Rags Ragland ( in a dual role ) . Skelton played the role of Wally Benton a couple of times . On radio , Benton is " The Fox , " a detective , but in his private life he gets dragged into real mysteries as well . This one is at the behest of a friend of his fiancé's ( Rutherford ) who asks them to come to Georgia to investigate a murder . There are some funny moments in this film , but it's rather silly , with a lot of corny jokes , funny faces from Skelton and slapstick . Actually Skelton is much better when he's straightforward - he comes off as sweet , sincere and natural . Some of the supporting cast has the worst southern accents I've ever heard . It's hard to blame them , though , because these types of films were made very quickly . I'm sure they had no dialect coach . However , the horrible accents were very distracting . Okay , but " The Fox " isn't one of my favorite detectives .
493477	342623	102220	6.0	I liked the original better	With a few changes , and for reasons known only to themselves , the powers that be remade 1956's " A Kiss Before Dying " in 1991 . Now the sisters are twins , and the plot is taken out further - rather than just getting engaged , Ellen now marries the killer . That's not a spoiler - we see him murder her sister in the first reel . The original of this film , with Robert Wagner , Joanne Woodward , Jeffrey Hunter , Virginia Leith and Mary Astor was much more entertaining . This update is boring and acted in a lazy manner by its stars , Sean Young I , Sean Young II , and Matt Dillon . Isn't one Sean Young bad enough , we had to have two of them ? Supporting players Diane Ladd and Max von Sydow have precious little to do . The only part I liked was the scene from " Vertigo " on TV - but I do hope the director wasn't trying to compare himself to Hitchcock . I don't understand Hollywood's obsession with remakes , except that I suppose they're cheaper because the studio already owns the property . But a fresh story line here and there wouldn't hurt . On top of which , it is a rare occasion when the remake is actually better . This is not one of those cases .
494569	342623	106386	6.0	Another great Amy Irving performance	How many times have I watched something for a period of time before realizing that I'm looking at Amy Irving ? This film was no exception . The woman is a chameleon , and though she certainly has been recognized for her work , I think she's underrated . The plot of this film is mildly interesting - a man convicted of murdering his wife makes parole and looks up his daughter , who helped put him away . His daughter begins to doubt her testimony . It would have been more intriguing to keep the plot on that level , to have the audience unsure throughout the film . Unfortunately , the plot disintegrates past a certain point and becomes a chase film , albeit through some magnificent scenery . Donald Sutherland is very good in what has become a familiar role for him . But Amy makes the movie .
493462	342623	20695	6.0	early talkie shows its age	Basil Rathbone is a dashing , intense-looking Philo Vance in " The Bishop Murder Case , " an early talkie that shows signs of the painful transition from silents . I actually had quite a bit of trouble with the sound . I saw it on television and had difficulty understanding what was being said at times . The film , nevertheless , is very interesting , if only to see Rathbone , with those amazing eyes of his , in his pre-Sherlock Holmes days . His acting is excellent . It was also delightful to see Roland Young . Leila Hyams plays the professor's niece , and she was quite beautiful and effective . It has a good plot as well . Parts of this film came off like a stage play , probably because some of the actors were still adjusting to film technique . And the sound was darned strange . In one of the outdoor scenes , the actors sounded as if they were speaking through megaphones . Nevertheless , Philo Vance fans should certainly enjoy it , as will others from a historical perspective .
494092	342623	52168	6.0	Low-budget thriller	1958's " Screaming Mimi " is based on a novel by Frederic Brown and stars Anita Ekberg , Philip Carey , Harry Townes and Gypsy Rose Lee . Ekberg is Virginia , aka Yolanda , a drop-dead gorgeous exotic dancer who is institutionalized after nearly being murdered at her stepbrother's house . The kindly psychiatrist ( Townes ) trying to help her takes the transference a bit too far - he fakes her death and takes off with her . Virginia changes her name to Yolanda and gets a job as an exotic dancer in a club run by Joann Masters ( Lee ) . A reporter named Sweeney ( Philip Carey ) gets onto a story about a slasher and crosses paths with Virginia / Yolanda and , like every other man , falls for her . In Yolanda's dressing room , Sweeney finds a statue - the same statue was found next to the last murder victim , also an exotic dancer . This is an interesting story for sure with sexual undertones ( or shall I say overtones ) galore - Ekberg's chained slave dance , the lesbian relationship Joann has with another dancer , the statue fetish , and Ekberg herself , sex on heels . Her first film was " Mississippi Gambler , " in which she was uncredited ; not surprisingly , she got the attention of the film's star , Tyrone Power , and had an affair with him that lasted into the mid-'50s . She even got to meet his relatives in Cincinnati - and he was still married at the time . Was she good in this ? I have no idea ; she's so stunning , it doesn't matter . Philip Carey , known today for his portrayal of Asa Buchanan in " One Life to Live " was a hunk in the ' 50s who was relegated to B films costarring many beautiful women - he's easy on the eyes too and does a decent job as Sweeney . Harry Townes had a huge career in television and underplays the role of Greene , the psychiatrist . He does a good job - if the character appeared sinister , it wouldn't have been believable . A story like this could easily have been given a big budget and big director and been much more effective . As it is , it keeps one's attention with its twists and turns and one of the great va-va-vooms , Ekberg .
494159	342623	28872	6.0	Nice to think about young love	I admit not knowing much about the part of British history conveyed in " Fire over England . " The main interest for me was seeing the two young lovers , Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier , who began their affair during this film . What a beautiful couple , what a great love , and what a sad end to it . You'd never dream looking at these two what life had in store for them on the personal front . " Fire over England " is a 1937 Alexander Korda film that takes place in 1558 . Relations between Spain and England are terrible , with the British capturing Spanish gold from the New World . When a scheme to get her off the throne is uncovered , the Queen ( Flora Robson ) sends a young man , Michael Ingolby ( Olivier ) undercover to the court of Philip of Spain . Pretending to be a traitor , he is able to get the names of the actual Brits in the pay of the Spanish and learns they want to send the Armada against England . He goes to battle , leading an attack by night on the Armada ships . Meanwhile , he is in love with one of the Queen's ladies in waiting , Cynthia ( Leigh ) and has the affection of the Queen herself . " Fire over England " is an early acting film acting assignment from Laurence Olivier . He is super-handsome and an exuberant , energetic Michael Ingolby , perhaps a bit overdone in spots . This , however , can be forgiven because of the nature of the role . Leigh really doesn't have much to do . Though Selznick allegedly was introduced Vivien Leigh by his brother Myron when Atlanta was burning , a historian made something of the fact that he evidently saw this film beforehand . If he did , there's no way he would have a ) remembered Leigh and b ) thought of her for Scarlett . All in all , a very interesting film .
495146	342623	82353	6.0	slow but effective	This movie is great fun to see William Hurt , James Woods and Sigourney Weaver at the beginnings of their careers and when they were experiencing a good deal of success . The rest of the cast is top-notch . The story is very interesting and effective , though I found the film a bit uneven and slow .
495147	342623	116845	6.0	intriguing and seductive	The center of this film is the interesting performance of Jon Bon Jovi as a somewhat mysterious actor who is portraying a hit man in a play written by Lambert Wilson . Bon Jovi is very effective and keeps you guessing throughout . Wilson is excellent as a confused playwright half in love with an ingenue but who finds , when the chips are down , that he's not quite ready to give up his wife . With such an attractive cast and wondering about the motives of Jon Bon Jovi , the movie is quite intriguing , though draggy in parts .
493732	342623	21225	6.0	Dated early talkie	The chirons at the beginning of 1930's " Outward Bound " tell us in aching detail how Sutton Vane's play took the London stage by storm . It subsequently was done on Broadway not once but twice ( the second time was some years after this film ) , and the film uses three of the play's original cast : Leslie Howard , Beryl Mercer and Dudley Digges . The film was remade in 1944 as " Between Two Worlds " and the plot was changed slightly to reflect World War II . " Outward Bound " is the story of several people on board ship , but none of them knows the reason for being there or where they're going . Finally they figure out that they are all dead and face the judgment of The Examiner ( Digges ) who arrives to tell them their fate . Heaven and hell are really the same place , it turns out , and those going to the less desirable place merely have some things to work on before heading upward . Two people , however , will not be leaving the ship - that's the suicide couple ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr . and Helen Chandler ) who , like the purser , are " halfways " and must stay on the ship for eternity . The film is very bizarre looking , in a good way , very foggy , with an amorphous skyline when the outside of the ship ( a toy boat ) is shown . The atmosphere is appropriately dark and eerie . The problem with " Outward Bound " is two-fold . The acting is melodramatic and very stagy ; also , the actors don't have the talkie " rhythm " down yet , so they sound very stilted . Leslie Howard , who in the film takes the part played on stage by Alfred Lunt , gives no indication that he will become a great film star - his performance is for the stage and terribly hammy . Interestingly , both he and Fairbanks Jr . not long after this movie would give wonderful performances , Howard in " The Petrified Forest " and Fairbanks in " Love is a Racket . " Fairbanks in particular had a remarkably modern acting technique , but not in " Outward Bound . " Strangely enough , as with " Between Two Worlds , " there is something compelling and sympathetic about most of these characters . Perhaps it's a fascination we have with the afterlife , but the story does hold together , and we do care what happens to the " good guys " on the ship . I admit to liking " Between Two Worlds " better , especially the suicide couple plot , which is better handled in the latter film . " Outward Bound " today is an interesting artifact but worth seeing , especially if you can follow it up with " Between Two Worlds . "
493645	342623	101536	6.0	Cute movie , but I was looking at the nerd	Obviously this film was intended for a young audience , which is why none of the posted comments mention the presence of Tyrone Power Jr . , who is the only reason I watched this movie . " California Casanova " doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is - light entertainment featuring attractive people with lots of hair , makeup , and great bodies . Ruth Landers produced this film for her daughter Audrey , who gives a sweet performance as a young woman being pressured by her thug boyfriend to stay with him . The plots are a little bit disjointed . There's the Landers plot , which ties in with the Jerry Orbach plot . Orbach brings his usual wonderful professionalism to an offbeat role for him , that of a fake count trying to give some class to a nerd - Tyrone Power Jr . Tyrone Power Jr . resembles his late father so much , particularly in the first shots of him , that I got goosebumps . Were he a stronger actor , his career might have at least approached that of his father's , but he's never really been able to rise above decent parts in independent films and bit roles in larger ones . He does a lot of indicating , i . e . , shaking his head , grimacing , etc . , as he did in " Cocoon . " However , circa 1991 , he was gorgeous , and his love scene with Landers was sheer perfection . His entrance as a polished , classy gentleman was very similar to his father's entrance in " The Razor's Edge , " though I suspect that was more of a coincidence than an actual choice on the part of the director . He also , at least when the film was made , did not have a good agent - his role in this film was as much of a lead as Landers ' , yet he is billed below the title . Landers gets to show off her singing voice in the film , and she's quite good . All in all , " California Casanova " is mindlessly diversionary and of definite interest for old film buffs who will be glad to see that the son also rises .
493854	342623	56209	6.0	ruthless business types hit the screen again	Dana Andrews is an ambitious public relations man in " Madison Avenue , " a 1962 film that also stars Eleanor Parker , Jeanne Crain , Eddie Albert , Kathleen Freeman , Howard St . John and Henry Daniell . By 1962 , this was no longer an A cast , and this is a second tier film at best . Andrews romances reporter Peggy Shannon ( Crain ) and public relations firm owner Anne Tremaine ( Parker ) as he makes his way up the corporate ladder with the goal of landing a huge milk account away from his old boss . He becomes the puppet holding the strings of the head of the company ( Albert ) and , in a desperate attempt to keep the account , pimps out Anne to him in a not too subtle scene . Though a ' 62 film , it's made in black and white and feels like a ' 50s movie - possibly because corporate ambition was a ' 50s topic with films like " Executive Suite " and " Woman's World . " The acting is good but the story is slow in spots , and I felt at the end like the writer just decided to stop writing . The whole thing was kind of a shrug without enough bite or top level stars to make it really powerful . Is it worth seeing ? Yes , Andrews is solid , it's always worth it to see Parker and the always beautiful Crain , and a delight to see character actor Henry Daniell so late in his career . It's mildly entertaining , which is more than I can say about a lot of films made today .
494358	342623	59557	6.0	Yet another ' 60s spy caper , this one pre-global warming	James Coburn is " Our Man Flint " in this 1966 spy film . Flint is called in by our government to find and destroy the enemy's capability to control the weather . Given our current situation with global warming , it was actually quite interesting . The cool , perfect Flint is a derivative of James Bond , a gadget-ridden spy , unflappable in the face of certain death , totally brilliant , and a sex machine surrounded by gorgeous , buxom women . Played by the resonant-voiced , angular-faced James Coburn , Flint sails through his assignment , not only escaping death but faking death when it suits him . It's a fun movie , but it's amazing how many of this type of film and spy films in general were made in the ' 60s - not only the Bond films , but caper films like Topkapi , Gambit , the Harry Palmer films , Casino Royale ( where James bond was a character ) - these films and takeoffs of them , like The Glass-Bottomed Boat - abounded . It's always nice to reminisce about the ' 60s , and " Our Man Flint " has the music , the dancing , the gowns , the gadgets and the bustlines that will take you right back . A good time .
494150	342623	23891	6.0	Early Hepburn	Katharine Hepburn is a beautiful and accomplished aviatrix in " Christopher Strong , " a 1933 film also starring Clive Owen and Billie Burke , and directed by Dorothy Arzner . Hepburn's role of Lady Cynthia is loosely based on Amelia Earhart , a young , ambitious career woman who is not interested in marriage and home but rather accomplishment . She's an early feminist , and the role is perfect for Hepburn , who with her androgynous looks and strong performances would go on to play many such roles in her very long career . " Christopher Strong " is of interest because it's early Hepburn , has a feminist theme in the early ' 30s , and also because it's pre-Code . Arzner does a great job depicting the love affair of Hepburn and Owen and yet shows nothing , with a hand reaching up and checking the time on a small clock . . . then the light is turned off and plunges the room into darkness after the lovers exchange a few words . The problem with the movie is that it's badly dated , a ' 30s melodrama with tremulous , " we must be honorable , " pip-pip and all that rot dialogue . Owen tells everyone at a party that he will never be unfaithful to his wife , that it is a moral charge he holds high - and seconds later he meets Hepburn and you can tell he's already falling . Owen is an odd choice of a romantic partner - he's not exactly the man one would give up everything for . A bigger problem is the performance of Billie Burke , a fine actress . She is extremely sympathetic as the suffering wife - so sympathetic , in fact , and Hepburn seems so callous about the whole thing for most of the film , that one sides with what I'm sure is the wrong person . Also , putting up with your husband's infidelity and not saying anything brings us right back into aggressive non-feminism . I am forced to agree with one of the other comments - yes , it is directed by an important director , yes , it stars an important , legendary star , yes , it's early feminism , and yes , it's not that great a movie , rather , an artifact . Worth seeing ? To catch Hepburn in that moth costume - absolutely .
493601	342623	54710	6.0	By soap possessed	Lana Turner , Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . , Jason Robards , Barbara Bel Geddes , Susan Kohner and George Hamilton are - if we are to believe the title - " By Love Possessed " in this 1961 film which also stars Thomas Mitchell and Yvonne Craig . As the name of the movie indicates , this is a huge , glossy , color soap opera featuring beautiful fall scenery , huge homes and the attractive people in them , fancy cars and lots of driving scenes . The only house which isn't sumptuous belongs to the supposedly super-wealthy Helen - in her scenes , she looks like she lives in a Motel 6 . BLP is supposed to be about SEX . Hamilton gets it ; Lana can't get it so she rides horses ; Efrem can't get it so he works late at the office ; Kohner can't get it so she looks at papers in her safety deposit box ; Mitchell can't get it because he's too old ; Robards can't have it because he's a cripple ; Bel Geddes can't get it because she's in a marriage where the couple has drifted apart ; and Craig has enough for all of them . The couples - - Marjorie and Julius ( Lana and Jason ) , Clarissa and Arthur ( Bel Geddes and Zimbalist ) , Helen and Warren ( Kohner and Hamilton ) do a lot of talking and Warren and Veronica ( Craig ) do a lot of making out . It all adds up to a big zero that obviously was meant to cash in on Turner's big success with " Imitation of Life , " as was " Portrait in Black " but in both films , they forgot to have Douglas Sirk direct . The acting is fairly superficial except for Jason Robards and Barbara Bel Geddes . Bel Geddes , a wonderful actress , creates a real character with real emotions , sticks with it , and is a success . Robards , famous for his performances in Eugene O'Neill works , is out of place here ; he has no one to play off of , as he has to act with Zimbalist and Turner . The very pretty Yvonne Craig , who would have better success in television , pouts well . Susan Kohner has none of the allure she displayed in " Imitation of Life " but with the help of an ugly wig , creates a sad character nonetheless . Hamilton is in the Tony Perkins role , which Perkins would have done a lot better . Hamilton is someone I prefer as a personality who parodies himself . When he attempts to act , it's painful . Zimbalist , who always comes off as a rich society person , comes off as a rich society person here . Very handsome , with a fine speaking voice , he never has had much range . Not that he needed a lot here , but he needed more than he had . Lana Turner looks lovely , though her fashions don't register as they have in past films . She could always pull off an adulterous drunk - I personally don't think she has enough to do . There are too many other characters . If you're going to do a Lana Turner movie , I say make it a Lana Turner movie and let's see us some more Lana ! The end of the film is pure Hollywood hokum . So are the beginning and the middle . This type of film is usually fun if nothing else ; this one is tedious .
493758	342623	28587	6.0	okay musical	Jack Benny , Ida Lupino , Gail Patrick , Judy Canova and Ben Blue star in " Artists & Models , " a 1937 film directed by Rapul Walsh . Benny plays Mac Brewster , the owner of an advertising agency who lands the Townsend Silver Account . Mac has a ball planned , the Artists and Models Ball , and the " Townsend girl , " who is to be their model , will be queen of the ball . Mac wants his girlfriend Paula ( Lupino ) to be the model , but Townsend ( Richard Arlen ) wants a society girl . Paula takes off for Miami , where Townsend is going , and poses as a society girl . Townsend offers her the job . Mac , meanwhile , has met a bona fide society girl , the beautiful Gail Patrick , who has approached him about helping with a charity . He shows up in Miami with her . This movie is loaded with musical numbers that , in this writer's opinion , aren't great , with the exception of the last one , a number set in Harlem . That one , featuring Louis Armstrong , would have been better if they'd hired a black woman to sing the lead instead of putting Martha Raye in dark makeup . Ben Blue and Judy Canova are a little bit over the top , and those numbers seem very dated today . Ida Lupino looks beautiful and always turned in a good performance . When one sees her here as an ingénue , it's easy to appreciate her many accomplishments playing tough-gal roles and her work as a director . Benny is funny , but frankly , he doesn't have great material to work with . Gail Patrick , with her beautiful looks and voice , is her usual classy self . Cecil Cunningham , as Mac's secretary , is a standout with her dry wit . All in all , not fabulous . I usually don't think of Raoul Walsh and musicals in the same thought process for a reason .
494977	342623	45128	6.0	B movie starring Cesar Romero	" Lady in the Fog " is a 1952 film starring Cesar Romero as an amateur detective , Philip O'Dell , an American currently in London . He helps a woman ( Lois Maxwell ) whom he meets in a bar - her brother was run down by a car in the heavy London fog , but she is convinced that it wasn't accidental . O'Dell investigates , and finds himself involved with an old case , a mental hospital , a filmmaker , and a nightclub . Romero is a delightful actor , and this story has a lot of comedic elements which he acquits very well . He was very underrated , which is clear if one sees him in " The Captain from Castile " and " Julia Misbehaves . " The story of " Lady in the Fog " is about as lame as it gets and pretty easy to figure out . It's made on the cheap . Romero is always worth seeing , though .
494744	342623	45094	6.0	The boys search for sunken treasure	1952's ROAD TO BALI is my first " road " picture , and I don't think it's the one I should have started with - after all , by 1952 , this shtick had to be getting pretty old . I admit to being a fan of Bob Hope , especially in his ' 40s films ; I'm not a particular fan of Bing Crosby as an actor . I'm more a fan of his incredible singing in the early ' 30s . But having heard a lot about these " road " movies , I wanted to see one . ROAD TO BALI isn't as highly rated as some of the others . The premise has to do with Bob and Bing , two vaudevillians who escape from Australia to avoid the father of the woman they're both engaged to for some reason . They eventually meet Dorothy Lamour , Bob dives for treasure and is almost killed by a giant squid , and then the three of them plus the treasure head for Bali . Along the way , there's music , corny jokes and beautiful women . The scene where a widowed ape decides Bob is her next mate is very funny ( " Why am I always attracted to young widows ? " he asks ) , and there are a few more laughs along the way . Just not enough . Dorothy Lamour is lovely and has a great figure . Many years ago , a friend of mine was in a revue where Lamour was scheduled to appear . Everyone looked for her , ignoring the old lady in the corner , who turned out to be Lamour . When costumes and makeup got through with her , she looked exactly as she did in the Road pictures . Good for her . I look forward earlier installments of this series .
494425	342623	44013	7.0	Shades of Rebecca	Robert Young is one seemingly unlucky guy in " The Second Woman , " a 1950 film also starring Betsy Drake , Morris Carnovsky , John Sutton , Florence Bates and Henry O'Neill . This was probably a ' B ' noir ; like " Shining Victory " and " The Uninvited , " it is reminiscent of " Rebecca " - in fact , the beginning narration is basically a paraphrase of " Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay . " This film even goes so far as to have Florence Bates playing Drake's aunt ; she was Mrs . DeWinter's employer in " Rebecca . " Drake is Ellen Foster , a young woman en route by train to visit her aunt when she meets her aunt's attractive neighbor , Jeff Cohalon ( Young ) . He's built a fantastic house that , her aunt informs Ellen , no one has ever been in . He built it for his bride-to-be , and she was killed in a car accident before the wedding . Since then , several people - his almost father-in-law , Ben ( O'Neill ) , to whom Jeff is like a son , and a psychiatrist , Dr . Hartley ( Carnovsky ) have been concerned about Jeff . He seems absent-minded and moody . Then strange things begin to happen to Jeff - he has to shoot his horse when it breaks its leg apparently while in its stall ; his dog dies ; the color on a painting he owns suddenly fades ; and roses he brings into the house die immediately . Ellen , who works with actuarial tables , is darn suspicious - there is too much bad luck , and either Jeff himself or someone who wants him destroyed is behind it . " The Second Woman " is a decent film with good , if unexciting , acting . Robert Young made several noirs in the ' 40s , and he did them well - you really don't know here if he's sinister or if he's a victim . Drake is a bland costar . Carnovsky , O'Neill , Sutton and Bates give good support . Sutton strikes the right note as a man who hates Jeff . Like dozens and dozens of post-World War II , there is an emphasis on psychology . Considering what our soldiers went through in World War II , it's not surprising that it was a hot topic . Here the big word is paranoia . But as anyone will tell you , just because you're paranoid doesn't mean someone's not out to get you .
494845	342623	26264	7.0	World War I love triangle	Frederic March , Merle Oberon , and Herbert Marshall comprise a love triangle in " The Dark Angel , " set in the grimness of World War I . Kitty ( Oberon ) has grown up with both Alan ( March ) and Gerald ( Marshall ) and knows the day will come when she must choose between them . She chooses Alan , but before they can be married , he's called back into service . With just a few hours left , she accompanies him to the meeting point for his troop and stays with him at the hotel . When Gerald , in the same troop , finds out that Alan was at the hotel with a woman , he turns against him , believing that he cheated on Kitty . He refuses him leave and sends him into treacherous battle . Merle Oberon gives a touching performance as Kitty . She's very beautiful and has a lovely presence . Both March and Marshall are very good , March having the more histrionic role . " The Dark Angel " comes off as dated and there's very much a " stiff upper lip , old chap " feeling about it . It's frustrating to see the Alan character behave as he does , but this of course keeps the viewer interested , and Oberon and the supporting characters infuse the atmosphere with warmth . Worth it to see these classic stars . " The Dark Angel " is an old chestnut but a worthy one .
493641	342623	35100	7.0	very funny Bob Hope movie	After swooning for quite some time on his radio show about Madeline Carroll , the actress , enjoying the publicity , approached him about being a guest on his show . Hope suggested that instead , they do a film together . The result is the delightful " My Favorite Blonde " about a British spy , Carroll , trying to deliver a coded message to Los Angeles . Attempting to escape German agents , she barges into a theater dressing room inhabited by Hope , who is performing as straight man to a penguin . Hope is a riot , with the wisecracks coming quickly throughout the film , and Carroll is a good leading lady for him - classy , serious , and the character she plays is game for anything to reach her goal . Gale Sondergaard has precious little to do - one wonders if her role was cut ; Dooley Wilson has an unspoken bit on the train ; and Bing Crosby directs Hope to a bus in one scene . Hope starts to walk away from him , stops , takes a beat and says to himself , " No . It couldn't be . " There are other in jokes as well - Hope turns the radio to his own show and turns it off , commenting , " I can't stand that guy . " As someone who was a young adult in the ' 60s , it wasn't kosher to like Bob Hope because of his politics , but I've always enjoyed his film performances . " My Favorite Blonde " is one of his best .
494042	342623	38924	7.0	British psychological drama	Ann Harding is a young girl who must take off " The Seventh Veil , " referring to the last veil of Salome , in this 1945 psychological drama also starring James Mason and Herbert Lom . Harding plays Francesca , who becomes the word of Nicholas ( Mason ) , a friend of her father's , when she is a young girl . Learning of her musical talent , Nicholas molds her into a first-class concert pianist , and she launches on a career . All the while , she is completely under his control . When she fell in love with a jazz musician , Nicholas took her to Paris to study . Once her career is in full bloom and she is of age , she falls in love with an artist and runs away with him . A terrible accident hospitalizes her , and after a suicide attempt , a psychiatrist ( Lom ) begins to work with her , as she now believes she cannot ever play the piano again . This is a very well-done film with excellent performances . Mason is passive , mysterious and intimidating as Nicholas , a man who also has an edge of violence when pushed too hard . There is a scene where he stands backstage and watches Francesca play the piano ; his face softens as he smiles , and the character reveals more of himself . As Francesca , the pretty Harding has the right mix of submission and then passion when she needs it . Lom , ever the chameleon , does a wonderful job as the psychiatrist . The music played by Francesca throughout the film is fantastic as is the somewhat dreary atmosphere in which Francesca lives . The ending is too abrupt but also in a way satisfying . One hopes that both Francesca and Nicholas are on their way to becoming whole people . Highly recommended .
494433	342623	373024	7.0	Derivative script lacks some punch	" Imaginary Heroes " is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver , Jeff Daniels , Emile Hirsch , Michelle Williams , and Kip Pardue . The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child ( Pardue ) commits suicide . " Ordinary People " has been mentioned often in relation to this film ; it's sort of " Ordinary People " with a role reversal . The mother in this case , Sandy Travis ( Weaver ) is more accessible than the father , Ben ( Daniels ) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope . Like " Ordinary People , " the younger son Tim ( Hirsch ) is the focus of the film . For me , the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it . There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son , mother and neighbor , brother and sister ( Williams ) and some good offbeat moments . What never clicked was Ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with Sandy . This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris . In one scene in a grocery store , the checkout kid assumes Sandy is " about 30 " and gives her his phone number . In almost the next scene , Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday . Weaver was 55 when this film was made , actually probably 54 , and looks phenomenal . So what is Ben looking at ? However , there's something askew about Ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how Daniels ever WAS attached to that family . The end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes . Everyone is very good , with Weaver and Hirsch being the standouts . There's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares . The script could have been sharper . But " Imaginary Heroes " is a good effort .
494646	342623	35020	7.0	surprisingly timely	Henry Fonda is a college professor in danger of losing his job and his wife in " The Male Animal , " also starring Olivia de Havilland , Jack Carson , and Joan Leslie . Fonda plays a happily married intellectual . On the weekend of college homecoming , his wife's former beau ( Jack Carson ) , a jock , shows up , giving rise to the professor's insecurities . He's having problems in his teaching life as well when an editorial states that he plans to read a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti ( of Sacco and Vanzetti ) in his English composition class . The trustees aren't happy and want him to state that the article is incorrect . As he is up for a full professorship , his wife hopes he will back down also since three teachers have been fired for being " reds . " This is an odd film with a very timely message about censorship and its dangers that by itself would have made a good movie , especially with wonderful actors like Fonda and de Havilland . However , the home situation was played for comedy . This film didn't seem to know which it was . If I were to guess , I would say the studio wanted a comedy and the dramatic part was downplayed . It's a shame , because there was nothing special about that part of the film , except that Jack Carson was very good . The Henry Fonda character discovers that he has to become " the male animal , " i . e . , one who fiercely protects his home , and not only his home , but his role as a teacher as well . Today , when " Brokeback Mountain " isn't being shown in all areas , and more censorship is being urged , this is a good movie to see if only to remind us that the this is a war that has been fought for years . Nowadays I wonder if we're winning .
494495	342623	26421	7.0	More Busby and an early glimpse at an actress of ' Titanic ' proportions	" Golddiggers of 1935 " stars Alice Brady as a cheapskate determined that her daughter will marry a wealthy older man as planned . In order to make sure this happens , she gives her daughter a last wish as a single woman , which is to let her do what she wants ( i . e . , have fun ) all summer at the resort where they're staying . So mom hires the student doctor at the reception desk , Dick ( Dick Powell ) to escort her around . Oh , and then there's the show for the milk fund . And what a show ! The daughter in question is the beautiful Gloria Stuart , who a mere 60 + years later will receive an Oscar nomination for " Titanic " and make it at last ! 96 at the time of this writing , Stuart today is completely recognizable as that dazzling blond of her youth . There's no mistaking those incredible eyes or wonderful voice . It was really a treat to see her in this . The film is remarkable for its milk fund numbers only - the rest of it isn't much . Berkeley pulled out all the stops with a mesmerizing array of moving white pianos played by chorus girls in gowns , and follows it up with " Lullaby of Broadway . " Sensational - so imaginative , dark , and atmospheric , truly one of the best numbers in cinema . Its unusual beginning ( also done at the end ) will cue you in immediately that you're about to see something different . The cast is first rate - Powell , Stuart , Brady , Hugh Herbert , Dorothy Dare , Glenda Farrell , and Adolphe Menjou . Parts of it are overacted , almost as if the actors were on stage , but you won't be sorry you saw Berkeley's work at its best .
494570	342623	47969	7.0	Beautiful dance film with stunning stars	How terribly sad that during such a delightful and romantic film , Fred Astaire was mourning the death of his wife . " Daddy Long Legs " is a sweet film with an utterly charming performance , in words and dance , by Leslie Caron , and Astaire's usual high-class , debonair , energetic work . Thelma Ritter and Larry Keating give fantastic support , and in looking over the cast list , I see that a future dance partner of Astaire's , the wonderful Barrie Chase , is an uncredited dancer . My only complaint is that the movie is on the long side , with the final dance being not only terribly long , but just one dance sequence too many . The highlight of the film for me was definitely " Sluefoot . " A fantastic number ! I noticed one hilarious comment about an " uncredited appearance by Cary Grant . " I remember my mom telling me how much Ray Anthony resembled Grant - I guess she was right !
495156	342623	39288	7.0	Two great stars in a disappointing film	Barbara Stanwyck smells something rotten in her husband's family home in " Cry Wolf , " a 1947 movie starring a very famous wolf off screen , Errol Flynn , as well as Jerome Cowan , Richard Basehart , and Geraldine Brooks . Stanwyck plays Sandra , the widow of James Demarest , and arrives to consult with his uncle ( Flynn ) about James ' estate . James believed that his uncle was trying to take his money from him . She gets a cool reception from everyone except James ' sister ( Brooks ) . Hearing noises coming from the uncle's lab , Sandra becomes convinced that James is still alive , and she is determined to gain access to the laboratory . This is the kind of film you can't wait to see - two fabulous stars , a mystery , atmosphere - but though " Cry Wolf " screams " Cry Hit Movie " - it falls flat . If Flynn is supposed to be the Max de Winter or Mr . Rochester of the piece , he doesn't cut it . It's not his fault . The role does not play to his strengths at all . Incredibly handsome , charming , energetic , and debonair , Flynn was one of the greatest stars of the golden era . It's understandable that he became bored with the kind of roles with which he is associated , and there's no doubt he could have pulled this off , but the script and direction let him down . Instead , his performance seems one note , uninteresting , and lazy . At 38 , given his lifestyle , he looked bloated in certain scenes . It would seem like a wonderful idea to cast him with Stanwyck , but there's no there there . Stanwyck's role , on the other hand , does play to her strengths . She's tough , determined , and called upon to do some amazing physical stunts as she rides up and down in a dumbwaiter , rides horses , falls off of one , takes one over a tall fence - she's just great . Given the lethargy of Flynn's performance and the quiet steel of Stanwyck's , Geraldine Brooks by contrast seems like she's chewing the scenery . Basehart is so young he's almost unrecognizable in a small but good role . The film ends very abruptly with most of the plot telegraphed from the beginning of the film . However , there are some wonderfully suspenseful moments - Stanwyck hiding outside the lab as Flynn exits , the horse careening through the woods , and several others . Enjoyable , disappointing , but well worth seeing for the stars and the atmosphere .
493621	342623	289992	7.0	strong and involving	The Life of David Gale is not meant to be taken as realistic , for clearly , it is not . Although extremely convoluted , it is nevertheless compelling and keeps you guessing up until the very end . This is not a simplistic plot , but one that the viewer must follow carefully . This viewer was left with a couple of questions , in fact . Kevin Spacey's lecture to his students near the beginning of the film , and his monologue to Kate Winslett toward the end of the film are the bookends for a marvelous performance ; what he lacks in warmth , he makes up for in wryness and in the way he colors his performance . Laura Linney was her usual marvelous self . The beautiful Kate Winslett was excellent , her strongest scenes coming later on in the film . One thing that struck me was that the first 15 minutes seemed to be written by someone else . They are definitely not as good as the rest of the movie - the dialogue is awkward and Winslett definitely seems to be establishing a very stereotypical character - the beautiful but bitchy and ambitious reporter who feels the sting of sexism . Fortunately this script awkwardness faded quickly .
494503	342623	65950	7.0	ahead of its time	Agents are sent from the west to retrieve " The Kremlin Letter " in this 1970 film directed by John Huston and starring Patrick O'Neal , Richard Boone , George Sanders , Orson Welles , Max von Sydow , Barbara Parkins , Dean Jagger , and Bibi Andersson . O'Neal plays Rone , who is removed from military service and put on the mission because of his photographic memory . Each man and Parkins , who is a safecracker sent in place of her arthritic father , is assigned a group to infiltrate , all with the objective of finding this anti-Chinese letter . Or is that what the assignment is really about ? This is an extremely cold and vicious look at the spy game - it's no fun caper film . It's absorbing , moves quickly and is filled with marvelous , if not altogether likable characters . The last moment in the film will leave you breathless . With a cast like this , the acting should be uniformly excellent , and it is , with the not-so-talented but beautiful Parkins given a role where she doesn't have to do any scenery chewing . George Sanders is especially memorable as the spy assigned to the gay contingent . O'Neal underplays , which is ideal for his character . Many people on this board won't remember that Richard Boone was a prominent western TV star who had aspirations of being taken seriously as an actor . In fact , he even started some sort of repetory company , as I recall . He was very talented , and here plays the head man to perfection , blond hair , down-home accent and all . Very intriguing , done at a time when spy films were a dime a dozen . " The Kremlin Letter " stands out for its detachment and lack of sentiment .
494853	342623	324948	7.0	Entertaining look at a great studio	" 20th Century Fox : The First 50 Years , " narrated by James Coburn , gives us a history of the studio's dual beginnings , merger , and success as a great Hollywood studio under the aegis of the ambitious Darryl F . Zanuck . There are wonderful clips and homages to some of the stars that made 20th Century Fox great : Will Rogers , Shirley Temple , Tyrone Power , Betty Grable , Henry Fonda , Alice Faye , Don Ameche et al . What's usually missing in these compilations is depth because so much has to be covered , but in this case , they did an okay job . There were also brief comments by stars such as Alice Faye and Roddy McDowell . Of special interest were the early sound tests and a look at the development of Fox's sound system . The early sound clips featured two very young actors , Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy . 20th Century Fox is a particularly fascinating studio because around the late ' 50s , the lunatics started taking over the asylum , the Cleopatra debacle being a great example as well as all the problems with Marilyn Monroe . There are some clips from the film she did not complete , " Something's Gotta Give , " that are great . That fact is , the radiant Monroe was always a problem , as anyone who has ever seen a documentary on Billy Wilder will attest . It's just that once a woman hit 30 in Hollywood - let alone travel down the road past it - the powers that be started to lose patience . The previous poster mentioned the fickleness of trends as demonstrated by this documentary . I submit it's not the fickleness of trends but of the studios who put some of these great stars out to pasture and / or treated them badly after they'd kept the studios solvent . Since 20th Century Fox is the subject , here are a few examples not mentioned . Alice Faye left because of the hatchet job done on her role in the film " Fallen Angel " in favor of Linda Darnell ; there was a small clip shown of " Nightmare Alley , " with no explanation that Tyrone Power pleaded with Zanuck to make it , and when Zanuck saw it , he was so terrified for Power's image that he withdrew it from distribution and never publicized it . Nice way to treat somebody who gave you hit after hit after hit . It also isn't mentioned that after " Marie Antoinette , " Zanuck refused to lend Power out - not for Ashley in " Gone with the Wind , " not for the " The Last Tycoon , " which was as a result not made until many years later , not to Harry Cohn , who was desperate to get him for anything . Linda Darnell was of no use to Zanuck when she got married and couldn't play virginal roles anymore , though to her credit , she staged a sexy comeback . And on and on . Despite its self-serving theme , " 20th Century Fox : The First 50 Years " is interesting and entertaining , though a little long . The producers also could have dug a little deeper for unusual clips and paid a little more attention to the clips that were shown . Not everyone has seen " Laura " - was it necessary to show the murderer ?
494472	342623	40153	7.0	Pretty good B movie	Richard Carlson goes " Behind Locked Doors " in this 1948 film also starring Lucille Bremer . Carlson plays detective Ross Stewart who enters an insane asylum as a patient at the behest of a reporter Kathy Lawrence ( Bremer ) to find a judge who is on the lam from the police . For his trouble , there is a $10 , 000 reward , which he and Lawrence will split , but she has to make sure the Judge is in the asylum first . They play man and wife , and she has him committed . Once inside , Stewart discovers that the place is run somewhat inhumanely , and that the judge may be in a ward of the asylum that is locked and inaccessible to other patients . This is a B movie all the way with decent performances by Carlson and Bremer , Douglas Fowley and Tor Johnson and good direction by Budd Boetticher . I sort of hoped that , although the Bremer character was on the trail of the judge , that she might have been interested in some of the bad conditions at the asylum and wanted to expose them . Though things don't stay as they are there , it would have been nice if earlier , she had mentioned having any interest in it . Guess she just wanted the big story . Good but not exceptional .
494559	342623	25251	7.0	Life on a farm	Robert Montgomery plays a gangster hiding out on a farm in " Hide-Out , " a 1934 film also starring Maureen O'Sullivan , Edward Arnold , Elizabeth Patterson , Whitford Kane , and Mickey Rooney . With the police after him , Lucky Wilson takes off but ends up shot and unconscious . He is then found by a farmer Miller ( Kane ) who takes him home . There , Lucky , now calling himself by his real name , Jonathan , meets a normal American family , including an above-normal looking Pauline ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) , who is the daughter of the house . Jonathan stretches out his recovery and begins to enjoy the idyllic life of milking cows , feeding chickens , romancing Pauline , and being sort of a big brother to her younger sibling Willie ( Mickey Rooney ) . This is a sweet film with nothing special to recommend it except the beautiful young O'Sullivan and an amusing performance by Montgomery . In one of the best scenes , he sits at a ringside table and asks a singer out - while she's singing - and she answers him under her breath during short orchestral interludes . The end seems a little abrupt , but this is a pleasant film . If Mrs . Miller looks familiar , she was Mrs . Trumbull , the neighbor who babysat Little Ricky on " I Love Lucy . "
493648	342623	36187	7.0	neat little programmer	" The Mysterious Doctor " is an enjoyable , atmospheric B movie about a unmine-able tin mine in Morgan's Head , England , due to the presence of a headless ghost . It's wartime and the country needs the tin , but no amount of persuading can get the workers back after so many people have been killed by the spirit , which goes back to a local legend in the town . It sure feels and looks British , and the cast includes a young , vibrant Eleanor Parker who fits right in with actors John Loder and others . This is an excellent little wartime gem . Don't miss it when it's on TCM .
493789	342623	131325	7.0	A desperate producer makes a film , but the star doesn't know he's the star	Steve Martin is a producer with what he considers a great script - - " Chubby Rain " - in " Bowfinger , " a 1999 film also starring Eddie Murphy , Heather Graham , Terrence Stamp and Christine Baranski . Martin , who wrote the screenplay , is Bobby Bowfinger , a producer who is convinced that he has a hot sci fi property and wants Kit Ramsey ( Murphy ) , a huge action star , to be his lead . ( The script , by the way , sounds awful . ) He has no way of getting to Kit , but he tries - and fails . Then he decides to make the film starring Kit anyway , except that Kit won't know it . He has a cast that has been on hold for months , and he rounds it out by holding auditions for $25 each ( no checks ) . Here he finds his leading lady ( Graham ) and his - and everybody else in the cast and on the crew's - future girlfriend . His parking attendant friend can steal fancy cars for him , and he has another friend who can steal cameras and sound equipment . And he can get a top crew by going out in a van and picking up illegals trying to cross the border . He's set . Bobby tells his cast that Kit won't meet anyone and doesn't want to see the camera , and then stakes out Kit's house , finds out where he's having lunch , etc . , and has his actors walking up to Kit and saying lines about aliens , screaming at him or chasing his car . Little do they know , Kit is a little paranoid when it comes to extraterrestrials . He's a member of a mind cult , run by Terrence Stamp , who keeps having him repeat that there are no aliens . As the filming continues and Kit is continually approached by aliens , Stamp sends him on an enforced vacation . That's when Bobby hires a Kit lookalike named Jiff ( also Eddie Murphy ) . This is a preposterous story that's done well enough so that you can believe it could work , and it's a great premise . I may be a sap , but I found the end when everyone is watching the final film very touching . There are some hilarious moments and lots of satire from a very funny cast . Very enjoyable .
494888	342623	35982	7.0	Entertaining film with Faye and Payne	Alice Faye's reign at 20th Century Fox , which overlapped with Betty Grable's , started earlier than Grable's and ended sooner - and on a sour note . Faye actually came with the old Fox Film Corp . when Zanuck founded 20th Century Fox and was at first a Harlow type , eventually developing into the Alice Faye moviegoers came to love . When she was given a dramatic role , in the 1945 " Dark Angel , " the film was re-edited to favor Linda Darnell , and a disgusted Faye left Fox and never returned . Here she's on top in " Hello Frisco , Hello " also starring John Payne , Lynn Bari , Jack Oakie , June Havoc and Laird Cregar , a big , colorful turn of the century musical in the Fox tradition . Alice plays Trudy Evans , the linchpin in a group formed by the ambitious Johnny Cornell . Johnny isn't content with the Barbary Coast - he wants Nob Hill . After opening a series of clubs , he becomes interested in a beautiful widow ( Bari ) who can give him the respectability he wants . When she goes broke , he tries to buy her house . To the heartbreak of Trudy , who's been in love with him all along , the two eventually marry . There's one song after another in this musical , including Faye's beautiful rendition of " You'll Never Know , " which became a smash hit . Faye's voice was so unusual - low , sultry and smooth , and it fits the music here perfectly . She is beautifully photographed and costumed as well . Oakie and Havoc provide comic support , and Bari is excellent as the woman who wins Johnny away from Trudy . The big problem with the film is the character of Johnny ( Payne ) , who is a real louse and a user to boot as he strings Trudy along . Personally , I would have let him stew in his own juice but this is Hollywood after all . And the plot is so secondary to the wonderful music and stars . Highly entertaining .
494577	342623	29284	7.0	Funny if flawed comedy starring one of Hollywood's best screen teams	Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together , and though " My Favorite Wife " is not as funny as " The Awful Truth , " it's still pretty good . Ellen , lost at sea and presumed dead , returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried . She goes to his honeymoon hotel , which is a setup for one of Grant's best bits - he sees her as the elevator is closing and his head follows the door until it closes . However , he can't seem to tell his bride Bianca ( Gail Patrick ) . Then he finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on the island but spent the 7 years with one Stephen Burkett . In another funny scene , Ellen gets a sheepish , short , bald shoe salesman to pose as Burkett . Nick has tracked the real Burkett down , and Stephen looks a lot more like Randolph Scott than the shoe salesman . In fact , he's played by Randolph Scott . Grant is his usual riot and extremely handsome . He spends a lot of time talking to himself as he acts out what he's going to say to Bianca . Also , as in " Bringing Up Baby " and " I Was a Male War Bride , " he gets to do something with women's clothing - this time standing in front a mirror and trying to figure out what to bring Ellen to wear . Dunne is very funny , posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca , and also is quite touching when she first sees her children . The only problem is that it all gets a little tired , particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic . As others have pointed out , the script has some holes , particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity . And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim . Go figure . As amusing as " My Favorite Wife " is , it could have been better . Nevertheless , with these stars , it's a delightful film , and some of the funniest scenes take place in the courtroom . The Judge , played by Granville Bates , is hilarious and a good example of " no small parts . " He sure makes the most of his role .
493504	342623	461688	7.0	True story becomes a TV movie	I read the magazine story on which " Murder in the Hamptons " is based , but alas , when I sat down to watch this movie , I didn't recall much of it . Starring Poppy Montgomery as Generosa Rand Ammon , the movie tells the story of the Ammon family - Ted , Generosa , and their adopted twins - and the horrific murder of Ted in their palatial Hamptons home - a case that stayed open for a long time before an arrest was made . Generosa is an attractive artist when she meets Ted Ammon and marries him . After a while , it becomes evident that she's wound a little too tightly on one hand and one sandwich short of a picnic on the other . Her paranoia becomes worse and worse as time goes on , and she and Ammon eventually separate as she becomes convinced that he's cheating on her and has an illegitimate child . Neither of which was apparently true . She soon takes up with an electrician , Daniel Pelosi , who is renovating her house . Generosa is presented as an extremely disturbed woman . She emotionally abuses her children , she brainwashes them against their father , and she keeps Ted's sister from seeing the kids . She has surveillance bugs planted in the Hampton house so she can watch all of Ted's activities on a laptop - which after the murder was never found . Though it's a fascinating case , " Murder in the Hamptons " is the stuff of routine TV movies as it meanders through the story . Montgomery is very good , acting completely normal in her scenes - as a result of her demeanor , one then never knows when Generosa is going to totally lose it , so you're waiting for the next blow-up . The rest of the performances are okay , with the nanny giving an especially chilling performance . Naturally there are things that were omitted , and for some reason , Pelosi is presented in a decent light . In fact he's a total waste . Also , assuming the will referenced near the end of the movie was filed in New York State - which it was - it's not possible to eliminate one's husband from a will . You can disinherit a child in your will as long as you specifically mention them by name . But no matter what your will directs , your husband is entitled to a third of the estate . So that business was a foolish plot device . Stick to the facts - they're usually more interesting .
493945	342623	44552	7.0	brisk Cold War drama	Tyrone Power stars as a courier put in an awkward situation by the U . S . government in " Diplomatic Courier , " which also stars Patricia Neal and Hildegarde Knef . Neal has a small but showy role as a society widow who chases Power around Europe . The film was shot on location in Europe , possibly using post-war blocked funds that caused so many films to be made there in the ' 50s and beyond . I first saw this film on TV as a kid , and like one of the other posters , it stuck in my mind , possibly because even back then , I was a Tyrone Power fan . The early ' 50s were a transition time for him . Unlike some actors - Bogart , Mitchum , Gable , to name a few - Power changed dramatically over the years . By the time this film was made , he had lost the last vestige of his boyishness and was thoroughly disillusioned with movies and undoubtedly the master he had served since 1936 , 20th Century Fox . In the few years he had left , he would turn more and more to theater and form his own movie production company . Some of his best work lay ahead of him . Power is supported in the film with a vigorous performance by Karl Malden and from newcomer Hildegarde Knef . Talented and beautiful , Knef , like many other European actresses who came to Hollywood after the war , never found a niche in Hollywood . She went on to great success on Broadway , however , with " Silk Stockings , " the musical version of " Ninotchka , " costarring Don Ameche , and remained friends with Power . Patricia Neal plays a widow that Power meets on an airplane . He keeps standing her up when they're supposed to get together but the story takes it a little further . Neal was an ardent fan of Power's and when they met , she asked him why it was that he hadn't answered her fan letter . Diplomatic Courier is a fast-moving , atmospheric film where you can't tell the good guys from the bad , and it holds interest . Watch for a Lee Marvin in a small role and an uncredited moment by Charles Bronson .
495005	342623	40669	7.0	Robert Walker meets a heavenly goddess	During and after World War II , fantasy was big in Hollywood . It wasn't just escapism ; it was all the thinking about death as many loved ones were lost . It's no wonder we had so many people coming back ( " Here Comes Mr . Jordan " ) , facing the pearly gates or the hotter ones ( " Heaven Can Wait " ) , or meeting angels in human form ( " The Bishop's Wife " ) . We also had a visits from the big goddesses . How fitting that two women closest to being goddesses in human form actually played them - Rita Hayworth as Terpsichore in 1947's " Down to Earth , " and of course , Ava Gardner as Venus in " One Touch of Venus . " " One Touch of Venus " is based on the Broadway musical of the same name that was revived in London a few years ago with Melissa Errico , but never came to New York . Alas , there aren't many songs in this version but the most famous song , " Speak Low When You Speak Love " remains . The film stars Gardner , Robert Walker , Dick Haymes , Olga San Juan , Tom Conway , and Eve Arden . Walker works in a department store where a magnificent statue of Venus is about to be unveiled . On an impulse , he kisses it , and she comes to life . He falls madly in love with her , while his girlfriend ( San Juan ) flips out for his friend ( Haymes ) . When the statue is discovered missing , the police assume that Walker knows something about it , since he was fixing the presentation curtain and claims that she then came to life . Walker is an energetic delight as he chases Venus . After this film , he was institutionalized , and by 1951 , his boyishness was gone as he entered what should have been the greatest part of his career with a magnificent performance in " Strangers on a Train . " Instead , he only made one more film after that , dying in 1951 . Looking at him in " One Touch of Venus , " it's hard to imagine he had any demons . Eve Arden is hilarious as the secretary in unrequited love with her boss , Tom Conway . He's seen Venus sleeping in the home department and fallen for her as well . Haymes sings beautifully , and San Juan is pert and pretty as a young woman suddenly torn between two men . But all eyes are on Ava Gardner's dazzling beauty . She's a perfect embodiment of Venus with her flawless face , figure , and soft voice . Even though as a younger woman she had tried singing with a band , she wasn't a singer , so her voice is dubbed in this by Eileen Wilson . Like Hayworth , early in her career , she sometimes played roles that required vocals , and like Hayworth , she was always dubbed . The best scene in the film takes place in the park toward the end . It's exuberant and thrilling - you won't want it to end . That scene sums up this lovely fantasy with a divine Ava , and you can't get any better than that .
494303	342623	44502	7.0	A flop Clifford Odets play makes a strong film	Barbara Stanwyck , Paul Douglas , Robert Ryan , Marilyn Monroe , and Keith Andes star in " Clash by Night , " based on the play by Clifford Odets that flopped on Broadway . It gets the full-blown treatment on the screen , with Fritz Lang directing and a strong group of actors . Stanwyck is a world-weary woman who comes back to her roots because " home is where you go when you run out of places , " and immediately attracts male attention from both Ryan and Paul Douglas . She's instantly attracted to Ryan , and each recognizes in the other an edginess and need for excitement . To fight these urges , which haven't brought her any joy in the past , she marries Douglas , a simple fisherman who is deeply in love with her . It's not long before she gets antsy . The acting is terrific , but the emotions are very big - possibly too big for the screen and more suited to the stage . Though everyone is excellent , Douglas has the sympathetic role and breaks your heart as the cuckolded husband . Ryan is great as a volcano waiting to erupt , and Stanwyck's portrayal is ferociously honest and layered . She was 45 at the time of thee filming and obviously playing someone a good 10 years younger , but it still works . Marilyn Monroe has a supporting role playing the girlfriend of handsome Keith Andes . He mainly shows off his physique , though he was actually a good actor who had success in TV and was also a powerful singer , playing opposite Lucille Ball on Broadway in " Wildcat . " Monroe , mostly in jeans and with a swimsuit scene , is beautiful and her acting is very natural . Later on in her career , she overpronounced her words , which worked well in comedy but less so in drama . This is a very good movie with vigorous direction by Lang . There's just not much about it that's subtle .
495032	342623	29087	7.0	Marlene looks great no matter what	Robert Donat is a British spy who is a " Knight Without Armor " in this 1937 Alexander Korda film , also starring Marlene Dietrich as a widowed Countess . Donat is A . J . Fothergill , a Brit in Russia who is recruited to spy on the revolutionary movement in 1913 because of his knowledge of the language . After being imprisoned in Siberia , he's released due to the 1917 revolution . As an assistant to a commissar he met in Siberia , he is assigned to the takeover of the estate of Countess Alexandra ( Dietrich ) . He has to take her to Petrograd , and ultimately , they fall in love . He then attempts to get her out of the country . A very good and absorbing film with Donat and the beautiful Dietrich giving wonderful performances as they trudge through Mother Russia . Be she in peasant clothes , babushka , nightgown , wedding gown , or evening gown , Dietrich looks fabulous , makeup intact . The most stunning scene takes place in the beginning when she wakes up in her gorgeous bedroom and rings for her maid . No maid . She gets up and searches the house . Nobody . She goes outside in her long white flowing nightgown , hair loose . Nothing . She spots her maid and calls to her . The maid runs . Dietrich turns around to see the entire horizon covered with soldiers coming at her . Fabulous . There are many wonderful scenes , including a crowd stopping a train , that really capture the feeling of the chaos , panic , and dirt of war . Robert Donat is marvelous , elegant of voice , sometimes a character actor and sometimes , with a wavy lock of hair on his forehead and kissing Dietrich , a very effective romantic leading man . Very exciting film , and you really care about these characters . Highly recommended .
495003	342623	44324	7.0	The personal side of a controversial moment in history	" Above and Beyond " stars Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker and chronicles the story of Paul Tibbets , the man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima in 1945 . The event today , seen with modern eyes , is more unsavory than it was to people who lived in the midst of World War II . I watched the film with a skewed perspective unheard of in the ' 40s , as I interviewed Hiroshima survivors some years ago and discussed the event and their various health problems with them . Known as the " hibachi , " they are human beings like everybody else . But as we all know , in war , human life is cheap , especially as far as warring governments are concerned . The story as told in " Above and Beyond " is factually correct . The focus is not just on the technical details of outfitting the planes , the training , the secrecy , the testing , etc . , but also on Tibbets ' personal life . I read Tibbets married in 1953 or 1954 , but I did not learn if he had a wife at the time of Hiroshima . In this movie , he had a wife and two small children . The high security of the base , the constant pressure of Tibbets ' work , and the weight of the act he was to perform put a strain on his marriage and his relationships with friends . I suspect most of the personal life aspects of the film were heavily fictionalized . First of all , in the movie , the character of Tibbets is deeply conflicted about his assignment . In real life , Tibbets never had a moment of regret . Secondly , one would think a military wife would have understood that if security was so high and her husband was abrupt and tense - and there was a war on - there must be a reason other than " he's changed . " Instead , he is accused by her of " playing it too big . " She even takes her confusion to one of his bosses , who , instead of saying , " Your husband is working on something important and is under a lot of pressure , " gives her no help at all . But that was probably to get her off of the airbase . Robert Taylor was about 40 when this movie was made . It was a different world then - cigarettes and the lack of an eyelift robbed him of his boyish beauty , but he was still ruggedly handsome and does well in the role . Taylor wasn't a great actor , nor was he a bad one . Like his 20th Century Fox counterpart , Tyrone Power , he suffered at the hands of the critics because of his outrageous good looks , but he was always believable in the right role . Eleanor Parker is lovely and effective as his wife . The film was obviously meant to show the action of dropping the bomb and to put the character of Tibbets in a sympathetic light . The stars are likable , it's thought provoking , and of some interest . It has , of course , the Robert Alda as Gershwin moment - you know , " I'll write a rhapsody - a Rhapsody in Blue " when Tibbets is asked what he wants to name the plane , and he decides on " Enola Gay . " It's for historians to say if in actuality this horrendous event by the Enola Gay shortened the war and saved lives , and they've been arguing about it for years . I can't say . I didn't live through the war ; I just interviewed some of its victims .
493678	342623	40553	7.0	Lovely fantasy	Tyrone Power is a man who encounters a leprechaun in " The Luck of the Irish , " also starring Anne Baxter , Jayne Meadows Cecil Kellaway , and Lee J . Cobb . Power plays Stephen Fitzgerald , a newspaperman who takes a job with an influential publisher turned politician , Augur ( Cobb ) - not because he believes in Augur , but because of the money and prestige . Egging him on is Augur's elegant , glamorous daughter ( Meadows ) who's in love with him . And who can blame her . It's outrageously handsome and charming Tyrone Power . While in Ireland , Fitz meets a young woman , Nora , to whom he's attracted , and a leprechaun with the proverbial pot o ' gold . Even though Fitz gets the gold , he returns it , and the leprechaun is in his debt . When Fitz returns to New York , the leprechaun appears as a servant , Horace , and strange things begin to happen . This is a charming film that effortlessly draws you into its whimsical story . Power did many comedies when he first signed with 20th Century Fox , and if you've seen them , you know he performed them beautifully . His reactions while a bartender is telling a leprechaun story are hilarious . It's a shame this versatile actor didn't put down his sword and do more comic roles . He'd pay homage once again to the land of his ancestors in " The Long Gray Line " for John Ford seven years later . How sad that when the really good parts were finally coming his way , he died . Anne Baxter is darling as Nora , and Meadows is appropriately brittle . The two are great opposites - Baxter natural and sweet , Meadows made up and bejeweled . Kellaway is excellent as Horace , the leprechaun turned houseman . " The Luck of the Irish " will leave you with a smile on your face . Uplifting stories are hard to find - see this one .
493517	342623	59798	7.0	Growing up is hard to do , especially when you're already an adult	" A Thousand Clowns " was a ' 60s Broadway hit that starred Jason Robards , who repeats his role for the film , as does William Daniels . It has been revived several times , the last time for , of all people , Tom Selleck . I suppose it was cast that way because the lead role , Murray , is an overgrown kid , kind of like Magnum . The casting people seemed to forget that Murray is a New Yorker and Jewish besides . Tom Selleck was skewered by critics , in part because he was miscast and in part because he's not a stage actor . The Herb Gardner play concerns a twelve-year-old boy , Nick , who lives with his eccentric Uncle Murray . A social worker ( Barbara Harris ) appears ; she and Murray fall for one another . Child welfare insists that Murray become a traditional working man if he wants to keep his nephew , who loves being with him . Young Nick is horrified when his uncle seems to accept their decision instead of fighting it . " A Thousand Clowns " is a thought-provoking film , done at a time when rebellion was something to be admired . Underneath it all , what it's really about is growing up ; in fact , Nick acts older than his uncle in many ways . Murray wants freedom , but he needs to change his definition of freedom if he wants his nephew . Jason Robards does a terrific job as Murray , an unemployed TV writer and fun guy for sure , more big brother than father material with his cluttered apartment , eternal joking , going to the movies instead of looking for a job , inability to commit to a relationship , and basic refusal to work . The marvelous Barbara Harris takes the role of the social worker , played on stage by Sandy Dennis . She's great as the dizzy woman who splits with her boring , by the book fiancé to be with Murray . Barry Gordon , who is still acting today , makes an excellent , forceful , and funny Nick , and manages to project a vulnerability underneath the New York kid . Martin Balsam plays Murray's straightlaced brother and rounds off a fine cast . Though dated , " A Thousand Clowns " is still a good watch , about love , responsibility , and rebellion .
495119	342623	101602	7.0	disappointing Columbo	I gave this a 7 because of the great cast and some wonderful scenes , but it's a problematic script . And let's face it , the alibi is absolutely no good . Dabney Coleman is an attorney with live-in girlfriend / rock star whom he kills . He then frames her boyfriend for the murder . One of the best things is that when Columbo hears her name , he knows what her hit song is ! There's another hilarious scene in a restaurant where Coleman asks Columbo if he wants something to eat . Well , he starts ordering and just keeps on going , seemingly every new item being an afterthought - it's priceless . Someone posted that Shera Danese ( Falk's wife ) who plays an associate in Coleman's law firm could not have provided the alibi , because she starts blackmailing him after the event . I believe she did what he asked her to do without realizing why - when she realizes why , she starts blackmailing him . I may be wrong - I don't have the episode in front of me . My REAL problem with this episode is the fact that I've never understood how anybody could drive with that mask on . It did not look opaque to me . It looked like a photograph . Some trivia : Falk's real-life wife , Shera Danese , wanted to play the girlfriend but was felt to be too old for the role . She MAY have sung the song , I can't remember now .
494662	342623	59263	7.0	Based on a true story of the Norwegian resistance	" The Heroes of Telemark " is a 1965 film telling the story of the great bravery of people in the Norwegian resistance during World War II as they attempt to keep material for the atom bomb out of the hands of the Nazis . It stars Kirk Douglas , Richard Harris , Michael Redgrave and Ulla Jacobsen . This is a strange film for several reasons . It has some tremendous people in it yet they aren't really used effectively , i . e . , Michael Redgrave and Ulla Jacobsen as examples , gorgeous scenery and skiing sequences that aren't particularly well photographed ; and a story that includes inaccuracies rather than the true facts . Certainly one can understand the need to combine characters or cut out segments of a story , but when the actual event is as thrilling as the real story of Telemark , why change it ? Several people have commented , as usual , about actors having no accents , most especially Kirk Douglas as a Norwegian scientist . In films , it's more difficult to keep to the theatrical convention , but nevertheless , it is correct : When a film takes place in another country and characters from and in that country are speaking , they ARE NOT SPEAKING English . They are speaking German , Norwegian , whatever . So the convention is - NO ACCENT . Why would Norwegians be in Norway speaking to other Norwegians in English ? Why would they be speaking English to Germans ? They wouldn't be . A good example is the film " The Mortal Storm . " It takes place in Germany , and Margaret Sullavan , James Stewart , and Robert Young speak with no accents . CORRECT . The problem in Hollywood is that they cast some people who are American and some people who are from other countries , making the accent situation difficult . Be that as it may , Kirk Douglas did not need an accent and it was correct that he did not have one . And he can't slip in and out of one - speak with an accent when in England , for instance , because that would be ridiculous . Despite the fact that this film has its drawbacks , it is nevertheless good , with some exciting sequences . It just wasn't very well directed by Anthony Mann , who makes the pace too leisurely . It would have been a better film with more attention to the true facts , a little more characterization , and a faster pace .

Hepburn gives her usual intelligent performance , showing a vulnerable , feminine side that is very appealing . There is a scene in a fitting room where she is absolutely stunning . The scenes between her and her father , played by Edmund Gwenn , were delightful and realistic , as she complains that Taylor could not be attracted to her . " Look at me , " she demands , " what do you see ? " Her father smiles and says " Beautiful " and kisses her . It's this type of gentleness coupled with good acting , underlying suspense and excitement that makes Undercurrent a very good - - and very underrated - ' 40s film . Taylor is handsome and enigmatic in his role . Somewhere along the way , he stumbled into playing bad boys , as he does later on in " Conspirator " as well , and these roles suit him . Hepburn once said that Spencer Tracy made her seem very feminine ; Taylor does too . I have to add that I did find the casting quite odd but inspired , with Hepburn and Mitchum cast against type , and Hepburn paired with Taylor . I wish we had seen more of this in Hollywood .
493725	342623	382625	8.0	Tom Hanks and the Holy Grail	Right off , I admit to not having read the book " The Da Vinci Code " but I was familiar with the story before seeing the film . Due to the lackluster reviews this movie received , I decided to rent it rather than rush out and see it . I find sometimes that films not well received in the theater do better as rentals . I'm not sure why . It may be the shelling out of so much money to see a film nowadays . Nevertheless , I suspect I had a better experience than some people . I won't bother to repeat the story , but I am one person who did not find this film dull , lackluster , or felt like nothing was happening . I found it suspenseful and interesting , with good performances , Ian McKellan being a standout . The scenery was stunning , as was the musical score - the whole look and sound was that of a very big money production , which of course it was . I liked both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou - Hanks never imposes himself on the material , so he didn't try to make more of the Robert Langdon character than is there - which isn't much . Just about anyone could have played the part . Hanks was the icing on an expensive cake . Audrey Tatou was very good in her role . But these parts take a back seat to the intricate and controversial story . " The Da Vinci Code " is provocative , exciting , and well done . My only complaint is that it had several of what I call false endings - i . e . , you think the film is over and it isn't . I loved the true ending - once it got there .
494764	342623	217869	8.0	intriguing	Needless to say , after Sixth Sense , I watched this film with high expectations . Though it's no Sixth Sense , M . Night is one of the most interesting storytellers around . He manages to hold the audience's interest even with a rather slow pace which somehow didn't feel boring . This is a film about skewed perspective - we see constant images of things upside down . It's about opposites - comic book heroes and villains , ying and yang . And , as seems to be M . Night's trademark , it's about surprises . I'll take one of his movies over any overhyped junk any day .
494204	342623	285861	8.0	Truly excellent	In " Owning Mahowny , " Philip Seymour Hoffman proved before his Oscar win that he is one of the great actors of his generation , playing a compulsive gambler who embezzles millions from the bank where he works . Mahowny is a fascinating character . He's a slob who drives an old car and is obviously cheap . He has a girlfriend ( Minnie Driver ) whom he loves , but in whom he hasn't confided very much . In fact , he lies to her , as he lies to everyone . His god is gambling - not money , just gambling . As Frank Perlin ( Maury Chaykin ) , one of the guys who takes his action attests , " He just wants to have the money to lose . " We watch Mahowny get in deeper and deeper , creating false loans and stealing from his clients . He becomes a VIP at an Atlantic City casino where he is given the best of everything and offered even more - but he's not going to do anything that takes away from his time at the tables . Unbeknownst to him , the Feds are interested in some of his associates and become curious about this Mahowny guy , thinking he may be in on a drug racket . This movie will keep you hooked throughout . Hoffman is brilliant and even sports a Canadian accent ( the film was made there and the real Mahowny is Canadian ) . Hoffman comes from my home town , and as we are close to Canada , he is familiar with the accent . He fits right in . The rest of the acting is uniformly good , with the standout being the remarkable John Hurt as the casino owner who wants Mahowny to keep throwing money at the casino and will do anything to keep him there . The insight into the gambling world is amazing - and may keep you away from the tables the next time you're in Vegas or Atlantic City .
493657	342623	39243	8.0	Technicolor adventure starring Tyrone Power	Tyrone Power is one hot Castilian as the " Captain from Castile " which costars Jean Peters , John Sutton , Cesar Romero , Thomas Gomez , Jay Silverheels , and Lee J . Cobb . Power is at his swashbuckling , heroic best as a man who flees with his family during the Spanish Inquisition to the new land , Mexico , along with Cobb and Peters . She's in love with Power . Tough acting assignment . The villain , whom Power believes he has killed , is played by John Sutton , an instrument of the Inquisition who winds up in Mexico as well after killing Power's young sister . The entire cast is great - and the scenery ! A live volcano , no less ! The music ! Sensational . A first-class production all the way . Power really didn't like doing these roles , but the public demanded them of him , and he is dashing and romantic throughout . Romero makes a fantastic Cortez . It's really difficult to single anyone out because they're all so good . John Sutton was beyond evil . Jean Peters had an interesting career at Fox . Here she is quite young and effective . Even when she was moved into second rate films , it seems as if she was always given the heavy acting role , so it's obvious that her talent was recognized by the studio . I believe that during the period in which the film was made , Power was involved with Lana Turner . Lucky woman , even if she did lose him to Linda Christian later on .
495092	342623	74554	8.0	A bookie / cashier becomes involved in the ' 50s Red Scare	Woody Allen is " The Front " for blacklisted television writers in the 1950s in a film also starring Zero Mostel , Herschel Bernardi , Andrea Marcovicci , and Michael Murphy . Several of the film's participants - director Ritt , writer Bernstein , actors Bernardi and Mostel , were themselves blacklisted . Woody's character , Howard Prince , has moments of humor , but " The Front " is a drama , and a very good one . Prince agrees to front for a writer-friend and later takes on other blacklisted writers for money . Then comes the day that Prince himself is subpoenaed by the committee , and he has to make a decision about where he stands . Along the way , Howard falls in love with a principled woman , Marcovicci , who becomes disgusted with the blacklist and quits her television job , and a pathetic comedian , Zero Mostel , who claims to have marched in a May Day parade and subscribed to a communist newspaper because he had a crush on a girl . Then he watches his career shrivel up . I grew up in the ' 50s and remember the Red Scare very well , as in school we were always told that the Communists were coming . In Hollywood and Washington , it was believed that the Communists were here infiltrating our government , films , and television . Whether it was true or not is a separate issue from the persecution and hysteria that took place . Actress Lee Remick , for instance , was blacklisted because she went to a funeral of someone who had been accused of being a Communist . John Garfield , Kim Hunter , Gale Sondergaard , Mady Christians , Larry Parks - just a few of the actors blacklisted . There are many examples of people whose careers and lives were ruined because they had once attended a meeting to see what this political ideology was all about , or had a friend who was a Communist . Land of the free indeed .
494447	342623	39725	8.0	Joan at Warner's - she ROCKS	For the young Joan Crawford , MGM was the perfect studio . All that gloss , rags to riches , Gable , and gowns . But MGM had a hard time with actresses as they aged and the old formulas weren't working anymore - Shearer , Garbo , and Crawford being three such examples . The other two quit , but Joan went over to Warner Brothers and revived her career . It was a good move . I love the Crawford films at Warner's . They were grand potboilers enlivened by her presence . Possessed is post-war , and after the war , the new rage was psychology . This movie is full of it . I'm not sure the diagnosis and terminology is correct in the film , but in layman's term , Crawford plays a total whack job . As her story unfolds to a doctor , she's a nurse taking care of Raymond Massey's wife , and she's seeing Van Heflin on a casual basis . When she falls in love with him , Heflin announces he's restless because of the war and is taking off . And that's when Joan takes off - emotionally . She becomes completely obsessed with him , and this leads to hallucinations , hysteria , and finally a psychotic break . She has able assistance by Heflin , who pops in and out and gets involved with Crawford's stepdaughter ( Crawford is now married to the widower Massey ) . When the movie begins , she's wandering the street saying " David , " which is Heflin's name in the movie . One of the posters suggested Tyrone Power for this role . I'm all for him in any movie , and it's true , the presence of a big star as David would have elevated the film to a grander status . As it is , it's an excellent vehicle for Crawford , who runs the gamut of emotions . Raymond Massey is stoic and solid as Crawford's new husband , and the lovely Geraldine Brooks , who died too soon , plays the stepdaughter . Her youthful vivacity is in sharp contrast to Crawford's borderline insanity and makes for great watching . Heflin , as the object of all the possession obsession , is smooth and detached . But make no mistake about it . This is Joan Crawford's show and she makes the most of it . The script will keep you interested , and you won't be able to take your eyes off of Joan descending into madness .
494774	342623	47437	8.0	Delicious Audrey	Audrey Hepburn is a chauffeur's daughter who sets her sets her sights on the playboy of the manor ( William Holden ) in " Sabrina , " a 1954 comedy directed and written by Billy Wilder and starring the above plus Humphrey Bogart as Linus , Holden's brother . Holden plays David - and he's the man Sabrina has loved from childhood . When she returns from studying cooking in Paris , she's grown into a beautiful , chic young woman , and David notices her for the first time . Because David is engaged to a " suitable " woman and fearful of him causing yet another scandal with a woman , Linus tries to distract Sabrina by making a play for her himself . All the actors are superb , of course , if the casting is a tad odd . As usual , Hepburn is playing opposite men many years her senior - Holden by 11 years and Bogart by 30 . People often ask the reason for this occurring again and again with Hepburn . The answer is easy . Though she is actually of the Tab Hunter-Robert Wagner era , which is the first group after the Golden Age of Hollywood , Hepburn was a much bigger star and much more sophisticated than anyone of her generation of actors - as big and sophisticated , in fact , as stars of the golden age . Therefore , she was always cast with equals . Can you see her costarring with Tab Hunter ? No . Sabrina is a perfect role for her - gamine , sophisticated in her Givenchy gowns , wide-eyed with that amazing smile . Bogart wanted Bacall in this role - she was too worldly to play Sabrina . Originally the Bogart character was to be played by Cary Grant , which makes a little , if not a lot more sense . Holden's hair was dyed blond to give him a younger appearance . At 35 , he is disarmingly handsome , very charming and quite funny . He and Bogart don't look much like brothers . A bigger problem , in my opinion , is that Hepburn and Bogart don't really click , as good as they both are in their roles , and they are great . When Wilder was asked about how difficult Bogart was , he shrugged it off . " Didn't he make fun of your accent ? " the interviewer pressed . " Oh , everyone did that , " Wilder said . " It doesn't matter . All was forgiven " - and he made reference to Bogart's dreadful death from esophageal cancer . I know many will not agree , but the only downside of this film for me was the ending - without giving anything away , I just didn't buy it . However , it is highly recommended and a wonderful movie . You might not share my feelings about the ending , which will make it even more enjoyable . Wilder told a story about not having the script finished and asking Hepburn to stall for time in filming the office scene where she pretends to be holding a board of directors meeting . " She would say she forgot a line . . . " Wilder recalled . " You see , what Marilyn did naturally , Audrey had to work at . "
494747	342623	386588	8.0	A date movie that's lots of fun	Will Smith is " Hitch , " a love doctor of sorts who counsels men on how to get the woman of their dreams . He's very successful but stays out of relationships himself . Then he meets the beautiful Sara ( Eva Mendes ) , a gossip columnist , and starts to fall in love himself . This is a very well done movie . Smith is utterly charming and likable as a sincere man who creates opportunities for men who otherwise might not meet anyone , let alone a dream girl . One such man is Albert , madly in love with a Paris Hilton type , Allegra Cole ( Amber Valletta ) , who has all of her investments at the accounting firm where he works . After a lot of coaching from Hitch , Albert gets his chance with Allegra . One of the funniest scenes in the film is Hitch showing Albert how to dance - except Albert seems himself as an expert . Another great scene is Hitch teaching Albert the ins and outs of the kiss at the door . Not only did I think Hitch had some great advice , I think it is a fine film with some very good performances , particularly by Smith and a toned-down Kevin James . They are very well directed here . Eva Mendes does a terrific job as a reporter who becomes Hitch's love interest , who herself is trying to track down this love doctor after what she perceives as wrong advice hurt her good friend . A very funny script . Highly recommended .

The film also stars Errol Flynn and Claude Rains . When Tom , the pauper , is caught by the guards , the young Prince sees a playmate in him and invites him in . They change clothes so that the Prince can go and get his dog from the kennel for their next game , but he's caught by the cruel guards who think he's the pauper . This leaves the hapless Tom stuck in the palace as a prince who is about to become king any minute . He has a protector forced upon him , the Earl of Hertford ( Rains ) , who does not have the best interests of the English people in mind . While he's in Tom's world , Prince Edward gets a good look at the horrible way the English people are forced to live because of bad laws . Eventually he meets Miles Hendon ( Flynn ) who saves him from Tom's wretched father . The question is , once Hendon is convinced that he's in the presence of the true King , can he get him to the coronation before the beggar is crowned ? This is a wonderfully fun movie , filled with the meanest of the mean in Alan Hale as a palace guard , Barton MacLane as Tom's father , and the diabolical , unfeeling Earl . All are very convincing . The twins are delightful . As for Errol Flynn , he's as dashing and charming as ever as he wields a sword and rides a horse . A great cast and a marvelous film for the whole family . Highly recommended .
494815	342623	67240	8.0	entertaining	This was a great script from the prolific Larry Cohen , who wrote episodes for " Columbo , " " Arrest and Trial " ( a forerunner of " Law and Order " ) and episodes for Kraft Suspense Theater and " The Defenders . " He has also written feature films . I'd love to see this film again - I wish it would come out on video . It stars Richard Boone as a newly-blinded actor and Suzanne Pleshette as his teacher . Though the Boone character puts on a big show for Pleshette of refusing to accept his blindness , he coldly and calculatedly trains himself to act as a seeing man so that , in disguise , he can get rid of his wife and her lover . It's a suspenseful story , a fascinating character-study and all around great entertainment . For some reason , this kind of TV movie fare has gone out of style and been replaced by women at risk films , rather slow-moving versions of Robin Cook and Mary Higgins Clark novels and the like . But we mystery buffs old enough to remember the ' 70s remember - with nostalgia - this kind of film .
493876	342623	40367	8.0	Billy visits post-war Berlin	Billy Wilder returned to Berlin after the war to film part of " A Foreign Affair , " starring Marlene Dietrich , Jean Arthur , and John Lund . Wilder lived and worked in Berlin and , following his always excellent instincts , got out and came to America just in time . In the film , a group of government people arrive in Berlin to assess the morale of the 12 , 000 American soldiers still stationed there . One of them is a congresswoman from Iowa , the very uptight and put together Miss Frost , aptly named and beautifully portrayed by Jean Arthur . When the group is taken on a tour of the city , the Berlin Wilder shows us is hideous , filled with rubble and the shells and half-shells of buildings . Frost , frantically taking notes , soon realizes with Iowan sensibility that the garbage isn't just on the surface as she sees soldiers fraternizing with Frauleins , and one woman rolling a baby buggy with an American flag attached . When two American soldiers mistake her for a Fraulein , Arthur plays along and winds up in an underground club , the Lorelei , where the star is Marlene Dietrich . Dietrich is a gorgeous woman who survived by picking up with a high-ranking Nazi official , and she's kept out of a labor camp now thanks to the protection of an army officer named Pringle , played by John Lund . When Lund romances Frost to keep her from investigating the matter , problems arise . Arthur and Dietrich are fantastic in their roles and play off each other magnificently . The casting is perfect : Two blonds , complete opposites , one worldly wise and one with a hand over her open mouth in shock , one oozing sex and the other oozing primness . Dietrich performs several numbers in her inimitable style , which is an added treat . This is Billy Wilder at his cynical best , with Pringle selling his birthday cake on the black market that Frost brings him from a constituent , and being slipped stockings for his girlfriend . He also shows how the Germans in charge bow down to Dietrich , knowing who she is . There are funny scenes , sexually overt scenes ( including a suggestion of S & M in the Dietrich-Lund relationship ) , and touching scenes in " A Foreign Affair . " Throughout , you will never be bored . This film also has the distinction of an ad-lib by John Lund that Wilder kept in the film : " Relax , baby , it's mother's day . " Relax , enjoy , and ponder - it's Billy Wilder .
495153	342623	48317	8.0	Great performances , great singing highlight the story of Ruth Etting	Doris Day portrays singing great Ruth Etting in " Love Me or Leave Me , " a 1955 film costarring James Cagney and Cameron Mitchell . The film tells the story , somewhat fictionalized , of Etting's rise to fame in the 1920s and her association and marriage to Marty " The Gimp " Snyder , a Chicago gangster . In the story , Etting is highly ambitious , and Marty helps her career after picking her up in a dance hall and realizing he's not going to get anywhere . He's hoping for the big prize - i . e . , Ruth - at the end of the rainbow , but though she's grateful , she's never going to be THAT grateful . Finally , he becomes so angry that he rapes her ( this is suggested in the film but the scene was cut by the censors ) . She marries him , though she's in love with a pianist , Marty Alderman . This film was made about five years before Ross Hunter glamorized Doris and made her the # 1 box office star in a series of comedies , three of which were with Rock Hudson . Before that , she was a pretty woman with a sweet , smooth voice and sturdy acting ability . And nowhere does she demonstrate all three qualities as she does here . And throw in a sensational figure in some stunning gowns to boot . Doris ' Ruth is a young woman who looks and acts like sugar but has the determination of steel underneath . She speaks softly but has the glint of ambition in her eye . Day's voice and style are nothing like Etting's , but the producers and director weren't looking for an imitation . Doris looks and sounds fantastic , singing a huge amount of music , including " Ten Cents a Dance , " the title song , " Chasing the Blues Away " and many others . Cagney gives an extremely powerful performance as Marty , a pushy little man with a huge insecurity and a passion for Ruth . It is a fully fleshed out portrayal of an abusive , possessive man that you can hate and pity at the same time . Cagney deservedly won an Oscar nomination for the role of Marty . He and Doris ' contrasting acting styles mesh beautifully as well . Though there were liberties taken with the Etting story , if you read her bio , it sounds just like the film . Did the movie have a ' 20s and the ' 30s feel to it ? Not really . But it doesn't matter . The film is in color and has a rich look , and what a score . What actors . A must see .
494220	342623	90863	8.0	Eddie Felson's back	" Twenty five years ago , my career ended before it had even really started , " Eddie Felson tells Vince , a young pool shark . No longer the cocky man he was in " The Hustler , " Eddie ( Paul Newman ) in 1986 is retired from pool and a successful investor . When he spots hot-shot Vince ( Tom Cruise ) , he decides to invest in him and take him on the road , with the goal of Vince winning a big pool tournament in Atlantic City . Along the way , Eddie confronts what he was and is no more and looks at the dreams he let die . When Vince is too foolish and strong-willed to take his advice , Eddie makes an important decision . Though not as strong a film as " The Hustler , " " The Color of Money " is still an excellent film with a great cast led by Newman , at the peak of his " older man " good looks and the brilliant acting he's always had . And , as usual , he tells you everything you need to know about a character . It's clear that he was content with his life and his attractive girlfriend ( Helen Shaver ) until he saw Vince . Then the old restlessness and competitiveness came creeping back into his blood . Seeing Tom Cruise in 1986 is startling since today , the lower half of his face has changed drastically due to plastic surgery . Here he conveys the raw , youthful energy that helped make him a star . Like many successful movie actors , he has a wonderful physical agility . His pompadoured Vince is a short-tempered , jealous , talented ingrate who can't help showing off . Cruise is very effective , as is Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio as his sultry , beautiful girlfriend in another role she made memorable in the ' 80s . Beautifully directed by Scorcese , " The Color of Money " shows that it's never too late to follow your dreams and , with the right actors and the right script , you can do a good sequel even 25 years after the original .
493608	342623	381061	8.0	Big and beautiful	Everything about the latest James Bond flick , " Casino Royale , " is big and first-rate . Humongous action sequences , glorious scenery , a tense plot , a to-die-for Bond , incredibly beautiful women , and villains beyond evil . Daniel Craig is Bond , and when you get a look at his body , watch out . Not to mention those turquoise eyes . He's a tough Bond with less of a sense of humor and less relaxed than some previous 007s , but he fits the 21st century very well . This " Casino Royale " is far superior to the 1967 episodic film which had huge problems including actors who refused to be in the same room with one another during scenes , different writers writing dialogue for the same scene that didn't match , things like that . This version is an actual story , with Bond going after a financier of terrorists , Le Chiffre , in order to take all the money in a poker game . Things don't work out as planned ; Bond is nearly killed right at the poker table , among other situations . And the terrorists want the money being gambled away - enough to kill and torture for it . " That's quite a body count you've been stacking up , " M ( Judi Dench ) tells Bond . Indeed , he's taking people out right and left and acting like a renegade . Bond , with his loose sexuality and attitude toward women isn't exactly a modern hero . Here , with the excellent performance of Daniel Craig , he comes closer than he has in a while to being a Bond for this century .

Rita plays a beautiful showgirl , Rusty , working at a small club owned by the man she loves , Danny ( Kelly ) . Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius ( Silvers ) , the club comedian . They all hate oysters , but they're looking for a pearl . When they find one , all three of them will have good luck , they believe . Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner ( Kruger ) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved , who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother . Once she becomes the cover girl , the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true . Danny wants her to have her success , but at the same time realizes he's lost her . " Cover Girl " has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern , with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears . Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past . For such a sexy , desirable , gorgeous woman , she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men . None of this ever showed on screen , nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star . She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life . Gene Kelly is in a serious role here , but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing . Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend . This is a very good movie with no dull spots . The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves . When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg , who plays herself in the film , speaks of getting married , she's warned by her boss not to , that she's too necessary to the modeling business . We're not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club . Why couldn't she have had both ? Nevertheless , you can't beat " Cover Girl " for top entertainment , beautiful color , lovely music , great energy , fine performances , and its most fabulous asset , the glorious Rita Hayworth .
494132	342623	377107	8.0	Excellent adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play	Gwyneth Paltrow is a young woman trying to find out who she is in " Proof , " a 2005 film also starring Anthony Hopkins , Jake Gyllenhaal and Hope Davis . As mentioned already , there are shades of " A Beautiful Mind " in this story of a formerly brilliant mathematician ( Hopkins ) and his troubled , isolated daughter ( Paltrow ) . The film goes back and forth in time , keeping the audience wondering about the outcome of the story . The basic premise is that after Catherine's father dies , a student ( Gyllenhaal ) finds a notebook among his papers with a mind-bending , phenomenal mathematical proof . The story goes from there , with a subplot of Catherine's sister Claire , who is completely divorced from the life that Catherine and her father led , wants to sell the family home and bring Catherine back to New York with her . As a further subplot , Catherine finds herself attracted to her father's student . Though this is a wonderful film that does not stray too far from the script , and the performances are wonderful , Catherine's announcement , which changes the entire story , comes in the play at the end of Act I and produced an audible gasp from the audience . This is missing here ; not only that , the line was changed and almost thrown away . Also , at the end of the play , Catherine talks about her father in a short , emotional monologue - one of the most touching parts of " Proof " - that is also missing . Of course , if you haven't seen the play , you won't miss these omissions . Mary Louise Parker originated this role on Broadway , replaced by Anne Heche and finally Jennifer Jason Leigh . Catherine fits Paltrow as if it was written for her , though she could never bring the quirkiness to it that Parker could . Paltrow shows us all of Catherine's hangups and fears - that she is too much like her father and will inherit his insanity and that if she opens up to someone , she will be hurt . Better to dress like a grunge , pull your hair off your face , slump , and fold your arms across your chest than live . With the world she had with her father gone , it's time to go out into a new one - but can she - can she accept her own abilities and allow herself to love ? It's a beautiful performance , highly emotional and compelling . Hopkins of course is magnificent as Robert , Catherine's father , who in the film is sometimes dead and sometimes alive . You'll have a hard time gaging his mental state because Hopkins gives Robert's character great conviction and intelligence . Toward the end , there is a heartbreaking scene , in flashback , between Catherine and Robert , where the audience finally understands what's been going on . Gyllenhaal is very attractive and energetic but doesn't seem quite geeky enough to be a major in mathematics . Hope Davis does a great job as Claire , the detached sister who tries a bit too hard and can never be on Catherine's wavelength ; in fact , she seems to doubt Catherine's mental and emotional stability . Truly a lovely film and powerful in its own way . But I can't forget seeing it in a live theater and hearing the audience gasp at the end of Act I . Wish there were a way to recreate that in a movie .
494387	342623	160904	8.0	Terrific series	" Spooks " is called " MI-5 " in the U . S . and is seen somewhat irregularly on the A & E Channel . It's a fantastic series about a spy organization in the U . K . , and some of the episodes are so suspenseful , they'll have you jumping out of your seat . This is a very well written and well acted series , always intriguing and always absorbing . My only complaint is the same complaint I have with a lot of shows from Britain - I have a terrible time getting some of the dialogue . Somehow I always manage to follow the story , but I've had the experience where whole conversations go by and I haven't understood a word . The British believe in " natural noise " - i . e . , they allow in background noise , and it's difficult for the ears to adjust first to the varying accents and then noise we're not used to in American TV . Nevertheless , I still love MI-5 or Spooks and wish the episodes were shown on a more regular basis . For a time they were some years ago , and it was great to look forward to them .

A brittle loudmouth , she's doesn't have not much use for her boyfriend Howard , but he's taking her to the picnic . When Hal jumps off the train to look up his old college friend Arthur , he innocently becomes a catalyst for change . In one way or another , he manages to arouse emotions - mostly sexual - in nearly everyone he meets . A braggart who gives his loose-ends , wandering life a romantic spin , he's hoping Arthur's dad will give him a job . Then he sees Madge . " Picnic " is a beautiful story about loneliness , settling for what you can get , love , frustration , and dreams left behind . Madge is sick of being the pretty one , Millie is sick of being the smart one , Rosemary is sick of being an old maid , Arthur is sick of not being a winner in his father's eyes . " Picnic " contains some memorable scenes , the best remembered being the classic " Moonglow " sequence when Madge shuns tradition and gives into her womanly feelings in one of the most erotic scenes ever filmed . William Holden is too old for the role for Hal ( his classmate , played by Cliff Robertson , is 29 ) but his casting is excellent . Virile , oozing with sex appeal and good looks , Hal turns a lot of heads when he's shirtless and when he flashes his gorgeous smile . In Madge , he sees his last chance to make something of himself ; with her as his inspiration , he can do anything . Gorgeous in lavender , Kim Novak's Madge is every man's dream , and as she makes evident in her scenes with Robertson , she isn't sure this is all there is . When she meets Hal , he awakens feelings in her she's never had . Betty Field does a beautiful job as Flo Owens , a woman who's life has been one of disappointment but hopes for a good marriage for Madge . Susan Strasberg as the geeky Millie is superb - tomboyish , with feelings for things other than English literature held inside . The main characters all believe their lives are on a set path . No one believes this more than Millie . " I will be living in New York and writing books no one reads , " she announces to her sister . But it's she who convinces Madge that for the fearless , life doesn't have to be set in stone . Arthur O'Connell is effective as Rosemary's boyfriend - though he normally goes along with her , he can be tough when necessary . The scene where he's completely overcome by the town's women and can't get a word in is a classic . Arthur's afraid of change , but his life is going to change by unanimous female consent . One of the best performances comes from veteran Verna Felton as Mrs . Potts . Her final scene with Flo Owens is so poignant as she talks about what it's meant to her to watch Flo's daughters grow up while she cares for her invalid mother . When she meets Hal , it's as if her whole existence comes alive once again . " There was a man around , and it was good , " she says . Felton essays a wonderful , wise woman with an understanding of life and love and makes the role shine . The problematic role is that of Rosemary . When people say that Picnic is dated , they're perhaps speaking of Rosemary , an old maid whose sexual desires become unbearable once she sees Hal and witnesses Hal and Madge together . " Every year I keep telling myself something will happen , " she tearfully tells Howard . " But it doesn't . " What's dated is the implication that an unmarried woman must be unfulfilled - the concept is dated , but it fits into ' 50s middle America - and don't kid yourself , step out of a big city and there are plenty of people who still feel this way . Rosemary's big confrontation scene with Howard is magnificent acting , but I frankly found Russell over the top in parts of the movie . Some of it is the character , some is not enough attention to directing her . Rosemary might be annoying , but she is also an object of pity . When you wish she'd just stop talking and leave , there's a problem . " Picnic " doesn't tell us about the rest of these peoples ' lives . The final scenes are really just the beginning . Though both Hal and Madge want to build a real life together , one wonders if they can , and if love and passion are enough to carry them through hard times . One suspects that Madge will one day return to Kansas , sadder but wiser . Hal will always have wanderlust , always put the best spin on marginal situations , and never really hold down a good job . Rosemary will be able to put on an act that she has what she wants , but that's all it will be . Without the competition of Madge , Millie may just surprise herself by blossoming , allowing the womanly part of her in , and have some opportunities in the big city that are more than career-based . In fact , of all of the characters , she perhaps has the best future in front of her . A slice of ' 50s life , thought provoking , excellent characterizations - Picnic is one of the best films of the ' 50s with two of its brightest stars . Highly recommended .
494831	342623	68248	8.0	psychic phenomenon , satanic worship and more	Leonard Nimoy stars as a race car driver with psychic visions in " Baffled ! " also starring Susan Hampshire , Vera Miles , Rachel Roberts , and Jewel Blanch . After the Nimoy character reports on television that he had a vision that caused him to lose control of his race car during a competition , he is visited by Susan Hampshire . She is a student of psychic phenomenon and believes he should follow up on what he saw - a manor house in England , the phrase " It's Wyndham in Devon , dear , " and a familiar-looking woman who is need of help . He agrees to join her after he has another vision which is much stronger - - and scarier - than the previous one . The two of them end up at a manor house which has been turned into a sort of resort hotel . There , they meet the woman of the vision - an American film star who is waiting for her ex-husband , her young daughter , and some rather strange characters . Judging by what happens at the end of this entertaining movie , " Baffled " seems to have been a pilot for a TV series . The stars - Hampshire and Nimoy - are delightful , and the story is an interesting one that manages to tie in not only psychic phenomenon but a satanic element as well . Vera Miles does an effective job as a woman anticipating a reunion with her ex , Rachel Roberts is terrific as the owner of Wyndham , and Jewel Blanch is very good as Miles ' daughter . This intriguing story will hold the viewer's interest , and it is immensely helped by the likability of the main characters .
493570	342623	433383	8.0	Clash of the Titans	Edward R . Murrow goes up against Senator Joseph McCarthy in " Good Night , and Good Luck , " a 2005 using Murrow's famous sign-off on the news program " See It Now " as its title . The stars are David Strathairn , George Clooney , Jeff Daniels , Patricia Clarkson , Ray Wise , Frank Langella , and Robert Downey , Jr . The story is set during the time of the HUAC investigations , when Murrow was one of the few newsmen willing to go up against the powerful senator who saw a Communist under every bed , Joseph McCarthy . It's an especially timely story post - as it concerns the violation of civil rights and use of fear tactics in order to exploit the insecurity rampant in the country at that time . Director / writer George Clooney couldn't have chosen a better subject . Like the film " Thirteen Days " about the Cuban missile crisis , the brilliance of the film is in its use of actual transcripts , here from " See it Now . " In the case of " Good Night , and Good Luck , " we also see real footage from the investigations and hear Joseph McCarthy himself as he goes after witnesses and Murrow . It makes for fascinating viewing . Though there were some minor errors , the attention to detail to evoke the ' 50s atmosphere is fantastic , the black and white only adding to it . The acting is superb , if you can call what David Strahairn did acting . I felt throughout the entire film that I was watching Edward R . Murrow , not someone portraying him . Strathairn is a flawless actor who becomes the character he's playing and makes every mannerism , vocal rhythm , and cigarette puff totally organic . His Murrow is tough , with internalized anger and a dry sense of humor . " I'm busy bringing down your network tonight , " he tells Paley as he refuses an invitation . Frank Langella's William Paley is marvelous , a man who tries to walk the fence but ends up falling over to one side . I probably already knew somewhere in the recesses of my mind about Don Hollenbeck , the character well portrayed by Ray Wise ; that story arc was telegraphed from the beginning . It might have been criticized for being a cliché , except of course it really happened . Hollenbeck's story was perhaps not fleshed out enough . All in all , a brilliant achievement and a sad one . Without people like Murrow , journalism has changed , and not for the better ? And the world ? Though the names of the threats and their exploiters have changed , the fault , dear Brutus , still doesn't lie within our stars , but in ourselves .

An absolutely brilliant film , unrelenting in its graphic depiction of the horrors and filth of war .

This isn't my kind of movie , nor is it for the squeamish , but it's a fantastic film .
494605	342623	41587	8.0	another winner from Joseph Mankiewicz	One of Hollywood's best directors , Joseph Mankiewicz , who gave us " All About Eve , " had a previous winner with " A Letter to Three Wives , " starring Linda Darnell , Jeanne Crain , Ann Sothern , Kirk Douglas , Paul Douglas , Jeffrey Lynn , Thelma Ritter , and Connie Gilchrist . The never-seen Addie Ross ( voice of Celeste Holm ) has run off with the husband of one of her friends - whose ? Three women look back over their marriages , each realizing she could be the one who will not come home to anyone that evening . Linda Darnell was involved with Mankiewicz during the filming of " A Letter to Three Wives " in what would be a devastating relationship for her . Her story is the most fun and interesting of the film . Lolamae works in one of Porter Hollingsway's department stores , and she manages to nab the boss by playing her cards just right . He assumes throughout their marriage that she's with him because of his money . The funniest parts of the film take place in the home Lolamae shares with her mother ( Connie Gilchrist ) and sister . They live next to the train tracks and when a train goes by , the house rattles and shakes . Each time this happens , everyone just waits patiently for the train to go by as they rattle right along with it and then takes up where they left off as if nothing happened . When Lolamae and Hollingsway announce their engagement , Gilchrist cries out , " Bingo ! " and faints ! Thelma Ritter plays Gilchrist's best friend . The two provide some of the best moments in the film - Ritter is also the maid in the home of Ann Sothern and Kirk Douglas . Lolamae and Paul are the most fully drawn couple , and the one the audience is most invested in . As with " All About Eve , " the female characters are the focal point . Sothern is married to Kirk Douglas - he's a schoolteacher and she writes for radio , so it's intellect vs . the dumbing down of America fight ; Jeanne Crain plays a woman who married upper class Jeffrey Lynn after leaving the service , and she originally feels out of her element among his tight-knit group of country club members . All of these women have to contend with the much admired ( by males ) Addie Ross , who remembers their men's birthdays , dresses beautifully , sends wonderful gifts , and has loads of class . When it was pointed out to Mankiewicz that Jeanne Crain had played a character named Deborah in two films for him , he replied , " I don't like the name Deborah , and I don't like Jeanne Crain . " Hers is the weakest storyline , but she is beautiful and gives a good performance . Lynn as her husband has very little to do . Sothern and Douglas make a spirited couple - he's at the height of his good looks , and Sothern makes the most of her witty dialogue . But in the end , the focus is on Darnell and Paul Douglas . Darnell is stunningly beautiful and , because of this , isn't often thought of as a great actress . She brings a dry humor , sexiness , and vulnerability to the role of a woman who on the surface appears clever and a little too street smart for her own good . Douglas is a wonder , a complete natural - he plays his role as if Porter could just as easily be a hardware salesman as a filthy rich department store owner . He's both endearing and sympathetic , with his dumb , lovable face and his immaculately tailored suits . While they don't look like a perfect couple , their chemistry and what's underneath their bantering dialogue makes them one . Now , which husband ran off with Addie ? See if you can figure it out during this highly entertaining and well-acted film .
494035	342623	32811	8.0	excellent MGM look at Nazis in 1933 Germany	A family is divided by two sons ' belief in " the new Germany " in " The Mortal Storm , " a 1940 film set at the time that Hitler became Chancellor of Germany . Frank Morgan plays the Jewish ( though he is only referred to as non-Aryan ) Professor Roth who has a son and a daughter Freya ( Margaret Sullavan ) with his current wife , and two stepsons ( one of whom is the most baby-faced Robert Stack you could ever imagine ) . The two boys , along with Frey's boyfriend Fritz ( Robert Young ) , have embraced the " New Germany " and follow its dictates . This causes Freya to reject Fritz and turn to friend Martin Breitner ( James Stewart ) who rejects the party and has always been secretly in love with Freya . When Martin helps a teacher being pursued by the Nazis get to Austria , Martin himself becomes a man pursued . This is an excellent film , but first , a word about accents . Here we go . I have read several comments that no one attempted an accent except of course those who already had one , like Maria Ouspenskaya , and this always makes it confusing for the viewer . HOWEVER , the acting rule is this : When a play or movie is set in a country where English is not the first language , obviously , the people in that country ARE NOT SPEAKING English . In this case , they are speaking German , not English with a German ACCENT . Therefore , one does NOT use an accent . This is true for Chekhov , Ibsen , whomever . So the fact that James Stewart " didn't even attempt an accent " is because he shouldn't have had one , nor should Margaret Sullivan , Robert Young , Frank Morgan . The movie is poignant and suspenseful , with marvelous performances by this top cast , particularly from Stewart , Morgan , and Sullavan . Sullavan , a consummate stage performer until her suicide , is underrated as a film actress but always gave excellent performances . In fact , her screen test for " Rebecca " is one of the finest seen on the documentary about the search for a Mrs . DeWinter . Some interesting features - first of all , I didn't actually recognize Robert Stack ; secondly , a very young Dan Dailey has a rare dramatic turn as a Hitler youth ; thirdly , one questions escape to Austria , except that in 1933 , Austria was still available to flee to . At this time in Germany , artists like Billy Wilder were escaping to Berlin as well , and many left the country from there . The movie talks around the subject of Jews , never referring to anyone as Jewish , and it does not actually refer to the Nazi party though swastikas abound . This makes " The Mortal Storm " all the more fascinating . The best feature of the movie is that it's about a simple , happy family who live among friends in a university town in Southern Germany , and how the rise of Hitler broke that family apart and changed and ruined the lives of ordinary people . One thinks of the Franks and the families like the one characterized in " The Mortal Storm , " with hopes and dreams and ambitions . If they were among the very fortunate , those hopes , dreams and ambitions were put on hold for over a decade ; if not , they were wiped out by complete evil . Hitler hated this film . Gee , I wonder why .

Part biography , part filmography , part home movies , this is a delightful look at the actor , his family and his friends over the years . His children , Juliet , Hayley and Jonathan talk about growing up in different houses and being on various film sets and on vacation ; Mills talks about his career , his life and his marriage , with much film taken behind the scenes of various films and of stars visiting his home - Stewart Granger , Jean Simmons , Tyrone Power , David Niven , Dirk Bogarde , Sir Laurence Olivier , Vivien Leigh , Joan Plowright , Ian McShane and many others . Most poignant is Mills singing a love song to his wife ; at the time , unlike shots of her as a vibrant , happy redhead in many of his movies , she seems somewhat out of it but attentive - a sad and beautiful moment . For those of us who are baby boomers and for whom John Mills was merely Hayley's father while we were growing up , this is a wonderful look at a distinguished family of actors and one of the finest British actors , John Mills , from the time he was a young man . It's always bittersweet to see the story of someone's life from youth to old age but in this case , it was a triumphant life and well worth experiencing .
493512	342623	37248	8.0	Really good Holmes entry	" The Scarlet Claw " is an unusual Sherlock Holmes mystery in that it takes place in Canada . Holmes and Watson are in Quebec at an occult society meeting when they hear about a village legend involving a phantom that killed three villagers . There are fears that the phantom has returned - some sheep killed , some strange sitings , and then a woman , Lady Penrose , is found murdered . Lord Penrose ( Paul Cavanagh ) is at the same meeting as Holmes and Watson . Holmes in fact later receives a letter from the woman asking for his help . The detective and his doctor friend then go to investigate , and find a lot more than anyone bargained for - no phantom , but a flesh and blood killer . Good ensemble work , rich atmosphere , and a supernatural story will remind one of Hound of the Baskervilles . While Holmes and Watson have a great adventure in " La Morte Rouge , " the name of the town , it's not quite The Hound of the Baskervilles . It is , however , an excellent - maybe the best - entry into the Universal series , and audiences won't be disappointed .
493733	342623	58997	8.0	The imaginary world of children	Sir Laurence Olivier , Carol Lynley , Keir Dullea and Noel Coward star in " Bunny Lake is Missing , " a 1965 black and white British film directed by Otto Preminger . A young woman , Ann Lake ( Lynley ) and her brother Steven ( Dullea ) report the woman's little girl , nicknamed Bunny , missing when she can't be found at her school on her first day of class . The detective in charge , Supt . Newhouse ( Olivier ) soon finds out that Bunny's things are disappearing from the new apartment where she , her mother and uncle live , and Newhouse begins to wonder if Bunny ever existed at all . This is a dark , atmospheric film that takes the viewer into an adult world where a child's fantasy life is explored and often accepted - the cofounder of the school on its top floor listening to children's dreams on tape as she writes a book about children's fantasies ; the man who runs the doll hospital ; and Ann herself , who had an imaginary friend as a child called Bunny , named after a character in a book . Is Bunny Lake missing ? Was there ever a Bunny Lake ? Is Steven trying to cover for his sister ? " Bunny Lake is Missing " is very offbeat and will make you uneasy as you , along with Newhouse , try to figure out what's going on . The acting is very good - Olivier obviously did this role for money - there is nothing particularly interesting about it , though he does a good job . The pretty Lynley gives an ambiguous performance - she's either a grieving mother , a nut , or both , and Dullea is equally ambiguous - does he know more than he says he does ? Is he placating his sister ? Noel Coward has a showy if small role as the Lake's landlord , a rather strange bird into S & M who proudly shows one of the detectives the skull of the Marquis de Sade . Though not entirely satisfying , this is a great movie to see on a Sunday afternoon . It takes you right into the darkness of London and leaves you there as it travels through a child's strange world and comes out in illusion ? Reality ? Or madness ?
493611	342623	43465	9.0	The story of a tightly wired detective and his view of the world	Kirk Douglas is the man referred to in the title " Detective Story , " a 1951 film based on Sidney Kingsley's play . Directed by William Wyler , the movie features several actors from the Broadway production : Horace Mcmahon , Joseph Wiseman and Lee Grant , who appear with Eleanor Parker , William Bendix , Frank Faylen , George Macready , Gerald Mohr and Cathy O'Donnell . " Detective Story " covers a busy day in a New York City precinct with its traffic of shoplifters , small-time hoods , a first time embezzler , and work on old cases . Douglas plays Det . James McLeod , who is a complete hard-nose as a detective and always one punch short of a police brutality charge . He sees the world as black and white due to being raised by a crooked father and a frail , mentally disturbed mother who eventually went into a institution . When a young man , a war hero , is brought in for stealing from his boss in a desperate moment , McLeod insists on throwing the book at him , even though the boss was convinced by another detective ( William Bendix ) to drop the charges . " You can't be soft , " McLeod says . " My mother was soft , and it killed her . " He's determined , and has worked for a year , to try to put away a backstreet doctor named Schneider ( George Macready ) . Schneider's lawyer has his client photographed in the nude to show as evidence in case he's roughed up , which he knows McLeod is capable of doing . When the attorney starts dropping hints to Lt . Monaghan that McLeod may have a personal vendetta against the doctor , Monaghan starts to worry . Perhaps I'm dense but I was not clear on exactly what kind of doctor Schneider was . Whether he was performing late-term abortions ( which of course the script can't say ) or an illegal adoption ring was hard to figure out . It appears that in the play , Schneider was an abortionist but because of the code , he's running some sort of adoption ring here . What was confusing in the film was that there were references to women whose babies had died . Obviously he was pathetic at his job . The only " soft " part of McLeod's life is his happy marriage and the love that he and his wife ( Eleanor Parker ) feel for one another . But his inner rage , his rigidness , and unreasonable expectations begin to threaten that too . One of the great things about this film is that it does not seem like a filmed play - you could easily believe it was written for the screen . The performances , for the most part , are marvelous , from the fair but tough Monaghan , the light-hearted cop ( Faylen ) , the warm cop ( Bendix ) and the assorted punks and first-time offenders . Lee Remick , in her film debut , plays a shoplifter who has to wait for night court ; consequently , she's in the precinct office at all times . She's very good but like many before her and after her , the New York accent sounds phony . It's a tough one to make organic - several times she nearly succeeds but other times it's obviously put on . Eleanor Parker , as McLeod's sweet , beautiful and loving wife is excellent . She and Douglas have a powerful scene where her devotion turns to shock , then sorrow , then the realization that she doesn't know this man at all . Douglas is superb as McLeod . His character carries an underbelly of anger and viciousness which is always there , even when he is pretending to have a nice conversation with a criminal . You just wait for him to blow . His clenched jaw and tight way of speaking fit this role perfectly . When he's initially with his wife , he's loving and tender . Their love is his only solace , but he's too poisoned to see a shade of gray just once . Somehow , as mean and unbending as he is , you can't help but feel sorry for him because you can see that it's ruining him . The end of the film is very powerful . It's funny - Douglas ' own son says his father isn't considered a great actor now because of a somewhat dated approach to these strong roles that today seems too intense and done with a voice that has been imitated once too often - yet I can't remember seeing him in a film where I didn't think he was excellent . Smoothly directed by William Wyler , who keeps the action and subplots going and gets some wonderful performances and New York atmosphere , " Detective Story " is one not to miss .
495011	342623	39631	9.0	Brilliant black comedy with a very serious message	Charlie Chaplin is " Monsieur Verdoux " in this 1947 film based on the real-life serial killer Henri Landru . Verdoux is a bank clerk who is laid off late in life and turns to marrying and killing women for their money in order to support his invalid wife and child . Sounds brutal , and when you think about it , it really is , but Chaplin as usual manages to couch his message in comedy . While we see that he is successful in knocking off a couple of women and getting their money ( though we never actually see a murder ) , Verdoux has a couple of failures as well , and there the fun begins . One of his women , Annabella Bonheur , is played hysterically by Martha Raye as a vulgar loudmouth eternally suspicious of Verdoux , who is posing as a boat captain . He tries some different ways of killing her , but no matter what he does , nothing works . He then turns his attention to another woman he's been chasing for some time , Marie Grosnay ( Isobel Elsom ) . He's about to walk down the aisle when who does he see as a guest at the wedding - Annabelle . His attempts to get out of the house are priceless . Despite some genuinely comical scenes , the speech that Verdoux makes gives its deeper message - Verdoux was in it for the money . To him , the women were business propositions to be exploited . His point is that what he has done on a smaller scale is being done by dictators worldwide ; people are not treated as human beings but merely for economic gain , for power and for exploitation . Though Verdoux's argument doesn't absolve him of responsibility or justify his actions , the warning is a good one - people need to care more about each other and about what's going on in their world , and put their attention on really important matters like suppression of the masses . Why , he asks , are the headlines full of Verdoux and not of what is going on around the world ? ( The film's ending takes place in 1937 . ) It's interesting to consider what would have happened to this story in the hands of Orson Welles , whose idea it was originally . He wouldn't have made it a comedy . It would have been a drama or a detective story . Only Chaplin would think of making the story of a serial killer into a comedy of sorts . Certainly 1967's " No Way to Treat a Lady " takes a page or so from this script . " Monsieur Verdoux " wasn't well received by the public - at all - and by 1947 , people were questioning Chaplin's politics instead of reveling in his genius . It possibly was ahead of its time ; it certainly wasn't appreciated as it is today . The movie is not without some problems , the biggest one being , what the heck happened to Verdoux's wife and child ? It is never explained . " Wars , conflicts - it's all business . One murder makes a villain ; millions a hero . Numbers sanctify . " Charlie Chaplin as Verdoux said that 61 years ago .
494634	342623	338751	9.0	a mad genius	You really can't miss when doing a biography of Howard Hughes , certainly one of the most brilliant , glamorous , eccentric , and fascinating men who ever lived . And for me , Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorcese don't miss . DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is a revelation . ( I'll digress here to say , for those who have accused him of being short , I've seen him in person - he's not short . ) He does a fantastic job as Hughes . You can almost hear his inner dialogue . As for Scorcese , the movie is truly spectacular in its breadth . I was disappointed in a couple of elements . One was , with the care Cate Blanchett gave to her portrayal of Hepburn , one would have hoped that a little attention had been paid to the casting of the other women in Hughes ' life : Faith Domergue , Ava Gardner , Jean Harlow . Of the three , I liked Kate Beckinsale's Ava the best - but for me , Ava Gardner's beauty is unparalleled . Beckinsale really didn't approach it . And Stefani was wrong , wrong , wrong . How hard can it be to find a young actress ( and Harlow was 19 , not 35 , when she appeared in Hell's Angel's ) , and slap a platinum wig and a white clinging gown on her ? Harlow's look was very distinctive , and when it's off , it's distracting . The other thing I was disappointed in - and I suppose this couldn't be helped in a way - was the telescoping of the years and some unnecessary inaccuracies . I don't pretend to be an expert on Hughes . I've seen one documentary on him which was fantastic , and now I want to read about him . But Katharine Hepburn talks about the press showing up at her brother's funeral - I don't know why that would have been , since she wasn't famous yet . I realize her family was prominent , but she made it sound as if it had to do with her fame . She also labels herself as Box Office Poison way too soon , and the movie skips the entire Philadelphia Story , including Hughes giving her the money to buy the rights . No mention of most of the controversy over " The Outlaw " which took several years to see a release . But these are minor , nitpicky points . This is a big , gorgeous film , with exciting , lush scenes and some fantastic performances .

Peter Weir does an incredible job at evoking the atmosphere of poverty , homelessness , crowds , oppression , danger , and ugly Americans in this film , and also what it feels like to be a foreigner . Guy Hamilton , the Australian reporter , is determined that this assignment will pay off for him , and it is his good luck that a tiny photographer , Billy Kwan ( Hunt ) offers to help him make connections . He likes Guy , he believes that Guy is a good man and will help to get the true story of what is happening in Indonesia out to the rest of the world . What he doesn't count on is Guy's ambition and his journalistic commitment . Neither does the woman he loves , Jill ( Weaver ) , who works for a military attaché . Because of this , she makes a costly mistake . Sukarno , says Billy , is thought of as a puppetmaster ; Billy sees himself as one , but for orchestrating gentler things , like love , helping the poor , and getting out the story of Indonesia's people . In the end , Guy sees himself as a puppetmaster too , with his hands on the story of the year . But as Sukarno becomes a puppet , so does Billy , although willingly , and Guy becomes one himself , not able to do what he originally intended . Mel Gibson has become such a controversial figure today , with his The Passion of the Christ , his arrest , and his racial remarks . There was a time when he was one of the biggest stars in the world , and it's easy to see why here . Handsome , confident , and passionate , he is an effective Guy . The beautiful Sigourney Weaver , who not long before this movie had voice lessons in New York right after mine , does a wonderful job here . Of course , the role doesn't begin to tap her talent . I remember her in person as very tall , very slender , and very sweet ; her beauty and presence radiate from the screen . The star of the film is in reality Linda Hamilton , whose portrayal of Billy Kwan not only won her an Oscar , but gave her a unique place in film history . She totally inhabits Billy . An amazing character , fully fleshed out by her brilliant acting . The last scenes in this film are sobering and scary , and the audience really feels the sense of urgency and danger . Fantastic movie . Even if it were horrible , Linda Hunt's performance has to be seen .

494344	342623	32599	9.0	Another version of " The Front Page " starring Grant and Russell	Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell make great sparring partners in " His Girl Friday , " a remake of " The Front Page . " Grant plays the conniving newspaper publisher Walter Johnson , and Rosalind Russell is the reporter Hildy Johnson , a woman this time , and Johnson's ex-wife . She's trying to get remarried , move to Albany , and quit the newspaper business , but Walter can't bear it . He cons her into helping out with a controversial death row case and then makes sure her fiancée ( Ralph Bellamy ) suffers a series of mishaps - arrest for stealing a watch , arrest for " mashing , " arrest for counterfeiting , and the theft of his wallet . This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams , a man due to be hung the next day . . . and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation . It's madcap , all right , and there are no two better people to carry it off than Grant and Russell , who make a great team . It's a hilarious story , with the most rapid-fire , non-stop dialog ever heard anywhere , often with several conversations going on at once . It's exhausting trying to keep up with it . Strangely , without computers and cell phones , the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on . It's as Hildy describes - no set schedule , no normal meals , and long hours . Nothing much has changed . This is a frenetic comedy , and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious , this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot , though it drives the main story . " The Front Page " is a favorite of Hollywood's , remade many times - three versions under its original title , a TV series , two TV productions , plus the film " Switching Channels . " And of course , " His Girl Friday , " possibly the best of all of them .
493929	342623	212061	9.0	black widower on the prowl	This is a fantastic episode from the " Thriller " series that benefits from a brilliant performance by Helen Mirren . I personally know her work from a later era , but here , she is only 29 . The story concerns a black widower , Mark , who meets , charms , and marries wealthy women , and then kills them , making it look like an accident . Now he's on the prowl again , hanging out at a health club , and there he meets Mirren , a lovely young woman with a beautiful figure . He finds himself drawn to her . However , he soon meets the irrepressible Angie , who in a way is more his type - older and rich . She's also homely and boisterous . Mark wants to have his cake and eat it , too . And that's where I'll leave this brilliant Brian Clemens story . It's a real treat . The question is , how to see it . I understand that at least some of the Thriller series is out on DVD in England . Also , I suggest looking on the Internet and checking with some Mirren collectors . It's well worth locating .
494088	342623	338013	10.0	Memory can change . . . the heart prevails	It's hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over saying ( paraphrasing ) : " Valentine's Day was created by card companies to make everybody feel like crap . " Right afterward , I watched Jim Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door , and I said , this is for me . Carrey , in a complete turnabout , plays Joel , a lonely man who falls in love with a lively , quirky nut named Clementine . The romance progresses , fights ensue , and one day , Joel walks into the bookstore where Clementine works , and she's making out with someone else and doesn't seem to even recognize him . Then their friends receive a note saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory , and they shouldn't mention him again . Joel heads to the clinic himself to find out what's going on . There he finds programmers who can draw a map of your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them . Joel decides to have the procedure . Part of the way through it , he tries desperately to stop it , to find some way to remember Clementine , bringing her into places and memories where she never was . The programmers ( Elijah Wood , Thomas Ryan ) don't notice anything odd about the procedure because they're busy drinking , dancing in their underwear and doing drugs with Mary ( Kirsten Dunst ) a secretary at the clinic . When they finally notice a problem , the head man ( Howard Wilkinson ) is called in . Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel's brain as he desperately tries to hold onto her . A spectacular story with a few twists along the way , and spectacular acting , particularly from Carrey , Winslet and Dunst , make this a real winner . Carrey is a sympathetic , warm character , Winslet is adorable and charming , and Dunst is a complete natural , be she stoned in her underwear , trying to talk sense under the influence , or crying . They are wonderful as is the rest of the cast . " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " is about the death of memory but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes without knowing why . A beautiful , beautiful film .
494321	342623	299658	10.0	This isn't your mother's movie musical !	It's amazing , after seeing Chicago , to contemplate how the movie musical has changed over the years . Thinking back to the musicals in my own era - " West Side Story , " " My Fair Lady , " " Sound of Music , " and " Music Man , " one is struck by how entire numbers were performed straight through . Then came MTV , and that all changed . Our attention spans today will not tolerate sitting through someone singing an entire number . That being said , Chicago is an exciting movie with wonderful performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones , Renee Zwelleger , Richard Gere , John C . Reilly , and Queen Latifah . And let's not forget the dancers - they're phenomenal . I think my favorite numbers were Zeta-Jones ' " I Can't Do It Alone " ; the prison " He Had It Coming , " and that great finale . Zwelleger is a true chameleon , so tiny and very much the ' 30s blonde . I saw this movie at the Ziegfeld in New York , the perfect place to see it .
494697	342623	105488	10.0	Love is in the air	Before " Dancing with the Stars , " there was " Strictly Ballroom , " a 1992 Australian film written and directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Paul Mercurio , Tara Morice , Bill Hunter and the late Pat Thomson , who died before the film was released . There's not much of a story - it's about an innovative dancer , Scott Hastings ( Mercurio ) whose parents ( Thomson and Barry Otto ) run a dance studio . The beginning is done in documentary style as his mother , Janet Leigh on crack , relates , her voice trembling with emotion , that it's Scott's year to win the Pan Pacific Grand Prix dance competition . Unfortunately , during the regionals , he broke out and did non-sanctioned steps , and his partner deserted him . This is all treated with the seriousness of a brain operation , which makes the film even more hilarious . A nerdy girl named Fran approaches Scott in the studio and asks to partner with him . He gives her a chance , and then needs to make a decision - win the Pan Pacific or do his own thing on the dance floor . On the way to the competition , some family secrets are revealed , and he and Fran fall in love . Told with hilarity , poignancy , and beautiful dancing , this is one of the all-time great dance films with Mercurio's electrifying moves , hot body , and good looks raising it to a very high level . Luhrmann's fast-paced and creative direction makes the film fly by . Some of the photography is spectacular : dancing in front of the neon Coca-Cola sign , Scott learning the paso doble from Fran's relatives as a train passes by , a kiss at twilight , and the color-mad , cartoon-like flashback scene near the end of the film . The dance sequences themselves are fabulous , with the outrageous costumes , wild hair and beautiful steps . All of the performances are good , but my favorite by far is Thomson as a former ballroom star who puts on her " happy face " though her heart is breaking , i . e . , Scott doesn't have a partner , Scott won't dance the correct steps - her constant near hysterics and overly dramatic concern are fantastic . The undertone of the film concerns the slimy , toupeed head of the regulatory committee Barry Fife ( Hunter ) who wants ballroom dance to remain conservative and by the book . Given the interior battles in the ice dancing arena , it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing exists in ballroom as well . No selfish , crowd-pleasing steps ! Just make it - strictly ballroom . If you've never seen this gem , go out and get it .
493527	342623	120689	10.0	overwhelming	This knockout of a movie is the best of the Stephen King " morality " films such as the wonderful " Shawshank Redemption " and the TV versions of " The Stand " and " Storm of the Century " . " Green Mile " manages to inspire and devastate at the same time . The casting is interesting , utilizing such actors as Bonnie Hunt and Dabbs Greer brilliantly and everyone performs with warmth and deep feeling . Hanks , of course , is the glue . Michael Clarke Duncan is powerful in his simplicity . This is a film that will never leave me .
494183	342623	41615	10.0	Stupendous	Jennifer Jones is " Madame Bovary " in this 1949 adaptation of Flaubert's novel , directed by Vincente Minnelli and also starring Van Heflin , James Mason , Louis Jourdan , Gene Lockhart , Alf Kjellin and Ellen Corby . The film starts with Flaubert , on trial for indecency . As he defends the book , he tells the story of Emma Bovary , a delusional young woman living on a farm who , from romantic novels , has unrealistic ideas about love and happiness . She nabs a simple country doctor ( Van Heflin ) and proceeds to buy herself an incredible wardrobe and live as a rich woman , even though she and her husband are not wealthy . She has a little girl whom she ignores , leaving her to the nurse ( Corby ) . Emma soon becomes bored and attempts to seduce a young man ( Kjellin ) , but his mother ( Gladys Cooper ) catches on and sends him to Paris . Then she meets Boulanger ( Jourdan ) at a party , becomes his lover and plans to run away with him to Italy - but he sees what high maintenance she is and takes off without her . In an attempt to make her husband more prominent , she attempts to talk him into performing a new surgery , but he refuses ( in the book , however , he's ambitious as well and does the surgery , which is a failure ) . Meanwhile , unbeknownst to her husband , she owes a fortune , and if she doesn't find a way out , the family is due to lose their home and furnishings . " Madame Bovary " is one of the most stunning films ever made , with a captivating performance by Jones who makes Emma pathetic , desperate , frantic and sympathetic . As one of the comments on the board pointed out , it's easy to make Emma unlikable . With Jones ' natural charm making her likable and somewhat sweet , we can see ourselves in Emma . She has great backup from Heflin as her cowed husband . Jourdan is handsome and arrogant - he sees his future with Emma , and he doesn't like it . Minnelli handles every detail beautifully in this film . Not enough can be said about the waltz at the party , its dizzying effects making it one of the most thrilling scenes on film . When Emma later puts on the same gown and looks in the mirror and remembers that night , we know for her it was the ultimate dream evening , when she become one with the heroines of the novels she read . The gowns - well , there have been beautiful gowns in films - the 1938 Marie Antoinette comes to mind - and , as in that film , these gowns are works of art , particularly the white ball gown . When Boulanger returns from Italy , and Emma goes to see him , she actually looks different - tired and older - the subtlety of the makeup is spectacular . Though set in France in the mid-1800s , Madame Bovary is a classic because it deals with an ordinary person so dazzled by illusion that she cannot accept anything about her life as it exists . How apropos for today , when the media bludgeons us with multimillion dollar homes , heiresses who go to parties every night , size zero , red carpet premieres - it's hard to be happy when you're a housewife in sweats paying $4 a gallon for gas . Even before films , television , the tabloids and the Internet , people weren't satisfied with their lives because they were told to compare their inside with someone else's outside and found themselves not measuring up . " Madame Bovary " isn't an immorality tale , it's a morality tale and , of course , Flaubert was acquitted . It's considered one of the two greatest novels ever written , along with Anna Karenina , and it's perfectly adapted for film in the 1949 version - the story of a woman who thinks that shopping on credit till she drops is the way to real happiness . Like many in the 20th and 21st centuries have found , she was wrong .
